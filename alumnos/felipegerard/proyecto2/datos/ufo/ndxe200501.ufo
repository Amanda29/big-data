When I looked to see what he saw he told me that they were just underneath the plane he was pointing at. The object that he said was a plane was orange in color and was moving very slowly toward the north. It had no blinking lights but just a steady orange glow and seemed to be fairly high up and far away. As I was waiting to see fireworks in that vicinity I saw a light fall directly down from the object. It was smaller than the large light but the same color and was falling straight down for about seven or eight seconds and then would disappear. My first thought was that it could be an airplane breaking up, but the larger light continued to move slowly then eventually looked like it stopped from our viewpoint. As it was stopped we saw the same balls of light fall from it four more times, each one disappearing after about five to ten seconds. The larger object then began to move again due east and appeared to be climbing in altitude, and another light dropped from beneath it. This fell straight downward until it disappeared. We watched as the large orange light continued east and got smaller until it vanished about 50 degrees up in the horizon. We live in an area with lots of commercial and military air traffic and I have never seen anything like this.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Coming over the trees was an elongated triangular shaped &#34;thing.&#34;  It was hovering over the east end of the small farm pond I was fishing.  It moved over the frozen water and lowered slowly.  It sat motionless without a sound for a minute or two.  As it rose silently, &#34;steam&#34; rose from the lake.  The object slipped quietly past the trees and floated out of sight (my line of sight was obscured by trees).  We used our cell phone and called the local sherriff, but there was no answer, as our cell phones had both gone dead.  This was strange.  Also, our battery operated fish locator (Vexilar) was also affected, we believe.  The area of the pond where the object hovered was melted into about 2 inches.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The night sky was clear and I always look up to see the stars.  I saw a dark, boomerang shaped object pass overhead well below airline traffic going from East to West.  There were approximately six round shaped objects of the same size on the bottom side (possibly could have been lights)unlit, but seemed they could have been slightly illuminated.  It moved at a steady, quiet speed.  As I watched it pass over my house it seemed to disappear in the night sky. No visible lights to follow its movement.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
1/31/05 19:00|Penn Valley|CA|Other|5 minutes|VERY Large Craft silently flys overhead slowly to the east, accompanied by large electric blue explosion|2/8/05|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/041/S41718.html|4|ndxe200501| VERY Large Craft silently flys overhead slowly to the east, accompanied by large electric blue explosion<n> <n><n> <n><n> At 6:15 the power went out at our house. we live in the foothills around a lake and when the power goes out I get a great view of the stars without light pollution. about 7:00pm pst. I went outside to look at the stars. The winds had picked up to substantially. It was difficult to stand, news reports gust of 60mph+ I was looking up not thinking much of the insane wind. When what appeared to be a very large almost rectangular craft.(only slightly more narrow in the front.) It was extremely large. But its difficult to say how big because it seemed that it may have been really big but at 5000ft. (maybe the size of half a football field.) or maybe smaller at a lower altitude. I can say from my perspective if I put a small pizza box (6&#34;x6&#34;) at arms length it wouldnt have covered the entire craft. It had 4 circular dim amberish/yellow lights on each corner of the craft that appeared to emit some sort of haze. That had an amber color. It moved very slowly. Taking several seconds to come into complete view as it pass directly over my house. One look at it and I knew it wasnt normal. No wings no blinking aircraft lights of anykind. And absolutely quiet. I ran inside and got my girlfriend  She ran out and got really frightened nearly in tears saying &#34;oh my god oh my god, What is that thing!?!?&#34; The winds were very intense. The craft continued on its easterly course.  It was visible until it passed over the horizon. We got a fairly good view of the bottom of the craft, being able to see that the bottom wasnt completely flat. but had several ridges running from front to back. Once the craft was out of sight we went inside because the winds were blowing fiercly. Perplexed by what happened we discussed it for a moment I then said &#34;I gotta see another one&#34; We went outside again and looked skyward. about 5 minutes after the craft had flown over. To the northeast a VERY large dome shaped deep blue flash went off. The flash was very odd. It appeared to explode then implode. It appeared to be behind some hills and a distance away. The explosion expanded in a dome fashion and took up approximately 1/20 of the sky.  We both got very scared at that time. The light was bright enough to light up the entire sky. About 20 minutes later the wind was back to being ABSOLUTELY DEAD CALM. I dont know what to think about it. One thing we did notice was many airplanes were in the area after this happened. up to 10-15 (not that it means much we arent to far from sacramento international and beale AFB) It appears others in my community saw the same thing. As we saw many people with pointing spot lights in the sky after the display.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Today. I looked in the paper and the cause of the power outage was still unknown. Since then they have released an update saying that 2 - 60kv wires hit each other causing the blackout. I wonder if the 2 lines hitting, is the explosion we saw. Which occured 1 hour after the power went out(it wasnt windy when the power first went out. Not even a breeze). Or obviously the powerfailure and wind can be completely unrelated to the ufo. I know what I saw that is for sure and it wasnt an airplane, helicopter or a blimp. Although my skeptical side reminds me that I do live only a few miles from Beale AFB. This might have been some sort of US craft. I am a helicopter pilot, fixed wing airplane pilot and I star gaze regularly. I have never seen anything like this before in my life.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We have attempted on two occasions to correspond with the witnesses to this alleged sighting, but they have not responded.  We have turned the case over to MUFON in California, and they will pursue the matter.  PD))<n>

(not good at guessing how far away it was from the jet, but from my prespective it was 5-6 inches, which i guess would be 1,000 feet maybe ??? ) anyways it was round, a perfect sphere, silver, and very shiney. The reason it caught my eye was because it was leaving no vapor trail at all, and it wasn&#39;t moving, well it was moving, but like perfectly with the jet, except it would move side to side a little. then all of a sudden it disapeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I looked up at the morning sky that was an orangish color because the sun was just rising but I couldn&#39;t see the sun, because of the 3 apartment building blocking the sun. I looked at the sky the sky to behold it beauty before going to school. As I stare at the sky I saw an object like a saucer but a slight hump on the top and bottom of the saucer that was connected. the orangish sun reflected off the unidentified flying object. It was in one spot then it appeard a mile to the side it was preveously at it was about 20 miles away.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The location was on 11th street and the object, hovering  above a corn field looked like it was at least ten miles to the west. The object stayed in the sky moving from side to side for about ten minutes then after watching it appeared to be gone. In this ten minute time period the oval shaped object let out a few bursts of light like it was glowing and shone a blinding bright light down to the ground an started lifting up objects. We arent sure what the object was but it most likely, with the size and shape it was, was an angus cow.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous.  PD))<n>
1/30/05 23:12|Modesto|CA|Chevron|5 -10 secs|5 white lights arranged in chevron pattern, silent|2/8/05|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/041/S41693.html|9|ndxe200501| 5 white lights arranged in chevron pattern, silent<n> <n><n> <n><n> After I (along with two others) witnessed a strange, silent &#34;Y&#34; or chevron-shaped aircraft two nights ago, I decided to stand out again on my back porch at around the same time of night, curious to see if it would appear again. At around 11:12 pm, I was facing westward, when I noticed 5 relatively dim white lights, arranged in a chevron pattern, over my left shoulder.  It was travelling from a southeast to northwest direction.  This time, I was not able to discern the outline of an associated fuselage.  There were no starboard, port, or flashing &#34;running&#34; lights, as would be expected of a normal airplane.  I estimate the altitude at around 1000 feet or less, and the speed was about what you would expect from a private jet.  I would say the size was that of a B-2 bomber.  However, it was completely silent.  It had a straight flight path, and a constant speed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Having lived in the area for some time, I know the normal flight patterns and altitude of commercial aircraft on approach to the Bay area, and small private aircraft from nearby smaller airports. This definitely did not fit the appearance of either.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Now that I&#39;ve witnessed this a second time, I believe it must be some type of advanced military aircraft.  I&#39;m going to try to get a picture of it tomorrow night, if on the off chance it appears again.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Off to the right of the freeway was an intensly bright white/yellow light. The light was so blinding that I held my hand up to shield my eyes while trying to figure out what the object we were seeing was. A police officer was also on the freeway, he was out of his car also staring at the object. The object did not appear to be moving, it was flashing its lights in a three on-off pattern. The object remained for about two minutes, flashed three more times and then was gone. Freeway traffic began to pick up once again and I did not see the object anymore.<n>

There are a lack of reference points in a clear night sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Within a 30 seconds all conversation stopped as one by one my fellow travellers noticed said orange sphere.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It occured to me that it would overfly our position on the ground and so i attempted to take a photograph with my Canon Eos 300D camera. The camera failed to operete for unexplicable reason. (not done that before or since) As the light passed over us it changed vector by about 5 or six degrees with no discernable change in speed. Not a satellite then i thought.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We discussed what it could be amongst ourselves but failed to come up with a rational explanation.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Hot air ballon ? ..... that would account for the orange/red aura (flame) But the object was travelling too fast for a ballooon and then of course there was that noticable vector change. Not to mention it would be a very foolish balloonist to fly in total darkness.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The orange glow it generated seemed to flicker and change to a slight reddish tinge from time to time. It varied a little in intensity of brightness.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object made no sound at all that we could discern.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It kept its speed as it dissapeared into the distance, heading roughly North west.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On my return to the UK i researched said object on internet and discovered an article describing several similar sounding objects flying above Chiang Mai on Feb 7th.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have always kept an open mind regarding UFO`s.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My mind is that little bit more open following my experience in Thailand.<n> <n><n> <n><n> To my mind this was literally a flying object that was unidentified.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I would be interested in hearing from anyone else who witnessed this object or similar objects.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Sorry, no pictures.

There are no street lights and the road is surrounded by forest. On a side note half of yelm (the forest) is owned by the military.. Fort Lewis. So nathan and I were rocking out to the music and all of sudden I see this aircraft hoovering above the trees right beside the highway. The aircraft was traingular and had two square lights at the bottom and there was no cockpit in sight. It was thick and it had a light at every corner. We were driving by it slowly but some dumbass was on our ass looking at the thing too, we almost get in a car accident. We manage to recover and just drive away. I kept looking at the aircraft trying to see if I could find any of resemblance to our aircrafts. The oddest thing was that it hoovered and there was no sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Based on the disappearing background of stars, the object gave the appearance of a vee.  Based on my point of view, the object was very large.  I could not judge the altitude but had the impression it was not as high as a jet in the normal departure altitude (from Sac Intl. The lights were solid but very dim.  There was no sound.  I waited 30 seconds for a jet sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I just finished viewing the comet and turned to the south and caught a fast movement of an object moving from west to east.  As I looked in a direction of approx SE the object was visible for approx 3 seconds before it vanished in the east.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am use to seeing jets and hearing them a few seconds later.  To the north, approx 40 degrees was an airplane displaying appropriate lights traveleing to the north.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Earlier I saw a satelite moveing north to south.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This definitely was not a satelite and did not match any sound, sight or behavior of an any aircraft I&#39;ve ever seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

1/29/05 01:00|Carson|CA|Unknown|3-5 minutes|Reddish object produced flashes of light, discharged a gaseus material, dissappeared, reappeared and dissapeared again.|5/11/05|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/042/S42436.html|17|ndxe200501| Reddish object produced flashes of light, discharged a gaseous material, dissappeared, reappeared and dissapeared again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have witnessed at least 15 unidentifiable objects since 2000. All have had similar characteristics but no other definition than they look like stars. What has made these objects unique to other things in the sky is either their sudden appearance and dissappearance, pulsing or flashing light sources and even their movement.  I will however will post my last sighting as I can still remember the details of what happened that night better than other times and wish to not use any more space discussing them on this post. (I promise, I will see more). ;)  It was between 1:00 am and 1:10 am when I was outside of my house staring up at the sky. It was then when I noticed something awkward in the sky south of my visual point.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The sky was as clear as it could be in this suburban neighborhood when I noticed an object glowing brighter. This object looked very much like a star, but I caught the fact that it wasn&#39;t there a few seconds or minutes before actually noticing that it was not part of the sky map that I had in my current working memory.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What kept my interest in observing it as I mentioned in the paragraph above was that this &#34;thing&#34; was glowing in slightly faster pulses than a regular star. It slightly moved vertically, came to a pause and then for some even odder reason, it looked like it dropped (or spilled) sometype of gaseus or liquid material the same color as this &#34;star&#34;.  I wish I could say it was a trail of its movement, but this stuff came out of it after it was stationed for a few fractions of a second.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This thing was reddish in color, in fact it was similar to Mars but much brighter. When this fluid or gaseus like substance spilled, I became slightly nervous thinking that it could have been a supernova.  Immediately as I heard my father coming towards the door, I called him to run out as quickly as possible to witness this thing with me.  He made it on time to see the remaining activity.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The gaseous dropping was gone, but the object remained, however the pulses began to accelerate.  As we were watching these flashing pulses, the object either began to drift away or shrink. Nevertheless, I can agree with anyone that it was fading away, and it did until there was no visual of it. We did not remove our eyes for not even five approximate seconds when this object began reappearing in the same position that it dissappeared in. The light from the object began to increase in brightness or size (or both) again. The flashes returned until it reached it&#39;s approximate original size, and seconds later it gradually began to dissappear again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This was not the first sighting I have had. This is also not the first sighting I have had with the company of a witness either.  I cannot draw any conclusions or judgements that this object was any type of spacecraft, however, this and others similar that I have witnessed hold no other place than to be anomolies of some sort, or they can be purely a perceptual construct of something entirely natural.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It is very easy to say that compared to any airplanes, helicopters, fireworks, meteors, comets, flare guns, or any other objects I have seen these sightings I&#39;ve had separate themselves from anything else I have seen that&#39;s logically explainable. This last object like the others was much higher and brighter than other areal objects for its distance.  The stationary positions and their slow movement separate them from things I am accustomed to see in the air as well.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My background is fairly simple. I am a 32 year old hispanic male. I live in the city of Carson. My hobbies are amateur radio, programming, networking, and Unix operating system hobbyst. I work as System Administrator, and a computer engineering major at Devry University.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of sighting is approximate.  PD))<n>

After about 10 minutes, it dipped a little and vanished.  It looked like a ball of bright red light.  We sighted it from the northwest corner of Southern &amp; Alma School, about 1 mile from the Bank of America Building and this object was very high in the sky.

There were scattered clouds and the moon was fully visible.  This object appeared at approximately the 3-4 o&#39;clock position relative to the moon and my sister assumed that it was the light of an oncoming plane that she was seeing until it began to perfom some very remarkable movements.  From its stationary position it rapidly decended vertically to near the horizon level and hovered.  It seemed either to be wobbling or to be flashing lights, the clouds made it difficult to tell.  The object then reversed direction to head directly upwards approximately 1/3 the distance it had initially decended then stopped again.  After a second or two the object shot off with incredible speed to the northeast before disappearing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> She had managed to reach me by cell phone during the sighting and was obviously excited and seemed certain that she had seen no ordinary aircraft.  Unfortunately the object left the area before she was able to take pictures.  Also of note is the fact that she saw a vehicle pulled over to the side of the road with a man and his child watching the object through binoculars.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I plan to contact the local FAA to see if I can get any more information.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Not like what you see when you look at mars through a telescope, but a rich, bright, red star.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It looked to be standing still, but when compared with the white stars around it, it was moving at a slow and steady pace. At about 21:14 when a plane flew over us (while well beneath the &#34;red star&#34;) it seemed to pass the object in question, but then the &#34;red star&#34; looked as if it flew away or simply fell with gravity toward the earth and faded out. It was hanging out in the southwest sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is where se saw it from the location of Dobson Ranch.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Myself, my husband, and our neighbor all saw the same episode.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Did anyone else witness this same thing?<n>

I knew at the first site that it wasn&#39;t normal. I called my mom and dad. I got a picture then I called a few friends to see it. It was a formation of 3 red lights making a triangle. Well a few minutes past and one of the lights fell from the formation like a bomb. It showed no sign of its landing. It dropped another and a few minutes later the remaining light enlarged then dissapeared like the millenium falcon going ito hyper-speed.

It was low in elevation (the passing planes were higher then it).  We pulled up to our house and called my parents out to look at it and then called my brother (we all live on the same street).  the object was in a spinning motion and kept going higher and higher in elevation.  At one point one of the red lights appeared to break off and fall back towards earth and flickered red on the way down.  This happened till all the lights were gone.

I looked back in the eye peice and followed the object with the telescope. I could not make out a shape. It flashed a white light constantly and did not change color or direction and moved from the southeast to the north northwest.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I tried to see it with my naked eye again and could not see the object.I noticed a plane to the east and could see it with my naked eye. I followed the object until it passed behind the trees. I scanned the sky for more than 2 more hours hopeing to catch sight of any thing else. I told my parents about it.

Not really big, but bright.  Then I thought it wasn&#39;t actually moving and may be a star.  I pointed it out to my husband in the passenger seat and my teenage son in the back.  Then all of a sudden it disappeared.  My husband said it was a plane that turned off its landing light, but I couldn&#39;t see anything at all in the sky although the sky wasn&#39;t bright, it didn&#39;t appear to be overcast.  OK - but closer into town and now in morning rush hour traffic, directly ahead of me I noticed the same light appear into view, and I thought a plane was banking and caught sunlight, but again the light disappeared, it was there one second, then gone.  Bright blue sky with no trace of any object to be seen - same as before.  Further, a couple of months ago, early one morning, we noticed a bright light travelling along.  And while, it may have been an airplane reflecting light, it was quite bright and looked more like a meteor, except that it was definitely in the atmosphere.  Strangest airplane sightings in all my years of noticing airplanes!  No one will believe this stuff until they land and are on network tv, I guess.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous.  PD))<n>

All I could make out was the shadow off the upper half of a figure and a blue light that filled my room.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I tried to scream but nothing came out.  I thought if I banged on the walls then someone would come but I found that I couldn&#39;t move.  I broke in a sweat and was scarred to death.  Then I felt as if I had either awoken again or just returned to my bed because my clock said 3:15.  I immediately jumped out of bed and turned on the light and tv.  I didn&#39;t sleep the rest of the night and wouldn&#39;t sleep without the tv or light on for weeks.<n>

At the time there were only two crafts that I saw.  They would fly in this odd pattern, one craft would would fly above the other one, the bottom one would stop and the top would stop.  Then the top craft would fly off.  After viewing this I thought they were some type of military aircraft and went inside.  I saw my brother going outside to look when he called me to come out to see that there were many more crafts, a total of 6.  All of the crafts had flashing lights that were red, blue, and white. I found there was no sound from them at all.  One flew directly over me and I saw it was a diamond shape and the red lights were on each tip.  They couldn&#39;t have been airplanes because they were flying so close together at times.  After the crafts would fly in seperate paths, they would all come together into a triangle formation then split back up again.  Some of the crafts would be flying at the same speed of the others, and then speed up very very fast.  I went insde and got a digital camera to try to take a picture, but when I tryed to put them on my computer, it said there were no pictures on the camera.  I found this to be very strange because that never happened to me before.  The crafts continued to fly for 30 minutes before they all disappeared.  On the night my brother and I saw them, it was a very clear night, there were no clouds at all.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain semi-anonymous.  PD))<n>

It was about 100&#39; high and 50&#39; wide, with rays, lighting up an area about 1/4 sq. mile in the rural area.  The object was stopped about 200&#39; below a 300&#39; high radio tower.  The object itself was seen by only the one observer, the light from it was seen by 2 other observers who were about 1/2 mi. away on the other side of a hill who had been watching the tower at time. They were on the opposite side of the object and could only see the light, not the actual object.  The reporter had to stop watching it for about 15 seconds and when he looked back, it was higher in the air, nearly out of side and pulsating and flashing at about the rate of a heartbeat, and then it disappeared from sight.  The light was so bright it burnt the observer&#39;s eyes like the light from a welding arc.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((ADDENDUM FROM WITNESS))<n> <n><n> <n><n> As A follow up of my report of 1-27-05 from corsica, The u f o left in the direction of State College which is about 100 mi. away<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((END))<n>

Thought that it was a plane, but didn&#39;t see the typical navigation lights or hear the engine(s). I got into the car and drove. I was on 44th Street and as I approached Indian School, I saw it again, moving in the same direction, very slowly. Must be a plane, I thought to myself. Trying to navigate, but periodically looking towards the sky, I could still see it as I approached Camelback Road. I watched it as it passed near a plane with the standard navigation and strobe lights. It continued the same heading as we approached the area where 44th Street curves to the east and changes into McDonald. Turned left on Tatum and I couldn&#39;t see it anymore. As I drove deeper into Paradise Valley, passed Lincoln, I saw it again, same or similar light, blinking and moving slowly. I saw this thing in the sky until I reached my home on the otherside of the Paradise Valley Mall. After I parked my car, I couldn&#39;t see it anymore.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

My attention was suddenly drawn to an object up at a very high altitude and directly overhead emitting a brilliant solid white light beam in front of it. The light was in a reversed triangular pattern coming from the object. A commercial aircraft started to approach the area and immediately the brilliant solid white light went out and all I could see was a very faint white light moving quickly forward towards the approaching commercial aircraft. It actually passed the commercial aircraft but at a much higher altitude. I finally lost sight of the object as it was traveling away faster and in the opposite direction of the approaching commercial aircraft. I had a chance to compare object to the commercial aircraft as they passed and noted no flashing lights and no sound. I did hear the sound from the commercial aircraft and of course it had flashing lights. I suspect object may have been a military aircraft but I&#39;m not sure.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

But not dense enough to obscure vision.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Before entering the house, I decided to look at the moon. I laid eyes with it for several minutes, it wasnt very cold outside, and I wasnt in a hurry to get back inside.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then I noticed the most amazing thing, I have ever seen in my life.   A Ufo, Literally in the shape of a U. It was 90% invisible. All i saw was the distinct outline of the craft which had three opaque whitish spots at the rear(lights?), within this outline was sky. It traveled fairly slow and it approached the moon. The light of the moon revealed the entire craft. I was astonished.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There WERE clouds(dark purple hue), but,the craft was definatley lower than the clouds, there were large breaks in the clouds, showing clear night sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The outline, appeared Bigger than the full moon, which means it was fairly low in the sky.  The glow of the moon amplifed the image of the craft and actually revealed its outline further to about 80% visible. The U shaped crafts direction was SouthWest. From the moment I saw the craft, which was about 3 inches from the moon(my first visual). It took about 10 seconds for it to pass the moon, at which point I could no longer see it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After I lost visual of the silent U shaped craft, I proceeded toward the door to my house, before walking in, I clearly heard a FAST jet flying what sounded west. The jet sounded small, but DEFINATLEY a jet. I live over a major flight path intersection, I hear the differences in all aircraft engines. The noise was a shhhrrreeeeeaaaar engine, with minor crackles. Midtoned, unlike the deep constant currrrrrrghghg jumbo jet engine    (hard to translate sound into word form) definatly not a prop plane..<n> <n><n> <n><n> I then walked in the house and concluded my evening.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have submitted a gif animation to recreate the object, to visualize its translucence ufo 417am 1-27-05.gif<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.

There were a few &#34;whisps&#34; of cloud along the edges of the straight lines, but it was definitely a rectangle. There were other clouds in the sky, the thick fluffy kind, but the rectangle shaped cloud remained stationary, high above the exit. As I continued driving I would look up through my windshield and watch this rectangular cloud, trying to figure out how in the world the winds could fashion a perfect rectangle. There was light reflecting off of the bottom of the cloud, I believe the reflection were all of the lights from the exchange below. I&#39;m not saying it was or was not a UFO but it was a perfectly shapped rectangular cloud.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

He drove for several minutes  noting that the object appeared to be hovering as it drew closer. He arrived at a point where he could safely pull off the interstate and did so, exited his truck and watched the strange object . He described the object as a dark triangular object, backlit by the bright sky(nearly full moon) with three large reddish orange lights affixed to each point. The object was hovering at some 45 degrees to his position and was the relative size of a golfball at arm&#39;s length. He described the object as slowly rotating but making no other discernable movements. After several more minutes, the object simply disappeared.

Only certain dots would move, some moved suddenly quite quickly.  Orginaly looked like stars.  three dots were about three times as large as the rest.  Originally they were in one long climbing line, but they grouped together.  A large stratus cloud had just recently passed by, moveing quite slowly to the south, (I was positioned to the east of the city the dots were just south of the city, almost above it.)  Behind the white dots was blue sky (sun was almost setting.  We suspect that they might have been ballons but they were floating in class B airspace.  If ballons floating at 2000 ft AGL (above ground level)  Temp at ground level aprox. 22 degrees F.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Initially, it could be described as a bright star but almost immediately, the intensity increased exponentially.  Then it faded to a point no brighter than the background stars and traveled west until it completely disappeared.  It moved at the same velocity of a commercial jet but there were no beacons, strobes, or navigational lights of any kind.  My first thought was that I had witnessed a meteor straight-on... it became extremely bright and then &#34;burned out.&#34;  But that would not explain the turn to the west and then the disappearance.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The second object was exactly like the first but was never bright.  It followed a similar path again with no lighting that would identify it as a commercial aircraft.  There were aircraft in the sky and it was easy to differentiate.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

There were minimal clouds and a full moon. The moon was on the horizon towards the North-East of the sky and the satellite was approximately five vertical fists-lengths above the moon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The satellite was flying North to South at what appeared to be a normal speed compared to other satellites I had seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> All of a sudden the satellite stopped and started flying upwards into the sky, all six of us were amazed and convinced ourselves that it was the international space-station and that it was just changing direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> But then it stopped again, and then rapidly increased its speed, flying in zig-zag and circle patterns. It then appeared to dim and brighten every few seconds, i suspected that it was flying up and down, altering its altitude.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I managed to get two photographs taken with my digital camera, in night mode so the shutter was left open for a second or two. and also 8 seconds of video footage with the same camera. The object can be seen moving in a circular pattern in both the time lapse pics, and the video. However a skeptic could explain them as me moving the camera around while filming a bright star. I think not.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I went inside to call a friend and when i returned it had disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The object fell approximately at a 35-40 degree angle for about 2 seconds then exploded/fragmented and the sparks or fragments were of a green color.  It reminded me of an exploding fireworks.  The location in the night sky was to the N.E. of the place where the sun set.  In my windshield as I drove north it was in the top left part of my windshield.  There was a star in the sky nearest the horizon and the &#34;falling star&#34; was located between the star and the horizon.  I am guessing that what I saw was a fragmenting meteorite that hit the earth’s atmosphere.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke via telephone with this witness, and she seemed quite credible to us, and seemed to be a very objective, factual observer.

It was already dark. All of a sudden, a craft moved across a field, above the tree leve. It was shaped like an elongated torpedo. My friend, who&#39;s brother is in the air force, said he thought it might be a fighter plane, but when the object turned and we saw it in profile we realised it was no plane. It was a bluish black, very dark, and not all that far away from us. About as far as you see a plane thats comming in to land, in fact. Of course, we were shaken. The object made a whirring noise, like that of a chopper but not as mechanical. A purr, almost. The object had greyish lights where you may see cockpit windows on a regular plane. Also, they wern&#39;t so much eminating light as just glowing. There lights lit up, and then the craft disapeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I called out my room mates boyfriend to see waht I was looking at. We both watched two smaller fireballs flash brightly then both fell, one on each side of the craft. To me it looked like when the space shuttle takes off and then drops its solid fuel boosters. The third trail of fire just kept going and faded off into the night sky. I figuree it was some form of rocket, but is was after midnight, and odd time to do any missile testing, and what kind of military craft drops two rockets off, and where could this have taken off from...???  DO you know...have any other people that saw the same thing? idf you could shed a little light on what I may have seen, please let me know. Thanks<n>

I turned to get a better view and I saw a very large, bright green light, dropping from the sky, to the southeast.  I wished I had noticed it sooner for it dissapeared from my view rather quickly, behind a tall tree. I estimate the distance to have been about 5 miles away or further. It appeared to be right over Fort Sam Houston but, could have been farther. It would be difficult for me to estimate the heigth at which I first saw the object. From my vantage point, it appeared to be at least as high as the passenger jets in the area when they are making their last bank before landing at SA Int. Airport.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Again, it was very large and bright, green in color and was dropping straight down from the sky. I expected to hear an explosion (crash) as it neared the ground but nothing! As for shape, all I can say is that it was a large light. Anybody else see this thing?<n>

At a little after 8 p.m. we were on Route 60 between Lake Wales and Vero Beach, Florida.  We were getting close to a Camp Retreat known as River Ranch.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My wife called my attention to a huge lighted object in the sky to her right.  I looked and saw what appeared to be a large formation of equal size light. The lights were steady and not blinking.  It looked like the top of a very wide oil refinary tank with lights mounted around the top edge of the tank. In fact, I thought it might be a very large tower of some sorts, but I ruled that out when I could not see any indication of anything stretching from the formation of lights to the ground, that it was actually a huge object in the night sky.  About that time a brilliant flare-like light burst in the sky closer to us and between us and the lighted object. A second burst or explosion of bright light came out from that first burst. The light bursts resembled huge Roman Candle balls, but were as bright as flares and had no trail of lights or sparks, indicating they had come up from the ground. I drove on watching the formation of lights and finally pulled over to get my binoculars out of the trunk. The huge object was still in the sky and I saw the lights on it through my binoculars and the naked eye, but could not get the binoculars focused into one image.  I never did see any kind of craft, but only the formation of lights which seemed to curve around the edge of something.  It was so huge that it looked to me like about a 10 to 15-story building, with one light cut on on each floor, lying on its side up in the sky.  While I fiddled with the binoculars, the lighted object moved rapidly away from me towards the west or southwest and disappeared over the horizon.  When I stopped to get my binoculars out of the trunk, my wife saw more of the bursts of light -flare-type lights we had seen when we first spotted it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When my wife first called my attention to the big lighted object, there also seemed to be scores of smaller independant lights jumping around the sky in the vicinity of the big object.  A few of these smaller lights had blinking lights and were probably aircraft, but the &#34;jumping&#34; smaller lights were puzzling.  There was a full moon out.  I wanted to think this was a lineup of small planes, or helicopters, but there were no blinking lights and the perfect formation of the lights on the big object, that all moved as one, prevented it from being any of these. My wife will separately enter her version of what she saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((COMMENT FROM READER))<n> <n><n> <n><n> Likely explaination for sighting in Lake Wales  1/24/2005<n> <n><n> <n><n> Referencing the sighting reported on this date, I am very familiar with this area.

At this same time, I saw bright lights resembling a flare ( about a half-dozen) that sparked and then were gone.  In addition there were little lights flashing all over that area that reminded me of grasshoppers jumping from place to place. We tried to pull off of the highway in a safe place, finally found one and my husband got out the binoculars and by the time he got them adjusted, the disk-like object was gone.  However, I still saw the bright lights (a second time), and the little lights dancing around like grasshoppers were all over the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Wife&#39;s report of same event reported by husband.

It was traveling faster than either of the planes from east to west, it disappeared as fast as it had appeared.  While looking up, trying to determine if this was another plane, it reappeared sightly to the north of the last location I had seen it in and was now traveling south to north, again, it was only visible for about 10 seconds.

We went into the house and got the binoculars and camera.<n> <n><n> <n><n> While looking through the binoculars you could see multi-colored lights, red, blue, yellow, green, white and what appeared to be dark colored windows in the sides of the objects.  Each object was a different shape and size, with very bizarre shapes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We took several photographs of these objects that finally moved toward the West and stopped again near a giant white light that looked like a 3/4  odd shaped moon.  We also photographed this white light and continued to watch the colored objects moving around - then all of a sudden they all disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We still have these photos of the objects but they have to be magnified on the computer to see the windows and all of the colored lights.  Someone may want to look at these photos and possibly blow them up for a closer examination.<n>

As we were approaching the main road we were startled to see 3 lights.Two of the lights seemed to be in back of the trees,and one seemed to be traveling in front of the trees.We guessed them to be about 100 feet in the air.My husband thought it was some kind of search light.We continued driving north to try and get a better look.We continued 1-4th mi. and then got out of the car to get a better look.We observed 4 glowing lights which would the go to the center and become one.They kept repeating this pattern.We could see nothing above or below this object.We live in a rural area ,approximately 11 mi. s.e. of the city. This seemed to be hovering over a field. The object seemed to be moving north so we continued to follow.We once more got out of the car,where it seemed to hovering near the railroad tracks. We watched as it kept repeating the same pattern for approximatly 10 minutes. My husband and I were shocked and excited ,it was like nothing we had ever seen before. The object seemed to be moving again so we continued to the next cross street and followed for approx.1/2 miles where it hovered again. This object kept repeating the pattern and finally became one light and disappeared into thin air.The back drop this time was all trees over a field.We observed no other color other than the white light.My husband and I are still in shock. We both feel we witnessed a UFO.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with these two witnesses, and we found them to be exceptionally serious-minded, and credible.  At first, we thought that they might have been witness to circling advertising lights, but they believe that not to be the case.  We do not know what they witnessed.  PD))<n>

HE ,HIS WIFE AND THERE TWO DAUGHTERS (16 AND 10 YEARS OLD) WERE IN THE CAR. AS I STARTED TO GET IN MY BROTHER WAS GETTING OUT. HE DREW MY ATTENTION TO THE EAST. WHERE WE ALL SAW 4 BRIGHT DOTS IN THE SKY THROUGH AN OPENING IN THE CLOUDS. THEY PASSED THROUGH THE OPENING AND WENT BEHIND ANOTHER CLOUD.THEN WE SAW A HALF CIRCLE FORMATION OF DOTS FOLLOWED BY A DIAMOND SHAPE FORMATION OF DOTS. WE CONTINUED TO WACTCH AS VARIOUS PATTERNS, AND RANDOM DOTS MOVED ACROSS THE OPENINGS IN THE CLOUDS. THIS CONTINUED FOR 10 TO 12 MINUTES. WE FINALLY GOT INTO THE CAR AND DROVE 20 MILES TO A RESTURANT. WHEN WE ARRIVED AND I GOT OUT OF THE CAR THERE WAS A SMALL OPENING IN THE CLOUDS.I WATCHED IT FOR ABOUT 10 SECONDS AND SAW 2 ADDITIONAL DOTS PASS ACROSS THE OPENING. THESE DOTS WER ALUMINATED BY THE SUN ONE  AND A HALF HOURS AFTER SUNSET SO THEY HAD TO BE EXTREMELY HIGH AND WERE MOVING ROUGHLY EAST TO WEST AT ABOUT 5 TIMES AS FAST AS A JET PLANE MOVES ACROSS THE SKY.I MADE INQUIRES THE NEXT DAY AND WAS DISAPPOINTED TO FIND THAT THE TV STATIONS SAID THEY HADNT HAD ANY REPORTS<n>

1/21/05 19:00|Surf City|NC|Changing|1 minute|Pulsing multicolored lights which appeared to outline a relatively large craft or crafts at low altitude at Topsail Island.|1/27/05|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/041/S41597.html|71|ndxe200501| Pulsing multicolored lights which appeared to outline a relatively large craft or crafts at low altitude at Topsail Island.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Driving home from work, an object was initially sighted approximately 1 mile south of the Surf City stoplight. Since we are in a MOA, I initially dismissed it as a military craft, and thought it might be an osprey  ((Note:  A type of VTOL aircraft.  PD)) since the lighting was unfamiliar and quite peculiar. I stopped along the road and noted that it was silent and in my estimation within 300 feet of the ground. Assuming military origin (however quite puzzeled at the lack of sound and the unfamiliar flashing light pattern), I proceeded home a couple miles southward and as I was unloading groceries noted with suprise that it had appeared over the ocean in front of our home. I immediately retrieved my 4.0 megapixel ditigal camera and took a number of pictures as it moved away. Visually, I noted pulsing very bright red, white, yellow, (green?) and occasionally blue lights. I was unable to discern a readily discernable pattern but got a sense that there was some sort of regularity to the pulsations. It was moving to the northwest at what I would estimate to be approximately 30 to 40 knots. I judged it to be one to two hundred feet across. The vertical dimension was unclear except that it appeared less thatn the horizontal. Within a minute or two, it disappeared behind (below) the island&#39;s northern horizon of trees and houses (estimating) approximately 0.5 to 1 mile distant. The most interesting aspect of this sighting was that the recorded images had a characteristic luminous multi-directional, sinous, plasma-like blurred trail which we did not visualize. Also, blue objects appeared and disappeared in what seemed to be random intervals in proximity to the object, at variable distance and position. Low clouds were present and no outline could be discerned. The images speak for themselves.<n>

My father was watching TV in the living room, and all of a sudden he shouted out for me to come quickly! Running into the living room, and following him out the door and down the steps, we saw a star-like object. (Estimate 5000 ft. up. Cloud cover was little to none.) This object was coming in from the northeast and heading southwest. It had a series of lights in the center of it&#39;s star shaped feature. Again no noise! My father and me do not believe it to be the space station because it was too low to the ground, and my father said that he never has seen lights like that on conventional aircraft.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I stoped to get out and strech and look at a map. Around 200 ft. above me a ship flew right over me and at the same time my car turned off. Once my car turned off i saw the shape of the ship. For about 5 min i saw it fly around and then it went into a hiper space glow thing. My car turned back on and i got back in my car and turned around right away and drove right back to the interstate.

At first I thought it was a plane, but I felt to keep looking at it. It was moving slowly from west to east. It was slow moving. Too slow to be a plane. All of a sudden it seemed to be changing shape! Im thinking maybe it could be cloud shadows hitting it. But, I distincly saw what looked like it morphiong into to balls of white and as they did so it looked like they went around each other and then it would go back to being one ball of white. I focused on it and having a faith in God, I prayed for God to stop it. Then it stopped! and Hovered! Then it would move. then stop again. Then it continued on nonchalantly. This was about 3 miles away from me at about 55 degrees above horizon looking north. A coworker came out and i told him to look at it, and he was like what the heck is it. I told him to watch it while i got a camera. I ran and got the digital camera. Then i came out and took a picture of it.  THE CAMERA DIDNT EVEN REGISTER THAT I HAD TAKEN A PICTURE!!! It made all the blinking sounds it would normally...but no picture! So we sat watching it until it disappeared into clouds far off. I can also recal having a strange pain in my sinuses or nostrils as well.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain semi-anonymous.  PD))<n>

It looked as if it was moving slowly, so I kept an eye on it to determine if it was moving.  Once I was sure it was moving I was thinking it was a plane or a helicopter.  There was no noise as would be normal with a aircraft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I then noticed that it was moving way to slow for a plane.  I kept watching as it started to move closer and closer to my direction.  It went into some trees and shone brighter then before and then it just vanished.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first I was thinking it was behind the trees so I kept waiting for it to clear and come into view again. It never came back into view and I even went to higher ground and couldn&#39;t see it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After another 10 mins or so of looking I gave up and decided it had just vanished. This is the second time I have seen strange lights in the area.  I am looking for similar reports from my area.  Thanks<n>

I turned to look at everyone elses speechless faces, looked back and it was within 100 yards from us above the treetops hovering near large colonial homes going down beyond the treetops where there is a golf course. It looked like a large minivan or ambulance without wheels or wings, with an ambulance-like door on the back of the object. It looked as if the door was lit-up, or glowing.

They formed a line that was straight on the bottom and arched on top. The lights were higher then tree level but lower then we see a plane fly, they did not appear to be moving.  As we were puzzling what the lights could be, they just disappeared. Then about 15 seconds or so later they were back again.

Looking tpo the South  I saw what looked like a light that flashed many different colors. It appeared to be several miles away, and thot it to be an airplane or star. Being very familiar with astronomy and also seeing the heavy cloud cover, horizen to horizen, I knew this was interesting. As I watched it more closely I realized that it was wobbling up and down, side to side in small but definate movements. Also noticed it wasnt moving in a direction. It was stationary aside from the wobbling movements. This event lasted for at least two cigarettes, and I smoke 100&#39;s, and a few mins longer than that. I estimate 20 mins. or so. The light continued to flash many colors this entire time, and just before it vanished I noticed a shift in its position a couple of degrees against the tree line I was using as a reference. I&#39;m very familiar with how things look in the sky at night and I have never seen anything behave like this before.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Report is not inconsistent with a sighting of the star, Sirius.

I live in the NW area of Ocala FL and the lights were clearly west and south of my house. Honestly, I feel a little silly telling this, but it was quite amazing to witness: The four white circles flew in bizarre, clearly geometric patterns, seeming to &#34;smack&#34; together and become one larger ball of light and immediately disperse into four separat balls of light. It was like a dance--a square dance, one might say--where the four couples turn and return.  I couldn&#39;t believe my eyes and looked for a ground source of light, but there was none. The sky was clear, and it was easy to see them.  They flew in ways no normal craft can fly, faster than I can describe, stopping cold and turning back over and over again. Another metaphor I might use to describe this is to picture them as large white billiard balls smacking together and breaking into varied patterns, stopping, turning back and smacking together again.  There was absolutely no sound at all, just light. I watched them for about half an hour.  I realized I should perhaps be frightened of this odd sighting, but curiously, I felt elated; they seemed joyful somehow. I&#39;m sure it&#39;s ridiculous, but I sensed they were flying this dancing pattern just for fun.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Possible sighting of advertising lights?

They did not move, remaining stationary for approx. 45 seconds, and then faded away, as if turning down a dimmer switch.  A few seconds later, the same formation appeared in the opposite quadrent of the sky, remained lit for about 45 seconds, and again dimmed.  The distance between the two points would have been far too great to have been traversed by a conventional craft.  Shortly after the second appearence, a formation of 8 US figther jets approached the area where the lights had appeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
1/19/05 18:30|Jacksonville|FL|Sphere|2 hours|These are accounts of several personal UFO and 'other' experiences.|5/15/06|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/050/S50208.html|88|ndxe200501| These are accounts of several personal UFO and &#39;other&#39; experiences.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 1) The January 2005 UFO sighting, Jacksonville, Florida:  Shortly after dusk on the evening of January 19, 2005, I was closing the curtains in the band room of my West Jacksonville home.  While doing so, I noticed a very bright light in the sky, larger than a star, which was changing colors, hovering and moving slightly up and down, which was located in the ESE sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I called for my live in boyfriend to observe as well, in which he did.  We watched the object for a good ten to fifteen minutes, as it appeared to hover, and make only slight movement in the sky, mostly in an up and down motion, but sometimes slightly back and forth.  The object appeared to grow brighter and dimmer at times, but did not seem to be &#39;traveling,&#39; like a plane.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In the center of this object, stretching horizontally across the object, the lights emanating from the object changed colors frequently, and one could clearly distinguish that this was not a star or planet.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My boyfriend and myself both noted that this was not a star or planet from it&#39;s slight movements, and the line of lights which changed colors, and noted that it was not like any aircraft which we normally see from where we live, because of it&#39;s movements, and sometimes the lack thereof.  We heard no noise from this object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I began cooking supper, but occasionally checked back on the object, which was there several times when I checked on it, but eventually disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> One interesting note, in another account of the January sighting, the person witnessed the UFO on the 15th, we witnessed it on the 19th, however, the witness was on HWY 301, which is not far from our house.  We live on Cahoon Rd, off Normandy Blvd, which runs into, and ends at HWY 301.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Normandy Blvd., Jacksonville, FL 32205  This incident can be verified by my current boyfriend of 4 years.  I did notice several conventional style aircraft flying in the same area that night which may be able to substantiate this story further.<n> <n><n> <n><n> .....................................................................................<n> <n><n> <n><n> 2) The electrical assault incidence:  This may sound very strange, but on my word of honor, this is the truth, and did in fact happen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In 2003 or 2004, my memory escapes me as to which year exactly in which this occurred but, one afternoon I was washing dishes at the same address as the above incidence, and I was alone in my house, as my live in boyfriend was at work.  I became aware of a strange frequency which I could hear which seemed especially &#39;targeted&#39; at my right ear.  This frequency was a lower pitch than the frequencies I normally pick up on from time to time, and seemed strange that it seemed &#39;targeted&#39; at the right ear, instead of being heard by both of them.  What was also strange was this frequency was also felt as well as heard.  As I experienced this frequency, I also experienced a strange sensation in my head, almost like a slight stun to my brain.  Though I found this to be quite odd, it did not become unpleasant until a few seconds later when from this frequency I suddenly experienced what felt like an electric shock to the upper right side of my head, which felt like I was being zapped by a stun gun!  This immediately brought me to my knees!  After about a minute, I returned to my feet, (quite startled, scared and somewhat pissed off), only for this to happen once again! Immediately after somewhat regaining my composure, I grabbed a pistol and searched the house for an intruder and a possible explanation, but I discovered that I was indeed alone in the house, with the doors locked.  I had never before experienced anything like this, nor have I since, however I am now quite frightened when I hear frequencies.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I debated with myself the idea of calling up the military to see if they were doing some kind of military weapons testing using frequencies, but declined to do so, as it dawned on me that they probably would not tell me the truth, and them knowing I would sue them for testing on me, I figured that it probably might not be a good idea, as they could (and would), probably kill me by zapping me, if they chose to, rather than being sued, if this occurrence was a result of military testing.  I also pondered that this may be UFO related, as I have had &#39;other&#39; strange occurrences happen in my lifetime, which I suspect could be UFO related.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have no answers or explanation as to who is responsible, or why this incidence happened, but would truly would like the answer to this.  Have you ever come across any instances like this in your research?  If so, would you please share them with me?  Any input on this is greatly appreciated! .....................................................................................<n> <n><n> <n><n> 3) Time loss incidence #2:  In early spring of 1997, I was traveling from Louisville KY, on my way home to Jacksonville, (I lived on the Northside of Jacksonville at this time, but was spending time with my boyfriend at the time, who was a mechanical engineer working in Louisville, while my best friend stayed at my house, held down the fort and cared for my dogs.  One of my dogs was in the pound, and I went home to rescue my dog.) I had stopped at the Pio-Ono (GA) exit on 1-75 late at night, to get gas and coffee, before leaving the parking lot, I put in a fresh 90 minute cassette tape, of some recorded music, (45 minutes per side), which had CCR on one side and Aretha Franklin on the other.  The tape was rewound before I left the parking lot, as I used 90 minute cassette tapes to help &#39;time&#39; the trip.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I got back on I-75 headed south, (I was quite sure of this), and was on my way down the road.  In what seemed like just a few minutes back on the road, I went to take a sip of my coffee, and it was cold, at this point I knew something was weird, as I had just bought the coffee moments before, and it was quite hot at the time, and I take creamer in my coffee, and powdered creamer does NOT dissolve in less than hot liquid, yet the creamer in my coffee was perfectly dissolved.  I then became suddenly aware that the tape I was listening to was well into the other (Aretha) side, and I had not changed it! I kept going on my journey to spite the strange occurrence, pondering an explanation.  A few moments later, I discovered that I was not traveling South as I was sure that I was, but was headed North instead.  (I was starting to weird out at this point).<n> <n><n> <n><n> I got off the next exit, and turned around, and started heading South again.  It took me about 20 minutes to reach the Pio-Ono exit once again, and it was at this point, that I understood that I had experienced another time loss episode.  I later told my best friend, and boyfriend (at the time), about the incident, which you can contact both of them concerning this.<n> <n><n> <n><n> .....................................................................................<n> <n><n> <n><n> 1996 UFO sighting, Jacksonville FL:  One evening while sitting home enjoying an evening alone, (no boyfriend in this incidence LOL, and this event took place at my Northside Jacksonville residence, the same one as the incidence above), I was lounging on the couch, listening to music, and I happened to look out the window at the night sky, and noticed an object fitting the exact same description of the UFO in the #1 sighting in the sky.  I observed it just hovering there, moving slightly up and down and sometimes back and forth growing sometimes dimmer, sometimes brighter, and changing colors.  I realized it had to be a UFO.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I watched this object for a good half an hour, when my roomate/friend came home, and I told him about the object.  He checked it out, agreed that it was probably a UFO, and after a while, he went to his room, where I did not see him for the rest of the night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I watched the object for a while longer, and suddenly it just disappeared like a light being turned off! This can be verified by my ex-roomate.<n> <n><n> <n><n> .....................................................................................<n> <n><n> <n><n> Time loss incident #1, Jacksonville, FL, 1994:  About 10:45 PM, I went to the convenience store to fetch a soda and a pack of cigarettes before the store closed at 11.  I lived on Deerfield Lane in the sticks off of Starrat Road in North Jacksonville.  This was the only store for about 5 miles, and wanted to get there before the store closed.  This store was only about one half mile away from my home, so the entire trip usually only took 15 minutes tops, even if I stopped to chat with someone, or their was a line, etc.  It was the norm for me to put off making the trip until the last minute, because at the time I was writing a book, and was very much caught up in the process of doing so.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I left, my boyfriend Brian, was sitting in the recliner watching TV.  This too was the norm, as he would retire for the evening customarily after I made my evening run to the store.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I went to the store, got my RC and smokes, and headed back home as usual.  When I returned home, the lights in the house were dimmed, and the TV was off.  I thought this very strange.  I started feeling quite spooked for some strange reason, which is NOT the norm for me.  I walked in the door, and there was a very pissed off Brian waiting for me interrogating me as to where I had been!  Of course, I thought he had lost his mind, as I had just been to the store and back as usual.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I asked Brian if he had lost his mind, and explained/protested that I had just been to the store and back as usual.  This infuriated him, as he said that I had not been just to the store, that the store has been closed for hours, he began ranting and raving about how he went up there looking for me, I was nowhere to be found, how he called my best friend, blah, blah, blah, and pointed at the clock and said it doesn&#39;t take 3 hours to go a half a mile to the store, blah, blah, blah, and proceeded to have a conniption!  I looked at the clock and it was after 2 AM!  I then thought that he had lost his mind, AND was picking a fight with me, that he had moved the hands on the clock.<n> <n><n> <n><n> He then tells me to call my best friend Brenda, and let her know I got home safely.  I did.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I found out then that Brian had not moved the hands on the clock, that in fact I had a strange and unexplainable time loss eppisode.  (I&#39;m still not convinced that Brian had not lost his mind though, from the conniption he threw.  I then nick named Brian, &#34;Flyin&#39; Brian&#34;.  LOL.)  Brenda had been very worried about me, as was Brian.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I could not explain what had happened during that time, but after that, everytime I had to travel down that stretch of road between the convenience store and home, I was terrified, though I could not offer any logical explanation as to why! Shortly after that, I began having &#34;nightmares&#34; in which I could swear I was awake, and these things were happening to me.  I would pinch and even slap myself to make sure I was not dreaming but....<n> <n><n> <n><n> I would &#39;dream&#39; that I would be awakened by a presence in the room.  I would get up, look around and sometimes there would be typical greys, sometimes no &#39;seen&#39; being was there, but a presence was felt none the less.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I would try to wake up (Flyin&#39;) Brian, but never could wake him up when this happened.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In this dream, I would wake up, and get up and look out the bedroom window into the field out back which was covered in blackberry briars, and sandy Florida soil, with dips in it, where it was not exactly driveable, and see lights like 8 or ten vehicles lined up outside, complete with dust and sand flying up, in this field.  I could swear that I was awake, but apparently this was a dream, because the next day when I would inspect the field where the lights were, no vehicle tracks were apparent, nor were the blackberry thickets matted down.  This was a fairly regular occurrence.  And like I said, the field was not exactly drivable.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Brian and I broke up not long after that, and to this day, I refuse to go down that stretch of road.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This incidence can be verified by my ex-boyfriend Brian, and ex-best friend Brenda as well.<n> <n><n> <n><n> .....................................................................................<n> <n><n> <n><n> Fall 1986, UFO sighting, New Bern, NC:  One evening in the Fall of 1986, I went country cruising with a friend and coworker and we decided to take a break from riding, and parked in the Croatan State Park just East of New Bern, NC, and not far from Cherry Point Marine base.  Yes, we had parked to smoke a joint, as hey, we were in our mid-twenties at the time, and to just talk.  (I am now in my mid-fourties, and no longer smoke weed.) As we were sitting in my friend&#39;s truck smoking the tater and chatting, we noticed an object, that again matches the description and maneuvers of the other UFO&#39;s in the above instances.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Both of us, having lived in the area for quite some time were quite aware of the aircraft, military and otherwise, which flew regularly over the area.  This was NOT the normal aircraft which we were accustomed to seeing, and no, the pot was not especially spectacular either.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The next day, there were articles in the paper about a rash of UFO sightings seen across the US and the world.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This can be substanciated by my friend.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About 6 months, maybe less before this incidence, my mother told me in the strictest of confidence, and after much prying as to what was bothering her, that she was hearing &#39;signals&#39; one night, kind of like when one hears frequencies, only in something like Morse Code.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My mother lived directly across the street from me, and I did not hear them.  My mother never drank or smoked a tater in her life, didn&#39;t take so much as an aspirin, and was a very honest, Christian woman.<n> <n><n> <n><n> .....................................................................................<n> <n><n> <n><n> Fall of 1978 UFO sighting, Hendersonville, NC:  About 2 weeks before I was to be married, my mother and I were sitting up discussing &#34;if I was sure I really wanted to get married or not&#34; mother and daughter speech.  It was a pleasant night, and we were sitting on the couch with the lights off, and the windows open to her 2nd floor apartment.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Mom alerted me to check out the object in the sky.  The object, again matching the same characteristics and maneuvers as the ones in the accounts stated above, only with the slight difference, that there was one large one, and three other smaller vessels which moved about in the sky around the larger one.  They would move in directions that clearly differentiated them from any aircraft we had ever encountered or knew of, and would change colors in tandem with the larger craft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Sometimes these vessels would hover in a triangular pattern around the main vessel, and at times zig-zagged about, or go straight up and down.  We watched these crafts for about 25 minutes, until all of a sudden they took off at tremendous speeds.  We knew from the speed they were traveling, that these had to be UFO&#39;s.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Unfortunately, my mother is no longer with us to substantiate this story, she died in early 1987 of a rare disease, sideroblastic anemia.  My ex-husband however, can substantiate that Mom and I told him about the incident.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Near Southern Cross and Big Dipper.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Okay, me and my dad were on my balcony, watching for shooting stars, when a light starts to travel counter clockwise across the sky, above the bay. We think it could just be a satellite, but dad points out that it&#39;s going the wrong way. We watch it for a few minutes, when we notice the same size white light, (constant, un-blinking.)start to cross the sky, clockwise, toward the other light at a tangent. We watch as they encounter a very, very light cloud, and neither appear on the other sides.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After a few minutes, a blinking white light appears up and to our rights, it has a constant blinking pattern as it travels across the sky. It turns at one point, and heads down past the southern cross. And then it vanishes.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I tried to enhance the picture I could see a larger mushroom shape. A strange light to the far left and a tiny dark spot to the right. It sure looks like a UFO.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

1/18/05 06:20|Mission Viejo|CA|Sphere|30 seconds|Extremely bright object in the eastern sky in southern O.C. moving very slowly.  ((NUFORC Note:  Possible contrail??  PD))|1/27/05|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/041/S41571.html|93|ndxe200501| Extremely bright object in the eastern sky in southern O.C. moving very slowly that suddenly lost its luminance and disappeared<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;m not sure if what I saw fits the true definition of a U.F.O. It was extremely bright, like a star or a planet. I frequently look out to the south (southeast) in the early morning to gaze at what I believe is Venus or some other planet, because it is extremely bright relative to the other stars. This object that I saw on the 18th was due east and roughly 30 degrees above the horizon It appeared to be slightly moving, although now I can&#39;t recall the exact direction. It&#39;s motion was unspectacular. It travelled neither far, nor fast and it&#39;s movement wasn&#39;t particularly perceptible. The strange thing is that it looked like a very bright star/planet, and I&#39;ve never seen a star that bright in that location before, and to the best of my knowledge there shouldn&#39;t be one at that location. After staring at it for about 30 seconds it just went dim and disappeared. Now it is true that the sun was beginning to rise, but it had not come up over the horizon. Also there were plenty of other stars in various locations relative to the object in question that were still visible, and their brightness only seemed to dim gradually as I continued to look outside. They&#39;ve never just went dead as if someone pulled the plug. There were stars both above and below the object/celestial body when it stopped shining. There is a huge amount of air traffic in this area as we are in a large metropolitan area that is surrounded by two gigantic metropolitan areas ( L.A. and S.D.) and a major military installation ( Camp Pendleton Marine Corps Base ). This craft/thing was unidentifiable to me so I thought you might be interested.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I also noticed several air craft inbound for PDX international airport.They where on approach with there landing lights on.As one of the commercial aircraft flew  over I looked to the south to see how close the next incoming jet was. MY vantage point is on a hill with a view to the south down the willamette river valley. The sky was clear to the south and light overcast to the north. A 1/2 moon was in the west lighting up the 3:30 am sky.It was when I glanced to see the other incoming aircraft that I noticed a large object several miles south and appeared to be at a very high elevation. This object was approaching very fast. faster and higher than the incoming jets. The first thing I noticed was the speed and size of the object then I realized there where no lights or strobes. No identifying marker lights at all. it was grey in color as it reflected or was lightly illuminated from the moon just off to the west of the object. I calkled to my friend who was just inside the front door to come quick. he looked up and immeadetly saw what I was staring at.He said what the heck is that there is no lights.Did it just fly over the inbound traffic pattern.( we are within 12 miles of PDX international and well within the TCA) Neither one of us could figure out what we saw other than a huge un marked grey flat bottom solid shape,high, very high altitude,extremely fast flying and totally silent straight line flying object. It flew from south to north straight line and if it remained on this path it would have had to have flown directly over the end of the runnway in which the commercial aircraft where approaching.Surely PDX tower must have seen this,even if it was at extreme altitude. I assume they would have anyway?The object flew directly over head but dissapeared behind the thin cloud layer just to our north. This object was too big, too high. too unmarked by strobes or any attention getting visuale marking and too quiet,silent infact, to be anything identifiable although we both had a very clear and deffinate view of the craft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with this witness, and he sounded both sincere and credible to us.  We do not know what it was he witnessed.  PD))<n>

I see from your reports that a couplen of people saw something on New Year&#39;s Eve, however no one has reported anything for this date.  Anyway, I was walking home in Pacific Beach (more precisely, I was walking west), and in the sky I saw a little speck of whitish orange light, moving around in a random-looking way, i.e., it danced around back and forth and in loops.  I stopped to watch it, and I thought about running to go get my digital camera, but I worried that it would disappear by the time I returned.  It did not move terribly fast (its entire path was confined to a relatively small area of sky), and it had a sort of &#34;sputtery&#34; or &#34;jittery&#34; motion to it, which is to say that it did not fly smoothly like a plane does, but with a kind of shakiness.  This made me think that it may have been a meteor, but I have seen meteor showers, and what I saw was different: it did not move nearly as fast, nor did it streak in those do as those do.  Rather, it moved around in an odd little path for probably just over a minute and seemed to diminish in brightness and size as it did so, until I really couldn&#39;t follow it anymore, it was so tiny.  Again, this makes me think it was a meteor or some other object that was burning up in the atmosphere -- but do meteors move in such seemingly random paths?  Is there some way to check meteor activity for that date?  Thanks!<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain anonymous.  PD))<n>

I observed a stationary object in the sky northwest of my home at approximately a 330 Degree position from North (Approximately at a 10:00 o&#39;clock position when I faced North).  It was at an altitude that I see many airliners traveling, and appeared to be about 5 miles away from my home.  The object had blue and red lights flashing.  At one time it lit up brightly with a white light.  It did not move for a period of 30 minutes.  My wife came outside and witnessed the object too.  After observing it for 30 minutes, I turned to walk to my deck for about 5 seconds and it disappeared.  During this time I described the light to my Dad, who is a retired US Air Force pilot and Intelligence Officer, on my cell phone.  He called the Missouri State MUFON Director and reported the matter.  The Director tried to contact a MUFON person in the Kansas City area to see if they could observe the object too, but he was unsuccessful in reaching the person.  I did not report the object to any law enforcement or other government official.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

At first I thought it was a missile (I’ve never seen a missile) and that it was headed for the airport.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was afraid, and so pulled the car over to the side of the road.  The bright light suddenly leveled out, stopped and made a sharp turn to the left and disappeared.   Its movement was definitely purposeful, it was not a meteor (I have seen many falling stars) nor was it a plane.   Airplanes don’t travel at that speed, nor do they suddenly stop and make abrupt turns in mid air.<n>

Kind of like that of the Star ship Enterprise! It was just Awe-some to watch but yet a little scarey too!I have watched the Air Force from Fort McCoye doing dog fights above our house,But I have never seen this kind of movement from them either!So this was something totally new or different!Could have been a stelth ..though I don&#39;t know if they can do hyper speed stuff or shoot into space?<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note;  Witness elects to remain semi-anonymous.

When I went out into the backyard to get a better look I noticed there was another one but it was perfectly horizontal. As the horizontal one moved slowly to the left (south), the vertical one descended slowly toward the treetops until they both faded away. The horizontal one was probably 3 times as long as the vertical one. There may be a perfectly good explanation for this but I sure don&#39;t know what it is. I read that iridium flares only last for a few seconds, and this lasted for about 5 minutes so I ruled that out. If you have any ideas I would really appreciate an explanation. I did get a couple of pictures of the vertical one. I am sending them to you. Thanks!<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Both photos are of contrails against a clear sky.  PD))<n>

Two friends and I just got back to my friend ((name deleted)) house in South El Monte from snowboarding at Mt. Baldy and we were relaxing in the jaccuzzi ...I just happened to look upwards into the sky and I seen two objects very high up in the sky. From what I can see with my bare eyes they were white specks in the sky. I thought perhaps they were balloons that someone let go but after a minute of observing them they were at the same spot. I told the guys but they couldn&#39;t see them until I pointed them out to them. The guys said they were stars but I told them that I know that stars are only visible at night and even at dawm or dusk (it was braod daylight!). Next, I jumped out of the jaccuzzi and ran inside the house to grab my binoculars and when I came back outside I looked through the binoculars and I saw 3 more high in the sky! I told them, &#34;Hey! There&#39;s more!&#34; and they didn&#39;t even want to talk about it anymore. However, my friend ((name deleted--witness #1)) got his binoculars and gave them to me because they had a better optical lens. When I looked up in the sky using his binoculars, I was able to distinguish that they were in fact circular disk-like form and white in colour and they moved slighty and when they moved they left a tiny trail which disappeared very quickly but I was not able to see the tiny trail without the binoculars; only one out of the 4 had what appeared to be a blue circular disk-like object sort of affixed to it moving half way around it back and forth. Furthermore, the other 4 moved slightly away from the one with the blue. Right away, I thought about God&#39;s Word and what Ezekiel described what he saw when God revealed himself to him and his description of highly polished bronze &#34;flying wheels&#34; with eyes (portholes) roundabout (all around). After about 5 minutes they were right above our location and the other 4 without the &#34;blue&#34; primarily stayed together while the one with the &#34;blue&#34; was at a distance from them. They were just hovering above us but they were way up there. About 5 minutes later they headed eastward and I lost sight of them.<n>

After taking a look at it, I ran and grabbed the binoculars and we both looked at it and it seemed to be emitting a rainbow of constant clear true colors of red, green, blue, white and yellow. The lights seemed to be coming from  a diagonal line off one side of the craft, but the shape of the craft was hard to see, since small and at a great distance in Southwest sky about 45degrees above the horizon. Very very bright, and never seen any star in that location prior to this.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We watched it for several minutes starting from him viewing it at about 3:45 and still present as of this writing in same location in sky, but seems to have been moving very very slowly Northwest.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke at length via telephone with this witness, and we found her to be quite  serious-minded and credible.

I would guess that it was maybe 400 yards or more away, again this was very hard to tell.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What I saw was what seemed to be a reflection off of something that was roughly about the 400 yards away. It was a reflection almost kinda like you would see if a car goes past you at night while you are standing on the side of a road watching.  What I mean is like if the city lights below this where reflecting off the side of this thing.  I could not see any shape to it just the reflection go down the side as it passed.  Speed was maybe around 80 mph if I had to guess.  There was no noise at all.  It was basically invisible except for the reflection I saw go down its side.<n> <n><n> <n><n> If I was to guess I would say maybe something military? I have heard of electro camoflage that is being tested, who knows maybe this was something like that not sure.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I just wanted to make mention of this thing I saw that night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of the incident is approximate.

The colour of the light was a bright yellow colour like a star there was only 1 of these objects and it was like a star flying across the night sky very fast.

At first, we thought it was an airplane or something, but airplanes don&#39;t have lights like that.  It was moving south very slowly and would get dim and then bright again until it eventually disappeared. This sighting really started to get us curious as to what it was because the week of christmas three of us saw a similar object coming from the same direction and was moving at the same pace. This object however was a fireball because when it got almost right over us something that appeared to be embers fell from it shortly before it burned out or disappeared. We did not see any embers fall from the one last night, but many more people seen it this time.    What is it???????<n>

I wish I knew about it when this actually happened.  I am sorry to report it so late, but I hope this information helps somehow.  We didn&#39;t know where to email/call when it actually happened.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is what our whole family witnessed:  About 2 years ago, in Manchester, Connecticut (we were coming out of John Harvard&#39;s restaurant at Bucklands Hills Mall), our whole family saw an object in the sky that looked like a bright yellow glowing round disk.  Many people around us were looking at the sky pointing at it, as well.  The object was as bright yellow as the moon (the moon was also visible).  It looked like a giant glowing doughnut in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It stayed in one place completely motionless for a few minutes, then it suddenly disappeared and then we noticed it in a totally different parts of the sky (we thought it was the same object, but who knows), then it disappeared again and then we noticed it in another part of the sky, then it disappeared completely.  We (and all the people around us) were stunned.  We&#39;ve never seen anything like that before.  Would love to find out some day what in the world that was.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Strangely enough, and to my great surprise, my son mentioned the following day that his classmate said that her relatives in Mexico called that same night to tell them that they saw the glowing disc-like object behaving &#34;strangely&#34; in the sky (the same night we saw it).  I just thought I was in a twilight zone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Just thought I&#39;d share this information with you, Best regards.<n> <n><n> <n><n> E.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

1/15/05 19:30|Ocala (N and S of)|FL|Triangle|3.5 hours|Multiple types of objects in night sky of central Florida witnessed for over 3 hours.|1/19/05|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/041/S41555.html|117|ndxe200501| Multiple types of objects in night sky of central Florida witnessed for over 3 hours.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This could take a while...my sighting started at 7:30pm 1/15/05 and lasted until 11pm as I drove south on hwy. 301 from Jacksonville, FL.  As I drove S on 301 I eventually noticed an object in the sky SW of me far away and hovering.  One small red light on each side - distance was impossible to guess due to darkness and the small size of the lights, but they were maybe 2 finger-widths apart from each other at that time.  In the direct center of them at about 1 second intervals a white light blinked.  Alternately, above each red light (solidly lit at all times) a very small and fast white light would flash after the center white light would flash.  As I drove towards Ocala, FL on 301 this &#34;hovering&#34; object neither deviated in altitude nor moved from side to side...also, it never became smaller or dimmer indicating that it was moving farther from me as I drove and I was unable to catch up to it...basically, it became very conspicuous to me due to this because that meant to me that it was going the same speed as me and never varied.  Twice I stopped at gas stations on 301 to get a drink or hit the bathroom.  Each time I basically forgot about the object until I got back into my truck and back onto the highway.  Both times this object was still in the exact location of the sky and neither looking closer or further away from me, yet as I again would drive towards it at 70mph it still seemed to stay exactly the same distance from me no matter what.<n> <n><n> <n><n> By now I&#39;m very much unsure that this could be a plane, helicopter or blimp...the lights just weren&#39;t right, plus it&#39;s odd way of staying in the same place all that time whether I was moving or not just seemed impossible and very improbable for a typical aircraft.  Then a second one appeared in the sky just down and to the W of the first one...hovering in the same way.  I say appeared because it didn&#39;t fly to that position but just appeared or turned it&#39;s lights on...same configuration of two solid reds, center white blinker and two blinking whites above the reds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> These two objects stayed this way until I turned W on I think hwy 40 north of Ocala to head to I-75.  then instead of viewing them high up out of my windshield I had to look out my side window and up.  Not long after turning W the object that had appeared second very noticeably began to move W away from the first object, still hovering.  It seemed to be heading SW as it was definitely get smaller in size and much dimmer after a while, but the rate of it&#39;s movement was very slow and deliberate in a straight direction and I was able to view it for a very long time even when it was apparent that it was many many miles S of me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At the I-75 intersection I again stopped at a gas station.  When I came back out 5 minutes later the first object was still hovering and the second though still visible was definitely much farther to the SW but I could still see it&#39;s red lights and blinking whites.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I turned S on I-75 still watching these two objects I finally decided that I needed to tell someone about this because I just didn&#39;t believe now that these were typical aircraft.  So I called my girlfriend and described to her everything I&#39;d seen and thought up to that point asking her not to think I was crazy.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I could still easily see the stationary object blinking away, and I could still see the one that had flown SW away from me.  At this point things went absolutely crazy and unbelievable and I kept my girlfriend on the phone as I described every event to her and I was completely shocked to be seeing what I was seeing...the next events happened almost directly over I-75 and also over the fields to either side E and W and all over the sky S of me as I drove S on I-75...and they happened for over an hour straight:  A very large, bright white object appeared in the sky to the SE of me on the E side of I-75...kind of far from the original object...however that object now began to move W and fly directly over I-75 out over the fields...still in some way looking the same size and brightness even though I was traveling at 65 mph towards it the whole time...very wierd.  At first I was thinking the new object was a planet or star...very large and bright white and not moving at all even though I was heading for it, which is was what made it seem like a star.  As I described to my girlfriend the red lighted object flying left to right in front of me, directly over the highway in the darkness straight to my S a very small white object blinked...then blinked again but easily 2 hand widths to the right...not being sure if it was the same object or a second blinking object at that time all of a sudden multiple white blinking objects  (I think maybe from 3 to 6 or so) began blinking all over in a group form right over I-75.  They weren&#39;t bright...small star type brightness and flashing very fast then maybe off for a second or so...but there were definitely more than 2 since I could see a group of them moving around flashing and then I guess appearing in other locations in the general area of the sky, so either very fast moving and in quick turns of direction or several of them...it was just hard to tell also due to oncoming headlights and also the intervals of very tall street lights messing w/ my eyes...plus it wasn&#39;t easy keeping my eyes on all this as well as the large semi-trucks and other vehicles that I was trying not to swerve into...I was pretty excited at this point and describing it all to my g/f at the same time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It appeared after a couple minutes that I did travel underneath the location of the fast blinkers and I couldn&#39;t see them anymore...during all of this I could now still see the constant hovering large white light plus now three of the red lighted objects moving back and forth to the S and SE and SW of me...moving in different directions very slowly and deliberately and not making any turns.<n> <n><n> <n><n> One of these flew towards the large white light, and around this point my g/f said that I should just pull over but I didn&#39;t want to...about 1 minute later I passed a pick up on the shoulder of the hwy. and the driver was standing next to his truck staring up at the sky...it definitely looked like he was witnessing what I was...I just don&#39;t see how anyone could have missed the red objects, but the fast blinkers were very elusive unless you were paying attention as I had been.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At this time the large white object began to move from E to W over I-75 (this was after the one red lighted object flew over near it&#39;s vicinity).  This really got me excited because now I knew it wasn&#39;t a star...it moved slowly and deliberately from left to right over the hwy to over the farm field area that borders the hwy.  At this point that white object most obviously turned due N to parallel the hwy. though off to my W. It then also decreased altitude so rapidly and sped so quickly towards me that the diameter of the light easily doubled in size and intesity...it actually shocked the shit out of me and I started yelling into the phone, I mean it almost looked like it rocketed down and towards me...it was amazing.  At that point I said screw it and hit the shoulder of the hwy and slammed on the breaks.  Unfortunately I stopped next to a small grove of pine trees blocking the view....but...and this is where I began to believe I wasn&#39;t seeing normal aircraft...This bright object had slowed down very slowly again...the very bright half moon that was out last night was above the object...the bright white light then dimmed almost off and at that time I could then see three tiny green lights in a slim triangular shape as if I was seeing the bottom of the craft at just a slight angle as if it wasn&#39;t quite perfectly horizontal and maybe angeling away from my point of view just enough to see underneath it.  Even better...due to the large bright white light going so dim and the slight illumination of the three green lights at the points of the triangle, I could easily make out the edges of the object connecting the green lights as a triangle...I saw this shape for about 1 second before the white light in the center turned on super bright like a beaming spot light towards me so that all I could see was a large white ball again and it was descending to the ground going behind the tree line I was parked at.  Or else it turned more W away from me making it look as if descending, but it was going lower in the sky either way and through the trees I could see it&#39;s bright light very easily.  I&#39;m conviced this was a triangular shaped object just as I&#39;ve always heard described on TV...I couldn&#39;t believe my eyes and was still describing this to my disbelief over the phone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The wind was hard that night and temps were probably 40 or less, so after this 5 or so minutes of exposure I had to jump back in my truck.  All this time there were still 2 or three red lighted objects either hovering or flying randomly in the sky to the S still.  I saw one tilt itself to a 45 degree angle as it hovered also and then go back horizontally.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I finally got back on the hwy still watching the red objects and about 200 yards down the road the trees ended and everything openned up to a vast farm field...I could still see many objects out there so I pulled over again.  And again the sky went nuts with activity.  At one point I could easily count up to 6 red light objects flying in different directions from N to S and E to W and back again as I looked to the W towards the field.  Some flew at angles directly over me but it was impossible to tell their altitude or size...my hunch though was that they didn&#39;t seem much larger than a commuter plane...Cesna sized or something.  The triangle object was somewhat easier to tell it&#39;s distance from me at that point when the bright light dimmed allowing me to make out it&#39;s edges, and I bet it was not much farther than 1 or 1.5 miles...and since the lights seemed fairly close together I&#39;d guess each side was maybe 40/50 feet or so???  Maybe something like that.  Anyway, back to the field action...<n> <n><n> <n><n> Along w/ all the red light objects directly to the W of me I saw so many fast blinking white lights zooming all over the place in a group...again it was just a crazy show.  They reminded me of when you can see a satellite fly over...that general size of light, like small star sized and the same whitish-blue color.  Only they flashed very quickly and then seemed to re-appear very quickly in another location...hard to guess how many due to their speed and randomness, but they were definitely out there blinking all over.  While all that was going on almost directly above me a red-lighted object appeared right up above me...very bright in color, so it seemed kinda low and larger since the red lights were definitely farther apart on this object...maybe not even a mile up, but I couldn&#39;t tell of it&#39;s shape like I could the triangle.  I don&#39;t know if it just materialized in that location or if it&#39;s lights were out and then just turned on, but it just appeared and then started to fly in a straight line to the SE of me...these things were everywhere and some would fly away to the S but then some would fly in from the N and they would criss-cross the hwy.  I can&#39;t believe people weren&#39;t seeing this, but I just don&#39;t know if they would notice it as odd like I did since I&#39;d been watching them for so long by this point.  I think this second stop on the hwy lasted about 20 minutes watching all kinds of activity...I was freezing and shivering almost uncontrolably by then, but refused to get back in my truck for risk of missing even more activity or something more spectacular.  But the fast blinkers seemd to disappear eventually, and the red-light objects decreased down to like 2 and were again hovering to the S of me.  So I got back in my truck and started S again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;ll tell you that by this point as exciting as it had been it started to get a little boring and even my g/f was ready to get off the phone with me and my descriptions...she just didn&#39;t want me to wreck my truck (I almost did several times though).  So I hung up with her.  I eventually didn&#39;t see anymore objects in the sky and was getting to around 40 miles or so from Tampa on I-75.  I was still in somewhat of shock or disbelief over all of this and decided to call one of my best friends to tell him all about it...I knew he wouldn&#39;t think I was lying or crazy.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I neared finishing my story of everything that happened one of the red-light objects appeared again very low and just to the SW of me on the freeway...just out of no where and bam there it was, and this was while my friend was still on the phone.  You could tell it was moving slightly to the W and then it began to roll into a 45 degree angle to the right and then it rolled back to horizontal and then to about 45 degrees angle to the left as it slowly flew W away from me.  I was able to watch it fly very low to the W until it disappeared from view.<n> <n><n> <n><n> These things just weren&#39;t planes or helicopters...I was able to view them for such a long time that I&#39;m convinced they weren&#39;t airplanes, blimps or helicopters.  My main confusion is just that if these were secret government craft then why the hell fly them over a freeway with lights flashing and not in the desert of Nevada.  And if these were alien craft why the hell have all those lights on and be seen???  And also is there anyway to find out if they showed up on radar???  I didn&#39;t see any news of this today on the net or TV or radio, so I don&#39;t know what to think.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was even kinda ready to not think they were UFO&#39;s up until that freakin&#39; white ball zoomed like it did and then showed itself as a triangle for that second or so...that blew my mind to see a triangle after hearing about them on TV all these years...this was the most bizarre thing I&#39;ve ever witnessed, and as I searched tonight I found this link and decided to try and write it all down to you.  That&#39;s the whole story though...even though so much of it is like burned into my mind and I can still visualize what I saw and the sequence of events I still think I left some out because there was just so much activity going on at once for such a long time.  Sure wish I&#39;d had a video or something.<n> <n><n> <n><n> That&#39;s it though.  I&#39;m going to copy what I&#39;ve written to you and post it on other sites if I find any worthy ones.  Maybe someone else who saw those things last night will stumble across my story and corroborate it.  Let me know if you have any questions.  thank you.

I noticed a passenger airliner flying very low in the sky heading roughly southeasterly in direction.  The plane was in my direct field of vision and VERY close.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was then I witnessed three white or silver spheres emerge from behind the airliner headed in a slightly different direction (east), but much more slowly.  They appeared to be extremely close to fuselage.  I immediately stopped in my tracks and began to observe intently.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Two were very close together with one trailing behind somewhat.  They were lined up in a line parallel to the ground.  I could see something black swirling around them every few seconds.  They made absolutely no sound.  I watched them proceed eastward until they left my sight.  I have never seen anything like this.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have a background in the Air Force and I spent several years in western states that are considered &#34;hotbeds&#34; for UFO activity.

It was in SE MI close to the Detroit River, and it was in the eastern sky so it was over Canada.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It looked almost like a comet, I actually thought it was a huge meteor and was waiting to see where it would land (I do admit my heart was pumping thinking of movies like &#34;Deep Impact&#34;, etc)  As it moved down toward the horizon, I watched it change from a long rectangular shape, to simply oblong, to circular, and finally I couldn&#39;t see it all.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I noticed this while waiting for a train, so I had a several minutes to watch it. can a meteor or space debris stay in the sky for 3 minutes? (give or take a min.)  CAn a satellite be seen in the daytime or look that big?<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date is approximate.

I have discussed this with any number of people and sought adise from interested people.  I have visited at least one web site in the North east, I belive who reported this occurance.  I began photographing the holes as they appear and have recorded  at least a dozen or more.  Friends postulate that perhaps deer have fallen through the ice, and I have recorded those events.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What seems strange to me is that the ice is several inches thick and the holes are of different sizes and in different locations on the pond.  I have inquired of people living near by who have ponds, only one person observed such hole but attributed the events to deer falling into the ponds. If I were to hazard a gues as to the ballistic nature of these occurances, it seems that a low flying plane would have dropped a bowling ball onto the ice.  Some holes are small, 4 or 5 inches in diamiter, some are 8 to 10 inches.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Peolpe from the university&#39;s goelogical survey suggested warm springs causing the holes, but that seemed difficult to accept.<n>

I have spent a great deal of time &#34;looking up&#34; over the past year and will continue to &#34;sleep under the stars&#34; every once in a while but I refuse to let what I have seen absorb so much of my life. I have since had a cowardly object &#34;look my way&#34; on two seperate occassions. My opinion is that these objects move in a friction-less pathway(vacuum?)that is somehow created in an open environment. I can&#39;t help but feel like however and whatever is going on up there gives me a feeling of &#34;trouble on the horizon&#34; and short of grabbing a .50cal or whatever I can get my hands on and trying my best to &#34;get some&#34; or have &#34;my effect&#34; on their lives.

I couldnot see anything else even against the dark background except for this red blinking light.

The towns are about a 10 minute drive apart.  So I&#39;m driving down route 25 at 9:20 P.M. and as soon as I got on the main road I noticed a big bright light in the sky.  It stood out because it was a pitch black sky with no stars.  So as I&#39;m driving I kept my eye on it because it was unusual.  It didn&#39;t move so I thought maybe it was a star.  The closer I got to it I realized it wasn&#39;t a star because it had colored lights.  But it wasn&#39;t a plane because it just hovered in the sky.  I opened my car window and it was silent(not a helicopter)It didn&#39;t move at all, it was completely still. When I had a perfect view I pulled my car over to see it.  Another car pulled over to(I don&#39;t know if they were looking at it also?) I realized a police car was on the side of the road too. The police drew my attention for a few seconds, I looked back up at the sky in all directions and it was gone. There is no way any plane could disapppear out of sight completely within a few seconds. The best way I could describe the object was a sphere shape, VERY bright and with blue and red lights on either side.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Driving down the road in the dark country side I came around a bend and my headlights shine on an Oval craft of somesorts in the distance. It was Maybe 50 feet or so off the ground on the road. It left quickly off into the sky after I witnessed it. I had my camera in the passenger seat and tried to take what pictures i could of it fleeing. I&#39;ll get those developed today sometime.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I was on Indiana SR24 just to the Southwest of Wabash heading toward Peru Indiana and US31. It was dusk behind me and still light ahead of my in the west.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I saw what I first thought was a star. It was 30-35% and bright. It caught my attention because it was brighter than the brightest star in the night sky, but it was still daylight ahead of me. I noticed another &#34;star&#34; like it immediately to my right. The second object was like the first and equally bright. It was level with the first object. At that point I realized that I was seeing something far out of the natural.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A third object appeared to the left of the first object. It &#34;faded in&#34; and went from being unnoticeable to gradually increasing in brightness until it was a bright as the other two objects. It was level with the original two objects. When it reached the brightness of the original two objects all three disappeared. All three objects were white like a star.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I wondered if the lights could be attached to a power line( making them level) near an airport. I drove on 24 for miles and the lights didn&#39;t reappear nor did I find a power line. Several minutes after I saw the lights I saw the lights of an aircraft in the same area. I wondered if it might be looking for what I had seen. the lights I saw did not appear to be aircraft, they had not flickering lights of chem trail.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I submit this report anonymously.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Each of the bright spheres emerged, i.e. faded in, one at a time until all three were easily visible. They appeared to be very different from normal aircraft lights. We know that there are several airfields in the area, but these were not wing or tail lights from any aircraft I know. I can usually recognize those types of lights, since I used to be in the Air Force and had worked in the aerospace defense industry. Shortly after they emerged, they began to fade out in the order they appeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When they were visible, they seemed to have lined up in a straight line but were not evenly spaced apart. Along with these large bright lights we noticed what seemed to be dozens of smaller white lights flying around in no particular pattern that we could distingush. These lights were much smaller than the three big ones mentioned above but were even more intriguing to us. We noticed that these lights would streak across the sky from east to northwest, south to north, and west to east, some in a straight and level flight pattern, some in a random pattern. We saw some of these fly level and then suddenly shoot upward or downward vertically. I have never seen an aircraft move in this fashion. I know that the g-forces alone from such maneuvers would make it highly unlikely that these aircraft were ours. I could actually see what appeared to be contrails behind some of them at times. This lasted for about 20 minutes as we continued traveling south.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Visibility was generally good that evening with little cloud cover during this event.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The craft had three lights on its underside that were round in shape flashing or pulsing pink, blue, and white lights. The craft was moving at a slow speed and was about 50 ft. long the helicopter was folowing right behind it. I was scared that they might see me looking and I held the drapes down low peeking through the bottom of the window. As the craft got closer to my house I got realy scared and felt as if they knew I had witnessed this, the moment I thought this somthing pinned me down face first into my bed and injected me with somthing in my back. I woke up later that morning and had remembered everything. I asked  my sister who sleeps in the room next to mine if she saw or heard what I had witnessed she is a heavy sleeper and was not awakened. Nothing could have got in my room that night unless it was not human and came in through the walls or somthing this is realy strange to me. I did not see any marks or pin pricks on my back. I began to think maby it was a bad dream and left it at that, but that was until I did a search on flying triangles and saw all the reports and some videos with the exact same craft I realized that it must have been real.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of the event is approximate.

Then I watched as the two hazy lights flew in a perfect circle following each other in what seemed to be a game. One would catch up to the other while the other flew behind. This lasted roughly forty-five minutes. All the while dogs around the neighborhood barked loudly together (strange). Around 11:45 pm the two lights instantly joined as one while my mother and I watched as the one light circled by itself for roughly ten more minutes. The light then instantly disappeared, leaving no trace of its presence in the night sky. There was no sound whatsoever. The object/s was definitely above the clouds, because the light became brighter as it traveled through thinner areas of the cloud.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The formation consisted of three red lights (one behind the other in the direction of travel) on the western side of the formation, and two red lights (one behind the other in the direction of travel) on the eastern side of the formation. The group of lights were in &#34;bowling pin&#34; formation, not a &#34;chevron&#34; formation.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The lights had approximately 2-3 degrees of arc separation between each of them. Each light was a diffuse red &#34;disc&#34;, approximately 0.2 degrees of arc in diameter.  All the lights were uniform in color and size, and had a constant intensity. They moved in exactly a straight line, at constant velocity, from the North-Northeast to the South-Southwest. It took approximately 8-9 seconds for the group of five lights to travel from directly over head to approximately 30 degrees above the horizon. No noise was observed. The sky was very clear-no clouds, or haze. The ambient was approximately 15 F. No shape, glow, or shadow was visible between the red lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am an amatuer astronomer. This was a naked eye sighting. I was looking at the Pleides and Orion, when I noticed the group of lights moving rapidly overhead. I have seen high and low altitude plane lights, satellites, and meteors, but I have never seen anything like this pass overhead across the night sky before.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

This group of lights were clustered in the shape I would describe as a tiara or crown.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As i looked at this appearent object a single light departed from the object and descended toward the ground at a sharp angle, looking very much under control- moving steadily on in a straight line toward the Earth. I pulled over to the side of the road, afraid that I might lose sight of the object and rolled down my car window.  The object had been pulsing slowly brighter then dimmer at a slow but steady pace during my observation of it and seconds after I stopped it faded into the clouds.  I remained for a couple minutes to see if it might emerge again, but I saw nothing more.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was approximately -34 to -44 degrees below zero with a strong wind and dark.  It was colder inside our automobiles than outside so we waited outside our vehicles while they were warming up.  I looked up at approximately south, southeast (which was above the discount store building) to observe an object, in the shape of a trapezoid, that was large enough that it&#39;s bottom was 7 degrees above the horizon and it&#39;s top was 24 degrees above the horizon.  The object had a cluster of lights that were semi structured / semi randomly placed that apeared mother of pearl in color.  It was stationary regardless of the wind.     I waited to see if the other person observed it as well then he asked me if I was seing what he was seeing.  After observing it for about 15 minutes it moved 5 degrees to the right then went stationary again.  At this time our vehicles were warm so we both drove home.  It just so happens that I lived 1.4 miles in the direction of the object.  So I observed it getting larger as I drove toward it.  From the balcony of my appartment I observed it for another 15 minutes.  Then I went to sleep due to exhaustion.  I since then have taken GPS readings from both sighting locations.  With the help of University Scientists I have obtained Infrasound and Weather Radar Data.  The infrasound data may not be related based on university staff reccomendations.  Also, the infrasound readings are below audible levels.  I did not hear any noise. However two bars of infrasound do appear.  One bar at about 21:00 the other bar maybe 45 minutes later. (The one scientist that explained this to me became upset when I expressed my intention to report this data.) It is estimated that the object was 45 miles away and 4,000 feet above the earth. (?) With the help of three mathematicians I estimate the width of the object to be about 23.3 miles wide. ! It is t hought to be of a natural origin.  However, it did seem to exhibit some movement that suggests intelligent operation.  But I cringe at that speculation.  The creative part of me wants to elaborate and fill in the blanks.  But the logical side of me is struggling to explain it away as a natural phenomenon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have put together a 77 page book on it and sold one copy over ebay.

It was a clear night -44 Degrees Below Zero.  There was a slight breeze moving from left to right of viewing plane.  I estimate the breeze moving from East to West.  We were looking south from the parking lot.  The object hovered silently and stayed stationary regardless of the breeze.  After about 5-10 minutes the object began to move slightly toward the right of the viewing plane.  The object then stopped again and remained stationary.  While observing it I waited for ((name deleted)) to see it since I did not want to imply what I was seeing.  He then looked up where I was looking and asked, &#34;What the hell is that?&#34;  Be both observed it for a few more minutes then both decided to go home.  He drove up to murphy Dome Road and said it was no longer in his sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object stayed stationary as we both went home.  The object was in my path as I drove home, moving toward it, so I watched it as I was driving home looking to see if it would get any bigger.  I am still not sure if it did get any bigger.  Later measurements seem to indicate that it did appear larger at my appartment.  At my appartment, I observed the object from my balcony and still was trying to explain it away.  I convinced myself that it was lights from a far away building I never knew existed before, and had a feeling that it would be there in the morning.  However, I convinced myself of this in spite that I knew it was a wrong assumption.  This was because the structure of the placement of the lights were sort of in a random pattern of distribution and that I had seen it moving.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had a camera with me but assumed that it would be there in the morning.  I went to bed, due to exaustion, after 30 minutes had elapsed from the initial sighting to the balcony sighting even thought the object was still visible.    So my visual sighting took only about 30 minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> However, after a conversation with a Physics Personnel at the University of Alaska, Geophysical Institute, we obtained infrasound readings of what may be the object.  The infrasound readings indicate that there might have been an engine signature on Atmospheric Entry and then another signature on Exiting the Earths Atmosphere.  The infrasound readings obtained sounds well below human hearing levels.  Anyhow, two distinct readings do exist that happen to be approximately 45 minutes apart.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am still in the process of obtaining weather radar data, and any other data possible.<n>

There were five objects moving in different directions.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Three of the objects were clearly aircraft, with each having multiple red and white lights (one or two blinking on each object).<n> <n><n> <n><n> However, a fourth object - a single white, non-blinking light, which appeared twice as bright as the aircraft lights, and was at a higher altitude - moved from west to east in a straight line. (From time to time, it seemed to zig-zag slightly, and this may have been an atmospheric effect, but I did not see this effect when watching the other four objects.)  As the west/east light entered the eastern part of the sky, a fifth object - a smaller, non-blinking white light - moved south to north through the eastern sky in a straight line, on a path and at a speed where it would meet the west/east light. Before this could happen, however, this fifth, south/north light grew very bright (about ten times brighter) and then quickly faded out. The west/east light, after crossing the point where it would have met the south/north light, also faded out. I thought clouds could account for these disappearances, but I immediately checked local and regional radar at Wunderground.com, and the skies were what they appeared to be: &#34;Clouds: clear. Visibility: 10 miles.&#34;  I also thought that the steady brightness of the west/east and south/north lights could be fuselage reflections of the sun - but sunset was one hour and thirteen minutes earlier, at 16:42. Both objects, though higher in altitude than the three aircraft, were much lower in altitude than satellites I have watched from the same location.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Two smaller coloured craft came away from the motherships and kept descending as if looking for something and also took semicircular jumps from one area to another. I grabbed my camcorder and went to my sons bedroom window  as I filmed the smaller craft tweo of the larger  orbs started to appear and move upwards at this point they made my camera zoom out and I had to physically zoom in again they then made  the picture defocus but they are visible for a short while. my tape was almost out but I got several lights at intervals then they would disappear behind the hills. The large orbs were very light the smaller ones looked orange and blue. They moved huge distances more quickly than any aircraft could and quite effortlessly. Trying to stop me film amazed me totally. At 9amm we saw the last light in the sky they seemed to be moving further away but I will look again tonight. During this time I had to get a handicapped child off to school so I kept coming back and catching glimpses of the lights as they searched for something.I live near Devonport Nuclear Submarinr base and they may have also bee dippiong down into the water.

Friend reports seeing a bright object streak across the sky so fast that he initially thought it was a meteor. Then the object suddenly stopped and turned towards his position and moved very slowly. He says the altitude was so low that he could have shot it if he was so inclined. Among the things he noticed are the following: 1. Absolutely no sound. He could hear nothing, but it was definitely close enough where he SHOULD have heard something.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 2. It had wing-type structures and a tail. This was not a &#34;Saucer&#34; or anything like that, however it seemed to be flying too slow for a fixed-wing plane.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 3. There were more lights on this craft than are on commercial/civil aircraft.

It was wierd because the lights were close to me but only the lights were visible.  And there was no sound either.  The lights came and were in an unorginized group.  It&#39;s also wierd because I live by the airport and I would think they would have spoted it on radar or saw it.  To my knowledge I&#39;m the only person who saw it, I was out in my backyard<n>

In the old days, I listened to Sputnik and watched the ECHO satellites.  I have built telescopes and have spent many hours watching and photographing the sky.  Over the years, I have seen all of the usual UFO candidates like satellites, flocks of birds, highflying aircraft, balloons, blimps, and rocket launches (we can see them from Vandenberg).  So, I am reporting this in the hope that someone can give me an explanation for what I saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The sky was clear and dark.  I was looking for a comet when I saw three orange lights (approx magnitude 4) traveling at an apparent high rate of speed from north to south, passing about 3 degrees west of the Pleiades.  I believe that their altitude was greater than that of an aircraft on approach to LAX or Burbank.  Even though the sky was dark and clear, the lights did not appear to be true points of light, as the stars did.  I had the impression that they had ?dimension?.  It was as though I was viewing them through a light cloud, but there were no clouds.  One light was distinctly ahead of the other two by at least 2 degrees.  The trailing two appeared to be side-by-side with approximately a ¼ to ½ degree separation.  One of the trailing two then appeared to overtake the other and their separation decreased to near zero.  The one that appeared to overtake the other then went slightly ahead.  They all vanished about 45 degrees above the southern horizon.  There was no sound or trail.  The behavior is consistent with a typical satellite, except that there were three at once and the apparent passing of one by another.  I checked satellite-viewing websites and could not find any naked eye satellites that would have matched what I saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I was driving down the road toward the center of town and noticed what i thought were two extremly bright street lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As i drove closser I saw that the lights were moving slowly across the road and appeared to get much larger than the surrounding street lights. I immediatly felt allarmed and slowed the van to observe the lights. once I got about 100 yards away from it I saw a very large triangular , almost boomerang shaped object hovering mabee 200 feet off the road at a very low altitude (mabee 250 feet). The bright lights were set out on the points of its &#34;wings&#34; there were no other lights and it made absolutly no noise as i passed it by.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About 3 miles down the road I found a spot to turn arround hopping to see it again but it was gone. I told my freinds at work, they didnt belive me, and I went back to work as normal.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I couldent have been the only one to see it, the road was fairly busy and other cars were slowwing down to see it.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Through my windshield I could see the craft clearly as it stood out from the orange haze of the city lights.  It was dark colored, black and grey with a patterned design on the bottom.  It didn&#39;t look metallic, there were no reflections.  It had a dim white light at each point and a very bright pulsing white orb directly in the center underneath.  It flew somewhat slowly, in a gliding motion, rotating slowly and emitting no sound.  I exited the freeway at Gorman road and turned East to watch it.  It traveled low and slowly along the outskirts of Lancaster before circling around the city and vanishing in the mountains to the south.  I snapped serveral pictures with a disposable of the craft as it flew around the city.  (I will send a copy if they come out.)  After the craft disappeared, I got back on the freeway heading South once more.  About a mile from the Antelope Valley Mall the craft suddenly appeared to the East. It glided over the freeway again!  I know the cars behind me had to have seen it.  It flew directly over them.  This time I could see the craft at eye level as there is a slope to the east.  I was unable to grab my camera and the craft flew behind me and into the west somewhere.  There were other planes in the area at the time and I am sure that what I encountered twice was no conventional aircraft.  There were many other witnesses on the freeway that night that must have seen this thing.  It was huge... AND... It practically flew right over Lancaster.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

(I live on West 13th St Ashtabula Ohio.)  I was thinking that it was probably &#34;Life flight&#34; coming into ACMC (Ashtabula County Medical Center) so I stayed at the bottom of my driveway to watch. When it got closer the white light diminished. By the time that this craft was over me I could swear I could see a black triangular shape with a series of different colored lights flashing rapidly on all three corners. No noise! Was listening for chopper sounds. Never heard them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Well,  I ran back down to my brother&#39;s house to have him come outside. When he got outside it was to far away. My brother didn&#39;t know what to think. All of a sudden my brother asked,&#34;Whats that?&#34; Another one (higher up; again no noise and flying from the west)lights flashing on and off but no distinctive shape. Just as we were about to discuss what we saw? A third one appeared ( A little lower than the second and you could make out just a little bit of a strange shape.) lights rapidly flashing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I went down to the Medical Center to see if a helicopter was on the pad to make sure. No signs of a helicopter there. Everything was quiet!<n>

The arrangement of the lights indicated that there may have been a disk or saucer like shape to the actual object. After driving down the road about .5 to .75 miles, we turned and headed back toward Arbuckle.  It was still visible as we hit the town and cruised about a mile through it, north bound, as well as about an additional 2 miles north of town as we headed to turn east onto Hahn Rd. Allthewhile, it continued to flash a great distance out, as it stayed pretty much just a little north of our vision - indicating a great distance between us and the object or that it was moving with us, more than likely it is the former explanation.  After about 2 miles down Hahn, we headed south on Grimes-Arbuckle Rd. again, at this point we all acknowledged seeing some new unexplainable bluish-green lights along the 2047 drain (a run-off of the Sacramento River).  This was the area at which my hubby and friend saw the red flashing lights earlier (see other report).  This area is about 1 mile from where we were, at that point.  We then headed back to Arbuckle after having scaled about 6 miles of road around a big square of fields and orchards.  Both my husband and friend have seen objects/lights in our area and elsewhere.  I have unfortunately seen many objects/lights and the like through out my life, within the central and northern areas of California.  There is also a somewhat extensive encounter record for my family.  All three of us are college educated and were of sound state of mind at the times of the sightings.  No one was intoxicated nor on any type of drug (save for the pack of smokes we in turn smoked as a result of shock/fear/yadayada!!!).<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The lights are not there normally and were flashing one at a time. It was visable almost the whole drive and until we entered our friends home. No sounds came from the object. It looked like it was about a mile away over a water-way that is a run off of the sacramento river.  There was a car ahead of us that may have also witnessed the lights.  We didn&#39;t have a camera with us or eles we would have taken pictures to send you.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We are friends that drive  this road almost daily.

I love to watch the winter stars and the high-altitude jetliners as they move across the night sky. The stars move slowly from east to west, and here the jetliners move swiftly from east to west as they make their way to the bay area airports. My wife went to bed early so I decided to soak in the spa for awhile (one beer when I got home and a single glass of wine with dinner). Facing due south in the spa a boomerang shaped, translucent object entered my field of vision (from behind and to the right) moving from NW to SE. Lack of visual reference cues makes this thing impossible to size, but it moved like a big object and the reflection of the street and city lights glowed dimly off the curved bottom surface at a seemingly moderate height, well below the airliner traffic. It made no sound and really seemed to be more a boomerang shaped disturbance in the air rather than a visible object. Speed was impossible to judge, except to say that it took 20 to 25 seconds to traverse my field of vision. I jumped up and stood in the spa to view as much of this thing as possible while it disappeared behind the houses across the street. This is the first clear and cloudless night in central California after many days of rain.

I pointed it out to my mom who was looking in the wrong direction then she caught sight of it, she said oh it&#39;s just a cloud. I said that&#39;s no normal looking cloud. Then I noticed it going staight up higher into the sky. I know planes have to climb a higher altitude to be able to travel a longer distance.

This is the 4th time I&#39;ve seen a light like this.  (I previously reported them last year.)  I drove in to tell my husband who was ahead of me and after I got gas, I left the station and saw that the light was still in the sky.  I raced home and went upstairs to view from a bedroom window.  I wanted my mother who is visiting from Houston to see these lights because they are so unusual.  My husband, mother and myself watched the light and saw it elongate and appear to be a craft with 3 lights.  I called a friend who lives approximately 1/2 a mile from me and she and her husband went outside to view the lights as well.  We watched them for about 20 more minutes.  During this time another craft seemed to come from behind the first one that looked identical to the first one and it slowly separated from the other one and moved further across the horizon.  Then they both seemed to fade out.  I&#39;m not sure that I can rule out a helicopter.  There was no sudden erratic movement of either.  But during all of this there were several other planes in the sky both around these objects and in completely other directions.  I wanted to report it in hopes that if there were other reports it would helpful.  My location is at McDowell Mountain Ranch Road and 105th Str.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

This big light right above me draw my attention, it was right above me maybe 1500 feet, I could distinguish the shape an oval shape with four rectangular shaped windows with brilliant colors. I grabbed my cell to call my daughter to tell her what i was seeing. Suddenly I lost sight of it and then I saw it again but it was on the right side.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I was inside the house. I could see the window. Suddenly I saw 2 lights, a red &amp; a white 1. The red was following the white. They appeared slightly to the northeast of our porch. The event lasted about a half second. This has happened before, 2 times before this. Each time they were in the same spot, &amp; they looked the same. The lights were small, hazy circles. They left a small trail that dissapeared quickly. The background was the dark sky. The lights were far above the trees. I know that these are UFOs because shooting stars (or burnig metors) do not happen in the exact same place, &amp; around the same time. This is the 1st time I have reported this because I thought that the 1st times must have been a coincidence. Now I am convinced that these are UFOs. I will send a drawing of the event, so that you may investigate it as accurately as possible.(I am sorry I have no phisical evidence.)<n>
1/10/05 19:00|Fortescue (over the Delaware Bay)|NJ|Circle|30 seconds|Light with erratic flight pattern|1/11/05|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/041/S41461.html|178|ndxe200501| Light with erratic flight pattern<n> <n><n> <n><n> My boyfriend and I had taken a trip down to Fortescue beach, which is very quiet during the winter months.  At night you can see the lights of Dover Airforce Base across the Delaware Bay.  We were just standing on the beach talking and as I always do I was looking up.  The sky seemed to be very active with planes, and I am always on the lookout, epecially on Fortescue beach, perhaps to just to catch a glimpse of a low flying plane heading in or out of DAB.  We were on the beach or sitting nearby from about 6:30 until 7:30PM  It was already dark.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My boyfriend is a skeptic and has never in his 51 years seen anything that he could call a UFO.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The temperature was about 40 degrees with no wind.  There were some low altitude patchy clouds that seem to be making their way out as I was seeing more and more stars.  There was a slight amount of haziness to the atmosphere, perhaps later in the evening it would turn foggy, but Dover was still visable.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was watching one light that was about 30 degrees up from the horizon, waiting for it to turn enough or for it to get closer so that I could see the strobe lights blinking and confirm that it was indeed an airplane.  It was white, perhaps a slightly yellow color.  It was out over the water, apparently and about 20 degrees right of the last row of visible lights at Dover.  I was facing for the most part West, perhaps slightly South.  I watched the light move at a what seemed a normal speed for a plane, moving &#34;right.&#34;  I noticed what seemed like some irregularity in it&#39;s speed as it continued moving to the right.  It seemed to slow and speed up slightly, but it was not very obvious.  It then shot up and to the right slightly and very quickly at about a 70 degree angle of accent and about five degrees up.  I then alerted my boyfriend who had been looking elsewhere, never taking my eyes off of it.  We both then saw it move right and slightly up a few more degrees more quickly than the first time I had seen it, but it&#39;s erractic speed was more apparent.  It then shot down at about a 45 degree angle with the erractic speed still visible, even though it was moving quickly, only going a few more degrees and then it turned a sharp &#34;v&#34; turn, maybe 15 degrees from being directly vertical and much more quickly than before, shot up, got about ten degrees and disappeared apparently into the low lying clouds.  We looked for it, but it was gone.  We watched the sky for half an hour more but never saw anything else like it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had a similar experience about a year ago, listed on this website, in Millville, New Jersey, which is about ten miles away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About fifteen minutes later we had gotten in the car to get warm and were still watching the sky.  We saw coming at us another light, but saw the strobe lights, from the same area of the sky as the unexplained light.  We watched it for less than a minute and we could tell it was headed straight for us, guessing I would say a few thousand feet up.  I watched the white part of the light &#34;turn&#34; and get very bright as if a helicopter had made a turn to go right at us.  But it was still too far out to hear the engine.  The light &#34;turned on a dime&#34; and we both agreed at that point that it had to be a chopper.  It headed over us within a minute, seemed to be roughly a thousand feet up or more, and we could hear the engine of what sounded like a prop plane, and not a helicopter.  I&#39;m not an expert on planes, but we both got the feeling that we were being checked out, and just assumed that it would be a helicopter, epecially the way it appeared to make a turn directly toward us without having to &#34;circle around&#34; like a plane. Perhaps the light &#34;turning to face us&#34; makes sense to others who will read this.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There are several houses near the beach but there were only two homes that appeared to be occupied with full time residents.  The road along the beach was otherwise empty of cars.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We have discussed making further observations at this location and I will further document any occurances here.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

After watching this &#39;star&#39; for about a minute, I noticed it moving in a southeast direction at a very slow speed. I could see with my naked eye, several different colors flashing, so I thought it must be an airplane of some sort at a fairly high altitude.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am very knowledgeable regarding aircraft, since I am a licensed commercial pilot and former flight instructor.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This &#39;aircraft&#39; did not appear to be moving at a steady rate of speed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After watching this &#39;thing&#39; for several minutes, it suddenly split into 3 different and distinct lights. I could not make out what exact shape they were, and at this time I called for my wife to bring out the binoculars. She quickly came out with them and I focused them as quickly as possible. By the time I got them adjusted, the three lights became only one, with the same blinking.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We watched this &#39;thing&#39; for the next 15 or so minutes, me looking through the binoculars and my wife with only her eyes, it suddenly split into 2 distinct lights, one white light shooting straight into the atmosphere, the other white light shooting in a northerly direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The rate of speed could not be calculated, but it was only a matter of maybe a couple of seconds before the objects were both out of sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> No noise was heard, and I suspect the objects were many miles away and at an altitude again, that could not be judged, but it was most likely above 18,000 feet.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The sky at this time was clear, and the big dipper could be observed to our northeast direction.  Other stars were visible also.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We then went back inside to eat dinner, and around 730pm I went outside to see if this &#39;star&#39; was still in the general vicinity, but, of course, it was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;ve been flying since 1975, hold a commercial license with single engine, multi engine, seaplane, and CFI-II ratings.

1/10/05 17:24|Denver (I-25, southbound)|CO||20-30 sec.|Solo driver witnesses oblong, rectangular object w/ lights moving to the north above freeway|9/2/05|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/045/S45275.html|181|ndxe200501| Solo driver witnesses oblong, rectangular object w/ lights moving to the north above freeway<n> <n><n> <n><n> In the beginning of January 2005 (I forget the date) at 5:24 pm while driving southbound on Interstate 25 south of Denver, Colorado I saw an oblong object in the sky, flying (what seemed to be very slowly) above me, northbound directly up the highway.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Its size and speed was hard to determine, not knowing exactly how far away it was, and because there was nothing I could compare it to, I could not make a determination.  It seemed to be anywhere from about 20 feet to an undetermined length, and it seemed to be doing anywhere from 10 miles per hour to an undetermined speed, and it seemed to be anywhere from 100 feet high to an undetermined altitude.  If I had to guess I’d say it was about 50 to 100 feet long and about 200-500 feet above me, and was traveling at about 40 miles per hour or maybe a little faster. But this is just a guess...it could have been bigger but it was impossible to determine.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My first impression was that it was a bunch of Canadian geese flying in ‘line-abreast’ formation, because I had just seen (a minute or two earlier) a ‘V’ formation of them flying north.  However upon closer examination, what I saw was not a group of individual birds flying in a line, abreast, but it was a solid object.  I then thought it must be a piece of black polythene or polyethylene caught in the wind like a kite.  However upon closer examination I was able to determine that it was solid and ‘plank-like’.  It kept its rigid form and in no way fluttered or flexed or was jostled or buffeted or affected by the wind or breeze.  It held its course and form.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I say it looked black because at that time of evening, it was silhouetted against the sky.  It could have been some color for all I know, but it appeared to be black.  I noticed two small ‘bumps’ on the leading-edge of one end of what I’ll call this ‘wing.’  These small protuberances for lack of a better definition (other than ‘bumps’) were not exactly the same size but were almost the same, and were immediately adjacent to one-another.  My thought was that if this was some random piece of junk caught-up in the breeze, then it would not be completely symmetrical, so I immediately checked the opposite end of the leading edge to see if there were bumps there also.  I saw that there were an identical set of bumps in exactly the same place on the other end.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This object looked like a board, flying sideways up the highway above me. Not exactly streamlined for sure.  In fact it was the most un-aerodynamic thing you could imagine. Certainly not something that would work in a wind-tunnel. I could see clearly that it had 90 degree corners and features.  It had no perceptible camber nor rounded edges.  It was not ‘airfoil-shaped.’ It had no anhedral nor dihedral nor sweepback. Its form and the speed it was flying defied Bernoulli’s principle.  It had no separate fuselage nor engines nor tail/empennage nor visible flight-control surfaces, no external anti-torque devices, neither did it display any lights or markings.  No perceptible intake or exhaust, no props, jets or rotors, windows, vents nor antennas. There was nothing attached to it nor hanging out of it. What I saw was unlike anything I’ve seen, heard or read about.  Just picture a giant, black, symmetrical board moving in the sky, steadily in one direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I could not relate to it in any way except to feel (mere speculation here) that for the lift and thrust and weight factors of aerodynamics, it must utilize some undisclosed type of technology such as magnetics for propulsion/stabilization and to overcome gravity, and ionization of the atmosphere to overcome drag through the air.  I was unable to hear any sound from the object, because I was inside my car amongst traffic in the fast lane.  There were a couple of vehicles pulled-over on the side of the road at this point, but I didn’t really take my eyes off the object long enough to see if the occupants were watching the unknown flying object also.  What surprised me the most was that I didn’t hit my brakes and create a major traffic jam or accident, but rather just calmly thought: &#34;Now that’s curious.&#34;  Some have talked about dimensional shift, dematerialization technology or thought projection, but I can’t go there at this point because it’s a little beyond my paradigm.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I’m guessing the duration of this sighting was about 20-30 seconds from the time I first saw it off in the distance to the time we both ‘closed’ on each-other and it went overhead while I craned my neck, and pressed my face to the windscreen to watch it as long as I could before it disappeared in my blind spot overhead because of the roof of the car.  Even though the thought seemed ‘silly’ to even contemplate from the scene I was witnessing, I consciously looked to see if there were any wires or poles supporting this object as the suggestion crossed my mind that maybe all it was, was some object hung over the highway, and the movement was due to a ‘relative motion’ illusion.  There was nothing I could see to support this idea at all. Besides the object was moving relative to the highway also.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was as conscious and lucidly awake when I witnessed this event, as now when I’m writing this description of the event.  I have no idea what it was, nor do I have the slightest clue if it was our technology, or where it came from.  I’m totally at a loss to explain what I saw. Kinda cool though.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((name deleted))<n> <n><n> <n><n> Sketch of what I saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date in January 2005 is approximate.

No noise. It went into the clouds and that was the last I saw it. The Winds were easterly (clouds moving easterly) but the &#34;dot&#34; seemed like it was moving across the wind. I managed to get a photo.  Not sure if it&#39;s a weather balloon or ufo?  I tried to &#34;blow up&#34; the image but at 200 % just a blurry white dot. A military Helicopter had just passed below it heading south, this is what brought my attention to look skyward. I was in my backyard. It looked like it went into the cloud, but it may have been above the cloud.  Straight direction, steadfast in its course.  It was traveling faster than the clouds. Seems to me that if it were a weather balloon it would be traveling the same speed and direction as the cloud.  In the time from when I snapped the  photo to when it went into the cloud I could not get another photo.  It was traveling every bit as fast as the helicopter.  The whole incident probably took 15 seconds, seven seconds for me to go in get the camera off the coffee table, come out, find the object again, focus, snap the picture. Maybe 45 degrees of arc total.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I was a teacher in a small school and rented a house there.<n> <n><n> <n><n> One morning I woke up for school.  I can’t remember exactly which time it was , but I know it was between 6:30 and 7:10 AM there.  It was still dark.  I stepped outside to walk to the outhouse in my backyard and as I did so I happened to look up in the sky and  noticed something that seemed out of place there.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was a green ball of light, moving slowly in all directions (up and down, right and left).  It wasn’t just an insignificant spec in the sky but big and bright enough to have a true presence there.  I knew immediately that it wasn’t a shooting star, an airplane, a satellite, or a meteor because I had seen those things before and knew how they moved.  This object moved deliberately, covering wide distances in the sky in only seconds, as if somebody were moving a laser pointer dot all around on a blackboard.  Then it sped away and disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> That day I went to school and told colleagues about it.  These were Uzbek nationals.  One friend, a young woman my age who was my counterpart, was skeptical and treated me like I was crazy while my director told me had seen something similar years before.  I also told another friend whom I didn’t work with-- a young female teacher at a nursery school.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The next morning I woke up again around the same time and just like the morning before I stepped into my backyard on my way to outhouse and saw it again.  This time for only a split second before it sped away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Later that week the nursery school teacher I had told my story to told me that she had seen the same thing while outside at her house, only late in PM hours.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Months passed.  Later, in the Spring, my counterpart at school who had treated me like I was crazy when I told her my story apologized to me one day, and told me that she and her family had all witnessed the same object in the sky over the weekend, late at night.  Her sighting took place for an extended period of time and witnessed by more than at least three people  I have no opinion as to what this object was, only that it wasn’t normal and that it was definitely worth reporting.  Especially since it kept appearing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD))<n>

Weather was slightly overcast but with some gaps in the clouds. A bright reflection in the sky to my left caught my attention, like the sunlight reflecting off an airliner, but there was no sun to make this happen, and no aircraft in the sky. Almost an instant later the reflection or bright light seemed to shrink down to nothing and disappeared. Continuing to drive but still looking partly at the sky perplexed by what I had just seen I notice this huge &#34;image&#34; which was triangular in shape and seemed to be moving very slowly behind the clouds. It seemed to be transparent but I could clearly see it&#39;s shape. It didn&#39;t appear to have any lights on it but in each corner was either a single or a double round circle. I watched it at regular intervals (as often as I could safely look up while driving), I was getting nearer to it continuing to drive towards it as it passed over the motorway. This thing was huge, I know how big a large airliner seems in the sky and this was like 10 times bigger at least, and fairly low too and I thought surely there must be lots of people seeing this, but you would have had to have been looking up while driving to have spotted it and it was only the bright light that got my initial attention.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Eventually I passed it but at that time it seemed to enter thicker clouds and was less visible anyway.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Didn&#39;t see any reports in the press or TV about this.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

We looked immediately...it was circular but not flat like a &#34;flying saucer, almost slightly oval in shape. It made a sound like part of it was twirling, it had some goldish lights, some looked slightly tinted with red, but most were white...it appeared to almost have tailights or lights inthe back of it...the sky was cloudless and very dark making visibility very clear...it seemed to pass into the earths atmosphere and then disappear, perhaps leaving the earth&#39;s atmosphere. It was visible for about 4 -5 seconds heading north northwest. I could probably draw an illustration of what we saw, it was that clear and visible.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The light swooped down, leaving behind it a bright contrail, that quickly disappeared. As the light approached us, we saw that it&#39;s movement was erratic. It moved in a zig zag pattern, left to right. The light then accelerated and went straight up, leaving another misty-fog like contrail behind it. It never made a sound. My son had jumped out of the car when we first noticed it, as I had stopped the car to watch this event. The object must have been about a mile away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have seen other strange objects over the years, and have even reported some sightings on this sight, but this is probably the most significant event I have witnessed to date. the movement, the contrail, the acceleration. All of these were mind blowing.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I took out my binaculars and watched as they floated by and clearly saw a bubble like dome with a red pulsating to brighter orange light from with in the dome reflecting off a curved metallic shape body of the craft. Nothing earth shaking happen as they continued low and to the west like a flock of birds or butterflies and were gone in a minute or so.  I always wondered if there has been reports like this- or do we have helicopters totally quite?<n>

We took the back roads home, which took us through the northern part of Cumberland, RI.  My friend happened to look up inthe sky and noticed a strange shaped aircraft in the sky.  I looked up, and saw it was triangular in shape, with bright white lights at each of the three corners.  There was also a slightly larger white light directly in the center.  It really caught out attention not because of its shape, but because it wasn&#39;t moving... it seemed to just hover in place for awhile.  After watching it (and the road), it picked up a tremendous amount of speed in a relatively short amount of time - heading northward.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was only the one craft that we saw, and it didn&#39;t change shape, or release anything... nor did we experience any strange electrical or magnetic effects while driving.

Before reaching the tree line it &#34;turned off&#34; (for lack of better words)<n> <n><n> <n><n> We discussed this for at least 45 minutes, concluding that it was maybe 100 yards away, give or take, and that it didn&#39;t look like any meteor we&#39;d ever seen.

As it passed clouds, it did light them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As a side note, the one I saw on my own was in the same area, and had a similar appearance, but looked much closer, seemed to move horizontally, and went behind the trees instead of dissappearing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I really would hope that someone can either explain this light, or has also seen it.<n>

The incident occurred between 8:51 and 8:53pm Eastern Time.  The observers cannot be more precise about the time.  Friday, January 07, 2005.  The night sky at that time was cloudless.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There were two observers: ((name deleted/witness #1)), ((name deleted/witness #2)).  Dr. ((witness #1)) is a retired clinical psychologist and amateur astronomer.  Mr. ((witness #2)) is an ((deleted)) teacher with a ((deleted)) degree in education.  Neither have any history of UFO sightings, and Dr. ((witness #1)) describes himself as a &#34;UFO skeptic.&#34;<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object moved from East to West at a very high rate of speed, covering about 90 degrees of arc in about 10 seconds, when it was lost in the sky glow of the city to our west.  Its speed was constant but it clearly and distinctly changed directions (perhaps 30 degrees) two different times.  There was absolutely no sound associated with the object.  There were no aircraft in the vicinity at the time, and the aircraft seen that night were taking off from the west of the observers’ location, traveling east, and were all at low altitude, making them obvious.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object’s angular size was very small, subtending only about 3-6 minutes of arc.  It was clearly NOT an astronomical object of any type, as Dr. ((witness #1)) is an amateur astronomer and accustomed to looking at meteors, comets, nebulae, galaxies.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It contained no red lights, no green lights.  Mr. ((witness #2)) described it as having a &#34;color&#34; of dull orange-red.  Dr. ((witness #1)) could not discern any particular color other than a grayish hue.  It was only modestly luminous, similar to perhaps a 3-4th magnitude star, but was clearly larger than a point-source like a star.  It had a definite shape that was unlike an aircraft or a meteor.  It had a definite shape that was best described as a &#34;circle with a line through it.&#34;  It moved at a right angle to the &#34;line&#34; through the dot.  Dr. ((witness #1)) was not certain whether it emitted a dim light of its own or merely reflected light from the city below, but it was clearly NOT as bright as some of the brightest stars.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The observers are absolutely drawing no conclusions as to what the object was, but strongly agree that it was not a conventional aircraft, a meteor, or any natural phenomenon.<n>

It was a relatively clear evening in that part of Miami and we eventually turned our attention to the constellation of Taurus.  Sometime between 8:51-8:53 p.m. that evening, while viewing the constellation without the aid of the telescope, a moving object traveling through that section of sky caught my attention.  I have seen shooting stars and satellites before and this did not resemble either.  It was like no sky object I had seen before.  I made sure my friend’s attention was focused on the object as I asked him what he thought it could be.  It stayed visible for about 10 seconds as we discussed and tracked it in an east to west direction across the sky.  I dismissed the possibility that it was a plane since it moved much too swiftly, there was no engine sound, and had no noticeable navigational lighting.  My friend concurred.  It appeared to me to have what I describe as a dull, orange-red glow.  Its intensity and shape did not change as it passed over us.  It did, however, deviate slightly and rapidly from a straight line path two times before disappearing into the skyglow.  The object had a shape that was wider than it was long with a bulge in the center.  It traveled with the wider side oriented from north to south.<n>

These were to be it&#39;s final appearance nights from my vantage points in Southern Miami along Biscayne Bay. In fact, all shots were taken of the Southern view from my apartment terrace.  Take note that Turkey Nuclear power plant would be also due south of this vantage point.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am not sure what significance that would have on the objects I saw but I just wanted to mention that in this correspondence.  I have compiled a lot of the photos together after viewing them carefully. I didn&#39;t want to be mistaken about this.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On that night, of January 7, 2005, I was preparing to take photos of the comet with my two digital cameras. I had also set up my telescope in hopes of getting some real close shots. It was about 8 or 9 pm and I thought of just testing the cameras out before actually viewing with the telescope.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Without a flash, I proceeded to take several consecutive shots using all settings of SQ, HQ, and SHQ  to determine what would give me the best clarity of the moment. I also took shots with a flash as to bring in the buildings across the lake. This dark and light exposure would give me a perspective of distance. If the flash proved to be too bright to capture the comet and it&#39;s surrounding stars, I was going to refrain from that usage and just concentrate on keeping the camera as still as possible on the tripod and hope for the best.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As the results will show, I got more than I expected to. I downloaded the first set on to my computer to view and possible see if I caught the right detail of the comet. The shots without the flash were scanned and then I got to the pics that used a flash.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I saw something odd in the pictures. Some sort of cylindrical shapes were showing up. ODD...........I never saw that before and I have taken thousand of pics at the night sky. I have an Olympus program on my computer that enabled me to magnify, clarify, and view the objects at closer range. They appeared to be circular in shape with a distinct indentation at an angle of the sphere. Now where did I see that before.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The memory of the first Star Wars episode came to mind and I was thinking back of that same shape exhibited in the film. DEATHSTAR. Now that was real strange. As I continued to scan the photos, I saw that there was not one object but several, ranging in size from distant to close enough to touch. The flash of the camera must have reflected it&#39;s fast light on these objects and for some reason produced the image or should I say images.<n> <n><n> <n><n> All the photos I have included are original and without tampering of except for enhancement of the shots themselves. I needed some answers on this because to me it is just too unexplainable. As I researched further on the net, I found some comaparisons that are just too coincendtal. And then, not too long after these pictures were taken, an event of captured moons of Saturn..........was it Saturn or Jupiter?.......<n> <n><n> <n><n> Were shown on several sites and news pages of a moon that looked very similar to the shapes I had captured on that cool night in January.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I hope someone can clarify this data I am sending you. Have these objects been around all the time or have they just appeared for my benefit? Is there something going on (not again), that the human public is unaware of? And why are there so many? Usually a person can capture a UFO or whatever, and it&#39;s a single image of one object. Sometimes you might see two, three, or even four. But this many in one area of the sky. My sincere hope is just to get this information out to the people so they can decide for themselves and the experts can debate over what they really were.<n>

I saw some red lights and a white light in the trees ahead of me. As I drove up to these lights they were completely stationary making no noise, and i would say about 100 feet off the ground. I 100% thought these were radio towers or cell towers that someone one put up today. I completely stopped the vehicle and put my window down. As soon as I did this the object made a slight roaring noise and accelerated extremly quick to the north. As it flew north it gained altitude and speed untill I could no longer see it.  It had a steady red light on what I would call the front of the craft, a blinking red light on the tail of the craft and a steady white light on the bottom. I could not see the actual craft or its shape, but the orientation of the lights allowed me to make out front back and bottom.  Truly the oddest experience I have.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

This occured on the suburbs of the Kenyan city of Nairobi.  I then observed a seemingly orange colored flash (perhaps 2 seconds in duration) dissolving to a faint tail light moving away.  The movement appeared to be north wards.  Strangely enough, less than 30 seconds later, I saw this repeated at a slighly different position but quite close to the first flash.  I thought it might be two rocket stages following each other back into the earth&#39;s atmosphere.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

When bright lights in the sky caught my eye. At first I thought this might be a plane but, as I drove closer I realized it was stationary. My next thought was could it be a helicopter? No, as there was no sound from blades. As I got closer I could see that the object was Chevron in shape hovering about 150 feet above ground level. It had 2 very bright white lights positioned in it&#39;s center front section with no additional red or green lights. As I passed beneath the object I could see an orange/gold glow illuminating it&#39;s bottom surface. It appeared to be rather large I would estimate it at some 300 feet wide and 50 to 75 feet from front to back.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I spotted a flying object which I thought was a helicopter flying at about 1,000 feet elevation. It seemed to be gaining speed and as it neared my vicinity, I was trying to see the blades or the tail of the craft. It was about 1/2 mile away and at 1,000 feet. Thinking it was a helicopter, I thought that it must be on a heading for some crime that occured in our area. But, it didn&#39;t slow down. It was picking up speed and then turned northwest and as it did, I could see that it had no wings, tail, or blades. It was shaped like the front of a helicopter and on the back were 3 large round purple sphere. It made no noise and seemed to just glide along. Then, I thought it might be a weather balloon. But, the direction of the winds were easterly at 30 miles per hour due to a rain storm earlier in the am. It was heading against the direction of the wind. It gained altitude about 500 feet and maintained its speed north west. There was no jet trail, or sound of it moving. It was if it was scouting for something or sightseeing our city and the traffic.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I took several pictures with my throwaway camera. They have been developed and you can see a small object in the distance in each photo. But, because I used a cheap camera, anything more than a 1,000 feet away is just a spot.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I called the airport radar tower. They didn&#39;t want to say anthing about it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I called the paper, they just sd send an email and copy of the pic. Oh well, I did see other people in thier cars staring at it.

I even called someone from the car to go outside their house and look for it. If it was a plane, how did it stay in basicly the same place for 45 minutes. I was stuck in traffic and after I arrived at my friends house, we went inside and then left about 30 minutes later and it was still there except appeared to be farther away and a little lower in the sky. That made it still visible for over one and a half hours. That&#39;s not a plane. It is strange that my friend and I saw it on Friday night the 6th. If I had taken a picture while I was in traffic, it would have looked exactly like your photographs except when I first started noticing it the tails appeared to be in a slight &#34;V&#34;, not quite paralell. It kinda reminded me of the Hale-Bopp comet. I wish I had had my camera with me. It was not Venus! And stayed in view too long to be a plane. Even if it was on a long high route, I don&#39;t think that it would still be visible for 90 minutes!<n>

I had learned of the comet recently and knew it was bright enough to see without optical aids in a dark sky area and probably visible from most light-polluted areas.  I was pleasantly surprised to see the sky was pretty clear where I live, for it had been raining periodically for what seemed weeks and more rain was due to arrive.  There was plenty of moisture in the air causing the sky look terrible for star gazing; this I know because I am an amateur astronomer.  I grabbed a pair of 7 x 50 binoculars, knowing they would provide much aid in locating the comet under any conditions.  I had looked at a star map on the Internet earlier in the day and knew that I could easily find the right location to look because it would appear near the Pleiades star cluster.  Without using the binos I looked up and immediately saw Orion&#39;s belt and then used the bioculars to scan upwards from that point to pass what appeared to be Aldebaran, a bright star in Taurus, and then the Pleiades (which were not very apparent with the naked eye that evening).  As I moved around from Pleiades it only took a few seconds for me to notice a white, faint fuzz ball that I figured was probably the comet.  I only glanced at the object for a second before I decided to mark its position in relation to the other landmarks so I could verify that it was not just a deep sky object like a globular cluster.  I scanned upwards and located the Pleiades (very close to the supposed-comet) and then I started back down.  As I was going over some stars, something about them caught my attention.  I held the binos on an area of sky with what appeared to be quite a few remarkably similar stars close together.  As I was looking I thought I was moving the binoculars because it was a strain to look upwards at the very high angle that this part of the sky was in.  It turned out that I was moving the binoculars ever so slowly and that I was following these lights I had originally thought to be stars.  I was able to discern this because (after a mental double, no, triple-take) I saw the &#39;regular&#39; stars stationary in the background as these others moved across the sky.  Within a few seconds I counted 9 in my field of view (and recounted), it appeared to be 4 in one group and 5 in another group that were so close together they all could have been just one group of 9.  These lights appeared to me to be a whitish-yellow color; very much like a typical incandescent light bulb in color.  The shape of the light was hard for me to discern, but they could have been a small bar that was perpendicular to their direction of travel.  If it was a bar, the bar appeared to be dimmer on each end leading me to also believe they could have had brighter lights towards the middle of the bar and dimmer ones at the outer edge.  I couldn&#39;t be certain of the shape of the lights but I was absolutely certain that all 9 were identical.  And the best part of the whole story is that this &#39;formation&#39; of 9 lights did not stay in a static array.  The lights were moving amongst themselves changing the &#39;formation&#39; almost constantly.  It would be impossible for me to tell how far away they were, but if I guessed I would say if they were smaller objects they were probably about as high, and moving as fast, as a commercial jet.  If they were much larger objects I&#39;d say they were about as high, and moving as fast, as a standard orbiting satellite.  I watched them for about 2 minutes and that was long enough to see that they were getting slightly dimmer and slightly smaller as they headed in a southern direction.  The course never changed but the lights were moving among themselves almost constantly - not all of them at once, but maybe four or five being actively moving at any given time.  I put down the binos and went inside to tell my wife and that was that.  I would like to say that I&#39;ve spent hundreds of hours looking at the night sky with and without binoculars and telescopes and I also look at the sky during the day quite often.  It is incredible how many individual small balloons I&#39;ve pointed out to my wife as they traverse the sky, undoubtebly escapees from some poor child&#39;s clumsy grip.  I also have a habit of noticing aircraft and am particularly joyous when I see military craft as they fascinate me (and I&#39;m fairly good at determining what make they are).  I&#39;m very familiar with the sky and I would be very surprised if there are not at least a few more reports that mirror mine.  I knew that the closest Comet Machholz was going to get to Earth in its orbit was to occur on this particular evening.  Because of that and because of the proximity of my sighting to the comet, I am certain there were other eyes (trained ones, too) looking at that area at that time.  I guess I&#39;ll find out soon enough when I enter this site.  On another not, given my awareness of all environmental factors it would be easy for me to get a pretty close fix on the actual location (Right Ascension and Declination) of these objects by using a star map or planetarium program.  Also, I&#39;m checking the box here that says there were aircraft in the vicinity.  The sky here is very busy at this time of the evening but I didn&#39;t see any aircraft chasing the objects I saw. Clear Skies to all!<n>

I got up and walked towards the window to watch it. I was a large, green fireball. It moved horizontally but with a slight downward trajectory towards the earth. I thought it was a meteor and waited to see if there would be an explosion or the sound of fire trucks. I heard sirens and turned on the news but there were no reports in the media. I&#39;ve seen shooting stars but I&#39;ve never seen anything as large and green as this.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Me and my friends were in the front yard when this happened and it was early in the afternoon. I could feel as if whoever was in the craft was watching us. The object was large and quite frankly, VERY damned strange! It then travelled very, very slowly across a large cattle area that isn&#39;t too far from my house. The cattle were acting up and making noise as if something was bothering them. Then the craft stopped above the heard of cattle and turned and then it made a low deep humming noise. Then all of a sudden it just took off very fast to the west at a break neck speed! My friend Jason says that he saw something similar a week ago. It might be connected. I don&#39;t know what in the hell it was but I don&#39;t think it was from around here. We&#39;re not alone Peter!<n>

Neither are sure of the exact date but it appears to be sometime during the first week of January 2005.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Both were travelling on I-405 North (in separate cars) at approximately 6am in the morning. Around the 30th Street Exit (Kennydale) they saw a craft of some sort that seemed to be hovering over Lake Washington. My wife said that it seemed circular, and the lights were like nothing she had ever seen on an airplane. She had the very real feeling that she could possibly be seeing a UFO.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was still dark so no details of the craft could be determined other than the &#34;odd lights&#34;. Just tonight (1/27) my friend called and he wanted to tell me about something he saw in the sky. It turned out it was the same approximate time and place as my wife&#39;s sighting. Neither of them had known the other had seen something, let alone at the same time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My friend said that it was definitely circular and hovering. The lights were around the whole craft and &#34;Revolving&#34;. He knows what airplanes and helicopters look like, and this he said, was nothing like those. The revolving lights in a circular pattern was what really got - and kept - his attention. He said he kept his eye on it to the point that he almost hit the car in front of him. Approximate time of sighting lasted 2-3 minutes until he could no longer see it in his rear-view mirror.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;m interested to know if there are any other witnesses who saw this craft, or similar craft in this location and time-frame.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date is approximate.

It sounded as if it was down my street kind of the noise a plane would make i guess but more of a consistent humming noise it was very loud and seemed to keep getting louder and louder then stopping completely then about 2minutes later it would return. I guess I am the only witness i put 2 because my boyfriend could hear the sound on the phone. I was really quite scared at this time it didnt cross my mind that it would be a UFO or anything i was thinking more like a helpicopter crash landing at first but then when it stopped and came back again (it repeated this cycle about 3 or 4 times, i had no idea what it could be and i didnt dare look. It got quieter and seemed to be further away so i finally got the courage to go look out the window and i saw a really bright flash of light so i backed up from the window and ran out the room woke my parents up and told them what had happened, they thought i had been dreaming because i looked shocked as if id just has a nightmare. My boyfriend was still on the phone because id just left it on my bed while i looked and he said he had heard a high pitched machine like noise then heard me open my bedroom door so must have been when i ran out. When my parents went to check nothing was there i spent the rest of the night downstairs watching tv and havent heard/seen anything since. I asked my parents to ask the neighbours about it and they just asked are next door ones and they said they hadnt heard anything.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
1/4/05 23:20|Harrisburg|NC|Diamond|00:02:00|Extremely brilliant multi-colored symmetrical light source no sound hovering 1.5 minutes low in sky moving off at moderate velocity|1/11/05|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/041/S41387.html|218|ndxe200501| Extremely brilliant multi-colored symmetrical light source no sound hovering 1.5 minutes low in sky moving off at moderate velocity<n> <n><n> <n><n> At about 23:20 on 1/4/05 while watching television in a darkened room I observed a brilliant yet seemingly distant light through the french door onto our deck. I initially discounted it as a helicopter or other aircraft as our home is frequently overflown by the Carolinas Medical Center helicopter and commercial and private aircraft from the Charlotte-Douglas International Airport (25-miles south) and the Concord Regional Airport (8 miles North).  Approximately 1.5 hours before this sighting a single low flying (&lt;500 foot altitude) C-130 flew over at a rapid speed from east to west.  This overflight by C-130 military aircraft occurs on a limited frequency (4-6 times/year) always in the same direction.  This may be irrelevant but I thought it appropriate to include it.  After about 30 seconds the light became brighter and less distant prompting me to go out onto the back step.  The following is a description of what I observed:  In the WSW sky elevated at approximately 15 degrees from horizontal a radiant slightly pulsating symmetrical source of extremely brilliant light was visible. White, blue, green and yellow were the most noticeable colors of light emitted. The light was being emitted in all directions (object or light source appeared to have 3-dimensons). The axis of symmetry for the object was elongated along the vertical axis and compressed along the horizontal.  The light source seemed to stay in one position for about 1.5 minutes then moved off at a moderate velocity until no longer visible 30 seconds later. The size of the object at the distance viewed was approximately that of a Quarter held at arms length. No sounds of any sort were produced. No extraneous sounds from other sources (people, machines or animals) were noticed. It was very quiet.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Weather: Slightly cloudy (altocumulus clouds in western sky)unusually warm 60 Deg F no wind. Bottoms of clouds lighted slightly by city lights in distance.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Observer Location: Latitude 35 18&#39; 11&#34; N Longitude 080 37&#39; 20&#34; W   My Background: I am a 39 year old white male married with one child. I am a practicing Licensed Geologist in the state of North Carolina. I studied Engineering and Earth Sciences at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte Graduated in 1989.  I frequently telescope, search for satellites and meteor showers but have no particular interest in UFOs.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I was watching with binoculars and noticed that one light appeared to have a small pin point light orbiting it. Both lights were offset from eachother at a 45 degree angle. Both lights rose up then turned very sharp left in an instant, travelled left for a while then turned sharply upwards again. Not travelling at great speed but were faster than the average aircraft that were in the sky at the time. After rising again for a short distance the light on the left turned sharp left and down 45 degrees. the light on the right turned sharp right and up 45 degrees. The left light then turned horizontal left and then tuned very sharp right and up and at high speed and raced to the other light as if it was trying to catch it up. It reached the other light and they both travelled at the same rate horizontally right but a short distance apart. They both then turned sharply upwards and kept going up until they began to fade and i could no longer see them. The speed and angles they were moving could not be done by an aircraft. When they made their turns is was as if they were hitting a barrier of some sort and bouncing off. Aircraft turns make a sweep and this did not happen at any time.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

This object was a huge ball of light with a green tint.  It was falling at a very fast rate straight down.  First thought it was a shooting star or meteor but it was to big, bright and falling straight down really fast.  It was hard to tell the exact location but definitely towards the East, but the distance from our location was hard to differentiate.  After it fell it was to low to tell what had happened it went behind the tree line.  I would expect am impact crator or explosion on impact from the size and rate it was falling.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Whether they were eminating from one or two objects, I couldn&#39;t tell.  But both were &#34;falling&#34; very very rapidly, with the green light dimming low.  The white light remained and disappeared out of my sight behind the mountains to my right.  I suspected a fireworks or flare, but flares flicker or would leave smoke or trail.  What I witnessed looked bright and clear.  I also suspected a falling star, but what I saw was definitely in vicinity.  I can also rule out an airplane or helicopter, since this thing was traveling so quickly, seemingly at a lower altitude, I had never seen anything like it.  I am also quite sure that many of the commuters crawling up that freeway witnessed the same, since one of them actually popped out his head to look.

This light appeared to be a white, glittering (like a hand-held sparkler firework) spherical-shape and about twice the size of a basketball.  It was about 30 feet off the ground, and parallel to my window (on 2nd story of house), maybe two feet from my window.  I did not approach the window, but stared at the light from my position in the bed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This light was on the western side of the house, which sits at the crest of a hill and looks towards downtown Bellevue and Lake Washington, beyond that.  There are tall pine trees in the backyard, and the light was between a pine tree that is close to the house (maybe 10 feet from the window) and the window.  So, whatever this was, it had to maneuver around many trees to take up the location close to my window.   It made absolutely no sound, but was not menacing or frightening in any way.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The light suddenly disappeared after about 2 or 3 minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have since moved from that house, but lived there until 2007.  That light re-visited the same location at least three other times, always between 2am and 4am, between this first event in January 2005 and May 2007.<n> <n><n> <n><n> One daytime UFO event did occur at the same house, around 4pm on/about May 19th, 2005, when a round, small, red-orange orb floated across the sky, being chased by a seagull.  The gull would try to grasp it, and the object would move away from it. I observed them for  a few minutes, as they moved above adjacent yards, then, above mine, and eventually above our cul-de-sac.  They were maybe 50 feet above the ground.  The orb was reddish-orange, and had a non-reflective, matte, surface. It had darker, circular spots on it.  I initially thought it might be an escaped red party balloon, but it was too round, and did not appear to have a valve/place where air would have been put into it and no tie, no string, no irregularity to the roundness.  It was about the size of a basketball.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Suddenly, both the gull and red orb disappeared, in the middle of a large open area above our street. I thought I must have blinked and they changed direction and headed behind some trees, but they could not have traversed the distance to the trees in a heartbeat, and I did not see them beyond or between the trees.  This frightened me so much, I went indoors and went up to the second story to look out the window for them, for awhile, but never saw them again. They truly just seemed to have vanished!<n>

I was outside smoking a cigarette, and through the trees above my neighbors house a light/fireball looking object appeared.  It was about the size of a street light but was quite a distance away.  It was a much bigger light than any plane, and stayed in the same spot the whole time while other planes flew in various different areas of the sky.  It was also higher in the sky than any streetlight, and above a large forest area, so it was definately no ordinary aircraft.  While watching it, the object would dim and brighten randomlly.  At one point, another object that appeared to be the same type showed up next to it.  That object disappeared but the first object stayed.  At that time I went inside to get some binoculars and I told my brother to come with me.  When I looked at the object, it seemed to be 2-3 lights.  They were amber or orange in color.  Right after my brother came out, the object seemed to dim and just went out completely.  We watched for a few more minutes but it was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

As we moved toward our destination the formation seemed to follow us and hover above our vechicle. At this point, we felt as if we were being followed. We entered our garage and looked out the window viewing it above our neighbors home which still had exterior lights on. At this point we shut off all our lights and contiued to watch this unidentified object hovering in the same location.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous.

1/2/05 17:18|Seattle|WA|Light|3-4 minutes|white light similar to satellite traveling high over Seattle|1/11/05|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/041/S41362.html|233|ndxe200501| white light similar to satellite traveling high over Seattle<n> <n><n> <n><n> At about 5:17 this evening I was on my deck and as always looking up at the sky to see what was there.  It was just getting dark and the stars were starting to show up, (the brightest ones first of course), were all I could see at this time.  So, right by the star Capella, I believe, in the constellation of Auriga, there was a rather bright light appearing to be the same size and brightness of that star (Capella) traveling in a East, Southest direction, at a fairly slow speed.  At first my thoughts were that it was a Satellite~ and it could have been I guess, however it didn&#39;t seem to act like any satellite I&#39;ve seen before.  First of all, it was for sure not a plane! There were no blinking lights on this object,just a white light, like a star.  Usually satellites disappear quite quickly and sometimes even flash as if in rotation and reflecting light as they rotate, but this light stayed the same intensity the whole time I observed it.  I actually ran into the house and grabbed my binoculars and ran back out and still found it moving in the same general direction without the binocs!  So I followed it with the binoculars for a couple more minutes until it faded and finally disappeared, which was fairly close to the horizon /Cascade Mountains.  It also did seem to speed up and change direction of its course although this was not real apparent, not like rapid changing or sharp angled turns. Just a sort of veering into a more southerly direction and speeding up slightly.  It also didn&#39;t seem to be as high as a satellite usually travels.  That is about it, nothing overly exciting but I thought it was worth writing in about.  I&#39;m wondering if anyone else saw it and might of reported it also.  I&#39;d be interested to know if you think it was a satellite.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thanks, DC<n>

We were taking the backroads near a small, local airport.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As we were driving, I looked towards the mountains, and for about a second, I saw a bright green light streek from the sky into the trees. It gave off a long, green trail, which lasted for less than a second after the object disapeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I don&#39;t think it could have been a plane, because I would have seen a fire from where I was when it crashed, it would have been on the news, and planes aren&#39;t glowing green.

I don&#39;t think it could have been a flair or other object dropped from an aircraft, because It was going to fast and I did not see any other objects in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We do not live by any military installation or research centers.

My apartment is on the 13th floor. Between the tall buildings, over the Puget Sound, I saw a stationary, pulsating light that changed color from blue-white to red, yellow, and green. I awoke my partner and she also saw the object. At one point a smaller white light seemed to emerge from the bottom of the craft, but it disappeared immediately. With binoculars we could make out the colors better, but could not discern a shape to the object. I took several pictures with both digital and film cameras. If the photos show anything I will submit them to this site. After watching the lights for about 20 minutes, I noticed a second craft to the west of the original one. It was identical in appearance, with pulsating blue-white, red, yellow, and green lights. The lights on the two objects did not appear to pulse in unison. The second craft also appeared to hover without motion over the Sound, perhaps a mile or so from the first. The first craft was lower in the sky than the second, not very high in the air. At 4:24 AM, the first craft slowly disappeared behind a building after arcing downward toward the west. The other craft remained stationary and I finally fell asleep.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My partner and I are professional women in our 30s.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was New Years day and I had heard a few fireworks earlier that evening, but considering the date everything was quiet.  The sky was mostly cloudy, but with areas where stars could be seen clearly.  I was walking down the street in an Easterly direction looking up at the stars when I saw a white light traverse the sky, approximately  from south to north.  There was no object visible just light, illuminating the cloud cover from behind.  The light moved very fast, in a straight line across the sky in about one second.  If I had not been looking up I would never have seen it.  At first I thought it might have been from a search-light, like auto dealers sometimes use, but the movement was too fast crossing, the sky in one direction only and with no visible beam projected from the ground.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I continued watching the area, and within less than a minute the light appeared again, from the same approximate point in the South following a streight course to the North.  Again I continued to watch, ane within less than a minute I saw the light again a third time, on the same course and speed.  I watched a little longer, but didn&#39;t see anything more so I continued my dog walking.  As I apprached the end of the street, at a slightly different heading, I looked back again at the sky and saw a forth light, traveling the same path as the other three. I then returned home.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I stated, there was no visible object with any of these four light sources.  Rather the light appeared to be projected from behind the clouds onto the surface.  The lights appeared rectangular, with rounded corners, dimensionally the length appeared to be about three times the width, although this could have been an illusion caused by the speed the lights moved.  Ther was no sound associated with this incident what so ever.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

At first I mistook it for a plane flying towards us but it was a bit brighter and maybe a bit larger (lower?) than the other planes in the area at the time, and it was missing the usual red and green blinking marker ligthts. Besides, it should have grown larger and eventually flown overhead if it really were moving in our direction. This object was apparently stationary.  I brought it to my boyfriend&#39;s attention and as we were watching it, the lights quickly dimmed (within approximately  a second)and the object seemed to disappear. There were very few light clouds and it was still light out and the object was definitely no longer there.  My boyfriend said that he could see a dark patch against the sky where it was for a couple of seconds before that also disapeared completely but I can&#39;t confirm this because I had to revert my attention to the road ahead. I did look up again a minute later there was still nothing where it should have been or around that area. I was wondering if anyone else in the area saw anything.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

But as the airliner flew by them they suddenly took off toward the southwest in formationn---and at a hight rate of speed. Then they separated from the formation, flew apart for a while, then resumed close formation and disappeared beyond the horizon. Changes of speed and direction were unusually abrupt.

The light seemed to be getting closer. As I looked closer I called out the other people in my home to see the odd lights. by the time everyone came out the lights had floated very close to us . They all seemed to be headed in the same direction. As they passed overhead it seembed that some embers seemed to fall to the ground and shortly later the lights faded in the distance and they dissapeared. I went inside to get my video camera and when I came back their was two more lights headed in the same pattern. I started videoing the phenomenon and one of the lights floated directly overhead not more than a hundred feet above us. My wife and friends said the light was at the base of the object and the rest of the shape was translucent kinda like a tapered rectangle with a round base. As it passed over my friend yelled out to the object to see if it was someone parachuting at night. The object passed over our house and crossed over the street. It looked like it was going to land. We took off after it in my truck but could not find it.But we do have a video of the whole thing.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

They were first noticed over the near-north side of the city, passing over downtown, until out of sight.  All 3 objects were the same color.  They did not appear to be emitting any light of their own, but possibly reflecting the light of the city.  The color of the objects was a muted pinkish hue, about the same color as the haze on the horrizon glowing from the city lights.  For this reason, I first thought the objects were clouds or smoke from New Year&#39;s Eve fireworks, but then I realized that the sky was perfectly clear, and 2 of the objects were changing shape in what appeared to be a controlled movement.  There was one object that appeared to be flying signifcantly higher than the other 2.  This object did not change shape.  It appeared to have wings, and looked like it could have been an aircraft, but it&#39;s shape was unlike any civilian aircraft I have seen.  The other 2 objects appeared to be lower than the first.  They followed the same path as the object above them.  These 2 objects were amorphous.  They were somewhat tubular and long, and kept twisting and contorting themselves, moving towards each other and back away, at times meeting with each other to form new shapes.  They were not moving very fast.  They were in view for about 1.5 to 2 minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

We went upstairs to take a peek at the disneyland and knott&#39;s berry farm firework displays when something catches my eye. At first i thought it was plane passing over but then it stopped and seemed like it was hovering really really high. Then a plane passes by and that&#39;s when i knew it wasn&#39;t a plane. It had a redish-yellowish-orange color to it. Seem like it was a rotating light. Was weird beacuse uually under the city lights you don&#39;t get to see much space events like the stars so it had to be a really bright object. It brought back memories when I saw a similar object about 2 years ago that appeared in the sky and changed colors then disappeared. The recent one was similar to it but moved around more. It would move then stop then move and stop again then it just disappeared. We looked around in the sky searching for it when we saw another one in more towards the north-eastern sky. It was just like the one before and a plane passes by their (planes going to LAX) and the object stops. Moves around a little and change colors to bright yellow to red to orange. It seemed like it got closer but then zoom back then just hover and then disappeared a couple minutes later. I got these suspicious lights on my camcorder. Tried the besti could to get some good footage but im not a pro. The video i took u can distinguish the color of it and a really bright light. I just wanted to know what this object/s are.

1/1/05 00:05|Las Vegas|NV|Oval|5 seconds|I had never seen such speed of an object up on the sky.|1/11/05|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/041/S41368.html|254|ndxe200501| I had never seen such speed of an object up on the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As New Year&#39;s count-down was done on TV, I went outside the balcony and noticed the sky had cleared and several commercial airplanes were flying around, then as I was about to go inside the condo, I noticed two flying oval silver-glowing shaped spheres. They seemed like they were traveling together, one just below the other one, at great speed &amp; for a second they stopped blinked for a fraction of a second and kept going by the time I had gone to the front door to see to what direction they were heading, the spheres were gone!<n>

1/1/05 00:00|Baltimore|MD|Circle|not sure|Experiences worth reading|7/5/05|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/044/S44744.html|256|ndxe200501| Experiences worth reading<n> <n><n> <n><n> Hello I just found this site and will be sure to add to my favorites.Im not good at wording my experience&#39;s, but I will do the best I can.  I recently have not scene a UFO but I have had experiences in the past worth wording.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In the late 60&#39;s  Im thinking 1969 I would of been 8 standing in our front yard in Mt Washinton Maryland with my father,mother and next older brother we saw what looked like a cigar shaped balloon with what we thought was a person on a bicycle making a propeller move this craft.It was not too far away..less than a quarter mile,but we kind of had trouble making it out.It was not a plane and now I realize this was not a bicycle powered balloon either.Next years later age 13? I found myself outside my house in Towson Maryland in my underware at around 4am wondering why Im out here..I never have had a problem with sleep walking...nothing strang seemed like it had happened. Many years later 35 now I was living at a friends house in Mt washington Maryland ...my room in the basement I may have been abducted I cant tell if it was a dream or did it really happen? Im not sure but for some reason I keep recalling a very brite light like if head lights were shining in the sliding glass door in the room I was sleeping in. I think I came to in the backyard at the same time as seeing 2 dark saucers darting away over the tree tops.I went right back in and went to sleep but I felt like I had been through some trauma.It didnt seem like a big deal at that time but that dream or whatever it was keeps coming back to me.Sometime after that I developed an anal fissure which doctors thought were hemroids for the longest time...could this fissure be from a alien exam? Other strange things are the humming in my  right ear or right side of my head which started around 2/2000 that no doctor seems to have a anwser or solution for..it comes and goes and I havent had the humming for around a year now..maybe a few brief times since.Its more like an electrical hum from a large transformer.Lastly I have an obsession for ufo&#39;s and anwsers,I found out Im really good at algebra and math in general..I didnt even carry a notebook my last year of high school ..they wanted me gone..lol I was in the cop out program my last 2 yrs of high school.I did finish college with a degree in computer networking though 2002.I always have thoughts like I may have been programed or Im being monitored.If anyone else has simular experiences or you have some possible anwsers let me know. Thanks<n>
1/1/05 00:00|North Hollywood|CA|Formation|21 minutes|I witnessed a UFO dogfight.  ((NUFORC Note:  Probably not a serious report.  PD))|2/8/05|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/041/S41655.html|257|ndxe200501| I witnessed a UFO dogfight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was coming back home from church after New Year&#39;s Service. I was on the S-101 Freeway. My car was the only vehicle on the freeway at the time. Suddenly, mr car stopped. I stepped out and looked around to see if anyone could give me a jumpstart. Suddenly, I heard weird pinging sounds. I looked up and saw three saucers zipping through. There were green trails where the aircrafts had flown by. They were in a tight triangular formation. Suddenly, four or five more saucers in loose formation shot out from the clouds after the previous UFOs (which I think they were). Suddenly, a light shot out from one of the pursuiting crafts after the ones that had previously zipped by. It hit one, and it instantly blew up. When the green phosphorous light caused by what I think was a missile cleared, there was no more light there. From the rear, more missiles shot out. One of the lead UFOs took a sharp banking turn (the light started dimming, which I think means he turned away) and the missile just continued on its path. The other one took a critical hit, and the same thing happened. There was nothing else. The four or five planes in the back seemed to have disappeared because it didn&#39;t glow anymore, but later, I saw flashing lights, which I think were indicator lights. Therefore, I concluded that only the first three planes were UFOs.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous.  PD))<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((MESSAGE FROM NUFORC VISITOR))<n> <n><n> <n><n> I got to say, that in the past I have been very impressed by the integrity of your reports.  However, having only glanced through the January reports, I read TWO that were obviously hoaxes: (1/15/05) Las Vegas, and the dancing disco balls!, plus (1/1/05) North Hollywood writer states he/she witnessed a UFO dogfight!  Come on!  Please screen you emails a little better.  You have an AMAZING website, and your standards are usually top notch.  Thank you for the hard work.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((END))<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We agree with the visitor to our site, and we have amended both reports, labeling them as probably not serious ones.  We express our gratitude to the reader for his having called this to our attention.  PD))<n>
