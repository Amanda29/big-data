11/30/09 22:15|Gardnerville|NV|Unknown|continuous|Noticed flashing lights out my kitchen window along with beams of light , projectiles and meteors falling near by.  ((Sirius??))|12/12/09|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/073/S73534.html|2|ndxe200911| Noticed flashing lights out my kitchen window along with beams of light , projectiles and meteors falling near by<n> <n><n> <n><n> After drinking some orange juice before bed I noticed a cluster of changing lights(red,green,blue,yellow and white) in the distance to the east through the window.  Upon closer examination I realized I was looking at something other than a star or aircraft.  It was moving in a diamond pattern then stopping and staying stationary, emitting bright beams of light and what appeared to be projectiles that left a copper colored sparkle trail until they faded.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I dressed myself, grabbed the video camera and exited to the outside when I noticed what looked like meteors falling extremely close to said cluster of changing lights.  At this time I am monitoring every fifteen to 20 minutes to see if there is any changes.  So far it has gained more altitude.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Probable sighting of Sirius.

11/30/09 21:00|Tucson|AZ|Triangle|:20 min|Saw what appeared to be stars shooting "laser" lights down, also an object emitting other objects in to another|4/13/10|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/074/S74513.html|3|ndxe200911| Saw what appeared to be stars shooting &#34;laser&#34; lights down, also an object emitting other objects in to another<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have seen the same things in the sky for over a year.  One night my dog  was extremely anxious and began to bark angrily and excessively at the back door. I was reluctant to get up and let her out as she had just been out. I had gotten off work late and was eating dinner at the table, my dog was going crazy (like when someone knocks on the door) I finally got up and took her out, she ran out with the hair on her back standing up. When I got outside to take a look around I looked and saw what I thought was the police chopper, It was a large light hovering pretty low. I went back inside to finish my dinner, however my dog continued to be very upset, so I went back outside to physically carry her back inside. When I went outside I stopped and watched what I originally thought was a police chopper, and as I watched I realized it was something else. The light seemed to grow in size and it shot a smaller &#34;star&#34; out and that star shot out and we watched it glide across the sky, ! it shot north and we watched it until we could no longer see it. It also appeared to have what looked like a streak of grey afterburner smoke under it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Naturally I called everyone I knew to tell them about what I had seen, my brother suggested that I keep my cell phone on me and try to get a picture of it, if it happened again. I decided that was a good idea. I never thought I would see anything like that again, however the next day I had my phone in my pocket, and my dog began to bark excitedly again. I ran outside and looked up and around for a while, then right above me  I spotted a red laser looking thing shooting out of what I thought was a star. At first I thought it was my imagination, but I put my cell phone on video and held my arm up for about half an hour and suddenly I actually saw it again and got it video taped on my cell phone. After that point in the days to come my dog continued to bark excitedly and sure enough when I go outside if I look up in the general direction where she is barking, I almost always get a shot of a &#34;star&#34; shooting a laser usually white sometimes blue and red only twice.  It  has been a! year and I probably have around 60 videos of these things. I can only surmise that they make a sound that we cannot hear but that my dog can hear. Aside from the &#34;stars that  shoot lasers, we also have videos of what looks like 5-6 &#34;stars&#34; and suddenly one &#34;star&#34; like light comes out of the bottom of one &#34;star&#34; and slowly goes up in to another. I keep referring to  the word &#34;star&#34; because if you do not know what you are looking for they just look like stars. It&#39;s my dog that hears or senses something that alerts me to something strange up there. Often times there are three &#34;stars&#34; in the shape of a triangle out there and the two bottom stars of the triangle shoot lasers.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I  have been hesitant to report anything because I don&#39;t want to be classified as a crazy person, however I need to report to someone, I know what I have seen and what I have on video.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I live in a town where there is a military base, and I sometimes wonder if they are experimenting with something, but I am tired of seeing things, I am tired of my dog getting so upset and I just want to know what these things are. Can you help?<n>
11/30/09 20:51|Alamogordo|NM|Sphere|7 min|Bright Orange Orb traveled fairly quickly  across sky  then  hovered briefly and shot straight up.|12/12/09|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/073/S73530.html|4|ndxe200911| Bright Orange Orb traveled fairly quickly  across sky  then  hovered briefly and shot straight up.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Possible UFO Sighting  Alamogordo New Mexico  On November 30th at 2051 Local time (As verified with my Atomic Watch) at my residence in Alamogordo New Mexico, I happened to step outside to check on the weather conditions.  Snow was forecasted for the evening. The weather was overcast with slight rain/sleet.  As I walked around to my drive way I happened on a Bright Orange Light in the night sky.  The object was North by East in direction. I wondered if it could be a meteorite. The object appeared to be travelling horizontally for a few minutes in a westerly direction.  I did not notice any flashing marker lights as usually seen by nearby Military and civilian traffic. There was no trail as found with meteorites. The bright object was below the cloud cover at this time.  I decided to go inside my house and get my wife and get my 8 X 40mm Tasco binoculars.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At 2055 the object stopped in mid air just north of my residence.  The object was hovering at this point and my wife was observing it with the binoculars.  At this time the object was just above the cloud cover.  At 2057 my wife went inside the house due to the cold and to attend to our kids.  I continued to observe this object for another minute and it appeared to gradually lose its orange brightness and slowly fade.  It appeared at this time to be going straight up and in a matter of about three seconds disappeared completely. I looked at my watch and noted the time to be 2058.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The Orbs brightness was brighter than any aircraft I have witnessed in my 22 years in the U.S. Air Force.  The brightness was equivalent to it being on fire.  I observed the object before it ascended above the cloud cover with the binoculars.  I did notice a variety of red almost pink colors toward the rear of the orb.  No sound was heard. No other aircraft in the sky were visible.  This was a very eerie experience.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I then contemplated calling the local Base (Holloman AFB) to report what I had seen.  Being a retired Air Force member myself, I realized this would be a waste of time.  Who do you call at now 2110 at night??  I talked with my wife who is a complete skeptic on the subjects of UFOs.  She mentioned to look for a web site that takes reports of sightings.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I contacted the National UFO Reporting Center by phone and was instructed to file a detailed report.<n>
11/30/09 19:30|Cumberland to Freeport area|ME|Other|30 minutes|Observed two lights hovering and then moving south south East over the coast of Maine at approx Freeport , for 30 minutes|12/12/09|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/073/S73573.html|5|ndxe200911| Observed two lights hovering and then moving south south East over the coast of Maine at approx Freeport , for 30 minutes<n> <n><n> <n><n> traveling north on I 295 near Cumberland, Maine, I observed two bright lights (orb shaped) hovering over the coastline over an area between Brunswick and Freeport Maine.  The lights hovered for about ten minutes and then began to move south south east along the coast towards Yarmouth (in my direction) and Portland.  I pulled over and looked at them with a pair of field glasaes and saw what looked like three landing lights (I am a lic pilot with over 1200hrs) in a row * * *.  At first the lights were about 20 to 25 deg above the horizon and about 15 deg apart.  They kept the distance between them at all times.  I continued to watch for a total of 30 minutes, they stayed the &#34;same&#34; intensity color etc at all times.  The lights were white with no colors.  At no time did I observe &#34;strobes&#34; such as aircraft anticollision lights or position lights of red or green.  When I drove off northbound, the lights had not reached the 90 deg position yet but were still movi! ng slowly down the coastline.  I was unable to est the size without knowing just how far away they were.  I was able to view them in my mirrors for about two minutes after driving off.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

11/29/09 23:59|Burnsville|MN|Chevron|20 minutes|Orbiting light spheres and gold lights in boomerang shape|12/12/09|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/073/S73527.html|7|ndxe200911| Orbiting light spheres and gold lights in boomerang shape<n> <n><n> <n><n> I went out on my deck,which overlooks 1+ acres of woods in sunurb of Burnsville, off Burnsville Pkwy and Cty Rd 5 at about midnight.  Between the treetops and above, clear sky view, I spotted 2 large orbs of white light, rapidly circling each other in a large circle, about the size of a football field.  The sky was completely covered by dense clouds and the light circles were quite visible.  They never waivered from their distance from eachother, but did move sideways from time to time.  It resembled a planet with an orbiting planet....not an irregular path.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I watched for several minutes and then started to take photographs with my digital camera and flash.  I could see nothing in the view window after they were taken, but kept shooting.  Suddenly, several gold orbs or lights appeared in an arc shape, appearing to flash or move.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then the clouds completely went away, revealing a totally clear sky with lots of stars.  In an instant, the lights just vanished.  One of the photos I have sent has been lightened and set to very high contrast, to show the area was above the treetops.  No city lights, just sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first, I thought it might be advertising beams shooting into the air, but it started at midnight and there were no beams back to earth.  I called the police and they had no reports and no knowledge of any promotional beamed lighting in the area.  I thought it might be northern lights or lightening, but it had a very set and regular pattern path.  The gold lights were not visible to the naked eye when there was cloud cover,but the early photos showed them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness corrected date to November 29.  PD))<n>

11/29/09 11:44|Augadillla (Puerto Rico)||Disk|Seconds|Digital photo of a cylindrical object in the sky in Aguadilla PR.|2/14/10|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/074/S74214.html|9|ndxe200911| Digital photo of a cylindrical object in the sky in Aguadilla PR.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The pictures in question were taken from a cliff overlooking a beach area near the CG Air Station in Aguadilla PR, at the time that the pictures were taken we did not notice any objects in the sky.  But when we went through our pictures we noticed that one out of the three pictures taken within a six second fragment, one was showing this cylindrical object in the sky.  At the area we took the picture we did not see anybody flying a kite or playing with model planes etc.  We were very curious to know if this could be a UFO sighting.<n>
11/28/09 22:52|Petersburg|IL|Triangle|10-15 seconds|3 orange lights fly over petersburg Illinois|12/12/09|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/073/S73521.html|10|ndxe200911| 3 orange lights fly over petersburg Illinois<n> <n><n> <n><n> At about 10:52 PM in Downtown Petersburg, Illinois I and 3 other witnesses all saw the same UFO flying overhead.  It covered about 50 degrees of the sky in no more than 10 seconds.  It was triangular in shape with an orange glowing light on each point of the triangle.  It had absolutely no sound as it passed through the sky.  During the time it was flying overhead my friends and I were able to determine that it was nothing man made.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It passed overhead from a direction of Northwest and flew southeast until we couldn’t see it due to light pollution of fast food signs.  The lights at first made me think that it was a collection of birds, but upon realizing that they were all too uniformly spaced to be anything of the sort.  It was amazing how fast it was flying because right after we looked a plane and it appeared to be going at least 10 times faster than the plane.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The size in comparison to the moon was about 3 moons in the area of a triangle.  The area between the three lights blocked out the stars behind it.  It was like nothing I have ever seen in my life. There is no other way to explain it.  It was a large triangle shaped craft of some sort that moved swiftly through the sky and made absolutely no sound.<n>

It was a pretty moonlit night. We were all looking at the stars and then one person declares, &#34;Oh my God!&#34;<n> <n><n> <n><n> In the sky, we see three circles, a brownish orange in color, flying from the north-west. The were in a triangular formation, flying equidistant from each other. In between the circles was black and whenever it passed a star, you were not able to see the stars. It was also noiseless.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It lasted for around ten seconds before it disappeared in the south-east direction.<n>
11/28/09 22:50|Petersburg|IL|Triangle|10 seconds|Black, triangular UFO over a small central Illinois town.|12/12/09|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/073/S73519.html|12|ndxe200911| Black, triangular UFO over a small central Illinois town.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Three of my friends and I were sitting outside on the trampoline in my backyard. We live downtown in Petersburg, IL. It&#39;s a very small town, but there are enough nearby shops and streetlights that light pollution can be fairly bad. Nevertheless, we are usually able to see stars and such, which makes stargazing on clear days (like this) one of our favorite pastimes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was just past 10:50 p.m. when my friend started pointing northwest in the sky and yelling &#34;What is that?!&#34; We all looked up and noticed three brownish objects gliding through the sky, forming a perfect triangle. For a second, I thought they might be birds, but they were way too still and uniformly spaced. They were also way to low, dimly lit, and fast to be any sort of aircraft I know. The triangle itself blended with the sky behind it, but my friend said he would see the stars behind it disappearing when the triangle passed under them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It took maybe five, ten seconds to completely pass across the sky, and it was completely noiseless. My friends and I were amazed. A few minutes after it passed, I remembered the air force base about 30 minutes (by car) southeast of us - the direction that the Unidentified Flying Object was headed. I&#39;m still looking to hear if anybody else noted these same sightings.<n>

At first I thought it was the international space station but there was two of them. One was following the other. The one in back was a little bit smaller than the one in front. They was very close to each other.There was no sound and no lights were flashing to indicate an aircraft of some kind. I watched them as they went behind some trees and one came out and the other didn&#39;t. The one continued on toward the s/se until I could not see it anymore.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
11/28/09 10:30|Abu Dhabi (UAE)||Changing|15min|weird experience|12/12/09|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/073/S73524.html|15|ndxe200911| weird experience<n> <n><n> <n><n> i was driving to al ain (135km away from Abu Dhabi) on my road i stop at my car for a break, main reason was i was bored becoz my radio simply stop playing just weird tune. I pull over in the side, i had my camera with me so i took few pictures of the desert. there was this fence to keep out civilians from the desert(weird ) but i jumped the fence to take few picture started walking in the sand mount. weather was not that hot suddenly i spotted something, first i thought its a plane then i saw this thing moving so fast and stop at once in middle. it came closer to me  i couldn&#39;t move my body my camera was still in my hands but i couldn&#39;t move anything my head and eyes were like fixed on it. it came bit more closer, it was a round shape, there was no window, it had a sand colour it was like 50feet away from me it was bigger than a attack helicopter. i went on my knee becoz i couldn&#39;t stand this things was spinning and i felt like some waves or something hit m! e ...i fall down, when i stand up i had bad headache. I saw it moved then suddenly this circle turn into a triangle model, then slowly started moving ...i still couldn&#39;t move my hand or body but as i look it gone far away from me i started moving then i took the camera and take few short but it was gone. since then i got headache, having really weird dream in which i see strange shapes(circles, triangle,then something like visualisation abt strange waves of shapes changing) numbers(i hates maths to be honest) this numbers form some of the weird equations(or something like that form) then a place where place were big clouds and explosions happening (guess its in space) and finally strange circles connected to each others(like in a watch the mechanical wheel) moving clockwise. I see that the same date since then i saw the same thing again and again. so kind of scared to sleep, i didn&#39;t said anything to anyone all i want is just stop this headache and dreams. one more strange ! things is that when i meet people,animals, trees i some how se! nse what they are feeling(not their thoughts or not what they think). when i touch a tree i feel it or humans ...and since then i&#39;m having difficulty understanding it. I met people and few times i cried becoz i felt their pain..it all weird just want all this to stop and i want my normal life.other time i get happy other time i get sad its all related to person i meet..so right now i have no idea what im feeling. i take few days off and sitting inside my room and not seeing anyone. had medicine taken but still i dunno its there its been  only three days and i already feeling like i will loose my mind<n>

I couldn&#39;t stop staring at it, I had never seen any kind of aircraft in my life. it was triangular shaped with lights,.. didn&#39;t make a noise.

It would sometimes flash the lights in sequences but no discernable repition was viewed. The lights were not arranged in any pattern that one would expect to see on any U.S. registered aircraft, nor did they have the correct colors or sequences. It did not move like any aircraft I have ever seen. The object floated in one spot then would move one direction in a slow but steady manner and reverse direction, almost impreceptably but very definitlety. After about 20min it descended in at a steady rate that appeared to be very controlled. Before it faded from view it changed direction in the same fashion it did previously but to a smaller degree then flashed a very bright red/white righ! t before disappearing from view.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Before passing Longwood Gardens on the way to Oxford, Pa, I witnessed a large, bright shape in sky to my southwest.  It was blue, white, yellow &amp; green. It had a white tail, like a shooting star.  It was almost like the Girl Scout symbol in shape.  I know, since the road was crowded, others saw the same thing.  It didn&#39;t seem to be documented on the news or in print.<n>

I noticed it was lighter than usual outside, but dismissed it as me not being a morning person.  My dog would not stop making that low sound so at 5:40 I got up to put her and my other dog, outside.  By then, the brightness from outside was gone.   My patio door faces North and it was clear outside except a very few horizon clouds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I got to the patio door I noticed a really bright &#39;star or Venus&#39; in the sky.  It seemed strange because I have never seen &#39;Venus&#39; so high in the sky, nor a &#39;star&#39; so bright.  The light was stationary, very bright and twinkling two different pulses.  I looked at it for about 8 seconds.  When opening the patio door, I looked down for about 5-6 seconds or so to keep the cat from getting out; as I closed the door, I looked back at &#39;Venus&#39;, however, it had moved visually 5 feet over to the West, and 2 feet to the North!  I know it was in a different position because when I first saw it I compared the position in the sky to the  plant on my patio railing.  I looked at it for another 10 seconds or so to determine that it was definitely stationary in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I closed the curtain, because my dogs will stare in the patio door instead of doing their business, and went over to a window on the same wall and two feet over from the patio door (taking about 2 seconds to do that).  I could not see the light anymore.  There are no large objects on my patio which would block out the area where I saw the light, in fact I have a very clear view of the sky from the entire North side of my house.  I got right up to the window searching for the light all over the sky and horizon.  Did not see anything but a few regular stars.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About 3 minutes later I let my dogs in and saw the light further down on the horizon, just above the clouds and more toward the West visually about 1 foot above the horizon, above the town water tank.   I had looked in that area minutes before and did not see it there.  It appeared further away because it was about 3/4 the size as when I first saw it.  I went outside stood there for approx. 5 minutes watching it.  Getting cold, I went inside and watched it for 45 minutes.  I watched the light stay in exactly one position, still very bright and still twinkling 2 different pulses.  There were tiny flashing lights that would pop up all around the sky near the light at different times, about 8- 10 of them.  At one time a cloud passed in front of it, but it was still there once the cloud moved.  The clouds slowly went away, and now it was completely clear.  After 45 minutes,I walked over to grab a chair to sit in to watch it, when I returned seconds later, the light was gone.  I ! right away started to e-mail my Mother, when I noticed my computer was 2 hours off.  I had not been that way the night before because I always check the time while I am e-mailing someone.  What was strange about it was that the light would be stationary, then be in a totally different area in the sky within seconds.  Unfortunately I never saw it actually move, I just happen to look away each time it relocated.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

After saying hello to everyone I sat down on the couch and looked out the window.  It was an overcast sky so the object I saw was definitely not a plane because it would have been too low.  The object looked like a teardrop shape, almost a spade shape, made up completely of red lights (Probably a good 10-15 red lights around the edge and in the center, symmetrical though.)  It seemed rather large.  It was below the clouds but above the tree line and houses.  The lights did not blink or flash or move formation.  The object hovered there for a second then slowly began descending.  As I was about to get everyone&#39;s attention to look outside because I thought I was losing my mind, the craft slowly disappeared behind the tree line and houses.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

11/26/09 18:30|Normantown|WV|Unknown|3-4 minutes|Stationary, star-like white lights suddenly approached and passed directly overhead|8/30/13|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/101/S101469.html|35|ndxe200911| Stationary, star-like white lights suddenly approached and passed directly overhead<n> <n><n> <n><n> After finishing Thanksgiving dinner, I stepped out on my parents&#39; front porch to smoke. It was dark, chilly, calm, and the sky was partially clear. I am an avid stargazer and am very familiar with the night sky in all seasons, and particularly with the night sky in this little valley.  We do have very dark skies here. So I was just surveying the sky, running through the visible constellations, when I noticed two pure white &#34;stars&#34; relatively low in the northwest, apparent magnitude of 2 or 3--about equivalent in brightness to the stars in the Big Dipper--and separated by less than 1/2 degree (less than the width of the full moon. At that point they looked completely star-like.  The puzzling aspect was that they should not have been there, as I knew from long experience that there were no bright stars in that region of the sky at that time of year.  A kind of inner &#34;alarm&#34; went off in me telling me to pay attention.<n> <n><n> <n><n> No sooner had I thought that than the white lights began to move toward the house at a fairly rapid clip. It took me a few seconds to believe my eyes and be convinced that these &#34;stars&#34; were actually moving. I quickly went back in the house and called my family out to see this. My mother and father, my adult daughter, and three of my teenage children came outside and we went into the front yard.  The lights were bigger, brighter, moving in tandem, and coming very close but no longer moving at high speed. I should note here that in late November in West Virginia, the nights are very quiet out here in the country. There are no insects, frogs or birds calling, and no man-made noise. The lights passed directly overhead and appeared to be fairly low, but the curious thing to me was that I could not discern the shape, or even if it was one craft or two.  All I could see were these two pure white lights.  When they were passing overhead they were separated by about 6-8 full moon widths (3-4 degrees).  I have to emphasize that on this perfectly quiet country night, there was absolutely no sound as these lights passed low and directly overhead.  They continued on in a straight line until they passed over the hill to the northeast and disappeared from view.  From the time the family got to the yard to the time whatever it was disappeared was probably about a minute.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At this point, everyone had a sort of bemused expression and there was surprisingly little talking.  I remarked that whatever that was, it was perfectly silent, and everyone agreed. We all went back in the house, and resumed our holiday as though it had never happened, which in itself is rather remarkable.  A few months later my father and I were talking about something that reminded me of this UFO sighting and I mentioned it to him.  He did not remember it. As he was 80 years old, I put that down to an effect of age, but later I mentioned it to my 26 year old daughter who was also a witness to it, and her memory of it was also very vague. I seem to be the only one of us who has a clear memory of this sighting. That seems to me to be one of two significant aspects of this, the other being the fact that these lights were far off and utterly stationary until the precise moment I realized there was something unusual about them.<n>

Neither were they airplanes...no colored or blinking/flshing lights whatsoever.  Looked like two bright bright stars, otherwise.  They were moving from north to south, not in a hurry.<n>

As I started to return to the house I looked up for stars and saw two directly overhead.  As I watched them it became obvious they were moving in unison in a straight line from N.W. to the S.E.  I called to my wife, she came out and witnessed them also.  The lead light was much brighter than the one trailing.  It was hard to judge the altitude and the distance between the two objects, and too dark to see if anything was connecting them.  The sighting lasted about two minutes.  I took a video of them but after reviewing it decided the quality was too poor to upload to any web pages. The lights never wavered from moving in a straight line.  They didn&#39;t make a sound either.<n>

I asked my son who was seventeen at the time to walk outside and check it out. Within seconds of him going outside onto the front porch, he screamed out for me to get out there fast. I jumped up and ran outside and he pointed towards the sky. I looked up and to the left of the house at the tree line, i saw two very bright lights hovering above the trees. They made no sound whatsoever and had no color to them at all. They were just very bright balls of light. They made no sound whatsoever. After a few minutes of watching them, one of the lights began moving toward the house at a slow pace and within a matter of seconds, the second light began to follow. At this point, i called my wife out to see what was going on. We all stood there on the front porch watching these lights pass directly over the house and slowly move towards th! e tree line on the opposite side of the property. As the lights came close to the tree line on the other side of the property, the just seemed to blink out. We never saw them again. My son had attempted to record the lights on his cell phone. During the recording, we could see the lights plain as day on the screen of his phone, but when we played the video once the lights had disappeared, there was absolutely nothing there in the recording.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It appeared to be two short, whitish blue blinking lights trailing behind a longer, turquoise blue light. The flight patterns were erratic and varying, not flying like any regular aircraft. The craft frequently dove and dipped in the sky, often seeming to flip over or rotate. The craft flew very quickly, faster than any regular aircraft. The craft often crossed the sky within eight seconds or less. When the craft appeared to be in the center of the sky, a slight whirring noise could be heard. About ten minutes into the encounter, the lights appeared to split and fly separately. The lights separated into smaller lights, a string of six to seven. After flying separately for at least thirty seconds, the lights recondensed back into one long light.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It seemed to be controlled by some form of intelligence, when it moved to disappear, it seemed to have moved in a downward parabolic motion as if to begin moving southbound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The light we saw was conceived over a near by cemetery, i just thought that that was kinda weird. I have no idea weather or not it has a practical explanation, but this was definitely something i haven&#39;t seen before and didn&#39;t appear to be of this world. I, and my two comrades saw this.<n>

It stopped momentarily, changed directions as if it was going to turn and make a circle, stopped again, and then move a little more west.  It did this two or three times then came to stop for approximately 5 minutes.  Then began to move west again very slowly and steadily towards the coast until it disappeared out of sight over the San Bruno Hills.  The distance of the object was unknown.  We were located on El Camino Real at the Tanforan shopping center it was a little before 2300 when we noticed it.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was an especially clear night, and I was staring up to the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> While she was putting her bag into the trash bin, I saw, near our visual horizon (the actual horizon was blocked by the garage and trees) what must have been a huge, chevron shaped craft.  Though i can&#39;t know for sure, it seemed like it would have been wider than a 747.  It was black, blacker than the night sky, almost felt like a shadow on the sky.  There were 6 lights, which looked exactly like stars of a medium intensity, one at the tip of the chevron/v shape, two others running along the sides and one at the inner apex of the V. It moved so quickly, and completely soundlessly that had I seen a video of it i would have laughed at how computer animated it looked. I gasped and said &#34;________ Oh my God, its a UFO&#34; by the time I turned her around to look at it, it was already almost over our visual horizon, and she didn&#39;t see it in time.  It was heading NNW towards Ojai.  In almost no time at all it was gone. In all, I couldn&#39;t have seen it for even 6 seconds, but it was very! very clear what I was seeing.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I was driving and noticed 2 white lights in a straight horizontal line off to the right and slightly ahead of me. Not knowing the area, I assumed they were lights marking the top of a tall building. The area is surrounded by trees so I lost sight of teh lights and really thought nothing of them at the time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Approximately 1 minute later I saw the same too lights appear from behind the tree line on the right side of the road and slowly cross, disappearing behind the trees on the left side. This was approximately 1/2 mile ahead of me. I again paid little attention to teh lights thinking they were just some aircraft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When we drove the the air craft crossed I then saw it again. The difference being now we were slightly under the craft and there were 3 white lights of equal distance apart. I could not see the shape of the craft, just the lights. I did see dim multi colored lights between two of the lights slightly forward of them leading me to believe that that section of the craft was slightly rounded there. I stopped my car and watched the craft for about 10-15 seconds. The whole time I was watching it did not move. I was just hovering about 75 yards of the ground and about 100 yards from me off to my back left side.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I turned away for a second and when I looked back the craft was begining to slowly move back across the road behind me. I lowered my window to watch it. I could not hear anything a very soft hum or whoosh sound. My radio was on but not turned up loud as I had an infant and toddler in the car. I watched it until it disappeared back behind the tree line on my right side. I waited for a momement to see if it would reappear and it did not.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My wife also witnessed all of the events. She is from a less educated country than the US and does not fully understand the normal flight of aircraft so the idea of a fairly quite hoovering craft was not concerning to her.<n>

I looked up in the sky as I was going to my car, and saw two lights going in the same direction, but they were connected. It looked kind of like two airplanes in formation at first.  There were other planes flying in the area (I live near an airport).  There were some stars showing and it was partly cloudy. The object floated about 10 – 20 mph if had to guess, and was maybe two football fields in length (no sound).(guessing)it floated into the clouds, and that was the last I saw of it.  If I were to guess, I would guess it was a blimp, but it  seemed to go into the clouds sideways.  Thanks for your time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date of sighting was flawed.

They continued to move in unison and get smaller and disappeared.  I googled the date and what happened, and it appears others have seen the same thing, even in other states as well.

They proceeded eastward, curving slightly toward the south.  The moon (half moon in waxing gibbous phase) was about 5 degrees from its zenith.  The curvature of the objects&#39; course brought them to appear to pass south of the moon.  As they neared the moon&#39;s position, first the lead light and then the following light turned red and faded quickly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was after I had first noticed that the objects were in motion and without blinking or nav/running lights that I sumoned my wife to see for herself.

I immediately had my parents and kids come join in the viewing of these two lights. Oddly enough they were silently cruising with the leading light ahead of the tailing light with a distance of 100-200ft in between both. Being of past military experience I noticed no FAA required strobes blinking, no sounds were emitted and it kept in perfect alignment throughout the duration. The lead light was 5 times brighter than the tail which suggested  one craft and not two crafts. As stated, no noise of engine propulsion was heard(propellers or jet rumble), no contrails were visible and no flashing light beacons on or near the lights. The estimation of its altitude would be about 2500 to 3000 ft. This viewing lasted about 7 minutes until it lingered out of sight. Keep in mind that the overall light radiance was ! as it appeared, whole orbs. They approached from the northwest direction and departed in a southeastern direction. Seeing how it was dark in the eastern skies, I couldn’t make a definite shape of this sighting but as I stress, the front and rear light alignment was perfectly straight.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I noticed 2 very bright stars. Brighter that most.  Then noticed they were moving slowly. I thought that they were satellites but satellites are not bright like the north star.  The speed increased and I noticed one was following the other clean across the sky toward the moon.  Then the trajectory changed to moving up toward the upper atmosphere and I could see them beginning to fade in brightness and size.  I could actually see the layers of atmosphere that the light was lighting up around them as they moved up out of the atmosphere until they vanished.  Was incredible. Shortly afterwards I may have heard large helicopter in the area. Not sure. Weird thing is I dreamed of this last week in a very vivid dream.<n>
11/25/09 17:33|Lake Forest|CA|Formation|10-15 minutes|Multiple luminating lights seen over horizon from Lake Forest, CA|12/12/09|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/073/S73494.html|58|ndxe200911| Multiple luminating lights seen over horizon from Lake Forest, CA<n> <n><n> <n><n> November 25, 2009 (originally written at 6:09 PM) Lake Forest, CA  At approximately 5:33 PM, I was sitting in the bedroom with my girlfriend ((name deleted)) while we were working on the computer when she saw a bright light in the sky and told me to check it out. This light was in approximation 33 degrees north and 117 degrees west from my location (used Google Earth to approximate degrees). The object did not move the first couple of minutes and I had the chance to get my binocular and look at it. The binocular is just a regular binocular; but looking at the light or &#34;object&#34;, it was a bright and luminating yellow light (which it looked as a single connecting object without the binoculars but with them it looked like four slightly separated lights in a shape of four equal sized small circles with the gaps pulsating with light). I was only able to take cell phone photo and images (did not have my digital camera with me) but the cell phone footage along with a drawing and other material is included. Upon looking at the first light for a couple of minutes, on the opposite side of the sky (east to the visible location of the 1st object) I saw another light that was pulsating yellow that seemed to be even closer (as it looked bigger) slightly moving before moving at fast speeds. While spending only a few seconds with the binocular on the 2nd object, it too seemed to be four small luminating circles which looked as one total piece when viewed by the naked eye. The first object seemed to be in Irvine as the Irvine Spectrum is completely visible by my location (and based by my perspective was hovering above Irvine Spectrum). The second object being to the other side of the sky was clearly in a different location and in a different city. After the second light was moving slowly, I saw the 1st light &#34;accelerate&#34; slowly and became barely visible (even with the binocular). The 2nd object while visible, seemed to be moving more rapidly back and forth (appearing huge, then smaller, then huge, then barely visible and faint)th! an the 1st one. Thinking the 1st object was gone, it came to v! iew agai n (about 70-75% of the size appearance) from the earlier appearance &amp; the 2nd object also came back to view. In observing the sky after my girlfriend pointed it out to me, the sky seemed very crowded and busy like never before. I am unsure what the objects were, but they certainly of no similarity to the other objects as the other objects were much smaller and of white colored light. If I had to guess, I would guess helicopters and possibly a jet for the faster moving object. There were other faint objects I could not identify clearly. After this and during the whole commotion, a 3rd light was clearly visible (to the west appearance of the 1st object for a brief time) but no more than two objects or lights were clearly seen and visible at any given time. As stated, the entire event was about 10-15 minutes but as quickly it all seemed to happen, the objects disappeared and did not come back (according to what we saw as we waited 10-15 minutes or so after) and the other lights! and possibly helicopters quickly after that (within 2-5 minutes after).<n> <n><n> <n><n> After the 1st light, I assumed it was some sort of projection light from the Irvine Spectrum; but after seeing the 2nd (and what seemed identical) light, I knew that was not possible. I don&#39;t know what the objects were that I saw, but they clearly were not an airplane, jet, or any other similar objects as the objects even stood to what it appeared completely still at times but also seemed to &#34;accelerate&#34; at extreme speeds but surely were the most unusual object(s) that I have seen my entire life. I have attached a drawing as well along with other footage so include it at your discretion. Thank you.<n>

Something caught my eye to the East.  I turned, and saw a Triangle-shaped object that had large dull white lights at all corners.  It was either in a right-hand bank turning North, or it was flying due West at a tilt because I could see the bottom of the object while it was apparently miles to the North of me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It traveled at approx. Mach 1-1.5.  It was completetly silent.  That impacted me quite a bit because being a glider pilot as well, I know that even a glider at higher speeds causes a lot of noise through aerodynamic means as air is &#34;split&#34; around the aircraft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object passed below a departing CRJ-200 from MEM.  I would love to know if anything was picked up on the aircraft&#39;s TCAS, or by MEM Center.   I have the urge to call them, but fear the backlash that may follow.  It was approximately 200 ft across to all corners.

The ovals moved toward the south and then appeared to vanish.  A single oval then moved quickly across the sky; it appeared to move more quickly than the preceding ovals; it moved the distance of my view (about 30 to 45 degrees) in about 10 seconds then disappeared; after this oval disappeared, an additional oval came across the sky not as fast as the previous one;   the sky remained clear for about 5 minutes then I note! d 2 orange ovals moving from north to south; the lead oval appeared to slow down and the following oval almost seemed to merge with it but did not; then the lead oval turned easterly and disappeared; the last oval also changed direction to the east and eventually vanished from sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have witnessed northern lights displays; these were not northern lights.  They appeared too high in elevation and moved in such ways that they could not be aircraft on night maneuvers even though there is an air force base 50 miles north.  I had lived in close proximity to the base and know what the aircraft look like in the dark.  I at first thought it was space debris burning in the earth’s atmosphere but no space debris nor meteors could change directions as I witnessed.  Space debris and meteors hit the earth; they don’t change direction and disappear.  I also thought it was something to do with the Space Shuttle Atlantis that had launched the week before but logically it was too far north.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It has never been my intent to seek out UFOs.  I enjoy star gazing but am only able to do so on rare occasions.  This whole thing occurred while I had my dog out for her nightly rituals.<n>

The sky was dark and clear with stars and a nearly full moon brightly shining in the high eastern sky.  I have a deck that faces SW and I have a nice piece of sky to view down to approx 20 degrees off the horizon to that direction.  I was watching some high commercial aircraft traffic on the Victor Airway above my house flying as usual from SW to NE, when I noticed directly above my deck a much brighter than usual star-like object moving slowly to the SW and then I noticed it had no strobes or navigation lights.  So I discerned this was a satellite and watched it for approx 10 seconds until it stopped for approx 3 seconds with no change in luminescence,  then quickly it did a 90 degree turn to the left or easterly from its original course lasting approx 2 seconds. It then turn 90 degrees again to the right and proceeded on a SW direction, then it seemed to speed up and disappea! red as to gain altitude and I lost visual reference.  So as a private pilot for over thirty years I can tell you that judging altitudes at night is nearly impossible but had to be somewhere above 40,000 ft.  No particular shape, sounds or other distinctions were observed because of the altitude.  The one distinction that I can make is this was no known aircraft in my inventory of my knowledge that can maneuver as this did.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Campbell, a bright yellow light streaked overhead, disappearing to the south.  A light rain was falling and, assuming it was near the base of these low clouds, it would have been going several thousand miles an hour.  About 10 seconds later, two red lights, coupled side by side, followed the same path, but were going at about half the speed.  These lights, which also disappeared to the south, were much larger than the yellow light but were not as bright.  I was wearing ear protectors because of the deafening gun noise, so I was unable to detect any sounds these lights may have made.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

At first I thought it was just an airplane, but upon closer inspection the object appeared to be stationary. So I stopped my car and stared at it for about 2 minutes. It wasn’t moving. There were 3 spherical bright white lights, with the middle light appearing slightly larger then the 2 outer lights. The lights were located about midway above the horizon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then the lights disappeared and turned into one dim bluish light resembling a star, but a bit larger, that was moving upwards at a very high speed. Then it disappeared and scanning I saw the light again on my right all the way on the other side of the sky. It was moving very fast horizontally as a dim blue light, not blinking like an airplane would be. Then it disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides little contact information.  PD))<n>

I looked up and began telling him that it was for them to see in the dark and noticed a bright l.e.d like red and blue constant light emitting from a &#34;V&#34; shaped object. I watched it for about three minutes and then received a call from my mother, who is a paramedic, and she told me that her crew was witnessing the same thing. I told her I was watching it too then proceeded to call the Police to witness it. I kept watching it until it started to travel towards Livermore, Ca then turned around and came back towards where I was. I watched it make a 180 degree turn without even slowing down then do the same thing again and head back to Livermore where I lost the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

There are three total witnesses.  The events I will cover happened in the same exact location on Chippewa County public land over Firth Lake Latitude: 45.2024648 Longitude: -91.2134803.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The first craft was observed as Witness A was peering out of the camper window because they noticed lights outside.  Witness A and Witness B went outside to check it out and Witness C stayed in the camper and pulled the blankets over their head.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object looked like about 20 lanterns hovering directly over Firth Lake approximately 15-20 feet above the lake.  Witness B picked up a flash light and was going to shine it at the craft, Witness A yelled at Witness B not to do that.  There were many bright white lights, however, you could tell it was only 1 craft and it was circular in shape and huge.  The craft just sat there for about 5 minutes and then in an instant shot directly up into the sky and was out of sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The second sighting was during bow hunting season approximately a year later.  Approximately 3pm witness D was in a tree stand and could see Firth Lake.  Out of no where comes 1 very bright white orb.  It was observed going around Firth Lake in a circular motion at a fast speed as well as moving up and down over the lake and then vanished into the woods.  Witness D was at first was amazed and then suddenly overcome with fear.  Witness D hasn&#39;t been back since  Background Witness A - Army/Airforce/Truck Driver 74 years old Witness B - Army/Plant Manager 45 years old Witness C - Nursing Home Activity Director 72 years old Witness D - Metal Injection Molding Operations 25 years old  I am not sure if this is a government agency I am reporting to or just some MUFON type of business.  I would really like to know what in the hell is going on there, I have heard there have been other sightings.  I haven&#39;t been back there to deer hunt since because I am just creeped the hell out by it.  People say it&#39;s just the Military, but why would they fly over Firth Lake?  There is nothing there for the Military...it&#39;s county hunting land.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I think some tests need to be done in that water there is something about that tiny lake that is attracting these things.  I would be willing to point anyone to the exact location where the crafts come to.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I used to enjoy hunting there with my family.  Ever since this I have not been back, I tried, but I get this erie feeling that someone or something is watching me and I always have to watch my back there.  I know it can&#39;t be military, why would they fly in like that in some wierd craft during hunting season?  What kind of Military personnel would fly around in a white orb doing circles around some random tiny lake?  I could see MAYBE flying in that large circle craft, however, that thing literally shot up into space so fast there is no way a human would survive....at least to my knowledge of G&#39;s.  What would happen if someone shot at one of these with a high caliber deer rifle?<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))<n>

Me and my brother have both recently moved to Bainbridge Island, WA , are students, and as far as I am aware he has never encountered a UFO. I only have the prior encounter I will enter after this one which may not even classify as a UFO. My recent experiences and curiosity sparked my interest into learning of reports in my area of the same object. My memory is not the greatest, and in my report I have included only details I clearly remember. Anything else has been left out and I would not want to add on information that is false, even if by mistake.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The incidence occurred at approximately 10:20 PM as I was watching television with my brother. At this time I noticed a low volume sound coming from outside. Curious as to what the noise was I stopped what I was doing, and changed my position. The room we were both in contains large glass windows that cover almost the entirety of the wall. As I changed positions I could see clearly an object that appeared very close to the ground for a plane, yet was not loud enough to be a helicopter. It was of saucer shape and had oval shaped lights which appeared to be of different colors. They seemed to create a haze for the object that was a grey/metallic color. The object swooped into my view for a moment, and then proceeded to shift up and to the side out of my view. The movements were very fluid as if the object was hovering.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In a curious yet alarmed state I dashed to the window to see if I could catch another view, this time urging my brother who was before preoccupied, to look with me. The saucer made a swoop back into our direction and view, allowing him to confirm to me that he saw what was making the noise as well. As the object was in my line of sight again it had appeared to have changed shape slightly, becoming more of an oval, until it passed overhead and out of sight. Approximately five minutes later an unmarked black helicopter flew overhead with lights on. I believe my location plays a large role in what we witnessed due to certain companies located around here, and multiple naval bases.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date is approximate.

11/23/09 17:40|O'Fallon|MO|Light|approximately 7 minutes|Bright red noiseless light traveled south to north at an altitude of 7,000 -10,000 ft for 7 minutes before blinking then disappearing.|12/12/09|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/073/S73441.html|74|ndxe200911| Bright red noiseless light traveled south to north at an altitude of 7,000 -10,000 ft for 7 minutes before blinking then disappearing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was a clear night and I was outside putting up Christmas lights.  I stepped back from the house and looked up to check the lights when I noticed a bright red light in the southern sky.  It was a little lower and to the left of the moon, about 45 degrees above the horizon.  It was about 3 times as large as Jupiter and about 3 times as bright.  I watched it for a while expecting to see some navigation lights appear as it approached me.  As it got closer I saw no additional lights and noticed it made no noise.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I ran inside to get the binoculars so I could get a closer look, as it was flying almost directly overhead.  Through the binoculars I saw no discernible shape to the object, just a bright red light quietly going across the sky.  It maintained the same altitude and did not flicker or change direction.  I decided to run inside to get my camera to take some pictures.  I managed to get a few shots, however as I am not that skilled with my camera while taking night shots, I had some trouble getting the auto focus to act right.  The pictures show a red (out of focus) spherical light.  As I watched it travel north off into the distance it then started to blink and went out as if someone had turned off a switch.  I believe it blinked about 5 times prior to it disappearing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Besides the moon, this was the brightest object in the sky.  I would say the entire event took about seven minutes and when I went inside to write down the specifics I noted the time was 5:47 P. M. central time.  I live about 30 minutes west of St. Louis Lambert airport so I see airplane traffic all the time, most of which travels west-east.  I hardly ever see any traffic flying south-north (especially this low).<n> <n><n> <n><n> About 10 minutes after the event I saw a plane coming in for a landing at Lambert airport, this object was roughly at the same altitude.  I am not that good at guessing altitudes so I was using this as my guide for an estimate.  My spouse said that my “incoming plane analogy” would indicate an altitude for the object of about 7,000 - 10,000 ft.  Please note it was not a plane or helicopter.  The body of a commercial plane at that height and directly above can clearly be seen on a cloudless night.  Additionally, engine noise and navigation lights for a plane should be easily discernable, none of which were observed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Again, the red light maintained the same altitude, did not flicker, made no noise and maintained a roughly south to north path.  I have never observed anything remotely like this before.<n>
11/23/09 01:50|Kissimmee|FL|Light|15 seconds|Unidentified orange ball of light observed ascending from ground into sky, lost sight of object in clouds.|12/12/09|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/073/S73439.html|75|ndxe200911| Unidentified orange ball of light observed ascending from ground into sky, lost sight of object in clouds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had just gotten off of work and was driving home when I observed a bright orange ball go from ground level and into the clouds.  The object was bright enough to light up the clouds around it, and at first glance I thought it was the moon.  The object did not appear to have a shape that I could see but the light was bright enough to have a kind of flare effect.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I watched the ball of light ascend into the clouds I lost track of it.  There weren&#39;t many clouds in the sky that morning I could see stars clearly.  The object did not appear to alter its course in any way and I assumed it was a rocket launch from the nearby Kennedy Space Center.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I arrived home I could find no reference of any launches and when I turned on the NASA channel they were not covering any launches.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was facing east on Osceola Parkway and the object appeared east-north-east of my position.  I think it has to be a rocket launch of some sort from KSC, but cannot find any informat! ion regarding this.  Further, I have witnessed two launches from the NASA causeway and viewed several launches from the Orlando area.  All previous launches left vapor trails, this did not.<n>

I didn&#39;t tell anyone at school about this because... why would I risk the humiliation. I really hope someone can get back to me about this. I would just really like to know if anyone else has experienced anything like this. Something tells me it is a genetic disorder, because my father and his father have both been plagued by similar experiences; only mine have seen such physical objects. I&#39;m not crazy and I know I&#39;m not. I graduated with a 3.27 with a double major in finance and accounting. I possess a analytical mind and consider my logic to surpass most. I hope you read this in its entirety, because I promise it goes beyond my dreams.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Since 15 years of age I started experiencing sleep paralysis. Most of the time it was nothing more than having a false sense of the waking world and an immediate threat of being immobilized. For a while I didn&#39;t know if it was just a part of my dreams. This continued for 7 years or so. It happened on and off. I never tried finding a reason for it as my dad said it had been a family issue passed down amongst the men. I had asked him what his dreams were like in leading to paralysis. He, like myself, had never had one particular dream that led to paralysis, but rather a multitude of situations.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My first clear dream that led to paralysis was of quite setting in my old neighborhood that I had recently moved out of. I was wrestling with my friends, the WWF way (fake wrestling), and we had just started a royal rumble. My close friends had immediately turned to adults with the same aging personalities. I didn&#39;t think twice about this in my dream. The match went underway and we all began to fight. I began to notice my opponents viciousness. They were all fighting with the vigor of lions and I was stuck throwing slow punches. Then somehow, I have no idea how, I realized I was dreaming. I immediately woke up and was immediately bound by my own body. It scared the shit out of me. Some time passed and I regained movement as well as a clear mind. See, during this whole moment of paralysis I was half awake... I was stuck in a constant stage of limbo (best way I can describe it). After I had awaken I walked around. I check my limbs and tightened them as hard as I could; I just ! wanted to recognize my strength. I then walked to the window and not even in the skyline I saw one &#34;silverish&#34;  oval, maybe 5 inches wide as tall in the horizon. It moved slowly and then got bigger and then slowly faded away. This was my first clear memory of the night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Fast forward 7 years.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have had many odd dreams, much like this. All a different situation and different outcome. I don&#39;t always see the silver oval, but it still remains the only clear object in such situations.  I have asked my father about this and he tells me that he had not experienced any silver oval, but his father had experienced UFO sightings... thought not directly tied to his paralysis.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My most recent and horrifying dream came to me about 8 months ago. It was the most frightening dream I have ever had. I was frantically searching through a medicine cabinet, looking for something. I was panicked and completely lost and then suddenly, like any other dream realization, I noticed something wrong, in the writing of the scripts. I immediately knew I was dreaming and at that moment everything went white. I thought I had finally begun to lucid dream, something I had wished for ever since I started sleep paralysis. Then I heard a voice. A voice that no sound on earth could possibly imitate, this was no Britney spears shit, this was something omnipotent. Something that transcended the mind and lingered throughout consciousness. It spoke no definable words, but I knew what it said, &#34;what are you doing alex?&#34; It said this with such care and malaise that I instantly felt paralyzed and soon enough, woke up to my most vivid sleep paralysis yet.<n> <n><n> <n><n> While lying there, in my immobile state on my bed, I saw it a arms length away. The silver oval came up to me, it was as tiny as I first saw it a thousand miles away. I was breathing frantically and it did not waiver. It just rested right in front of me as if newtons third law was a farce. As with all of my other experiences, it faded as did my paralysis.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I could be crazy, but I don&#39;t know. I haven&#39;t had sleep paralysis in some time now... I&#39;m not looking to be contacted for questioning... I only want to know if there has been anyone else that has experienced what I have.<n>
11/22/09 23:00|Homestead and Miami (between)|FL|Flash|about 5 seconds|Three rainbow colored prisms in  teardrop shapes came out of no where and vanished over a bay between Homestead and Miami.|12/12/09|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/073/S73500.html|77|ndxe200911| Three rainbow colored prisms in  teardrop shapes came out of no where and vanished over a bay between Homestead and Miami.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It happened returning by car from the Homestead NASCAR championship race late last Sunday night. First my companion and I had stopped in Homestead for dinner in a local Mexican restaurant, which I remember closed at 10 or 10:30, and we left shortly after that to return to Miami. It was late and dark over the ocean as the car went over one of several bridges between Homestead and the islands east of Miami, where we were headed. Freeway bridges. I remember we were still well south of Miami when it happened.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was in the passenger seat with the passenger window open wide, looking directly out to the black ocean beyond the bridge. Roughly, to the east. There were lights along the walls of the bridge, but not too bright, because the darkness beyond was visible. It was very still and not many cars. No sign of anyone in particular below, or any boats there. Nothing stirring around the sky, the water, or on the sidelines of the bridge, where there were buildings or concrete, where some sort of aspects of the ongoing urban zone had vaguelly registered on my mind. It was not a swampy area or rural zone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It had been raining, and was still a little bit, so the humidity was feeling pretty high, and there was the apparency of some degree of condensation. Before my eyes my brain registered a sort of swooping thing, what I don&#39;t know. It was only visible there about a second, maybe less. The shock of it was less strong than my mind&#39;s effort to try to place what it was, but it couldn&#39;t. It still can&#39;t.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was possibly a foot across and a foot and a half long. But it was shaped something like a teardrop or a puff of smoke with a wider head and a long, thin sort of tail or an impression of a projection - sort of shaped like Casper the  Friendly Ghost in the cartoon, when Casper was about to swoop away, his &#34;tail&#34; down to a small squiggle. Hard to describe. But I had the sense, at the time, that the tail-thing was moving a bit. Propelling it? I couldn&#39;t say. But that it had some sort of motion to it stays in my impression of it. Not a terribly pronounded thing, maybe, but there was that aspect to my initial impression.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The thing started out like it could have been a flare up of some kind, like when a fire or a spark might pass over a small concentration of gas lingering somewhere in the air and cause it to flare up for a second . That was exactly what it seemed like at the time. Except for things that bothered me about it, even as it happened. It was a rainbow of light flaring up toward me. I remember I started to automatically jerk back, but realized it wasn&#39;t coming any further.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Throughout its entire form,it looked like a rainbow, almost exactly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Only not quite. Some of the colors were missing, mostly the subtle blurred shadings between colors, were sort of missing. And there was too much white, or yellow-white, in it, which increased with each successive flare, of which there were two more.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The first one had a lot of green and blue and red, pretty much like a rainbow. Only the colors were too something - too milky, maybe - to be from light refraction such as I have ever seen it before. Too solid. And shaped like the blob I described.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It came literally out of no where. I was staring out into the night to the right of the car, and it flared up out of nothing. One instant it wasn&#39;t there and the next it was. And to me the oddest thing was, even though  the colors were there so bright against dark night sky, there a blackness surrounding and encasing the spectrum which I saw was not quite the blackness of the sky behind it. It was black like the sky, but somehow it didn&#39;t quite match the sky. And odd as it seems now to have noticed this, the edges, where the black of the sky met the black of the shape, the edges between the two seemed to blur, where the object&#39;s edges sort of &#34;ran&#34; like a watercolor, over the top of the sky. It had something about it that reminded me of the quality and order of blackness of the old telephones in the 1950s. It had a different aspect of solidity than the blackness of the sky behind it, too, though in a way it seemed to match the color of the sky. And the shape of the spectrum inside of the black surrounding it was a bit off from the type of shape than I have associated with any random spectrum I have ever seen. And the colors were very solid and bright.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Not neon bright. But, at the least, outstanding.<n> <n><n> <n><n> And when it appeared, it loomed. It came out of nothing, surged a bit toward me, forward and nose slightly turning down toward me, and then stayed suspended there, and then just vanished. It didn&#39;t fade away. It&#39;s spectrum was not moving, but was not rigid, either, in the glow or strength of the colors it had.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Oddly,the car was going pretty fast, faster than the speed limit, possibly as much as 80 mph, based how how fast my driver is inclined to drive in such road conditions. Yet I am aware for an entire half to whole second, I could observe it right there where I was looking. That seems odd, too. And it is also possible the bridge had columns or slates at regular intervals, because my impression seems to incorporate them into the event.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The second incident was beyond another of these break points in the side of the bridge. The first one seems to have occured within a different break point than the second.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The first one never came beyond the edge of the side of the bridge.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I don&#39;t think it ever was extremely near to the bridge itself, though my impression was it was not very far beyond it. Maybe a few feet. The others were about the same distance.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A couple of seconds later, when I was only a little beyond the first sighting, another, smaller sighting appeared. The same way.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Maybe half as large. The second one didn&#39;t surprise me as much, it only seemed interesting. And it disappeared maybe a little faster.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It had had more white/yellow to it, but was otherwise similar enough to be considered the same phenonena. The third one, basically the same, though far smaller and not so much color, came and went the same way, though it appeared before, or maybe as the second one was vanishing. I&#39;m not sure I saw the third one vanish before we had moved beyond it. Neither of these were appearing to zoom toward me as the first one did.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When they were gone, I watched a little bit for others, still sort of assuming they had been something typical for whatever atmospheric conditions there were off the side of the bridge. Once we were off the bridge I asked my friend what they were, and described them to him. He is a Miami native and has driven north over that bridge many times at night from work he was doing in Homestead. He had no idea what I was talking about and said it sounded like I had been drinking, which I had not. I asked him what was along the seawall along that stretch. He said he thought it might be something industrial, but he wasn&#39;t sure. He was vague on where that spot even was, only having ever passed over it on his way to somewhere else, and there are a lot of bridges along the route.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My window was fully open  and I was looking directly out of it. I never smelled anything unusual. No car exhausts. No unusual smells at all. It was all fresh and clean out there, after a recent short bout of rain. There was no sound to what I saw. It all came and went so fast, no fanfare, no aftermath. In a way it seemed perfectly normal and natural. But it wasn&#39;t. I don&#39;t know what it was.<n> <n><n> <n><n> .<n>

The light was flat and thin and I reacted it was lightening, the next moment night became day it was so bright and stayed like that so i said that&#39;s not lightening and looked out of the car window to the east<n> <n><n> <n><n> Across the sky from North to south arching across the sky was a massive fireball.  It started from below the cloud line and proceeded up across the arc as I watched and then the whole thing just disappeared  it was really big and traveling fast, the whole thing was red with black cast pieces as if it had come stright out of a movie It was really big and the plume was the same distance as the head and then trailed to nothing.  The head was like boiling gas pumping into the sky and then gone, no vapor trail nothing.  Other people reported seeing coloured lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It is truly the most bizarre thing I have seen, they say it was a meteor, but there is 4 things wrong 1.  It was going up not down, 2 how many meteors make night into day, 3 it vanished and if that had hit the ground their would have been a bang of note and  crater somewhere as it was big  official version is it exploded and they are looking for bits of it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I did not see any debris and for 10.55 at night the sky was blue it was so clear.  It was seen 600km<n>

I was headed East on Decoto Road at around 6:45pm when I noticed a flying aircraft of some sort traveling South; parallel to Mission Blvd, right above the hills.  I noticed one red light, one teal looking light and one white light.  Naturally I thought it was a commercial airline until it made a very quick right turn going west.  That is what caught my attention right away.  I came to a red traffic light and continued to watch the aircraft fly west to the right of me.   As it got closer I noticed it switched angles and I could now see only three vertical, round red lights blinking in a sequence.  Then not a moment later the aircraft came to a complete stop in mid air and hovered in the same spot.  I honked my horn to get the driver next to me to look up and see what I was seeing, but they just drove off.  The traffic light had now turned green, so I pulled my car over to the side of the road and got! out.  I stood and watched this aircraft hover for about a minute or two. I noticed that I could not hear any sort of noise coming from this aircraft either.  I think it might have been about 2 or 3 football fields in the air.  It defiantly seemed noticeably close.  The aircraft then started to move again and it continued west until I could not see it anymore.<n>

I could make out the tree line in the night sky, and somewhat above the tree line I picked up a glowing object.  It was much larger than a star or even planet in the sky, about the size of my thumb nail at arms distance, maybe slightly larger than that.  It was a bright and contained light, not diffuse, and was traveling at a fairly slow speed at about a 20 degree downward angle towards the west (moving from my left to my right). At first I thought it was a plane, or other known craft, but something about it was not quite right. It was descending towards an area where there was certainly no place to land, and it was too low.  I watched it for about 10 seconds or less, and then it simply vanished. Its vanishing point was above the tree line.  That is when I thought it was almost certainly something odd.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I drove about 500 more yards forward, and parked in the parking lot of the Stinson Mt. Grill, and scanned the skies. I saw nothing else. Other cars passing by at that point didn&#39;t seem to be alert or disturbed by anything. I asked a few folks in the Restaurant if they had seen anything, but none had.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I really don&#39;t know if it had a rational, mundane explanation.  At that point I simply could not classify my experience.<n>

I was facing the wall and he was looking out the window.  He was observing some type of white light in the sky moving upwards diagonally at a very rapid speed for about 5 seconds when he informed me to turn around.  When I looked out the window, I too saw a very bright light moving across the sky quite rapidly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After I looked for about 3 seconds the light just disappeared out of the sky.  It was too small, moving extremely faster, and not the right shape to be an airplane. It was also too big/bright of a light to be anything shot up into the sky.  Nor was it a comet or shooting star due to the size being too large, the light being too bright, and there was also no tail at all.  It was semi-hazy and the sun had just went down not that much prior to the sighting, and nothing outside of our atmosphere could be seen at the time so it was definitely something leaving the planet.  It was a very nerve rattling event, since neither of us had ever seen anything like that before, and it was completely unexplainable.<n>

11/20/09 23:30|Nashville|TN|Unknown|3-5 seconds|Blurry blob of light streaking through sky above a cloud|12/12/09|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/073/S73415.html|95|ndxe200911| Blurry blob of light streaking through sky above a cloud<n> <n><n> <n><n> Last night I was outside at approximately 23:30.  I was on the west side of my house between my house and my neighbor’s house.  I was walking northward towards my back yard.  There were a few low clouds that were mostly transparent.  I saw a streak of light traveling from east to west above one of the clouds.  Because I saw it through the cloud, it was kind of blurry.  It was traveling very fast, and it only lasted a few seconds before it flew out of site behind my neighbor’s house.  My first thought is that it was a meteor.  However, I watched a meteor shower several weeks ago, and this “streak” traveled a longer distance than the meteors I’ve seen.  It was also traveling the opposite direction of the meteors I saw a few weeks ago.  (I admit that I don’t know much about meteors, and I assume they can travel in any direction.)  However, this streak didn’t look as long as the meteors I saw and it lasted longer.  My next thought is that it was a spotlight, but! I searched the horizons, and I didn’t see any spotlights shining up and moving around.  My last explanation was that it could have been some light refracting through the corner of my glasses lenses, and it created some sort of optical illusion.  However, there were no cars driving by or any other moving source of light that could have caused that.  Also, since I’ve worn glasses for years, I can say that I have never experienced an optical illusion of a light in a cloud due to refracted light though my glasses.  It was too fast to be a plane, plus there was no noise.  It was most likely a meteor, but it didn’t look or behave like the meteors I’ve seen.  But I admit that may be because my sight of it was distorted though the low thin cloud.  I would say that the chances of this being some sort of ET craft is very low, but since I couldn’t positively identify it, it was a mystery to me, and therefore, a UFO.  I just wanted to report it so that there would be record of it in c! ase someone else saw something, too.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I continued driving and then I looked back and saw another light. I thought it rather odd that these two planes were so close together, but then as if out of no where I saw a 3rd light appear. The lights were almost in the form of part of a octagon. Then one of the lights when out and a second light when out. Next time I looked I saw a light reappear and finally the third light reappear. This time they were almost in a perfect triangle formation. There was still some light out at the time, even though the sun had set, so I could tell that they weren&#39;t all a part of the same vessel. Also, there were no flashes lights coming from the orbs that would have lead me to recognize that they were planes. After that, I then lost track of the lights as the trees along the highway we! re blocking my line of light, but about 20 to 30 minutes later I looked in my rear view mirror and still saw those lights in the sky.

My daughter is 7 years old and was playing in the back yard.  I had just plugged in the deep fryer and had my back to her when she called to me to look.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I turned around and saw it immediately.  You couldn’t miss it.  The sun was setting behind the mountains between my house and the Reagan Presidential Library and the sky around the mountaintops was a beautiful orange glow.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The craft was a bright glowing beautiful light blue exactly the color of the inside of a flame from a lighter.  Not the red part of the flame, but the inner blue part of a lighter flame.  It was shaped like a hockey puck.  It was flying less than 100 feet above the ground and was going around in circles over the mountain slopes.  I saw it from the side from my backyard about 6000 feet or1 mile away, so from that perspective, it looked flat just like a hockey puck.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I gauged the size of the craft, from 50-75 ft. in diameter, based on a large white water storage tank that sits on one of the hills it was flying over.  It flew silently in circles over these hills and since I saw it from the side, it was banking from side to side as it reached the outer extent of its circular flight, like a skateboarder in a pool.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My first thought was how beautiful it was and how gracefully it traversed the sky.  Then it appeared to come closer to me and I got a little nervous.  Next it went back to the mountain and ducked out of sight.

I happened to be looking up at a tree next to my home and then noticed, in the far distance and at a great height, what looked like stars.  Though this seemed rather odd for the time of day, I glanced elsewhere in the sky to see if I could see other stars.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Naturally I couldn’t. But when I glanced back at the formation, I noticed that the formation, which consisted of approximately thirty shining, sparkling star-like objects, was steadily moving horizontally to the right. The objects maintained their respective positions as the whole formation moved.  The formation looked something like this:<n> <n><n> <n><n> ……… ………        ……… …..   …… ……………… ………….<n> <n><n> <n><n> After about four minutes, maybe less, I began to walk to my car as I had someplace to go.  I then decided to once again check for the formation in the sky before I left.  At this point I could not longer find  the formation.<n>

The ufo went from a white ish color to a red/orange color and became brighter then disappeared or folded as I call it. This happened all under a minute.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

11/19/09 19:40|Okeechobee|FL|Light|17 minutes|Many small lights and bright orange flashes.|12/12/09|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/073/S73391.html|109|ndxe200911| Many small lights and bright orange flashes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On November 19th 2009 at approx. 1940 (7:40 pm) my stepson called and he was telling me about some unexplained lights that he was observing southwest of his home. He lives 5 miles NW of Okeechobee, Fl.  I went outside of my home and began to look for the objects. I live 18 miles SE of Okeechobee, Fl, as we are rural there is a very low level of ambient light so I have an exceptional view of the night sky. Because I didn’t know the brightness of the objects that my stepson was observing, I turned off my backyard and garage light. My stepson and I were talking on our cell phones for several minutes while I attempted to locate the small-lighted objects that he has been observing for at least 10 minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At about 1950 (7:50 pm) I was looking west northwest over my neighbors’ home, and I observed several small lights moving in an area roughly 20 degrees wide and thirty to forty degrees high and approximately 25 degrees above the horizon. This corresponded to where my son-in-law was now looking. I was not able to determine the range or altitude of the small-lighted objects. These small-lighted objects were moving erratically and on several occasions when the lights came within close proximity to one another, I would see a very bright inverted tear shaped orange glow that would last for about 5 seconds. During the time I was watching the group of small-lighted objects were working slowly in a northerly direction. Sometime during all of this I asked my wife to come outside and see what I was looking at. My wife was able to see three of the small-lighted objects but none of the bright orange glows appeared. The activity that I observed continued for about 5-7 minutes then cease! d. All of the small lights disappeared and I never saw another of the bright orange glows.<n> <n><n> <n><n> During the time that I was observing all of this activity I was communicating by cell phone to my stepson and he was observing exactly the same activity that I was. I attempted to capture a few pictures on my cell phone camera but the movements were so erratic that I was unable to do so.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Some observations that I had were: Small-lighted objects were flashing points of white light, the movements of the these objects were very erratic and of a type not consistent with any aircraft that I have ever seen. The lights didn’t appear to be following one another they closed on each other from a heads on attitude. I didn’t see anything being emitted from these objects The bright orange glows were many times larger than the small-lighted objects and had no movement component to them. These glows all looked similar in shape and size; there were no trails from these glows in any direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I also was watching the air traffic in the area. I did not see any sudden course changes or any other abnormal flight patterns. Because we are in the center of Florida there is allot of air traffic transitioning the area at multiple altitudes and directions.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After this light show was over, my stepson and I were talking about what we had just seen and I asked him what he originally saw that caused him to call me. His statement is below: He had gone outside to sit with a couple of his friends. They were talking and he happened to look up.  He noticed a “V” shaped formation of small objects moving from the south. He continued to watch and then he saw another formation of the lights moving from the north. This second group of lights were scattered and not a discernable formation. The “V” shaped group moved past the scattered group and turned 180 degrees and that is when the orange glows began. At this point he gave me a call.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

After turning south onto 211th Ave, I saw a cluster of orange lights twinkling. I noticed that it didn&#39;t move. It stayed in the same spot while I drove down the road. It looked like it was hovering over the desert behind my house in Circle City, located between Surprise and Wickenburg. I pulled over to the side of the road and called my house. I told my boyfriend to go outside and look up. He and our five children saw it as well. He said it was extremely low, and hovering. I told him it looked like a triangle formation. He agreed. He noticed another cluster to the right (west) of this one. It was about 10 minutes from the time I saw it, and I drove into an area where I wasn&#39;t able to see it. After about three minutes where I was able to get to a point to see it again, it was gone. I asked my boyfriend what happened, and he said the lights just went out. We both have never seen anything like thi! s.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It didn&#39;t appear to be extremely large, and was clearly not very high above the trees (perhaps only 500 feet above the ground or less), so it caught my attention. It also wasn&#39;t moving quickly--- in fact, it wasn&#39;t moving at a steady rate of speed either. It was moving like a car might move when people are in a parking lot looking for a space to park, steadily moving but at different rates depending on the view. It was nearly perfectly triangular, at least as far as I could tell. The tips of the triangle&#39;s corners were edged in white constantly shining &#34;v&#34;-shaped lights, and at the exact center was a red, unblinking light. I thought at that speed it traveled that it must be a helicopter. I hit the brakes and would have stopped except for the traffic. Whatever it was, it slowly crossed over above the trees by th! e elementary school, where it appeared to hover briefly. I opened the window to try and hear the typical whoosh-thump of a helicopter, but instead heard only a whining hum similar to the sound of a slowing jet turbine or a large centrifuge. I looked forward for the split second to drive safely on the street, and the next moment I glanced back at it was gone, except for a brief wink of red light on the distant horizon. I had only seen it for perhaps a minute total of driving time.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Time was approximately 1900 hours, CDT, US.  There were one or two military jets doing passes prior to the sighting this time around.  The jets had left the area before the sighting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A large almost linear array of amber &amp; red lights blinked on for a few seconds, then blinked off, and blinked on again several seconds later for about the same elapsed time--the second time the craft was slightly to the left of the first time.  The craft was east-southeast at about 15 degrees above horizontal (visible about a fingernail&#39;s-width-at-arm&#39;s-length above the local treeline).<n> <n><n> <n><n> The pattern size was about a fingernail&#39;s-width-at-arm’s-length and horizontal in orientation.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The array was rock-solid, i.e. hovering motionless during illumination and displaying no change in relative position of the individual lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This could have been two separate craft, but there was no way to tell because the two illuminations did not overlap in time.<n>

I was driving on the A2 from Dover north towards Canterbury, it was about 3 miles from the Lydden turn off.  I saw what looked like a bright star at first, which was odd as it was still light with light cloud cover, it was bright, sun was just going down.  I saw this object which was stationary, as I got closer the shape changed, it appeared cigar shaped, but was segmented with what appeared to be windows.  It looked like a plane without wings, it did not move,  It was in view for about 5 mins, then it just disappeared as if switching a light off.  The road was quite busy at this time so it must have been seen by others.<n>

I thought it was one of those police helicopters. A little surprised and upset, I turned around, looked up and I saw this fireball, that seemed to me was not moving. This lasted for maybe ten seconds. And it dissapeared. To me it seemed the fireball was not far from the rooftop of the house across the street. I did not notice any form of a craft, but only the fireball because I was terrified. During the first day after it happened, I thought I might have seen a meteorite or astroid that exploded. But this one was not moving fast and it did not cause a trail.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

After the fourth illumination, I saw 4 tiny white dots moving very slowly across the sky and within a second or two all the lights disappeared.  They reappeared in almost the same area, in the same pattern and it happened again for a total of 3 cycles.  They were approximately 200ft AGL, 2 miles from our home.  The colors were a yellowish orange that seem to change colors and almost flicker.<n>

I am not sure if this was one craft or possibly 3 flying in formation. No other &#34;meteors&#34; were seen, although I try to catch every meteor shower.  I have seen my fair share of meteors and never have I seen anything like this.  I want to say that the three points were kind of reddish in color, they were not lit up like a light, but were still distinguishable in the night sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

I went out side to see a bright light above Little Cottonwood Canyon then 2 aircraft came over the range and seemed to be moving at a high rate of speed in a southwestern direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We continued to observe for a bit and then decided to go back in the house.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

I was driving from Lancaster to Ridgecrest and had just gotten off of Garlock road onto the 395.  The time was about 11:05 pm.  I saw a very bright ball trailing light, flying level for a few moments.  Then suddenly it looked as if it impacted the desert off in the distance towards Ridgecrest.  The impact looked like nothing I’ve ever seen before.  No sparks or secondary fire explosions.  It just lit up the entire sky in a Blue/White color. All I could say to myself was “what in the hell was that?” I sped up to try and get to Ridgecrest as soon as I could, I was concerned for my families safety. There’s a military base in the town and my imagination is running wild while I’m driving.  I thought maybe it could have been an aircraft crashing into the town..  When I reached Ridgecrest everything looked normal and no emergency equipment out driving around.  I am assuming what I may have seen was a meteor that! actually made contact with the ground.  It’s the only thing that would make sense to me.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was above the peaks of the Bridger Mountains but much closer to where I was, possibly over Belgrade.  It moved from NW to SE very quickly.  There was absolutely no sounds.  It&#39;s very quiet here; I can hear planes taking off from the airport sometimes and I&#39;m about 8 air miles from the runway.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was a cold night with scattered clouds to my west.  There were house lights in the area but it was very dark in the direction I saw this.  I think the moon was up, to my south, but I can&#39;t remember.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The approximate size was about 300 feet across, looking left to right.  Not sure of other dimensions.  It reminded me of the cigar shaped objects I&#39;ve seen in CG reports but thinner.  Since I only saw what looked like a reflection, I can&#39;t be certain of the shape.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I looked further right and the light or object seemed to stop.  It was almost hovering over Bozeman then disappeared after a very short time, possibly a minute.  Within 1 minute of it vanishing, a plane approached the area from the SE.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Upon further investigation I can&#39;t be certain of what I saw.  I do wear glasses and even though I tried to repeat my movements that I made immediately prior to seeing this I could not see the same or anything similar.<n>

It was above fistly stationary, positioned like a star.  I thought it was a star until it began to move.  It moved from a southerly to a north trajectory.  At first I thought it was a satelite, I always like to keep a look out for them, however, this object seemed too bright witha golden glow and travelled at a fast pace.  It was faster than a plane but not quite as fast as the satelites I have seen.  This object also went in a line.  It didnt travel in an axis like I see satellites do.  In the objects last moments from sight, it seemed to change transparant then briefly back to a bright glow then translucent then dissapeard.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

We got to his house, then immediately saw this bright orange glow in the sky as we stepped out.  This one passed over our heads.  My friend said it was high up and was fast, but I think it was lower and slow.  The aircraft, from a closer view, had two bright orange lights, one in front and one in the back, and white and blue flashings lights on either wing.  The shape of the craft was undetermined because it was really dark.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Another one of these lights passed over our heads, but still not close enough to get a great description.  Then a third came and we started feeling a little unsettled.  We looked away to get something for ten seconds and the third light disappeared into the night sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We went inside shortly, but about 15 to 20 minutes later, we went back outside and saw another light, this time coming from the opposite direction (as if it was a previous light returning).  Then, sitting around the table outside, we saw another light in the distance.  This one looked smaller, but its light would dim in and out, and twice the light disappeared altogether, once for ten minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were unsure what this is, but it’s definitely something I’ve never seen.  My friend tried to explain it by saying it was just a couple airplanes with brighter lights, but that doesn’t explain why the light would disappear altogether for ten minutes and reappear in the same place.  That was the truly weird part.<n>

The the original top bright orange light would become the bottom and it too would fade out and a new one would appear in line above the one light left.

11/17/09 18:15|Caledonia County|VT|Sphere|few minutes|2 golden yellow orbs in northeastern VT above road|12/12/09|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/073/S73373.html|138|ndxe200911| 2 golden yellow orbs in northeastern VT above road<n> <n><n> <n><n> Saw two UFOs last night at about 6:30 PM EST as I arrived home from work.  When I pulled around the corner by my house in the rural village where I live, I saw two large, bright golden orbs above the road just south of my house.  They were stationary, parallel to each other, and fairly close to each other at a height of, by my estimate, of about 150 or so feet above the road.  They were also moving in an erratic manner side-by-side to each other, sort of leapfrogging over one another.  One would quickly leapfrog over the other to a parallel position next to the one just jumped.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then the one just jumped would perform the same maneuver over the first one in the same direction.  This occurred maybe two to three times then they reversed the process in the opposite direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Once, the lights seemed to flick off to black but shortly came back on.  When the maneuvers seemed to have ended and they both went black, I parked my car and got out in the dark, but seeing nothing in the sky went into my house.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Within about twenty minutes of my sighting, I received a phone call from a friend in my town who lives about 2 miles from me saying that in the company of their son they had observed a similar display on their way home from a different direction to town.  They stopped, got out of their car, and went to a field above their home to further observe a similar performance to mine above their field.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The activity I saw occurred maybe two to three times in a matter of a few minutes from the time I stopped in the road to observe them.  I was stopped in the travel lane of the road while seeing this activity.  Three or four cars passed me in the road during this time.  Though no one else stopped, I can’t believe no one else saw this because of the size of the orbs, their proximity directly above the dark road, and their erratic behavior.  Very odd.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Apparently many UFO sightings were observed and reported locally at this time, but the media has attributed them to the Leonid Meteor showers that are occurring.  This is not what I observed.  I have watched the sky most of my life. I have seen the comets Hale-Bopp and Halley’s, meteors and their showers, and satellites.  These definitely are NOT what I saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have seen many anomalies in both the night and day skies here since the mid- to late-1990s.  I am a financial professional.<n>

Leaving work, walking across the parking lot, I looked up at the sky as usual.  I saw an amber colored, round light.  I heard no sound.  First I thought it was a far off plane coming in for a landing.         (Lebanon Airport is on a hill right behind my job site) then this light faded as another came on.  This was in a straight line, so I thought the plane was banking and I was seeing the other wing.  Then another light came on at the same rate as the second one faded, still in this straight line, at about a 35 degree angle to horizon from right to left.   still no sound.  I realized this was not a plane.  They were not flares being dropped.  Flares don&#39;t remain stationary.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Since it was dark, and the lights of the parking lot were on, I couldn&#39;t see a craft.   The lights repeated this pattern at least 6 times.  I am not sure how far away these lights were from my position, but they were low in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I stopped a coworker to show him just before the display ended.   He was as baffled as I was.  We could hear a plane take off from the airport.  It flew over us at this time.  There was still no sound coming from the direction of the lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I got into my car and drove out of the parking lot and onto the highway as fast as I legally could.  I wanted to get away from the parking lot lights.  Looking in the direction the lights were, I saw nothing unusual,  just stars, the sky was clear.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

My wife said what’s that pointing to the east at an large object stationary in the sky.  The object appeared to be oblong in shape and a bright rust-orange color. It looked like separate lights  (you could see dark between the lights making it look like segmented lighting) lined up in a row slightly curved to the east.  The object  brightened in intensity then faded quickly and was not visible (this sighting lasted 7-10 seconds).  We both watched the area and then the same type of object started to appear again approx. 6 miles south of where this last object had disappeared from. It was not as bright and faded quickly and was not visible (this second sighting lasted maybe 4-6 seconds).<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object was located over the Armargosa Mountain Range in Death Valley (the ridge line of the mountain was still quite visible).  I did a compass bearing after the sighting which was 29 degrees (declination set to 15 east) from Stovepipe Wells Village. The line of sight runs from Stovepipe to Corkscrew Peak to Armargosa Mountain Range to North of Beatty, Nv.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We watch the International Space Station and Space Shuttle quite often from here. Neither of these were visible tonight in the Death Valley area (11/17/2009) in checking the ISS Human Space Flight Site.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The size of the object is what amazed us!   The Space Station and Space Shuttle (even when docked together ) are just large moving (non-blinking) lights in the sky.  And regular aircraft in the area are just small to moderate blinking lights in the sky.  In comparison and distance from us, this object had to be at least a HALF MILE in length!<n>

I had swept the sky a couple of times in order to avoid missing any.  When I turned from the east and was facing almost due west, I looked straight up and something caught my eye. I saw one meteor and then something else.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I focused on it I saw a total of five dim dots, perhaps lights, arranged in a V, or chevron.  I could not tell their altitude so determining speed is nearly impossible.  They were moving from the north to the south in a very smooth and straight line.  I watched them/it for about five to ten seconds before the ambient light from the city made them/it disappear.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I heard nothing.

Multi-colored flashing lights, including orange, yellow, red, blue, and purple changed around perimeter causing what appeared to be a spinning effect.  It occasionally moved horizontally but primarily maintained a fixed position approximately 20 degrees above the horizon.  As the meteor shower dissipated, a civilian or military aircraft flew past the object which then slowly moved away at a steep angle allowing the disc shape to be seen more clearly.  It could be seen with the naked eye and, in more detail, through Tasco Offshore 21  7x50mm binoculars.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This was witnessed by a 50 year old professional person and spouse along with a high school sophmore and two college students.<n>

I could not decipher whether there were 5 individual crafts or one craft with 5 lights. The lights were not blinking.<n> <n><n> <n><n> From about 30 degrees up from the eastern sky, it took about 7 seconds from where I picked it up to where it disappeared on the western horizon.  The group of lights were about twice the size of the Little Dipper constellation.  What made the experience so erie, was that it was flying too fast to be flying high or flying too low to not emit any noise.  It was totally silent.  There were no other sounds in the neighborhood to distract from hearing any noises from above.<n>

We both heard what I can only descibe as a huge jet way too close to our house and only getting louder, then for about half a second, silence and then a huge boom that shook our entire house! We thought for sure there was just a massive plane crash very near our house and ran outside. It of course being Washington, it was raining and we couldnt see anything. Within minutes, we heard 3 seperate helicopters coming from different areas.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At that point, we were confident that we would definitly be hearing about this in the news the next morning. Morning came and there was nothing. I spent hours online searching for the smallest piece of report that we werent the only ones that heard and felt whatever this was. Nothing in the papers, online or of course on the news. Its as if it never happened.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I just want to make very clear, that whatever this was, when it &#34;crashed&#34; our house shook like it was an earthquake. We live in Mount Vernon, WA. My husband has seen some strange things in the sky here in the same area before and we saw strange lights a few years ago out towards Deception Pass, we just cant simply think of anything else it could have been.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date is approximate.

The porch light was turned off so I could get a better view of the sky.  It was lightly cloudy and the wind was at a light gust.  As I looked upward at the sky, I noticed a faint dark, grey haze that zoomed overhead.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The crescent shape (rounded side flying forward) must have been flying at least a thousand miles per hour to achieve the speed it was going.  It was out of view within a second.  The inner portion of the crescent had a slightly brighter grey hue that was almost difficult to distinguish from the color of the clouds, unless the object was in clear sky areas.  I assume that this was the propulsion agent burning off.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object I saw was judged to be roughly 6,000 to 15,000 feet above the ground.  Judging the size of the crescent, its wingspan was roughly 800 feet.  This would make the length of the craft (from center of crescent, front to back) was close to 300 to 400 feet.  The thickness of the hull (top to bottom) was possibly 100 to 150 feet.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Its coloration was very close to the coloration of the sky itself.  When I saw it, it appeared to be a trickery of light adjustment, but it was there.  And it did fly overhead. The only light emitted was the<n>

The &#34;star&#34; then seemed to fly in a slight zig/zag pattern.  As it got closer there appeared small rectangular shapes at the bottom of the object- these rectangles had a blue/grey hue to them, and there were two small flashing lights- a white one at the top and a red one at the bottom.  It flew off and disappeared.  About 15 min later another golden star was spotted (North over Kerhonkson and heading south).  This one flew in the same zig zag pattern, as it passed by we snapped some photos.  Did not see any rectangles on this one.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.  PD))<n>

Looked up in the night sky to the North and saw a series of strobe lights stationary in the sky (looked like 5 or six lights in a series) fairly low in the horizon.  As I watched a second set appeared out of nowhere and started strobing.  Both sets then strobed at once and then they both  just vanished. Did not see them move off.  They just vanished. No sound or other characteristics from the list accompanied this siting.  Lasted for about 1 minute total.<n>

While scanning the sky, I noticed moving East to West, three objects in a triangular pattern.  These objects were circular in shape, had a halo like effect with the center of them as dark as the sky around them.  The skies this evening are clear.  They moved a speed about as fast as a regional plane, but were completely silent.  Within about a half a mile from my sight, they started to shift formation and kind of intertwined each other. They may have gone about a mile West in my view, and then for a lack of better words, vanished.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

I am an ex-military wife who has lived on Air Force Bases and Naval bases so I am very familiar with military aircraft and how fast they travel.  These lights were going VERY fast and the &#34;military aircraft&#34; was not catching up to the 1st light but was obviously following it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

The 3 orbs initially appeared to be in a line that was slightly angled as if attached to a gigantic triangle/wedge suspended in the sky. Within seconds, the lights blinked off, one by one from the left to the right, in the same fashion as the &#34;Phoenix Lights&#34; over South Mtn. These were not aircraft lights. There was no sound and the sky was cloudless.These lights were very large comparatively and only white, with the estimated distance away of 3/4 mile and very, very low. 5 minutes later an arc of approximately 8 red(only)lights displayed &#34;on&#34; from left to right, held for a second and went off altogether. The position in the sky was farther away and to the southeast approx 5-7 miles. This action was observed using binoculars and re-occurred 3 more times in different areas of the southeastern sky, too far apart to be a! prank.<n> <n><n> <n><n> These were not flares or fireworks or any known craft.The distance of the last red display was approx. 20 miles away, traveling southeast over Pinal County, AZ.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I have seen more lights in Monee over the years than I have reported.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Tonight (while heading north on Rt. 50) there was a bright light that was LOW to the horizon, in fact it almost seemed like it was a low flying plane at about the 11:00 position from my vantage point. It was BRIGHT, the brightest light in the night sky and so I knew it was close and I honestly thought it would be flying overhead soon as I was driving quite fast.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I kept my eye on it while driving and it was stationary looking - it didn&#39;t rotate, it didn&#39;t zoom, it really just hovered or was moving very slowly I suppose.  All of a sudden (after about me watching it for maybe 3-4 minutes) it zoomed upwards STRAIGHT upwards (about 6 inches from my vantage point - don&#39;t know how many miles that would be in the sky) and then stayed THERE for another couple of minutes. I figured it would be moving at some point but it stayed there and then turned off completely. just as if someone turned their headlights off, the light went OUT!   I thought perhaps if it were a plane it would be going through the clouds and eventually come back out of the clouds - it never did.  I watched that area and the light did not appear again.  Whatever craft is able to just turn out the light, I&#39;d like to know.  And it was also a single solid BRIGHT white light.<n>

Light was seen, and then just disappeared.  It was as bright as the space station which we saw pass overhead earlier.  This light did not move or moved extremely slowly to the north.  My girlfriend said it was moving, I did not believe so. It was there very bright and then disappeared.  I cannot explain it. if it were a satellite it would have to have been an extremely large one to compare to the space station.  It was not the space shuttle either, we watched it pass overhead earlier this evening and the NASA website indicated only one pass.  If it did move as my girlfriend said then it was moving from south to north, perpendicular to the shuttle and the ISS orbital track.  Was very interesting.  My first thought was that it was supernova but I think it would have lasted longer.  This is the second thing I have found to meet the requirements for such a report.<n>

I live in town and our sky is dark gray at night, so the craft was visible to me.  Even though it made no sound and it had no lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was the size of a large van or small bus.  It was blimped shaped sort of, but was not a blimp.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Please do not discount me for saying it appeared almost alive.  The back end was wadded &amp; what frightened me the most, was that it had a flexible and moving feeler type object hanging underneath. I promise that I am being truthful.  The craft scared me sick.  There was something very wrong about it. It did not belong. I was awe~struck for approx. 30 seconds.  It was just passing over my roof in a southern direction, when I ran in the house to try to get my husband to come and see it. When I went back outside on the patio it was gone.  At the slow speed it was flying it could not have vanished from my range of view that quickly. I only took my eyes off it for about 20 seconds.  I wasn&#39;t going to ever report it, but only the other night a neighbor on the street behind us saw the same craft.  I never spoke of what I saw to anyone in this town.  So I know he saw what he saw and that his fear of it was as upsetting and justified as mine.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((ADDENDUM FROM SOURCE OF REPORT))<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am the person who submitted the ufo report from Farmington, Mo.  I realize my report may be deemed a hoax, because I gave no contact info.  My reasoning for not doing so, is that the craft I saw is unlike any I can find in your sightings reports.  I don&#39;t want to be perceived as a nut for seeing something that creepy.  A black craft with no lights or sound against a dark gray night sky.  With a swinging feeler type thing dangling beneath it, sounds far fetched and unbelievable.  A nearby neighbor also saw it recently, but I don&#39;t know him.  I only know of his account, because my son was walking by his house secconds after his sighting &amp; the neighbor beckoned him over to tell him about it.  The know each other through our local National Guard.  I don&#39;t know him and don&#39;t know if he would publicly verify his sighting.  I would also like to add that on seveal occasions during the past year low flying fighter jets, have roared swiftly overhead.  Horrifying sound. I don&#39;t ! believe they are suppose to have practice drills over residental areas.  The first F16 we saw &amp; couldn&#39;t help but hear, dipped and soared above our town on the same day that New Yorkers saw &amp; heard the F16s flying over the Statue Of Liberty.  Last year.  I never believed the explanation that made the news.  Something else was going on that day.  Perhaps what I saw was a government probe spying on people, or a craft being manned by drug smugglers from Canada, ballsy Russians or Chinese spying on our country or even a craft not of this world. Who knows.  All I know is that it frightened me to death  &amp; I do not trust my government enough to leave my name.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((END ADDENDUM))<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Time of the sighting is not indicated by the witness, but it seems to be a nighttime sighting.

These lights were far brighter and much larger than any star, airplane, satellite or tower I had ever seen.  It was a straight line of approximately 7-9 lights, flickering rapidly and hovering over the ridge of the mountain.  It appeared to be a disk shaped object. It was much higher than any tree or structure on the side or top of the ridge.  They were the most brilliant lights I have ever seen, and no one in my party of four could come up with a reasonable explanation for them.  Even though the photograph I took is far from doing it justice, it still shows how much brighter this object was compared to everything else in the sky.  It was still hovering when I went to bed at 12:30am, but gone when I awoke at 7:30am.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

We watched for about 3 minutes and there was absolutely no sound at all coming from the light.  The light seemed to hover and then shot off to the south and then straight up at a high rate of speed.

I usually stand on the porch itself but for some reason I decided to trek down the four steps onto the dirt drive way below.  I lit my smoke and looked to the sky like I sometimes do and noticed a small blue star to the east. Venus was clear tonight. As I stood there taking in the beauty of the stars something caught my vision.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I looked almost precisely north to see a fairly odd ball of light moving in extremely bizarre and unrecognizable motions. I stood in awe for at least twenty minutes watching the very graceful light dance around the sky, I am surely no pilot but I can most definitely recognize a passing plane or helicopter with ease. This I assure was neither. It changed colors from a light florescent white to a light blue and once in a while almost the color of the glow from a fire.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It maneuvered in and out of clouds at top notch speeds making turns I have never seen even jets make. Hair point turns around in circles and zig zags… As fast as I could hold my finger up to it and point swiveling my finger around, it moved.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I realized I was the only witness, so I ran inside to get my sister. She was skeptic of my claims at first until she stepped outside and witnessed it herself. She could not believe her eyes either! We both made sporadic phones calls; one of witch was to the local News Paper the Kennebec Journal whom witch had nothing to say but plenty to laugh about. My brother suggested I call the state police to document the incident, I obliged.  All the while this light continued to move extremely fast around the evening sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My sister went in and out of the house as my eyes stayed affixed on the orb. It seemed to travel further then closer, so on and so forth.  One of the last times my sister went back inside I saw something very piculure, the one orb had split into two, both making similar sweeping patterns over a widespread area of the northern and eastern sky.  By this time I had made my report with the police and they said someone would call me back.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I went back inside to get another cigarette and my sister to see the now two lights above. When we got back outside we looked up to see at least 4 other lights circling the sky. We watched this event for at least 30 more minutes. My sister returned inside and I followed. I got a drink and received a call back from the police officer on duty saying he was busy but he would be there ASAP. I went back outside alone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This time it was back to just two lights twisting around. One of them seemed very close. I could make out a disk shape siluette in the clouds with the lights illuminating from it. I pulled my phone out and use it as a video recorder, unfortunately it was the only piece of equipment I had. I managed to capture the original disk of light but obviously on my phone it was a tiny ball of light. It moved around my screen as I held my phone as still as possible. I went back inside.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About 10 minutes later one officer pulled in the driveway across the street from us. I went out and yelled for him to get his attention. As he turned around I looked to the sky again to see nothing but fog.  He pulled in our driveway and got out and we discussed what my sister and I had seen and I showed him the video. He seemed like he wanted to believe, but he also seemed like he had to see it to believe it.  And then it faintly returned, he watched the strange techniques of the light rome around the sky.  He admitted it was not any form of aviation he had seen, not a helicopter or plane nor a satellite because it was below the clouds.  We watched it together with my sister until it got so far away and faint we could no longer see it. We talked about it a little, he made a small report and left. That was the last time I saw the lights in the sky about 3 hours after it began it was over just as easy.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thank you for letting me post my report here.  Keep your eyes to the sky in Maine and maybe (hopefully) you will be able to verify my reports.<n>
11/15/09 18:00|Delta|OH|Light|30 minutes|Large hovering light that changed into five separate, smaller lights.|2/14/10|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/074/S74057.html|170|ndxe200911| Large hovering light that changed into five separate, smaller lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At about 18:00 on Sunday November 15th I was at work, in the forklift pulling hot steel coils off of the beam and placing them outside in the storage yard.  I looked up in the northern sky and saw an extremely bright but small light traveling east in a straight line and it just looked very wrong and out of place.  It was hard to put my finger on what was wrong about it.  The light was too bright, it didn&#39;t strobe or blink, but it was changing.  I didn&#39;t think of this at the time, it only occurred to me the next day, but I think one reason that it looked so out of place is that I see plane after plane, all night long, make their landing descents towards Toledo Express Airport, but all of those landing descents take place in the southern sky - well south of my position at work.  But this light was in the northern sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Anyway, I didn&#39;t think much of it, other than a kind of &#34;that was weird&#34; notion, and I went back inside to pull another coil off the beam.  This time when I came back to the storage yard outside, there was the brightest light I&#39;ve ever seen in my life sitting in the northern sky.  I literally said out loud &#34;Oh my God!&#34;  The brightness of it looked like someone was welding or torch-cutting the sky.  That&#39;s the best I can describe it.  If you&#39;ve ever looked at somebody welding without a visor on - it was that level of brightness.  It was stationary - it was not moving, and it was huge.  I&#39;m not good at estimating it&#39;s size but I would figure it was maybe about the size of 4 or 5 two-story houses put together.  It did not have a shape.  It was constantly changing.  &#34;Boiling&#34; is almost a good description of its manner and consistency.  It was like a bubbling glob of light in the sky.  It&#39;s colors alternated between white, red, and green.  Now I know that white, red, and gree! n are the colors of every single airplane at night but I assure you this was no airplane nor did it even remotely resemble an airplane.  It didn&#39;t have lights that were blinking or changing color, it was light and it was changing color, and it was doing so about thirty times a second.  I would compare it to when someone blows into a pinwheel.  That&#39;s how rapid the color-change was occurring.  I&#39;m also not good at estimating it&#39;s altitude but I would roughly guess somewhere around 5000 feet or so.  It was a clear night, but had there been clouds, it would have been below them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I called my coworker on the radio and asked if he was in the office.  He said that he was so I told him to step outside and look above Winchesters (the truck stop on the corner of State Route 109 and County Road H.) &#34;WHAT THE F**K IS THAT!?!&#34; he said.<n> <n><n> <n><n> &#34;Ok, I&#39;m just making sure someone else is seeing this,&#34; I said.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was absolutely amazing.  My heart was racing, my hands were shaking, and it wasn&#39;t out of any kind of fear.  It was out of excitement and out of the fact that this didn&#39;t belong or have any logical place in the sky that I&#39;ve been looking at all of my life.  This made no sense.  We watched transfixed as the light behaved the way I described above for a minute or two.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then, while we were sitting there watching it, two much smaller orbs came off of it (out of it, through it, I don&#39;t know) and began to fly independently.  The main light was stationary but these orbs came off of it and flew east.  My coworker and I started shouting and swearing like lunatics, making sure the other had just seen that happen.  After the two orbs flew off, they began to increase in size and brightness and the main light began to decrease.  Soon all three lights were the same size.  At this point, I grabbed my cell phone and called my fiance because I wanted her to go outside and see if she could see this from Swanton.  She didn&#39;t answer but she still has the voicemail I left describing the event as it was happening.  I did not think to try and take a picture but I doubt much would have shone through a cellphone camera anyway.  In hindsight, I should have tried to call everyone I know.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Soon the three lights formed the shape of a triangle and then held it for a minute or so.  Then a fourth light appeared out of nowhere.  The other three lights broke their triangle formation and began flying around.  The flying was not dramatic in the sense that they were zipping all around the sky, because that was not the case at all.  Almost all of the flying was relatively slow but it was obvious that these lights could, and were, moving in any direction they wanted.  They could fly in a direction, stop on a dime, then head back the other way.  Same thing with up or down.  It did seem very deliberate to me and impossibly exact.  It wasn&#39;t chaotic.  At one point, they formed a straight line, at another they would be jumbled together.  I don&#39;t know if there was any noise because I was in the forklift but my coworker didn&#39;t hear anything.  The most I saw was five lights flying at the same time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then, one of the lights flew in a straight line heading east, away from the rest of the lights.  Once a considerable distance away, it stopped and then dimmed completely into disappearance.  At the exact moment that it was dimming away, a new light began to shine into existence in the western sky, on the other side of the rest of the lights.  This would continue for a while.  One of the lights would fade out while another one would simultaneously fade into existence.  But that wasn&#39;t always the case.  Sometimes two would fade out and no new ones would appear.<n> <n><n> <n><n> All the while, I had work to do so I had to keep returning to the beam to grab coils but then I would sit and watch the lights for a minute or two before I would have to return to the building again.  The whole incident from start to finish was about a half hour.  The whole time it was occurring it looked like the event as a whole was slowly moving north.  At around 18:25 all I could see was one large light in the sky, just like it had started, but it was much further north than when it first appeared.  Then, around 18:30 I returned to the building to grab another coil and when I returned the light was gone and I never saw it again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Luckily I have a witness to back this story up but I didn&#39;t think that was going to be valuable or even be an issue.  I could not wait to get home to watch the news that night because I thought for sure every single person that was traveling on the Ohio Turnpike or Airport Highway (Rt. 2) had to either be calling this in or recording it.  To me, there is no way anyone traveling on either road could have missed this;  Or anyone in Fulton County, for that matter, with a view of the northern sky.  I honestly expected helicopters or airplanes to arrive at any minute to investigate.  This was too unmissable, unnatural, and bright to be missed by anyone in the area.  I thought for sure this was going to be story #1 on every single news program that night.  So you can imagine how disappointed I was that night when there was no mention of anything on the news.  To this day, I cannot find anything about strange lights or UFOs on any of the local channels&#39; or the Toledo Blade&#39;s we! bsites.  I&#39;ve also searched YouTube to see if any footage has been posted - If there has been, I haven&#39;t found it.  But I&#39;ve also searched YouTube to see if I can find any footage at all from around the world that resembles what I saw that night.  So far, I&#39;ve found a clip or two that is similar, but nothing at all that makes me go: &#34;There!  That is what I saw!&#34;  It is surprisingly frustrating.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The only tiny piece of validation I have, other than a 2nd eye witness, was a friend of mine who works at the Air National Guard base at Toledo Express Airport.  I was telling him about the sighting and he confirmed that he was working the night of my sighting and he heard a group of coworkers make the joke that &#34;Well, it sounds like the mother ship has landed.&#34;  They were discussing the UFOs in the sky that night.  My friend didn&#39;t think much of it at the time and he didn&#39;t have any other information.  He didn&#39;t know if calls were coming into the base to report the UFOs or if the base itself was able to see them on radar.  He did not know if jets were scrambled to investigate (I never saw any.)  But he did confirm that the base was at least aware that there was strange phenomena occurring in the sky on that night.<n>

I spotted something just above the tree line, three bright lights that were very intense.  Mind you that the trees were at least 100 feet tall, and we were a good 1 ½ mile from them, also it was midday and partly cloudy.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I yelled to the rest of the car what is that!?  And we came over the hill for town hall road and saw it still had not moved, we saw that about 15 other cars were pulled over on each side of the road, with everyone out staring at the object with cameras and cell phones.  We attempted to get several pictures but we couldn’t because of the low quality of my camera phone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object stayed in the same place for a good couple of minutes.  The object began to lift and as it did we all heard something that sounded like an electric engine winding up.  The object at this point was about ¼ mile away and yet it looked like it was right in front of me, I’d guess it was a few hundred feet in diameter.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The lights flicked off and I saw it had the reflectivity of polished aluminum or steel but was so light of a color that I had never seen metal that color before.  The trees below the object didn’t move as it changed from a hover to achieving lift, which was weird because it was not that high above trees directly below it.  The object then got higher and higher then it seemed to disappear.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After the object left (about 2 minutes later), we saw a dual prop plane come from the same direction the object was first sighted in, the aircraft circled the spot a few times were the object was then left back in the direction it came.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We all were left confused and with many answers, anyone who have may been there please post pictures!<n>

The noise is what woke us up it sounded like an earthquake and a jet,the house shook, I thought that perhaps my central air condition unit was on the blink, so I went outside to check. This was what I saw.  A large oval object in the dark sky,  almost like a standard blimp but much bigger and had no bottom basket as on a blimp. Color silver grey, metalic. Red lights on right and left side of object, and beams on white lights very powerful from the middle of object.  The white beams of lights were flashing. The flashing lights like those of pictures being taken, flashed in my face and I got scared and went inside and got my husband.  I purposly woke him up because otherwise if I told him what a saw at night he would think that I&#39;m flipping out or something.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My husband looked at it and we both decided to go inside the house.  We could not sleep for the rest of the night.   I was very nervous, I told my co-workers about what we saw,! and they were surprised that I did not take pictures, or call 311.  I guess I should off but I was so nervous at what I was looking at that I froze.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;m sure someone else must of seen it.  My neighbors assume that perhaps they were making a movie and this was a movie event in the sky.  People are afraid to talk about this event.  Movie makers inform  in advance that a movie will be shot at what time and ask to move all cars. There was no such request,and movies would not make such noise at that time of night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We watched from the house until it hovered away in what seemed an eternety.  No smoke, no exhaust, just noise and out.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I say it was a UFO.<n>

It was late in the night. We were 23 miles out of the next biggest town. We had passed a mile to city sign. We had both wittnesed a shooting star. It went strait down in direction. There wasen&#39;t much thought put in to it. Until we got closer to the point of where it could have landded. i looked out of the truck and at a 45 degree angle i saw a large bright flash. The flash then started to follow along side us for about a quarter to a half of a mile. we had then reached a clearing in the woods. it stopped in the middle of the clearing. the flash was a giant white no trail, no vapor,and nothing under it. It was the flash though it some howlit up every thing for miles. i could see with out restriction. I also tripple checked under the orb/flash to see if there was anything else there but to my supprise ,nothing.that is all i saw and all i know i was not intoxicated or on any type of medication. we saw the same thing at the same tim! e.well thats the report i hope you can shed some light on this.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I realize my report may be deemed a hoax,because I gave no contact info.  My reasoning for not doing so, is that the craft I saw is unlike any I can find in your sightings reports.  I don&#39;t want to be perceived as a nut for seeing something that creepy.  A black craft with no lights or sound against a dark gray night sky.  With a swinging feeler type thing dangling beneath it, sounds far fetched and unbelievable.  A nearby neighbor also saw it recently, but I don&#39;t know him.  I only know of his account, because my son was walking by his house secconds after his sighting &amp; the neighbor beckoned him over to tell him about it. The know each other through our local National Guard.  I don&#39;t know him and don&#39;t know if he would publicly verify his sighting. I would also like to add that on seveal occasions during the past year low flying fighter jets, have roared swiftly overhead. Horrifying sound.  I don&#39;t ! believe they are suppose to have practice drills over residental areas.  The first F-16 we saw &amp; couldn&#39;t help but hear, dipped and soared above our town on the same day that New Yorkers saw &amp; heard the F-16s flying over the Statue Of Liberty.  Last year. I never believed the explanation that made the news.  Something else was going on that day. Perhaps what I saw was a government probe spying on people, or a craft being manned by drug smugglers from Canada, ballsy Russians or Chinese spying on our country or even a craft not of this world. Who knows.  All I know is that it frightened me to death  &amp; I do not trust my government enough to leave my name.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Sigh<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

I heard no sound and it was fast than birds or a commercial plane.  Within a minute, it was too far away to see.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

When i parked up at my house, i walked into the town centre and saw another craft flying overhead. It was quite low down in the sky, made no noise or flashes, but looked as if it was on fire. It was a bright light so would be unusual for a plane, and it was the same as the other 2 crafts i saw driving home. It was moving about the same speed as a plane in one direction, but the fact i saw 3 of them in such a short space of time, and the way they were lit up made them seem suspicious. After looking around in the town centre i couldnt see the 2 other crafts so theyd moved off before i could look at them again. It was a clear night sky so they were very apparent and there were no clouds that could obscure them.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

At the time of the sighting, my husband and I were outside just gazing at the sky and talking.  He asked me, &#34;Did you just see those three lights.&#34;  I said, &#34;Yes, I am watching them right now.&#34;  We continued to watch.  Afterwards we notified several family members who were reluctant to believe our experience.  Here is our description of the event:  These objects were flying southwest to northeast and took approximately 5-7 seconds to fly from one side of the sky to the next.  The speed they flew appeared to be much faster than that of an airplane or other type of air craft.  The objects were all circular, bright lights, but were dimmer than stars.  They looked approximately 4 or 5 times the size that your average star appears to look in the sky.  We did not hear a sound when we saw them flying in the sky, like you would from any type of aircraft. They first flew in a formation.  The middle UFO then  flew slightly ahead of the others, and at times the other two would also briefly get out of formation.  When they shifted out of formation, it appeared quick and had a slight bounce to them.  They were very fast and flew slightly lower and higher in the sky, but all stayed near each other the entire time.  The path they took was not a straight line like you would see a falling star or an airplane do. After heading northeast! , they quickly dimmed and simply disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have never seen anything like this before and hope that others saw they same thing that we did.  The incident happened so quickly, there was no way that I would have been able to record or taken a picture of the event, but wish that I could have.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

This was a small ball of light that was bright yellow in color, completely different in shape and color from any star in the sky that I&#39;ve ever seen. It quickly appeared and shot across the sky over a military installation behind my house.  However, the path was unlike anything I&#39;ve seen too.  It shot quickly in a straight line, then moved to the left, then continued going straight again for a few seconds until it suddenly disappeared.  No plane could move that quickly, nor could it shift to the left like that.  No shooting star could do that either.  I don&#39;t know what it was, but it was so bright and unlike anything in the sky that I couldn&#39;t take my eyes off of it.  The movement was simply impossible for a plane or star - nothing moves that fast, then shifts to the le! ft that fast, then shifts straight again with no real turn or pause.  It disappeared completely without warning.  Nothing else is in the sky to obstruct my view or confuse my eyes.  I was completely frozen, standing in my driveway, watching this.  What could it be?<n>

East-Northeast(emphasis on East).<n> <n><n> <n><n> It left behind a massive white trail similar to what planes can leave behind but huge.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My husband wants me to add that it was not like an exhaust trail, but more like displacement? No other way to explain how it looked or felt but displacement.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Also as it was moving it passed in front of a plane that was much higher up and the object totally blocked the light out of the plane.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I always carry a strong flash light when we walk at night and it did not even reflect off of this object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Either it was much higher up, which means it was even larger than we think, or it was non-reflective.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We watched it from tonight 7:07 pm until 7:09 when it moved out of our field of vision.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It became a straight line like this but massively thick ______.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It seemed as though one of the diamond&#39;s points flattened to make the triangle and then the the front point of the triangle flattened to make a wide line.<n> <n><n> <n><n> If you have ever seen ticker tape or confetti that was how the tile thing looked when they were moving.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Birds do not have exhaust and that trail was not there until the object went by.<n> <n><n> <n><n> No air craft we know of is that quiet, I am a Military Brat and have grown up around planes so I know their sounds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It can&#39;t have been a Stealth because we would have felt that and it would have to have been really low to block the sky in the way it did.<n> <n><n> <n><n> No way we could not have felt it were a low flying Stealth! Also we realized after we saw the trail that in fact there were two other trails spaced evenly and parallel to the one this craft made.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

We slowed down to get a look at what it was but was unable to make out the object because of the bright lights but their was no noise from what ever the object was above us and then the lights went off and we broke sight from the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The weather conditions were clear skies at dusk - but with plenty of light in the skies to make out objects - blue skies, not complete nightfall.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object appeared to be approximately one mile in elevation and perhaps about two or three miles away from my location - straight shot.  Skies were clear, there is little to no air traffic over southwest Virginia and if there are planes then typically at very high elevations - so lights normally appear very small.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The light formation was composed of three large, horizontally oriented, oval shaped lights that were relative close to one another, like my depiction below with parentheses, and the lights appeared to wrap around the structure.<n> <n><n> <n><n> (                    )(                   )(                  )<n> <n><n> <n><n> Three things stuck out about the lights:<n> <n><n> <n><n> 1) Lights made the structure appear much larger than any aircraft that would normally fly into the private airport that is located in Blacksburg - any aircraft that would be flying that low would be flying into or out of that airport;<n> <n><n> <n><n> 2) There were no red and blue flashing lights indicating the wing tips that would be required<n> <n><n> <n><n> 3) The lights made no movement, they appeared to remain at the same point in the sky even as I drove closer towards them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Finally, the three lights simultaneously dimmed down, like a light dimmer switch you would have in a living room, rapidly until no lights remained.  At this point the sky was still light enough to make out the shape and color of any craft had the lights just been turned off, or if the lights were on the front of the craft and they had just turned a new direction that would not allow the lights to be seen anymore - but nothing remained in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I pulled into the Kips Elementary parking lot to inspect the sky but nothing was there, only two planes flying at very high altitudes not in the general vicinity of the sighting.   Whatever I saw just disappeared seemingly into thin air.<n>

At approx 11:15 pm last night I saw three low flying silent green orbs fly over at low altitude traveling from east to west directly along the normal flight path that commercial aircraft take to land in Vancouver when approach is from land. However, I am very familiar with commercial aircraft and I was not able to identify these aircraft or objects in anyway. The last of the three appeared to be a glowing disc flying through the night sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Now I am going to speculate and offer my own logical as to an explanation. I would like someone to hopefully respond with an objective opinion. Stealth aircraft have their afterburners turned up so that they are not heard easily from the ground at low altitude.  They also might have a green light on the top of the aircraft. As the afterburn of fuel from their engines is directed upwards it might have caused condensation to form thus appearing as a glowing green object from the ground in the cool temperature. I guesstimates the speed at approximately 700-1000 miles per hour yet no sonic boom which is curious indeed. However we know this technology has been worked on for years to what level of success I don’t know. We also know that a condensation halo can be formed around an aircraft at speed depending on atmospheric conditions. I am an amateur astronomist and have been for years and I&#39;ve never ever seen anything like this before either prior or post military or otherwise. I ! don’t really want to say that they were extraterrestrials but I really don’t have any explanation for this at all. I always like to error on the side of caution. However the site of these objects was really something! One more thought due to Olympics we know they’ve been flying aircraft over Vancouver city often. But not like these ones I think! Any thoughts?<n>

That&#39;s when I noticed a bright multi-colored light. It was flashing white,blue and red. It appeared to be hoovering over downtown toledo.The lights were southeast of my location,so it is actually difficult to pin point the actual location.The brightest light appeared to be hoovering and flickering multi-colored lights. There were two similar lights that went in opposite directions and by the way they moved I could tell they were not typical aircraft like helicopters or airplanes. At one point the brightest light went completely out for a period of what seemed a minute or two. The other lights eventually came back towards the main light and then moved away again. It was totally strange. I watched them for atleast a half an hour before the main light faded off into the distance.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

11/13/09 22:00|New Haven|VT|Circle|1 minute|Very strange circular craft clearly seen at close range by two people.|4/4/14|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/108/S108199.html|191|ndxe200911| Very strange circular craft clearly seen at close range by two people.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My girlfriend and I went on a date on Friday, November 13, 2009.  Directly after dinner, we drove to a rural but not uninhabited area to look at the stars.  The night was cold, so the sky was very clear.  We parked on the side of Hunt Road, a dirt road in New Haven, Vermont , sometime between 8:00 and 9:00pm.  There are houses and farms along this road, but we selected a spot where the road crests a hill, bends, and runs through a couple of wooded areas.  This helped to block any lights from nearby houses.  Hunt Road runs parallel to and one-half mile east of Route 7, a relatively busy 2-lane state highway and the main north-south road on the western side of the state.  With houses around, and a busy road less than a mile away, we were secluded but certainly not in the middle of nowhere.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We sat on the hood of my 2000 Chevy Malibu and looked at the stars for maybe 45 minutes to an hour.  We saw several shooting stars during that time.  We got cold, so we decided to go home.  We got into the car, and we were talking about shooting stars. I turned on the vehicle.  Just as I finished putting on my seatbelt, I saw something off to the left in my periphery.  When I looked, I saw an object above the trees at about 9-o’clock, directly out the driver-side door window.  I would estimate the altitude of the object at around 200 feet, and it was at a distance of about a quarter mile.  I immediately realized that it was very strange, and that I had no idea what it was.  A part of me may have already thought that it looked like the descriptions people give of alien craft.  Almost as soon as I saw it I said, “What’s that?”<n> <n><n> <n><n> My girlfriend had already seen it, as well, and she said, “I don’t know.” 	 As I said, when I first saw the thing the thought immediately popped into my mind that it looked something like a stereotypical “UFO” with a few peculiarities.  I then had the realization that of course alien craft do not exist, or at the very least that it was very unlikely that I was staring at one, so I began to try to figure out what it could be.  An airplane? A balloon? A reflection? A remote-controlled toy?  All of these things were easily ruled out almost as soon as they came up, leaving me staring at the object as it passed from the driver-side window to the windshield.  My girlfriend and I were hurriedly discussing what this thing could be, but we kept coming back to  ‘What the heck is that?  Look how it moves.’  I don’t remember if either of us said that it looked like an alien craft, but I know that we were both thinking it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The thing passed in front of the car, and it became clear that it was going to go behind some trees.  The leaves were down and it was just a row of trees, so it would still be possible to see the light moving behind the branches, but we would no longer have an unobstructed view.<n> <n><n> <n><n> By this point the objects flight-path brought it closer, and it may have been one eighth of a mile away.  My girlfriend said, “Follow it!” I said, “Are you crazy!” It moved directly in front of the car, and I reached down and flashed my headlights at it four or five times.  My girlfriend said something like, “What are you doing?” in a way that implied that I was bringing danger upon us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It began to move behind the branches just as I was finishing the last flick of my headlights, and then it abruptly disappeared. It should have been visible through the branches.  I stepped on the gas and sped past the row of trees, and behind it was an open field.  The craft should have been right there, floating over th! e center of the field heading toward the mountains, but it was gone.  There was not even a light in the distance.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We sat there scanning the area and the sky, which we had an excellent view of as we were on a hill.  The thing had completely disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object itself was shaped somewhat like a circular ibuprofen tablet.  It had flat sides and a slightly curved top and bottom.  The top was a very slightly tighter arc, and so protruded a little more than the bottom.  I believe the object was 40 feet in diameter.  Against the sky, the color of the object was a dark gray. I could see its outline very clearly.  I saw no evidence that in light the object would have been shiny, but I suppose that is possible.  I saw three rectangular lights on the flat sides that seemed to me to be windows. The lighted areas were completely opaque, and I could not see into the object at all.  The lights were all the same color, a very vibrant and yet very soft yellow.  The object did not spin around, but as it was moving diagonally to us I did see the light nearest the rear of the thing move more in front, and the light nearest the front moved around behind it somewhat due to our changing angle of view.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The strangest aspect of it, and the thing that for me rules out almost everything except for alien craft was the way that it moved. I cannot describe it to you accurately.  It moved forward and up in one motion (in ratio about 2 or 3 parts forward, one part up), and it did this in irregular “spurts”.  The spurt would be a sudden motion…no acceleration at all, it was just suddenly moving forward and up. The spurts were very short, sometimes there were three of them in one second, other times there might be 2 seconds between them.  These are maximum ranges, as there was no discernible pattern or rhythm to the timing or length of the spurts.  In between these pulses of speed, the object coasted (forward and slightly down).  Again, with no deceleration period…the object was just suddenly moving slower.  It sounds as though that would look jerky, but there was an odd fluidity to it.  Put these together, and it did not move very quickly.  It did not coast as an airplane does. It lost al! titude slightly when coasting, but there was definitely something of a hovering characteristic to it. Its general speed was not constant.  The moment that there were three spurts in one second, the thing lurched forward maybe 100 feet, but it did this in a very quick, yet intermittent fashion that is impossible to explain. It was very, very unique.  It made no noise at all.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After it disappeared and we were then unable to locate it where it should have been, my girlfriend and I agreed not to talk about it on the drive home.  The time was suddenly 11:00pm. I don’t want to say that we were missing an hour or two of time because I have misjudged time in the past, but we both wondered how it had become so late.  I do not believe I was abducted.  The plan was to get home, each make a drawing of what we thought we saw separately, and then compare.  Our drawings were identical in every way but one. I was under the impression that if we had seen it from above, it would have been a perfect circle, while she was under the impression that it would have been oblong.  The drawing of the object that I have included is the drawing I made that night, about an hour after I saw it.  The map I drew is very accurate and to scale.  Later, we researched UFO’s a bit to try to make sense of it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What we saw certainly fits in with other UFO sightings, though I have not seen a UFO photo anywhere that fits perfectly with what I saw.<n>

It was approx 100 foot of the ground. We were within 1/4 mile of it. It flew in a straight line, no rising or weaving. It was traveling 25 - 30 MPH. There was no sound . The shape never changed. I expected to see red lights on its tail, but it never changed shape or color. My wife is a school bus driver of 50. I am a business owner .  Doing grading and paving, 49 years old. We have never seen anything like this and joked about people who have. We do not use drugs. We were in the hot tub when this happened.I asked my wife to look then stepped out of the hot tub and around the side of our house to keep an eye on it.Then had to run to the other side of the deck to keep watching it fly south. The light wasn&#39;t bright. The ground did not light up. It was about as bright as an amber parking lot light from a few hundred feet away. But this one moved at 25 - 30 MPH and went from just north of Hickman to beyond wher! e we could see to the south.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Stars were also clear.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I passed Wekiva Springs Road intersection, I noticed two very bright lights in the sky. My immediate thought was two abnormally bright stars, but they were moving towards me, so I assumed jet plane. Then I realized how big (wide) this plane had to have been, and there were no blinking lights or red/green lights. Only two bright white lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It seemed to be descending, which I thought was odd, and then it started to bank hard left. My heart dropped, because I thought for sure this huge plane was about to crash land. But then I realized it stayed in the same path. Then it changed directions and banked hard right, also staying on same path. That&#39;s when it started looking like two lights rather than one object. It then spun in a complete circle while still traveling and descending, and that&#39;s when I lost it/them behind the treeline.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I looked to my right to see if any other drivers had seen, but they were distracted on their cell phones. I rushed home, my husband was outside, and I asked him if he heard or saw anything, but he did not.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It&#39;s still difficult to tell if it was one large plane with two bright lights on each wing or two separate light spheres that were flying in some sort of formation together.<n> <n><n> <n><n> All I know is that it was no ordinary plane, and they were not stars. I thought the other planes would have seen them for sure... but I haven&#39;t seen any other reports yet. This is my first time looking, though... still new to me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.  PD))<n>

I made a comment that the police must be looking for somebody because it appeared to have very bright lights, my assumption was spotlights.  We got to the intersection and it still was it seemed maybe a 1/2 mile away still, so we took a left on our intended route.  I kept watching it however and it was slowly moving towards us.  After a short time it passed directly over the top of us.  I turned the radio off and let me window down as my father opened the moonroof on the car and slowed.  It was maybe 500 ft. up and moving VERY slowly, approx. guess would be 40 - 50 miles and hour, with ABSOLUTE silence.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As it passed we could vaguely see the outline of the craft in the dark sky, which we can only describe as somewhat &#34;stealth-like&#34; and in the rough shape of a B2 bomber.  It had a very bright light on ! the front of the craft (or at least the part that was in front) and a light on each other corner.  All were white.  It did not spin or move off course in any way, almost appearing to have been fixed in its course, but once again, in dead silence and a constant speed that could have easily been kept up with in our car without breaking any speed laws.  It was very dark, I could only guess black.<n>

Out of the corner of my eye I saw 4 streaking lights.  From my location they appeared to be over the city Cincinnati, OH.  My first thought was that it was a metor shower.  The streaks appeared to be coming straight down and it looked like they were burning up as they entered the atmosphere.  The streaks disappeared and seconds later the reappeared as four solid lights.  One of the lights stayed in the same spot, and the other three were moving around.  They would fade off into the distance and then reappear.  They would also move from side to side.  I watched the objects for about two minute before all four of them finally disappead off into the distance.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

At around 7:40 pm near my home in the Cincinnati neighborhood of Westwood I viewed from the road while driving my car what looked like 3 flaming objects descending to Earth. As CKY is just across the Ohio River and a major flight path goes over my neighborhood I assumed it was a mid air explosion of a commercial aircraft. As I drove towards where the objects seemed to be descending I saw there were actually four burning fire balls moving in formation. These were not burners, they were visibly flaming and left &#39;tails&#39; as they moved. It was an irregular motion and I watched them until they moved out of view. There was a lot of other aircraft activity in the sky as well, including a low flying(and fast) military aircraft that was discernably terrestrial and several civilian aircraft mentioned above that flew much higher and served as a point of reference for both fireballs and military plan. I ca! n still hear aircraft flying overhead in my apartment as a write. Amazing. I also got a poor picture on my camera phone though it does reveal the 4 orbs.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was of course falling very rapidly on a vertical angle.  Then it began to break apart into 3 seprate peices; i thought it was just breaking up in the atmosphere but the peices did not change color or size or dim down.  then all three peices immediatly stopped rapidly falling in only a second.  They stopped on a perfact diagnal line.  Then they gradually started moving slowly at the same speed on a horazontle direction.  Then the bottom (lowest to the ground) lights began to desend towrds the ground, but the top one stopped moving and hovered oner the treeline for about a minut.  Then all three objects immediatly vanished from the sky.  There were no flashing lights on any of the objects.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I yelled for my wife to get my camera but she did not hear me so i went and got it and was able to film about 20 seconds of it before it went behind the trees.  It did not make any noise and i did not see any wings or rotor blades.  It was possibly 1000 feet or more in the air.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have looked at the video frame by frame and at frame 95, there seems to be 4 or 5 dark &#34;saucer&#34; shape objects that appear and then &#34;fly off&#34;.  It was flying to slow for a plane and it wasn&#39;t a star or planet.<n>

My wife and I were in bed watching some television. While in bed we both saw and heard a bright light pass from one side of the window to the other.  The really weird thing was the buzzing sound it made.  The only way I could explain the sound would be like an electrical buzz.  My wife and I talked about the event for a second to make sure we both heard and saw the light.  Then we headed down stairs to see if we could see anything.  Well we found nothing. My wife and I have never had an experience like this.<n>

My wife is a nurse at a hospital in Wichita,KS about 40miles north of where we live.She arrived home as normal at 3am.<n> <n><n> <n><n> She woke me up, and told me there was a plane with abnormal lights hovering above the house.  I was skeptical, but woke up anyways.  I went outside, and what I witnessed is a large &#34;object&#34; with three orange fire like lights in a triangle like position.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object was in my opinion the size of a medium sized house.  I realized it was not an airplane nor helicoptor when it did not emit any sort of sound and just &#34;hovered&#34; silently.I live out in the country so I have no close neighbors so I was pretty frantic, so I called the police.  While I was on the phone with the 911 operator, the object I don&#39;t know how to describe it but the object shot into the sky like a slingshot leaving a orange glow for a few seconds..<n> <n><n> <n><n> When the police arrived I made a report and that&#39;s all, the officer said it was probably a meteor but it was not a meteor.  I am a well respected dentist and my wife is a well respected nurse, and we are not the kind to make up such foolish things.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I found this site and maybe by writing this somebody can tell me what this was…<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  I hope someone will inform the Harper Police Department that meteors do not hover, or hang around, for 5 minutes.  They are visible because they pass through the atmosphere at 8-50 miles per second.  PD))<n>

As I was looking just above the western horizon, an unusual light caught my eye.  I watched this orange ball of light for approximately three minutes.  The really weird thing, and the reason that I&#39;m posting this, is that the light simply vanished right before my eyes -- poof and it was gone!  I&#39;ve never seen a light just disappear like that.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A small airplane did appear in that part of the sky about five minutes later, but its lights were red and green, typical landing light colors, NOT the firey orange that I observed with the spherical light a few minues earlier.

I work in Fort Worth, but live in Denton and I was traveling on I-35W heading north.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I was reaching the Ponder area I noticed what looked like a bright falling star go directly straight for the earth in the north (straight ahead).<n> <n><n> <n><n> I thought it was a falling star until I saw the light go out and then immediately come back on, but it was stationary.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then I watched as it flew (about as fast as a jet) straight west, then turn straight east. As this was happening, it would sporadically get dimmer, then really bright (brighter than a typical star).<n> <n><n> <n><n> I watched it turn west once more, then it hovered in one spot, just west of I-35. Then I saw it slowly go down and, I assume, land.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was bright as it landed, and I could see the trees around it as it descended. What amazed me was it&#39;s ease of turning directions, without slowing down.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I finally got up and looked out our bedroom window to see what was going on, immediately my eyes were drawn to the sky southwest area, I was shocked at first as the light was so bright-like a star that appeared to be moving towards me, then pulling away, but all in the same space. I kept looking in awe, the light seemed to have bluish green lights coming out from it-it at first appeared to be in a star-cross shape-then spherical and at times seemed to be a triangle.  It also showed red lights at times. I was in such awe and realized it was NOT a commercial or military aircraft. Off to the South I saw an airplane- looked to be commercial, but noticed that it circled on the outskirts several times. I then realized I was definitely looking at a UFO- and perhaps that was a military plane circling since we live so close to the ai! rforce bases and often see military craft flying over our home.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Either way, this was intriguing and I knew I had seen something similar when I was 9 yrs old in Richmond, Ky over our neighborhood-the way it moved and the lights very similar except this seemed to me more advanced in movement and color from what I saw as a child.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am wanted to report this because I am 100% sure this was nothing of man made origin. I do have a FLIP video of it I would love to share and have analyzed. IT did not zoom in far enough for details, but YOU CAN SEE THE COLOR CHANGES AND ERATIC MOVEMENT, diagonal, up, down, across, houvering, etc…  I finally went to sleep around 10:40 and the craft was still there, do not know how long it had been there prior to my sighting or how long after it remained. I would love to know if others saw this in the area---someone had to, especially the commercial or military craft I saw circling on the outskirts.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Twinkling star??

We stopped to observe it by the south end of town.  We obsevred the craft and seen that it was tear-drop shaped and that at the round bottom there were for lights one in front, one in back, and two on each side.  we had only seen the shape of the craft because of the lights on the craft.  The bottom of the craft where the lights were situated spun making the lights flicker.  This craft wasn&#39;t anything that we had both seen before.  We observed the lights in the same for about 20 minutes.  It then moved a little to the west and stayed in that place for about 5. In the last remaining minutes we seen the craft disappear.<n>

Four equal (but smaller) orbs appeared with what appeared as red &#34;tails&#34;.  For the next 14-15 minutes we watched as these four lights spiraled downward - towards the Ohio River - in a slow, spiral descent.  Once arriving into Newport, Kentucky we could no longer see the lights - they had disappeared over the mountainous horizon - presumably into the River.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Right after I was able to see again I looked towards where the light came from only to see a small light (White in color) in the sky flying North at a very high rate of speed.

While standing on the back deck of the house I noticed what first appeared to be a bright star in the north western part of the sky, maybe fifteen degrees from the horizon.  This places it over Lake Ontario. The light was a white-yellow, slightly larger than the visible stars at the time.  It moved at a constant, blazing speed, from northwest to south.  It appeared too far out in space to be a satellite and traveled too fast.  The object did not burn up or gravitate towards earth, but continued in a straight line through space.  In about forty-five seconds it had covered the entire horizon and faded away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;ve never seen a satellite behave in such a fashion and if anyone else noticed this event, I&#39;d love to hear your thoughts.<n>

I was in the front yard walking my dog. It was a clear night, I looked up in the sky and the first thought that went thru my mind was “that is biggest oddest star I have ever seen” before I could complete that thought it started to move, my next thought was I wish a plane were in the sky to compare size against. I was facing my home this thing was initially to my left (West) and started to move right (North).  I looked at the direction this thing was moving. There were two commercial planes one headed in the opposite direction parallel the other perpendicular all looking as if they would eventually cross the same line in the sky (not a collision).  This item was about four times the size of the commercial jets; I cannot say if they were flying at the same height that is just how it appeared. This thing started to go faster and when it hit that line in the sky where they would all cross ! it shot up at an angle and it was gone.  The initial size was the size of a dime at arms length when it shot up, it went to a dot in less that a second.  There was no glare, halo effect, or streaking it appeared to be white in the sky and round in shape. It reminded me of the magic trick where a ping pong ball moves along a black piece of cloth.  I did not want that moment to end it was amazing. More planes appeared quickly; about five more in total all crossing around the area where this thing disappeared. A military style jet passed over much lower right over my house. It came from the Northwest headed Southeast.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object was only in my sight for around five seconds and the time it took for all the planes to come and go was a total time of around two minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The approximate latitude of my location was 40.5546920 and longitude was -79.7526617 about 20 miles to the North of Pittsburgh PA. To be somewhat discreet I did not use my exact address to come up with the latitude and longitude.  I hope there are some FAA records of this event and it can be investigated.

I am a 9 year Army Helicopter Crewchief Vet from the Persian gulf and have worked in aviation at Boeing for 15 yrs and grew up working at my cousins airfield so I feel I have been exposed to our capabilities and what we saw is outside of what I would consider possible with our technology.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Never in combat nor training have I seen a craft move at this speed with the exception of our own space missions when visible from the ground. . It was approx 3 - 4 miles up moving at about mach 3 or greater. The thing that made me interested and know this was not a fighter nor NASA project was the fact that it started making zigzag&#39;s in a continuous perfect W form for about 30 seconds without slowing and then made a 90 degree turn to the east and shot straight up until the light became so small in size it was no longer visible.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We heard absolutely no sound but at it&#39;s height I did not expect to hear anything.<n>

We decided it wasn&#39;t a star when it started pulsing and flashing blue and green.  It was fairly far away but it was a perfectly clear night.  It moved fast in a zig zag pattern and then moved up fast, and stayed there for a while, not moving.  This morning we got up again to look before the sun came up and it was in a different place again, but it was still there.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I layed down in my bed to check emails and schedule on my cellphone, and about 0h45 i observed through the window some lights flying above my building. I ran to the window thinking that could be an airplane, but the air traffic goes until 11p.m.<n> <n><n> <n><n> For several seconds while the object was pretty near from my building i could see clearly a rectangle object with four white immobile lights in the corners, and two red flashing lights on the bottom, these two red lights flashing different from each other. The object made no-sound, it was flying in low altitude, it was smaller and fasten than an airplane. It appears in east and went west, and i observed that thing until it disappears in the horizon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I tried to film it but unfortunatly i couldnt, i was in shock.<n>

On the early morning of 10/11/2009 at about 12:35am I was let my dogs outside to do their thing and stood outside of my house right outside of my front door.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was a cold, dry and clear night and the stars were more visible than I have seen from here, so I gazed up at them. After about 10 – 15 seconds I happened to look straight up above me when it came into view.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What I saw were 3 light blue, gray balls of light. Not bright lights, more soft.  It was 300 – 500 feet in the air, and flying in a triangular formation at a very slow, but still “cruising” speed. It was completely silent and headed Southeast.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About 2 seconds past and the made a spin move around eachother one time, then went exactly back into the triangle formation.  Then the light blue/gray orbs turned into just light gray and immediately, but very slowly, faded out. I could no longer see the orbs.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I let my dogs in and I then had a very strange/ eerie feeling as if someone were watching me, or having a sense of someone in the room. Like the feeling you get when you turn on your TV with the sound off. I was pretty startled and jumped back inside and slammed the door shut and locked it while my arm shook furiously (I was that freaked out).<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I sat down to immediately start researching what I had just saw, I still had the strong sense of a presense behind me to the point I feared even turning around.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am glad I have seen one of these ufos, and after much research I have discovered a nearby “ufo hot spot” where people have reported seeing triangular ufos about 12 miles from where I live in a town called Lucky Point. I have also discovered reports of the same ufos 1 week ago 3 hours west of here.<n> <n><n> <n><n> For a glimpse of what I saw, please google “STS 115 objects” to see the live NASA TV video of the same triangular orbs. Also google “St. Petersburg Russia triangle ufo” to see a cell phone video of the same orbs and many other people witnessed. Both occurred within the last 2 weeks before my sighting.<n>

Checked my eyes, re-found object again, thought was a plane, but thought it was way up there. After watching for planes long enough you notice the differences. The object moved over to the left at a weird angle, stalled and then went up at 118 degrees. And when I say up I mean Galactic. I was as if you could see it leaving the Solar system.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Occurred between 17:00 and 18:00 (5-6pm central).  Flying very low.  Had a low humming sound.  For a plane/helicopter to be that low, it would sound louder.  Was sherical or oval in shape.  Expected to see a tail on a plane if it were a plane, but saw none and it wasn&#39;t a plane.  Had flashing red light and two other white lights on it.  It was southwest bound.  Appeared to be light in color (white?)   Watched it travel southwest.  Was flying in a horizontal position and then appeared to travel at a slanted angle.  Flew behind tree line and continued to southest destination and beyond tree and house lines.  It traveled at a very slow pace the whole time.  I chose to write this because there is another one here that is similar and could be related to this one.  Siting was at my house outside my window across from KOMU TV station south of Columbia by Hwy 63.<n>

(There were No Clouds anywhere around it)I stared in amazement and did not attempt to distact the driver at that time...thinking maybe this is just something that is explainable...no camera...but...before I could get my! cell phone to take a picture... it seemed to slowly dissappear back where it came from ...with no movement ,except a little fog taking it back up ,into and above, the blue sky??? At first I thought maybe a satellite had come into orbit and then back out??? But this is not possible, and they are not gold and as detailed as I saw... after researching...this thing was big ,it was so detailed and defineatley a large metal object...I am dumbfounded and at the same time want to know what it was...<n> <n><n> <n><n> I waited because I am just scared to tell people what I saw....<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was almost directly above us and it was no longer a bright white light but an oval shaped craft with a square compartment on the bottom that was spinning clockwise.  There were 4 colored lights on the bottom (2 red and 2 blue) after looking at it for about 2 minutes it vanished.  My eyes couldnt stop watering for about an hour.

VERY bright, was in a straight line time facing NNW.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The light was white with a tinge of blue, light itself was the straight like a bar bell with 2 lights on the end.<n> <n><n> <n><n> IT had a smaller light on each end of the bar that were identical in shape. There was a light, then a small space then light. This composed the SMALL light at each end.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then there was the middle BAR light which was about 5x the length of the small end lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Had a middle longer bar then the light like the video again in a straight line.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Since it was there for about 30 minutes or more as I was watching it, I was hoping it might be there for a while longer, so I rushed home to get a camera and my Night Vision Monocular.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I got back, it was there for only about30 seconds more, I couldn&#39;t even set up the camera to take any video then it disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I waited until after 9:20pm to see if it would come back but I didn&#39;t see it anymore.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Just before 9pm, still looking in the area of the sky where it was using my Night Vision Monocular, I suddenly saw a DOT just like a small star moving in a straight line and immediately thought it was a Satellite as I have spent countless nights star gazing and see satellites every 5 minutes sometimes which is nothing unusual.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This light however  stopped going straight, slowed down smoothly, but quickly, and turned, started flying around that area with incredible speed and maneuverability, it&#39;s very difficult to describe the type of movement...it was FAST, reactive, but still smooth flying, not like a bug or bird or anything I&#39;ve ever seen....keep in mind I&#39;ve star gazed for decades, have owned numerous telescopes, so I&#39;m familiar with what I can see out there, this was like nothing I&#39;ve ever seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This point light looked to be very high as it was in FOCUS with the stars, anything very close would be out of focus on my Night Vision as it&#39;s manual adjusted focus so it had to be quite distant.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This light then darted off in a straight line after the maneuvers, and the lights from the street and buildings flared up the Night Vision and I couldn&#39;t view it anymore as there were street lights everywhere.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The whole time I was yelling out &#34;that&#39;s impossible&#34; etc, I couldn&#39;t contain myself.<n>

Across the street from my house. My dog broke out of our back yard and I went out of the house to retrieve him. I was able to get him and at the same time from about 120 feet away I saw three bright white lights and a dime one in the center hovering over my neighbors house approx. 20 feet over his house near a tree.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The night was cold and misty the sky very cloudy so it was resting in the cloudy mist that hung some where about 25 to 30 feet above ground, my neighbors house is on a little hill so it is higher than ours. This object was floating like it was observing my dog and I from the distance, and when I notice it, it started to move. It moved very slowly my guest would be about 5 miles per hour and it made no sound and moved as if gravity had no force on it at all. The other strange thing is the very bright white lights on it did not illuminate the trees around it as it glowed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I first noticed it I thought it was an airplane because I live 15 miles from Birmingham&#39;s AirPort, but the object was quiet and it did not have the normal light features that an airplane would have like the small red and green lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After, it had pass over and disappeared in the cloudy mist a real airplane flow over my head with the red and green lights that I mentioned and it was very loud. I have always believed in them but I am truly convinced that they are real now. My only concern is why are they more noticeable now. Something major is going to happen down the road for us I do believe.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

There were no stars that night due to cloud cover.  The object was a blinding white light not moving at all.  There were no standard blinking lights on it like normal aircraft and it was brighter then anything ive ever seen. It must have been as big as a 747.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As it continued to hover it suddenly changed direction and began to slowly turn hover at an angle upward.  This caused a reflection from the craft on the clouds that made my stomach churn.  As it turned and the light reflected off the cloud it was clear this was no normal craft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As it began the same flight path it suddenly vanished.  At first I thought it went behind a cloud but I still would have been able to see that bright light through the cloud,  I swear it just disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Now since about 30 minutes earlier I had passed through the town of Norwood Missouri, I wasn&#39;t surprised that I saw a UFO,  Norwood is a really famous spot for sightings/cow mutilations.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Ive seen about 9 UFO&#39;s in my life and I swear I saw another one last night.  I know more people had to have seen it, the light was so bright.<n>

I am not saying it was a ET UFO, but it was most certainly unidentified.  On November 9th 2009 at aprox 9:00pm I viewed an object that looked triangular in shape with a light on each corner.  I live on the top of Queen Anne in Seattle and see passenger planes flying over hourly on any given day.  The object I saw seemed to be a ~25% larger than a regular jet, and the speed was 50-75% the speed of usual jets flying over.  With help from google earth, I have tried to put the estimated coordinated of what I saw,  Starting at 47 37’56.35”N 122 22’06.94W traveling on a path towards 47 37’16.37”N 122 21’34.11W.  I viewed it until my view ended because of a building.  Also, I did not hear sound coming from the craft<n>

I was out having a smoke with my significant other on our balcony in highland park (located more west of town).  I was observing the sky as I saw a bright orange light get very bright and then fade out towards the southern edge of town.  After a very small fraction of a minute another bright light of the same magnitude appeared, flashed and faded out; more towards the east of town this time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> These flashes were seemingly popping out of the sky in very random locations.  Two more occured; one seemingly higher in the air, then another south of town again.

The balls of light were spaced roughly 500 yards apart from one-another. After a little while the middle light began to fade. When this light had almost entirely &#39;switched-off&#39; it quickly gained altitude, regained its vivid light and hovered in the same place for a little while. Soon the surrounding two lights followed the central light upto the same altitude. For about 10 seconds the lights hovered there in a row before shooting south at an unmeasurable rate of speed. It was hard to focus on the light as it was too bright and blurry for most of the time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

There were three lights in a line, flying pretty low and fast, from north to south.  (many planes were in the sky also, so it was easy to compare, and these looked completely different.)   Each light was large elliptical shaped and seemed to be moving independently, while flying in formation.  There also seemed to be a pulse that went back and forth through all of them.  It &#34;pulsed and shimmered,&#34; as if you were seeing them through a mirage or a film of steam.  Before the three of them disappeared behind some clouds, the last light seemed to speed up and align itself to the right of the front light, forming a triangle.<n>

Last night was the 2nd or 3rd time my 13 year old has seen these lights in the night sky, but my first full experience.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were driving home and the lights just appeared (there were other planes flying in the area and these were not the same kind of lights).  They had a sort of yellowish glow and there were 3 at first in a triangular shape all the same brightness and then they just faded out, next they lit up one at a time but in 3 different spots and then just faded away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After that, the lights took the shape of a half moon and lit up one right after the other in rapid succession from top to bottom then bottom to top (sort of like a tail of a huge firework, there were none in the area).  After the half moon shape, they lit up straight up and down lighting up in rapid succession again and then fading out, followed by the lights lighting up in 3 different spots again shaped sort of like a triangle and then fading out.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We weren’t close enough to see anything other than the lights, but my 13  year old has seen this same thing before above the field in the back of our home???<n>

Traveling SE on I10, right upon merging I noticed a bright disk glowing white, red and blue.  I estimate it was at around 40~50 thousand feet.  I immediately check my iphone application to see if there were any planets visible.  I did notice that Jupiter was directly due south at an alt of 40 degrees.  This light source was due east over what I would estimate to be over San Manuel, AZ.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After 10 minutes of my wife and I observing this light, we noticed the flashing strobes from military aircraft either from Davis Monthan AFB or the Guard Unit at Tucson International.  The military aircraft moved fast towards the craft, which hovered the whole time.  When the military craft approached, the craft rose up immediately and disappeared into the darkness.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We noted times, places and conditions.  Then we starting thinking about an interesting sighting my wife and I experienced much earlier in our trip.  We were heading east on I10 near milepost 170 due south of Phoenix when I looked to the west, admiring the sunset (5:25pm), when I noticed what appeared to be a plasma arc about a few miles from the highway, which blinded me.  My wife asked me what I saw and I pointed in the direction.  Then a few seconds later the plasma arc showed itself again.  The &#34;arc&#34; appeared to be in the direction of AZ347, but prior to reaching it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I work for an airline and am familiar with altitudes, various aircraft and their capabilities.  What we say this day was nothing I&#39;ve ever seen before.  We live near Davis Monthan AFB in Tucson and are exposed to military aircraft on a daily basis.  The craft we say was not military or private.  Nothing I know of moved as fast and disappears from military jets with such ease.<n>
11/9/09 01:00|Maniwaki (Canada)|QC|Other|few hours|Strobing light, multiple colours, near Maniwaki, P.Q. (130kms North of Ottawa)|12/12/09|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/073/S73376.html|244|ndxe200911| Strobing light, multiple colours, near Maniwaki, P.Q. (130kms North of Ottawa)<n> <n><n> <n><n> Around 0030 hours on Thursday, November 19th 2009, I went outside to smoke a cigarette and a bright white light caught my attention; it was distinctly brighter than everything else in the sky. As I paid closer attention to it I noticed a sort of red light emanating from one of its sides and a bluish hue that seemed to be on the underside of the object. It appeared to be hovering but was not completely stationary, it kept repeating a kind of circular, or wave pattern, at regular interval, about every two or three minutes. I was puzzled by it and ended up staying outside for 45 minutes-or-so, observing it circle around in a similar fashion to a mosquito, or a fly, or something.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was getting cold, so I decided to go back inside to get binoculars or something but I don’t have very powerful ones so figured they would not be of much use. I went back outside less than an hour later (around 01:45) and, to my surprise, the object was still there hovering around. The white light was still bright but the red and blue ones had become intermittent, only visible for short periods of time over several minutes; the predominant light (white one) appeared to have acquired a yellowish-orange color. (The first time I was outside it remained a very bright, clear, white; aside from the red and blue lights/reflections or whatever they were)  The object appeared to be so far, and high up, I can’t even estimate the distance or the altitude other than it was a good couple kilometers up in the sky and at least 15kms away from my position. I don’t really know what to say about the shape because it didn’t always look the same: sometimes the bright white light was shaped kind of like the letter “C”, sometimes it looked more triangular in form and the rest of the time like a cylinder standing on its end. There did seem to be two distinct parts to the object, though, like there was something obstructing the light in the middle?? At some point when it was closer the first time I saw it, I thought I saw like a kind of pompon on the top but I wasn’t able to see that again so it could have been some effect with the light. Also, the main light was throbbing, it would get a little dimmer and become bright again; this cycle lasted about 1 or 2 seconds, like a kid flipping a light switch continuously (this was observable the who! le time).<n> <n><n> <n><n> The sky was completely clear: I observed numerous meteorites entering the atmosphere and burning up and at least one plane (what appeared to me as being a commercial passenger aircraft) that seemed to get pretty close to the object, albeit a considerable distance below it. Around 0300 hours I decided to get back inside as the object had not done anything else than dim/brighten and enter hovering patterns in the previously stated fashion. There was no audible sound whatsoever from the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It had three lights on each tip of the triangle and a red flashing light on the top of triangle. It was going a steady pace and within 90 seconds it was out of sight. It seemed to be going way faster than a plane and flying very steadily.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I have always been somewhat skeptical about UFOs, but until the night of November 8th 2009 (I believe) I saw something completely incredible!<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was walking out of my girlfriends house to kiss her good night at around 8:12 pm. We looked across the lake up towards the mountains and noticed what seemed to be two sets of headlights (meaning four headlights total)  coming through the sky( I thought it was coming down the mountain but that was about 6 miles away) my girlfriend too thought it was a car way off in the distance, so she walked inside. I stood there for a few moments noticing the lights getting closer and closer.  I noticed a man jog by as I was staring at these lights, which were now only 100 yards away from me and getting closer.a sound of a VERY HIGH PITCHED jet engine came closer and closer(it was so high pitched it was almost a whistle) by this time I was looking straight up in the sky a! t this thing directly overhead me. It had a helicopter shaped body but with wings that were slanted downwards at a slight angle, and at the end of these wings were large “fans” which appeared to be angled down causing the fans to act as propellers. But under the main body was a jet (meaning I saw a small flame shooting out of the bottom which was maybe 2ft long) the object in question seemed to be about 30 ft long with a twenty foot wingspan and was only flying 50 FT OVER THE TREELINE. It proceeded to keep its pace which seemed to be about 100-150 mph  I then ran into my girlfriends house screaming and yelling when I told them what I saw and heard thet were amazed because they couldnt hear this thing fly over. In all my experience living around planes, I have NEVER seen anything like this…the guy who was jogging said he thought it was a low flying B12 bomber or something…but it wasn’t that big. I don’t know if this is alien craft but It looked man made…but either way it was! unidentified. There were no blinking lights just one light on! the bot tom and the four “headlights”. this is not a joke or scam. You may Email me at ((e-mail address deleted))<n>

As I walked down my street, and turned the corner of my block I noticed a mostly red and white glowing object in the sky moving away from me. I am near the San Francisco airport, so I am used to the planes flying overhead all the time, but this was not a plane, I was sure if it.  It glowed, but did not flash, and had no other colors present like the aircrafts I see with the red, white, and blue lights which are always present. I stopped in my tracks, and just focused on the object which was slowly moving away from me. I tried to see if this was a plane, but seen no wings, or flashes, just the bright glow of the red and white light which looked like a mini fireball in the sky.  About a minute and a half passed as it moved farther and farther away from me, then all of a sudden like a switch, the light turned off. I can still see the object moving, but no visual light was seen.  Just a spot! at this point till it got so far away I could no longer see it anymore.<n>

Owners of the bull are Bill and Linda Wilson, Burr Oak.  The bull was found by the Wilsons on Sunday.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When the bull was found the animal’s ears, eyes and tongue were among the body parts apparently removed.  Blood was not found around or on the carcass.  The carcass was examined by a veterinarian and a full investigation begun.  The killing may have been part of a cult related ritual, but this has not been proven.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The sheriff’s department learned two days prior to this incident in Jewell County a similar incident was reported near Colorado Springs.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The Wilson’s bull was in a gated pasture with other cows and calves but none of the animals were killed.

Never seen anything like this before.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On, 11/07/09, around 8:54pm, a friend and I were riding west on Dixie Highway in Ft. Mitchell, KY. As I looked up to the West, towards the airport, I saw three objects that I thought were shooting stars. They seemed like they were falling to Earth from the sky. However, the 3 lights took a turn up. I kept saying to my friend, do you see what I see? Do you see this? My friend thought the items were fireworks. I told him that fireworks are shot up from the ground. I told him these items came downward. Then we became somewhat nervous. As an African-American man, it is rare that we see these types of objects, or at least publicly tell someone. I work for an air line and I tried to tell myself that it was a plane or maybe someone was playing with a flare. However, the lights started to make all kinds of shapes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The three lights became four and made a triangular shape. Then the lights just hovered. Afterwards, the lights became five and made an angle like this &gt;. Then it just hovered. I had stopped driving at this time to watch. After a few minutes of watching I started driving again. I was going to take I-75 north to Cincinnati, but I continued down Dixie Highway going west then north. The light was so bright. By the way, I called 911 to tell them what I saw. They just blew me off, but I was very serious. I know people had to see what I saw. After we headed down Dixie Highway, the lights just disappeared. We continued to look for them, but could not find them. I had never seen anything like this in my life.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had always seen these events happen on television, but I did not expect to see this in my own community. I am very skeptical of people who claim to see UFO’s. I do not know what it was I saw, but I know it wasn’t a flare, not making all of those formations. I know it wasn’t a plane. I fly on them often. I know what I saw wasn’t fireworks. There was a cloud in the sky when we witness these lights. It was a clear night. I wish someone would investigate this. I know someone had to see what I saw. I am so glad I had a witness<n>

The object consisted of four lights in the sky, formed by two lights in a line, and two more on opposing sides below the second light; much like a dotted star without two of the points.  The lights were stagnant in the sky, and on two occasions in the approximate five minute period, one of the lights went out, then proceeded to turn back on.  What appeared to be an aircraft of some type was following the lights, this craft came closer towards us, then went the opposite direction.  As it was nighttime, this object could not be identified, but was assumed to be a helicopter.  The &#39;helicopter&#39; disappeared right after the lights went out.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I decided to take a couple of photos of the aircraft, despite having only a 24-70mm zoom.  Of the three photos I took, one includes an unknown yellow or gold object at an unknown distance.  I didn&#39;t see this object until I viewed my photographs one week later.  At the time of the photo, the aircraft did not interact with or chase the object.  Probably didn&#39;t see it.  I know I didn&#39;t see it at the time.  My first guess is an airborne hat, much close to me than the aircraft.  But, since I can&#39;t tell, I thought I would sent along this report.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Photo settings: Nikon D700, Nikon 24-70mm 2.8 lens at 70 mm.  F11, 1/1000, ISO 800, 0ev bias.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

At a closer look you could see flashing red lights moving in a circular motion horizontally.  After a few minutes the object started to fade and eventually disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When it was first noticed, it looked as if the light from the moon was being reflected off of the object.  It&#39;s shape was not very distinct, but appeared flat and round.  We have recently been interested by this subject and are not sure if this has played a role in our sighting.

The lights were different from the lights used on light aircraft (i.e., the position lights consist of an Aviation Red light on the left side, an Aviation Green light on the right and an Aviation White tail light).  There were no position lights and no aircraft noise was audible, just the bright white strobe effect from three different positions in the sky.  The distances changed and shifted, but a triangular pattern of some sort was maintained, and after about 8 minutes one of the lights split into two. I watched for several more minutes until they all vanished into the distance over the foothills.  Other planes were in the area and could be recognized by their normal aircraft position lights.  The sighting lasted approximately 12 minutes<n>

It was dark out and I happened to look up. I saw a large white light, larger than a star or visible planets. It seemed to zig zag at high speed and then stop. It did this for a few minutes, darting back and forth. I noticed the color change from white to a golden yellow. It then became bright red. As it changed to red, it was stationary but also appeared to get smaller. It vanished right in front of my eyes. I thought that I was going crazy and told my fiance who was at work. He called me later and told me that I wasn&#39;t going crazy. One of his co workers was asking if anyone saw the strange light and described the same thing that I had seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was while my daughter and I had driven into the McNeil High School parking lot to pick up my son after school that my daughter observed a strange object in the sky.  She asked me what it was as it was getting closer to us, and I looked at it carefully before responding because I didn’t want to make more of it than was necessary in case it was an identifiable craft.  However, upon close inspection, I could not see a tail fin or wings on what appeared to be a cigar shaped object, slightly larger in the front, and made up of two colors, orange and silver.  The object was moving from a West to East direction in a fairly straight line, about 2 miles up in the air.  I opened the car window to get a clearer view, and did not hear any sound.  There was no contrail or anything else to suggest this object was “normal”.  It was moving about the same speed as what you would expect an! airplane, except it looked much smaller than a plane, and as I said, did not have wings.  I managed to snap two pictures out of the car window (no glass or obstruction of the shot) which I&#39;ll be happy to send to you as a reply to acknowledgement of receipt of this report.  The camera used is a Canon PowerShot SD890 IS Digital Elph. A little while later, I did notice an airplane flying by on approach to Austin’s Bergsrom International Airport, and it was clearly much bigger and the wings were clearly visible, and the sound was clearly audible, a stark contrast to the unusual object we had just witnessed.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

While i was driving something caught my eye it looked like it might even be a bird, while driving i kept looking up at the object and realized this was no bird. It was really strange a metallic object that was just hovering. It seemed as if it had no flight pattern and would hover and move with no direction, its hard to explain almost like a ballon. It was so interesting, I tried my hardest to watch it and keep my eye on the road, if your familair with tampa traffic. As i got closer to the object it looked like a cigar like a 50 gallon drum floating in air,my best description. To be quite honest it was kind of scary, I was so close to calling the police, but wouldnt you know it two fighter jets came out of know where and started circleing the object, I got off 275 and headed towards clearwater and lost sight of the object. Im telling you something happened today, and pr! oably most people didnt see it because it was rush hour and they where paying attention to the road. I have always been skepitcal about alien bullshit, and goverment cover up but this was real people. There must have been other witness!<n>

11/6/09 03:00|Saquarema (Rio de Janeiro) (Brasil)||Light|~ 10 seconds|Orangeyred lights 3 in a triangle equidistant were still, no sound, same shape zoomed off horizontally altogether|2/14/10|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/074/S74103.html|273|ndxe200911| Orangeyred lights 3 in a triangle equidistant were still, no sound, same shape zoomed off horizontally altogether<n> <n><n> <n><n> The following is the photograph that stays in my mind from my first UFO experience:  I was awake lying in a hammock outside on the veranda, right next to the house, talking with a friend under a clear starry night. This was early on November 6th, 2009 in Saquarema, a beach town in Rio, Brasil with only low rise homes. It was quiet and dark all around except for one light inside the room on my right. My friend was sitting by a table on the same veranda and stepped inside for just a couple of minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> First sitting:  This was around 03:00 or later and as I leaned my head back on the hammock I looked straight up and saw 3 reddish orange lights, shaped in a triangle, equidistant from each other, all the same size, approximately the size of a nickel coin at arm’s length.<n> <n><n> <n><n> These 3 lights were not moving, just still in one same spot, strong lights but not shinny nor flickering, each one was the same and had no variation of color.<n> <n><n> <n><n> From the angle I was looking (up) they were in an arrow shape and I can’t remember if this way  : -   or this way  - :  , and I was quiet, analyzing what I was looking at when just before my friend stepped back to the veranda, these lights all of a sudden, altogether in the same shape took off to the right at lightning speed, they did not leave any streak behind, and I could not follow them further because the roof of the house created an obstacle to my view. This entire sighting seems to have lasted only about 10-15 seconds, just enough to appreciate it. There was no sound from the lights the entire event.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Second sitting:  I immediately made a comment to my friend of what I had seen pointing in the direction of where the lights had gone but at the same time I looked around the sky when I spotted another single light, of a smaller size, about the size of a dime coin at arm’s length but white, it was further away and not overhead and located in the opposite direction from where the other 3 orangey red lights had gone. This whiter light was similar to the color of any big star in the sky but bigger, and it was also standing still when I saw it, just bright, not flickering, and just as I was guessing it was not a star it zoomed off horizontally that other way (to the left) to quickly disappear in the black.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My conclusions: What I saw had nothing to do with the characteristics of any balloons, nor fireworks, nor any earthly manmade airplanes, nor a manmade satellite, nor falling stars or comet, nothing that we know made today on Earth can move as fast and silently in the sky from a still position. It was definitely something not Terrestrial.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Me: I believe in non-human extraterrestrial intelligence existence. I have been a photographer for many years but did not even try to get my camera so not to take my eyes off of what I was seeing, and it lasted only seconds anyhow. I have always wanted to see a “UFO”, a real one myself, not in pictures. I was not scarred, I was not surprised, I would say I was momentarily perplexed. I just looked up, saw what I saw, and enjoyed it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> And: To my curiosity I googled the date of my ufo sitting and was pleased to see that someone from the beach in Saquarema photographed a strange dot in the sunset sky over the ocean the day before. It was good to know someone else also saw something unusual in the area skies the previous day.<n>

It was a very large Ball of Fire.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first I thought it was just a firework due to the fact it was bonfire night, maybe a rocket type but it was moving slowly towards us.  I could see that it was not an aeroplane or a Helicopter because of the speed it was moving.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It started in the sky about 2 miles away and within seconds it hovered across our garden approximately 500-600 metres up in the sky, as it passed over head I could see it.  A large clear Orb with a Ball of Fire inside once it got 200 metres away it suddenly shot upwards very quickly and disappeared out of sight within seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I knew this was not normal and told family who of course took the Mickey out of me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have never seen anything like this before and am certainly not the type of person who would normally tell people about this or fill in this form but today is the 10th April 2010 and I and my Wife have just seen exactly the same thing again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My wife did not believe me when I told her in November but she was just with me smoking a cigarette on our balcony in South Ockendon, Essex and she witnessed it with me.  Again it was a large Giant Ball of Fire in the sky approximately a mile away from us and I would say about 500 metres up into the sky.  It was so clear that you could see it was fire and it was hovering slowly from right to left of our view.  It was far too slow to be a plane and had no noise to it.  My wife could not believe what she was seeing and I told her it was what I saw before.  We watched it for maybe 30 seconds and the Orb changed route and shot extremely quick straight up into the sky and out of sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am both amazed and confused to what I have seen and still not quite sure how to explain it.<n>

Each object seemed to float slowly downward, and each light faded, and then re-illuminated - each one repeated this numerous times.  At first we thought this was an airplane which potentially caught fire, however, we ruled this out because there was no smoke, and the new objects were lights, not fireballs. Plus, each object faded, and then re-illuminated several times.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It blended with the background color of the night sky, which was clear, but pretty dark that night.  It didn&#39;t just happen to be the right color, it BLENDED. I live here by Eglin AFB and Hurlburt Field.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Evening of 11-5-09, I was outside smoking again, talking to my brother, and another triangle, a bit lighter in color this time (as the background sky was lighter,) flew right over me from due north to due south, between 300-400 feet AGL.  Width was an estimated 25-30 feet wide, and again, the bottom of the craft seemed to blend with the background with uncanny similarity.  It&#39;s like watching a triangle shaped  &#34;Schwartzneggar Predator&#34; pass overhead.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This one was a bit different from the other (which had no lights, no noise, and a bit darker to match the night overhead) as once it went overhead and I was looking at the rear, this time there were two very, very, very faint circular glows on the rear.<n> <n><n> <n><n> If you&#39;ve ever seen kid&#39;s phosphorescent stick-ons to where they&#39;re just about completely faded out in the dark - that&#39;s about the same color, type of glow, and lack of intensity.  Glowed just enough to barely make out.  Again, absolutely zero noise.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This one blended with the sky once past overhead really quickly, unlike conventional aircraft that you can watch for many seconds as it drops toward the horizon.  This &#34;camoflage&#34; really works well.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;m 59 years old, and except seeing two F-4&#39;s on full afterburner chasing a brilliantly shiny no-wing thing very low and over this same town in about 1966, these two events are the only things I&#39;ve seen my entire life.  Two triangles, a tad different, traversing the same area, and both were in the &#34;winter&#34; when the skies were very cool and clear.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Last year&#39;s triangle track would have carried it over the northern portion of the runway at Hurlburt Field.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This one was going due south, only a couple miles of the Gulf of Mexico.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Damnedest things I&#39;ve ever seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Gentlemen, we (somebody) has some very fine top technology aircraft that don&#39;t use jet engines, entirely soundless, blend with the backgoune night sky, and if they don&#39;t cross your field of vision, you won&#39;t see or hear them.<n>

The light was nearing daytime brightness as one of my friends spotted a bright light in the northeast sky falling downward towards the earth at what seemed like tremendous velocity. My first thought was that a massive commit was about to impact the earth, mostly because of the massive wispy trail it left in it’s wake. Then as it neared the earth’s surface it turned upward, this is when we noticed that there were multiple trails that that flowed from the rear of the craft. I no longer believe it was a commit we saw. Another peculiar feature of the trails were that, they did not seem to linger in the sky like any conventional aircraft, but seemed like semi-transparent kite tr! ails swaying non-uniformly  behind whatever we were seeing. As the light floated effortlessly upward it became harder and harder to see through the fog. By the time the sun rose over the hills the light had virtually disappeared. This entire event took place over the span of about 5 minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It also flew at very low altitude also at very low speed.  The object has bright blue light and also has a white flashing light running in one direction on the body of the craft.  Comparing to the side of the normal aircraft, it was much much bigger. The craft has a disc shape and only one object was seen in the sky.  I was on the street and the yellow light shined on me.  The background of the craft was dark as the object was witness flying over the area of Palisade Park to Sycaucus area in New Jersey.<n>

I noticed several bright flashing lights in the sky to directly ahead of me to the East in the sky.  There were a few clouds in the sky, very high in the atmosphere, thin but dark.  The moon was to the East as well mostly covered by the clouds.  The sky for the most part was clear however.  These bright randomly flashing lights seemed to be generally in front of the moon, in the clouds and in the clear sky as well.  Within a fairly small area of the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first I thought they were several planes, but I looked closer and they never blinked twice in the same area or in any pattern that a plane would fly.  It seemed like a small electrical storm, random like lightning, but there was no streaks of light, just flashing dots of light. Not only in the! clouds but in the clear sky as well. Much brighter than any star. I was quite baffled as to what it could possibly be.  As they randomly flickered for maybe two minutes they quickly moved South and out of sight.  Faster than anything that I have seen move across the sky. Well almost like a falling star without a tail, but multiple flashing lights. I found myself so entranced by the lights that I drifted lanes on the highway.  There is no chance that it was a satellite, or any airplane (not even the fastest conceivable), or a falling star, or an electrical storm, to high in the sky to be anything man made.  I am not the sort of person that really thinks that the earth gets visitors for outer-space, but I cannot logically explain what caused the lights in the sky that I witnessed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Yes I was by myself and no I was not on any mood or mind altering substance.  I would like an explanation.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thank you for your time.<n>

As we got closer we noticed it looked like it was flying pretty low, sort of hovering over a section of trees for a few seconds.  We drove past it with it on the passenger side of the car and it started to fly away towards the downtown area, almost like it noticed that we saw it.  It looked like a solid triangle with three steady white lights on the bottom, one on each corner positioned to shine down. It also had red and white lights on the top that were blinking at different times and creating a glow around the top.  It didn’t seem like it was very big, maybe twenty feet wide at the most.  We tried to turn around and follow it but it was gone pretty quickly.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

One object Sighted from Sunol Grade at 6:00pm off 680 heading North hovering in place.  Blueish hue in the middle of object.  Two red lights on what appeared to be the end of the object as it seemed to be horizontal in shape, these would blink on and off in strange intervals, top to bottom, they would also switch sides in a slow and odd fashion.  One red light on Top of and white lights on bottom, green lights that blink turn on every once in a while.  At bottom of grade at Livermore Exit Object appeared to hover in place as planes flew within close proximity of object.  Object seemed to transform shape or move lights and could be seen clearly at this point.  Lost Object eventually behind eastern hills as I continued North on 680 until Bernal Exit.  Sighted in the southern sky at this point still alternating lights and hovering slowly gliding east.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Chased object easterly through Pleasanton until an end road off Vineyard Ave.  Stopped car at dead end and exited car.  Watched object for another five or six minutes as it still hovered about 400-500 feet from where I stood.  No engine or propeller noises were heard object seemed very quiet, you could only faintly hear the traffic off Stanley Blvd.  Object came close to horizon floating toward Stanley Boulevard. Could not get pictures or video with my phone camera, which is all I had with me at the time since I was on my way home from work. Object seemed invisible to the phones camera CCD. Object seemed to avoid horizon as I could almost make out the shape, but it glided north over Stanley Boulevard toward the Rock quarries and disappeared out of site.  Time was 6:45pm at this point...Object never seen again.<n>

This thing had too many lights on it to be regular running lights for a plane or helicopter<n>

PD))<n> <n><n> <n><n> The first sighting happen in grand rapids and appeared as 5 bright orange dots, they were moving as one object but it was to dark to see any structure, they were very close to the ground floating right above a really tall building about 100 feet, the size of the object was huge the lights  spread about 150-200 ft apart. we went back to see these lights about 15 minutes later and they were gone.on nov. 7 i sat on my porch and looked into the night sky over my lake(bostwick lake) wondering what was out there cause i seen those strange lights about a week before, when all of a sudden i notice this bright flashing light in the sky, it was very big, at first i just thought it was a plane then i noticed the lights were in a straight line, there was light all different colors( green orange and red) they would flash one after another in a straight line but very fast, soon i notice another one moving into my view over the lake, it passed the other light very  fast and was very very close to the other one. the lights where very strange when they would move they would kind of flicker to another position around where it was but the strangest part was that it would flicker and end up behind it its original path,i noticed more and more light as i watched the sky, dont have an exact number but there were at least 15 separate moving objects in the sky over the lake, there was another light that flashed very rapidly it almost looked electric but there was only one and it was very different than the other lights,i also seen planes flying right next to and around all of these lights. after watching this for about an hour i see 3 lights emerging from the darkness in the sky they were very bright and orange, there was three of them and they made the shape of a triangle, the triangle was massive again you could almost see a structure but it just look a different shade of black between the lights, as i watched it i noticed the light moving away from! each other,but i as i watched i noticed the object was only c! oming cl oser it stayed in one position  not moving for about an hour, i went inside for about 15 minutes and went back out and it was gone, as i was watching some of these light i seen shooting stars or what looked like them pass right by the lights and that happen about 3 times in 5 minutes, another light i was watching was moving at a very fast speed and i seen what looked like a red shooting star shoot straight downward but it was very close, u could see the flames on it.i seen many objects and i have to say it almost traumatized me, iv never seen anything like it and there were so many. i have seen these lights every night since, they do not come around during the day only night around 6 or 7 until morning, just last night i watched a light which was the exact same 3 lights in a line  flashing object and it was very low to the ground, maybe only 100 foot or less it was a little in the distance but enough to see a structure,it was almost circular shape but with a tail that hung d! own behind it. the object moved back and forth from left to right and about a 100 foot area all night. any person watching bostwick lake skies will see these objects they light up the sky with the amount of them, it is  very strange and they are not planes i can promise you i have a video of  one of the lights also.<n>

I was sitting in the window seat of the aircraft, as I enjoy air-travel and watching our take-off&#39;s.  Heathrow airport was busy at the time, and I was watching many other planes around us out of the window.  We had reached about 1000 feet when I saw a dot about 500 feet below us, at a perpendicular angle towards the plane.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I followed the object, looking intently, expecting to be able to identify the aircraft as it approached closer.  As it approached I was very surprised to see that it did not materialize into any sort of aviation related object.  It was a perfectly spherical shape, a light yet dull metallic gray in colour, with no visible markings or imperfections in the purely circular shape.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It caught my attention, and I struggled to figure out what it was.  I assumed it must have been a stationary object on the ground until it passed approximately 500 feet below the ! plane at a relatively high velocity.<n> <n><n> <n><n> From my guess it was relatively small object, no more than 5 metres in diameter.  I was completely and utterly puzzled, having never seen anything like it.  I have excellent 20/20 vision, and it was a perfect day visually, no clouds/precipitation or fog, and the sun was not too bright.  I was quite alert at the time, and was not tired.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I made out the object very clearly, and could easily define the spherical shape and dull metallic colour, it was not blurry in any way and definitely was not a speck or smudge on the aircraft window.  That bizarre sighting has puzzled me ever since.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date is approximate.  PD))<n>

There was a tree line, so it was hard to keep a constant eye on them.  They appears like 5 lights that were slanted like hash marks right next to each other.  They moved very grauatedly and looked like they were blending together into one light and then separated some but only into 3 lights when it did. The light was a white color. There were no stars out, just the moon.  It was hard to tell for sure it the lights were blending together as we were driving and I wasn’t sure if it was just because our vantage point was changing or the lights were changing.  I asked my passenger if she saw the lights when I first did and she did and we both watched them as they eventually disappeared altogether. We spoke about it and both thought it wasn&#39;t falling stars as they were there for a longer than a flash and they moved really slow like they were in water or s! omething. They didn’t fall any and they stayed just as bright as when we first saw them until they were gone in a blink.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report corrected date to November 03, 2009.

I think it might have been some kind of rocket, and am primarily looking for ways to check and see if any known launchings were taking place on November 6, 2009, at about 6:50 pm CST near Oklahoma City.  I don&#39;t know how to look for that kind of information, since searches online aren&#39;t bearing much fruit.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was driving home with my boyfriend, and for about seven minutes, we drove towards a little pink dot near the sunset.  From far away, I asked my boyfriend what he thought it was, and he guessed maybe Venus.  However, as we got closer, the object got significantly larger.  We only traveled about two miles, so I don&amp;#8217;t think this thing would have been particularly high in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When we saw it at its closest, it appeared to be two white streams being emitted from a single tiny black dot situated above the streams.  That dot flickered orange frequently.  I&amp;#8217;d pass it off as a jet using its booster from Tinker Air Force Base, but this object did not appear to move.  My boyfriend said it looked like it might be moving slowly upwards, which would make sense if the streams were coming from thrusters.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Unfortunately, I had to turn the car at that point, and we couldn&amp;#8217;t see it anymore.  It had gone from near the horizon to almost directly overhead as it got larger, and once we turned, it was obscured by the car roof.  I rushed home, which probably took about five minutes, grabbed my camera, and ran back out...  But we couldn&amp;#8217;t find it again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I saw an airplane flying on the horizon near it, when it was still too small to distinguish the streams.  The plane was much smaller than the shape, even then, and looked farther away.  I could also see the plane moving, while I could not observe the object moving.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It seemed terrestrial to me, maybe a rocket taking up a satellite or something.  I just don&amp;#8217;t know where would be close enough to launch something like that, for it to be close enough to visually change so significantly in size after driving only a couple of miles.  If there is anywhere I can check records of what&amp;#8217;s been launched when and where, I&amp;#8217;d really like to check out whatever it was that I saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Location information:  When we lost whatever it was, we were facing West and turning South on N 122nd and Memorial in Oklahoma City.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Image information:  I couldn&#39;t get a picture, but I did a couple of quick illustrations.  The first shows the shape from far away, when we first saw it, and the airplane behind it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The second shows how it looked when we saw it at its closest.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I don&#39;t see where to attach them to this, but I will email them to the address provided.<n>

The colors were red, bright white, bright sapphire bright blue, orange with a tinge of green and a tinge of pink. This is the closest as I can describe the colors because they all were more brilliant and bolder than any color I had ever seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It slowly moved east of our location hovered, and moved a bit south... then would hover again.  As of now it is slowly moving away.. it is so dark that none of our cameras will pick up any pictures, the camera will not let us take a picture. We changed to a digital camera, but it just came out a blank black sky, because the object had moved further away at this point.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We can still see it in the distance.  It was by far the most spectacular thing we have ever seen.  We are avid sky watchers and always look at stars, planets and the sky.  You could see that the lights had motion most definitely I have seen twinkling stars before and this was nothing of the sort.<n>

I continued on my way home in the direction it was flying and came to a big field near my house. there i saw the craft again hovering in place above the field. I had now turned off the 3 lights and turned on a large green light which was mounted on the back. after hovering in the same place for seconds it flew away at a very high speed. after that i just went home. Later i called my parents who werent home and told them of what had happened. as i was standing on my porch gazing at a star an orange orb appeared in the sky. it began to fly towards my house. my brother immediatly got the camera and i began taking pictures. as it flew overhead it was silent and you c! ould clearly tell it was a triangle shape. soon after black suv&#39;s began driving past my house, and i ran inside and called the police.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The light covered the whole area possibly 50 kilometer radius.  The light exceeded the full moon as well as flourescent lighting that is installed in the village.  The light flashed for about 6 seconds and disappeared .<n> <n><n> <n><n> We looked all around us but could not see anything  after some few seconds we suddenly saw a flash and ball of fire coming from the sky like a comet star coming down but the ball of fire was going at lighting speed towards the western direction.  The flash and ball of fire disappeared and after some few seconds we heard deafening sound like a minor earth tremor happening. and that was it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My earlier suspicion was that its a big aeroplace coming down but then an aeroplane would have not made such light and huge noise!   The object left a trail of orange fire on its back before it disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The reporter is a Financial Accountant<n>
11/2/09 20:30|Coos Bay|OR|Circle|30-45 seconds|Glowing green light near street intersection spotted, then shoots straight up.|4/13/10|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/074/S74444.html|307|ndxe200911| Glowing green light near street intersection spotted, then shoots straight up.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I’ve had weird, unexplained things happen to me over the years but on 11-02-2010 it was visually strange.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was a clear night and I had just left Fred Meyers store at about 8:30 pm  As I was driving up Central Ave. toward Ocean Blvd.  I thought I saw at the top of Central and Ocean a green light over the flashing yellow light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My first thought was oh no they didn’t put a stop light up here!  But as I got closer I realized that the light (the same color as a green traffic light) was bigger and higher up then the flashing yellow light.  It looked like it it was behind the Methodist church where there are big power lines.  It wasn’t like a regular green light because the light glowed and moved around, like millions of fireflies.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Now my curiosity as to what I was looking at kept me driving toward it.  Just as I realized what  I thought it was there was a flash and it shot straight up in the sky leaving a yellow trail of something that had been shot! out of it.  I was so shocked at what I saw!  You hear about them but you never plan on seeing one.  Total time from seeing it to it vanishing was about 30 to 45 sec. I went home as scheduled and told my children who believed my story.  I didn’t give it much thought after that.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A week later on 11-07-2010 I had just gotten out of my car from work and  again it was around 8:30 pm when for some reason I looked up over my apartment.  It was again a clear night and I saw a white star move.  I continued to look at this ‘star’ which as high as it was I figured it was over Empire Lakes which is behind my apartment building complex.  As I continued to watch the star it started to glow bright and get larger.  Then it shot off north leaving again a yellowish trail behind it shooting south.  I was shocked but not surprised.  This also took about 30 to 45 secs.  Again I went in and told the kids that I just saw another one.  Again they believed me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The only thing that really makes all of this weird is that two days later I woke up at 10:00 am.  Everyone in the apartment, including the cats were still asleep.  I found this odd as my 9 year old granddaughter who slept with me at the time is usually up at the crack of dawn.  My cat Yuki cries at the door at 9:00 am every morning like clockwork to be fed.  I was the only person awake.  Gradually, everyone was up and about and seemed sluggish.  I discovered that I didn’t feel well, had a headache and my throat and windpipe were extremely dry, like bone dry.  My lymph nodes in my throat were swelled up to bursting and I had three horizontal cuts on the bottom right side of my mouth.  I felt like this for about five days.  I didn’t get checked out by a doctor as I didn’t have any health insurance at the time.  I do have an appointment in March and I will ask the doctor to check out the marks in my mouth.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Previously in 2003 to 2004 I had lived off Seven Devils Road in a secluded spot on the ocean on Tokyo Lane.  I didn’t write down exact times of the things that happen to me while the kids and I lived there.  I was constantly plagued by the Coast Guard helicopter flying directly and very close to my house at 2 or 3:00 in the morning several times a month.  When I say close I mean just over my roof top!  I thought that they may  be rescuing someone but there were never any reports of vessels needing assistance and they weren‘t near the water.  One time I woke up to what I thought was a spot light over the house and thinking the Coast Guard was at it again.  I got up out of bed to flip them off.  Just as my feet hit the floor I heard the Coast Guard coming?  The light went out and I got back into bed to hear the Coast Guard once again fly as fast as they can from the station, south toward Bandon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I woke up one time with every joint  in my body on fire.  When I say joint I  mean every place that a bone connects to another bone.  This lasted  for about 20 min. and then the pain faded away.  It was an uncomfortable feeling living there and night time was always stressful.  I was fatigued all the time, the children said they felt like they were being watched.  We left in 02-2004 and the children and I were grateful to leave and move back into town.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Apparently, it doesn’t matter where you live.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have shared this with very few people.  My friend in California believes my stories and is greatly concerned.  Hopefully, this will help and in some way be another piece of the puzzle.<n>

I am a full-time student and the other witness, my father, is employed full-time. I have not inquired further into any UFO experiences he has had but nothing has ever been mentioned. He is a very logical thinker and it is a crucial part of his profession. He cannot explain what we witnessed but does not hold any beliefs of it being extra-terrestrial.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was approximately 8:00 PM here in Bainbridge Island, WA when the incident occurred. A more specific date and time can be traced if you were to examine what was on television at the moment, which was a Los Angeles Lakers game being broadcast on TNT. A rainy night that me and my father spent watching the game, in a room with large windows taking up the majority of the wall. The view leads into a landscaped garden which extends into a wooded area. Past this area that extends a few hundred feet is another backyard that is not visible due to large trees.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A timeout occurred in the game and my father took the opportunity to get a drink from the kitchen. As he stood up and started to exit the room, an intense bright light flashed to fill the entire room. The light came from directly in front of me and appeared to me to have come from somewhere within the landscaped area. The flash was described by both me and my father as similar to a camera flash, and that is what he thought it was at first. I suggested lightening but we both concluded it wasn’t that due to the lack of thunder and way it shined. It had shined into the room as if it was a flashlight, and by the time we had decided what it wasn’t, the TV switched from the game to a test emergency broadcast. It stumbled between that and static till it settled on an address being given by President Obama. Me and my father were confused and both had a strange feeling when a minute later an unmarked black helicopter flew over head with it’s searchlight on. A few minutes later it sw! itched back to the game on TNT with no explanation of the emergency broadcast test. Things continued as normal after that.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date is approximate.  PD))<n>

One changed shape and both disappeared<n> <n><n> <n><n> Approximately 9am 11/2/2009 I received a call from two of my workers on a job site claiming they saw two UFO&#39;s. They asked if I could see them from where I was. Not able to locate the UFO&#39;s I drove about 10 minutes to their location where I saw my two workers and about a dozen residents of the location on the 2nd floor of a high rise condo looking up. They described two objects, one bright red the other white, neither one blinking. One sitting still white the other circling. I always carry binoculars with me and was able to locate the two objects they described.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The two objects were directly overhead, very high in the sky but their exact height was difficult to determine as there were no clouds, blue sky and no other aircraft in the area to allow proportion.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My first thought was that the objects were lost helium balloons but it was unusual that one was motionless and and stationary while the red object seemed to drift away from the white object. After several minutes the red object drifted back toward the white object, follow a semi circle around the white object, drift away then disappear.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Convinced these were balloons I left the jobsite, residents still looking skyward, drove about a mile, stopped my truck, called my wife who was about 5 miles from my location to see if she could see the remaining object. Not having a clue as to how large an object this was or how high I figured if she could see it that far away then a) we weren&#39;t imagining anything or b) the object obviously had some size to it. After telling her where to look she spotted it also.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We both watched for about 15 seconds, her naked eyes and me though my binoculars when the object started getting very bright, change from a spherical shape to a more elongated cigar type shape, get very fuzzy or almost mirage-like then disappear.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My wife described exactly what I was viewing through the binoculars. My workers radioed the same exact description. The object,which appeared to be white then silverish blinked, got very bright, dimmed, became elongated then fuzzy then disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I tried to use my camera phone to record it but the objects were too high to get any type of accurate recorded visual. Also tried to place the lens of the camera phone up to the binocular eyepiece, which sometimes works but the objects were too difficult to locate.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The entire sighting was about 20 minutes.<n>

The &#39;star&#39; looked to be hovering still over the next mountain range.  At first I thought that is way too bright for a star, so I considered it might be a plane.  I looked closely for appx 30 seconds and the light did not move at all and their were no other lights associated with it to indicate it was a plane.  At that point the light disappeared completely.  If it were a plane, not only would I have saw at least some movement, but I would have saw the tail lights or other lights when it would have turned.  Their is no other way to discribe what I seen, other than a UFO.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

We stopped to watch, was west of Gandy and Himes.  I&#39;ve lived here for over 30 years and haven&#39;t seen anything like it. It was moving sporadically, not like a plane.  It moved around for about 5 minutes then disappeared.<n>

It hovered completely stationary and silent for 1 second. It then zipped forward (with instant velocity) in a straight line parallel to the road for 2 seconds and then disappeared from sight while still remaining completely silent.  The relative size of the object was about that of the moon.  It did not change altitude or disappear behind any of the surroundings (oil pumps, houses, wind turbines, etc.).<n>

I really don&#39;t believe much in these UFO&#39;s or aliens. But today i was very much astonished with this event. Today i was leaving to office (Am working @ night shifts) then suddenly i heard an aircraft flying. Just as normally i watched the sky but i saw a rather amazing sight. A triangle shaped or might be something else was moving across the sky. Then i thought might be the cloud was moving past. But i watched it for next few seconds the one was followed by almost 30-40 similar things &amp; they formed some kind of a Random formation.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They moved very fast but they were like a swarm &amp; moved along swiftly. Soon they went past my eye sight. I went to the terrace &amp; some of my friends saw it too.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Now i have no choice left to believe in these things &amp; &#34;We are not alone&#34;<n>

I jogged and walked the track until about 7:45 PM. I decided to lay down and stretch before going home.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was a cool and clear night and cool night with a bright full moon. I laid down on my back to stretch and was looking up at the sky noticing how clear and pretty it was.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I noticed 3 stars in a triangle pattern that stood out from the rest, nothing seemed unusual about that. But as I was just gazing up at them  I noticed 1 of the stars or what appeared to be a star start moving to the right.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It started moving very slowly, so slow in fact I thought my eye’s were not focusing well or it was just me. But I then noticed the bright star to the right of the object (a planet more than likely because it was so bright) was staying stationary. NO other stars were moving.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object moved very slowly, I then started looking for blinking lights thinking maybe it was a plane coming in at an angle and then turning or something. But as it moved very slowly to the right it slowly started to fade out. And it then disappeared. I viewed it for at least 45 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I thought of everything it could be because I am a skeptic.  At first I thought maybe it was the space station, but I ruled that out because I have seen the space station before and you can see it from start to finish and it moves much faster than this object was moving.  We have a Navy base that trains pilots in single engine prop planes and I seen three right after this sighting and they all had blinking lights and even at the slow speed they travel they still traveled faster than this object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I ruled out everything, even space junk. Because when I started looking up all 3 stars were not moving. Then one of them started to move very slowly to the right and flickered as it faded out.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It just vanished in the night sky. I heard no noise, because when it flickered out I thought it might be an after burner on a jet. I have not other explanation other than it was a UFO.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Note: I live in the city where the lights are bright and you can’t see most of the stars. But this object was as bright as the Planet to the right of it. If someone was not paying attention they would have not noticed this object moving because it was moving so slow.<n>

On the way home from T.K.D. lessons, we had stopped in a traffic jam next to a high school football field. I peered out the window to get a better look at the traffic, and in the sky I saw 4 lights in a triangular formation; 3 white lights in each corner of the triangle and a single red light in the center.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was dark, and all I could tell from the lights were that they did not flash or blink in any way. I know that there were some power lines around, but if there was a solid object behind those lights, it was enormous. I&#39;m sure others saw it, but I can&#39;t be sure. The craft did move, at a speed I estimate to be about 5 mph. I know that this was not the illusion created from the moving car, as I saw it move even when we were stopped. I didn&#39;t bother to tell my mom and sister, as they would just think I was joking.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;ve heard of the theorized TR-3B &#34;Government UFO,&#34; and I think that what I saw might bear a resemblance to the infamous Black Triangle.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The lights were still there, even after the traffic started to pick up again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The next day, we took the same route to and from Tae Kwon Do lessons. On the way to our lesson, I looked at the spot in the sky where I had spotted the 3 lights. There was nothing like a cellphone, VOR or radio tower in the vicinity.

Pleasant and Charleston County, SC.  Well yesterday, 11-1-09, I was driving home to North Charleston from one of our stores loacted in Mt. Pleasant.  I always take the 526 home to North Charleston.  It was just before sunset yesterday and as I was driving I saw the strangest thing in the sky.  It looked like a black rectangular object that wasn&#39;t moving, way up in the sky against the clouds.  I thought &#34;what the heck is that?&#34; and had to keep driving but I did slow down some.  There is no safe place to pull off the road once on the 526.  Well I kept watching it and watching it as I drove.  I believe I saw another craft of some sort up way, way above it and to the right of it and this smaller, harder to see craft may have been plane shaped.  I began to think things.  I thought that maybe there was a helicopter or plane towing something.<n> <n><n> <n><n> But I really didn&#39;t see a tow chain or rope of any kind between the two, but that&#39;s what it looked like.  Now my immagination went wild and I want to say it reminded me of the Star Trek Enterprise pulling the borg cube with a tractor beam! Seriously, I thought well there must be a logical explanation.  I thought the airforce might have been doing some scientific experiment and may have dropped or pulled something from behind a plane or helicopter as a weather/wind experiment or something like that.  I thought well maybe one of those planes that pull an advertisement sign behind it like those I see off the beach when I go to Daytona.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I just don&#39;t know anything.  Now I want to believe that it was a spaceship from outerspace with extraterrestrials on it.  I really, really do!  All I really know for sure however is that I saw something in the sky that didn&#39;t seem to be moving at first, like a black, rectangular window against the white clouds way high up that day.  Then I saw the other thing, the maybe plane shaped craft.  Now the black object either turned and narrowed, or as I drove foreward I saw from a different angle and it narrowed.  I believe they started to slowly move and eventually I lost sight of them because I entered into my own neighborhood and trees blocked any further view of them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As soon as I got home yesterday I wrote to MUFON and a representative from MUFON called me last night.  Today I told my boss about the incident and I even tried to contact the Charleston Airforce base to ask if they had anything unusual or unexplained on their radar over North Charleston yesterday, but I cou! ldn&#39;t find an e-mail addy that would do any good.  I watched and looked at the thing for a good fifteen minutes on my way home on this 526.  There were plenty of other cars on the road and I&#39;m surprised nobody else noticed, if they did, they didn&#39;t post a report about it.  Well I&#39;m a definate believer.  I&#39;m convinced!  I am not a skeptic.  I believe in UFOs and in extraterrestrial life.  I&#39;ve seen too much not to be a believer.  I sure intend to keep on watching the sky!<n>

It looked like a plane at first; I thought it was just coming in to the airport, but then I noticed it wasn&#39;t moving and also it was flashing green, blue, red &amp; white lights off and on, but in no particular pattern. I ran back inside and yelled for my friend Mary to come out and take a look and I grabbed a small pair of binoculars on the way back outside.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I looked up and it was no longer a &#34;strip&#34; of flashing lights, but was now an oval shape with the same colored lights on and around it. They seemed to be twinkling instead of flashing now. I handed the binoculars to Mary and asked what she seen.( I didn&#39;t want her to be influenced by what I described, and also wanted to see if she could see anything at all.) She described the exact things I was seeing. It continued to hover there and I called several friends to get some one else to acknowledge this &#34;object&#34;, but no one answered.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We then drove down to our local Shell gas station/convenience store to get the cashier to verify the sighting of this object. She hadn&#39;t used binoculars before and could not really get a good look at it; she did state that her son had seen a UFO a couple days earlier, though.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I called the local Police and the cashier called the Highway Patrol to see if anyone else had reported anything and they both said &#34;no&#34;.It was not in the sky when we got home and we did not see it leave, fly or disappear; We called this number provided by the Redding Police Dept. and the recording gave us this web site address.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The entire incident lasted approx. 40 minutes I am including sketches of what we saw, with descriptions and will email it ASAP.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
