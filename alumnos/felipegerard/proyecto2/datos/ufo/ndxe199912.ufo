Oh boy was my heart racing i was in complete denial , i thought ah bugger it i didnt see it.so by this time i was in party mode and then bang boom blast,happy new year, the fire works had started it was awsome but i still had this niggling feeling that wouldnt go away it was that so called shooting star i saw and i dont know why but i had paid no attention to the fire works any more and looked behind me away from the fire works over my shoulder straight up in to the semi blacsk clouded sky and there it re apeard.It came right out of the cloud staight down, sat there for 2 seconds and ZOOM staight back up again.I could not believe what i had just saw, this time i was convinced it was a ufo and i will never forget that night ever for as long as i live.I know exactly what they were doing, they wanted to see the biggest fire works display ever just like we all did and being the year 2000 i believe they where celebrating mankinds efforts for making it this far or even giving each other a pat on the back for what they have created US the human race...<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We trust that the witness means the date of December 31, 1999.

Thank You.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was New Years Eve 1999. My sister and her husband were lighting firecrackers outside.  this was nearing 12;00 a.m. My sister came to my door to say&#34;you have to see this&#34; I went outside not knowing what to expect and what I saw was a beautiful Amber colored light.  It was a very sweet, deep color and it looked like a star, except that it was moving,not datring across the sky l;ike a shooting star.  This  &#34;star&#34;  had a very deliberate motion.  It move continuously west to east,but not always in a astraight line.  It would periodically &#34;bob&#34; up and down.  This caught my attention immediately because I know of no plane that could manage these manuevers.  Eventually it disappeared into the clouds.<n>

I observed this for five seconds , making sure it was not any fireworks fired too early, navigational lights of light aircraft in the area at the time , or any thing natural that could produce such an effect. Once I knew what I was looking at I called the attention of my five friends , two-fifty year olds , and three twenty year olds . As they looked directly above they also saw exactly what I was seeing for two more rotations that lasted for three second. Then the two obects broke formation and travelled in opposite directions , the object on the left slowed down coming to a stand still staying the same size and brightness. But the object on the right appeared to accend in alttitude reducing in size and brightness to a star of magnitude 5 , then pairing up with a third object of identical size and brightness . These two objects then performed the same manuver of rotating clockwise for about five seconds then broke formation in opposite directions to slowly come to a halt in what I would call a slighly off center triangle . The first object forming the peak and the two smaller objects forming the base. they made their stationary positions about a hand spand below the constellation of orion .We were all stunned and excited at the same time , as it appears we must have been the only people on that block in the street to have seen anything , hard to believe a city of 100.000 people and not one comment in the next days news or papers. I stayed outside on the ground watching the statinary points of light for one and a half hours before realising that they had positioned themselves into existing star positions and I had no way of knowing if they were still holding position or if they had allready accended to an even higher alttitude and departed.<n>

They went aprox.10 miles and then stoped. and just stood there. As it got closer to midnight everyone said come on its almost time. I turn away for a min and then looked back as they went out of sight. It was breath taking only one other time in my life time have I ever seen a ufo and that was when I was living in Pocatello Idaho 27 years ago on a still night. I know someone else had to of seen it as it went over the freeway that night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Unless our webmaster can figure out how to transfer the formation from e-mail format to our database, and then to the website, the witness&#39;s original design may not be able to be preserved here.))<n>

I lost sight heading easterly and regained it heading south on Carlton Hills Blvd. near Stumps Market due to overcast skies. Anyone else?<n> <n><n> <n><n> Orange lights, moving towards and away from each other. Friends had seen &#34;sprinkling things&#34; coming from it/ them. Also, one light had moved dimly toward another brighter light and then became brighter. L-shaped formation. Indiscernible shapes.<n>

I was marvelling at how clear the skies were, and noticed what I thought were airplanes stacked-up to land at O&#39;Hare airport (about 80 miles away). I asked my friends to come out and see this, but of course no one budged. I didn&#39;t think anything more of it until the next day when CNN reported that most major airports across the US ceased operations by about 9:30pm because of Y2K concerns. O&#39;Hare was one of the airports mentioned by name. The next day, I started hearing reports of lights in the sky over Rockford. What I observed were three lights with a glowing amber/orange color that seemed to hover in a triangular formation.<n>

Had no sound or blinking lights<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I arrived home from work I went inside to greet my family on December 31, 1999 NewYears Eve.  About 10 minutes later, my husband and I went outside onto our front porch after hearing some noisy people outside. To our astonishment, we had looked up into the sky and noticed a strange round object soaring through the sky going towards the NorthEast direction.  Strangely enough the object had no blinking lights like that of any type of airplane or hellicopter and no sound whatsoever.  My husband and I were speechless after putting together all of the facts known to us to conclude that this was very abnormal. I was so concerned I had to phone my mother and tell her the news and ask her if there was suppose to be any aircraft at all whatsoever that night.  Another odd aspect of our sighting, is that the object was going at a high rate of speed, slow down, and speed up again.  That night after a long night of hardly any sleep because of our strange and unusual feeling that this ! was just not right, my mother called me the very next morning to report to me that there was an article in the local newspaper that I was not the only one to have witnessed such a strange occurance.  One lady who was driving in the area was so astonished, she pulled over to dial 911.  This has certainly been the talk around town in the newspapers and radio shows but, nothing is known to what a large number of people with the same story has seen the night before the new year.  The National Weather Service concluded to knowing that there was no odd weather patterns in the sky.  The Greater Rockford Airport concluded that all air traffic was grounded that evening and nothing on radar.  The well respected policeman and firemen in this area who had seen this object concluded that it was something unother than they&#39;ve ever seen before.  So my BIG question is WHAT THE HECK IS IT!  I need to know for my personal comfort.  In conclusion I have never seen or have been a witness to anyth! ing of this sort but, I do know that this was scary.<n>

Rockford is near my hometown, so I check this site almost daily.  I am not a witness.  The article is posted on the 1/2/2000 page. The airport is Rockford is pretty busy, passenger jets and many cargo planes.  It looks interesting. What follows is a partial quote from the article. &#34;The unusual sightings were reported Friday night by several spectators at Rockford&#39;s downtown New Year&#39;s Eve celebration. Accounts continued surfacing Saturday from outlying areas as well. Most described reddish-orange lights moving across the sky about 10 or 11 p.m. -- before most fireworks demonstrations began. Veroni, who was celebrating on Main Street north of downtown Rockford, was startled enough to stop at a gas station and dial 9-1-1. She said she feared a Y2K computer foulup had launched missiles at the United States. &#34;It was either missiles, or -- man, I&#39;m telling you -- spaceships,&#34; she said. &#34;It was like nothing I&#39;ve ever seen.&#34; &#34;<n>

Moved slowly, about east to west.  Several observers. several minutes.  Also viewed through binoculars.<n> <n><n> <n><n> While doing some amateur astronomy, I was aiming my telescope at the Orion nebula, while a companion visually observed the object (without the scope) originating from about the same area in the sky.  It moved VERY slowly.  For about the first thirty seconds as it approached, we looked for airplane blinkers, and the object definitley passed &#34;close&#34; enough to see some sort of shape with absolutely no blinkers. Then I tried to get the object sighted in my finder scope but could not (that was for probably another 30 seconds). Then four other observers wandered out into the backyard and they watched, while I ran back inside to fetch my binoculars.  It took about another 45 seconds for me to get back.  I quickly found the object in my binoculars and watched for about another minute or two.  I tried to be conservative in my time estimates -- several other observers think it took much longer on the order of 4-6 minutes.  There was no sound at all.  The object was glowing a fairly bright orange.  It moved entirely in a straight line, with no apparent trail.  It was also fairly large visually, about as large as an airplane looks when passing overhead still in ascent (we are very near Lambert Airport).  The object generally went east to west, at about 45 degrees from us when it passed the closest.  Although I had the binoculars and noted that there was some apparent shape, I could not steady the view enough to determine the shape.  Another observer with keen eyesight described it as a &#34;flattened egg&#34; or oval.  The time of 19:30 CST is a very rough estimate, as none of us thought to check our watches at the time.  It was definitely well before 20:15 CST. The object did not originate anywhere at all near where there is supposed to be some meteor activity.  My first guess would be a sattelite reentry. I am 33 years old, and I am a new amateur astronomer.  I do not believe in extra-terrestrials, but this was a bizarre event nonetheless, confirmed by several observers.  Four of the other observers were in their 30&#39;s &amp; 40&#39;s, both male and female, and there was a 6 yr. old boy who also watched.  As I said, the more I think about it, the more likely it becomes that it was a reentering sattelite in my opinion.  Nobody was &#34;under the influence&#34; -- there was no alcohol at our gathering.<n>

Iwalked to the elavators and waited until one came.  While waiting I looked south east in the sky and saw approximately 12 circular objects about the size of a dime, where I was standing.  They were not moving and were quite high in the sky.  I looked for someone else to tell but could not find anyone.  I then just left into the elevator and went to work inside the office.  I didn&#39;t want to tell anyone else at that point because I felt they would think I was crazy.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The pilot refered to local weather reports and there was no severe weather indicated. One of the biologists was very affraid to look at the disturbance in the air.

They then stopped and the one on the left moved straight up as the one on the right moved straight down.  They changed colour as they did this.  From blue to red and white and then orange again.  They moved up and down vertically for a couple of minutes and then came in line again.  They then shot up into the sky and disappeared.

It was headed south from a northerly direction and its path was diagonal and somewhat angled towards the earth.  I do not believe it was a shooting star, for it was a cloudy night (only two stars were visible in the sky) and the object was about the size of a ping-pong ball or half-dollar.  I feel it was denifitely in our atmosphere and relatively close to the earth. Also, it did not have a trail and did not fade out. It was also almost directly above our heads.<n>

There was no sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We do have a flight path above our island, and therefore realise that this was definitely not a plane.<n> <n><n> We observed it for approximately 15 seconds whilst the light got weaker and orange then red until it disappeared.

Made no sound as it moved at a slow steady rate speed. As it came closer towards being directly over head it looked more like a star  radiating light striations. Then it suddenly blinked out.<n> <n><n> <n><n> While taking an evening walk with my dog, I noticed a large rounded light appraoch low in the sky. I first thought that it was the medivac heliocopter that can be seen on a daily basis but as it got closer no discernible noise could be heard. I walked up the street where the trees would not block my view and I stood still - waiting for it to pass directly over me. I noted, that compared to western horizon and the hills and low mountains in the east that it may have been at 1500 feet or less and was no more than a mile away. The degree of angle may have been 30 to 35. Sky was clear and the moon was brightly waning. It became larger as it appraoched ( size of a penny held at arm&#39;s length). By now it looked more like a slow moving, pinkish star low in the sky-complete with raditing striations. Then before it got over head , it just simply blinked out. Never made a sound. Other identifiable craft could be seen flying at much higher, safer altittudes (silouetted against the sky w/red,green &amp; white strobes on them). But none of them were like this fallen starlike object. in addition I could see a thick dark contrail where the object had been before it winked out.<n>
12/29/99 18:00|Denver|CO||na|strange phenomenon after sighting|9/17/00|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/014/S14001.html|23|ndxe199912| strange phenomenon after sighting<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is a follow up report to my original report of a very close-up ufo sighting in late December of this year. I reported this event here and also worked with a local mufon investigator. Since that event occured I have had a host of very strange phenomenon happen to me.I have been shy talking about these things but after confering with Peter Davenport about this situation occurring to me now, from what I beleive is a result of my interaction with this object back in December. He assured me that this would be valuable follow-up information about this whole phenomenon. About two months after my encounter/sighting all of the moles on my body began to fade then completely disappear, too date five moles have completely disappeared and nine more are in different states of fading. About five months after this event occured all of the hair on my arms and legs began to change to light blonde en mass. I have medium brown hair and am only 29 years old. Although I originally considered premature greying I began to notice the individual hairs changed color from the root upwards and when the hair started to change it took about 5 days for the complete hair change the top of the hair fading from medium brown to reddish to blonde  , so it was not as if it was growing out this color and no amount of sun exposure has ever caused lightening like this on me before,also the hairs that have changed colors have actually changed in consistency they were originally a medium coarseness and now they are feather soft fine. About two months ago my spider veins in my legs began to fade and now one that I have had for about 5 years is completely gone and another is fading rapidly. Since this has occured I have had &#39;dreams&#39;almost nightly of entities who talk to me and claim to be intelligent species from somewhere else and they keep trying to give me strange information I don&#39;t understand. I have woken up a few times and caught myself uttering some language that I have never heard before but I have ruled out speaking in tounges because it seems this  &#39;language&#39; seems to have structure and form. I also throughtout the day have feelings of hot and cold in different parts of my body, I get pulsating feelings on the bottom of my feet up my legs down my arms and on the palms of my hands.Sometimes this pulsating becomes so intense it is painful. I have also felt this heat/pulsating feeling right below my eyes between my eyes and in the front of my brain. I am very upset and confused as to what is going on with me and hope to be working with a paranormal investigator soon.<n>

It had a blue light then a red light then a blue light. That was all I could see of the object as I was appraching it at about 35 mph. I began to wonder what it was because it was so low and seemed to be hovering unmoving. I eventually ruled out plane because of the complete stillness of lights. I ruled out crane or building lights for low flying aircraft because there was nothing above two stories in a 10 block radius. I decided as I got closer it must be a hovering helicopter.I was coming up to the lights now and I could tell they were only about 6 stories high so I was expecting to see a helicopter. As I passed under the object I saw a greyish black boomerang shaped object.My mouth hung open and I said aloud to myself what in the #### is that! I could not stop in my tracks as there were cars behind me. I turned aff at the nest street came to a park postion and jumped out of my car. It was not longer then 30 seconds since I saw the object but it was gone . I jumped in my car after surveying the skyline went up to twelfth went up three blocks and came down thirtenth again.There was nothing above thirtennth or low flying craft anywhere that I could see. I came around again for a second pass and again nothing above thirteenth and nothing anywhere in the sky that I cold see except plane high above (very very high) I then realized something also paculiar about the obect although it had red an blue lights (which made me originally think it was normal air traffic )I realized at the third pass when I saw the other plane high up that the object I saw lights had never blinked once any of them. I had watched it for about 2 minutes coming up to it and not on light ever blinked.<n>

I noticed a very bright light in the sky in front of me. It was approximately 30° above the horizon. (Although, looking in that direction there are hills, so it was probably more in the range of 35-40° above the true horizon). The light was moving fairly quickly from left to right across my field of vision. My first thougtht was it was an airplane with its landing lights on. It was an extremely brilliant light, very white or blue-white. Then it appeared to stop, and I thought perhaps it had been turning slightly towards me and now was facing me so the apparent motion was stopped, although there was only one light rather than the two one normally sees from an approaching plane. But it continued to stay motionless and the light did not appear to grow any closer or brighter. I then thought perhaps it was a helicopter with a bright light on it. But I continued to watch it for several minutes and it made no movement. I also heard no sound (There were no sounds out there in the countryside other than the occasional low “moo” from a nearby cattle pen). After watching for several minutes, I went into the house and called the others to come outside to look at the light. We all trooped out the back door and I pointed out the still stationary light. Witness 2 asked what is was. I said I didn’t know and explained its movements so far. Witness 3 asked if it could be a planet or a star. I said it was certainly much larger and brighter than any star or planet I’d ever seen, that it looks bright like nearby aircraft landing lights, and it also moved from left to right and then stopped. Then I noticed it seemed to move slightly to right, and said so. Witness 2’s boys (Witness 4 and Witness 5) agreed. We all kept watching it while speculating on what it might be. It appeared to move both left and right and up and down occasionally, but with no pattern I discerned. These were precise horizontal and vertical movements We all noticed the same movement. Witness 3 wondered if we were perhaps seeing the movement as some sort of optical illusion. But we were all seeing the same movements. After Witness 3’s speculation, when I noticed movement, I did not call it out, but waited to see if someone else would notice and call out the movement I saw. Both Witness 2 and both boys at least once each called out movements (that I saw but did not state until after they said something). So at all times we were seeing the same movement. I asked the boys what they saw (as they good eyes - no glasses, and we had no binoculars). Witness 4 said he saw a darker area around the light. Witness 5 said to him the dark area looked kind of like a doughnut. I thought perhaps there was a smaller light above the light and asked the boys if they could tell if there was more than one or what it looked like to them. Witness 5 said it looked like there was a light on top going up and down. Witness 4 agreed that it looked like that to him. I thought perhaps I could see that movement, but I couldn’t tell for sure. We continued to watch and talk about the light, until we needed to leave for our hunting trip, which was approximately 5:30 am. Total time viewing the object from first sighting, until we left was at least 20 minutes. The weather was clear and dry, temperature approx. high 30’s It wasn’t possible to tell how far away or how high the object was, although I would venture a guess of a mile or two distant. In size it appeared to be something about the size of a pea held a arms length. At one point while we were watching, I used lights from two houses or farms as reference points. The “light” appeared to be equidistant (left and right) from the ground lights , making it the top point in a triangle. When we went to leave I looked at this again and the light was farther to the right (south), but still at the same apparent height. Even disregarding the movements of the light, I’m certain we weren’t seeing a planet. I later looked up the planet positions for that location, date and time, and found that Venus was the only planet that could have been visible in that general direction. However Venus was only approximately 5 degrees above the horizon at 5 AM, so I don’t think we could see it at all, because it wouldn’t have risen above the hills yet. Venus would not reach the correct height until around 8 AM. There were (5) witnesses altogether: Three adult males in their forties, all business executives from Houston, and the two sons (ages 14 and 12) of one of the men. None of us have had any previous experience with UFO’s. D&#39;Hanis, Texas (Medina County) Location: 29:19:49N 99:16:46W Elevation: 886 feet<n>

She opened her eyes and stated to me, that the being was surprised that she had opened her eyes and looked at him as his hand was on her leg.  My daughter (Ashley) suddenly received a visual image in her mind of a craft and 05 beings were in our back yard (she drew me a picture).  I know I&#39;m not crazy!  I knew my daughter has had visits, but it&#39;s really upset me that my son has had them for years too.  I&#39;ve had them all of my life.  When I finally got my son to talk about his visits, he told me...that was why he always slept under his bed and in the closet as a kid<n>

I powered across the sky from north east to north west and was only in sight for around one minute. I felt that if I had gone to get my cacorder, I would miss it. it was very high, a kind of orange setting sun look about it, no noise at all, the sky was clear and very cold.<n>

I called her and she went to tell her father.  She went to him and said &#34;Dad, you won&#39;t belive this.

I couldn&#39;t quite estimate whether they were above the sea or the islands cos there was a building blocking and I was driving but I know that it was somewhere in between. It was quite big, maybe 50-80 meters? Some parts of the object were darker, but they still shined, the upper part of the craft was so shiny it kind of hurt to look at. It was there for quite a while but I only got to see it for a minute or so because i was driving. Later on that day I came back to look like an hour or so later, but it had already gone.<n>

I was outside of the city limits, fishing at a local canal. Behind me, I hear a rush of wind in the trees. I turned and saw a Disk hovering about 50 feet above the trees and shining a blue light on me. I was so scared at first I could not move. But then I didn&#39;t feel scared and walked toward it. It was silent and the wind had died down. Completely calm and the blue light followed me as I walked like it was leading me to it. As I got under it I could see different lights and faces looking at me but with no expression. The object was metalic black in color. I felt like I was frozen there for hours but it was more like 10 minutes. We just looked at each other. I got scared and urinated on myself. Then it slowly lifted up and shot away at an extremely fast pace.<n>

Long row of lights too bright for me to see shape of craft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was traveling South on 408 Spur at approx. 2:00 A.M. in late December 1999.  I was approaching a large hill which sits just off the Spur on the West side.  I noticed very bright lights moving in the trees along the top of the hill and moving in Easterly Direction.  My immediate thought was, &#34;Hey, there is someone driving through those trees up there. I&#39;ve never seen anyone driving around up there.  Must be someone doing off road stuff.  Wow the lights are bright, could be more than one driving around up there.&#34;  As the lights got to the East edge of the hill where I wondered if I would be up to the hill in time to see them drive down toward the highway, suddenly the lights just came out from behind the hill in the air!  I did not expect that!  A string of very bright lights emerged slowly and stopped directly over the highway up ahead. I would estimate the length of the object to be about as long as Texas Stadium!  I could not see the shape of it or the sillouette of it for the brightness of the lights.  I continued driving but was stupified at what I was looking at!  After it stopped, it reversed direction and proceeded to go back the direction it came from. (West) It disappeared behind the hill and very quickly I arrived at the spot where it had stopped over the highway.  I looked to my right expecting to get a good look at whatever it was and all I saw was the lights of Grand Prairie, Arlington, and Fort Worth spread out in all their spleandor!  There were no bright lights. There was no object.  If it had been there and had just turned its lights off, I would have seen a sillouette with all of the city lights .  It just vanished!  I have been driving home from night shift for 13 years and this is the one and only strange thing I have seen in the air! My main reason for reporting this event at this time is just to edify you in your investigation.  In case you received another report from someone else concerning this same event and my report could corroborate their report.<n>

It was stationary for 2 or 3 hours.  5 people watched off and on for about 3 hours.  Another neighbor also watched this object.  1 person who stayed up and kept checking on it said later there were more objects and that they formed a pattern in the sky.  I went on the web to check Dr. Sky and see what was in the SE area and Jupiter seemed to be the only object.  Could it have been Jupiter I thought?  But flashing colored lights?  Very strange.  We believe we saw a UFO, however I wish it would have been closer.<n>

As the object came closer it appeared to get larger, very bright, and spikes coming out of it. I was the passenger in the car, my brother driving. I couldn`t believe what I`m seeing, so I told my brother who is driving to look to right up the mountain. I needed him to view the object because his eyes are better than mine. He seen everything I did and confirmed what I was looking at. Of course I viewed it longer, because he had to drive. I was getting a little scared at what I was seeing because it was getting closer to us. Well we lost sight of it at that point, because of our distance traveling. We did see the object one more time about three miles more up the road, but at more of a distace away. Then if disapeared. I would say this object was at least, 300 yards in diameter. The strange part of all this is, we forgot about seeing this object. It wasn`t until 4 months later that it popped back into my head. I can home that day and asked my brother about it again, he said he forgot about it also, untill I had reminded him of the event. about me:I`m 44 years old and Iv`e worked for General Motors for the last 23 years, and I consider myself very level headed, as for my brother.<n>

At times it would make quick moves up/down and diagonally, and then move randomly again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My wife noticed a light in the night sky. The night was clear and the event was witnessed from our livingroom window. The object appeared to have a white and red light.  At first, she thought it was a plane.  It is very common to see planes in the sky due to the air traffic between the Portland, Me and Boston airports. We usually can determine an airplane in the sky by the lights and the way they appear to move.  What made this so interresting is this object moved distinctly different than the planes.  She watched it for about 15 minutes, then woke me up to take a look. I immediately could tell this was no ordinary plane.  It appeared to be dancing, or moving in random directions, not fast and not in right angles.  It would periodically seem to move quickly up or down, and diagonally, but not far. From our vantage point, we were looking toward the northeast.  There were other air traffic in the sky, but these were normal airliners from the aiports.  There were no other objects in the immediate vicinity. We could not determine any features of the object;  just the lights.  I estimate the object to be approximately 2 - 5 miles away and about 45 degrees up past the horizon. My sister-in-law who lives adjecent to us has said she has seen this in the past also. My wife is 34 years old, administrative specialist for a major supermarket chain. I am 35 years old, ex-navy, submarine, nuclear reactor operator.  I am currently a technical trainer for a semiconductor equipment company. I am baffled as to what this was.  It appears that this object is not an airplane, commercial or military.  My only explaination is maybe a remote control airplane (like a toy), but why at midnight?<n>

I can&#39;t remember exactly the date. My friend and I had just seen the fires heading north on the freeway towards my house. When we got there I got out of the passenger side of his car and shut the door. He started driving off headed west as i looked east. There was this gigantic silent maroon/orange/red ball/sphere/fireball thing just fixed in the sky not moving. It was quite low. I was frozen for a second in thought. I actually thought it to be the moon and some sort of apocalyptic thing, although it was not where the moon was supposed to be. I turned around to alert my friend, but he was pulling away. At that point I felt a great fear and kind of panic. I looked at it for another moment and then went into the house and kind of ignored my family. I regret deeply not staying out to watch it or alerting my family. I was seriously freaked out, though! I sat in my room and did just about anything to divert my attention from what i had just seen. Then at about 1:30 AM, i went outside and the moon was just how and where it should&#39;ve been, which was northwest in the sky to where this very strange object was. I spent that night and the next two days silent and contemplative of it. Everything i could imagine it to be went through my head.<n>

There were no immediate city lights, the sky was incredibly clear.  The moon had not come up yet into view. We first noticed the light in the middle of the big dipper. An unknown sized craft moved from east to west rapidly, it was much higher than planes that were coming in on approach to land at our nearby airport. We thought it was a shooting star, quickly discounted that in favor of a satellite, but then halfway through the movement across the sky, multi-colored lights suddenly started twinkling on it. It took about 15 to 20 seconds to cross the sky, maximum.  It was about 1/3 as fast as a shooting star, stayed in a fairly straight pattern although it did seem to curve off at the end.  We walked out into the field trying to follow it, but it disappeared into a horizon of tree tops.  There was no sound and we did not observe a contrail. It was moving too fast for a jet, we both felt.<n>

We got out our telescope out and realized it was something we had never seen before. Electrically charged we could tell, very colorful straight out of Star Trec looking thing.

I watched the object until trees on the horizon blocked it from view. I thought the object was probably something burning up entering the atmosphere as it streaked across the sky, and when it was almost out of sight I thought I saw a splinter of light seperate. There were no navigation lights and it was larger than any meteor I ever saw. I have seen satellites but this was larger and brighter. This object left no tail, which is curious to me as I witnessed the space shuttle reentering the atmosphere to land in Florida. I am a pilot and my wife is a nurse.<n>

It was well past sunset at about 0100Z 27 Dec 1999. The earth satellite appararently flew into the terminator (it disappeared while high overhead).  Within a moment or so, a white lighted object overtook and passed us in fairly close proximity.  The object was first noted south of our west to east course at a distance estimated to be from about 2 to 5 miles.  It appeared to be at nearly the same or a slightly higher altitude.  The object showed only a bright white light that appeared to be slightly disturbed by turbulence, or very slightly pulsating.  It&#39;s course appeared constant as did its alititude.  It passed us and faded rather quickly from sight in a very brief amount of time, perhaps as long as forty seconds.  A query was made to Memphis Center ARRTC as to any possible traffic.  The controller said he had nothing on his scope that could be what we saw.  We saw nothing on our TCAS, set to observe other transponders within 4,000 feet of our altitude and withi;n 20 miles of horizontal distance.  No red (left wing)position light and no fuselage red rotating beacons were sighted by any of the witnesses.  No magnetic or electrical disturbances on our aircraft occurred. At least one passenger noted the object pass by our craft from the passenger cabin.<n>

I had just looked at the clock and it was between 18:10 and 18:13 in the evening.  It was dark and the sky was clear.  A lighted objected caught my eye.  It appeared to be low in the sky, traveling at a high rate of speed from north to south.  The light appeared to be incandescent (white/yellow). What caught my attention was that there was no red/green lights or a flashing on/off light that is common to airplanes.  In the short time that I saw the object, it appeared to have two compartments (all that I could perceive).  The lights in the rear compartment seemed to dim until they went out. After that the front compartment lights went out as if they were switched off.  When the lights were out, I couldn&#39;t see the object anymore. My estimated time of viewing was about 10 seconds.<n>

I was leaving Nevada Fitness at approximately 5:00pm, the sun had already set and the sky was orange in the background, still lit slightly. Walking west towards my car and looking southwest above the mountain range, I saw an unusual object. It was triangular in shape. The two sides were beams of light bright orange the color of the sun, but the bottom and inside was transparent. About the size of a very large aircraft, it wasn&amp;#8217;t moving or if it was it was very slow. I watched it as long as I could but I had to leave. I could see it from the freeway but lost it when I turned North. When I looked for it after that it was gone. The first thing that came to my mind was the Star Trek movie about the whales, when the ships cloaking device didn&amp;#8217;t work properly.  Was this craft being camouflaged by the sunset but accidentally became visible?<n>

It was approx. 25-30 degrees above the horizon line and moved at a very quick pace. It grew in intensity as it passed over Huntington,but it never revealed a strobe or flashing beacon light. It looked like a football travelling horizontally. from my S/W(my left) to N/E(my right). I watched and followed it till it went out of my view. The sky was crystal clear,the waning moon was visible and I could even see white con tails that streaked the pre-dawn sky. Not a sound could be heard as it traveled at a very quick clip. Perhaps 5x&#39;s as fast as the passenger jet I had seen a few minutes earlier. Just a football shaped light as big as a grain of rice held at arm&#39;s length.No contrail, marker lights or sound. Looked the same coming as it did going.<n>

Our one friend always said he saw weird stuff up there, but we never believed him. Just 2 nights ago amazed my beliefs. A single aircraft was blinking a reddish light, and on occasion it would blink a single off-white light 3 times.The weird thing was, where it came from , it would keep going back. Back and forth repeatedly. 3 others eventually showed up, flashing an off-white color 3 times. The part that shocked me was when all 4 got near each other they stopped. And headed opposite directions from where they were coming. I didn&#39;t hear an airplane, nor a helicopter. This was very strange. They would keep coming back to the same spot where we saw them again and again. Going back, and than coming back. Again, no helicopters or airplanes were heard. When all 4 finally left, or so I thought, an object appeared out of nowhere. A really bright light showed up, it kind of looked like the North Star, but it wasn&#39;t. It would get dimmer and dimmer. And flash back to a bright white light. The really bothered us, so we drove away. I&#39;ll tell you one thing, it made me a believer. You HAVE to believe me, I&#39;m not crazy.<n>

Missing time event followed. Family awoke at home the next day unsure how they arrived only recalling seeing UFO.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Returning home on Christmas night from an out-of-town trip to Oklahoma, a family of four decided to make a restroom stop at a I-44 rest area just outside of Mt. Vernon, MO at about 11:00 pm CST.  While returning to their car they began to notice a buzzing noise.  The son told his father to look up at an object just above the trees.  The father, mother and sister also looked up.  They observed a dark chevron craft hovering nearby. The next thing they recall is waking up in their home the next morning. They didn&#39;t know how they got home, parked the car in the garage, unpacked luggage and presents, put presents under their Christmas tree, or got dressed for bed.  The father said his eyes were very sensitive to light when he awakened, but no other unusual bodily effects were noted by any family member.  They were perplexed how they arrived back home which was only less than a half hour drive from the rest area. An investigator from OARG checked out the rest area the following day and did not detect any evidence of trees damaged, parking lot debris, or ground vegetative effects.  HE also checked the family car for any signs of unusual marks or debris.  None was found. The mother is concerned as well as the father and daughter about the incident, but the son said its &#34;cool&#34;.  The mother is considering regressive hypnosis but a recent dream on Jan. 7, 2000 may have changed this opinion.  The mother had a dream which she was out on the back deck of their house with all of her family.  They were looking up the same craft they saw at the rest area like they were in a daze.  She screamed to wake herself up from sleeping.

It also almost looked transparent, almost like it was a thick piece of glass.  The only way I could see it at all was because the star light was being refracted at the edges as it moved through the sky.  There was no sound, and it seemed quite large, but since I don&#39;t know how far away it was I don&#39;t really know how big it was.<n>

The weather was partly overcast at that time with a cloud ceiling of approximately 2,000-3,00 ft.  I looked to the NE and saw a large chevron/boomerang shape moving slowly under the cloud layer.  At first I thought it was an airplane but this object had no fuselage or tail.  I watched for about 7 sec. and stuck my head in the kitchen door and called a friend outside to try to get another point of view.  She came out and I asked her if she saw the object or heard any sound.  At this time the object was passing overhead at about a 15 degree angle.  She could not see it, I supposed because her eyes were not yet accustomed to the light.  I continued to observe and I got a real good look at it.  There was no moon to the south/east/north so it was not a shadow.  I could not see a defined leading edge of the &#34;wing&#34;, it looked so black and impossibly thin.  It almost reminded me of smoke.  I kind of thought it was a flock of geese, but it did not change shape.  As I continued looking I could see the faded orange glow of the Poughkeepsie Galleria mall lights along the rear edge.  I could see surface texture so the object was not smooth.  The orange glow was jagged, and there was a small &#34;squarish&#34; bump on the right side.  The craft still made no noise.  I continued to study the object untill it dissapeared from view in the treeline.  I estimate the size of the object to be approximately 200 to 300 feet wide from tip to tip.  It was flying just under the clouds and looked to be flying under 100 mph.  I still havent figured this one out.  No drinking or drugs were involved.<n>

They were traveling east at a very very slow rate of speed.<n>

The object was not traveling in an exact straight line because at times it seemed to be slightly moving  from side to side but continued to move in a southerly direction. I had time to get my binoculars and on closer inspection of the object when it was almost directly overhead of us I could see a dark triangular body (because of the stars behind it) around the orange colored donut shaped light. I could also see a dark triangle in the center of the orange light. I estimate the object to have been maybe 1,000 ft across from tip to tip. As the object continued south the orange light became brighter and seemed to display brighter flashes now and then, almost like the afterburners on a fighter jet. After a few bright flashes another object looking very similar seemed to appear in front of the original object, and it happened very fast. You could also see a rope like outline connecting the two objects. Then a third, fourth, and fith object appeared out in front of the last in a similar fashion. At this point we had been watching the objects for about 10 minutes and they were near the southern horizon below the Orion constellation when they faded quite rapidly. Neither me nor my friend have ever seen anything like this. We live in southern california 75 miles south-east of Los Angeles, and this object when it first appeared to us it was in the north-west maybe over the L.A. basin at a very high altitude, then when it was almost directly north of us, maybe over Antelope Valley - Big Bear, it made a sharp turn to the south and came right over us and kept on a southerly course towards Mexico&#39;s airspace.<n>

I&#39;m a light sleeper, but I was roused from my slumber because I felt like something was &#34;out-of-place.&#34;  It was a weird intuitive feeling that someone/something was outside peering in.  I had the window blinds open and since I&#39;m nearsighted, the bright light was blurry and very large (grapefruit size) through the glass, until I put my glasses on, then as the light came into focus, I could tell that it was something in the sky.  I watched it for a bit, but after seeing that the light was stationary, my curiousity prevented me from going back to sleep.  The light hovered; it was not a airplane or helicopter.  And there were smaller red lights, located around the edges of the white central light, which blinked slowly.  As I watched the light through the window on and off for over an hour (I finally got up and got ready for a trip to see family), I noticed that the light moved from window pane to another; meaning that it was slowly moving across the sky.  The UFO was hovering above the ground at what I would estimate at several hundred feet (a little higher than a radio or cell tower).  My window faces south/southwest so the UFO was hovering above northern Williamson County, TN; I live in southern Davidson County near Brentwood.  My apt. is on the 3rd floor atop a good-sized hill, so I have a fantastic view of the horizon through my bedroom window. I&#39;m a 31-year old, well-educated, white male, and I have seen UFOs before, but I&#39;ve never reported one until now.  A UFO that I saw a couple of years ago hovering in urban Nashville was seen by several people and the local newspaper (Tennessean) ran an article, but I did not notice an article regarding this UFO siting.  This siting was extremely vivid and I&#39;m convinced that it was &#34;real&#34;; because the image has stuck with me, I&#39;ve decided to report it to someone that might find the information useful.<n>

I was checking the doors and turning the lights out when I noticed a bright star in the north/northeast lower sky. It looked too large to be a star and assumed at first that maybe it was an airplane. However, it did not appear to be moving. I didn&#39;t pay too much attention to it until I decided to get my telescope to look at it closer. But my telescope was too high to look at it through my front windows, so I took it off the tripod. It took a little while as the lights were off. When I looked back up the object was gone. I went to the doorway at the east side of the house and saw the object from underneath. I then realised that the object was triangular in shape with lights around the base and a trail, like that of a comet, at the rear. I could only see it from the door for a short time as there is a roof that obstructed the view. I moved to the back of the house to once again see it. I then went to wake my husband to have him see it. I thought that it may have been the space shuttle, but didn&#39;t think it would be flying that low. It did not deviate from the direction it was flying and it took at least 10 to 15 minutes from the time I first saw it until it was out of view. It flew in a north/northeast to south/southwest direction.<n>

It was bright and had a strong white light as it streaked. It was travelling a an amazing amount of speed, leaving a trail of light that would fade quickly after passing section of the sky. Thinking it was simply a shooting star I watched it pass over the sky for about 9 seconds across a section of the dark night sky. Then without any warning it automaticly changed direction, it tuned back about 73 degrees on itself and sped for a few more seconds before dissapearing. Its entrence was as sudden as it&#39;s dissapearence. But for those last 3 seconds the craft flickered like a candles flame glowing a slight red. I have told this sighting to many people but none have beleived me, but I am sure of what I saw and it cant be of this world.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We do not know how this student would have been able to measure the angles he cites during the 12 seconds, or so, that he was witness to the event.

(can i say it another way???)  i noticed in the disc of the sun to the right side abd just lower than the centre of the sun, a long black object.  it was over a quarter of the suns radius and less than half.  it was slim and the feeling i got was that i saw it in profile.  ie.it was a disc shape on edge to me or cigar shaped...but not rounded like a cigar on the ends.  it tapered to the bottom like many of the famous disc shaped objects seen.  (i can&#39;t remember off hand any famous ones by name but the pics taken by the california highway worker on profile edge kind of do it justice.)  it was 8-10 times longer than high.  and tapered to the bottom, not evenly between bottom and top.  (can i say this in another way???) this was seen for about 15-20 minutes at the speed given before.  my feeling at the time was that it was way far away as it didn&#39;t move in relation to the sun.  this would mean a LARGE object way far away to not show any paralax in my moving observation.  or it was closer but moving at a relative speed between me and the sun but closer. frank edwards in his book &#39;FLYING SAUCERS: SERIOUS BUSINESS&#39; tells of an astronomer in mexico (book publ&#39;d in late &#39;60&#39;s &#39;70&#39;s) who saw streams of objects between him and the sun like i observed.  except i saw one... for some reason i didn&#39;t confirm with anyone else on the bus. i can write to you by snail mail with topographical maps so you can get coordinates on where exactly i was and a sketch of what i saw... i heard of y&#39;all on &#39;art bell&#39;  (where else?...) and thought it was the perfect place to tell...

Slowly drifted diagonally toward horizon.  After 5 or 10 min. it grew transparent and finally vanished.<n> <n><n> <n><n> (I already reported this to CO Mufon who were intrigued.) Before sunrise on Xmas eve I was talking on phone with a relative when a small but brilliant light, low in the south-eastern sky caught my attention.  It did not seem to move and after a few minutes I reached for binoculars (always at hand for bird-watching) and continued talking while gazing at the object.  It was the size of a large comet but flattish on bottom and rounded on top, with not-quite-sharply-defined edges.  It wavered and shimmered like something seen through heated air.  It was quite beautiful: my subjective reaction.  I am in my 60&#39;s, have spent much time gawking at the skies, but have never seen anything comparable.  It was absolutely not a cloud, nor a flock of birds. After 10 minutes or so it had drifted below the level of the telephone wires across the road (I must add that this object seemed several miles away, tho hard to estimate.) and very slowly grew evanescent, transparent, invisible, maintaining its exact cohesive shape until the end. My opinion for what it&#39;s worth is that I witnessed a transition from one vibrational phase to another.<n>

Further, the distance that we traveled from the highway to home was too far for it to have been a  lighted tower and we kept it in sight until it dropped below the horizon.  Perhaps some astronomical event.  It was smaller than the moon, about half of last night&#39;s moon.  Extraordinarily bright, white and it did not blink.

On the 23rd of Dec. 1999 at about 10:15 pm an extraordinary light show of an unknown origin appeared over the Arkansas Valley near the small town of Howard, Colorado. I was alerted to this past sighting by a local resident of Salida, Colorado. This individual told me of the sighting through close friends of her&#39;s that were driving along Hwy. 50, along with many other witnesses who saw this bright light in the night sky... Some witnesses thought it was &#34;CHRIST&#39;S SECOND COMING&#34; as the light was so profound and bright in colors of red and white, very intense and very prominent. This story is ongoing and in Salida, Colorado, the TRAVEL CHANNEL television show will be in town interviewing witnesses of resent and past UFO sightings this coming week The local paper the MOUNTAIN MAIL from Salida, Colorado, did a small piece on this sighting, and interviewed a local resident there on the upcoming TRAVEL CHANNEL Show. From my understanding this is a first on this sighting and along with the photo, which I will send later. Some witnesses need to be interviewed, we will post more findings later. R. G.

The in-laws live approximately 15 miles out of town; which is a very rural area of Hempstead county just outside the town of Hope, AR.  The local small airport and tower is also North and West of Hope, AR, but on a seperate State road #278.  The road I was traveling on was highway # 73; which is approximately 3 to 5 miles West of 278.  To get to the airport one must travel US 278 for about 5 miles from the city limits of Hope, AR.  I was approx 5 miles on US 73 heading NW when I told my wife to look at that plane with his landing lights on.  He sure is low to the ground and even though the airport was only approx 2 to 3 miles due east he was too low to land at any of the 3 runways there.  I told her to pull over and back up because we were on a straight stretch that was approx 1/2 mile long, I said it looks like he is trying to land on the road. As we pulled over the light changed directions from due west and turned toward us just above several houses and 50 to 75 ft oak trees.  I told her to put it into reverse and back up as fast as possible.  Just as she got into reverse, the light was aimed toward us but not upon our vehicle.  It appeared to hover just above the farm and chicken houses and oak trees that are adjacent to US 73.  I rolled down my window to listen and get a better look, had my wife shut off the engine.  It was a clear bright night, crisp cold air, no visible clouds in the sky and stars were plentyful.  I got out and looked at the object hoovering maybe 1/4 mile from us, only a front white light on, but the shape was unmistakenably triangle.  I could not hear any noise coming from the object, only the sound of chicken houses and the occassional dog barking.  With the crisp cold air I thought any sound from the craft would be easy to hear and travel far, but no one in the houses came out to look at the object,nor did the poultry appear scared.  After maybe 1 1/2 minutes to 2 minutes the object turned the light off, turned due West and took off very slowly and then just sped up so fast it was gone.  The object turned on its axis without forward movement, engine sound or any visible jet blast or thrust  from what I called the rear of the craft after the point turned due west.  I have seen 4 other craftin my past and present, but none of them gave me the close up view like the triangle vehicle did.  I did look ((initials deleted))<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))<n>

I stood in the courtyard of our appartment complex and snapped 3 fotos of the Moon in about 10 seconds.  I viewed each shot on the digital display, on the back of my camera, just to mak sure the shot was good, and then immediately took another shot.  I was unaware of anything in the photos but the Moon and the sky.  It was only after downloading them into my computer, and viewing them, was I able to detect a strange green dot in each of the images.  I use a viewing program called &#34;ACDSee&#34; that really puts up the images fast, so, after noticeing the green dot in each one, I clicked on each image in succession, and could detect that whatever it was, it moved from left to right and then back left again.  I then decided to enlarge and enhance them to try to detect what the object actually looked like.  It turned out to look somewhat like a marker-bouy, possibly hexagonal at the bottom, and with a center that protruded upward from the larger haxagonal platform at the bottom.  After enhancement, the object in the 3rd image seems to have a yellow luminance on the tip of the protrusion, but the object definately has a green appearance overall.  Not having noticed the object with my own eyes, I can&#39;t tell whatever other moves it made, but it certainly covered a lot of space in 9 to 10 seconds, (the total time sequence of the 3 shots).  I have the original JPEG&#39;s and the enlarged and inhanced JPEG&#39;s, done with Paint Shop Pro 6.  Contact me via e-mail if you wish any of these shots. ((e-address deleted))<n>
12/22/99 19:15|White Sands|NM|Light|2 min|A  starlike object descended vertically for 2 minutes changing color from a very bright white to gold  the closer it got to the ground.|1/7/00|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/011/S11529.html|82|ndxe199912| A  starlike object descended vertically for 2 minutes changing color from a very bright white to gold  the closer it got to the ground. The light landed at Holloman AFB ever so slowly decellerating to a stop on the airstrip. As the light decended there were 3 stealth fighter jets circling at approximately a 14 mile radius. All 3 jets landed directly after the event.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As we were leaving the White Sands Natl. monument at approximately  19:15 pm mst. after watching the solstice full moon rise, I noticed due east a  piercing white light, about half the size of my little finger held at arms length, decending from approx. 5000 ft. vertically very slowly toward the middle of Holloman AFB. I stopped the car, grabbed the binoculars, and watched the object decend for approx. 2 minutes. 2 others got out of the car and 2 others watched from within the car. I noticed 3 circling stealth f-117 nighthawks circling the light in an approx.14 mile diameter circle. The object was approx 7 miles away and through the binoculars looked just like a very bright light with no stobes, beacons , or any other kind of aircraft type navigational lights. As the object neared the ground I noticed the underside of the light changing to a mellow yellow-gold glow. I then passed the binoculars off to another friend. The light did not seem to stop and hover, it decended in a very deliberate yet exponetially slower manner until it landed at what appeared to be the middle of the airfield. I could not resolve a shape to the intense light, yet at the same distance I had no problem resolving the very dim navigational lights outlining the circling stealth jets. The light could have been a helicopter with some sort of amazingly bright battlefield night light, or an aircraft with a super set of landing lights approaching head on from my position, but from my perspective it definitely looked like a vertical decent of a very bright star with no discernable outlines of any solidity. I could hear the stealth as they flew overhead, but there was no sound from the starlike object. The 2 of us outside with the binoculars were impressed  and amazed that our airforce has come so far with their technology, the others observing from within and outside the car didn&#39;t think much of bright lights descending into an airbase and dismissed our awe as silliness. My overall impression was that it was indeed a more incredible eve! nt than the beautiful full moon rising over white sands that night, and I thought it was definitely worth sharing with the NUFORC. I will email a map with a diagram of my position at the time of the sighting, thanks.<n>

Each time it was traveling in the same general direction, but at a somewhat higher altitude than the first time. It seems to have passed over the house just slightly earlier on each event, shortly after sundown just nearing the end of twilight. For your information we live in the flight path of commercial jets traveling to and from Chicago and Las Vegas, I believe, at an altitude of about 30,000 feet. Additionally, with some changes in flight approaches to Teterboro Airport in Teterboro, New Jersey we have an occasional inbound Gulf Stream or Citation at about 1500 feet one of which recently crashed in Pike County. I thought that you might find this as interesting as I did. At 8:00 P.M. on 12-22-99 I received a phone call from my son ((name deleted)) to tell me that at about 7:45 P.M. or U.T.C. 00:45 he sighted a Black Triangle shaped craft fly over our house in rural Northeastern Pennsylvania. Lackawaxen Pennsylvania (Pike County) is about 75 to 80 miles Northwest of New York City. Philip is always outside star gazing, bat watching in summer or just hoping to see a U.F.O. He was outside on the deck looking at the best full moon in 133 years. Because of the brightness of the moon he got a pretty good look at the craft. He says it had a wing span of about 80 to 100 feet wide. It was not smooth on the bottom but somewhat bumpy or rough I guess. He says that he only heard it about 3 seconds before he saw it. It came out of the Southwest and headed Northeast. ((name deleted)) estimated the altitude at around 400 feet. The sound it made was not a propeller or jet aviation engine, but rather what he described as a vibration such as you might experience in an earthquake. It seems to have not been going particularly fast.((name deleted)) describes it as having a whitish glow in front and several red navigation lights on top. He feels that it was not wide enough to have a pilot on board and could see no cockpit type configuration which lead him to conclude that it was some sort of drone craft which he had read about somewhere. One point which I was fascinated by is that he says the wide part of the triangle was the front and the narrow point of it was the tail section unlike a stealth fighter. As stated above, since the first sighting of this craft, my son has seen it on a number of other occasions. Each time it was traveling in the same general direction but at a somewhat higher altitude than the first time. It seems to have passed over the house just slightly earlier on each event, shortly after sundown just nearing the end of twilight.I might clarify something contained above. The whitish glow in front of the craft upon more extensive discussions with my son seems to have been exceptionally bright aircraft type aviation landing lights. The red light on the corners of the craft at one time appeared to be more of an orange color (different craft?) or multi stage lighting? I hope that you find this information useful! A few additional Comments in the words of my son: I have seen it a total of six times since the first sighting. In the first sighting it went about 150 to 200 M.P.H. and has increased to an estimated 500 M.P.H. as of the last sighting on Thursday 2-3-00. I am not certain that it is the same craft each time since the size and light colors have changed from sighting to sighting. Each time the craft is a black triangle. I think that this area is being used as a test area for military aircraft. The path it follows is almost always the same directly over the house or just a little North of the house but not very far away. It is something that you cannot hear as it comes up to you, it sort of sneaks up on you then when it goes over above you it makes a very loud noise like a diesel power generator on a train. Then after it passes over you it gets quiet again very fast.<n>

I never had a sighting I was confident was a ufo until this morning.  I was going out to the truck to go to work this morning at 6:30am.  I noticed to the west, the sky was completely cloudy, but to the east everything was perfectly clear.  As I looked to the east, I noticed an amber light that was brighter and larger than any of the visible stars in the sky.  When I became aware of the stationary nature of the object, I began to talk out loud to it, asking it to come closer.  When I said that, the light grew in intensity, but was still a considerable distance from me.  At 6:35am, I got in truck and began to drive in the general direction of the light hoping to get more detail.  After driving a half mile to the east, I stopped the truck and rolled down the window.  Even though light was still some distance from me, I waved at it.  Almost immediately the amber light went off, revealing a constant, smaller red light.  In a matter of two seconds, the red light had moved beyond visible distance toward the east.<n>

I marked it off as a water tower. about 1mi. I came to another well lighted lot and saw the same object. color was like a tan or rust toned stainless steel. No noise. The object was moving west, same direction of which I was traveling. Could only see it while passing those two lighted lots. It was less than 100 feet off ground. I have been back to the area, there are no water towers nor any thing else to explain what this hugh object could be. Flat on bottom, angled slightly up to a flatter surface, then angled up much much more to the top.<n>

As I crossed over the county line I saw an object in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I crossed the county line I saw what appeared to be two blue lights in the sky to my left. At first I dismissed them as an airplane, but apon closer observation it did not appear to be lights to an air plane. It seemed to be moving to slow, and the wingspan seemed a lot bigger than any airplane I had ever seen. The two blue lights were on both ends of the object. I proceeded down the road watching this object in the sky. It came from the southwest out of Jackson county. This area is farm and woods, within a few miles of a tri county junction. Eaton,  Ingham, and Jackson Counties all come together in this area. It came in from Jackson County in the southwest sky. Slowly moved in at about 25-30 miles an hour. I watched and tried to figure out what it was. I then thought it looked like a helicopter, carrying some kind of lighted shaft or tube. similar to what is used for major construction for setting or carrying posts.  but I had never seen one at night and no post I had ever seen had lights on it.As I approached tucker road it was just starting to clear some trees and coming across an open field. I noticed it was moving very slow and was only about 35-40 feet above the tops of the trees. I was driving by the open field whatching and saw that it was not a Helicopter but it appeared to be one solid peice as though the shaft or tube was not being carried but was actually part of the object. it was about as wide as an airplaine is long but skinny in the middle. It did not move straight through the air but actually sideways.  From looking at it from underneath of it was shaped like a crooked star. Realy long sideways  but all ends pointed with a tube sticking out of the middle pointing at the ground. At the top of it it seemed to be a dome type lid that was poited ontop. It actually resembled a cigar tube that was pointed on each end, that had some kind of tube or shaft on the bottom and had apointed dome shaped top. It had a light on the top of it that resembled a search light but it did not point in any! one dir ection it seemed to be cicling the top and wasnt like a spot light, it just seemed to glow bright. On the bottom shaft that pointed at the ground there were blue and white lights that appeared to be stationary and did not move. however on the side of the object there was a very bright red light thatmoved from bottom of the center pieceto the bottom of toppiece it would move up disapear reapear on the bottom move up and disapear and continued doing so for the entire time I whatched it. I was able to get a very good look at the object since it flew directly above the hood of my car. It floated slowly across a field to the right of me. It headed toward Ingham county on a direct path. By this time I had already stopped the car. I rolled down the window andbrought half my body out of the driver side window and looked across the roof of the car and watched as it flew past the next tree line. I never heard an engine or anythin coming from the object. I have a very quite car and that was all I could hear everything was practically silent. I got back in and started driving slowly owards home going farther into eaton county as it made its way into ingham. I contimplated since it was moving so slow to turn back around and follow it but when I  turned around to look at it again it was gone.<n>

As there were aircraft in the area, she expected it to move, but it didn&#39;t. It was a very clear afternoon, with the mountains in clear view, and no stars in sight. After watching the light for a minute or so, she decided to stop and try to figure out what it was,shortly after she stopped it zigg-zagged downward and disappeared. As she is not a UFO believer, she is hesitant to call this a UFO sighting, but she was excited and confused by what she saw.   Could you let us know if there were any more sightings at this time and location?<n>

My father is a retired U.S. Air Force Lt. Col. fighter pilot, so I have quite a bit of knowledge when it comes to things flying in the skies due to his shared experiences and the many hours of spending time at USAF bases and air shows with him. On Tuesday, December 21st at approximately 3:30 in the afternoon, I was driving alone southbound on Interstate 5 just past downtown Seattle and noticed a silverish-grey, spherical metallic object hovering in the sky at what I would guess to be at a height of about 500-700 ft. up and at a distance from me at around 6-8 miles in the southern sky (over the Southcenter Mall area). If I were to put my hand at arms length, it would have been just slightly smaller than my thumbnail. It moved up and down several times...not like a balloon does in a floating manner with a wind, but moving up, stopping for a second, then moving down then stopping. It did this several times then went from left to right a few times in the same manner. The area it covered in these maneuvers would be maybe 30-40 ft? (probably about an area the size of my fist at arms length) Then it seemed to shrink in on itself and just vanished completely. There were a few passenger aircraft in the sky due to it&#39;s close proximity to SeaTac International Airport, but nothing close enough that it would have been a danger...at least not during the time I witnessed it. Total time from the moment I saw it until it vanished was about 30 seconds.<n>

The night was very clear and the ocean was calm with no breeze.  All night I observed what I thought was a star but as i would look at it, it would change shape flatten out and show blue,red and green lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Around 3:30A.M. I was awake and I was sitting staring at this so called star when in my mind i said i know you are not a star let me see what you&#39;re doing.  Well this craft started to spin. That is when i realized it was pretty close and very big it started to move east ward over the ocean. It moved very slowly out over the ocean then it started to put on a light show. It would shine a beam of light on the water once to the left and then to the right. The be-em of light was very big. then it move on again. It seemed to do this a few times and then i saw a few smaller lights come toward the craft and merge with it.  The last thing i observed was out of this was a very red light i have never seen this color of red be-fore it seemed to be sent back toward the land not so much towards me but over to an out cropping of rock&#39;s On these rocks live hundreds of sea Lyons they make noises all the time at this spot. At the time the very red light disappeared i was to say the least very exhausted and freaked out but also excited by what i saw. In closing I am sorry I have not shared this with any UFO people until now but I sure would like to discuss my observation with some-one who can give me some information on what i experienced.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.

When I came past the hill and was on the water front looking at the mouth of Halifax harbour I noticed that there was a ball of fire in the sky.  I could actually see what looked like smoke rising from what ever it was.  It was definetly a few hundred feet in the sky with nothing underneath.  I was able to see the reflection of the light from this object on the water.  I do not know how long this lasted, however, I watched the object in the sky stationary for about 10 minutes.  What I also noticed was another object which I believe may have been a helicopter circling the object counter clockwise.  I am confident it was circling because it would come from behind the object fly around in my field of vision, and then go back in behind.  The object was at least 1 or 2 Kilometers away from me and it was very large.  From the distance I was looking at it looked to be the size of a small building.  The color was steady orange and at the end the object simply faded out and disappeard, but I could still see the smoke that was coming from it disipating.  I could see the other object still circling with the stars in behind.  The other thing I forgot to mention was that this was a clear night with the Moon shining down.  This is the first and only time I have ever seen anything like this. It was definetly a new one to me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

Had a cigarette. i dropped the lit cigarette and pulled over onto the dirt to look for it. Very dark, no other cars. just then a VERY bright light shined in the back window. I thought it was the police. So I got out of the car and faced the back of it. I saw these three crafts hovering like what seemed to be only about 100 ft above me. That was at 10:00 pm. I think at that point I turned to run and I must of slipped and hit my head or something and got knocked out. because when I got up and back into my car(it seemed like only minutes had gone by) The announcer on the radio said it was 2am! So like FIVE hours had gone by. Wierd, huh??<n>

This lasted for approximately 1 min. then completely disappeared. Within 2 minutes, 4 planes appeared to be flying in formation looking for the object. We again saw this object and it&#39;s beam in what seemed like a closer view and we were able to see what looked like 5 exhaust &#34;pipes&#34; from where the light beams came from. Then the light beams seemed to slowly extinquish themselves until there was nothing. We witnessed the object and plane formation two more times while driving to and from this area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As we drove through Stoughton after taking the exit 19B to rte. 138 enroute to Canton Christmas, my son and I saw a Bright round luminous object in the sky.  This object was much bigger than any star we have seen and the beam of light coming from it was straight and round, long and thick beam. Then after about what seemed a minute, the object suddenly disappeared from the sky.  About 2 minutes later we witnessed 4 planes take v-formation in the sky and they appeared to be searching for something. As we drove down 138, we again seen this object. This time it appeared to be bigger, perhaps closer and we were able to see the exhaust area that the beams came from.  The exhaust area looked like 5 round holes, brightly lit. As we witnessed this object for the 2nd time, we both felt our hearts stop and were extremely frightened. Just then the object disappeared, shortly thereafter, the 4 planes took formation.  On the way back from Canton as we approached the Christmas Tree Shoppe parking lot, we again seen the object, it appeared as it did earlier with the beam of light but now it sort of had a trailing light also. As we watched, a young man approached and looked into the sky. My son pointed to the object and the young man stood looking with his mouth wide open.  He yelled to us that he could see it also.  Just then, it disappeared and sure enough, here comes the 4 planes in formation.  We then went inside the Shop.  After approximately, 40 minutes, we left and while driving on rte. 24 towards Brockton, we witnessed the object again. This time it seemed very brief, but once again the planes came in formation.<n>

Observed it through a telescope. Seen a cluster of 15 to 20 disk shaped objects.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am an amateur astronomer. I started observing the night sky with my telescope Saturday night, 12/18/99, around 22:30 pm central standard time. Observing location was SW Houston at my place of residence. At approximately 01:15 am central standard time on 12/19/99 I noticed a object moving across the sky with the naked eye. At first glance it looked like a commercial airliner because the speed was about the same. But there was no sound and no blinking lights.  The light was constant with no fluctuation and was copper/amber in color. The object was coming from the southeast and moving toward the west. I was facing the south and looking up.  The object was at about 75 to 80 degrees.  This made me curious as to what the object was. I swung my telescope around and was able to lock onto the object with my 9X50 finder scope. Then I focused my finder scope.  At that point I could tell the object was not an airplane or jet liner. I could make out multiple disc shaped objects all clustered closely together. At that point I lined up the objects in my Astro-Physics 130 mm telescope.  I had to refocus because I was previously observing the moon. I had to bring the focus in closer because the object was definitely closer to earth. My telescope was set up with a 22mm panoptic eyepiece.  This was giving me about 35 times magnification.  I tracked and observed the object across the sky.  There was 15 to 20 disc-shaped objects. They were like bubbles that had been partially flattened. They were dark and transparent looking in the middle of the discs.  The discs were emitting an amber colored light around the outer edge and it was constant and nonfluctuating.  Some of the objects held a steady position as they moved across the sky while others swayed back and forth. All of the discs were of the same size.  I followed them as far as I could to the west util my view was obstructed by a tree. By then the discs were very dim. The cluster stayed together for the duration of my observation.  After I lost site of the objects, ! I contin ued to observe the night sky for another hour.  There was no other objects sited during that time.  I took my compass and lined it up with the direction my telescope was pointed at the last site of the objects.  The compass reading was 275 degrees.  This is almost due west.  A this point I started writing down what had transpired since I had never seen anything like this before.<n>

Just as we got out of town we saw a light in the sky at first we though a falling star, but it was to bright to be a star. As we got closer it got brighter. I asked my boyfriend what it was and he said maybe a tower. As we got closer we saw that it was not just one light but three shaped like a triangle. we followed it until we were directly under it. As it passed over us you could see the shap perfectly of the triangle. After we had passed it I turned to keep watching it out the back window and it was gone. We turned around to look for it but it was Know where to be found. This all happened over a period of fifteen minutes.<n>

It began to slowly move to the south 5 mph, I was by this time pulled off the freeway &amp; was looking with bynoc,s. I saw a six sided structure that was about 10&#39;in lenght &amp; 3&#39; wide. As it slowly moved away to the south, it tilted at dif. angles, with a bright orange glow at the bottom. The sides where lite up orange but very lightly as if transparent but not, all the edges were outlined with the same oange light, but stronger than the side&#39;s, thus outlining the shape. many times it tilted on it&#39;s axis in about 150 degrees upward, never tlting bellow horizontal, it moved from possition to possition stopping at different angles. meaning the six sided structure above the bright orange light was moving independent to the southern movement the intire object was doing. this six sided structure above the bright orange glow moved in halting movement&#39;s.  I got the impression that it was looking for something. Actually it was very beautiful. Then to my astonishment it shrank down to a small point of orange light (about 1/5 it&#39;s original size) &amp; began to move away faster, it was coming towards me at first &amp; was about 200&#39;to 250&#39;up &amp; at it&#39;s closest 75&#39;. as it moved away about a mile it turned into three orange lights in a triangle shape, this was by naked eye due to my getting back into my truck &amp; chasing after it. it then stopped abruptly &amp; went back towards the north west. I slammed on my brakes &amp; jumped out again &amp; by the time I got my bynoc&#39;s trained on it, it was slowing down &amp; then stopped, it immediately lower itself to the ground. it was about 300 to 500 ft. away now, it went into a big stand of tree&#39;s, I could see it on the ground inside the tree&#39;s, but not so good anymore. but I could still see the glow of the orange lights inside the stand of trees.  I watched for about 4 or 5 min, when I desided to try &amp; get closer ! to the s tand of tree&#39;s, I had to get back in my truck &amp; get off the freeway to try &amp; find where it went down, I had no luck in finding it again even though I did find the spot in the tree&#39;s where it went down. I also discovered a large crowd of people standing outside of a house that wasn&#39;t far from where the stand of trees where, I stopped to ask them if they had seen anything, they hadn&#39;t. After I watched this thing land I began to shake a great deal, no dought due to fear &amp; excitement.  I stayed aroud the general area for about 20 min. &amp; saw nothing more.  I was a little tired, but not on drugs or any mind altering substance.  Thank you<n>

((name deleted)) ps the kids said i was outside 30 minutes,it seemed like one minute to me, thats odd.  if you or any one can tell me what we saw please contact me.im sure open for sugestions!

No sound, no additional lights as angle changed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I never thought I would contact you twice in one week(I called about a 2nd-hand report of a blue light over Atlanta earlier in the week.) I am not what you would call a &#34;trained observer,&#34; but I am familiar with the basic characteristics of known conventional aircraft and flight, and I can tell when something is &#34;out-of-the-ordinary&#34;. I am a very poor judge of height/distances/size, etc., but I am good with spatial relationships and observe things from that perspective. I have the benefit of a college education and have a critical and questioning mind. If this was indeed a sighting of a non-human or non-manmade craft, then it was VERY SUBTLE. It was about 5:45 A.M., and I had just returned home from work (I work at night), and was out walking my dog, who often stops and sits down in the driveway if she feels we have not spent enough time outside, so I was standing there with her and star gazing. I turned and faced North looking at a group of stars in the Northern sky (I do not know which constellation) when I noticed one of them (what I first thought was a star) was moving. This star-like light was EXTREMELY high up, to the extent that it looked about the same size and brightness as the stars behind it. It was moving in a straight path at a fairly slow speed, much like what you would expect to see from a regular airplane(in other words, no abrupt movements or turns, etc.) At first, I began thinking about what it could be, perhaps an airliner VERY high up, a satellite (seemed too fast for that), or some other type of spacecraft (I am uninformed about what is up there in orbit right now). As I stared at it, however, it slightly veered off its straight course and began moving more in line with my line of sight/where I was standing, and was getting brighter. After a minute or so, I could tell that it was getting brighter because it was descending. It was a very cold and perfectly clear night, so I had a ski-cap and coat hood over my head, so I began taking everything off to listen for a sound, and there was none. As the light began approaching the point of being overhead, and since it had veered off course slightly, I figured that as it passed, I would be able to see additional or blinking lights if it was a standard airplane, and at the very least I would hear a sound as it passed overhead, neither of which happened. The light, though brighter, maintained its basic appearance of a white, star-like light. As it got closer it seemed to level-off, but was still very high, and I got the feeling that it was coming down to look at or look for something (monitoring/patrolling?). At this point, I thought it might be a morning traffic or news chopper, but that was highly inconsistent with its original altitude when I first saw it. After about 30 seconds of flying at this height/speed, it seemed to increase its speed to what was approximately double its original speed, veered back left to its original path, and began to ascend rapidly. This is where I began to feel funny about this object, as its ascension seemed to cover an extreme vertical distance in a relatively short amount of time, which seemed like highly unlikely behavior from any type of conventional aircraft. Again, this with NO SOUND and NO ADDITIONAL LIGHTS-by this time it had already passed overhead, and there should have been some defining features if it had been a conventional airplane. As the light continued to traverse the sky, it was obviously climbing faster than it was moving horizontally, because it got so high that I could not see it anymore looking straight on. I offset my eyes slightly and continued tracking the light in my periphery, but after a about 60 seconds of this, it was completely out of view (UPWARDS, NOT ON THE HORIZON). In other words, it went so high up that it was no longer visible, and never fully traversed the entire skyscape from horizon-to-horizon. At this point, I had a very odd feeling about what I had just seen. Although it was not very dramatic, just the basic behavior of this &#34;object&#34; did not, in my mind, conform to any behavior, attitude, or flight plan that would be expected from any type of aircraft in near-space or in orbit. It seemed that the ascension (and as I later concluded, the first descension) was just too extreme for a conventional aircraft. Adding to that the missing sounds/additional lights that accompany traditional craft, it added up to be a very unusual sighting. Plus, I just felt strange after seeing it.<n>

We stopped and got out and the objects just stopped and hovered. Then there were at least 3 dimly lit sperical crafts flying and hovering all over each one of the crafts. Every so often 1 or 2 other craft would come out of no where and fly right up to the stationary craft.  Then they would fly off and up into the sky till you couldnt see them anymore. About once an hour a huge black triangle with lights on it would fly pretty close to the ground just like it was patroling and up through the atmosphere.  Then another black triangle took up a hovering formation with the other craft.  We got bored looking at these things just sit there for about a half hour so we got back in the truck and drove home.

We live in a cul-de-sac with a thick pine and hardwood forest behind us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had purchased my first digital camera in 1998. It was a Olympus D500L.  It had only .85 Megapixel (850K Pixels). The aperture and shutter speed are automatic.  Although small by today&#39;s standards the camera took great pictures but digital zoom was very limited.  The camera software allowed the camera to be controlled by a computer.  I wrote a program to allow it to interface with the camera software so I could remotely take pictures in the early morning hours of my backyard and forest behind my workshop.  I had the camera take a picture thru the rear window of my workshop every minute for about two hours every morning beginning well before daylight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Although I didn&#39;t get many pictures of wildlife which I theorized later was because of the red LED which flashed on the front of the camera while a picture was being processed.  I think this spooked the wildlife but thinking back it attracted something else.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At the time I was taking the pictures I had never heard of BOLs (Balls of Light).  I was however an avid UFO skeptic with an open mind.  On or about December 16, 1999 I was reviewing the pics taken that morning and came across two sequential pics with a bright orange-yellow sphere the size of a soccer ball.  I later assumed it to be a sphere rather than a flat round object turned on its end.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The coloration was uniform and pixelized on its border.  The object was only eight to ten feet from the camera.  The first pic was taken in front of a large pine tree which made it possible to judge the size.  The second pic taken one minute later.  The object had moved about two feet to the right and up about a foot.  My first impression was fireflies (lightning bugs).<n> <n><n> <n><n> I soon discounted this because of the brightness of the object.  Even with the aperture wide open and a slow shutter speed I do not believe the camera would flare the light of the firefly to the size of a soccer ball.  My second theory was that it was a reflection from car headlights on the window of a neighbor leaving for work.  I soon discounted this as no possible reflection could get to the rear window of my shop because it was well behind any other homes in the area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I finally gave up and deleted the pics thinking the objects were some kind of camera bug being that digital cameras were so new.  (FYI, about 2009 the forest was timbered behind my house.)<n> <n><n> <n><n> A few months after deleting the pics I was reading about crop circles and BOLs.  A shiver went down my spine as I new at that moment from my perspective that I had deleted two very rare photos.  I obtained file retrieval software in order to recall the pics but to no avail.  I did however retrieve exact pics but without the objects.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I still have this camera and its successor, the D620L (1.4 MP).  Both are in great working order and hope to set up the camera again in the hope of resolving this mystery.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

The sky was mostly clear.  We got out of the car and looked up, hoping to see leftover shooting stars from the Geminid shower.  I saw a circular object, mostly dark brown with a slighty lighter shade in front, flying steadily South-Southeast.  The object showed no lights and made no sound.  It was unusual in its apparent size and altitude.  It might have been a hot air balloon, except I saw no basket or burner.  It could not have been a plane; there were no lights and no wings.  It was no bird; the flight was too high and steady.  The altitude must have been several thousand feet.  I watched for a minute or so as it flew out of my sight. Unprompted, my son asked, &#34;What was THAT? It looked like a flying rock or something.&#34; There were no unusual power outages - my car continued to run during the sighting.<n>

At 1st glance, I thought I was looking at a helicopter, because it was so low to the ground and moving at a low rate of speed; (at 60 m.p.h., I was able to keep up with it.) It maintained a position just ahead of me and to the right about a mile away, maybe 300&#39; in the air. as I continued to watch it. I noticed that it had an elongated diamond shape (&lt;&gt;) and lights that were not at all recognizable as navigation lights. The end points had continuously burning amber lights, while the top and bottom points were bright white and strobed in a fashion similar to those on an ambu- lance. As I got closer to my turn off, I noticed it was veering away from it&#39;s parallel course to me and taking a more southerly course, but still maintaining its slow pace. Approx. 9 miles after 1st spotting it, I turned so. on Halls Creek rd., and, as luck would have it, I was still hot on it&#39;s trail, following Halls Creek due south, as it moved east. I drove the length of the rd. (4.5 mi.) and came to a &#34;T&#34; intersection. I turned left onto Pitts Chapel Rd. with i t still in clear view, so I de- cided to pull off the rd. and get out to get a good  look at it. I was able to watch it un obstructed by trees for approx 30 sec. at 1st, it simply did what it had been doing all along...proceeding slowly, steadi- ly east, but just before it disappeared behind the woods, it did some- thing truly astounding that took away any doubt that it was a genuine ufo; although the craft never once wobbled, pitched or yawled, it did make some radical rising and dipping maneuveres. I KNEW then I was onto something extraordinary. MY pulse racing now, I pushed my car to its max trying to get as close to the object as I possibly could, turning on 4 different roads, over another 8-9 mile stretch, until I found a gravel rd. which turned off the paved rd. in the same direction of the craft. By this time (6:20-6:30pm), the sky was almost completely dark, and as I proceeded down the unfamiliar path, I noticed that the ufo had stopped about 1/2 mile away and hovering roughly 2-300 feet above the trees, I was awstruck by this monumental sight. Finally on solid, stationary ground, I watched it hover over the trees, occasionally darting side-to- side, and up and down in a floating kind of way. I found myself debating whether I could make it home to get my camcorder, but I was afraid that it would be gone for good, so I stayed there to take in the entire ex- perience. It stayed right there above the trees for several minutes, until finally, the four corners of the craft appeared to pull toward the center and consolidate, just before accelerating away from me to dis- appear beyond the tree line... I tried to resume chase, but lost all sight of it.  I don&#39;t know what it was, but I do know for a fact that it absolutely was NOT  a fixed-wing or rotary aircraft of ANY kind...and I can only hope that someone else saw it or video-taped it. I will never forget it as long as I live.<n>

It was Yellowish-orange  with a little blue on one side.  Very bright and moving incredibly fast- much faster than the planes in the area.  It appeared out of nowhere and disappeared from view within about 5 seconds.  Biggest, brightest, fastest moving thing I&#39;ve ever seen in the night sky. I thought the meteor showers were over for now, but that&#39;s what I would have guessed it to be. Went inside.  Came out an hour later and saw two more within a few minutes of each other.  They came from different directions and were slightly smaller and less bright than the first one-or perhaps a little further away. My husband saw a fourth one- more like a flash of light.  We then saw a fifth one, much smaller and white instead of yellow- looked more like a shooting star. I am guessing there were probably many others which we didn,t see, since I was indoors after the first one, and didn&#39;t come baack outside for a hour, when we saw the other four.  Also, there have been heavy contrails made in this area every day in x and circular patterns- all day.  When I drove from Atlanta to Nashville last week, there was heavy spraying the whole way- kept hoping to outdrive them but they were all the way to Nashville-even over the rural and mountainous areas.  What,s going on up there? Lots ofpeople getting sick and staying sick in both areas, as well as in Virginia where there is also heavy &#34;chemtrail&#34; spraying- They&#39;re calling it the &#34;100 day cough&#34; in Virginia.  Any connection between all these things?.  I have heard about UFO&#39;s before, but never was sure I believed it.  But these &#34;fireballs&#34; were really there-quite beautiful actually.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note--The annual Geminid Meteor Shower, which was particularly bright this year, peaked on this night, and the night before.

I walked out to lock my car for the night when I noticed 2, one folllowing the other, meteors, space junk... coming from the north of Las Animas going south. The first blew up, the second flew on by and disappeared. They were in the air a little longer than most &#34;falling stars&#34;. Next was a ground based explosion(large) south of Las Animas, by the sound quite a few miles to the south. I thought this was space junk on reentry, so I called Space Command and the officer told me they did not track space junk and he really did not know of any one who did it, there would be no one to call to find out. I told him of the largeness of the 1 object, bright buring blue and bright white(may have been below cloud level, cloudy in parts tonight) and possibly impact south of Las Animas. He could have cared less and told me to call my local police. The thing that really bothered me was the explosion south and the officers excuse of no way to track it and how he could care less about the explosion(not a sonic bomb).<n>

The only thing at first that I noticed about this light was that instead of having one or more lights that blink, this was one light to slow and staying to long to be a meteor.  It was not an airplane, of that I am sure planes fly over my hous all of the time and this was definately not a plane.  After about two minutes the light just dissapeared.  I looked all over to see if it had chanced to fly behind a tree, it hadn&#39;t.  I am not prone to see things not there.  I am a very rational and scientific thinking person.  I had even delayed reporting this event for fear of being called a cook or something of the sort.

When I lift my head up and was looking towards the sky. I noticed this bright object in the air.  At firset I though it was a couple of planes. But to my surprise it was a UFO floating in the air. It looked like a mountain of diamonds brightly shinning. It was floating down. Under the bottom of the objcet it had like a black shadow. I couldn&#39;t believe my eyes.  I ran downstair to my friends house and told her to come outside and to see this UFO. By the time she came out the UFO was still there and she saw it.  It was floating down and going behind a building. I notice that it was alot of plans flying around the area. Some planes ere flying very low also their where flying in a circle.<n> <n><n> <n><n> on Sunday, December 12, 1999 at appriomately around 8:10 pm I went outside on my patio to take my mop out.  I drop some matches on the ground I bend down to pick them up. When I lift my head up and notice this bright thing in the sky. At first I thought it was a bunch of planses of something.  I looked again and I notice that it was not.  It was a bright around cirle of lights floating in the sky. The more I looked it looked like a custer of diamonds. It was bright ligths and had an oval shape on top.  and under the bottom of the round circle. It look like a black round shadow under it.  At first I could believe it.  I ran down to my firend house and  told her to come outside and to see this UFO. I told her to hurray, hurray. When she came outside we ran to the area and I pointed the UFO to her. It was floating and getting lower. As it got lower it went behind this building and we could see it again.  While all this was going on I notice all these planes flying around in a circle.  Some the planes were flying very low. some were moving very fast. The UFO was in my area of town for about 5 to 8 minutes. But the planes kept on flying around in the sky. My friend called her daughter boyfriend out of the house to show him, but by the time he came out it had dissapeared. But the planes were still circlieg around the the area. We stood out for about 40 minutes waiting to see if we could see it again.  We even went driving around to see if the could try to find the location where it may have landed. I went back upstairs and try to use my computer and it was not working right.  The next day when I went to work the computers on the job was nothing working right.  Another friend i was just talking and she mention to me that her computers on the job was down for some reason.<n>

There were three of them very close together in the shape of a triangle. But there wasn&#39;t any other stars out because it was still daylight. We both pointed them out at the same time and thought it was pretty strange to see stars out that early especially in that formation. Shortly after we spotted them they flew off in opposite directions. I have an open mind when it comes to U.F.O. sightings, but I&#39;m not saying that they were U.F.O.s because to me I didn&#39;t see a flying saucer all I saw were three star like objects in the sky but it makes me wonder exactly what it was we saw that evening.<n>

Military rocket launch|12/16/99|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/011/S11377.html|154|ndxe199912| A single small cloud moved from WNW to WSW over a 5 min. period in an otherwise clear sky. Faintly comet-shaped. Military rocket launch?<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am a computer-graphics animator with interest in weather, astronomy, space travel, etc. I watch the sky a lot, and what I saw wouldn&#39;t have raised the average person&#39;s eyebrow but I found it hard to explain. I was driving westbound on the 101 freeway at about 4:45pm on Friday, December 10. There was a very strong wind (around 30 mph) blowing out of the north. The sun had set earlier but the western sky was still bright with upward-slanting sunlight. The sky was completely cloudless (except for 2-3 cumulus clouds very far to the north end of the San Fernando Valley which were no longer lit by direct sunlight). There were a number of contrails from overflying jets (there are many major airways over the SF Valley). These all appeared as salmon and orange-colored lines of about two inches at arm&#39;s length. They didn&#39;t persist but followed close behind the jets. As I drove West through Sherman Oaks, I saw a small cloud to the WNW, a little to the right of the freeway and just above treetop level. It appeared a bit smaller than my thumbnail at arm&#39;s length. The cloud appeared to be illuminated by sunlight, but it was very fuzzy and not as dense or as detailed as a cumulus cloud. Still, it had visible volume and the side facing the sun (now hidden by the horizon) was brighter than the other side. It was not a bright orange or yellow as the nearby contrails but rather had a slight pinkish quality. It rather looked like a vaporous ball that had been smudged horizontally. I judged it to be fairly high and far away, based on the fact that it was still receiving sunlight even though all the mountains in the valley were in total shadow. It struck me as odd, being the only visible cloud in the sky, and not dispersing from winds. As I watched over a period of 5 minutes it drifted to the left of the freeway, still around treetop level and still being hit by sunlight. When I looked at the cloud with my peripheral vision it appeared to take on a cometary appearance, being pointed on the leading edge and fanning out on the trailing side. This detail wasn&#39;t as obvious with my direct vision. As time passed the cloud did seem to shrink slightly, perhaps to 3/4ths its original size. Eventually it disappeared from view, but given its path it wasn&#39;t going to pass behind any visual obstructions. I got the impression it simply stopped existing. My guess is: this was an exhaust plume from a military space launch from some facility to the north or northwest of the LA region. We&#39;ve had a number beautiful upper-atmosphere tests here in recent years and I rather expected this to be another of those launches, but I didn&#39;t observe anything more than the one cloud. The quality of the cloud&#39;s density and shape was similar to the clips I&#39;ve seen of rocket exhausts in the upper atmosphere/low orbit realm where there isn&#39;t any turbulence to speak of. If it was a rocket, then it must have been travelling westward from the launch point. That&#39;s unusual (but not unheard of) because most rockets lauch to the east to take advantage of the earth&#39;s rotational speed. If it wasn&#39;t a rocket, then I&#39;m at a loss to explain it. Are there any records of a launch on that day?<n>

By this time clouds had moved over the north group. As I watched, all the &#34;little moons&#34; moved slowly to form one larger &#34;moon&#34;.

Traveling North West above the Fashion Square Mall, Scottsdale Road and Camelback Road, where I work I looked up and through the cloud cover, which was very hazy, I saw an illuminated object which had a very odd shape, which I could hardly make out because of the clouds. It was traveling at a faster pace than a plane and the illumination and/or object seemed to be changing while it was in flight. Several odd shapes within a V and M sort of formation. The illumination was easier to see than the shape itself, it just kinda of glowed above the cloud cover. It was about the size of a harvest moon, but not that far away. It was definately in our atomosphere and above the clouds. Thankyou, maybe others saw also?<n>

HH when the object was observed at the intersection of HH and Kircher Rd.  It was triangular with very bright White and Red lights.  It hovered over the trees and then disappeared out of sight behind a hill.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My wife was taking my daughter&#39;s friend home.  They were headed East on Rt. HH (North of Columbia off of Rt.B) when my daughters&#39; friend spotted the object.  It scared my wife as she thought it was an airplane crashing into the trees.  It came from the North and crossed their path at the intersection of Kircher Rd. and Rt. HH.  My wife was scared to turn onto the gravel Rd. (Kircher) but did, as the object was immediately in front off them.  As they turned onto Kircher, the object hovered over the trees just off to their left.  It was moving sporadically.  It would hover and then move, hover and move again.  My daughter found her camera but by the time she got it ready, the object had disappeared out of sight.  My wife is not a believer in U.F.O.&#39;s but I listen to Art Bell sometimes.  Needless to say, I made fun of them all until I started to here reports all over town about this event.  The children had their windows down and the object made no noise as it hovered.  The distance was hard to judge but that is a heavily wooded area so they would had to been very close to it to been able to see it as long as they did.  They didn&#39;t want to report it for fear people would think them crazy but after hearing reports of the same exact sighting, I thought you might be interested in these facts.  My daughters&#39; friend called tonight (12-10-99) and told us that a boy in that area, witnessed the object floating over his house.  This is not a normal occurence for this area and certainly not for my wife.  My daghter has been effected by this sighting.  Her fear is that no one will believe her.  I didn&#39;t help much by making fun of them when they returned home.  I&#39;ve been all over the U.S. , Canada and even traveled abroad and have never seen anything remotely suspicious but there is no doubt that my family and friends have spotted something strange in the area.  I asked them how they couldn&#39;t make out a shape of the vehicle at such close range and they all said the lights were so bright that they couldn&#39;t see anythin! g else. They were larger than aircraft landing lights and much brighter.  My wife recalls seeing white and red as do the children.  No noise was heard.  We have gone to the University where the &#34;Flight For Life&#34; helicopter takes off and lands.  You can here it with the car windows up from a much greater distance than they could have possibly been at.  They claim that the lights are much brighter also.  Thanks for your forum.<n>

At first I thought they were from two police helicopters which were tracking the movements of a fugitive; i witnessed this in Kansas City once.  The lights certainly appeared to hover but it was obvious a few seconds later that the lights were from an aircraft which was moving westward with a slight movement to the north.  The object appeared to be a large jet liner on a final approach but that was impossible because the nearest airport here is to the southwest.  The aircraft was, in fact, moving roughly parallel to I-70.  All that I could really see was that when the aircraft was nearly on top of me it had a row of lights, 8 or 12 in all, which formed a shallow &#34;V&#34;, with the point of the &#34;V&#34; aimed in the direction of flight.  It made no sound until almost overhead, then a muffled sound of a jet engine.  Once the aircraft had passed, the jet engines were silent, but it was not the sound of a shutdown, but sort of a fast fadeout.  Its speed was about the same as propeller aircraft (200 mph).  Since I have seen and heard this aircraft before I have assumed that it is based at Whiteman Airforce Base. In light of two news items in local papers I have decided to report what I recently saw and heard, as accurately and concisely as I can.  The delta shape reported by some, including a friend who saw one of these close to Whiteman, near sundown, where he was working reminds me of the shape of the B-2 bomber, though the B-2 is delta shaped only on its leading edge,  however I speculate that for such an aircraft to fly at low speed, which Jane&#39;s reports that it can, there must be extra flaps which are necessary to improve on the aircraft&#39;s lift, flaps which have never been shown to the general public.<n>

I&#39;m assuming from my own depth perception and the amount of ground illumination striking it  that the object was about the size of a small plane and flying at about 1000 ft.above me.  I happened to glance up just as I got out of my truck in the driveway and noticed it above the roof of my neighbors house.  At first I thought it was a light colored garbage bag carried in the wind-it was blowing pretty hard-when I realized it was moving at a steep angle to the wind and in a steady, straight line.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I saw one object, approximately the same size as a small plane, pass over my neighborhood under the low cloud cover.  It was circular in shape and at least flat on the bottom.  The only illumination was reflected ground light-I live in a city of 60000-and I would estimate the object to have been about 1000&#39; up.  It moved in a steady, straight line to the NNW while the wind was wind was strong from WSW.  I was, and remain, stumped.  I have kept a close eye on the sky for over 30 years and this is the first time I saw something I can&#39;t explain, and I&#39;ve seen some interesting things.  I will try to provide more info on actual weather stats if I can track them down.<n>

There was a light underneath the craft because me and my girlfriend followed it for 4 miles down Williams road in Columbus OH, and from the beginning of the sight of seeing this object It glowed more when we was away from it and hovered for quite a while. When we was on top of it was when we seen the light underneath it, nothing like I could describe.  It left a trail, similar to a contrail, but very differant.  The other objects must have came from the mothership of something, because they had a goldish shimmer to them we seen these later on after we turned away from the white glowing object.  There was certain effects left our truck and cell phone.  Of these are.... The cell Phone ran out of energy way too quick after it was charged an hour before we left, and the truck didn&#39;t want to go in reverse after witnessing the altercation.

We then proceeded to go home about 2 1/2 miles away, I tracked them in the car, and when we got home looked at them again, they were still there, there where also alot of planes flying around, It look as though they were following the objects, but I am not sure. the last time I looked they were still there, that was at about 20:45. I do study ufo&#39;s somewhat, and believe that what I saw was not just planes, or stars.<n>

We left her house at about 6:10p.m. to 6:20p.m. on Sunday night as we were returning home to Alpharetta, Georgia (my son needed to be in bed by about 9:30p.m./ he was 9 yrs. old at the time). We had been gone from my mom&#39;s house for about 15 minutes, we turned on Shoal Creek Rd. heading towards the city square of Dawsonville. There seemed to be almost no traffic on this winding country road. As we rounded a lazy turn in the road, my son &amp; I witnessed, at VERY CLOSE range, what appearred to be a &#34;Black Triangle&#34; shaped craft. It was barely at tree top level (approximately 100 feet)directly in front of us. It was floating,kind of rocking in a bizzare manner, slowly from left to right. I can only compare this to a &#34;Puppett&#34; on a string. This object was floating, almost dancing,&amp; appeared to be turned up on its sides. The sides were un-equal in length (I think it would be classified as an &#34;Isosalyes Triangle, math teacher would be proud).Anyway, we were in a state of shock from what we were witnessing (I assumed this later that night). In each corner on underside of craft, were dark blue/neon type lights. These lights were not overly bright at this time. They seemed to be casting a blueish hue, towards the center, where we observed what I can only describe as two straight lines, one a little higher than the next,similar to the number 11 with half-square parenthesis on each side of the vertical 11 lines. The square-like parenthesis were off-set from each other, the one on the left side was higher up than the one on the right. Me or my son, either one can still draw this perfectly. It looked perhaps like some form of insignia. The craft just floated right in front of us, across the road to the other side. as soon as I intially saw this object, I swerved off the road &amp; slammed on the brakes. We were not going very fast anyway. This object was approximately 200&#39;ft. directly in front of us &amp; about 100&#39;ft high. This all! seemed so damn surreal! As this object/craft floated slowly to the other side of this road, we just sat there in my truck (Lexus RX 300) observing this obvious un-earthly vehicle. I say this because of the movement,shape, ect.. When it reached the right side of the road,(where we were sitting), the craft seemed to just &#34;blink-off&#34;. It was gone, just like somebody turned off a light switch. There was no apparent acceleration, it was literally there one minute &amp; gone the next.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At that point I pulled my truck back on the road &amp; we continued our trip home. The really strange thing was we didn&#39;t say &#34;anything&#34; to each other the rest of the way home,which took us about 30 - 35 minutes. I pulled into our driveway, opened the garage door, pulled truck into carport &amp; we just sat there staring ahead, facing the wall in the carport with the truck still running. We sat there, silently, for maybe 5 minutes, when all of sudden at the same time we both slowly turned towards each other and asked,&#34;What the heck just happened&#34;? We did not immediately talk about this. For some reason, I told my son to go inside the house &amp; draw whatever he saw. I did the same out in my truck. I went inside &amp; then we compared drawings. We then realised that we had indeed witnessed the exact same thing. This drive normally takes 45-50 minutes. However, when we got home I noticed the clock in my truck, it was 8:40p.m.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

12/5/99 17:50|Guyton|GA|Circle||Circular 2D light "thing" appears up close range out of nowhere after dark, travels to the east.|12/16/99|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/011/S11265.html|188|ndxe199912| Circular 2D light &#34;thing&#34; appears up close range out of nowhere after dark, travels to the east.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We are facing southern direction according to the map, time is 17:50 or 18:00 (5:50pm or 6:00pm) and the sun has gone down, but the sky is very clear. Out of nowhere, neither ascending nor descending, a circular &#34;thing&#34; appears - it simply just appeared. In appearance, the &#34;thing&#34; has the gray/white color that lightning has, and it appears as if to be glowing in an electric manner whereas the edges are very jagged and leave the same impression and feeling that electric sparks do although this has no variation in color but for gray/white colors. As far as the contours and shapes go, there is no shadow or light falling on the &#34;thing&#34; itself, so it does not look three-dimensional. Instead, it is a &#34;flat&#34; two-dimensional, yet perfectly circular, &#34;thing&#34; that appears right in front of our eyes at an unapproximated distance. However, an approximated, yet unqualified, guess is that it is is 20 seconds at 45mph down the road. Its altitude can only be estimated from seeing it by the top of the highest pinetree in the pinetree-horizon. It does not do justice, though, becauseits size is much greater and very hard to estimate. Looking at it, its radius would be approximately 1/4 inches measured by the eye, which is corrected by contact lenses that were in at the moment. For the record, I see an optician every six months. The &#34;thing&#34; traveled in a very controlled line to the east without leaving a tail of light, smoke, or other trace after itself. It did not move in anything such as a sinusoidal wave and it was neither ascending ! nor descending. It was simply a straight line to the east - not coming from the west, but appearing in a spot that would make a straight line between my eyes and the &#34;thing.&#34; As the grande finale, it quickly disappeared around the house-corner after being observerved for less than 1 second. I ran around the corner but saw nothing, then to the front of the building, but saw nothing there either. Note that although it was not near the building, it was at such as angle that it disappeared &#34;around the corner.&#34; Final notes from the characteristics checkboxes: The aura or haze around the object only apply if the whole thing is considered a &#34;solid jagged glow&#34; as described above. It left no trail, it had no lights (it were a huge light itself). It emitted no objects or beams. It never changed color, landed, or made a sound. No other aircraft was spotted, and no electrical or magnetic effects were experienced - we were standing outside in the grass with no electrical dependencies around.<n>

I had just glance away from that direction, when a green flash caught my eye. I turned in the original direction and saw a green fireball with a tail, like a comet&#39;s.  I would say it was not more than 1/4 mile from me. It was not real large, I probably could have covered it with my thumb at arm&#39;s length. It was approxiamtely 100 to 150 feet in the air when I first noticed it.  I lost site of it seconds later as it went below the roofline of a hotel in front of me.  I listened for a impact, thinking it had to hit the ground, but heard nothing.  I called two hotels that faced the direction of the fireball, but neither saw or heard anything.  The fireball did not make a sound as it fell.  I don&#39;t know where it came from, it just suddenly appeared in my vision.  I immediately went in and wrote the basics of what I saw down.  Beyond this there is no more to add.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Mr. Davenport,<n> <n><n> As I was standing looking south to southwest, the object was coming<n> <n><n> from my right to my left. athough during the time I saw it, about 5 to<n> <n><n> 10 seconds it didn&#39;t appear to go very far.  It didn&#39;t shoot across the<n> <n><n> whole sky, but seemed to appear and then drop out of my sight in the<n> <n><n> same area of sky.  The tail came off the object at a 30 to 45 degree<n> <n><n> angle.  The object seemed to be falling slowly, I believe this is so<n> <n><n> because I had time to start seeing the object out of the corner of my<n> <n><n> eye (at which time it didn&#39;t appear to be to high off the ground) turn<n> <n><n> my head and focus on the object before it fell out of view.<n> <n><n> Our local news reported it as a &#34;exploding meteor&#34;.   They also said<n> <n><n> that the object was seen as far as Alabama.  That strikes me as not<n> <n><n> possible, but you&#39;d know better than I.  They apparently got calls all<n> <n><n> day long about the object.  Also our local airport, McGhee Tyson<n> <n><n> received calls about it.<n> <n><n> Should out local paper have an article on it in tomorrow&#39;s paper I&#39;ll<n> <n><n> forward that you.<n> <n><n> Sincerely<n> <n><n> <n><n> Mr Davenport,<n> <n><n> I posted a report to your page earlier this morning, Green Fireball in<n> <n><n> Knoxville, TN.  My name is ((name deleted)).<n> <n><n> I saw a news report after I filled out your form.  They said they had<n> <n><n> received numerous calls about a green fireball in the sky over Blount<n> <n><n> County, just south of Knox County.  Apparently I was wrong on how far it<n> <n><n> was from me, although it looked that close.  The local news is reporting<n> <n><n> as a (yep you guessed it) meteor.<n> <n><n> This is my first siting of something like this, now I understand your<n> <n><n> cynicism about the news media.  I&#39;ve seen meteor storms and such, never<n> <n><n> have I seen a green one.<n> <n><n> I apologize if my report may be a little inaccurate, especially on the<n> <n><n> distance I thought it was from me, but it did look that close.<n> <n><n> Sincerely,<n> <n><n> ((name deleted))<n>
12/5/99 05:05|Dalton|GA|Circle|15 Seconds?|A bright yellow object traveling from west to east, ending in a bright flash|12/16/99|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/011/S11402.html|191|ndxe199912| A bright yellow object traveling from west to east, ending in a bright flash<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was traveling south on a residential street, when out of the corner of my eye I saw a yellow &#34;ball&#34;.  The object was circular with a lime-green &#34;corona&#34;(I guess you&#39;d call it).  It sort of resembled a fire ball, yellow center with the lime-green surrounding it and a very short green tail. At first I thought I was just seeing a street light or some kind of reflection, so I did a double-take.  When I looked back, I could clearly see that it wasn&#39;t a street light, but rather something that was definately air-born.  It traveled directly from west to east, decending at approximately a 45 degree angle to the ground. I only saw the object for a few seconds, and then it just seemed to disappear with an extremely bright flash.  At the time it disappeared, I thought that it must have been a crash of some kind due to the flash.  It appeared to be about 5 miles south of my location and the diameter was about the same as the length of a Boeing 727 at 5 miles. Since it appeared to be so close, I drove to a nearby ridge which was about 3 mile SSE of my location.  From that vantage point, I had an unobstructed view of over 15 miles in all directions.  I saw nothing of a plane crash or and king of brush fire that I would expect from a meteorite of that size.(The color also ruled out a meteorite to me because every comet or meteorite I have ever seen is either white or a whitish-blue color. I didn&#39;t really give it much thought until later that morning when I was traveling with my father and happened to mention the experience to him.  We both had a good laugh and chalked it up to lack of sleep and went on discussing other matters.  About 15 minutes later, there was a newsbrief from an Atlanta radio station which said that several people, most notably a couple of Atlanta firemen, had reported seeing a strange light in the sky a little after 5 that morning.  They were just getting off work and heading home to Ellijay, which means they were traveling north when they saw it. If we all saw the same thing, it must have been larger, brighter, and further south than I had first thought. Later that night, the TV news said that the National Weather Service in Atlanta said that what the firemen saw was a meteor.  That was the last I heard of the incident. I am in my late twenties, have a college degree, and run my own business.  I have always had a real love for aviation, especially military aircraft.  I have family members that have made careers in the military, and through those connections have learned alot about the aircraft we are currently flying.  On several occasions I have tried to discuss those that don&#39;t officially exist, such as the projects profiled in periodicals such as Janes Defence, usually getting responses like, &#34;Now where did you read that?&#34;, or more often, &#34;Sometimes truth is stranger than fiction.&#34; I have personally witnessed F15s, F16a, F4s, A10s, B1-Bs, F117s, B2s, and even F22s(which is being developed at Lockeed in Atlanta) in flight both during daylight and at night. All I can tell you is that whatever it was I saw that morning was nothing I have ever seen before.  That&#39;s not to say it wasn&#39;t ours -- but it it was ours it&#39;s nothing that has ever been publicly acknowledged or even speculated on in any military or aviation journal I&#39;ve ever read. It was truly a UFO -- an Unidentified Flying Object. I found your website after seeking information on this subject and debated whether or not to tell my seemingly insignificant story.  But here I am nearly two weeks later, and what I saw is still as vivid in my mind as it was that morning.  What bothers me is that I just haven&#39;t heard any more concerning the incident, and the Nt&#39;l Weather Service&#39;s explaination of a &#34;meteorite&#34; just doesn&#39;t wash. I ask that my name or personal information not be revealed, I seek no notariety, I just hope that I can make some small contribution toward solving this puzzle.<n>

I a|12/16/99|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/011/S11268.html|193|ndxe199912| 4:30 AM Sunday morning December 5, 1999.  I witnessed a light that lit up my entire back yard and then an explosion sound followed. I also witnessed what I and 3 other people consider to be a UFO. It was visable for over an hour.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At approximately 4:30 Sunday morning, December 5, 1999, I woke up from falling asleep on the couch.  I proceeded to bed and when I did I woke up my wife to ask her to move over, she then sat up and questioned me about the time.  Before I could climb into bed a bright light like I have never seen before lit up my back yard.  The light the proceeded to slowly climb up both of my windows at the same time climbing up them at a slow pace.  The light illlumated my entire house as if it were day.  Just as the light came it went, with the darkness came up the windows in the same fashion.  We estimate the light lasted around ten to fifteen seconds.  I then ran outside where I saw nothing at all.  I do have a clear view of each horizon.  I live on about a five hundred acre farm.  As I walked back inside an explosion sound rattle the house such as an earthquake might.  At this point I was completely in shock and had no idea what was going on.  I then ran back outside and this time I noticed an object in the sky in which I had never seen before.  This object appeared to be in a saucer/disk shape.  I estimate it was about one thousand feet away.  The object appeared to be hovering over the mountain behind my house.  It came across as slowly drifting around and sometimes with great burts of speed.  One thing that stands out is that the object appeared to be circular with spotlights all the way around it.It would shine just like a lighthouse.  Myself, my wife, her father and her grandmother all witnessed this event.  We believed that it might have been a planet but as we blocked it out with a tree we noticed that it moved on both sides of the tree.  It moved with great distance.  It was in the southeastern sky.  We watched this object for over an hour and half.  I have no explanation for this nor the light.  But most of Shelby County reported to 911 seeing the lights in the sky and hearing and feeling the &#34;sonic boom&#34; as some people call it.  Though it has been on the news, many reports are conflicting and many peopl! e and ra dio stations are calling this event a coverup.  The news is reporting that a meteor, a very large meteor came through and made the night time day.  I know what a meteor is.  I have seen several come through the Earth&#39;s atmosphere and burn up.  If this was a meteor then it was one that had to be as large as a car.  Though that still does not explain what the four of us witnessed for over and hour. I hope that you can help shed some light on this.  Maybe you can help me understand why there are so many meteor sightings lately all across the U.S. Is there something that we should know that the government is not telling?  Please call or email me back with any questions that you may have!  Thanks for your time.<n>

No one had been drinking as booze is not allowed at these types of events. I was driving my car with three passengers and myself down a wooded two lane road.  I was tired as it was late that night and I pulled over into a church parkinglot to allow my friend brandon to finish the rest of the drive back.  As I approached the passanger side car door, the sky lit up as if daylight, it was the most beautiful color blue I&#39;d ever seen, almost as if the sun were beneath my feet shining a spot of light on the sky overhead and in an intant it was gone back to black.  As I turned my head back to the west I saw what looked like a black square with sparks shooting off from in front of it, flying at an unbleivable speed and dissapeard over the treeline in about another 2 seconds.  The sparks looked exactly like what you would imagine a childs sparkler on new years would look like all around the black box.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It wasn&#39;t until last weekend when the unusual event came up again in conversation that I figured I&#39;d see if I could find any info on it.

This is another object that I could not figure out It was not Military, Commercial, Helocopter, Blimp, Bird, Weather Balloon, or any known Earth made object. Just a disk/Star like flying object.<n>

This sequence of maneuvers took a matter of seconds before the UFO streaked off out of sight covering a distance of miles in only a second.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I knew in my heart of hearts right then, that this wasn’t any old weather balloon, Venus or reflections from birds but something much more extravagant and technologically sophisticated altogether.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was an incredible sight to take in and left me with no doubt that I had just observed a technologically advanced object that not only defied our laws of physics but was also most certainly under some form of intelligent control.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This entire set of maneuvers took place very quickly and the entire sighting, from first noticing the UFO to its departure was over the period of no more than two minutes. After saying goodnight to my friend, I then began to head for home.  What I had just witnessed was truly, invigoratingly mind-blowing.  This was and could only be visual confirmation of proof of life.  As the clarity of this set in, I was still completely unprepared for what was still to come, only minutes later...for at 5am on my return home, I experienced a second closer range sighting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This second sighting was observed shortly afterwards while I was returning home.  I had been in a hurry to get back to tell my brother what had happened when I spotted another similar UFO which appeared to hovering stationary over the engineering plant very close by on Newlands Road.  The object itself was much closer than my just sighting prior to this and was only several hundred feet away and at a height of no more that 200 to 250ft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Upon spotting it, I rushed down the street with the sole intention of reaching the house.  I panicked my brother when I burst the door open and yelled for everyone to get outside.  The UFO then began to display various bright light patterns for a moment or two before it grew a bright blinding light which surrounded the craft.  The light then seemed to implode and the UFO was no longer there anymore.  It had simply vanished.  It was a remarkable sight to take in and completely inexplicable.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Reeling after these events, I then telephoned two police stations to inquire if anyone had reported seeing these objects.  I did so out of curiosity in the hope that someone else may have also reported them and was informed that no one had reported anything to either station.<n> <n><n> <n><n> One hour later another UFO sighting was reported to have been observed on the West Coast of America.  The similarity in terms of the movement of this object compared with my sighting is blatantly obvious.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Corralitos, California -8hrs= 22.00 local time<n> <n><n> <n><n> http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/011/S11248.html<n> <n><n> <n><n> an audio description of these events is available on my you tube channel<n> <n><n> <n><n> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rTINrObufks<n> <n><n> <n><n> I ALSO EXPERIENCED SEVERAL OTHER SIGHTINGS ON THE 10TH 11TH, 14TH, 15TH AND 25TH December 1999 and will upload the info to NUFORC site.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thanks to Peter Davenport  *****note to Peter*********  I have info that i wish to share regarding my investigation.

I lost visual after I made the turn north towards Lordsburg.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had been driving West on I-10 in a rented U-hall truck in clear weather on a sunny day when I notice an object to my left which seemed to be traveling at the same speed, 60 mph, I had been traveling.  I know it sound strange but it seemed to be purposely following my vehicle at a distance of about a half mile on my left, at times I was the only vehicle on the road.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first I thought it was a silver weather balloon as it seemed to float, however, it continued at a constant height less than 1,000 feet above ground.

At first I though they were airplane search lights or something like that but the more I watched the more puzzling they became. These lights would stay within the cloud, one circling the whole perimeter of the cloud and the other one back and forth and occasionaly crisscrossing.  Sometimes they appeared to be inside of the cloud and that is why I do not think they were airport lights.  I decided to vidio tape them but due to the city lights around I was not sure I was recording them.   I did get maybe a couple of minutes before I stopped recording and left for work.  They just appeared very unusual to me and wondered and maybe anything like this has ever been reported.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

They hung around for about four hours, and military planes flew over.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Around 7:30pm on Dec. 03, 1999, my cousin (who at the time was 10 years old) and I went outside to wait for Santa Claus to come by on his firetruck (a town Christmas tradition). I need to give you a quick description of where we live.  We live on the West side of Lodi, our house faced north but to the west of us across the street is nothing but fields going towards the delta.  The only houses around us are to the east and north.  As we were outside waiting I happened to turn to the west towards the field and noticed two large orange/red fireballs hanging over the field just a little above tree level.  I had my cousin go in the house and get three more of my relatives.  As we watched these lights they would appear and disappear as if throwing alight switch, and sometimes they would just get real dim then glow real brightly.  Around this time four more of my relatives were driving by so we flagged them down to watch.  There were other motorists on the road, and some looked like they were looking at the objects, but I&#39;m not sure if any one else saw them.  Anyways, this whold thing lasted about four and a half hours of these huge fireballs appearing, disappearing, dimming, and darting back and forth. And the entire time aircraft was circling them, I mean lots and lots of airplanes.  AT one point a huge military plane flew right over our house and it was so low you could see the missles attached to it. One of the unknown craft went flying down the field, just barely over the grapevinyards, and it seemed to be spinning as it flew.  It had red and blue lights andit was so fast we couldn&#39;t even tell where it went.  So to make a long story short Lodi was full of strange lights that night and after that night we saw them around five or six more times.<n>

The streak lasted some 1/2 second and by holding out hand it was about the size of my thumb nail.  I noticed it was above the thin layer of cirrus clouds. It was too big to be a shooting star.  The sky was still blue and the sun was still in the sky.  I was amazed by how bright the object was inthe daytime sky.  It was moving faster than anythng I had seen before including shooting stars.  The object came from behind me out of the southeast and traveled toward the northeast.  Without dissapating, the object just disapeared.  No jerking movment or obvious change of direction was observed.  I couldn&#39;t tell if it had a tail of if I was observing the visual stretch of the object due to the speed.  I don&#39;t think this was space junk because of the size of the solid part of the object.<n>

I seemed to be having a strange dream.  In the dream I was back in the house I grew up in.  I was in my bedroom.  What was odd about this so called dream, was that this bedroom didn&#39;t look at all like my bedroom.  The furniture was not like bedroom furniture, it was more hospital-like.  A person came in the room that appeared to look like my sister.  We had conversation, then she left the room.  Another person that looked like my mother came into the room.  We also had conversation. I was told that I was tired and I needed to take a nap.  I was told to go lay on my bed.  When I approached the bed, I noticed it looked like a hospital bed.  I remember thinking if this is supposed to be a dream, why am I seeing this.  I took a closer look at this bed and I noted a table to the right of the bed.  On top of the table was some sort of rectangular device that was beige in color.  There were wires coming out of the side of this box that connected to the bed.  At the back of the box there were wires that went into the wall.  I took my left hand and touched the bed.  I could feel some sort of low electric current.  I new something was very wrong here.  My first instinct was to run.  I turned around and ran out of this room.  To my left was a rampway.  I ran down this rampway and around to the front of this sort of building. When I had taken to run , I heard someone say &#34;Uh-Oh&#34;.  I turned around to see if anyone was following me. I saw a man in a light blue spandex looking outfit. I went to run, to the right of me was, a person that looked like my deceased grandmother. She said &#34;take me instead&#34; at that point I realized I was not dreaming, I had become fully awake. I feel as if I went into shock, My heart was beating so fast and I was shaking, I looked down, I had on the pajamas I had worn to bed and I was in my bare-feet. I couldn&#39;t believe that this was happening to me. It would be very hard for me to descibe the place because it was so unreal. As I was t! rying to run from this man chasing me, I looked ahead and there was another, he was leading a woman that appeared to be drugged. I felt I had nowhere to run, so I turned and faced my pursuer, he had his arm reached out to grab me. To avoid any bad repurcussions I placed my hand in his hand. When I looked at the face of this man his eyes were covvered with some sort of visor but I could tell this man was not fully human, when I placed my hand in his hand he had a strange grin on his face, he then placed my hand on his groin area. The feeling I had was as if I was cattle, I was lead over to what looked like an orange van and I noticed the van had no wheels. The back passenger door slide open as I was being put into the van I remember praying out loud but could only repeat the same line over and over again &#34;Our Father who art in heaven&#34;. Inside the van were what appeared to be three children around the age of twelve and they said to me &#34;We worship too.&#34; I noticed the childrens&#39; mouth weren&#39;t moving. I was sitting in the van opposite the children, the two beings in the blue got into the front compartment of the van, I could see into the front compartment because there was a glass partition above the seat I was sitting in. I noticed a control panel running along the front of the van interior, then I turned to look at the three children, they were just watching me. I said to the children &#34; aren&#39;t you afraid?&#34; and the said &#34; no, this has been happening all our lives.&#34;. I had then noticed the van had started acsending vertically. I looked at the children and I asked if we were from the same planet and they replied &#34;yes&#34;. What struck me funny was that I was looking out the window and It was beautiful looking at the lights of what appeared to be a city. These children were just watching me. At some point I remember asking &#34;Why is this happening to me?&#34; and &#34;There is no God, otherwise he wouldn&#39;t let this happen to me..&#34;. I became very angry and I turned and started banging on the glass partition. I felt something on the l! ower bac k section of my skull and lost conciousness. The next thing I remember is being lead to a room by my initial pursuer, we were standing outside the doorway of a room, when I looked in the room I saw appoximately fifteen people casually talking, they were all dressed in white. The being that was holding my hand started speaking to a man in the room to the right. The man in the room said to him &#34;I&#39;m not a telepath, you&#39;ll have to talk&#34; at some point I heard GH3 and also the man&#39;s name which I will withhold at this time. The man to the right said &#34; I&#39;ll tell them your ready&#34; at this point I lose conciousness again. When I awake I am in this orange-red lite room. I will keep this less graphic as possible. It was a none human on top of me and I felt as if my upper arms were restrained, I reached up and touched the face it was definately not human skin, I looked to my right and could see where the red light was eminating from, there was a run of lights pulsating the orange-red color. This lighting made it rather dificult to make out things in the room clearly. The being on top of me was making a strange none human type of noise that sounded almost like a lion purring but faster. I looked to my left there were other exam tables and a person lying on it and the same was happening to this person as was happening to me. I tried to fight this but was totally helpless. I lost conciousness again. I came to in my bedroom with excruitiaing pain in my lower abdomin, I looked at my clock, it was 4:01am. I triede to get out of my bed, it was very hard I felt drugged, I started to cry and scream at the same time. I have three older children in my house that are very light sleepers. I sat on my floor crying and screaming for a good ten minutes. Not one of them heard a thing at 4:01 but one of them at around 2:20am heard a commotion in my bedroom but went to sleep. When I went to use the bathroom I had found physical evidence that something had happened to me. 1 1/2 later the mans name that I heard in the white room to the ri! ght I fo und on the Internet, I pulled up at picture of him and it was the same man. This man is known in the U.F.O. community. Whether or not this is the actual man, I don&#39;t know, if the can make me think I am seeing my mother, sister and grandmother then they could also make me see someone else whom I&#39;ve never met.<n>

At first I thought is was an airplane since I don&#39;t live that far from Sea-Tac airport, but when I noticed it had no beacon lights of any kind it caught my attention. It was not very bright, in fact it was so dim I was amazed i even noticed it. It was at an angle of about 50 - 60 degrees off the horizon, heading in a southern direction, moving about the speed of a small airplane. It was maybe about the size of my thumb at arms legnth. It was a fairly clear night, not a lot of wind, no meteors. I heard no sound (even though I was inside, an airplane that close would make a noticeable sound). I dont know of any aricraft that are circular, so I&#39;m stumped.<n>

When I looked over i saf a craft, small, at high altitude with one moderatly bright, blueish light in front, and a smaller, dimmer redish light in back.  as it flew over, most likely very high speed given the approximate altitude and duration, gave out low sounds, almost like the sounds whales make when signing, or like the sound that metal makes under high stress, like in a ship&#39;s hull, when bending.  As it flew over the horizon i heard these sounds, maybe 3 or 4 times in slow succession. The night was cold (35* F.) and clear, with light whispy clouds in the SSE direction.  The craft was flying ESE and I could see it from the time it came over the horizon, to the time The trees in the backround obstructed it.<n>

There was a bright body, perhaps Jupiter just above when I first saw them. They sort of circled eachother moving apart and back together while flying south. I lost sight of them due to a street light in by line of sight. I pointed out the location to one other person at the bus stop who also say them as lights and not birds as was my first impression. The sky was clear and dark.<n>

I do not make any conclusions about things until I have reviewed them as thoroughly as possible.  This incident was particularly unnerving, though.  I was driving home from shopping at an all night supermarket and noticed some very bright lights ahead about the height and intensity of stadium lights.  That location did not have any such lights so I presumed some may have been added.  The night was very dark - I don&#39;t recall if it were overcast or just dark, but I could not see anything but this panel of lights in the distance.  As I neared the lights, which were just barely to my left and very high I looked out my window and tried to see them better.  When I looked up it seemed as if I were looking at the bottom of something, but I couldn&#39;t tell because it was so dark.  I could not even make out a shape; I only could see this row of lights and darkness behind them.  I drove by very slowly with the window down.  No noise and no movement came from it.  I decided to come back the next day to see why/where lights had been erected.  I drove to my home in the town up the road.  As I drove up the cross street to my street I was shocked to see these same lights moving very slowly up my street, perpendicular to my car.  They were about 20 feet in the air; they clearly were not on the ground.  I stopped the car, opened the window and turned off the car lights and engine.  I watched these strange lights go to the end of my street, across the street I was on, and continue over the field on the other side.  The object produced no sound at all the entire time I watched it.  I was totally spooked by this time and drove into my garage as quickly as I could.  The next day I went back to where I thought lights had been erected and found nothing but an empty field with a few trees.  Strangely enough, three months later I came down with cancer.  Years later I was watching a UFO report where an entire town sited a UFO.  They cont! acted a nearby air traffic controller who could not see the UFO on radar, but could see it with his naked eyes.  The description the controller gave of the lights and the representative drawing showing the orientation of the lights were identical to what I saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.

It moved spinning its backwards directed narrow end.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Just the day after lunar eclipse of december 1999. Weather clear. I was adjusting a portable telescope(some 5&#34;diam.)on the terrace of my 3rd floor apartment, and focused it to the moon, that was rising to approximetely 30 deg. As soon as I located the left inferior arc of the satellite, my attention was attracted to a black, tiny pear or tear shaped object that moved in &#34;front&#34; of it with a peculiar balancing spinning straight displacement that mantained the narrow end backwards. This lasted a blur. Assuming the image was inverted, the actual direction would be an ascending 45 deg. right to left as seen against the brightness of the moon. I was motivated to submitt this observation after reading the report cited from NUFORC by George A. Filer in Filer,s Files #31,8-8-00, that occured in Bronx, N.Y.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Individual who submitted report has professional credentials, and is an experienced amateur astronomer.

We were looking due north. What was unusual was that the meteor fell straight down. The streak the meteor left was exactly vertical. Seems very unusual to have an exact vertical meteor streak.<n> <n><n> <n><n> While driving north on Interstate 15 in San Bernadino County, California, me and a business associate both saw a meteor fall due north of us. The path did not reach the ground. What was very odd was that the path left by the falling meteor was exactly vertical. That seems very odd to me. The earth and the meteor would have to be travelling exactly towards each other for it to streak perfectly vertical. It is even more odd considering I saw another vertical meteor 1 week before this while travelling home from thanksgiving dinner. That night I was travelling due west and saw a meteor leave a streak due west from my location. I was just entering the Hemet area where a large valley occurs. The meteor streak appeared over the San Jacinto mountains west of hemet. The streak was again exactly vertical. It was almost as if a star just fell straight down out of the sky. A very odd sight. These two meteors are the only ones I recall seeing in the past 20 years and both left exatcly vertical up down paths. Seems very wierd to me.<n>

They seemed to be 1000&#39;s of feet above us and moving quite fast. The very weird thing was that they oscillated rapidly in a lateral direction while moving.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My girlfriend and I stepped off of our front porch in downtown Madison, circa December 1999. Looking straight up to see the stars, as I am wont to do, I noticed three lights in a triangular formation moving very rapidly to the South. The lights were about as bright as stars and seemed to be very high in the sky. From the time I noticed them until the time they left the horizon it was, at most, 10 seconds. The thing that was very bizarre was that all three of the lights oscillated or &#34;jiggled&#34; very rapidly in a lateral direction as they flew.<n>

Everyone, (two others), got up to look, then we all ran into the back yard.  It passed very close to us, maybe 80 to 100 feet high and 300 feet away. It was quite large, 55 to 100 feet long.  It moved very slowly, maybe 15 mph, allowing us a good view of the underside of the craft. There was no discernable sound. We all described the same shaped object with only a few differences. I saw a triangle with two &#34;headlights&#34; positioned about a third of the way back on each side, round white lights on each tip of the triangle and a red light in the center.  The other two witnesses saw a triangle with a yellowish light in the center and flashing red lights around the perimeter of the craft. I lost sight of it as it moved east because I went into the house to get fourth witness. When I returned with the fourth witness the craft was already in a turn and heading southeast. He and I described the object identically, however, as it was turning I saw a bright white light drop from its right side. I did not see where the second object (light) went. The fourth witness ran into the house and dialed 911. That call was received ao 10:01P/CST. We refrred to NUFORC. (Uploaded by investigator. Note: It has been suggested that the witnesses saw a DC9 on a routine nightly flight. There is a flight that arrives at Columbia Regional Airport between 10:00 and 10:15P/CST and leaves at approximately 10:35. But airport director, Bill Boston, said that this flight would probably not be in the area of this sighting. Also at approximately 9:45P, December 1, 1999, another witness sighted a triangular shaped craft flying north over Highway 63. Each witness of these separate events drew the same type craft complete with &#34;headlights&#34;.)<n>

The craft was a triangular object that had 3 very bright lights It had 1 light on each corner of the triangle.The lights were a bright white or yellow.It also had a circular object in the center of the triangle,it looked to be a window or door of some kind.Possibly even another light that was not illuminated.The craft also had 2 rods or poles that protruded out of the front of the craft.They also seemed to be lights,but also were not illuminated.The craft was approximately 60-70 ft.long.We saw this craft just on the south-east side of Columbia,MO at about 9:45pm on dec. 1,1999.<n>

Point of triangle facing direction of travel. One red light in center of triangle.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Triangle Two: Same as first triangle except it had a cluster of blue lights instead of one red light. Blue lights seemed to be scattered throughout a spherical area in the center of the triangle. The blue lights repeatedly flashed in the same &#34;seemingly random&#34; sequence with a momentary hesitation between cycles. Length of cycle was about two seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Distance between triangles was about the width of the moon. All lights remained in ridged formation which never varied. No physical structure or &#34;craft&#34;  connecting the lights was visible and no stars were obscured.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Elevation was approximately thirty degrees.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A faint engine noise could be heard. Two other people in separate houses under the apparent path of the lights reported hearing a rumbling sound from something passing overhead.<n> <n><n> <n><n> While standing in a street in Grandview, WA, the lights was first seen to the north traveling east. Over the next five minutes they traveled one complete circle around the town until reaching the point where first sighted. Apparent radius of route was maybe three miles. The lights then traveled north east toward the Hanford Nuclear Reservation until out of sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>
