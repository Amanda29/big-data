The light was very bright, and far too big to be a star. I stopped and looked at this light, which seemed to be getting bigger. As the light got closer, I could see several other lights surrounding what appeared to be a triangle. There was no noise,the craft was all black, apart from the smaller lights that went aound the edges. The craft went silently overhead, and headed off in a north east direction.<n>

It caught our attention because it was flashing red and bright white lights in a rotating pattern.It was stationary in the sky for about fifteen minutes and then we noticed small flashes of light some distance away; these lights were of jets. We actually witnessed a jet fly near the object and then retreat.A short time later (two/three minutes)we saw five other jets scoping out the area. The UFO then began movely extremely slowly up and down, bobbing in the sky. The jets all moved out very quickly, and the UFO slowly disappeared into the night.<n>

First occured Monday Aug 28 at 21:15 local time. Second sighting was Aug 30 at 21:10 local time. Both were exactly the same. From my position in west central Ohio, a bright light appreared approx 35 degrees from horizon due north. Light appreared from pin point to become a very bright light. Brighter than any star visible. The light lasted for approx 30-40 seconds the faded away to a pin point, then vanished. On Monday the 28th I noted it, and thought hard about making a report. The second sighting on the 30th convinced me this was not any type of aircraft or natural phenonmenon. I am a 42 year old male. Married. Own my own home. Currently employed full time, and with my current job 10 years. I have eight years active duty in the US Coast Guard as a Quartermaster (navigator) and have been trained to make true and keen observations. In 42 years I have never seen anything that remotely resembles this.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We do not know what it was the witness observed.  However, a regular reader of our posted reports has cited the fact that an Iridium was scheduled to &#34;flare&#34; ( Magnitude:  -3) in the northern sky, as viewed from Troy, at 31 degrees above the horizontal plane, at 2109 hrs., on this date.  The description is not entirely consistent with a sighting of an Iridium satellite, but we cite the coincidence of the two events.  Our thanks to Lexy.  PD))<n>

On the horizon, in front of us and just to the right of the airport runway we noticed a bright light in the sky.  My boyfriend and I thought that a large plane was coming in for a landing.  This bright light which looked to be about two to three miles away remained in the same position in the sky.  The light did not get closer or move away.  It just hovered there.  I drove faster trying to get closer to this object in the sky and then it disappeared.  In both of our minds, this was not a plane, or a balloon, or a satelite, or a helicopter.  The light was brighter than the landing lights of a jet or helicopter. In both of our minds this was certainly an unidentified object.<n>

At about 1.30 am I was suddenly awoken by a bright white light that only lasted a second, rather like the flash of lightening.  I lay in bed listening for the thunder to follow but this did not happen.  Within a minute there was another flash of white followed closely by a third.  Now I could have been dreaming the first but I was wide awake by now so the second and third were not my imagination.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Wanting to visit the bathroom at this point I went through to the en-suite bathroom which has a skylight and looking through the glass I saw that the stars were out and there was some cloud also.  In the distance quite high up I saw 4 circular shapes and as I looked they all moved together into the centre to form one circle of light, then moved out to become four again.  This happened repeatedly.  I thought that perhaps there was a reflection on the glass of the skylight so I opened it to look directly at the sky but the circular shapes were still there and doing the same thing.  Moving into the centre, becoming one shape then moving out again to become four.  The lights were not bright and glaring but more a dull &#34;white&#34;.  I stood and watched this for maybe 15 minutes then went to bed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Next morning I questioned my friends to ask if they had seen the white flashes but they had not.  We then checked to see if any reports had come through on the radio or later in the newspapers, again nothing had been reported.  In an effort to explain logically what I had seen we wondered if the lights had come from EXPO ie maybe laser lights but EXPO does not run that late into the morning and the distance was too far away.  There is a radio mast not far away which is lit up at night and I wondered if this had somehow caused the lights but the size of the lights made this explanation unlikely.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Regarding the television programme the other evening about UFO&#39;s, there was extensive coverage on the different sightings over the years including video footage of what people had seen.  The commentator then said &#34;In Germany there has frequently been reported that circular shapes have been seen&#34; and they showed examples identical to what I have just described.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Over to you?

I directed their attention to the object...it was very very high and moving across the sky at a speed appearing to be consistant with that of a satellite, which we know to be around 18,0000 mph. We observed this object for 2 or 3 minutes until a very unusual thing happened...it appeared to suddenly stop dead in its tracks and then remained basically stationary in the same position for approximately 10 more minutes. It gradually faded from sight, perhaps moving directly away from us and fading with distance. There is no satellite that I know of that can come to a sudden stop. Far far too high for any helicopter. I was a helicopter avionics mechanic in Viet Nam so I know that it was nothing of that nature. When it happened, We all exclaimed at the same time...It just stopped!<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We agree that it is very unusual for a satellite to stop.  We do not know what the witnesses could have observed.  PD))<n>

The visible size from the observation point was a glowing orb shaped craft of 1 to 1.5 cm diameter. It appeared as a circular fireball without a tail nor corona. The craft seemed to disintigrate in the atmosphere rather than disapear, although the craft did not change shape. The height above gound and the arc being traversed suggested it would crash into the ground, had it not disintegrated. After this sighting, both my 18 year old son (who did not see the event, and myself started to experience body somatics, itchiness and aching in the joints. I experienced some minor pain in my eyes,and some slight nausea. Going outside the house tended to increase itchiness. This suggested there was an accident where the craft was destroyed in the atmosphere emitting low level eltero magnetic radiation.<n>

I was sitting watching TV when I suddenly noticed a bright light in the sky  that oscillated back and forth. It was way up there (30,000 feet?) and very luminous like a star, but it moved noticeably left and right while the other stars stayed put. When I put my scope (8 inch) on it, it became clear that this object was something strange. It consisted of orange globes of light that formed lines between themselves and connected themselves to each other by these lights.  The lines of light  moved around erratically as the globes themselves changed colors. The object was slowly moving and changing shape over and over again as it just moved around up there in the sky.  At one point it definitely looked like a saucer, with a puslating light underneath and a series of colored lights running acorss its middle. At another point it looked like the bottom of a guitar with yellow, glowing lines running acrosss its bottom. The whole experience left me feelig extremely worried: it literally seemed out of this world to me, that is, like nothing I have ever seen before and like nothing that I currently have the resources to understand. I am very eager to know if anyone else has seen this object last night in the Oregon skies. Please leave a posting if you have. I want to know that this thing was.<n>

Whne I did I saw a bright light almost directly overhead but it was moving at a very fast speed. I said to my wife look at that light it us really moving quickly. Since it was dark out it was difficult to determine its altittude but I would say it was extremely high up (maybe 50,000 ft or so). It traveled almost in a straight line moving west to east-southeast. The light was steady &amp; did not flash as an airplane would. There wasn&#39;t any noise accompanying the movement. The sighting lasted approx. 20-30 seconds &amp; the light dis-appeared as it moved towards the horizon/tree line of my neighborhood. My wife &amp; I have seen many airplanes in our lifetime, but I can assure you that this was not any plane I have ever seen.. Maybe some type of secret millitary craft.. but certainly not a commercial craft..<n>

We said that it was a jet and my grandson said that no it was not, that it was taking its tail with it.  We looked again.  It was moving horizontally very fast across the sky with no jet noise.  It was luminous, yellowish and very bright.  It was roundish in the front and then had like a long tail coming off and tapering down to very small.  Kind of like a sperm shape.  It looked like one thing and never changed its length or shape.  Where it tapered I could see waves of energy moving in it.  It was very beautiful looking.  It appeared out of nowhere in the east and moved across the sky under the sun to the west and then went down behind the mountains.  On 8-28-00 on the way to Calistoga my husband and I saw what appeared to be the same thing in the sky but it was higher up and further away and we were driving and didn&#39;t get that good of a look at it.

We recommend that witnesses, when they see something unusual, stop their car and either get out of the vehicle, or open its windows, to view an unusual object.  Being stationary helps the witness establish whether the object is moving, or stationary.  Also, glass can distort the appearance of an object.  These witnesses may have done that.  PD))<n>

It was a cloudless moonless night from our perspective. looking towrds the SE at the mountains a &#39;silver orange&#39; or &#39;chrome orange&#39; ball popped up from behind the mountain range and made a very slow circle around our camp at an altitude of aproximately 5-6 K ft. The object moved from the SE to the East and then headed to the NW, then to the NE and then popped back down below the mountains. It made no noise and moved as if it were drunk - it jerked back and forth and wiggled a bit. It appeared to be about the size of the end of a pencil held at arms legnth.

I note that 24AU01 falls on a Friday, which made me wonder whether the date indicated might have a typo in it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thank you very much for sharing the information with our Center!<n> <n><n> <n><n> Cordially,<n> <n><n> <n><n> Hello Mr. Davenport,<n> <n><n> <n><n> Unfortunately this was not a campground but a &#39;wild site&#39;. I rarely spend time at campgrounds when there are so many other wonderful locations for camping.  This is one of many strange things I have seen while camping. I hope to be able to file the other events as time permits.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At the time my girlfriend saw it too but, she is now my ex girlfriend and I have had to file a restraining<n> <n><n> order against her. I am unable to give you any details about her whereabouts at this time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am not quite sure of the date but it was at the end of August in 2000 and a Saturday night. I am now<n> <n><n> guessing it was the 26th after checking the calendar.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I hope this is helpfull.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((name deleted))<n>

It seemed low, crossing the paths of the stars above it.It made no sounds at all. My friend saw it,too, as we were discussing the strange object. After about 3 minutes of steady speed, it quickly went from white to yellow to red and totally disappeared.<n>
8/26/00 22:00|Trout Creek Recreation|OR|Light|2 minutes|A bright large round light that moved in horizontal, vertical and circle, and left in rapid speed.|9/17/00|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/014/S14011.html|28|ndxe200008| A bright large round light that moved in horizontal, vertical and circle, and left in rapid speed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On Aug 26, 2000 my daughter, son, his girlfriend and myself were sitting outside our camp at the Trout Creek Recreation Area campground, which is North of Madras, Or about 20 miles on the Deschutes River. We had spent a afternoon of fishing and were enjoying seeing the stars as we were away from the light pollution of the cities, We were concerned about the fire in the Ochoco National Forest and were aware of theairplanes that were flying and we also were seeing shooting stars. But to the North of us about half way up from the horizon we could see this very large light which was stationery when we first noticed it , however there where airplane lights flying towards it several maybe as many as three or four. All of a sudden the large light very quickly moved up and down in a vertical line, severnal times, very rapidly, then it moved side ways in a horizonal movement, then it went in a circle, a very tight small circle and then just took off at a amazing rate of speed to the northwest and disapeared there was no way the planes could even begin to follow. Observer&#39;s, a Medical Technologist for a hospital laboratory, a Dental Assistant, 2 are avid fishermen and use to observing the nite sky.<n>

It drifted across the sky (about an arm&#39;s length distance) and sat in the same spot for about 5 more minutes. All of a sudden it started to dim and come back brighter, then about 2 minutes later it went dark all together, came back instantly with a bright white flash and then disappeared again leaving 4 small &#34;dusty&#34; objects that also disappeared within 1-2 seconds. Then there was no trace of any lights at all.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Please see reports from San Diego for the same date.  PD))<n>

It was definetly not aircraft of any kind we were familular with. There were several occasions wher this &#34;thing&#34; would stop, unlike anything we had ever seen. As the UFO moved south it stopped for a period of about 45-60 seconds, compleatly hovering. Periodically, the craft would almost flash and pulsate. There seemed to be no rhyme or reason. As we looked we saw what looked like lights on the side of this craft. They resembled beams coming from all around circle. At this time there was no other aircraft in the sky! As this whole incident happend we saw no airplanes at all! Being so close to Linburgh Field we always have airtraffic. There were none during this whole episode until after the craft was gone and we, within ten minutes saw several airplanes landing and taking off.This was no airplane! We all were very intersted at this time and as the craft moved north once again, it seemed to stop almost directly above us and with a very bright, very dramatic explosion the crafts former red (unblinking) lights transformed into white light and with a blink of the eye that red hovering spot we had been witnessing had vanished. There after we saw no evidence of this incident. That is of course exept for the digital camcorder recording that we have. Please share with my family and I any information on what we have witnessed tonight. It has left us all with many theories.What the hell did we see tonight?<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Please see second report from San Diego for the same date, slightly different time.  PD))<n>

I looked up and realized it was 10 times brighter than any star I&#39;ve seen and it drifted very slowly( no sound). Upon closer look it was three red lights in the shape of a triangle at least 30K feet high. It was clear against the backing stars that it was moving VERY slow...we did&#39;nt see the begining but after about 15 minutes the lights began to pulse and fade. it then became one white light bursting into what appeared to be a stream of sparks like a fire works display would. This was no fire work display. I am a thirty five year old business owner and i have NEVER seen anything like this.There were six of us on that beach and we all agreed it was nothing we had ever seen. One guy tried his hardest to explain it away but after about ten minutes che gave in also.<n>
8/26/00 21:05|San Diego|CA|Light|1 minute|Red light in the sky, hovering no motion in any direction.

Blinked white light and them seemed to grow brighter and explode.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At the beach at Crown Point by Sea World in San Diego.  Teenager pointed out red light stationary in the sky directly over us. Aircraft were taking off from Lindbergh so we knew this was stationary not a moving aircraft.  This was not a Helicopter, We flashed our flash light at the red light.  It responded back with a white blink which left a halo effect of white light with the red light in the middle. The white light went out and then flashed again without any further blink  from our flash light.  The white light then appeared to grow and it seemed as though the object exploded. I read the UFO sighting from San Diego Search and Rescue from July.  This episode seems to be a mirror image of what was reported at that time. We tried to determine if this was a Laser being fired from one of the local military installations but could not ascertain any other light beams.  This was a single red light without any other objects near it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We have received several similar reports from the San Diego area.  The first recent sighting of a red light in that city was reported on July 25th, and it was covered by the local television news.  PD))<n>

8/25/00 23:00|Loveland|CO|Disk|2 minutes|saucer or disklike object with white strobe on top and orange, rotating band around circumference.|9/17/00|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/013/S13912.html|36|ndxe200008| saucer or disklike object with white strobe on top and orange, rotating band around circumference.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On the night of August 25th, my 14 year old son and I were returning home from football practice.  As we were headed in a northerly direction at approximately 21:30 MT, my son exclaimed, &#34;Hey Dad,what the heck kind of aircraft is that?&#34;  As I looked out the driver side window, I saw exactly what he was puzzled over.  About 1000 feet up, directly over the city was what appeared to be a saucer or disk-shaped craft.  This craft had, what I can best describe as a white, strobe-like light on top. Around it&#39;s entire circumference was a rotating orange band which seemed to revolve in a clockwise motion around the object.  What was even more interesting was that this object then turned off the strobe effect and it&#39;s rotating orange light.  At this point in time the craft was roughly 300 yards away from our car and we had been viewing it for about 1 minute.  It then appeared to assume the conventional aviation lights of a small plane!  As we turned west to continue the drive home, my son said &#34;Look, that thing is following us!&#34;  It seemed to be keeping a parallel course with the route we were taking.  As we pulled into our driveway, it remained on it&#39;s current course and we quickly lost site of view.  The total viewing time of this incident was between 2 and 3 minutes.  I am a computer specialst by trade and my son is a bright, mature, and fairly average teenage kid who dislikes being the center of attention.  The only reason I&#39;m reporting this incident is because we felt it so bizarre and it needed to be archived somewhere.  We live about 5 miles from a small airport and see aircraft in the night sky all the time, but this is the first time I&#39;ve seen anything close to this......!<n>
8/25/00 22:30|Lewiston|ME|Circle|60 min|Third clear night  UFO sighting observed in Western sky with red and greenish blinking lights, Lewiston, Maine.|9/17/00|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/013/S13904.html|37|ndxe200008| Third clear night  UFO sighting observed in Western sky with red and greenish blinking lights, Lewiston, Maine.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My husband and I sit on our back porch many evenings. For 3 of the past clear nights we have observed in the sky an object we cannot identify. This evening it was first seen again at about 20 - 30 degrees off the horizon, in the western sky. The object appeared to be round in shape, with blinking red and green lights. It would move slightly about 5 degrees first to the north,then south,the east and west. Then it moved very slowly downward, as if perhaps it might land somewhere. We could still see it in the sky, but very low. We called the tower at the Portland Jetport to report tyhis unusual sighting. We asked if anything could be observed on radar. The gal told us there was only one plane that could be seen on radar. We also saw this same plane she was referring to. This was NOT the same object we were observing, but another.There was nothing else shown on radar. The gal suggested we call your center  to report sighting. My husband and myself are both self employed professionals. We are also intelligent, sane people. We both are in our early fifties. We have clear minds and do not suffer from any mental problems, dementia or hallucinations of any kind. Neither of us consume alcohol, and were of sound mind when we saw/have seen this object last three clear nights. We can supply you with references if necessary.<n>

The light suddenly dissapeared. We drove a bit more when we looked upward and we seen two lights one greenish-blue one red.  We got pretty close so we pulled into a back road two miles west of onoway we drove for a bit while keeping an eye on it . We drove until it  was a little to the left of it and it was hovering. There was now a third light which was yellow-orange. The craft was triangular shaped but was square on the corners like so:      __ <n> R <n> /        \ _ /            \_ Y      \_ -------------_/   G It sat and hovered there at about 400 meters in the air. It then started to move westward really slowly then it was directly above us.the green and red lights were at the front of the craft. It slowly accelerated and then made an abrupt turn left heading south while the red and yellow lights were facing south so the craft didn&#39;t really rotate.it then stopped and hovered for about 15 seconds we then turned my truck around and started to head home.  I live on the other side of the highway from the back road I was on. the Craft started to follow us. We went north towards my house while the craft went northnorthwest we got home and it was still tavelling the same direction.  We got home and could not see it because it was probably behind the trees.  We jumped on the quad and drove into the field we seen it again it was coming straight at us and then stopped and hovered while the only lights we could see was orange and red beccause of the angle it was at. It then dissappeared.  we seen it aways higher and then dissappeared again. it was then higher tan before and had travelled double the distance it had before it this once more and there was like lightning that lit up the sky and the craft was gone.but there was not a cloud in the sky. we could see all the stars Thats about it but I have seen lights similar to this for the past week or two.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  The image may have started out OK, but it probably did not survive the changes caused by our 1) e-mail program and 2) database formatting.  We will attempt to get an illustration of the object.  PD))<n>

As I looked up I saw a triangle shaped object go over my head it made no sound. I cant say how close it was but I felt it go pass just like a low flying helicopter but no sound but with the downbreese It had three white lights one on each corner. As it passed overhead it was silent. It was slow moving I watched it as it turned out towards the north sea.<n>

There were no blinking lights on the object which would indicate that it was an airplane. The object came from the north an traveled towards the southwest. I listened for sound as the object moved away but there was none.I would estimate that the object had to be at a minimum of 30,000 ft.<n>

It looked like a regular airplane, then we noticed 2 more.  They didn&#39;t appear to be moving for a minute, but then they started moving and seemed to be circling an area.  It could have been anything at all, nothing unusual, but we felt that there was a story behind it.  So we grabbed some taco bell and set out on the highway to find a way to get closer to what these &#34;planes&#34; were circling.  We belive we saw a military aircraft (but not positive) because it seemed to be still in mid-air, then just took off at great speed.  Not your regular passenger jet.  Anyways, we were going down the on-ramp to get onto 405 southbound from Bothell, and what do you know, there was a PACSAT van right there, with a satellite, stopped on the side of the road.  We passed by him, then he started up his van and came onto the highway as well.  I slowed down my car to let him pass me because we thought we would follow him for a while, which we did, and he was driving pretty quickly (over the speed limit), but he went too far South for us to venture out any further at that hour.  We headed back home.  We believe that something was going on somewhere near Woodinville/Kirkland/Redmond area.  We haven&#39;t seen anything in the news since!  The next evening near the same time, we noticed quite a bit of air traffic near the same area.  Slow moving &#34;planes&#34; that would suddenly increase in speed, but circle the area.  I wish that someone else would have seen too.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We received no other reports from this area of Seattle for this time and date.  The area is in the approach/departure area for Sea-Tac Airport, so it is not clear how &#34;military&#34; aircraft could be operating in this area when normal operations of commercial traffic are taking place.  We will attempt to inquire of the witness what a PACSAT van with a satellite is.  PD))<n>

I was facing east.There was a tall building to my right which prevented me from seeing it until the 12 o clock position. What I saw first was a burst of light, yellow/orange in front and red in rear blending together in the middle. The object seemed to be much higher than an airplane. I thought it was a star to star to start with. The object began moving in a zig-zag pattern from south to north and at every change of direction the same burst of light would appear. what was so amazing was the speed at which it traveled, it seemed to almost jump from point to point. the object disappeared at about the 9 o clock position. Nothing that I know of can move that fast at that altitude. It was about the speed of a shooting star only much much higher.<n>

At that point I was at mile post 182. I continued to drive until I was directly beneath the object at mile post 184.5.  At that time I noticed the object was not a diamond, but rather a series of dotted white lights that formed a boomerang shape with a bright soft light at the vertex.  The object appeared to be silent and still. I stepped out of my vehicle and whatched the object approximately 8 min.  I feel others had witnessed the lights because vehicles were weaving in their lanes as they drove under the object.  I drive this route quite frequently and am aware of the crop dusters and other aircraft in the area and am positive this was not of the ordinary.  I also am very familiar with the different types of aircraft, because I am a former flight attendant.<n>

I noticed clusters of four bright lights in seven groupings flying from northwest to southeast over the lake and harbor. At first I thought they may be seagulls reflecting the light from the setting sun off of their bodies or wings but the lights stayed constant and never varied in distance or intensity from one to the other.  I further believe I would not have been able to see them at all if the light had not been just right.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date may be approximate, although the witness does not indicate that fact.

One light brighter (closer or larger) than others it disappeared last.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At about 0217 23Aug00 I got up to use the bathroom. I didn&#39;t turn on any lights in the house.  I have computer equip and radios that has LEDs that guide my way to the restroom. When I started back across the house one of my dogs wanted outside to do his business, this is normal.  I let the dog out and I looked up towards the moon which was mostly covered with clouds.  I saw some blue flashes.  I was still partially asleep so I rubbed my eyes so I could focus.  Once I got my eyes clear I saw several flashes of blue light. I rubbed my eyes again because I was blinking during the event.  I looked again towards the moon and saw two last flashes.  At this point my eyes were &#34;wide open&#34; and clear.  The flashes were circles that when flashed turned small and disappeared.  The total time was maybe 1/3 to 1/4 sec.  They appeared to look like an arc when using a electric welder.  If you can imagin seeing a welder strike the first arc to begin his weld.  This was also the colour.  A very beautiful blue flash that disappered as quick as it lit. I thought it might have been a cloud moving across a star.  But I realized that I have to much experience to believe this.  I didn&#39;t have my Celestron software loaded, but took the time to do so.  I noticed that there were two stars near the moon.  Both having a mag of less than 1.  Jupiter was also just above the moon.  But the flashes were not that far away.  They were between the moon and earth. The moon was at RA/Dec = 4h 31m 29s / 17d 31m 3sN.  I was looking east. This morning (020024Aug00) I got up again at about the same time (I had the alarm set).  I went thru the same routine.  I went out looked up at the moon which was partialy covered with clouds (about the same as the night before).  I didn&#39;t see anything out of the norm. I live 35 miles SE of Tucson.  The lights of Tucson do not effect viewing the stars.  We have a clear view with out any twinkling (atmostpheric changes). This even was not normal.  I even called Kitt Peak and left a message.  It was not returned. I have over 5k hours flying corporate jets.  This was not aircraft strobe lights.  There was no sound.  This is the first time I have ever reported anything out of the ordinary.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke to this witness, and we found him to be quite credible.

I know it was over cast and I could hear a commercial air liner in the distance.  As I looked up I saw a bright flash, similar to a strobe light on an aircraft , what caught my attention , was the time and distance between flashes.  No plane I&#39;ve ever seen could travel that fast between  flashes, and what was even more strange, there was no sound, absouletly none.  Like I said there was a distant  sound of a jet , and that was still heard after this object was long gone.  It  moved from the southeast toward the northwest,  like from Winona  MN to  Minneapolis  MN.   The total time I observed this object, couldn&#39;t  have been morre than  15 secs.   I know for sure I saw  3 flashes, then due to my location where I was standing, with trees and the house, buy the time I changed my stand for another view, it was gone.  It was overcast, and I&#39;m not sure what the ceiling was,  but it&#39;s my  guess  it had to be less then 3000&#39; and it definitely was under the overcast.<n>

I had gone to the beach, with my binoculars and a constellation map, in an attempt to observe some of these constellations and stars.I was down on the beach approximately an hour and a half and had just put the binoculars down to take a break from looking at the sky. I was staring out over the Bay when I noticed a bright light just above me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I worked in a factory that was located by the airport in Toronto, and because the location was almost directly underneath the flight path for large planes that were landing. At night when they were close enough the lights were very bright, and that is what I thought I was observing on this night. Then it dawned on me, hey there are no airports within at least 150KM., large enough for planes that size.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What I thought I saw was something entering our atmosphere(like a meteor that gets brighter as it burns up on entry), but what I saw was like the total opposite. Instead of getting brighter, it started to grow dimmer and smaller until it was the size of a star that you would see on any night. Then it started to move in a west to east direction moving faster than anything I&#39;ve ever observed in the sky(be it a plane, or a sattelite). At that time I reached for my binoculars, but by the time I grabbed them, and looked back at the sky I could no longer find this object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We assume the witness implies an approximate date of August 21, 2000.

I saw a very bright shimmering light that was heading directly toward me.  We live in a landing pattern path for Sea-Tac so I assumed it was a plane coming in for the final approach.  I left the room for a couple of minutes and when I came back  the light was still in the same place and there were colored lights flashing all around its perimeter.  I have never seen a plane do that, or look like that so I got the binoculars for a closer look.  There was a dark object that had a shape similar to an airplane but was rounder in the center, with a big &#34; wing &#34; span.  The colored lights were very bright and seemed to be flashing in a random manner.  It was still in the same place.  At this point I awoke my husband and told him to look.  He did and was as amazed as I was.  It was no plane.  It was no star.  It was a craft of some sort and it was right in front of us!  He watched it for several minutes and had to return to bed for a early rising hour.  I continued to watch with and without the binoculars.  The craft had indeed moved but so slowly you couldn&#39;t detect it.  I had placed its position at the top of a tree that stands below our house when I first saw it.  When my husband went back to bed a little after 11, it had moved slightly upward in a north easterly direction.  By this time I had decided that I was watching a ufo and that I would watch it for as long as it took for it to do something. I drew a rough diagram of the dark shape that I saw, wrote down the colors of the lights and continued the watching until 1:00am. The craft had moved upward at about a 40-45 degree angle in a north easterly direction until the last hour when it seemed to shift its heading to a more southerly direction.  At that time the eave of the roof got in the way so I went to bed. The craft had 9 lights.  One in the center, larger than the other 8.  That light flashed from bright blue to a silvery white.  The lights that would have been on the &#34; wing &#34; tips if it were a plane also flashed the blue and silvery color.  The remainder of the lights flashed a rusty orange, silvery white.  The flashing was random to the eye.  There was a distinct strobing effect every 1/2 second or so that was a pale electric blue.  The strobe was only visible through the binoculars, but was visible from the closest point to the furtherest point. I am snail-mailing my drawing of the shape within the lights for your perusal.  Thanks for your time. ((name deleted))<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  The report seems to us to be both sincere and well prepared.  We do not understand how an &#34;object&#34; can be either in, or near, an airport Terminal Control Area, which Sea-Tac has, and the airport apparently continues to function normally.  We would have guessed that the report had been caused by a &#34;twinkling&#34; star, but it apparently moved in the wrong direction in the course of the night.  We also do not understand why a witness would look at something as bizarre as this object was, and not get a photograph, call the press or television, call out neighbors, etc., all of which is absent from the report.  We do not know what the witnesses observed last night!  PD))<n>

To the right and slightly north of the triangle, there was a much larger, brighter, reddish-orangey light, about the size of a large superball, maybe a tiny bit bigger.  It moved in a straight line, until I could no longer see it from where I was sitting.  In the above information, I put 2-4 crafts, because I am unsure as to whether or not the three smaller lights were one craft or three separate ones.  The large one was definitely separate from the triangular lights.  It also had a sort of haze around it, like the light was very bright.<n>

They were moving across the sky to the southwest. The sun had just gone below the horizon and the objects seemed to be reflecting sunlight. I&#39;m not sure of their altitude but it must have been at least ten thousand feet for them to still be reflecting sunlight. My first thought was that they were large military aircraft flying in formation, but as they passed overhead the trailing object seemed to break formation and continue in a more southerly direction. They moved fairly quickly and made no noise.<n>

It continued to move above the small plane and then seemed to stop in mid air hence going straight down at an unbelivable rate of speed and again in my vision, below the airplane and then seemed to disappear into no where or in the direction of the Black Hills.

The sky was so clear that we could see numerous stars.  Expect there were verticle rays of light, similar to when the sun shines through clouds during the day. These rays were vertically rippling.  When we pulled over they seemed to condense.  We decided to leave (quickly) we pulled over about 1/2hour later and the condensed light seem to still be to the right side of the car.  We when home.  When we got out of the car it was over head.  I got the camera but could not get a picture (wouldn&#39;t work), then I got the video camera (would work outside).  My wife took one picture of me looking up when developed two balls of light are above and to the left of my head.  The second picture she took, you can see one of the lights, speeding up going over and around my head and then slowing down and moving to my right ear.  You see the start point and stop point as well as a bright green trail of movement it took.  The trail of movement clearly shows the light speed up /////  /   /   / /  /  /   /   / / ////// and slow down in a curved path.  The second light does a motion left turns right ///// /  /   /   /     /  and is gone.  What scares me is that these are two very organised recognisable paths that these white light took and then one was gone and one is seen beside my ear in the split second that it takes to get a picture.  Our camera would not work shooting upward but did work at a face to face type level.  Behind me is nothing but, forest, which can not be seen in the picture because it was dark (with the exception of the sky).  Off in the distance that night we also saw a verticle bright beem of light going strait up into the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We do not know what the individuals witnessed, but we feel that a laser-based advertising light would have to be ruled out.

Moreover, we would not expect an advertising light to be used at 0300 hrs.., since they are very expensive to operate.  PD))<n>

8/21/00|Fayetteville|NC|Unknown|about    a minute|report in north carolina and a similar report  in  south carolina|9/17/00|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/013/S13908.html|72|ndxe200008| report in north carolina and a similar report  in  south carolina<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was on the phone talking to my girlfriend  and  i had look out the window, to see if there was something out side. and i looked up   and saw a  bright light i couldnt make out the object or what ever it was. but i know for a fact it seem pretty advance to travel  fast and then slow down and stop then speed up and slow down again. it stayed bright for about 30 seconds. and when it was bright it was moving pretty damn fast. and my house is positions north and it was about  4 degrees north or so. it was around  10:40 or 11  something or so but  it was heading at a fast speed and then it just disappeared. but it more of   faded out like a star or something or a light dimiming or something and  while it was  dimming it slowed down and after that i didnt see anything else . i told my  girlfriend when i was on the phone and she said that  maybe the secret base near by  may be doing some kind of test flight  or something i didnt hear anything that night  and  it didnt make a sound . there are 2 military bases near by     one  everyone knows  and one    is secret. but  my mom told me that someone  else had reported a bright light not to far from  our house  and that sighting was in 1997.   and also my grand uncle had the same incident before  just like what i saw and my mom told me his whole story. but his sighting was in south carolina near manning and summerton. and when he saw the light he pulled his truck over and got out and look at it. and my mom said when he told her  when the light came close it   had   got  too close to where his truck was so he  started the truck up and  tryed to get to my grandpa&#39;s house and  the light followed him  closer and closer.and when my  granduncle made it to my grandpa&#39;s house  he jump in the bushes near the porch and my grandpa came out the door and  he saw the light also but  it faded like a start before he could of goten a good look at it. my granduncle told my grandpa everything and my grandma thought  he was lying b/c he was drunk but my grandpa  saw the light   but ! didnt  g et a good look. my grandpa believes my granduncle b/c when every he see something he&#39;s not going to lie about it   and plus when  or when he ever gets drunk he talks about  all the things that happens but  he didnt barely drink anything  at that time  he wasnt even tipsy. my mom told me every thing that happen that night and she was listening to everything. but anyway i&#39;m 16 and  i believe that theres something going on out there. next time i&#39;m going to have a camcorder ready<n>

The object stayed about 5-10 degrees above the horizon as it moved. It moved about 10-15 degrees in the 5 minutes I watched it. I lost sight of the object after the 5 minutes.<n>

We saw an aircraft coming toward the house like usual. Stewart International Airport has a route that flies straight over my neighborhood. The craft came closer, and we noticed it was not an airliner but a strange aircraft. It was an octagon shape and all black with a bright, white light on each end. It made an extrordianry loud noise and flew at about 20 MPH and was 30 feet wide and 30 feet long. It was not a helicopter because we felt no wind coming down on us. The craft was very low to the ground, only about 50 feet from it. It flew over my house. We have a TV antenna on the roof and the craft was low enough to just pass over it by inches. The craft then slowly moved over the roof, so we ran to the backyard to see it come over but it was gone. It must have blasted off.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD))<n>

Above the Limerick Nuclear Power Plant, I saw a disc shaped object moving slowly and silently from south to north across the sky. The sky was clear. The object appeared to be at approximately 700ft. From my point of view, it appeared about 1/2 inch across, and I was 6 miles from the power plant. I used binoculars and could see the object appeared transparent and glassy around the entire surface, with bright lights, blue, white, red and orange, flashing across the center of the object. I also observed another, tiny white flashing light below and to the north of the object, traveling near it. I observed the disc until it was no longer in my field of vision.<n>

The lights flashed brightly every few seconds, bright as two headlights on an approaching car. This is the best way I can describe them. They were really bright, but not bright enough to light up the sky. They began to circle each other, very slowly in a clockwise direction. The lights crept away from each other across the horizon. The light that was moving to the right made me think. The shadow on the moon is cast by the earth. The flashing light did not show up on the shadow. That light must have traveled behind the moon. I&#39;m not sure the exact date of this experience but my mom and i were putting the sprinklers away for the night so i assume it was late august or more towards early spring perhaps april or may. Everyone i talked to about this said they had never heard of anything like it. We should&#39;ve reported it as soon as it happened, but we didn&#39;t and i&#39;ve been trying to figure out what the lights could&#39;ve been ever since. I&#39;m curious if anyone else has ever seen ne thing like this.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

The first siting occured in about 10 years ago.  My brother and I and one of his friends were bouncing on the trampoline during a typical sleepover at my house.  My brother got off of the trampoline to go into the house and get a drink.  So, while my brother&#39;s friend and I waited for him to come back, we both naturally started looking at the stars.  We had both spotted the same red light (looked like a star only red).  It was traveling at a much faster pace than a jet or any other &#34;earthly&#34; known craft could have gone.  Plus, there were  no blinking lights that are typical of planes in the sky.  Anyway, it was traveling in a straight line for about 2 seconds and then made this small turn and curved back in the opposite direction that it was traveling and sped off so fast that I could not see where it had gone.  I have seen this only one other time, about 1 year ago, and it was a white nonflashing light and traveled one direction in at an unearthly speed.<n>
8/20/00 15:01|Dickson City|PA|Cylinder|30 minutes|Multiple sighting report!|9/21/00|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/014/S14171.html|82|ndxe200008| Multiple sighting report!<n> <n><n> <n><n> Hi, I wish to report a sighting. It occurred on August 20th, 2000. To begin with I wanted to go for a walk at 2:30 PM, so I decided to walk to a supermarket that was about a half hour walk! I got to the store at 2:55 PM bought coffee and left. On the way home I noticed the sky was very clear, yet there were some small white clouds! I was amazed there wasn&#39;t any chemtrails today! Then at 3:01 PM, I noticed a long chrome colored rod or bar shaped craft slowly moving from the east to the west. I kept looking at it and didn&#39;t see any wings on it! It then looked as if it disappeared. I kept walking home. Then when I was almost home at 3:21 PM, I saw the chrome rod again! I don&#39;t know if it was the same one, but it was the same as the one I saw at 3:01 PM. I noticed it was moving in the same direction again, from the east to the west, but this time I noticed there was a faint chemtrail cloud over the mountains in the west! I saw the chrome rod shaped craft go through this very this cloud and it vanished! Yet I could see it cutting a trail through this very thin almost clear cloud! It cut a path through it like an ice cutter does in frozen waters! Then at 3:27 PM, when I was only one block away from my house, near a funeral home parking lot, I notice the chrome rod one more time! This time it was moving from the west to the east! I also noticed that there was a cloud in the sky that looked sort of fake, for it looked like the edge of it was oily! Then to the lower left of that cloud there was a very tiny white cloud. Well the chrome rod shaped craft headed slowly toward this cloud, yet while it was heading there I saw the craft vanish and re-appear about 3 times against a background of clear blue sky! When it got near the big fake looking cloud it passed under it, but went into the very tiny white cloud and vanished! It never came out of it! Then when I got to my house, my sister came out and I told her about it! She didn&#39;t believe me. I showed her the cloud and we watched but we didn&#39;t see the chrome bar shaped craft anymore. But then, from the fake looking cloud a black flat object dropped from it, then flew quickly into the west! She said it looked like a bird, but it wasn&#39;t! I ran to get my dad&#39;s video recorder, but both batteries were completely dead! Well that ends this sighting report! If your interested, I had more sightings I never reported. They are below. In the winter of 1994, I got up in the middle of the night because I couldn&#39;t sleep. For some reason I looked out the window and saw a very bright amber colored light heading from out of the south to the north. It was heading towards my house! The amber color is beyond explanation, for it pulsed from bright amber to complete darkness, and inside the amber was a reddish color! When it got closer it instantly turned to the east and looked like it was following the Lackawanna river that is near my house! When it turned I could see how the side of this craft looked! It had a very flat thin dark black bottom, and it&#39;s top part was amber with red in the middle and was pulsing off and on slowly! Then as it followed the river, something happened! It&#39;s hard to explain this but here goes! It was ejecting things from the craft, but you couldn&#39;t see them until it got away from the craft! They then looked like sparks falling to the Earth! I notice it did that until I couldn&#39;t see it any more! End of that sighting. Then this one is the best of all sightings! It happened in late March or early April of 1997! It was around then because Passover was approaching! Well the sun just set and it was still bright out! I always lay on my couch and look out the window towards the mountains in the south. Then I noticed the stars were becoming noticeable. It was then, just above the mountain range to the south I noticed what I thought was a star. But to my surprise it jumped from about 1 inch over the mountain, to about 2 feet above the mountain! When I say 1 inch and 2 feet, that&#39;s just how it looks from my window! Then when it jumped higher in the sky, it got extremely bright, then went back to it&#39;s normal brightness! It did that 3 times, then I almost fainted, for what I saw I couldn&#39;t believe my eyes! I guess that craft that looked like a star signaled another craft that the coast was clear, for as soon as it pulsed 3 times this happened! The exact, and I repeat the exact craft that Bob Lazar calls the sport model came from out of the east, and went to the west! It was so close over the house tops I couldn&#39;t believe it! It was bronze in color, and had towards the bottom, light spinning just like on the Jupiter II of the original Lost in Space series! I saw it&#39;s lighted interior, but I couldn&#39;t see any beings or men in the windows! I watched it until I couldn&#39;t see it any more form my window, then I ran downstairs and outside, but it was gone! It didn&#39;t move fast, yet it was silent and very stable! It was so sleek and awesome! When I saw that craft, I knew Bob Lazar was telling the truth! That craft was his sports model UFO! Yet to this day, no one reported this! Not one! I saw it but couldn&#39;t believe my eyes! I always listen to Jeff Rense and I used to listen to the Art Bell show, and from one show that Art Bell had on I think I found out something! I remember Art had on a guest named Victor that had a clip called the alien interview! Well he said this, &#34; From what I understand, all the alien craft have been moved into the northeast! &#34; Well I think they have moved into the mountains near my house! For some strange reason they have built a highway atop of southern mountain range in which I have seen Bob Lazars sports model UFO! During the night about 3:00 AM I see lights in the clearings of the mountains, I don&#39;t think they are vehicles! Yet I don&#39;t know! I also hear many nights the droning noise of turbine engines coming from the mountains! I see craft that are very dark flying ultra fast towards the mountains! They move so fast they look like your seeing things! Well that&#39;s it for me. End of this report!<n>

Looking to the north this bright lighted object came from the north in a south direction stopping along the way. It appeared to be looking at the airport. It hovered over the south end of the airport for approx 5 minutes turned 180 deg and slowly headed North. It looked like a bright light bulb shining in the sky. It faded out in the haze to the north.<n>

Watched for a minute or two to see if it would move...it wouldn&#39;t. Noticed that it slowly appeared to be changing shape...round to boomerang, then to cigar shape then back to round. Always remained white. Not metallic or sparkly or flashing or pulsing....just solid white and changing it&#39;s shape slowly. This was not an aircraft or balloon. Local planetarium closed so called police. Officer showed up and was amazed as well but had no idea what it was either. My mother saw it and a neighbor. Unfortunately...no one had binoculars. The object was in the foreground compared to the moon..in other words..not behind the moon...but closer. Watched for an hour and it seemed to dissapear.  I am a skeptic and would not even have bothered searching for a web site such as this if I had never seen this object!<n>
8/20/00 08:00|Bellevue (Capehart)|NE|Teardrop|10 seconds|Black Tear Drop Shape over Offut Air Force Base.|9/17/00|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/013/S13919.html|88|ndxe200008| Black Tear Drop Shape over Offut Air Force Base.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The week before the airshow (Thunder in the Heartland Aug 26-28) at Offut Air Force Base, while taking children to school I observed a black tear-drop shaped silhouette aprox 1-5 miles away.It appeared from behind the trees and disappear behind another set of trees. The craft was flying slowly from the SW to the South. The teardrop shape was oriented so that the smaller pointed end was the front of the aircraft. It gave me the impression of being slow and ponderous. I did not observe any tail section, propellors or rotors. Since it was a side-on silhouette I would not have been able to observe any wings. As it flew behind the trees I pointed it out to the driver of the vehicle I was in. We waited for it to come out from behind the trees but, it never did.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Given that the sighting occurred close to an Air Force base, our first consideration would be that the witness might have observed an aircraft. Since the sighting occurred just days before an air show seems to emphasize such a possibility.  The shape of the object is reminiscent of the fuselage of a Hughes 500-series helicopter.  However, that is only a guess.  We will attempt to pin down the precise date of the sighting.  PD))<n>

My friend has already been watching it for about a hour before I got to his house to go fishing.  He told me he had watched it zip back and forth (east to west), quite a bit, but that it had been stationary for around thirty minutes before I got there.  Just looking up in the sky at it, it looked like two stars, one on top of the other.  When I looked through his binoculars, I was really surprised!! I had never seen anything like it!  It was a bright red and turquoise! (bluegreen)  It was kind of flickering the colors, and I didn&#39;t know if it was me moving the binoculars a little or if it was kind of jiddering a little.  I watched it a few minutes then brought down the binoculars.  I could still see a flash of red and then turquoise.  It was only one object and my friend said it was shaped like a bracelet.  He could observe it closer when he watched it zipping back and forth with the binoculars.  We were &#34;in town&#34;, but the object was at a 45% angle to the east (kind of south too), which would have placed it over wooded areas.  There&#39;s a river east of us about 20 miles....don&#39;t know if it might have been over it or not. Best I recall, there was red on the top and bottom, and the turquoise color was in the center.  It didn&#39;t effect us other than fascination!  I&#39;m 51, and I&#39;ve NEVER seen anything like it before!  Wish I knew if others had.  I watched it till daylight, then I couldn&#39;t see it any more.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Ordinarily, our first assumption in a case like this would be that the witness is reporting a &#34;twinkling&#34; star.

I am almost 60 years old and I have never seen a UFO before.  The date that I have given for the sighting is an estimated date.  I didn&#39;t have a way to officially report the incident until now. For the last 11 years I have had a paper route and for the past 5 years I have had 2 paper routes.  When I finish the 1st one, I sometimes stop to use the restroom in a deserted road area.  It&#39;s located in the mountaineous area that goes up to the ski basin outside of Santa Fe, NM.  While I was standing there, I was facing down the mountain. You can easily see the lights from Los Alamos, NM  which is approximately 30 miles away on any clear night.  All of a sudden, I noticed what I thought was a shooting star light up over the Los Alamos area.  It looked like a spark from a sparkler.  The spark shot straight across the sky approximately 3000ft(?) in the air and when it got to where it appeared to be over the Villa Linda Mall area(which would have been about 10 miles from me), there was a number(5?) of what looked like huge flash bulb explosions and they initially were round flashes, but as they grew in size, they were apparently enclosed in something square shaped and the entire square was filled with the bright looking flashes until it looked like one big square flash... Then it went out.  The whole thing took no more than 5 to 10 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>
8/19/00 23:00|Lake Havasu|AZ|Other|3 1/2 hours|Black Tent|9/17/00|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/013/S13871.html|91|ndxe200008| Black Tent<n> <n><n> <n><n> This file is public information and available for immediate download at: ((URL deleted)) --- On Saturday August 19, my girlfriend ((name deleted)) and I drove into Lake Havasu State Park to find a campsite for the night. The past week on our vacation we had been car camping and traveling from our home in San Diego to El Paso Texas, North to Albuquerque, West for two nights and one day at the Grand Canyon and back to San Diego. Lake Havasu was hot. So hot, that night I could not go inside the tent with ((name deleted)), but layed on a picnic bench on our campsite with only a pair of swim trunks on. The picnic bench had a metal top with holes, coated with a thick lacquer. I woke after some time and noticed a large black tent not more than 20 feet from me. I layed on the bench with my eyes half open wondering how someone could have set up this tent without waking me. As I layed there I was aware of quite a lot of activity around me, and in the area. Around dusk another group had set up their camp several sites distance from us, so I assumed they were just a bunch of happy campers milling around the area. At least they were not playing music or talking, or ((name deleted)) would be having a fit. The tent was black. So black, I would call it theatre black. I was thirsty so I woke a little more, sat on the bench facing the tent and puzzled over it. It stood approximately 20 feet tall. The top came together in a pyramid, tight woven fishnet, high tech material. The base was approximately 30 feet square, the sides were not vertical, so the top was a ten foot pyramid with a 30 foot base. I walked over to my car and opened the hatch to get a plastic gallon jug of water. I took a long drink of the hot water, as much as I could stand, and closed the hatch. I figured I had woken my girlfriend in our tent a few feet from the car, so I asked her if she was awake. She did not reply. I figured she was giving me the silent treatment because she was ((angry)). She had been complaining about all the noise in the area, and earlier woke me when she said I was playing my radio. It was someone on a boat on the lake, so I told her so and went back to sleep. There was a lot of activity around me although I couldn&#39;t see anyone. At night I carry a flashlight. Near a bush where I heard footsteps, I shined the light on it. I saw nothing and the movement stopped. Someone might ask, &#34;weren&#39;t you afraid?&#34; For some reason I wasn&#39;t. Camping in remote areas can get kind of spooky at night, thinking you are hearing something outside the tent. I tend to feel a little more secure in state campgrounds. I have night vision and a gun. Both were in the tent. But because of my girlfriends bitchy attitude I didn&#39;t go in our tent, risking waking her. I wanted to walk nearer the large black tent, but I am cautious about respecting other people&#39;s camp. I moved around our area to get a better view of it, the entire time sensing movement and hearing footsteps in the hard gravel. I went back to the park bench and layed down on to as I did before. Soon I was asleep. I woke again. The tent was still there, the same activity near us. I asked Mary if she was awake and I saw her flashlight in our tent. I knew she had looked at her watch, so I asked her what time it was. She said it was 1:30. The park bench was very uncomfortable and it seemed to be a little cooler. I thought it might be cool enough to sleep in our tent now, so I opened it and went in, layed down on our air mattress and went to sleep thinking I would wake early to get a better look at the large black tent at the campsite across from ours. I awoke just as the eastern horizon was lightening. This time of year, it gets bearable at about 3 am. However I swear I can feel the heat coming on about 15 minutes before sunrise. I woke my girlfriend and she agreed we would break camp. I opened our tent. The large black tent was gone. The camp area was silent. As we were tearing down our campsite and packing my car, I told her of the tent and the activity. She agreed there was a lot of activity in the area, so much that she had put earplugs so she could sleep, yet we heard no talking or music in the campground. We both walked onto the campsite where the black tent was. I wanted to verify the site was large enough for a tent the size I had seen. It was. We searched for impressions in the hard gravel, although the gravel was so hard you could park a loaded semi truck on the site without leaving an impression. We saw no evidence. --- East of Gallup New Mexico is a natural formation called Church Rock. There is a state campground there, Red Rock State Park. We hiked as close as we could get to the Church Rock formation, and as we were returning to our campsite we came across this interesting footprint: ((URL deleted))<n>

I could not see where it went because it disappeared so fast. The object was very much a triangle and did not glow like a meteor, but the surrounding flash lit the object.

I parked my motorcycle in the bushes and walked down to the dunes overlooking the ocean to the west with my sleeping bag. It was a beautiful clear night and warm. I lay there in my sleeping bag looking over the ocean and saw the lights of a fishing boat a mile or so out. As I was watching the boat I noticed a circular amber light hovering above the water in the vacinity of the boat and to its left. The light was nothing I had ever seen before. It was an amber red rotating pinwheel that pulsed with bright and dull light.  The boat must have seen it. I had an eerie feeling as I watched it, almost like I knew it knew I was aware of it. There was no sound at all. As I watched it for about 1 minute it suddenly went out, like someone turned a light out. It didn&#39;t fade out, but just blinked out to blackness.  I have kept this sighting in my mind for those years and now feel justified in reporting it as a UFO considering other similar reports which I&#39;ve read.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thanks, ((name deleted)), Rhode Island.<n>

After going around the new home construction, the road turned left into Baxter Road and headed west towards the 15 freeway.   While traveling down Baxter Road approaching the 15 overpass, I noticed an object in the sky due North of my location.  I began to observe it trying to figure out exactly what it might be.  The most obvious to me was some kind of new kite? since I could not make out any contours or distinct edges.  It was dark, almost black, oval with what appeared to be a very short, wide tail. I continued to observe it for another 10-15 seconds or so wondering where the person was and trying to make out the string.   Suddenly, the object started to move quite quickly in short abrupt movements back and forth (possibly in a triangular shape?).  My thoughts went to that there was possibly two strings attached which could pull it in different directions.   As I strained to see the strings attached, the object suddenly, and without warning accelerated away from me to the southeast.  It accelerated so quickly that it turned into a blur and disappeared into thin air.  In trying to follow its movement, I turned while standing on my bicycle and ended up on the other side of the road as a result of my left arm overcompensating to my abrupt turn to the right.  I stopped and placed my foot on the ground turning completely around so that I might be able to bring it back into vision.  However, the object was completely gone from my view and could not be found anywhere in the sky. At that point, I realized what I had possibly witnessed and I continued to search for it in the sky.  I began to realize that the reason I couldn’t see any distinct edges was that the object was actually quite far from me.  That probably was also the reason why I didn’t hear anything (over the freeway noise).  Finally I got back onto my bicycle and continued my ride wondering if what I had just witnessed had been for real.  No matter how hard I tried to dismiss it, I kept on realizing that I HAD indeed witnessed something extraordinary, something that could in fact change the way I viewed things for the rest of my life. I am a 41 year old male with an electrical engineering degree currently employed in my field.  Married with three children, with interests in outdoor activities.  I did not have any previous experiences nor did I have any concrete belief&#39;s in UFO&#39;s...until now.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We invite the reader to compare the description here with what was reported over the Rhode Island shoreline at 2030 hrs. on 22JN00 by a commercial pilot.  The objects witnessed by the two respective observers seem quite similar.  PD))<n>

Our dog always alerts us to sounds in the night and she didn&#39;t make a peep. The sounds were of a popping nature with shrills overlaying or interupting it. The sounds traveled from the east to west of us and lasted maybe 30 seconds. We couldn&#39;t see anything but there was a terrible smell that lasted a few minutes similar to that of burnt wiring and plastic.<n>

Shortly after settling into our sleeping bags, my brother-in-law directed my attention to a moving triangle in the sky directly above us, passing from North to South. It actually appeared to be three satellites, but at the moment I wasn&#39;t certain. I grabbed my binoculars to get a closer look and I could see stars passing between the points, satisfying my curiosity that these were indeed three independent objects, rather than one solid object. What was unusual was that they were moving in a perfect triangular formation. From my perspective, their distance apart from each other was about two finger-widths at arm&#39;s length. I looked at my watch to note the time. It was 10:51 p.m. After about a minute or two, the lead object faded out followed by the trailing objects seconds later.  Due to the late hour, and the location at which they faded, and the fact that they were moving slower than the average satellite, I concluded that they were much higher than the garden-variety low-Earth orbit satellites. After arriving home a few days later, I checked several of the satellite tracking web sites on the Internet in an attempt to identify what we saw. According to those databases, there were no satellites passing over that location at that particular moment.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We suspect that the report may address a sighting of military/intelligence satellites, launched and orbitting in formation, but which do not appear in any publicly posted tables of orbitting objects.

He directed our attention to the object, which made no sound.  As it rose from the North, it continued it&#39;s path in a Southerly direction.  The speed at which it was traveling was that of a satellite.  It traveled about the length of the big dipper, stopped, then proceeded in a North Easterly direction. It didn&#39;t turn, it stopped and changed direction.  Initially, it was a reddish color, but when it began travelling Northeast, it&#39;s color changed to a grayish color.  Throughout the siting the object was not focusable, it was blurry, but it did seem to have a saucer shape.  As it travelled Northeast, about half the distance of the big dipper, it faded completely from our view.  My sister-in-law was a sceptic, until she witnessed this siting with the three of us.  This was a bonafied UFO.  If anyone else witnessed this, please document it on this website.<n>

I was looking at the evening sky and when I looked through the top of my windshield, I noticed 3 lights in the sky.  At first, I thought maybe it was a helicopter because the lights were hovering.  The longer I watched the more uneasy I became. I got out of my van and went to the truck in front of me to ask if anyone was seeing what I was.  The man I spoke with said that &#34;yes, I&#39;m seeing it too&#34; before I could even get the question out of my mouth.  We watched it even after the train had passed because I wanted to listen for any sounds, but there weren&#39;t any.  It appeared to be dark in color and sort of diamond-shaped, only it had six sides. I would say it was approximately 75 yards in length.  There were 3 lights that went across one end in the form of a triangle.  The gentleman in the truck took off after nervous conversation so I left too because I didn&#39;t want to be alone.  I headed for Wal-Mart like a bat-out-of-hell and I didn&#39;t look up any more.  There were 8 people standing in the parking lot looking in the direction that I came from and when I pulled up I asked them what they were looking at and they described it to me just as I had seen it!  They said that it took off and went straight up into the air and then it was gone. It was a very long night for me, indeed.  I told a few friends and my husband (a skeptic) and I don&#39;t want to experience it ever again.  I did not have a good feeling about the experience at all.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Report will be forwarded to Dave Marler, IL State Director/MUFON, for possible follow-up.  PD))<n>

I remember checking the NUFORC website reports after witnessing a similar object in the same area as described by the individual in the report dated 03/29/00. In my situation, I had just come off of the Mt.Rose Hwy and were headed south on 395. Looking south I was startled by the intensity of an object floating over the foothills (between Steamboat and Washoe). It produced a very bright, equally radiating white light and moved slowly over the hills until it seemed to simply fall from the sky, in the same manner in which an object might roll off a ledge then drop. That&#39;s it. Short lived yet spectacular.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The other incident was posted 08/18/00 from a gentleman in Gerlach in which he describes 3 seperated objects flying in a triangular pattern, north to south. I&#39;m not sure of the exact dates, but on a couple of occasions in July and August of 2000 I observed 2 individual objects from my home in Steamboat (just south of Gerlach) that paralleled each other and traveled north to south. In checking several websites I found that what I probably saw at the time were the Space Shuttle and the MIR Space Station. Whether or not there was a third object possibly rotated in a non-reflective position ... who knows?<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date and time are approximate.  PD))<n>

Blinky first appears to look like a star, and as descends he gets brighter, hovers for a few seconds, then ascends almost straight up and dims out. On some occasions, 3 times over the last 2 weeks, Blinky hovers over what appears to be a cell phone tower in the western sky. Then slowly leaves over Lookout Mountain, to the west. On 8-18-00, after Blinky made his appearance, we had a very strange lightening storm. No rain, no wind, no thunder, just constant flashes over about an hour, coming from one small cloud in the southern sky. This included ball lightening. Looked like a fireworks show coming from this one small cloud that remained motionless. We nicknamed him &#34;Blinky&#34; before we found out he already has the nickname &#34;Bubba&#34;. He is real regular, always on time, and does pretty much the same maneuvers. He looks just like the videos of Bubba that are on SkyNet.

Our first guess would be that the object is a celestial body, but they do not move in the manner described.  We doubt whether the object is related to the storm activity cited, but that is a presumption.  UFO&#39;s generally do not appear in one area so frequently that they are given names by the locals.

Evening was very hot 92 and humid, very hazy. We had windows up AC blasting and music, loud as we were heading E on Barrancas to approach Barrancas bridge where the radio tower becomes visible. Barrancas Y&#39;s here. A large black chevron passes over tower and I say to my daughters are you guys seeing this. It heads S a bit about width of Barrancas and spins like a boomerang. Van in front of us is swerving a little so I decrease my speed as by this time we are on bridge ramp. We wonder are they watching it, too. It flys over us and we watch as it flys over the 2 other radio towers that are on Pace which intersects bridge. I noticed just a little bit of static. This bridge has a good deal of pedestrian traffic, so I noticed a mother and son running across bridge most people don&#39;t run across this bridge as it is very scenic. What made me notice this thing were the lights and it was low.<n>

Upon watching it we noticed that it was not moving across the sky but was changing directions rapidly, going in circles, going in every direction much like the beam from a laser pointer when aimed at a wall.  It was very high up as it went behind clouds and was about as bright as a star.  We watched it until a cloud bank moved in and covered our view of it. I have seen satelites and space unk as it moved across the sky and am sure that it was niether seeing it stayed in the same area above us for the 2 hours we observed it. I am very curious what this may have been and any knowledge on this would be greatly appreciated THank You<n>

Object appeared to be cigar shaped because of my viewing position. The object was bright white, like a flouresent light and was approximately 200 feet long. I watched the object for approximately 15 seconds, before it shot straight up at a high rate of speed, approximately 5 thousand more feet. When the object shot up and stopped, it bobbed up and down a few times,like a fishing bobber that has poped up from under water.I viewed the object for approximately 15 more seconds at which time it shot up at a high rate speed at an 85 degree angle.Approximately 10 seconds later an aircraft flew into view at approximately the same height as the object had been. It seemed to me the the object left because of the approaching aircraft.The object did not make a sound during my observation.The aircraft could plainly be heard.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

On several (6 or 7 times)  i have seen what a ppres to be 3 or 4 bright lights streak across the sky.  The first time I thought that they were comets or metors of some sorts, but as i thought about it, they were following each other.  I live out in the country, away from the city lights. so i get a pretty good view of the sky.  The next time was about 3 days later, this time there were more going in the same direction  s.s.e. very fast high in the sky.  The next time was on October11th.  This time they stopped in the middle of the sky, and they were much lower.  I could see that they were more of a craft than a shape.  one of them had very definded areas while the other ones were small.  Still they were very far away.  But while they were stopped i could not help but think that they were lookin at me.  The last time, 10/14/00 , And this is what promted me to tell this story, I saw only one streak the stay, but it turned around and went back the same way that it had came, without missing a beat.  About three min later i was headed down HWY N towards I94 when three crafts, rather small, came up from behind the car, vanished, and reappeard about 1 mile down the raod.  Usually this road is busy in the am, but one one seemed to be around, which really creeped me out.  I slowed the car down and stopped.  Each had a beam of light, one to my left, one the right, and one that when from the ground through my car up and down.  none of these lights were terribly bright, and i think that they were white or gray in color. Or it was a blue light.  The middle one seemed to control the others movements as it moved.  It also had a haze or glow to it that the others did not.  The middle one was about the size of a Large SUV and the shpae was almost that of a craft that something could sit in. It was almost like a TV set, large on one side and a bit smaller on the other, but it did nt look like a tv. It did not have any doors or windows, and no visible power source.  It had One oth! er light that was directly beneith the craft. The other two were more of a circle or globe with the tops smaller than the rest.  They were plaon in color and moved when the middle one did.   Just then, I saw a car approaching from the rear.  They simply went straight up and returned to the course they had been taking.?????? I have not seen them scince, but most times take another route to work just to be safe.  Sometimes i forget and feel real spooked driving down that road.<n>

8/17/00 10:24|NJ Turnpike (near Exit 11)|NJ|Sphere|30 seconds|A fast moving silver ball following the New Jersey Turn Pike|8/19/00|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/013/S13817.html|113|ndxe200008| A fast moving silver ball following the New Jersey Turn Pike<n> <n><n> <n><n> I work for a moving company and was driving on the New Jersey Turnpike this morning with a co-worker. Everytime we pass Newark airport, we watch the planes land and take off , sometimes we get a really good view. We were watching the planes land and come in as I passed the airport. As we traveled we saw a few more planes coming in, like always from off in the distance- no big deal. As we got near exit 11 going south I saw the sun glint off another plane in the distance and looked away. It was traveling north toward us to the left of the north bound lanes. It glinted again so I looked at it. Another plane I thought. As we got closer I thought oh, its a helicopter. As I looked I could see it was round in front but it didnt look right. As we got closer I started asking myself in my mind, &#39;What the !@$%#@! is that? &#39; It was just a big round silver ball. After thinking this about twice I said outloud ,&#34;Bob, what the !$#@! is that??? &#34; I was surprised to hear my own voice in a igh pitch to. He was staring at it to. It was round like a ball and silver and about -he said three miles to our left- I think it was closer about two miles away. It just kept traveling toward us and passed us on the left moving faster than any plane we have ever seen going to Newark airport.  I was driving, and as it passed us on the left I got a real good view. It was silver and round about the size of a helicopter- there were no windows- lights- nothing on it at all and heres the part that got us , it moved in a perfect straight line as it traveled -no wobble- no up or down no side to side or spinning motions. It just went straight. There was no noise no smoke nothing. To us it looked to be made of a solid metal,it glisted real bright from the sun off in the distance which first got our attention- Bob said thats when it turned- I didn&#39;t see it turn. Right after we say it the radio had static on it - we were listening to CBS 101.1 FM. I didn&#39;t pay much attentio to this because of what we saw. Bob said he saw it glint and watched it and it turned to go north following the NJTP. I saw it glint and took my eyes off of it and only saw it go in a straight line after watcing it after the second glint. We agreed that it was up about 2000 feet and the only clouds were way off in the distance far away. The sun was out and the sky was very clear. So it moved about five to seven miles toward us in a straight line followig the NJTP going north. The whole event lasted about 30 seconds or so. When I first saw it we must have been doing about 60 mph -I know I slowed down during the event but probably didnt go under 50 mph.  We both had the same thoughts - its a plane - no its a helicopter- what is it???? I looked at the time and it read 10:24 (AM) right after this happened. Allot of people had to see this thing. The NJTP was packed as usual and the sky was perfect. This thing was going much faster than the planes that go to Newark airport . Maybe you can contact someone and see if it was picked up on radar. A few minutes after the event I thught it might have been some type of ballon. But - could a balloon travel that fast?? And the part that reall gets me! Can a ballon  travel at &#39;helicopter level&#39; in a perfectly straight line? I mst have watched it travel for several miles and thought it was an aircraft until it got within a mile or so. I know other people saw this. If its a government device - I say this because it followed the northbound lane the way cruise missles followed highways during the Gulf war - why did they test it under clear skys during the day i such a very busy area? And there was a plane coming in not to long after it- I bet they saw it to.<n>

I tryed to report this to the local police, but they said that they couldn&#39;t see any thing. From the city of Redding you probably wouldn&#39;t be able to see it because of the city lights.

(it is a large empty lot where some go sight seeing)both of us got goosebumps and he had jumped up and said &#34;we need to get out of here right now. go go!&#34; we grabbed the blanket and began running towards his car which was parked across the street. the object had yellow lights flashing around it and as i looked back to see where it had gone i watched the object flash once a small yellow light and then flash again a bigger one and completely dissapeared in thin air.. with size of the object and how lit it was neither of us could explain it.we got in the car and drove home as fast as we could , we watched the sky but had not seen anything else after the bigger one dissapeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It appeared to be going down then there was a flash in the sky. I went to get abetter look ans saw that there was emergency vehicles heading towrds where it appeared to have gone. I also saw several airplanes flying around, I would say there was about 4 to 5 different aircraft flying around. This happend in a small town about 40 miles from Salt Lake City. It was weird.

It was close to the horizon. It was a bright yellowish/golden coloured light. The intensity of the light varied - at its brightest it far brighter than the brightest. It appeared to be flashing its light sometimes. I thought, at first, that it must be an aircraft. Initially it was not moving - so it was not an aircraft. Then it started moving in different directions - sometimes in a wavy fashion. It moved sideways, up, down and the motion seemed random. Many time it just became stationery. Suddenly it dissappeared. After about a minute it re-appeared and the same sequence was repeated at the end I saw another light similar to it and then both dissappeared again. I am a computer software engineer and this incident happened between 22:05 and 22:10 IST on 16 August 2000.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We are always grateful for reports that arrive from overseas!  It adds to the enjoyment we derive from making UFO data available to the world&#39;s population.<n> <n><n> The report is somewhat reminiscent of a twinkling star, but that would not explain why the objects would disappear from sight.  The test would be if the objects appeared on subsequent nights. If not, they were not stars.  PD))<n>

I grabed my binocculars and looked only to see a big round object that was shooting out rays of golden light at the bottom in morse code style.  I started to go get my video camera and had a strong feeling not to at that moment the craft moved up a little higher real fast.  The sky was clear temp, 78 in the shade wind calm and high altitude not to far away from the sun was the craft. I observed it for about 3 minutes or more.  It would stop hover, move up when i directed my thoughts toward it.  Finally it gave a steady pulsating of light from the bottom and went stright up and blanked out completly. Just before it disappered the rays of light went from morse code style to a fast steady pulsating.  It was overhead in our town.<n>

Love Filed airport is not far away so the majority of the planes in the sky are assending or descending, so scalability of airplane size is not hard to fathom. We were facing southeast looking southeast on the patio at a local restaur 21:44 CST.  glancing at the sky above the the adjacent table, I noticed the craft heading west. The sun had not set all the way so the craft could be seen fairly well. Its texture didn&#39;t appear any differant than the materials made for modern aircraft,and not unlike typical flying saucer materials.The size of the craft was misleading because it seemed to big to be that low in the sky. My mind could not make out it relationship to it distance in respect to its size.. It seemed to me for an instant first a small plane seen upclose, , then seemed to appear like a helicopter, probably my mind making up for the differance in size to as were it should have been. As the idea of it being a meteor started to cross my mind, my reflexes, already fired, was already thrusting my pointing finger to the sky as the craft employed some sort of energy device and increased it speed incredibly. what appeared to be the back of the craft, lit up with a white light. The light was not the light typical of lights on planes but was more akin to a white flash, white hot like a welders torch. The white flash was produced in an area rectangular in shape, with even distribution of the white light. The craft skipped forward at high speed and disappeared,Hyperspace style. As its engines ignited I shouted UFO and my associate witnessed the speed increase, skipping, and disappearance. We agreed that the white light was not similar to the break-up of a meteor or its falling deris.<n>

We stopped the car, and watched it for a period of time. The object seemed to hover about the skyline of Little Rock. At first I thought it was the top of a building, but being an amateur Ufologist I looked more closely. I realized that this couldn&#39;t have been a builing cause it was higher than the tallest building in Little Rock. My little brother thought it was a blimp, but it wasn&#39;t even moving at at all. And since when do blimps have a string of lights arounf them??? We left after a minute or 2 and went home. I came back a minute later considering I only lived a couple blocks away, from where we saw it. And it was gone. If it was a blimp, then I would surely have seen it in the horizon somewhere else, butit was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date corrected to 08/15/00 at request of witness.  PD))<n>

ON THE EVENING OF AUGUST 15TH 2000 JUST  SHORTLY AFTER SUNSET I WATCH THE SKY FOR A BRITISH AIRLINE 747 JET THAT GOES OVER MY HOUSE EVER NIGHT ABOUT THE SAME TIME 8:00 PM TO 8:15 PM I&#39;M VERY IMPREESED WITH THE 747 JET BEING SO BIG AND CAN TRAVEL ACROSS THE SKY AT SUCH A SLOW SPEED AND VERY LOW OVER MY BACK YARD. SKYHARBOR AIRPORT IN PHOENIX AZ. IS APPROIMATELY 25 MILES NORTHWEST OF ME. JETS THAT COME IN FROM THE WEST COAST PASS SKYHARBOR AIRPORT ON THE SOUTH SIDE. AS THEY GET READY TO SET UP FOR THEIR FINAL APPROACH THEY ARE HEADING EAST PAST THE AIRPORT. THEY BANK TO THE LEFT EVEN WITH MY BACKYARD. THEY START HEADING NORTH THEN BANK LEFT ONCE AGAIN HEADING BACK WEST TOWARDS THE AIRPORT ON THEIR FINAL APPROACH. THEY DROP DOWN FROM ABOUT 15,000 TO 8,000 FEET AT THIS POINT. WELL ON THE EVENING OF THE 15TH OF AUGUST RIGHT IN THE FLIGHT PATH WERE THESE JETS TURN I AND THE WIFE NOTICED TWO BRIGHT RED LIGHTS IN THE SKY NORTH TO NORTHEAST AT 8:15PM THEY WERE THE SIZE OF GOLF BALLS ABOUT 5,000 TO 6,000 FEET HIGH AND ABOUT 3 TO 4 MILES AWAY. THESE TWO LIGHTS JUST SAT THERE FOR 5 MINUTES JUST HOVERING. IF YOU WERE LOOKING AT A CLOCK ONE OF THE LIGHTS WAS AT TWELVE (12) AND THE OTHER AT FIVE (5). I LOOKED AT THESE BRIGHT RED LIGHTS THROUGH MY BINOCULARS THAT ARE 7X50 FIELD STRENGTH. AFTER THE FIRST 5 MINUTES ONE OF THE BRIGHT RED LIGHTS STARTED TO FLICKER THEN IT TURNED COLOR FROM BRIGHT RED TO A VERY BRIGHT AMBER COLOR WHILE IT WAS FLICKERING. BUY THE TIME YOU CAN COUNT OFF THREE SECONDS THAT LIGHT HAD DISAPPEARED VERY FAST IN A DOWN WARD AND EAST DERECTION. WITHIN THE NEXT FEW MINUTES THE REMAINING BRIGHT RED LIGHT ALSO STARTED FLICKERING AND IT TO TURNED COLOR FROM BRIGHT RED TO BRIGHT AMBER COLOR. AND ONCE AGAIN WITH IN A FEW SECONDS IT WAS GONE. AT 8:35 PM I HAD CALLED SKYHARBOR AIRPORT IN PHOENIX AZ.(602)273-3311 TALKED TO SOME GENTELMEN AND ASKED IF HE HAD GOTTEN ANY REPORTS OF THESE RED LIGHTS 25 MILES EAST OF THE AIRPORT. HE HAD TOLD ME HE HASN&#39;T HEARD ANYTHING ABOUT THE! SE LIGHT S IN THE SKY. NOTHING HAS BEEN REPORTED. SO I THEN CALLED THE TV NEWS STATION CHANNEL 10 IN PHOENIX AZ. THE REPORTER THAT I TALKED WITH HAD TOLD ME THAT THEY HAVE BEEN RECEIVING SWARMS OF CALLS ABOUT THESE RED LIGHTS OVER GILBERT ARIZONA. THE REPORT ALSO TOLD ME THAT HE HAD CALLED THE MESA ARIZONA POLICE DEPARTMENT. THEY TOLD THE REPORTER THAT THOSE LIGHTS ARE A MILITARY EXERCISE USING FALCON HELICOPTERS. THEN ON THE NEXT DAY AUGUST 16TH CHANNELS 3,10,12,15 NEWS TV BROADCAST ALL RAN THE STORY ABOUT RED LIGHTS OVER GILBERT AZ. ON 8/15/00 THEY HAD REPORTED THAT EVEN SOME PILOTS LANDING THEIR AIRCRAFT HAD ASKED THE TOWER WHAT WERE THOSE RED LIGHTS. A FEW PEOPLE EVEN GOT TO VIDEO THE LIGHTS. AND NOTHING SHOWED UP ON RADAR WITH THREE OR FOUR DIFFERENT AIRPORTS THROUGHOUT THE VALLEY. THE MILITARY STATED THERE WERE NO EXERCISES TAKING PLACE AT 8:15 PM ON 8/15/00  THEN WE SAW ANOTHER SIGHTING ON SUNDAY 8/20/2000 IN THE SAME DIRECTION BUT THIS ONE WAS IN THE DAY LIGHT HOURS 4:10 PM UNTIL 4:20 PM IT WAS A WHITE LIGHT IN THE NORTH TO NORTHEAST SKY BUT IT WAS ABOUT ONE MILE HIGH.THE SHAPE WAS LIKE A THIMBEL IT WAS TURNING COLOR FROM WHITE TO YELLOW BACK TO WHITE FOR THE FULL 10 MINUTES AND JUST HOVERING IN ONE SPOT NEVER MOVED.THEN IT STARTED VERY FAST OUT TO THE EAST SKY. I HAD VIEWED THIS UFO THROUGH MY BINOCULARS WHICH BRINGS ITEMS SEVEN TIMES CLOSER.IT WASN&#39;T A JET OR WEATHER BALOON JUST SITTING IN THE SAME SPOT FOR 10 MINUTES BEFORE IT&#39;S FAST DEPARTURE.<n>

Both objects floated west. A couple of airliners on final approach to the local airport were also in the area below the objects. There was no sound associated with them. As they moved due south, the second object released a smaller flickering red light that appeared to fall to the ground, and disappeared.  The first object continued west for about another minute, also released a a smaller flicjering red light, and then disappeared.  This was seen from a normal housing area, temp approx. 95-100 degrees, with light cloud formations.<n>

Object B was about 30 degrees above the horizon and 1 degree or so to the west.  My wife went into the house.  Their lights seemed to radiant in the cardinal directions of N, NE, SE, S, SW, W, SW.   They appeared stationary. Civilian aircraft passed beneath them and one aircraft passed at a high altitude.  Upon the passing of the higher altitude aircraft object A&#39;s lights pulsed and it seemed to go upward.  My wife came back outside and we observed object A moving to the south at an extremely high rate of speed.  Object B remained in position for about 3 to 4 minutes more.  Then another two aircraft passed underneath object B. Object B pulsed similar to object A and went straight up and disappeared.  I took a couple of photographs of both objects. My background is military, combat veteran. I have observed helicopter, ground attack aircraft, fighters, and high altitude bombers as well as transport aircraft of all types  I have never witnessed anything like this.

One started pulsing and dropped low in the sky and disappeared.  The other one kept moving overhead and then just disappeared.  It appeared that the air traffic was coming very close to these objects and that the objects were in the flight path.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Many other reports of this phenomenon during the months of July and August, three of them from the same witness who reported this sighting.

A couple of planes came towards them, then they seemed to close the distance between them. The higher one then seemed to shoot something out of the top of it, then flashed as it dropped rapidly and blinked out. The remaining one then dimmed for a couple of seconds, then from our view, a plane seemed to come close and changed direction to avoid it. It then blinked out. I recorded almost 10 min. of these lights. This is the second time I have recorded these lights around the same time. No moon out at the time ( or it was behind clouds ). One also seemed to have another light (small white) above and to the left of the higher red light. There was no sound associated with these lights.<n>

Ufo probes maybe?<n> <n><n> <n><n> My wife and I were sitting on our back patio watching the sun set and observing planes. It was between 6:30 and 7:30 P.M. I&#39;m not sure of the time. Anyway I was trying to see a plane my wife had pointed out to me when I saw a black dot moving east to west. At first I thought it was a black coloured &#34;party&#34; balloon that some kid might have let go of, but I didn&#39;t see any string underneath and it seemed more like a circle or a dot in shape and not an oval like a child&#39;s balloon. Also it was moving fast in a perfect straight line like a plane and just as fast. It wasn&#39;t bouncing or bobbing at all in the breeze like small helium balloons do. It was definetely moving as fast as a jet plane because there were some planes in other parts of the sky and I could compare the speed. I couldn&#39;t tell how big it was or how high it was but it didn&#39;t seem like it was far away. Maybe a quarter of a mile away, I don&#39;t know. There was no light or reflection coming from it at all. It was solid dull black. I couldn&#39;t see any characteristics at all. Its hard to explain but I think it would have just looked like a dull black circle or ball if it was just feet away from me. It moved in a straight, fast, perfect trajectory like it was under intelligent control. I lost sight of it behind our row of houses so I went to the front of the house so I could see it again. It went out of sight pretty quick and became so small I couldn&#39;t make it out anymore. Just then an identical black dot came from the same direction as the other one had and moved in the exact same fashion and trajectory. I watched this one until it too flew out of sight in the eastern sky. My wife and I kept saying, &#34;What the hell is that?&#34; Anyway I watch planes every night from my patio and I&#39;ve seen many hot air balloons as well as helium party balloons and I can tell you it wasn&#39;t any of those.<n>

I have not said anything publicly for almost 40 years but with the wealth of information you have I thought it might prove useful, perhaps to corroborate some other sightings. I am sorry I cannot give you a date. It has been too long. The way it acted might prove useful.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I filled in a date on the form so it would go through but it was 1969 to 1971 in Beaumont, Texas.  It was Summer and in the afternoon, I think it was a Sunday but I am not sure. It was clear and sunny. I was on interstate 10 heading west, which is actually south on this section of the highway in Beaumont. The sighting was to my right or towards the west. This is what occurred.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I saw a shiny object darting in the sky. It was so unique I pulled onto the side of the road as the road rose over Highway 90. To my left was Gateway Shopping center. I pulled up behind two or three other cars that had also pulled over to watch. Another car pulled over behind me. We all got out and stood watching. The object flew between points very rapidly (I mean almost instantly) and then hovered. It flew in a square or rectangular pattern moving out Highway 90 toward Houston. It overlapped itself and worked farther and farther away. If I had to guess, I would say it was coming back about half way each time it made the return leg on my left. Anyway, it moved much farther away on my right than it returned on my left. My first thought was that it was mapping or surveying. It flew this pattern until it simply was too far away to see anymore. It took a long time. It is hard to say because I did not time it but it must have been ten or twenty minutes before it was too far away to see.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It stopped at each corner for only ten or fifteen seconds, as it flew the grid centered over Highway 90, so each square took one minute or less. It flew 15 or twenty of these that were visible after I stopped. It was impossible to tell how high, how far away or how large it was. There was absolutely no scale to work with.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was not like a light. It was the sun reflecting off something but I cannot say what shape it was. I doubt that it was long unless pointing away from me. The light was concentrated instead of spread out.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We watched together without speaking, at least not from one group to the other, and when it was over, we shrugged at each other, got in our cars and drove away. I hope this is useful. Once you have seen one, you wonder why everyone tries so hard to deny them. We still do not have anything that can do what this craft did and it did not seem to be a threat.<n> <n><n> <n><n> You asked for info on me. I am 54, owned a supply company for over twenty years and I am now a full time college student. I am an Environmental Science major at Lamar University in Beaumont, Texas and I think I was a student at Lamar when this sighting occurred (Either that or a senior in high school). I have a fairly high IQ and no reason to fake this. There is nothing to gain from this.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It would be nice to find out if others reported something similar. I have never seen or heard of anything similar.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))<n>

NOT A DRAMATIC SIGHTING, I ALMOST DIDN&#39;T BOTHER TO REPORT IT, BUT FOR ALL I KNOW MAYBE OTHERS SAW IT AND REPORTED IT ALSO. THANK YOU PETER DAVENPORT FOR ALL YOUR HARD WORK AND DEDICATION.

I usually watch airplanes flying into Sydney airport from my vantage point, so I waited to see what type of craft it was and realised it wasn&#39;t moving at all, and was way higher than any plane usually is in this area.  I moved around to make sure it wasn&#39;t a dot on my eye or anything but it stayed in its location. I know sattelites aren&#39;t visible in daytime and it was too high and spherical to be a blimp.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I watched for as long as I could before finally having to return to work, having stared at this single unmoving point in the sky for at least ten minutes longer than my allowed workbreak, just waiting to see it move.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I never saw it move, and never saw it again afterward.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

Strange<n> <n><n> <n><n> A co-worker and myself first spotted a dot way up in the sky as we were building a deck on a new house in Martha&#39;s Vineyard. I looked out at the beautiful day as we always did from this beach front property, not a cloud in the sky. As I was taking in our surroundings I looked almost straight up following a hawk that lived in the tree next to our deck, as I did I saw this dot in the sky I stopped for about 30 to 40 seconds which made my co-worker ask what I was looking at and I said to him &#34;can you see that up there&#34;? He replied yeah that little spot and I said something to the affect that &#34;wow it isn&#39;t moving at all&#34; and he agreed. We kept an eye on it as time went by and told others as they came into our area everyone noticed it and that&#39;s when things began to get strange because we all agreed it was something big but it was so far up that we could not make it out. Not one of us wanted to blurt out the dreaded UFO phrase but I had to because this thing was bugging me now. We would go back to work for a while and stop to look up and it stayed there. Finally luch time arrived and we all took a look as we made the lunch list and at almost noon time to the second this thing just began to drop straight down and it looked round and silver before we noticed that it headed east at a clip unreconisable to me, it moved so fast as we all watched it leave. The five of us just amazed at this point agreed we had just witnessed a UFO and knowing there wasn&#39;t a thing we could do about it we continued our work and told everyone on the island what we had seen. A women from Chillmark that worked at the local restaurant also saw this object in the sky so I know were not crazy.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of the event is approximate.

The fellow said there is a hill, which is at the highest point in the city on Belmont Avenue. On the hill there is a large condo complex which is 12 to 14 stories in height. On top of the complex there are microwave and cell phone towers. From the witnesses position, looking toward the condo complex he saw a strange object flying close to the top of the complex. (He said if people would have been looking out there windows they would have had this object pass right in front of their faces). He described the object as looking like an ordinary florescent tube, square on both ends, maybe slightly rounded (ends) and a pale yellow orange glow in color.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was traveling in a flat trajectory and just &#34;zipped&#34; by, traveling at an incredible rate of speed right at the top of the building. The witness noted the same object passed by the building twice within ten minutes in exactly the same spot. At this point he said his heart was thumping rather hard due to what he just saw. Each time the object was noticed the sighting lasted maybe for about 2 seconds. He figured it was approx: the length of a city bus.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thank you to the witness for the report.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Brian Vike, Director HBCC UFO Research Canadian Toll Free UFO Hotline 1 866 262 1989 - Free call.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Editor: Canadian Communicator - Paranormal Magazine email: hbccufo@telus.net Website: http://www3.telus.net/public/wilbur8/hbcc_ufo_research.htm<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We express our gratitude to Brian Vike for submitting not only this report, but many others, as well.

I was driving down one of the major roads that connects Ft Oglethorpe to Ringgold.  I noticed a ball of light moving across the sky...it was too fast and low to be a plane, and too slow to be a falling star. I watched the light move across the sky, it started to disappear behind some tree tops, but made a huge U-turn back toward me. As it turned, I noticed it had 2 lights on it, so I thought maybe it was some kind of plane. I ignored it and kept going, I had to yield to change roads, so I watched the sky again to see if it was still there. When I looked at it again, I saw it alot closer and it had 3 white colored lights, two larger ones on the sides, and one in the middle, a little higher up than the side ones, it also had a small red flashing light in between the three white ones. It was hovering in the air above a house while I was stopped. I turned onto the other road and hightailed it home.  I kept looking back to see if it was anywhere to be seen...but I didn&#39;t see it.  As I neared my driveway, I put my turn signal on,and came to a stop, I looked up and the aircraft was directly above my driveway. I could clearly see the three lights and the flashing light at that time, and it looked as if it had some kind of reflective checkerboard pattern on the bottom if it, it was a blue and red reflective kind of pattern. I stopped my car at the top of my driveway and watched the craft as it made it&#39;s way across the sky.....directly over my driveway, slowing at the top of my car, and creeping off over my house until it disappeared into the darkness. I waited in my car for a few minutes to make sure it was gone, and ran inside... haven&#39;t seen it since then...  There isn&#39;t much background to tell you about me, I don&#39;t do drugs, hadn&#39;t been drinking, wasn&#39;t tired, so it wasn&#39;t in my mind.  I just want to know what it was....and how it knew where I lived.<n>

We had a nice view of the valley pointing south and of Red Top look out. Our tent was a three person tent. our car was parked about  8 feet away from the door of out tent and our two dogs were in the car that night. The tent door was facing the small hill away from the view. The stars were out and the moon was almost half and located to the back of the tent away from the door side. We were sleeping with our heads to the back of the tent. I was on my back. I happened to wake up as i normally do. As soon as i opened my eyes there was a round bright white light on the centered part of the door to the tent. The light was perfectly round with fine edges and solid white.  It was there about 10 secounds, and went out. I layed there about 20 secounds and it came on again, same location and intencity. It stayed on about the time it took me to just out my bag, about 4 secounds.  I open the tent door and stuck my head out and looked all over, the hill the sky and saw nothing. I didn`t look behind the tent toward the valley, because it was cold and i already had chills going up my spine.  I ruled out the moon reflecting off the mirror of my car and my flash light in the tent was positioned not to shine on that area.  As far as time lost i don`t know. I was asleep and woke up that.  Dogs did not make any sounds at all. The wife slept right through it all.  We came back the next year same weekend and did not have any sightings. Oh there were two big deer on the hill with us, up in the trees.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

They each slowly moved down, then to the right and back up. The whole time they were moving in this pattern they stayed lined up in the perfect triangle formation.

A storm system was quickly moving in from the west to the south.  Because I had been watching the sunset, I was wearing sunglasses.  They are non-reflective, but they amplify anything that is red.  As I watched the progress of the storm, I saw a translucent red sphere appear to streak from south to west; disappearing behind a cloud.  I thought it was a simple reflection off the lenses, so I removed them and looked again.  I saw the globe drop out from behind one cloud, travel straight down, and take cover behind another cloud.  This behavior continued for about ten minutes, until the storm moved closer to me and I was forced to go inside.  I live near several airports, and a military base, but this was unlike anything I have seen before.<n>

It moved west, horizontally for three or four seconds.  The area it occupied began below Phecda (Ursa Major) and moved slightly past Canes Venatici.  The shape was hard to describe.  At first, I thought it was a plane.  My neighborhood lies below a flight path so there is always a lot of air traffic, especially at night.  I do, however, know the difference between a plane and something that is not.  This object was about twice the size of an airplane and three times as bright.  The shape seemed spherical, with a bright golden aura surrounding it.  The center was the brightest, a deep gold/light orange.  There was no trail or dust following it.  The reason it caught my eye was because it accelerated in its speed.  The best way to describe its disappearance was that it slipped into an invisible pocket in the sky.  I am reporting this because I KNOW it was not an airplane and I was wondering if anyone else saw it.  I really would like to know what it was.  I see movement in the sky every night, but nothing ever like this and as bright as this.<n>

But we find out that was the movement of this flyer objects. We took the film and we adjust to the maximum zoom of 300 and finally we find out when we look out it on the television and the VCR into a slow motion. Was amazing how they move like in zig-zag and waving motion some when up on diagonal direction and some came down straight. We adjust the color to a darker gray the TV and we see it very clearly the Ovnies shape. Since then I believe that we are not alone in this world.

St. Helena when we saw pair of bright stationary lights above trees against cloudless full moon sky. Craft did not move for 40 seconds. Pulled off to side of road. As soon as we stopped, craft moved towards us..approx. four stories above us. As we got out of car, craft went over our heads, emanating a low humming sound/vibration. It was triangular with six or more white lights constituting the shape of the triangle and a red and green light in the middle.  Next, the craft slowly moved over us accross valley, turned all red, crossed valley in southerly direction, then moved east along mountain ridge, then disappeared behind trees. We got back in car and drove futher up mountain. Pulled over again, looking accross valley floor and saw several more lights moving along ridge, some east-bound, some west, changing colors from red blinking to white, disappearing, reappearing, swelling and contracting and moving spasticly.  Suddenly, another craft of same appearance as first- but much closer- moved directly over our heads. We were calm, excited and in awe. Craft moved out over valley joining other ones.  Some seemed to be circling back toward us at higher altitude and further away. Later, one- and then another- went over our head at slightly higher altitude than first two. We continued to watch many crafts moving on opposite side of valley. We are questioning whether we lost some time... some confusion...very surreal.<n>

It was moving straight across the sky very slowly. Slow from our perspective, but probably traveling extremely fast, just far away. My friends instantly saw this as well. We decided it was a satellite and continued to watch it when suddenly, it changed course and headed downward, completely about face from the course it was heading. At this point about ten seconds had passed. then it began to move horizontally in a jerky start-stop motion. coming to complete stops with no gradual slow downs. next it began to make jerky half circle motions, clockwise then counterclockwise visa-versa etc as it travelled on its path. it made occasional complete circles. it continued these unpredictable course changes periodically and  continued its bizzare loops and dashes. untill it appeared to become almost stationary far on the opposite side of the sky from where it had started. nearly five minutes had passed...that is an agreed upon esitmate. we watched for about ten more minutes or so...occasionally it moved...we were more or less freaking out trying to rationalize what we had just seen and at the same time trying to calm down one of my friends who was already 10 minutes late for her curfew. the two girls I was with were basically hysterical as they fed off eachother&#39;s fear. i really wanted to stay and watch in case something else happened but my friend had to be home for her curfew( it was now about 2:40 am) and she was the one driving us around so i had to go. I was dropped of at my car where i raced to my home 20 minutes away and woke up my parents to come look for what i had seen. They were not amused. I watched the sky from my backyard for about another hour and gave up. this was no airplane or meteo! rite. it was a faint, blue dot in the sky doing the most amazing maneuvers i have ever seen. once again i emphasize how it changed course directions instantly and jumped about in the sky. what would do this i ask? i have never been a believer nor skeptic towards UFOS. I am convinced someone else out there besides my friends and I saw this, for it couldnt have happened on a more observed night than a meteor shower like this one. I wish I wish i could give points of reference like constellations, stars and directional coordiantes..but im totally clueless when it comes to those types of things.  I was referred to this site from somebody in a UFO chatroom on aol where i went looking for other people who may have seen this. And yes we were all entirely sober.<n>

It was Friday or Saturday, August 11 or 12.  Around 10:00 p.m. I went outside and stood in our driveway and watched the sky for Perseid meteors.  Unfortunately, the moon was shining in the south sky and then a few puffy clouds came in from the north.  However, I was still able to see a few faint meteors and quite a few satellites pass overhead between the patches of clouds.  It was nearly 11:00 pm and I was about to give up and go inside.  Some clouds started to cover the moon and it got a little darker, so thinking that my chances of seeing some meteors would be better, I decided to wait a little longer.  I looked up in the western sky (the big dipper was a little to the right) and saw something move so fast, I thought my eyes were playing tricks on me.  I was more or less facing west and looking up to about 60 to 70 degrees above the horizon.  This thing zipped into my line of sight in a straight line from the right (north) to almost directly overhead.  It made an immediate 90-degree change in direction, no delay at all; like a billiard ball bouncing off the side of a pool-table, and then zipped to the east and disappeared in the clouds.  The sighting lasted only 2 seconds!  It was oval shaped and flat; not shiny, and dark gray. There were no lights or sound.  It was nearly the same color as the dark gray clouds against the black sky.  I think it was above the clouds.  And it was huge.  It was the size of my thumbnail held at arm&#39;s length! I didn&#39;t see it approach from the horizon.  It just came out of nowhere all of a sudden and then disappeared.  I<n>

I ran inside to get the binoculars and when I came out it was gone ! Then in the corner of my eye coming over the horizon I saw 2 more of them, I ran inside to get Mum &amp; Dad, and when I came back out the objects where several thousand feet in the air ! I looked through the binoculars and saw a shape that I will never forget, I could not see it very clearly though, but I saw what I saw, The thing that made me not think that it was a hot-air ballon was that they climbed altitude very quickly and moved fast then stopped then moved slowly, and they stayed the exact same distance apart !!! I went inside of the house and didnt come back out, I was to scared.<n>

I am a Police Officer and the following week, I believe on August 15th, callers reported seeing red lights in East Mesa and we were given this information on our car computers.

It came back. I was first alerted by a local from Gilbert that it was out. I was already recording tape but in the wrong direction of the sky. It took less than a minute to record the red UFO. This was higher in elevation than I&#39;ve seen before. I was just outside 2 minutes before the phone rang and saw nothing. The surveilance camera had the area videotaped were it should of came from. So I guess it just appears in the sky. Again I shot more 80x to 100x video of this object. It was extremely red in color, you could see a double red lights in the viewfinder. With the naked eye could see 1 brightly lite light and a dimmer one just above it. It didn&#39;t seem to move much while looking at it directly but the videocamera revealed alot of movement. I was looking due east when I first sighted it at 8:57 pm Angle of view about 45 degrees. At the end of the sighting I was looking SE. The object was heading south and slightly ascending for about 10 minutes. Then it changed direction and started going straight up. When it got close to the cloud bank, it stopped for about 2 minutes. Hovered and moved around incredibly. Then it went up into the clouds and disappeared. The next day after talking to other spotters we determined that the object was in Chandler, about 2 miles from my house and less than 1 mile for the 3 commercial jets seen flying around it. This was one of the best sightings I had so far because it was closer to my house than any of the others so the video is much better.

The area were I live is in the foothills area so there several small hills a a two thousand foot high mountain nearby with radio and tv towerslocated on top.  Anyway this object which I had postulated as an errand weather ballooon had decended quite gently toward a cell tower which was about half mile away, I would guess it was about 4000 feet in the airnot so sure about size, but would guess about 50 feet in diameter.  Was now able to get a good look at it was gold in color with a smoke appearance to the surface. The surface had small circular endentions much like a golf ball, the afternoon sun also seem to create shadows in the indentions.  Was considering calling local airpot tower to let them know a balloon was in flight path of small aircraft, also had a concern for larger craft as the area is in partial pattern area for large craft. as I fruther watched the craft a smaller red spheer came out of it , I suppose from the back of it  out of my view anyway it circled the larger spheer in counter clockwise pattern, about five time, increasing speed with each revolution, then left in a easterly direction at the speed of a jet aircraft. At this point I asked some of the kids in the circulr area in front of our house to look at this object with me and tell me what they saw.  At that moment a white spheer came out of the object and circled around the bigger balloon-spheer , in a clockwise direction, and left in westerly direction had to be moving as fast a a F14. At this point a ran inside grabed a pair of weak binocs, came back outside just in time to see 16 small spheers emerge out and circle and leave in a easterly direction. They were dark blue or black. Upon this occurance the kids in front of our house went wow. I inspected the craft with binoculars, no protrusions or anything. Again a short time past then 16 more spheers, they left in westerly direction. following the white sphere,  The Larger spheer then slowly began to gain altitude, and left in the direction from which it came<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date is approximate.

We talked for 15 min. about the shower and best locations to watch it when I finally got off the highway from a work trip to Gold hill, OR. that day. Suddenly they in Boise started seeing lights shining from the north and it seemed to resemble manifestations of the &#34;Northern Lights&#34;. The lights started shooting out beams of light from the north over the horizon seemingly up over our heads and to the south as we all in both cities looked to the north. WE started noticing rings or bands or pulses of glowing fiant lights bands roling down from the north. They seemed to have no end in sight either east or to the west and were seem exactly at the same time in Boise as in Portland. It was 1:00 AM by now and my wife and I went down to an industral area of east Multnomah county. My wife by the way has had 1-1/2 months of coughing and resporitory distress and is now or antibiotics and getting worse all since the past months Chem-trails. Anyway we watched through the smog and days sun evaporated moisture haze lit up by all the 1:30 AM street and shopping center lights and could see clearly the pulses or waves iregularly but seemingly with some pattern radiate out fromm the north. My son and wife in Boise, ID. clearly confirmed at the same time on cell phone the pulses of faintly glowing tubes or bands of 1/2 a knuckle wide light rushing south ovewr all our heads to the south. My son Zeb and Tim my daughter-in-law have tried to record with a quality Sony digital camera and got some weak images. They are trying again Sunday morning in the clear S.W. Idaho skies and better adjust the camera to get better images of the waves. The waves or pulses sweep the full arc of the sky from north to south in 1/2 to 1 second but yet their glow was distinctly visible as they rushed across the sky in multiple patterns of waves like a code or maybe just totaly random yet it seemed to have a pattern. So going out now to check the sky. One never knows what might happen, do one? Always, ((name deleted))<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We have received several reports that appear to us to address the same phenomenon.  Our best guess is that the witnesses were observing the particularly dramatic Aurora Borrealis that occurred on this morning, and which was reportedly seen as far south as Los Angeles.  Since the solar wind, which causes the &#34;Northern Lights&#34; travels at hundreds of kilometers per second, one might expect the phenomenon to propagate very quickly across the sky when the charged particles encounter the Earth&#39;s magnetic field.

They were moving very fast across the sky from the east to the west and dissapeared over the western horizon. The entire duration was about 7 seconds. I really don&#39;t think they were meteors. I observe meteors as a hobby, i check out all the annual showers and was in Tenerife in Nov 98 for the Leonid fireball show and 99 for the fainter meteor storm so i have seen a lot.

I am a licensed pilot,an aviation historian,a UFO/paranormal researcher and am extremely well versed in the area of aircraft identification. Other witnesses included an engineer and several school teachers. All of us were attending a cave restoration camp sponsored by the park service. During a nightly stargazing session, we observed a triangular formation of three pale white lights moving at an apparent extreme high altitude at a high rate of speed. These lights gave the appearance of a dim, moving constellation or a formation of satallites. Their intensity was a little less than the surrounding stars.The lights were arranged in a perfect triangle, but moved sideways against the starfield. (imagine a flying wing moving sideways, with one wingtip as the leading edge). The objects were in view approximately 3-4 minutes, moving in a continuous arc directly overhead from north to south at the approximate same rate of speed as other man-made satellites I have observed. The formation did not waiver, change position, change color or move erratically and stars were clearly visible through the formation, giving the appearance of three vehicles, as opposed to a single solid object.I observed one object with binoculars before it was lost in the moon&#39;s glow. It appeared as a single point of light, with no apparent structure. The whole formation appeared slightly smaller than a business card held at arms length. No sounds were heard, although there were several commercial airliners in the area at the time at a much lower altitude. I am convinced that what I saw was probably unassembled U.S. space station components, the Mir Space Station , or some other type of orbital debris. However, since there was a meteor shower on the night of the observation, I am curious to know whether anyone else observed the same objects, as there were probably many people sky watching on this particular evening. Thank you for this opportunity to comment.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We believe that this may be yet another sighting of what we assume to be the U. S. Navy N.O.S.S. satellites that are reported to us from time to time.  They were first reported during the summer of 1995 or 1996, and they seem to reappear every year or two.  Mr. Terence Dickerson, journalist for the Toronto Star, investigated the phenomenon several years ago, and was perhaps the first to link the sightings to the U. S. Navy project.  PD))<n>

At the same time I saw a commercial jet pass underneath the object, which was traveling from South to North, at about 30,000 feet. I would guess the other object above the jet was 10 to 15,000 feet higher than the jet. And the object appeared to be traveling at a higher rate of speed than the jet. When I first noticed the object I thought it was a satelite. But, even though it was on a straight path it was moving slightly from side to side, kind of like a drunk driver!! I could see no other lights like running lights on regular aircraft. And the side to side movement would be impossible to perform in a standard aircraft.<n>

At first I thought I saw a plane coming in to land just ahead of me off the freeway, but it was flying way too close to nearby houses, and there was no airport nearby.  Then the object looked like it landed, but shot up in the sky, flipped around, almost in a full circle. I watched it swing out towards the fields I was driving past, then turned and seemed to CHARGE THE FREEWAY.  It was a rectangular object -- about as long as a pickup truck. It consisted of nothing but this grey strip. It had about five lights on it -- when I saw it in the distance they were white.  When it was coming towards the freeway, they were blue.  It was heading east towards my car, I thought this thing was going to run me off the road.  It was flying extremely low to the ground.  I just kept driving, and I passed it.  I was going about 70 mph.  I lost sight of it after that -- I kept driving but could see no sign of it in any of my car mirrors.  It seemed to disappear.  I looked around at the other cars on the freeway to see if anyone had seen it -- no one else stopped.  I flipped on the radio to see if anyone reported seeing the same thing.  I am unaware of any reportings. There was a heavy meteor shower that night, I saw lots of shooting stars. This happened just as it was getting dark.  When I saw it look like it was landing, it was late dusk -- by the time I had driven past it it was dark.  This thing maneuvered in ways I&#39;ve never seen aircraft be able to do -- it was definately not a plane, jet or helicoptor. Time and locations are close approximations.

They can fly in any direction, and for about fifteen minutes we watched them do so. Only once did we here any sound , a very loud boom that shook our whole church. The bride to be became very scaired and we had to take her back inside, when we returned the objects were gone. In all my 53 years I never have witnessed anything like this. (Groom) Yes this is true we did see the objects  as discribed above. We want to know if we should call the police or what should we do?<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  No other reports from Arlington for this date.

It appeared to be a baloon at times but did not  behave like one at other times. It  stayed in one spot for awhile then moved East slowly. Then appeared to change altitude and hover before moving more East.  Then it moved faster and stayed at the same elevation until it was several miles to the East of me. At this time it moved faster and higher and a little South. It went out of sight to the East of me and I was never sure that it really was a balloon. This report is to see if any one else saw it better than me  and reported it. Thank you, 9(name deleted))<n>

SEVEN MILES SOUTH OF ((town name deleted)) AND APPROX. FIVE AND THREE QUARTERS MILES WEST OF ((town name deleted)). I WENT TO THE SCENE AND WHEN I ARRIVED I SAW A MAN  WEARING A WINDSUIT LYING DIRECTLY IN THE MIDDLE OF THE ROADWAY. AS I PULLED UP HE APPEARED TO BE RUBBING HIS EYES OR HIS FOREHEAD. I STOPPED ABOUT TWENTY FEET FROM AND APPROACHED HIM. A HANDGUN WAS LYING IN A HOLSTER BESIDE HIM. I SECURED THE FIREARM IN MY TRUNK AND THEN WENT BACK TO HIM AND SPOKE TO HIM. HE DID NOT APPEAR TO KNOW I WAS THERE UNTIL AND SPOKE. HE SEEMED TO BE VERY CONFUSED. I ASKED HIM WHAT HE WAS DOING THERE AND HE COULD NOT ANSWER FOR A FEW MOMENTS. I ASKED WHERE HE WAS AND HE SAID HE WAS IN OREGON.  I ASKED HOW HE GOT WHERE HE WAS AND HE BEGAN TELLING ME ABOUT FOLLOWING SOMEONE TO A LAKE AND HOW HE HAD PULLED INTO A FIELD AND THEN RAN OUT OF GAS. I COULD NOT SMELL ANY ALCOHOL ON HIM NOR DID I SEE ANY SIGN OF ITS USE AND HE DENIED ANY DRUG USE.  IN THE AREA  WHERE HE HAD BEEN LYING IT APPEARED HE HAD BEEN ROLLING AROUND. HIS WALLET AND MONEY WERE ON THE GROUND BESIDE HIM.  THERE WERE ALSO NUMEROUS FOOTPRINTS IN THE AREA WHERE HE WAS. ALL THE TRACKS MATCHED THE TENNIS SHOES HE WAS WEARING AND THEY APPEARED TO HAVE BEEN MADE BY SOMEONE WHO WAS CONFUSED. AS I BEGAN TALKING TO THE MAN HE TOLD ME THAT HE WAS GOING TO TELL ME SOMETHING THAT I WOULD FIND HARD TO BELIEVE. HE TOLD ME THAT HE THOUGHT HE HAD BEEN KIDNAPPED BY ALIENS. HE SAID AFTER HE RAN OUT OF GAS HE STARTED WALKING TOWARD SOME LIGHTS THAT HE SAW. HE SAID AS HE WAS WALKING, A CAR WENT AROUND HIM AND HE THOUGHT IT WAS GOING TO STOP AND PICK HIM UP. IT PULLED AHEAD OF HIM QUITE AWAYS AND STOPPED WHICH HE THOUGHT WAS STRANGE. HE SAID A MAN GOT OUT OF THE CAR AND LOOKED AT HIM. HE DESCRIBED THE MAN AS HAVING GLOWING GREEN EYES. HE SAID AT THAT TIME HE LOOKED BEHIND HIM AND SAW BESIDE HIM TWO OTHER MEN. ONE ON EACH SIDE. ONE OF THE MEN  HAD GLOWING GREEN EYES AND THE OTHER ONE HAD EYES THAT GLOWE! D LIKE D IAMONDS. THE MEN DID NOT SAY ANYTHING TO HIM BUT HE COULD TELL THEY WERE TELLING HIM TO TRUST THEM. THE MAN BEGAN TO FEEL AS IF HE WAS BEING SHOCKED AND SAID HE COULD NOT MOVE. HE SAID THE MEMORY WAS VERY VIVID TO HIM, ALTHOUGH THE EVENTS LEADING UP TO THE ENCOUNTER WERE SOMEWHAT BLURRED IN HIS MEMORY. THE MAN WAS VERY THIRSTY AT THE TIME I PICKED HIM UP. WE BEGAN LOOKING FOR HIS CAR AND AFTER SEARCHING FOR IT FOR ABOUT THIRTY MINUTES WE FOUND THE CAR APPROX. ONE TO ONE AND AHALF MILES AWAY WHERE HE HAD RUN OUT OF GAS IN A PLOWED FIELD. I CONTACTED THE SON OF THE MAN AND HE WAS SURPRISED AT WHERE HIS FATHER WAS AND WHAT HE WAS REPORTING TO ME. THE SON DESCRIBED THE MAN AS BEING THE MOST RATIONAL AND SANE MAN YOU WOULD MEET. I ALSO CALLED THE MAN&#39;S DAUGHTER AND SHE REPORTED THAT AT APPROX. 0445 THAT SAME MORNING THE MAN CALLED HER ON HIS CELL PHONE WHICH HE WAS CARRYING WITH HIM AND HAD WITH HIM WHEN I FOUND HIM. HE TOLD HIS DAUGHTER AT THE TIME THAT HE WAS BEING KIDNAPPED BY ALIENS AND THE CELL PHONE WENT DEAD. HE WAS ALSO REPORTED TO HAVE CALLED A FRIEND IN ((country name deleted))  AND TOLD HIM THE SAME THING. THE MORE I WAS WITH THE MAN THE LESS CONFUSED HE BECAME HOWEVER THE EVENTS PRIOR TO THE REPORTED CONTACT WERE STILL HAZY BUT THOSE OF THE EVENT WERE CLEAR. I COULD NOT FIND ANY OF HIS TRACKS LEADING TO WHERE I FOUND HIM HOWEVER VEHICULAR TRAFFIC AND THE WIND COULD HAVE DONE AWAY WITH THEM.  AFTER GETTING FUEL FOR HIS VEHICLE THE MAN CONTINUED ON TO HIS DESTINATION.<n>

THESE &#34;STARS&#34; KEPT BOUNCING AROUND,CHANGING PATTERNS.<n> <n><n> <n><n> three of us were outside saying goodbye for the night.  the sky was filled with stars, and we were all admiring them.  i noticed one that was much larger and brighter than normal, and it seemed to be moving alot.  i said nothing, and cleaned my glasses, tried to look around for uranus and neptune but the moving &#34;star&#34; kept catching my attention.  It seemed like alot of the other stars around it were moving, pulsating, changing color, so i kept cleaning glasses and tring to focus better, thought i was seeing things.  after about 5-7 minutes my husband and friend commented on &#34;that really bright flashing weird looking star&#34; we noticed another to the lower right also moving in bouncy pulsating,then  about 10 min. later we see 3 lights in a straight vertical line, equally spaced. they were in between the 2 big lights.  watched them for an hour and half.  lots of strange patterns. groups of smaller lights clustered very close would puff in and out of sight. bottom star of vertical formation moved up and slightly to left,out of sync with others.  all seemed to dance around and change colors every so often. airplane headed towards the group, when it got close to lower righthand star it went past it then suddenly seemed to move backwards for a second before continuing.  strangly enough we also saw at least 5 shooting stars while watching the lights. tiny lights seemed to move quikly in to the 2 big lights and disappear.  biggest light showed a very strange light pattern once.  it seemed to flash a band of colored light around it.  the pattern pulsed as if to a rythm, with at least 3 sections of light.  we would have continued to watch, but it was time to go to work.  all of us kept trying to convince ourselves that ther was a really great explanation for this. we kept watching trying to figure out if this was real.  im glad i was not alone out there or i would have thought i was going crazy.  we vowed not to tell anyone else, knowing that this is something no one would believe. i checked the local news and the! astrono my reports hoping to find reasonable explanation, but have found none./ id like to know if anyone else saw this or anything like this before, was it just stars or whaT?<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Report is not inconsistent with &#34;twinkling&#34; stars, we feel.

I had left Flagstaff, AZ about 7:00 in the morning and was on my way to my home in central Texas. In spite of it being a very long drive, I was quite lucid. I was headed east on Interstate 20. Abilene was behind me, and I was on one of the emptier stretches of the highway between that city and Ft. Worth. I happened to look up into the sky at some point when I noticed a large number of lights moving through the night sky. I saw many such lights over the course of the next several minutes. I saw lights on objects that seemed to be shaped like tops, and I saw lighted cigar-shaped craft. However, since it was dark I assumed these objects were simply normal aircraft (i.e., helicopters or planes) that I couldn&#39;t see very well. Then, I clearly saw two craft which immediately caught my attention. I could see them clearly, as they flew low relative to the other objects. They were cone-shaped, with the flat end at a slight angle. The flat ends had several lines of lights on them. These lights were steady (they did not seem to blink or flicker). They seemed to be gray or a dull black in color. The lights were white. One craft followed the other, flying in a straight line through the sky. I could only see them for a short while before I had travelled too far along the road and lost sight of them. They flew &#34;fat end&#34; first.<n>

PD))<n> <n><n> <n><n> Three faint objects in wedge formation travelling very fast and very high<n> <n><n> <n><n> I stepped out to smoke a cigarette, like I have done many times before.  I was living in a rural area, and light pollution was almost non-existant.  It was a crisp and clear night.  I was looking at the sky, as I always did, spotting satellites and meteors, etc.  I then saw three very faint lights, in a isosoles triangular formation, travelling from north to south.  There was one light in the front of the formation, and the other two were behind to left and right.  They travelled in a straight line like satellites do, and made no sound.  Their brightness remained the same the entire time I saw them.  The strange thing was that at certain times, one of the two trailing objects would start to lag behind the other two, and then suddenly accellerate to catch up, to make the formation a perfect isosoles triangle again.  I was unable to tell the altitude of the objects, but it seemed they were in earth orbit.  If they were in orbit, the three objects would have been separated by several miles between each other.  I thought they might have been fighter jets from Plattsburg AFB, and if they were they would have been flying very high.  However, they covered the sky from horizon to horizon in about 3 minutes, and as I said they were very faint.  My second guess was they were maybe SDI satellites, due to the triangular formation, maybe used to triangulate an incoming warhead?  I thought I would report this anyway, hoping maybe someone could answer this.<n>

We watched as a form of lights appeared a few miles out from our view coming from the east. There is an airport in that direction, Stewart International Airport. As it got closer the aircraft was not like a plane. It had more lights and wasn&#39;t moving as fast as an airplane does. It started to fly over my house directly and made an extremely loud rumbling noise. The aircraft was octagon shaped and all black. It had a light on each side of it and was moving at about 15 to 20 MPH. It was very low to the ground for an airplane. My house is 40 feet tall plus a TV antenna making a total of 55 feet. The craft was a few feet higher and we ran to the back window to watch it continue on but it disappeared before we could watch it fly over my backyard. We believe it blasted away before we could see it come over the house fully. The craft was 30 feet in diameter (estimated).<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD))<n>

Looked at it with a ITT generation 2 night scope,There was a second light. It was very near the first brighter light traveling south west. I let my daughter look at them for abought 30 seconds or so. Then I looked at them again, to my amazement there was a third light converging close to the first two lights. They came together to form a square formation trveling south at about 180 degrees. They stayed in formation untill they finally faded at about 215 degrees.When they did come into the formation all three lights were the same brighness.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with this witness.

The lights were some white some amber and some red. They were flying toward us at first as if they were flying side by side and then they turned abruptly to the east (their left) and when they did it looked as if they picked up speed then the lights were gone. Unless they were closer than we think, it appeared as if they were accelerating faster than any helicopter. I say helicopter because that is my only explanation for lights at night in this wild area. There is a large wilderness area beneath where these lights were. It is known as the Tug Hill Plateau which is a large blank area on most maps of New York State to the South and slightly east of the city of Watertown. If it wasn&#39;t a group of 10th Mountain Division troops from Fort Drum conducting some kind of night exercise then I have no explanation. We have lived here all of our lives 45 years and have never seen any 10th Mountain Division helicopters flying at night. I also should mention that there was no noise at all, either because of the distance or that the craft didn&#39;t make any noise. The night was still and quiet as there are few active people around here that time of night and no traffic at all. We wanted to call an air traffic control center in Syracuse at Hancock Airport but there is no number to call and we couldn&#39;t find any Fort Drum numbers. If anyone knows how to get a quick report from a radar center or something I would appreciate it so if we see anything again we can call someone and ask if they can identify it. Thanks.<n>

8/10/00 22:00|Indian Lake|NY|Formation|10 minutes|Unmoving horizontal formation of about 8 very bright lights in the West from Indian Lake low to the horizon|8/19/00|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/013/S13802.html|204|ndxe200008| Unmoving horizontal formation of about 8 very bright lights in the West from Indian Lake low to the horizon<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was camping for the week with my family and my friends family on Island campsite #17 on Camp Island on Indain Lake, which is a State campround.  We were sitting around the fire after dinner.  It had been dark for about an hour.  My friend called my attention to some lights in the West that he had been watching for perhaps 20 seconds.  I turned around and saw perhaps 8 bright lights just above the horizon to the West.  They looked like aircraft landing lights on a plane within 5 miles as they were lined up horizontally, but they jsut hung there and I had never heard of an airplane with that many landing lights and they went out after perhaps 10 seconds which is also not typical of landing lights.  My friend said that he had watched it for about 20 seconds before he thought to tell me and that the lights had been bright as &#34;welding arc&#34; and had maintained the same formation.  We also noticed that there were three columns of diffuse light coming from ground level and pointing straight up, also in the West.  Other members of our party witnessed these and thought they looked like Northern Lights except they did not waver at all and seemed to be more like beams coming from the ground like weal search lights.  These remained for maybe 10 minutes.  Perhaps a minute or two after the formation disappeared, it reappeared in about the same place although in a more red to yellow color and not so much in line.  They again stayed put. This lasted maybe 20 seconds before going out.  We watched closely after that and soon saw very tiny reddish dots, again in the West, that were zipping about in what seemed to be a random pattern.  My guess is about 10 of these.  We watched for quite a while and didn&#39;t see anything after that. This incident really spooked my wife as she had, without any provocation (such as UFO stories, sightings, or anything at all related) reported to me early Wednesday morning that she had a &#34;dream&#34; that seemed incredibly real that at about 5AM she heard a low pulsing sound above the tent and subsequent to that felt some kind of &#34;beam&#34; pass through her body.  It scared her to death and she tried to call out to me but could not move or make a noise.  She reported that all she remembers after that is waking and remembering the experience and she was VERY frightened.  Nobody else saw or heard anything and we all joked with her about it and asked if the spacemen &#34;did anything sexual to her&#34; (ala the movie &#34;Independence Day&#34;).  In retrospect the coincidence gave us pause. Fueling at the boat dock Thursday morning, my friend asked the kid pumping gas if anyone saw anything strange in the sky the prior night.  He siad that he was in the Village of Indian Lake and saw the same formation to the West over the golf course. On Sunday, I mentioned the incident to my uncle who lives in Indian Lake and he said that the same thing was seen in the West by his friends that lived on the lake.  He&#39;s going to talk with them and get more detail to send to me. I don&#39;t have any idea what the lights were, but Rome Air Force base does manuevers in the area of the Lake and I know we have a big year for solar activity.  I be pleased to hear from others who witnessed this incident. P.S.  This report form presupposes sighting of an &#34;object&#34;.  We only saw lights.<n>
8/10/00 21:45|Long Lake|NY|Formation|15 minutes|Formation of 3 lights, followed by fomation of 6 retangular white lights hovering in sky with no noise|8/19/00|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/013/S13786.html|205|ndxe200008| Formation of 3 lights, followed by fomation of 6 retangular white lights hovering in sky with no noise<n> <n><n> <n><n> At 9:45 pm while looking out over the west side of Long Lake towards Buck Mountain my mother noticed a retangular white light hovering in the valley between the mountain and the islands across from us.  There was no noise.  The lights came on one at atime from left to right.  They hovered and faded out rather quickly and reappeared.  We called a friend so he could go outside and observe these lights because we knew he would never believe us.  After the lights went out two friends went down to my dock on the lake to continue to watch the sky.  They (the two friends) had seen three lights appear in the sky 45 minutes before these lights appeared but didn&#39;t think they were much of anything.  After a few minutes the three lights appeared again but they had shifted to the south ever so slightly but still hovering above the tree line.  I was rather frightened but I continued to look and then six lights came on sequentially from left to right this time.  Again whitish in a horizontal line and it looked as though those lights were turning, lifting up somewhat and then the lights vanished.  A few minutes later my two friends on the dock spotted a very very bright light over Buck Mountain and they observed this light shooting straight down.  AFter that no more lights were seen.  The next day I talked to two campers that also observed the lights.  I also found out that I had two friends at the South End of the lake see simalar lights that night, but they had also seen the lights on Monday August 7th.  They saw 6 lights and then another row of 6 lights in a V formation after having seen three lights (looking at drawings we saw very similar formation)  They didn&#39;t want to tell anyone because they figured no one would believe them.  A few kids saw lights two days before I did in Minerva and chased the lights with their car but the lights disappeared.  A witness also saw lights on his drive from Indian Lake to Blue Mt. Lake on Thurs, Aug 10th at approx 9:30pm.  So we know we were not the only ones to see the lights. ! We made calls to the Air Force and apparently they were doing manoevuers that night but two of my friends spotted two aircraft much farther north and they spotted the aircraft several minutes after we saw the light formation.  We also speculated Fort Drum because it is to the west of us but upon contacting The Adirondack Daily Enterprise after a story on the lights appeared there this weekend Fort Drum was ruled out.  Are we the chosen ones?  We were rejected and you know what that is okay with me because it scared the pants off me.  Where I condsider myself a cynical non-believer at heart, this definitely altered my mind.<n> <n><n> Peter,<n> <n><n> Thank you for getting back to me so quickly.  First of all the area where the<n> <n><n> lights were spotted were in a remote area of the Adirondack Mountains.  In<n> <n><n> fact where I was staying at the time there is no electricity on either side<n> <n><n> of the lake at that point.  There would definitely not have been a blimp<n> <n><n> there at the time.  In fact the posting from New York State from a location<n> <n><n> near Watertown on the same day is most likely the same thing that I spotted<n> <n><n> with my group of friends.  The description is pretty accurate.  As far as<n> <n><n> having others post for you, I&#39;ll give it a try but most of the folks aren&#39;t<n> <n><n> into the computer thing.  I&#39;ll have my one friend that was with me at the<n> <n><n> time submit his version because he started to see a light formation about 45<n> <n><n> minutes before the rest of us.  My cousin contacted an air force base<n> <n><n> southwest of the Adirondacks and they confirmed that they were doing<n> <n><n> manoevures that night but I feel pretty confident that this was definitely<n> <n><n> not anything that was related to air craft activities.  The Adirondack Daily<n> <n><n> Enterprise is doing a story on the sightings and you can reach the reporter<n> <n><n> if you want to at 518-891-2600, her first name is Victoria (sorry I can&#39;t<n> <n><n> remember her last name) ((NUFORC Note:  we intentionally leave the newspaper contact information in this report.))  I&#39;m sure she would be interested in talking to you<n> <n><n> for her story and she can maybe put something in the article about posting<n> <n><n> submissions.    She has been contacting people around the area because many<n> <n><n> people have called her because there was a published report in Sat August<n> <n><n> 12th&#39;s paper.<n> <n><n> <n><n> How would I send a map to you?  If you get a map of New York State, Long Lake<n> <n><n> is in the center of the Adirondack Park, south of Lake Placid, North of Lake<n> <n><n> George...  Sightings were also made from Saranac Lake (info from newspaper<n> <n><n> article)<n> <n><n> <n><n> I also read a posting from a person that works at the prison north of LL in<n> <n><n> Malone that described the UFO on Monday August 7th, my friends saw it on Aug.<n> <n><n> 7th too so I have the feeling these sightings are also related.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It&#39;s very interesting, have you ever spotted a UFO, do you have any thoughts<n> <n><n> on UFO&#39;s?  All I know was that it was extremely creepy and I ran in to grab<n> <n><n> the children because I was totally afraid.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So yes the area was remote, full of wilderness.  The Adirondack Park is 6<n> <n><n> million acres large public/privately owned.  I hope this sparks your<n> <n><n> interest.  Also I checked and someone in Massachusetts also saw a similar<n> <n><n> formation (these are all from your website) so we want to know what it<n> <n><n> was.....<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thanks again<n> <n><n> ((name deleted))<n>

Suspended in the same spot for over 10 minutes<n> <n><n> <n><n> While out rollerblading last night noticed a large red object suspended in the sky. I was looking South in the night sky.  The object just cleared the tree line and looked to be fairly low in the sky approximately 10 miles away.  The light was a pulsating red light which moved up and down, (in relation to the tops of the trees).  The weather was clear and there was no cloud cover.  I watched the object for about ten minutes, it was just suspended in the Southern sky.  There were no flashing lights and it did not appear to be a plane,a flare, or a helicopter. When I went to get my husband, the object was no longer visible. I do not know if it flew away or if it just moved out of our line of vision.  This is about the third time I have seen this light in the sky during different times of the year. It always is in the same spot and some times it is visible for longer periods of time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We do not know what it was the witness observed, but the location in the sky where she saw the object is generally where the star, &#34;Arcturus,&#34; is located, I believe.  It is a bright star, and it &#34;twinkles.&#34;  PD))<n>

As we were entering our door, we were on the front porch, when she pointed right above us, and asked me &#34;Mama what&#39;s that&#34;? I looked up and right above us, appx 20ft, was a object, circular I believe now, because as we looked up, it started a light show.  Lights went around the craft in green, white and red, amazing...I looked further into the sky and could see two other crafts further in the distance...well I dropped my bags, ran inside to get my video camera, of course it had no batteries, so I proceeded to call my cousin who lives approx. 10 miles to the southeast, they thought I was crazy....well I don&#39;t remember what we did then.  Whether we stayed and watched it, went inside, etc...that part has been bugging me for years, I can&#39;t remember if I just closed the door on it...I can&#39;t believe that I would...and I have an excellent memory, but this evades me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> That&#39;s my siting, and it was amazing, just amazing.  That craft was right above us, I live in the country.  It put on a light show for us!   My daughter ended up joining the military 7 years later, and nobody in our family has ever been in the military, and it&#39;s a big family.  She always said she was going to be the Prime Minister of Canada one day...perhaps it was there for her....odd regardless and something I just can&#39;t forget nor she.<n>

At that time he went outside his front door and was met by a blinding white light that illuminated his house and street.  The light suddenly went out and he noticed both his outdoor mercury vapor lights and street lights were out.  As he stood in the total darkness, he was again surrounded by the intensely bright light that lasted about a minute then once again blinked out to sudden darkness.  About a minute and a half later he heard a rumbling sound like a sonic boom but said it sounded more seismic, like the noise that sometimes precedes an earthquake, and his windows in his house rattled but the ground never shook.  Following the vibration, he looked towards the NE sky and saw what appeared to be two faint white &#34;falling stars&#34; that were &#34;falling&#34; side by side and disappeared at the same moment.  Mr. R. reported that there were no visual observations of normal aircraft or helicopters in the sky during the event and no sound was heard, with the exception of the rumbling. Additional Case Info: A few minutes later there was a small M2.4 earthquake about 30 miles away at 23:43 PM (PDT - 06:43UT), but due to the low magnitude of the quake, the sonic effects are not thought to be connected with the earthquake.  It is unknown whether or not the earthquake is coincidental or is somehow connected to the original event, as the two &#34;falling stars&#34; fell in the direction of the location of the succeeding earthquake.

The lights were the color of fire, very bright, and appeared to be quite large. They looked very similar to military flares, however, they maintained their altitude, and were moving in a horizontal motion, going out of sight behind a distant treeline. Our location was on a hill, 20 to 30 miles from Ft. Cambell Army Base. The lights were low on the horizon, very close together, with one slightly higher and to the rear of the leading one. No sound was heard. The distance, we estimated at two to three miles, the altitude, around 2500 ft. The lights were large enough to be very obvious should anyone in the area happened to have looked up. They were the first thing I noticed, when we walked outside. My friends and I are middleaged management/professionals with no desire for notoriety. This was the second sighting for each of us, of something seen in the sky that we could&#39;nt fully explain.

Similar to &#34;sun dogs&#34; (which I&#39;ve seen several times) this was much more spectacular.

We were talking about the weather and how perfectly clear it was.  I was looking at the starts when three of them started to move around.  They eventually got bigger and bigger until it seemed like they were right on top of us.  Then they even changed color from a bright white to a dark red to blue back to a dark red.  There wasn&#39;t any noises that we could hear but there was a weird static electricity feeling, like having your hair stand up straight.  Anyway, one of my friends passed out (I guess he was too scared) and my other friend and I leaned over to see what was wrong and when we looked back there was nothing there.  I don&#39;t really know if that was considered a UFO sighting, but I can&#39;t think of anything else that would explain what happened.  I&#39;ve heard of ligtning balls, but they only occur when it&#39;s storming.

On the second night, we noticed an orange orb of light out over the ocean but high enough to be a foot over the rooftops of the houses in front of ours. The lights were an orange color and were about the size of a street light. The sky would be dark, and all of a sudden, the light would just turn on instantly just like a car headlight. Only this was maybe 2 miles out over the ocean and were way too high in the sky to be confused for a boat on the horizon or a flare. The light would turn on, and start to dim and fade out. It would be dark again, and a few minutes would pass and all of the sudden it would turn on again, and begin to fade out again. We managed to capture this on video the second night with houses in front of us along with cars going by just to prove it was real. At one time, two lights would turn on at once and begin to fade out. I ruled it out that these could be natural occuring phenomon because there had to be thought behind it. There was a pattern that would keep occuring. The way the would light up one right after the other and fade out definitly showed that this could not have been any kind of ball lightning(no clouds) or a flare because a flare would be much brighter and would move. These lights never moved farther than a foot to the left or right. And every night, you could expect them to be in the same position. We could basically time them and know exactly what time they would occur.<n>

She looked up at the moon which was 2/3rd full that evening when she spotted some kind of aircraft that was hovering around the moon.  She asked me what it was.  When I looked up I and saw that it was something very unusual, I stopped the car in the first driveway we came to, to get a better look.  I happened to have my camera with us and was able to get two pictures of the object which was a saucer type shape with a dome on top with a SLR 35 mm camera with a 28 to 70 zoom lens zoomed to 70.  It looked like it has windows in the dome with lights and the craft was silver.  I got one picture while it was hovering and by the time I wound the film for the next shot, it had moved at a high speed closer and to the right (that&#39;s when I got the next shot).  Before I could advance the film again, I watched the craft speed off and suddenly it disappeared.  I never took my eyes off the object from the time we first spotted it until the time it disappeared.  My daughter witnessed all this as well and we both have 20-20 vision.  There was no sound or jet stream of any kind.<n>

This was weird! In Staten Island?? I dont know what it was, i thought maybe a balloon or something let loose(?). It did look like it was traveling a set path though, a definite direction.

I usually sit and watch the stars when I saw an unusual white light.There were no other lights on the object and I could not tell the shape. It was about as bright as a star. I was facing the west and the light was about at 30 deg from the horizon and about 30 deg to the north of the constellation Taurus. I cannot tell how far away it was, but from my best guestimate it would have been some where between Placerville and Lake Tahoe, moving in a north-westerly direction. The speed wasnt as fast as a satellite would be but it wasnt as slow as a plane. I saw the light for about 15-30 seconds then it slowly faded out. I kept watching it thinking it was a plane but there was no sign of any strobes, which if it had been a plane I would have been able to see. I can definately say it wasn&#39;t an airplane.<n>

I noticed a disk shaped object to my right, about 1/2 mile north of the Interstate and maybe 500 feet in altitude.  My son and his cousin also saw the object.  It&#39;s color was blue-silver and wobbled slightly.  The sun reflected off its surface several times.  I asked my son to hand me my binoculars while I pulled the vehicle over to the side of the Interstate.  I was thinking at the time that the UFO would probably disappear before I had a chance to view it.  As I pulled over and took the binoculars and as I scanned the sky the object was gone.  Neither I, nor my son and his cousin could locate the disk.  We saw it for less than 60 seconds. THe disk shaped object had no wings and appeared metalic and smooth with no  windows or doors.  The sky was clear, no clouds.  It left no trail, no lights, no apparent sound.  A few minutes later we did observe a small private plane eastbound and south of the interstate.  I teach high school, my son and his cousin are currently in 8th grade. I am an amatuer astronomer and was heading to a local campground for a sky show that evening.<n>

I was looking almost directly up trying to track the sound of a very highe light plane.  I saw a disk like light greyish/white object hovering.  The object was somewhat hazy or fuzzy appearing because of the altitude and the vapor and smke haze in the sky.  As I was watching this object trying to rationalize why it was their the jump plane apperd from my right side entering my circle of vision traveling North to South.  I passed beneeth the disc and the tail of the light aircraft obscured the disk momentarilly.  The disc continued to hover for another secondor two, the jumpers were exiting when the disc accelerated from the position obove me towards the NE.  From Molalla towards the Mount Hood area, approximately 140degrees of sky, in about 3seconds.  Some rudimentary calcs placed the disc above 45000 feet.

We wathced that one for several minutes just playing around in the sky. After a few more minutes we saw a second appear. From our view it seemed as if they were just playing with one another. After a few minutes of wathcing those two a third object appeared and seemed to be doing the same.  We tried to get a camera but we did not succeed. They were in the sky to the left of us but we could make out thier shape and size very easily. They were about the size of a large cow. We watched them longer and then they seemed to hit the ground and came right back up and then disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We believe the witness implies the night of 06AU00.

8/6/00 23:00|Florence|OR|Light|2 hrs|Sighting of two brilliant orbs of light over ocean in Florence Oregon, August 2000|6/4/04|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/036/S36901.html|234|ndxe200008| Sighting of two brilliant orbs of light over ocean in Florence Oregon, August 2000<n> <n><n> <n><n> Just found this site as I was surfing the &#39;net (which was a fluke as I am not into UFO research or sightings as a hobby or anything.) Upon finding this I became curious, so I checked something out...and I was amazed to find a sighting similar to ours (in exact same location!) Therefore, I thought I should report this even though it happened almost four years ago. I didn&#39;t know what to with this information at the time but I&#39;m thrilled to have found this site now and think such events should definitely be reported. While vacationing with my mate in Florence Oregon, August of 2000 (can&#39;t recall the exact day but I&#39;m sure it was the first week of Aug) from our resort window - which was a perfect unobstructed view - we watched two extremely large, bright orbs hovering over the pacific ocean (very far out, probably thousands of miles, in the middle of the pacific.) They were too high to be ship lights and too active to be stars...they moved up and down, sometimes going quite high, sometimes hovering just above the water. We watched them through high powered binoculars as they shifted left, then right, then up and down. They would come closer and suddenly move a great distant away again at an extremely fast pace (in almost a flash.) I forgot to mention, one was a reddish orb, the other a green one and both approx. same size - although the green one seemed slightly smaller at times (maybe farther away?) Out of the brighter, reddish orb a smaller white glowing orb appeared to come out of it and circle around it, then float beside it for a time, then go back inside. We watched this happen for almost two hours when below on the beach, a man was walking alone and we watched him stop and observe the moving lights. (Maybe he saw them from his window also and went down to get a closer look.) Suddenly both of the massive lights went very high and just as quickly appeared to descend, then vanished - poof! (They appeared to have gone under the water.) We have never seen anything like this before nor sinc! e and are not UFO watchers. Needless to say this was quite unexpected! We assume it was probably some type of Gov. experiment/aircraft. Thanks!<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>
8/6/00 21:30|Fresno|CA|Light|10min.|Two nights in a row. We were not scared, even though we knew they could not possibly be  planes.|8/19/00|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/013/S13705.html|235|ndxe200008| Two nights in a row. We were not scared, even though we knew they could not possibly be  planes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I went outside during a commercial on TV and looked up into the sky facing North. The sky was clear and the stars were easy to see. I saw an extremly bright red light comming from the North heading South very high in the sky.  It was quite large and moving not like a plane but sort of sideways kind of like a Z but still in the same direction. It had a red light and a green light but no light in the front like a plane.  I called for my husband to hurry because it was moving kind of fast. My husband and children came out also.  It passed almost directly over us and had very bright light on the bottom but made no sound. I don&#39;t know if we heard nothing because it made no sound or because it was so high up, but the white lights on the bottom were very bright. We had to walk to the street to continue to see it because of the roof top and because of the brightness we were able to watch it for about 10 minutes, until we lost it.  I wanted to tell people at work the next day but didn&#39;t want people to think I was strange.  Then tonight 8/7/00 when my husband went outside around 9:45pm I followed him we saw 2 objects comming from the north east heading in a straight line south east, like the night before just as high in the sky but moving fast.  There were two airplanes with one of the objects in back and it moved so fast it passed the airplane like it was standing still.  The objects lights have a different look than a plane.  We watched them and the planes until the tree got in the way.  Then about 5 min later there were 3 more comming from the same direction moving very fast faster than a jet and flashing only red lights.  At one point one disappeared (no lights) then they all disappeared (lights gone) then reappeared (lights on all at the same time).  They were in an -l pattern (like a backwards L). It took only a few min maybe 1-3 to pass from the north to the south then out of sight because of the tree.  I saw no white lights tonight. We have a reserve base in Fresno and we see alot of jets fly. We also ha! ve an ai rport and can see the planes take off.  These objects including the planes did not take off from Fresno due to the high altitude they were flying and the proximiaty of the airport to my home. The objects were flying faster than any jet I have seen take off from Fresno. We do not live in the airports flight path, planes don&#39;t usually fly over our house. The objects tonight were in the same flight path as we see the big jets fly. Tomorrow night I plan on looking for them between 9-10pm hopefully the sky will be clear again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We do not know what the witness is describing, but she states that the object had a red light and a green light on it.  These colors are suggestive to us  of an aircraft.  Any vessel, either a ship or an aircraft, must have a red light on its left side, and a green light on its right side, in order to facilitate avoidance during navigation at night.  PD))<n>

Above airliner traffic, and faster.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We live on a hill top and have a excellent view of the night sky.  While going to take the trash out I looked up and remarked to my wife what a clear night is was and how many airliners were visible.  I saw a object that at first looked like a typical satelight, small bright object moving at a steady rate from south to North.  It was about the size of a star in the sky, and just about as bright, a little hazy.  Airliners were visible at lower levels traveling slower than the light.  It still looked like a satelight then it made a sweeping turn to the East, Satelight do not make turns, and faded out of site.  The object appeard to be above 80,000 ft. because of the hazy look to the light.  There were no blinking lights, no flashing lights, just a steady bright light.  It was moving faster than the airliners heading north to Seattle and considerably above them.<n>

Motion was from approx W to E. Elevation over 50k ft. ?? . Looked like yellow plastic bag at first. Had to lay on my back on the lounge to keep clear focus on object. The yellow thing was pulsating from round or full to narrow and skinny. This pulsing seemed to be moving it across the sky. A regular pulsing like breathing. Maybe one second intervals between fat to skinny.  Not visible at all to the naked eye. After it passed the moon I watched it till my eyes got tired and I wanted to see how far from the moon it had progressed. I found it once more with a bit of effort only to loose it for good. I wouldn&#39;t say it was any sort of space craft. It almost looked alive, or some sort of naurally powered thing. It may have been flying garbage. At the elevation I estimated, it could have been quite large. It seemed unusual enough I wanted to report it to see if anyone else has seen anything like it. ????????<n>

We had all been watching for satellites and had even had 2 in perpendicular orbits pass real close to one another (2&#34; at arms-length I&#39;d estimate) and there was about 5 of us seeing it. We all thought that was cool. August also sees an increase in meteoric activity, which we all took in. Skies were mostly clear, humid, 70F, 1/2? moon in the West. I had been left on the shore to watch the catfish lines while my friends went back to town to get another 4X4 truck. I sat, watching satellites go by, and the frequent falling stars, when I looked North to the lowest part of the spoon in the Big Dipper constellation. I watched a light become bright as it moved in what would become a S-SE direction. I assumed, that the increase in light intensity was due to the sun&#39;s position below the horizon, and the satellite entering the light from the long-set Sun. (We know that as satellites move into the Earth&#39;s shadow, the light fades and they disappear. And I grew up in the country with my dad&#39;s 8&#34; reflector Celestron with the Earth-clock tripod, so I know my way around the stars well enough to hold the evening&#39;s conversation.) Anyway, as I watched the &#34;satellite&#34; move, I noticed that it was a slower speed than any of the (at least 6) satellites I had observed in that evening, and suddenly I saw another appear behind it, maybe 1/2&#34; at arms-length at perhaps 4 o&#39;clock as looking at a clock. I thought that this was a treat, since seeing two satellites in such proximity is rare, (if not totally regulated &#34;illegal&#34; by some NASA trajectory-assignment committee). From the time I saw the first, until the second appeared, was possibly 20 seconds. At this point, they may have been 3/4 of the distance through an arc between the horizon and a vertical axis going up through my body. As soon as I saw the second, I had two reference points moving in the sky, and was immediately aware that the speed of one was erratic at best. Using the stars in the background, I was then able to verify that they traveled less a trajectory, but rather in a meandering direction, neither holding a constant speed at this point. The second never passed the first. Then, as they were at a point I would describe as 11 O&#39;clock, I saw the third. I felt a rush of disappointment that everyone had left. I watched the three lights, and I hate to try and judge their altitude, but I would put them as &#34;orbit&#34;. If you were to hold a 30/60/90 triangle up in the air, with the right-angle facing to your right, that is a good representation of the &#34;formation&#34; they tried to hold, and the hypotenuse of the triangle would be no larger than an inch at arms-length. They all seemed to &#34;inch-worm&#34; across the sky, all wavering slightly in direction, still traveling at what must have been an ungodly speed, with conservative accelerations to what seemed to be trying to preserve the formation. At this point, I had been watching them for probably 2 minutes, had taken off my glasses, looked away, shook my head, opened a 7Up, looked back and they were all still there. I shouted at them, waved, screamed at them that their formation looked shitty, and began to realize that the third, the dimmest of the three could not keep control. The second seemed to act as a &#34;chase-plane&#34;, like the Tigers that follow the Shuttle&#39;s entry.  Sometimes, the second would slow to alongside the third, making equilateral triangle, sometimes drop behind, but not for long. It seemed intent on trying to hold its own position in the formation. I hate to say it, but it seemed like none of them were keeping control. I watched them for what I would estimate as 4.5-5 minutes, as they crossed the arc of the sky. It actually became boring, as I wanted to see some of those eye-blinking accelerations I have heard of. But they continued to stumble their way across the sky at from my vantage seemed a languid, haphazardly jaunt. They faded out of light in the S-SE, as would a satellite re-entering the Earth&#39;s shadow. That&#39;s one of the reasons I say their altitude was orbit-level.<n>
8/5/00 23:30|Maple Falls|WA|Formation|:30|Triangular formation (3 light points) sited traveling from north to south on a clear evening - east of Bellingham, WA. .|8/19/00|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/013/S13753.html|241|ndxe200008| Triangular formation (3 light points) sited traveling from north to south on a clear evening - east of Bellingham, WA. .<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was sitting outside enjoying the warm evening around a fire, while watching the clear skies and looking at stars.  All of a sudden I realized that a triangular shaped group of stars were moving in what appeared to be a downward.  I later realized instead of it moving from top to bottom, it was actually moving from north to south. I pointed this out to my friends who were outside with me and they were very skeptical at first but realized that this was something quite extrodinary.  One believed it could be the space station or three satellites traveling in the same orbit, but this was dismissed when one of the &#34;stars&#34; moved out of formation and then sped up to regroup with the other two to form the triangle again. This was a very clear evening and we were watching the sky for some time, noticing many meteorites and lots of other sky &#34;traffic&#34;.  However, this was something that really surprised my friends though I have been aware of UFO possibilities since I was a child in Indiana. The three lights were white/pink in color and traveled at a relatively slow rate of speed, yet when one veered off course then sped up to catch the others - my suspicion grew deeper.  These were traveling at a relatively high, but other stars were blocked when the object moved towards them...hence indicating that the object was lower in the sky than I originally thought. As for the backgrounds of the observers - 2 are in their late 30&#39;s and the other is 40 years old.  3 males, all professionals - 1 accountant (web based company), one salesperson with a masters in theater, and myself - computer/administrative support.  All were coherent and alert...<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  This may be yet another report of what we believe are three satellites flying in precise formation over several weeks&#39; duration.  They were first reported to us during the summer of 1996, and during several times periods since.  We believe that they are satellites launched by the U. S. Navy for surveillance of the Earth&#39;s surface, but we are not certain.  They were first identified by Mr. Terrence Dickinson, reporter for the Toronto Star.  There are several other reports for the months of July and August 2000, I. e. 04AU00 and 05AU00.  PD))<n>

As we watch the is nosieless red dot make a 90 degree turn to the north on the California side of the lake I went in to get my binoculars and came out and rested my elbows on my truck and could see this was a red cone with the point on the top with a redish orange below it. I followed it with binoculars until it became a red dot through them and came in to report this event to you. The sky was cloudless and no wind temp was around 100 degrees.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  The witness corrected the date of the sighitng.  It occurred on Saturday, 05AU00.  We do not understand the apparent discrepancy between the time of occurrence, and the time of the report, but it may be due to a computer setting.  PD))<n>

We were about half way home driving east on the mass pike. It was about 9:30pm and a very clear night. I looked up at the stars when I spoted something about 5000 feet high. It was a dark, square object with four lights on each corner. I thought it was a jetliner at first glance but when I looked back I couldn&#39;t recognize it. I watched it for maby about 30 seconds wondering what it was. Then I saw a small light move very fast below the craft and dissapear. I was confused. I watched for about two more minutes and saw a total of 4 of these objects do this. I looked at dad wondering if I should tell him. I didn&#39;t but when I looked back, the craft was not there any more. I figured it was a UFO and have not told anyone since.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

The helicopter was probably heading to the Deer Valley Airport to refuel. Then, after the object, a large passenger-type plane with the red,green and white lights flew in its path towards it at way  too low of an altitude to be in a flight pattern for Sky Harbor. It seemed to be at a 135 degree angle.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with this witness, and found him to be quite convincing.  PD))<n>

So as we looked to the sky we noticed 4 specs of moving light.  Satellites we thought, but they seemed to take the shape of a green-gray cube like from, with red lights speckled here and there.  They got closer and closer, and we noticed the diamond formation was not ever deviated from.  At first we thougth we were hallucinating, but as it got closer, we knew we weren&#39;t.  It was obviously an alien craft.  we went inside the house and immediately called our friend, who was asleep.  He woke, and ran over to my house to see what all the comotion was about.  When he arrived the crafts had vanished.  He still doubts us, but we know what we saw.<n>

They were 3 separate objects as stars could be seen inside the formation. The speed was that of a typical satellite (about 2-4 minutes to cross the sky). The shortest side faced approx. NW-WNW, the longest side faced approx. SW-SSW. (The obtuse angle was between these two sides). It traveled in a direction between it&#39;s longest side and southern most tip(it&#39;s tip would have been at a SE position, whereas it headed SSE). They were a large formation, at least 1 and a quarter inches at arm&#39;s length (about half the big dipper&#39;s pot). They were at different magnitudes, the southern most tip was the brightest. They disappeared into the earth&#39;s shadow which confirmed that they weren&#39;t self illuminating, there was also no sound, it&#39;s highly unlikely that they were jets. I checked Heavens-above.com for satellites at this time but found only one at a similar time-but going in the opposite direction. I suppose it&#39;s possible for satellite orbits to line up, but this seemed peculiar so I thought I&#39;d report it. I&#39;m an engineer in the aerospace industry, the other witness is a physician&#39;s assistant-soon to be pilot. We both watched the objects and thought it was peculiar, although not impossible for satellites...maybe...hmmm.<n>

The object began brightening intensely over a period of approx. 3 to 4 seconds, appearing to be bright bluish-white in color.  The object then dimmed and moved across toward the western sky.  The path was steady but had slight increasing angle to the horizon.  Movement was similar to a satellite.  At a position of rough bearing of 260 degrees, the object diverted from a trajectory of moving across the sky to one of increasing angle above the horizon.  The object was dimming thru the entire movement process, making it difficult to continue tracking it.  It was also beginning to slow.  It appeared to almost stop movement at a point 60 degrees above the horizon, then its trajectory continued moving toward a higher angle above the horizon. The entire movement occured over a period of approximately 25 to 30 seconds.  Contact was lost when the object was approximately 75 to 80 degrees above the horizon at a rough bearing of 230 degrees.  I stopped looking for the object at 2304 hrs.  Object was sighted by naked eye.  Skies were clear, no aircraft near the object, no moonlight in my line of site.<n>

As I tried to follow them with the recorder they semed to turn slightly right and slow to a stop. I recorded a plane flying below them in the view finder for a reference. Also as they appeared to stop they seemed to fade and then grow brighter. Don&#39;t know if the lights faded because of the plane going by or not but we have a few minutes of it on video with a porch and planes as a reference.It flew directly overhead of my wife and kids.<n>

Each UFO actually had 2 or more lights inside, making it look like one object from a distance. Several commercial jets are seen crusing under the objects as they come in for a landing. The event was so incredible I took off the high powered lense to shoot wide angle shots of the UFOs and the airtraffic. We called a list of people with cameras in the Gilbert area so others got video also. The objects appeared to be moving south and raising in altitude.

They were moving very slowly at a south easterly direction.  THere were airplanes moving fairly close to them as they were positioned in on the flight paths to Sky HArbor Airport.  They continued to move very slowly keeping the same distance apart.  One appeared to blink out one time and would on occasion appear dimmer.

I asked him how high did you think it was and he said about the height of normal helicopter. He said it made no sound at all, it was all silver/grayish. I then asked him if this object was on the ground how big do you think it would be and says as large as our mini-van. It had no lights. What a lucky kid!<n>

We didn&#39;t think much of it until it seemed to get bigger (from the haze) and it had moved north.  It hovered above the tree line very slowly.

The way it was moving there was no way it was any sort of plane, balloon, hellicoptor, ect. The object would move forward then move 5-15 feet to either side (not a zig zag pattern) but more like it was making a varaity of L shaped turns at 90 degrees and kept going until I couldnt see it any longer.

My wife noticed a white object descending from the sky and told me to look.  Just as I turned my head a saw a white object, which then immediately turned to a neon green color.  As we watched, the object continued to descend and then began to fade.  It was moving faster than an aircraft, but slower than a meteor.  It did not leave an ionization trail, as a meteor would, and did not emit any noticeable sounds.  The object, when it changed color, did so immediately, not gradually.  It was descending at about 25 degrees off of the horizon.  It appeared to be a glowing ball, surrounded by either an aura or gas, that appeared to travel with it, without leaving a trail.  The aura/gas tapered off almost immediately behind the object.  After the object went behind the treeline and out of view, we waited five more minutes and my wife, feeling cold, went back into the house.  I stayed outside five more minutes, and deciding to go in, had one more look up at the sky.  I then saw a bright light almost directly above, that at first I thought was a bright star.  The light was not there earlier, and seemed to just appear as I looked up.  The light began to fade immediately, and then disappeared.  It did not show any motion, nor did I hear any sounds.  I decided to stay out a little longer and then counted nine conventional aircraft within the next five minutes, which did not seem normal at this time of night, as I normally go out at night to look at the stars when smoking.  I normally see about three or four aircraft.  I also saw one aircraft a few minutes after the initial sighting of the descending object, for a total of ten craft in as many minutes.<n>

At that point, my first instinct was that it was an airplane blowing up in the sky.  I work for an airline and thought it had to be a plane of some sort blowing up in the sky.  The &#34;object&#34; appeared to burn for a short period of time (5-15 seconds) and then it appeared to completely burn out, leaving 2 trails of smoke behind.  We saw nothing after this.  I have heard nothing of the sighting on the local or national news, radio, newspaper or in conversation.<n>

I lost it for a moment and saw it again about 2 inch away and thought &#34;that moved pretty fast&#34;.It did this three times each one less bright.Then it seemed to stop and turn in a cicle , I thought that maybe I saw it do that because it was so small and so i was disorientated and thougyht I was going to loss it but it did stop and turned around, it justturned the way it came and speed off, much faster than it was moving when it was blinking,towards the moon, almost like the speed you would see a shooting star but i saw it much longer and it was a tad slower. It seemed to be red in color, like when you look at the stars and can kinda see if it is blue or red or white.I didnt lose sight of it untill it went past the moon, i couldnt follow it it was to fast.I know I saw something i am not crazy!planes dont just stoand turn around and leave faster than they came, plus it was to high in the sky looking like the smallest star you can see w/your naked eye.Im scared now.are there really aliens out there i never really worried about it but this was just staight up freaky!thank you for letting me talk about this my boyfriend thinks im seeing things but this was about a 3 1/2 min sighting i couldnt emagine something for that long, im sorry but that is just stupid.let me know what you know(if anything)about this.<n>

They were hovering for a long period of time, they had lights, to me ,it seemed like it looked like a tophat or some upright cylinder also at the same time I saw a pulsating star in another direction and also a very strange light in the middle of the woods beside our house<n>

He&#39;s an avid sky watcher now that we&#39;ve moved to Arizona. He had his binoculars and pointed to this red point of light that appeared to be stationary in the northwestern sky. As I looked through the bino&#39;s I could tell that whatever it was was very high in altitude and was moving fast, not slow. It was traveling east. As it got directly above us it made a 90 degree turn north, went on for 3 seconds then dissapeared. It stayed red the entire time, no strobe lights, and no pulsations.<n>

My family and I wathed this red circle of light for about 2hours. During that time,my wife called one the local news station&#39;s to report the strange red light but to our disappointment the woman on the phone said they have been recieving many calls about the red circle of light and not to be concerned about it,that it was only a plane. I don&#39;t know what it was but I can tell you it was no plane.I never seen a plane stay in one spot for two hours.My family and I took photos of the ufo with a 35mm camera. At about 23:00 hours the red circle of light disappeared but we could still see dark round shape where the red light was. We wathed this dark image head northeast for a short while as it blended into the night sky. As I said before, I don&#39;t know what it was but I do know it was not a plane......<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Anonymous report.

We watched an oval shaped white object moving accross the blue sky, going east from Libby.  There were no clouds and it was before we had any smoke from the fires.  We looked down for just a couple seconds to get my binoculars, and when we looked back up all we could see was blue sky.  It had disappeared!<n>

It flew quickly, and our view was blocked by one of the evergreens across the street. It looked like it was very far away. It seemed like the sunlight was reflecting off of a sort of rim along the side; there was also above it that curved toward the shiny part which made us think that it was 3-d and circular. . .I hope that made sense! We see planes flying to and from the airport all the time, and we discussed that we have never seen one fly that quickly, or at such a strange angle.<n>

I got my binoculars, and saw a silver disk-shaped object with a very bright light on one side.  As I followed this object, another very bright light crossed it&#39;s path going from south to north.  These were definitely not jets.  An airliner did pass overhead going from northwest to southeast during that time.  I heard a high-pitched whirring sound during this sighting.  I&#39;ve never witnessed any other event like it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness identifies herself as a business owner.

8/3/00 07:40|Delta (Canada)|BC|Cigar|about 5 minutes|Silvery cigar hovers over Boundary Bay|12/2/00|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/015/S15124.html|280|ndxe200008| Silvery cigar hovers over Boundary Bay<n> <n><n> <n><n> ). I was driving west on highway 10, north of the Boundary Bay airport. The sky was absolutely clear with no clouds. I saw a small propeller powered plane, heading west. It was probably getting ready to land or had just taken off from the airport. I suddenly noticed an object in the same part of the sky (from my viewing perspective), as the airplane. At first I thought it was a passenger jet flying at a considerable altitude higher (and further away), than the propeller plane. The more I looked at it, the more I thought that it did not look like a jet, and it appeared to be hanging motionless in the sky (although I was of course, moving west at about 80 km per hour). It was quite light colored (whitish), but I also thought it had a bit of a silvery look to it. I did not see any winglike features, but the object did not look round or ellipsoid. Plus it did not really seem to have any distinct shadowed area in its underside. I very much wanted to stop to get a better look, but I didn&#39;t want to pull over on the narrow highway shoulder, so I drove on to the Delta Community Hall intersection (keeping an eye on the object as best as I safely could while operating my vehicle) and drove north a short distance, where I found a spot to pull over and stop. I got out of my vehicle for a better look, but I could no longer find the object in the sky. I thought it quite odd that it had disappeared so fast, when it had not appeared to be moving when I had observed it just a minute before. My best estimate of the object position would be that it was probably at least 2000 foot elevation, (and quite possibly a mile or two elevation) and appeared to be situated directly above Boundary Bay, between White Rock and Point Roberts. I would estimate that the object was probably at least five meters across. It was situated in a SSW direction from my viewing position, about 25 to 30 degrees above the horizon. My estimate on the objects height is partly based on the fact that it had a far away and indistinct look (contour and edges obscured by distance, no sharp outline, color contrasts or shadow).  I probably observed it over a distance of about one half a mile, without it changing significantly in direction, indicating the object was potentially moving in a westerly direction and close by (less than a mile away), or more likely, not moving much in east/west direction and further away (which matches perceived distance perception). A high flying jet, moving directly away from my observing position and increasing in elevation would explain the lack of movement. But this would not account for its fairly sudden disappearance (although the object seemed far away, it did not appear to be moving away at a fast rate). The perceived shape of the object did not match an end view of a jet, although unfortunately, I never had a chance to get a really good look at it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date was corrected by investigator to 03AU00.

Sometimes we could see a very dimly lit light after the bright lights went out.  This went on for about 1 and a half hours, and there were people in the house behind us and a few houses down that were also watching this go on.  During this a prop plane came out and flew down the coast line 15 times around the area that we saw the object.  A coast guard craft? also appeared out in the distance and moved very quickly several times down the coast.  There was a fishing boat that was right underneath the object when it first started appearing, it moved very quickly out of the distance during the activity.  In the sky behind us we saw 4 Military jets? moving extemeley fast, 3 had red lights and they looked like they were escorting a forth craft that was had a white light. They quickly dissappeared into the distance.  At 11:00pm was the last time we saw the bright light appear over the ocean, we estimate it maybe a half mile from our porch over the ocean.  We saw nothing the next two nights.<n>

There was a pulsing light with red strobing suspended stationary in the sky.  It appeared to be quite a distance away and was there longer than the 20 mins that I observed it.  I had seen a similar light the year before only the light was due East.  My son actually observed this with me and we watched it approximately 20 minutes.  Interestingly, the on both occassions the light was missing at the same time the following day.  I assumed that it was a &#34;blinking&#34; star at first but it did not move nor did it seem to travel at all during the time that I was watching it. There was no 2nd guessing the second event because it was directly in the middle of two of my tall trees.  I would not have had difficulty finding it again but it just wasn&#39;t there the next night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  The description of the first sighting seems consistent with a &#34;twinkling&#34; star.  However, we have no explanation for why the object did not appear the next night.  We receive many reports like this, and our only guess is that the celestial object is in a slightly different part of the sky at the time the witness attempts to look at, or for, the object a second time.  Most non-scientifically oriented observers are not very experienced at looking at the night sky, we observe.  Just a guess, however.  PD))<n>

Tried to look at the object through binochulars, but could not achieve a sharp image, possible mist or haze surrounding which could be obscuring sighting. My best guess would be at about 50 miles from here due north. Possible aircraft apart from the fact that it is so still in the sky and is being so for so long. The sky is clear of any cloud/mist.<n>

I was driving west on I90 at the border of pensilvania and New-York.  I saw what I first though was a plane landing. It had 2 white lights and one blue light. After 2 minutes, I figured out that it was taking too long for the plane to land.  At that time I also realized that it had no flashing light like a normal plane.  I slow down and observed the craft more carefully.  It was on my right. I then understood that it was moving very slowly.  I pointed out the triangle for the 2 other witnesses in the car. One of them told me that it was at set of fixed light on the electric towers.  I agreed, but I stop the car on the side of the road and observed the craft more carefully.  We confirmed that it was moving very slowly toward est. At that time, the blue light that was pointing away from us shuted down and a blue light on the other side of the craft turned on. That gave us the impression that the craft was not trianglular but rectangular. The blue light turned off and the craft continued to move to est.  The two white lights remained on until we lost sighting behind the tree top.  Total 1 min of observation from the side of the road.  Evaluated distance of travel for the 1 minute observation : 800 meters. We could not evaluate for the presence of sound or not because of the highway noise. We could not see any part of the craft exept for the lights because of the darkness. We were inside of a zone of tunderstorm, but there was no rain at the time of the sighing.  There was lightning. The ceiling was very low, and there was no fuzz on the light suggesting that it was flying below the clouds. One other withness saw a ovaloid tube like object leaving the craft, the 2 other witnesses did not confirmed. The flight behaving of the craft was just like a blimp.<n>

It had the same color and intensity of a star. We saw it descend from the edge of the atmosphere looking towards the northeast. It moved downward for almost a minute before it turned at about 90 degrees and headed back out of the sky accelerating as it left. It looked like a ball of white light but it seemed to move in a coordinated manner. We stood ther and watched in amazement not sure of what it was that we were seeing. I am still unsure. I think that if a being or person were inside it, as it was a solid object, they would have been killed by the rapid change of direction it made. It seemed to defy gravity and to have the limitaions of flight that &#39;known&#39; manmade objects possess.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I had to lean forward to be able to see up through the windshield to observe 3 identical black triangular objects.

There were no markings, lights or familiar aircraft features (stabilizers, etc.), just a solid black object. the objects were in a loose triangle formation separated from each other by a distance of approximately 5 times their individual width. What struck me most was their stillness and almost silhouette-like appearance.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My impression is that the objects were the size of private jets or fighter planes. They were significantly higher in altitude that the normal Santa Monica airport traffic that occurs regularly in that area, enough so that a closed fist at arms length could have covered two of the objects (were they spaced tip to tip).<n> <n><n> <n><n> While observing them, I moved my head to change my viewing angle so as to verify that this was not caused by debris on the widshield or reflections.

It was a bright sunny day with the rising sun shining west towards Seattle and the Olympic Mountains.  Light was relfecting and it was beautiful. Approximately above Lake Washington, about the height of  traffic helicopters, I saw 3 lights moving East almost along the freeway.  They were moving steadily and seemingly average speed, but their shape was very long, with the apex of the triangle shape above 2 smaller white lights.  They appeared to be one object moving absolutely together.  I kept looking while I was driving, at first thinking it was a helicopter with smaller planes flying near it.  When I went around the overpass and looked back again, it had disappeared.  The top light was so bright, it almost blinded me.  It wasn&#39;t a blimp, a jet plane or a helicopter.  I was convinced I had seen a UFO and went to work as usual.  I told my coworker what I had thought, but did nothing else! I listened to the news that morning to see if anyone else had seen anything in the area.  Nothing. I slowed in the traffic to just look up and try to figure it out.<n>

I was looking up in the sky since it was a clear night, making it a nice night for star gazing.  I happened to see a very fast moving light in the southern half of the sky.  At first I took it for a satellite, but then I saw a second light behind it htat seemed to be chasing the first light. They went straight across the sky for about 5 seconds in a north-northwesterly direction then the first light started to turn and start and stop like it was evading the second light.  The second light chased it like there was a dogfight or something.  The first light did at least three full 360&#39;s before taking off at a very high speed to the northwest.  These objects appeared to be very very high in the sky and moved in such a fashion that I don&#39;t believe they could have been planes.<n>

I am not sure of the date, I cannot pinpoint it in my memory.  I do remember that it was near my girlfriend&#39;s birthday, which is in August, and that when I went to see her back then, we stayed up late, as I did not have to work early, so I estimate the time as somewhere between 1 am and 3 am, CST.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was heading west on highway 10, and I was just approaching Prescott, WI when, out of the corner of my eye, over a darkened corn field to my left, I saw something move.  I turned my head and looked.  At first, I thought it was a reflection of my dashboard lights on the window glass, so I decided to roll down my window.  The light was still there, pacing my car, about 1-1.5 miles to the south of me, over the cornfield.  after a few minutes of watching this light and not paying attention to the road, I decided to stop my car on the side of the highway.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I looked down for a split second to get my cell phone so that I could call my girlfriend and tell her what I was seeing.  When I looked up, I saw the light streak east and disappear.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My cell phone, which is never turned off, and had no mechanical problems, was turned off.  When I turned it back on, the time did not register right away, and I had no signal in an area in which I normally have full signal.  For about five minutes I sat there, my car idling while I tried to get my cell to work properly.  It would not.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It would not right itself until I got home that night, some 20 minutes later.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.

8/1/00 02:00|Hingham|MA|Triangle|minutes|A triangular shaped UFO hovering at a slow pace at a low altitude.|8/5/01|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/017/S17687.html|296|ndxe200008| A triangular shaped UFO hovering at a slow pace at a low altitude.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A friend and I were driving home from a friend&#39;s house when I saw a triangulat shaped flying object.  At first glance it looked to be a plane, but as I thought about it, it was flying abnormally low for the location.  It was just above the treeline.  I had my friend stop the car and turn around to get a better look.  We both looked at each other and mentioned that it definitely was NOT a plane.  It wasn&#39;t really &#34;flying&#34; but more like hovering at a slow pace.  We couldnt really see the object well itself because it was dark, but the lights helped to outline it.  It looked to be triangular, with lights on each point.  Not like a plane would be with lights on the wingspan and tail but more like a stealth bomber would look like.  (I suppose it could have been a stealth bomber aside from the odd location it was in and its slow hovering.)  We watched it untill it dissapeared behind some tall trees and we went home.  I know that helicopters can hover...but I am 100% sure that it was not a helicopter. My friend and I told our friends about what we saw and it was nother really more than a weird story, little thought about afterwards.  Untill around two weeks later, two of my other friends told me that they saw the same object that I had described.  They said that they saw a triangular shaped object hovering abnormally low at about the same time of night (2-3am) and at the exactly same location!  They drove closer to the object for a few minutes observing it more.  As they drove home they said that the object was following them.  They said that they&#39;d drive for awhile, look up, and the object wasnt far from behind them.  Although it prob wasnt actually &#34;following&#34; them more than it was just travelling in their general direction. These were the only two sightings of this UFO that I know of.  They occured in about a two week inveral in August of 2000.  I have no idea of the exact dates.  I thought it was definitely strange that two different groups saw the same thing, at the same time of day, at the same location.  I don&#39;t know how credible the story is since the only sightings that I know of were by me and friends of mine.  Maybe other pople saw it too, but i have no way of knowing.  All I know is that I myself, or my friends weren&#39;t lying or extending the truth.  I forgot to mention that the object wasn&#39;t making any noise either that I could hear.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

First one just kept flying out in to space, kept getting smaller and smaller, then the other two did the same.  I phoned my brother in the US and described the event so I knew that it had really happened.  One led and the other two followed flying in a trianle formation.  No sound.  Very beautiful.  They were following the river maybe fifty feet above the water.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous.  PD))<n>
