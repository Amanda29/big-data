I was walking home from the movie, either Friday or Saturday, when this disk shaped object flew over me in a southwestern direction.  It was grayish or silver in color and had lights inside but were not shining a beam outside.  It appeared to be perhaps 500 feet, or possibly less, above the ground.  I told other people about it, but they did not believe me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date in September 1949 is approximate.  PD))<n>

They were arranged in a circle and the group was slowly rotating. At random intervals they would break away and reunite and continue the rotation. I called my mother and sisters to come and see them too, which they did.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The entire episode lasted about 15 minutes. Some time later my father came home from work and told us we would not beleive what he just saw. We told we would.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  Lights probably were not advertising lights, given the date of the sighting, we believe.  PD))<n>
