After 8 minutes, one light started to fade out until all three faded out at the 10 minute mark.<n>
12/31/09 23:46|Austin|TX|Disk|5 minutes|New Years Eve Unkown object in the sky above Downtown Austin Texas|2/14/10|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/073/S73978.html|2|ndxe200912| New Years Eve Unkown object in the sky above Downtown Austin Texas<n> <n><n> <n><n> Right before Midnight on New Years ever, we were standing on 6th street downtown Austin, Texas in front of the Silver New Years eve ball with a big crowd of people. We waiting for the countdown to New Years Eve, there was music playing, people dancing, balloons etc. It was very cold and there fast moving clouds in the sky. The Moon was very Bright that night allowing you to see past the clouds and the stars beyond.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was standing there and looking at the Bright Moon along with a huge search/event light from some event somewhere circling back and forth against the clouds and the sky. As I was watching and starring at the moon, my eyes caught a dark, round dot looking thing moving inside the fast moving clouds. It was hard to see but you can at times clearly see it was round as if watching a perfect dot (circle) in the sky and dark, it was jerking back and forth in different patterns. Moving very fast, back and forth in different patterns and directions. Then it stopped and lit up very bright and it was gone. As soon as I noticed it the first time I pointed it out to my son and my wife. He could not see what I was looking at , at first, then he noticed it right before it lit up and he said after it lit up it took off at a hi rate of speed. My wife was also trying to see it and she got a glimpse of it at the last moment. I was pointing up at it trying to get the crowd to see it, but did! n’t notice anyone else looking at it, besides the search/event light would have made them look at that first and distract from the object. Balloons were being released and I compared the object to a balloon but balloons never made it that hi up and would not have been as big at that height.  I work as a computer engineer; my son is active duty army. The object was directly above us when noticed. If it was a balloon it would have been much smaller and harder to see at that height, along with why did it light up then disappear?<n>

We were looking up at the sky because the moon was full and bright. We were facing south and we saw this orangish light going across the sky from east to west.  It was too high to be a helicopter and too fast to be a plane.  The solid light was steadily moving across the sky. As we keep our eyes on it, we notice it begins to slow down.  Then it comes a complete stop. It hovers there for about 5 minutes.  By the time I found my binnoculars the light, still at a stop, begins to dim and slowly fades away.  It was the weirdest thing we&#39;ve ever seen.<n>

One of them was higher than the other and started to go into the clouds but the other one flew over us and went straight up and disappeared into the clouds.  There was no noise and both of them were a bright brilliant orange light shape.  These were no planes or helicopters and i my wife and my son all saw the same thing.<n>

The sighting took place New Years eve on my way home from work around 11:15 p.m.  This light seemed very high in the sky and traveled across the sky in a matter of seconds. traveled in a straight line until it went behind some clouds, then emerged on the other sides of the clouds.  It continued to traveled in an arch until it disappeared beyond the horizon.<n>

I stepped out of my car and saw several orange balls shoot into the air.  I thought at first it was fireworks since it was New Year’s Eve.  I walked to the end of the driveway, maybe 5 feet to get a better look without tree limbs in my way.  The balls made a formation that looked to me like a check mark.  They hung in the air for a minute or two.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I started to walk into the house, all the time looking at the orange balls.  In the time it took to open the front door and tell a relative about what I saw and tell them to come outside and see it too, the balls were gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We went around to the back of the house, thinking that we may be able to see it back there.  Nothing.  All of this happened on the south side of town.<n>

The object moved from 2:00 to 6:00 then to 8:00 getting smaller as it went. At 8:00 it simultaneously turned verticallly and into the shape of a cigar. It then steadily moved away into the southeastern sky until we could not see it anymore. As it left it seemed to punch through the sky through a ring of clouds.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Looking straight up, I thought I was looking at some strange new form of fieworks over my house.  However, I soon realized these objects were too high up and too large to be fireworks.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What I saw was two large internally lighted spheres traveling in a northeast to southwest direction toward New Orleans from Slidell where I live.  They were identical spheres traveling at about 50-60 mph, in a perfectly parallel course at the same altitude and speed.  Their altitude appeared to be about 1000 to 1200 feet and they were about the size of a small house or about 75 feet in diameter.  The wind was virtually calm and there was a broken low overcast cloud cover.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The spheres appeared to be made of translucent glass or ceramic material which appeared glowed pink over-all with uneven blue and gray horizontal bands around them.  They glowed from within and were clearly visible for about three minutes before disappearing into a low hanging cloud bank.  The strangest characteristic was that they had a collar around the bottom of the spheres which was emitting yellow flames in a downward direction which bent back away from the direction of travel.  Looking up into them was like looking into an upside down can of burning Sterno, but much bigger.  The flames were too big to be a hot air balloon and would have set a balloon on fire because they were also deflected up the sides of the objects by their speed of travel. They were also going too fast, and at too constant a speed and altitude, to have been ballons.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There were no navigation lights, beams, or other forms of illumination visible.  They glowed with a soft glow from inside them which made them clearly visible in the night sky.  There were no visible windows or other openings to be seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They appeared to possibly have been man-made robotic craft of some sort, but I know of no craft with these characteristics that could possibly fly in the manner of these two spheres.  For this reason I have to classify them as unidentified flying objects.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am a retired college instructor and former private pilot familiar with many forms of aircraft, but I have never seen any like this.<n>

There were three lights in a “V” formation which were pale blue in color, and the outer two lights kept changing in their intensity - “twinkling” in unison, while the center light at the tip of the “v” remained stable.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Because Denver International Airport is nearby, we thought at first the lights might belong to commercial or private aircraft -- but on closer observation we noticed there were no regulation aviation strobes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Also, the lights hovered in the same location for the entire 15 minutes we watched.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We went indoors when the cold finally got to us and tried to find a window from which they were visible, but trees blocked our view.<n>

I had not been drinking on the night of the sighting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was at my home in Slidell, Louisiana, on the night of December 31, 2009 when the sighting occured.  I went outside on my back deck at approximately 9:00 P.M. to observe the New years Eve fireworks going off in my neighborhood.  I happened to look straight up and saw what I thought at first to be some unusual fireworks.  In a few seconds however, I realized I was looking at two strange aircraft which were way too high up to be fireworks.  I saw two identical, perfectly spherical, internally lighted, translucent globes which were predominantly pink in color with uneven pastel blue and gray bands around the globe.  They were not brightly lit, nor did they have any other visible lights on them such as navigation lights, but they were easily visible in the night sky.  They had no visible windows or openings that I could see.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They were each about the size of a small house and were at an altitude of about 1,000 to 1,200 feet, and were moving from the Northeast to the Southwest in the general direction of New Orleans across Lake Pontchartrain.  They were flying on a perfectly parallel course at a distance of about an eigth of a mile from one another at exactly the same speed, which appeared to be about 50 t0 60 miles per hour.  One was slightly ahead of the other.  They eventually disappeared into some low hanging clouds a mile or so from where I was standing.  In all, I viewed them for about three minutes, and never heard a sound from them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The most unusual and distinctive features of the craft were the flange-like collars they had around the bottoms of the globes. From these collars were coming flames which looked like regular fire, not a rocket flame.  These flames did not appear to be any kind of a propulsion system because the flames were deflected backwards by the wind created by the speed of the objects moving through the air on a perpendicular course to the bottom of the globes.  When they first passed over me, I was able to look straight up into the burning cavity created by the collar on the bottom of the globe and it reminded me of what looking into an upside down burning can of Sterno might look like.<n> <n><n> <n><n> These craft looked like they could have been man-made objects, but no man-made objects with these attributes could possibly fly in the way that these did. I&#39;ve never seen anything like these craft before or since this sighting so I have to classify them as being unidentified flying objects.<n>

It was unusually bright though. We thought it might be a plane on fire.  It was a very yellowish/white light.  Then it abruptly stopped and began to hover over our neighborhood.  It hovered then disappeared in a blink then two more air crafts came on very fast, hovered then dissapeared in a blink as well.  Some nieghbors down the street also saw because they were shouting and pointing.  We have never met them though so we have not discussed it with them.  We have never seen anything like this.

The object had the brightness comparable to a firework flare but did not either sparkle or change color.  The magnitude or brightness did not change as compared to a firework flare and decelerated and changed direction.  My best guess would be that it was south of the Boise metro area.<n>

The light placement was similar to an airplane. However, the object did not move but remained stationary, or cruised at such a slow crawl that it appeared to be hovering.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We considered it might be radio-tower lights (of which there are many on the mountains in that stretch of road) but the lights were above us and the road. Our next thought was that it could be a helicopter, but there was no detectable blade noise and the distance between the lights was closer to an airplane wingspan; it would have had to have been a bigger helicopter than I&#39;m aware of in existence. I can&#39;t think of anything else that can hover or travel at such slow speeds besides a blimp...but how often are blimps even flown?...especially after dark and over a highway, rather than a sporting event?  It remained in our line of sight as we drove for approximately 30 seconds to under a minute before the road curvature obscured our view behind the treeline.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;ve waited this long to report it because I&#39;ve periodically been checking this site, and similar reporting sites, to see if anyone else collaborated this sighting, to no avail. So, I guess I&#39;ll be the first to report it.<n>

About 20 minutes after the pilot announced we had reached our cruising altitude of 35,000 feet, I noticed what appeared to be five large rods protruding upward from the clouds off the right wing about 1/4 mile to a 1/2 mile out.  The rods looked like manmade structures, each about 10-20 feet high.  Each rod had the appearance of a cell-phone tower -- metallic weaving.  There were five rods in total, each spaced approximately 80-150 feet apart, forming what looked like a pentagon. No connecting tower or craft was visible.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I pointed this out to a younger friend, who at first didn&#39;t notice them.  After a minute or so, he finally located they him.  He said they appeared to be &#34;drifting.&#34;  Again, we were at 35,000 feet, so there&#39;s no way they could have been part of a grounded structure.  They remained visible for about 6-8 minutes before our flight moved away.  They never appeared to move and visibility was very good at our altitude.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We checked into weather instrumentation and nothing matches. I&#39;m still not convinced it was a UFO, but certainly strange.<n>

Just east of the World Drive exchange I could see what almost looked like aircraft lights.  I would have totally brushed it off as an aircraft, as we genearlly have lots of those in the Orlando Area but they didnt seem to move.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The lights were also very close to the ground, and usually landing lights on a jet liner will hit part of the fuselage, and nothing like that was visable.  Ususally large aircraft are not close to the ground at this point, as they are also close to Disney World.. and I think the FAA doesn&#39;t allow large comercial traffic to be low flying above a theme park.  I&#39;m not sure what I was seeing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There are not any radio towers here, I didnt see anything that looked like a blimp (bowl games.. etc) and there were way too many lights, and too far apart for it to be a helicopter.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Lights were at all three po! ints of the triangle, with one large light in the center pointing down. About 1/2 way between each point was another smaller light.  Nothing flashed, all lights were white. Someone else had to hvae seen this.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am kicking myself for not stopping my car along the highway and taking a picture with my cellphone.<n>

I let my dogs out to go to the bathroom and was standing on my front porch and just happen to look up.  The moon was not quite full but it was very bright and the clouds were across the whole sky, they were very spotty like a net.  You could clearly see the moon and the halo it cast on the clouds.  I saw an round &#34;shadow&#34; move through the light cast on the clouds.   I don&#39;t know the size because I don&#39;t know the distance but it was the same size as the moon in the sky.   I could tell it was behind the clouds and and it totally blocked the light from the moon.  Once it was out of that halo of light I could not see it any more.  It made no sound.   It  moved through the sky the way a spot light does, kind of a sweeping circle but it was not a light.  All of this happened in about 5 seconds.  I went and got my husband and we both watched for about another half an hour but never saw it again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC NOTE:  Witness indicates that date of the sighting is approximate.

My son counted and He came up with the number of Four crafts too.  They were disc shaped...and traveling like a group of geese do..in a &#34;V&#34; grouping.  What made it a little scary is that we then saw two fighter jets, (or military air planes) going towards the four U.F.O.&#39;s....but then slowed up almost once they realized that the objects were above them...(and that is how we realized also how actually close they were to earth&#39;s surface is by the jets ratio to the ground an! d where they were in perspective~it went Stars..crafts...Military planes...ground/us))  They (the military jets) then too changed their direction almost like they didn&#39;t know what to do....The whole incident couldn&#39;t have lasted more than 7-10 minutes, we both came inside after they all moved further away ot of site from where we couldn&#39;t  see any longer...<n> <n><n> <n><n> We came inside talked it over, almost in shock like &#34;did we just see what we thought we saw?&#34;~~it was one of those moments that we won&#39;t ever forget.  That is how I came to your site, wondering if anyone saw or heard anything in the sky at that time...to see what , if anyone knows, it was.  I have replayed this moment in my mind...and there is NO other explanation other than it had to be a U.F.O.<n>

The lights were both white and red.  To me, it looked like a bullet without its casing.  It was falling really quick.  There were trees blocking its trajectory. So, it may have hit the ground.  There was no explosion of any kind, no fire, no sound, no smoke. It all happened in just a few seconds.<n>

I observed five lights in the sky in front of me.  They were arranged left to right, two close together, one single, two close together.  The spacing of the three sets was about the distance from your index finger to your little finger when held at arms length in front of you.  The lights moved together slowly from west to east (left to right), as though they were attached to one object.  I could see there was a mass there, but being night time I couldn&#39;t see what it was clearly, despite the full moon overhead.  It just seemed to be a darker area in the sky where the lights were.  The lights moved slowly and disappeared behind some trees to my right, just off the roadway.  They appeared to be at a lower altitude because of how quickly they went behind the trees.  Then I lost sight of them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am a licensed pilot (Airline Transport Pilot license) and know what an airplane looks like.  With these lights there was no red flashing beacon, no flashing strobes, no colored navigation lights.  I thought maybe it was some high altitude jets going by, but again, no strobe lights.  They stayed perfectly seperated too.  Maybe a plane from the local airport, but it was moving slowly and steadily, and at an altitude that I could only guess was below 5000&#39;.  I thought once maybe it was a relection on my windshield, but when I moved my head around the lights didn&#39;t change position.  I couldn&#39;t hear any sound, but then again in my Peterbilt there is quite a bit of noise.<n>

It was flying that fast but faster than a normal jet. I see those all the times with their light flashing as the head towards the airport but this thing didn&#39;t flash at all.It head in one direction and I tried to watch as long as I could. This thing was huge,bigger than anything I have ever seen. I see sattelites all the time but this was not in orbit it was flying and with no sound.

I am from Honolulu, HI and I live near Diamond Head.  It was around 8pm at night when my sister and I decided to go to the grocery store to buy a few things.  As I was about to get into the car, I saw a bright reddish-orange light in the sky moving slowly.  It was a shape of a circle.  My boyfriend was going to go home at that time and was about to leave.  I told him to stop the car and to look at the sky.  I asked him if that was a plane and he told me it was a small airplane.  But, I was thinking that it could not be a plane at all because it was moving too slowly and usually when you see airplanes at night you would see that it would have a blinking light and a sound passing thru.  This bright light I saw didn&#39;t have any sound and it was moving too slowly to even be an airplane. It was moving silently in the sky.  Plus, it was a bit cloudy at that time and this thing was flying low underneath the clouds.  My uncle was also out! side and it caught his eye.  We all were looking at it the whole time.  All of a sudden, that reddish-orange light I saw in the sky stopped moving.  Then, I told my boyfriend,&#34;is it just me because now that light just stopped in the sky and now it looks like a star, but it doesn&#39;t even look like a star.&#34;  Then, my boyfriend told me it wasn&#39;t just me, he also saw that thing move earlier and now it just stopped.  My uncle was also amazed. At that time, my sister was loosing her patience and was calling me to get into the car. I continued to look at it for another good five minutes.  It could not be a meteor or a comet.  It could not be a star because it wasn&#39;t twinkling at all. My mother also wanted to come to the grocery store and I looked at her and told her about what we were looking at in the sky.  As I was talking to my mother, my uncle yelled, &#34;wow, it just dissapeared that&#39;s really weird.&#34;  Then, I looked back in the sky and it was really gone. WEIRD! I dunno if it was a UFO an! d maybe it was something else.  Everytime I would tell somebody! about m y experience they would say maybe it was a star, satellite, or a comet. Who knows...<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.  PD))<n>

When first reported I stated that the object was a football fields length away. It wasn’t It was 50’ from my house.  When I think back on this I recall feeling disoriented during and after the event.  I felt like my senses where out of whack. The object was about 60’ off the ground hanging just above the tree tops. I do recall the object was solid. I could see the night time sky – (stars) around the object but not through the object. There was a very low hum that came from the craft.  I use the word craft because that is what it was. It appears to be stationary and seems to float above the tops of the trees. Actually the one tree that it was just above is now dead.  This all came to being when my dog awakens me first at 4:30 in the morning. Thinking she had to go out. I got up and let her. I came back to bed and and she awaken me again at 5:35am. This time as I was gett! ing out of bed I noticed that there was bright ball of red light over the neighbor’s house which is about 100’ from my house. I got out of bed and went over to my bed room window. Now I live in bi-level home and my bedroom is about 20’ from the ground. Which looking at my neighbor’s house I can see the top of his roof since his house sits lower on the grade.  I raised the window and stuck my head out to get a clear unobstructed view. This is when I first reported this that I thought it was football field’s length away when it wasn’t. I taken notice of the multi-color lights on the craft which where a translucent red, green blue green, and amber to pale yellow. I listen for a sound from the craft and there was low hums that change in pitch but it did remain at the low pitch hum.  I remember that early morning because it was extremely cold out and no wind or sound. I live in the woods and it was so quite you could hear a pin drop.  I awaken my roommate and told him to come to! the window and see this UFO.  He did and asked what it is. No! w he’s n ot a believer and he tried to convince himself that it wasn’t but he was looking at the same things I was looking at.  Has he watched it he was in disbelief?  I told him to stick his head out of the window and listen.  He didn’t hear anything at first and I said just listen.  He than hear the low hum also.  He asked why is it just floating there.   Than he turn and went back to bed.  He was acting strange than. My two dogs where in the room with me and one was back under the bed and the other left the room.  I told my roommate too come back here and look. He did, but he appeared dazed and disoriented.  We watch this for about 5 minutes I walked over to the bed room wall and turned the outside flood lights on and off.  He than told me to stop and live it off and come back to the window. At the time an amber color light came on under the craft and the craft started moving very slow towards the southwest over the tree tops into the woods. I watched as the craft turn slight and ! it appeared to glide as it slowly moved over the trees tops.  I remembered seeing the edge of the craft which I distinctly remember being sleek, metallic, very sharp-clean, crisp edge to it.  I decided to follow it, so I threw my pants, shoes and hooded sweat shirt on, grab my keys and jumped in my car.  I noticed that I couldn’t drive to fast because of the ice that was on the road from a previous snow that we received and everything was frozen. As I drove down out the hills and to a clearing which took me about 3-4 mins. I could see by than the craft apparently picked up speed because it was way off in the distances. I would say about 2 miles away. Even though I was driving in the direction of the craft the whole time. I stopped my car and got out and I could see than that there where multi-color lights going around the center of the craft. I drove down to the main Hwy. but gave up trying to follow it because the roads where to icy to travel at a speed to follow it. I tur! ned around and went back home.  Has I got out of my car I hear! d an app roaching object coming towards me. I looked up and there was this white aircraft with bright white lights under both wings and a bright red light under the belly flying just above the tree tops.  When I first reported this I stated that it sounded like a prop plane. But I recalled that not only a prop sound but has a high pitch whine to the engine. It was moving I would say about 80-100 mph. It was a white plane and the rear of the plane appeared to have various cross sections on it.  I looked straight up and could see the under belly of this plane. It was only about 100 above my head going in the same direction as the craft that was seen.  There is no doubt in my mind that it was a military plane that picked this craft up on radar and was in pursuit of it.  I contacted the local airport the next day since the office was closed on Sunday to see if they have planes leaving the airport at 5:30 in the morning. They said no. they do recall that Sunday morning being no wind and cold. Which was a rare morning for no wind in the area?   I was told to contact HIAirport since they as a local airport do not have radar. I did and never heard back from them.  This is my second sighting. My first was back in 10/1973 on the Eastern Shore of Maryland. That craft was cigar shape metallic/ silver color with portholes. That I viewed at 2:00am on a clear Sunday afternoon with binoculars.  I heard a sound from that craft. It was more of a high pitch whine. Only thing I can truly say is they are here. They’ve been here.  The house that the red light was over as well as the antenna like structure that was hanging down from it with multi-color lights on it was my neighbor who shot himself 6 months before.  I found his body in the woods 6 days after he did himself in.  Family and close friends can’t explain why he did. Is there a link?<n>

The object was about 1000&#39; if that above the tree line and about a football field away. I opened the window to get a clear view and to listen for a sound and it appeared to be gliding or floating more so than being propelled.  The only sound was a quite hum that changed in pitch slightly.  The UFO had various color lights on it.  A white light that was underneath changed from white to blueish green when I flicker my outside lights on and off.  A beam of light appeared to shoot down from it but it didn&#39;t reach the ground.  My friend who saw it also said it appeared more square.  I saw the various color lights which appeared to be attached to what looked like 3 prongs or legs beneath it.  About 15 mins. later we saw an airplane traveling in the direction of the UFO but it was much higher up than the UFO we saw.  That I know was a plane because I was able to hear the plane sound and see the lights on the plane.<n>
12/27/09 02:00|Shannon (approx. 500 km WNW of) (Ireland)||Triangle|approx. 10 minutes|Triangular blinking lights over the North Atlantic Ocean (seen from a commercial aircraft)|2/14/10|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/073/S73962.html|52|ndxe200912| Triangular blinking lights over the North Atlantic Ocean (seen from a commercial aircraft)<n> <n><n> <n><n> Date of Sighting: 27 December 2009 Time of Sighting: approx. 2:00 AM GMT Location: North Atlantic Ocean, approx. 500 km WNW of Shannon, Ireland or approx. 800 km W of Glascow, Scotland  Three bright red lights in a triangular (isoscoles) shape over the North Atlantic Ocean, seen from a window seat (facing south) on Delta Airlines #106 flight from New York (JFK) to Frankfurt, Germany. At about 2:00 AM GMT, I was awake on the transatlantic flight at the time the cabin lights were dimmed and many people were sleeping and there was very little to no activity going on. I looked out the window at the stars, and noticed three bright red lights overhead in the one- to two-o&#39;clock position in the sky. Thinking this was a reflection of cabin lights, I cupped my hands over my eyes to block out any reflecting light. The lights were bright and clear overhead, so I then immediately thought these were outside lights. I looked down over the wing lights, and noticed that the right wing light was white; since I couldn&#39;t see the tail at all from the window, I realized these were not tail lights. In addition, they were overhead, where I had to actually look up from the window,! so I realized these lights were neither part of the plane nor were they land lights, since this was over the ocean.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As this was also in the middle of the non-eventful flight, the cruising altitude had not changed, so the three red lights in triangular form must have been at the very least, 60,000 - 80,000 ft. high. The lights also had a blinking pattern which uniformly looped over and over for the ten-minute sighting: the two left side lights blinked once, followed by the top right light; then the two top lights blinked once, followed by the bottom left light; then all three lights together blinked in unison. This pattern of blinking was happening during the entire time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In addition, unlike seeing another plane in flight, these red lights were stationary - with the Delta airplane moving away. It was like seeing bright blinking lights on the ground - but in reverse. The blinking lights were above and we were flying below, moving more and more out of view. After about ten minutes, the stationary blinking lights were moving out of view as the plane moved further to the &#34;left,&#34; or east. After they were out of view, the view out the window looking in same direction was pitch black; it was then, when I realized this was clearly not a reflection but an actual set of lights in a triangular form, blinking in patterns and &#39;hovering&#39; over the North Atlantic Ocean.<n>

I was driving my youngest son’s girlfriend home in Northeast Oshawa.  I turned off Ritson north of Rossland-east into the neighborhood. As we drove through the street eastward- I could see a bright intense neon green sphere with outlines of bright white light moving within.  It moved over the roof tops of homes some 20 ft above, or lower.  It moved like a bubble in water and was very slow and bright.  The size look small, but maybe bigger than a basketball to guess.  As I drove watching it and screaming out loud to the kids to look.  My son confirms instantly he sees it !  He was NOT even wearing his glasses, as it was about hundred yards away quite bright.  Witnessed for maybe about 4-5 seconds, as we drove by, we then lost sight of it.-- It was that low over the homes .<n> <n><n> <n><n> Needless to say, his girlfriend missed seeing this incredible display.  My son’s reaction after dropping his girlfriend off was upsetting !  He said I should not freak out about some burning light, as I was being embarrassing to him.  I just thought it was quite a sight to witness, as it was that intense of light and very close to the roof tops of the homes.  Its movements were strange.  Like a rushing bubble before hitting the surface.  I thought to add a composite to better illustrate.  Enlargement of spherical object with  intense neon green and slight white inside.<n>

I dismissed it thinking it was a plane and then decided to see how it rises up. But, it did not move like a normal plane. It moved higher and higher in a 45 degree angle and then came down again close enough for me to see a shape. It was roughly triangular. Shaped like a three-pointed star. Three wings and at the edge of each one was a bright white light. These lights blinked consecutively, one after another. It went straight across the sky till I saw it disappear into the grey rain clouds. I think it was grey in colour but i could be wrong because it was a night sky. I am a student and I don&#39;t believe in foreign Life. It could be a weird weapon some country is developing. But it was creepy.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

As if it was a blue flashlight that came from the sky.  That evening the weather was icy, wet snow.  No thunders or lightening.  The flash lasted for approx. 2-3 seconds each time.  Right after the first flash, I immediately thought a hydro transformer had blown from the electric post.  I looked at the transformer through the patio door and saw nothing of the sort.  No noise was heard.  A few seconds before the first flash, the kitchen table light blinked.  We counted at least 5 flashes with a few second intervals.  The first three flashes were seen in the backyard, another one farther left and another one that seemed to be on the side of the house.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Ten to fifteen minutes later, my husband’s daughter had to leave to head back home.  While driving on the highway ramp, both my husband and daughter saw a huge blue flash coming down through a cloud.  The blue beam was not perfectly symmetrical.

I and one of my brothers were visiting our brother in Reno, Nevada over Christmas.  His house is in the Cold Springs Valley area!  I stepped outside his garage to have a cigarette, on the side of his home.  It was still dark outside, but with a faint glow of the sun just barely starting to lighten the sky.  Not knowing exactly which direction his house faces, I will only suggest that I was on the east side of it at this time!  Being a believer of this type of thing, I always watch the skies in the hope that I will see something, and this time I did!  I was looking upwards, and I had high thin clouds to my right, but the skies were mostly clear.  I looked to my left more, and caught a fain object shoot past my field of vision at a very high rate of speed!  And I mean fast!  As I said, maybe only 2 seconds of viewing time!  What ever it was, it was not at an altitude to be lit by any sunlight because there was only a hint of lightening of the sky at this early hour!  And I saw it for such a short time span, than I can&#39;t even tell you what shape it was, either!  It was there, and then gone!  It&#39;s size I would approximate as being about the size of a pencil eraser, held about 8-10 feet away, looking straight on.  I went inside and told my brothers about this and one suggested that it might have been a bird!  But this was way too fast to be a bird!  And the other, which I tend to partially agree with suggested that it might have been a meteor!  The one problem I have with this is that I don&#39;t know a great deal about celestial bodies, but this seemed an awful lot closer to the ground than a meteor!  I would say no farther than 7-9,000ft above me!  I tried to follow it&#39;s path, to see if it would reflect any light from somewhere, but, nothing! It was pretty faint, and was gone really too quickly!<n>

At first I thought that the lights were just a really clear constellation, but despite their brightness in comparison to other objects, they were also hazy as if each had a fog around them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Each time that I would look back at the cloud ( I was driving in the same general direction each time) I noticed that something about the formation of the lights would change.  For instance, there would be three lights in stead of five or one light instead of five.  Eventually, there were no lights left in the circular pattern around the cloud, and then the cloud seemed to become brighter than before.  By this time, I had pulled over at an overlook point which provided a decent view of a portion of Medina Lake and turned off the ignition, and I could see that the cloud that I had been watching was over the lake.  I watched as a bright, small line of white light stretched out in the center of the largest point of the cloud (the cloud was comparable in shape to a large turkey baster, with the activity taking place at the “bulb” of this cloud “turkey baster”).  The light was a perfectly straight line that then shrunk back to nothing.  At this time, I started my car and left! the scene and started driving again.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

They moved silently, and more quickly than anything I&#39;ve ever seen.  They formed a vertical line, then a diamond and what appeared to be a crescent shape with a line, like the profile of a baseball cap.  They continued to move, then the light began fading and reappearing.  Eventually they disappeared in an upward direction.  We tried to use our cell phone cameras, but the image would not photograph.  The duration was approximately 3 minutes.  It was incredible.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

At around 7:40 pm CDT, I drove to a corner store, about one mile from my house, for a package of little cigars and a coke to see what remained of our first ‘white Christmas’ in 83 years (before I was born!).<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I returned to my car from inside the store where I had visited with the owner for a few minutes or so, something caught my eye low in the due northern sky: a yellowish/white broad light that was not shining at me, or out in front of the object, but was ‘glowing’ downwards, but not casting a ‘beam’ of light! I thought, how strange, but then the brisk cold air got to me so I hurried on home to see if I could get a better look at this, thing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Less than five minutes later, or, about 7:46 to 7:48 pm CDT, I parked my car at home and walked to my porch and looked up to the lower southern sky and saw this HUGE rear end of what could not have been an airplane, as it was only a few hundred feet off the ground, and the rear lights were perfectly huge!  There were four of them, two yellowish/white and two reddish/white, perfectly circular, spaced one after the other (white, red, white, red) in a roll in shape with a red blinking light in the middle or, possibly in the bottom area, when I thought it was likely an airplane, but I heard no sound whatsoever.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What I was looking at, that was gliding so slowly that if it had of been some known aircraft; it would have fallen from the sky, seemed to me to be the rear end of a triangle-shaped UFO I have seen graphics of and some videos of from eyewitnesses.<n> <n><n> <n><n> These lights were not bright, did not give off a ‘brightness glow’ nor were they hard to look at, yet they were soft in their illumination.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The huge object was almost hovering as it was gliding so slowly. I watched it moving towards the due south, and I know where the due south is from my front yard, having a compass watch that I calculate with every season, plus I know my star charts, being a former Navy SeaL and navigator.<n> <n><n> <n><n> These four lights were perfectly round and did not blink at all: only the small red light blinked in an odd manner unlike the belly lights found on traditional aircraft that blink in a continuous series as a warning. I know this from having once worked for Delta Airlines as a Fuel Service Agent. This little red light would blink real fast, and then stop, and then blink real fast a few seconds later, and stop.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was very awed, despite my past in witnessing and videotaping such oddities we call UFOs, standing out in the 30F odd degree cold night air, as I truly believed that I was seeing the rear end of a triangle shaped UFO gliding southwards, ever so slowly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The area where the large lights were located was a perfectly boxed-in area, or squared off with the lights within.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Now, I had my camcorder just inside my house on the coffee table, as I had been taking footage of the very rare snow that we had gotten yesterday afternoon, 12/24/2009, for the first time since 1926, as the TV news had related.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When my camcorder came to mind, the object had traveled farther away to the due south, although I thought I could get some footage of it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I decided to watch it instead, as if I had of gotten footage by that time of watching it for about four minutes, it would have been seen as simply colored lights that I described above in the cold night air, becoming smaller as it traveled slowly away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> CONCLUSION:  This object was too huge and flying too low and silently to have been any known, earthly aircraft! Because of the placement of the huge circular lights to the rear of the object; rule out any earthly aircraft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> These were not ‘fixed winged lights’ that shine out in front of airplanes, as this object was heading away from me to the south, plus the fact of its slow rate of speed and freezing night air; rule out a horizontal hot air balloon of any type based upon little to no wind and the object was moving in such a fixed position that it did not vary even slightly!  I affirm that the above is true and correct as I have described.<n>

I know how satellites move. My mum and aunt also witnessed this same object the weekend before last. They watched as t hovered and moved slowly above the tree tops. Then later on again that night around 9:25 I saw it again out the bathroom window, very red this time, it also appeared to be moving slower than before, it was very very bright, I ran outside to watch it again, then again as it got close! r to the road it picked up speed and moved upwards and vanished. My dad witnessed it with me and he is a chief engineer, he commented how odd it made no sound and appeared to be pulsating heat and the way it moved was in a most intelligent way, a careful way. I will be watching out again tonight.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Next, there was a flash of light, brighter than the sunshine.  When our vision recovered we realized we were surrounded on all sides by these crafts.  After 20 stressful mins the hatches to the crafts slowly began to open. A thick fog or smokey substance rolled out.  The creatures then began to imurge. A dozen or so, small, brownish, with a kind of liquid skin.  They spoke telepathically, the conversation started out with the advacement of quantum mechanics and led swiftly to current politics.  What i believe to be the &#39;leader&#39; of one craft took my hand and led us into the larger of the crafts.  The next thing I remember is waking up naked by the river.<n>

December 25, 0:26 I looked out my window to sky toward the East and saw a helicopter, and as I looked closer, I saw further in the distance 3, hovering, cylindrical, lighted objects (looked almost florescent), which were hanging vertically. (about 3 inches long, measuring with my thumb and first finger). I went outside to look at them closer and they just hung there.  I thought they were going to make letters so I ran in to get my camera and ran back outside.  They had moved to the North about the same distance in the sky, one then started to move from vertical to horizontal, to the left, very quickly.  Then it disappeared directly to the North.  I was only able to snap 2 shots and only captured the image in one photo.  The photographic image shows an additional circular globe.  All the images then just disappeared.<n>

We both were startled when I looked in my rear view mirror and noticed a rather large yellow laser beam track from 20 feet behind my truck going over my truck and down the hood.  There was nothing in the sky when we looked up.  I keep going over what it could be in my mind and I have no idea.  It was directly overhead where it came from and the possibility of how it could have been so precise is beyond me.  I wasn’t going to report it but I think it is more important to report an incident when it happens just in case any others saw it as well.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Need to download them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The event happend last night 11/24/09 around 11:35pm. The camera has the exact time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first I noticed an orange light travelling from the NW slowely cruising towards the East. The bright light dimmed and got brighter at random. It then stoped and hovered at an unkown altitude. With the naked It did not have a shape other than looking like a bright star or airplane with landings lights down at a distance. I did attempt to take video with my camera however it was too dark to do so. However I did take still pictures in ISO mode that reavealed more than I expected after zoom-in. The first picture shows a clear half circle shaped object. The second a posibly distorted image of the craft-- hard to discribe. Then a third picture resembles an object exploding from each side with a unaffected center.  Now I mentioned 10 objects, and here is a bizzar twist. The main ship released mulitple other craft or objects... they dropped from the bottom of the main craft, each dropping hundreds ( there was a red beam or gas emitted from each smaller craft as they fell)of feet before flying away in a controlled manner in a North direction. I know it sounds crazy!  The main craft then simply dissapeared. After the sightings I proceeded to take a picture of a planet (jupiter maybe, similar brightness to the object)or star, I took a picture of an aircraft flying in the area, and finally the moon as a reference or comparison check for a technician. Other large commercial aircraft were flying around during this time. Perhaps there are reports from pilots or other! viewers.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Upon request I can send digital copies of the image for analysis. I am curious as to what will be revealed.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Yet  when I look out side I cant explain what i saw9 it was at least a dozen lights that seemed uf orgainzed and ramdonly placed in the sky ) it at first looked like radio tower lights, but when we went up a hill they seemed to be hunderds of feet in the air, and unlike radio lights they never blinked  and they seemed to move slowly  north ward we could see th! em in the car for a mile of so but then they seemed to disappear. my brother and I seem to be the only people who saw this, for no one is fileing a report with you or anyone else. we saw the object thruoght the south moving north toward Logan airport, I am 14 A girl in the 8th grade my brother is a boy 12 he is in the 5th grade.

As I proceeded from the traffic lights I noticed two red circles to the south-east.  I pulled to the side of the road and signalled to other our family in the car ahead to pull over.  We all witnessed two slow moving red lights about drawing pinhead size, one behind the other. At first we thought they were helicopters but no navigational lights were visible and there was no audible sound. They flew together for a short time then one changed course.  We all joked that they were checking out the house of lights and my d-i-l suggested it was Santa arriving with Rudolph! As one faded into the western sky it no longer glowed but appeared as a pinprick constant red light.  We continued to see them as we walked to view the house and as my husband and I returned to East Auckland we spotted the lights again - this time two side by side and one on top.  We quickly searched for a safe spot to stop the car but they had disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The Auckland Herald also reported strange lights over Tauranga the same night but the Police had no reports of other sightings.  I did not report our sighting other than to this site.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It changed formation and moved on a curve several times.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is probably going to sound crazy, but I can’t explain what I saw tonight.  My husband saw it too, he thinks it was just a plane, but he can’t explain how the lights possibly looked if they were a plane.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We went to Disneyland tonight.  We got off the Nightmare before Christmas ride and were walking back towards the lake when I saw 3 multicolored lights in the sky over the lake in triangular formation.  Disney normally has this light show over the lake, where they project lights and movies onto water fountains that shoot out of the lake.  I though the lights were something for the show, and I pointed them out to my husband and told him I wanted to see what they were doing for the light show.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As we walked, the lights were moving slowly upwards.  I still thought they had to do with the show, until we got over next to the lake and no one was there because there was no light show.  We could still see the triangular formation moving up and to the right.  I asked my husband what it was, and he said it had to be a plane.  But the lights did not stay in one formation, they changed places.  I could tell because each one was a different color, and they switched as they moved. I kept telling my husband to look, and asking him what he thought it was, but he couldn’t answer.  He said it was a plane, then that it was too foggy to tell, but I know what I saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The lights moved up and to the right, and finally, and turned to look at my husband and when I looked back they were gone.  I’ve thought it over 100 times, and I don’t know what it was. They did not move in a straight line, they changed formation, they were much closer to the park when I saw them than when they disappeared.  Even if there had been a light show it couldn’t have explained this.   I know it sounds completely crazy to say you saw a UFO at Disneyland, but I have no explanation for what I saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have photos, but they are long exposures and not very good, but you can see in the few shots that they are getting dimmer.  I could see them for probably about 2-3 minutes.<n>

A few weeks ago a similar incident was reported to the Jewell County Sheriff’s office.<n> <n><n> <n><n> According to Sheriff Dave Fullerton, the cause of the recent bull’s death has not been determined.  The animal was found and reported to the sheriff’s office last Tuesday by Jim Harris.  The bull was owned by Mike Harris but running in Jim Harris’ pasture.  It was found in a remote low area of a pasture located on 140 Road about one-third mile north of V Road.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The bull was last seen by Jim Harris the prior Thursday afternoon so the time of death has been placed between that afternoon and its discovery the following Tuesday.<n> <n><n> <n><n> According to Fullerton, the bull had one ear and other body parts cut off.  Since the bull was  lying on its right side, the sheriff could not see if the other ear of the right eye had been cut.  He observed, &#34;There was blood around the eye, on the left side and indications that it was partly cut, in an attempt to remove it as had been done in the other bull mutilation.&#34;  Fullerton said the person or person’s responsible, did not finish cutting out the tongue, eye or eyes, as had been done in the other mutilation.  He noted, &#34;Something may have interrupted whoever is responsible and caused them to leave the scene before they completed the act.&#34;<n> <n><n> <n><n> Fullerton checked for tracks in the snow but could only find cow tracks.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The bull thought to be mutilated a month ago was found in a pasture north of Burr Oak.

The t.v is on the floor and there is a window right above the t.v.<n> <n><n> <n><n> the curtain to the window was wide open and we had a full view of the sky from where we was sitting. As I noticed the large craft flying very low, I would guess about 10 stories up, my nephew says &#34;Wow!&#34; and I immediately knew what he was saying wow for as I was thinking the same thing. We both saw a very large triangle shaped craft, it was very bright we could see the bottom of the craft as it was flying away from us, it had flown right over our house! I mean directly over top of our house. It had several brightly colored lights on the bottom and it was the size of a jet liner. I would think that I would have herd the craft but I didn&#39;t hear anything. If a plane would have been flying over head at that altitude it would have shook the house with the force of a hurricane. I didn&#39;t hear nothing, didn&#39;t feel nothing, and if we had not seen it I would have never even knew it was there. It was as if it was just gliding along. This did not scare me at all.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I wouldn&#39;t mind knowing! what it was, I figure it is some kind of military craft that no one knows of.  My nephew seems to think it was definitely from out of this world.  Whatever it was, it was real and I saw it.<n>

Dix / McGuire AFB Broad daylight!<n> <n><n> <n><n> While observing the moon over McGuire AFB to the east something caught the corner of my eye kind of overhead at 90 degrees. As I looked up I observed 2 oval shaped objects about half the length of a commercial airliner. The objects appeared silvery almost liquid silver. They were approximatley 1/2 half a mile from each other moving from west to east - towards the Ft.Dix / Mcguire AFB location. These objects moved at a high rate of speed at least 8-10 times faster than any commercial or military craft that I have seen in my lifetime. As they traveled parallel to each other towards the military installations I observed each one of them simultaneously split into 2 craft making now a total of 4. This must be about 10-13 seconds into the observation at this point they were approximatley over or very near the bases now and I observed all 4 of the objects turn abruptly to the north and immediately vanish.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I stood there looking around to see if someone else was around that maybe saw this I took my cell phone out to call my wife and tell her of this extraordinary incident, I looked to the sky where this began and there was a single one flying even faster than the first ones. I had the cell phone inmy hand ,hit the camera button on the side aimed as quickly as I could hoping to capture this on my phone. I was gone in 5 -10 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Not a sound at all was heard from this. What is even more odd is the air traffic during this time and even 5 mins afterwards was non-existant. I am dumfounded by this and hope that I read about someone else that maybe saw these things.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Early in the morning of 12/22/09, I went out to have a smoke at around 4:30 am to have a smoke.  I looked up to the east side of town to see a light flying from north east to south west.  It was bright enough for me to think it may be an airplane, but as I looked for any sign of blinking lights, I found none.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was excited that finally I had seen something without the blinking lights so I looked on.  I was careful to listed for noise of which I heard none.  The light then sort of fizzled out and dissapeared.  I have seen many satellites, and this was much brighter than that.   Almost like a helicopter spot light from a distance with no noise.  I really didn&#39;t think too much of it at the time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The next morning 12/23/09, I went out at about 3:10 am to have another smoke.  The previous incident was still on my mind as I walked out there.  I was in the middle of thinking how unlikely it would be to see something again, when I looked up and there it was again!  This time it was even a bit brighter than before.  Same, no blinking lights, no  sound.  Flying from northeast to southwest, only this one had a more southerly direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I actually walked down the road about 500 ft to follow it&#39;s course.  I could clearly see it shining through some trees before it moved out into the open.  Very  whitish light, similar to a spot light on a helicopter.  NO NOISE!  It appeared to stop and start a couple of times and then blinked out again!  It could have been miles away for all I know, but based on the very bright clear light it was producing, it seemed much closer. I would estimate that it was no more than a miles distance at the very most.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am aware there is an airport on the north side of town.  I am also aware of what airplanes look and sound like, as well as helocopters.  I lived in L.A. and saw police helicopters all the time.  And there are no blimps or hot air balloons around here.  This was making zero noise with NO blinking lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I even checked a satellite tracking site to see if there were any flyovers scheduled for that time and saw none.  The international space station was somewhere over Hawaii at the time and flying from west to east.  So I ruled that out.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Not sure what it was, but I already know they exist so I&#39;m not freaked out.  Just wanted to see if possibly anybody else has seen something in my area.<n>

I kept looking in the direction of the flash and within 2 min of seeing the flash I noticed a long, narrow cigar shaped object jet across the sky silently and very, very fast.  It left behind a slight trail of light and was gone like that! Never before have I seen anything like this before.  It was a clear night also.  The only thing I can reference the shape to was a cigar.<n>

Northeast to Southwest or reverse.   Depending upon atmospheric conditions the light may appear bright white or blue .. again also depending upon the aircraft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There is also a famous Vineyard in the area and the owner employs a Lear Jet in his travels - often flying low.  No noise is heard until the aircraft is close or passes overhead.  The local airport is nearby and low approach speed maintains an optical illusion of a non-moving object when approaching HEAD ON to the viewer..<n> <n><n> <n><n> Lexington also falls under a main sky route hub between Greensboro/Winston-Salem and Charlotte and it is not unusual for heavy air traffic .... the planes often employ landing strobes .. but the actual ONCOMING path makes it appear stationary until they get overhead and then one can see the FAA required aircraft lights (i.e. green/red .... varied blinking lights, wing lights, etc.) .<n> <n><n> <n><n> Many others have seen similar objects and mistook them for ... Unidentified, until that typical jet noise &#34;catches up&#34;.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am not sure if this applies to the above situation, but may be a possible explanation.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This evening I have seen many .... heavy air traffic ... some small aircraft ... strobes are flashed when they are approximate to each other.  TWO in particular were unusual and did NOT follow the normal flight route; however I had assumed that they were the result of heavy inbound/outbound air traffic (Holiday) and may have been put on a &#34;holding&#34; pattern.  The night was very clear, the aircraft did NOT make noise, but assumed (again) the sound would follow.  It didn&#39;t; however the movement was consistent with usual flight speed with no deviations from a straight course, nor any change in speed.  Both objects moved from NORTH to SOUTH, EACH about ten minutes apart - EACH taking about ten minutes to cross.  The ONLY thing unusual were that there were NO FAA lights .. just a solid white light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Note:  Many dogs in the area were howling during this ... particular sighting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Nothing follows, nor is follow-up necessary.

There was a small mowed yard on my right surrounded by small trees. As you drive east past the trees at the end of the small yard there is a field on the right side of the road and still trees on the left side.  There is a very nice house built in this field by its self.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At 21:00 on 12/22/2009 as I was driving east along the small yard when I noticed threw the tree to the east in front of me what look like to me at the time two sparks from a bonfire rising into the air and rolling over the top away from me like they were gliding on the wind.   I saw this twice before I pass the trees. When I passed the trees and entered the edge of the field looking now south. I saw that what I thought was sparks was to small lights.  They seemed to be flying in perfect formation. One would rise into the sky and the other would follow in perfect sync copying what the other done perfectly. I got out of the car and watch the small lights rise into the sky then roll over and come back down like floating on air but again in perfect sync.  They then did the same thing over the house. They then rose into the sky and started east.  The front light did a corkscrew move and the one behind it did the same corkscrew move.  They then both drop down at the field still I sync! heading still east. Then rose up over the trees and gone.  The trees were on a knoll so when they went over the trees they dropped over the knoll and out of my sight. I did not see them after that.  I didn’t hang around very long either because I was a little spooked.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The whole sighting from the time I saw what I thought were sparks till they were out of my sight was no more then a minute total.  The strange thing was these lights looked small. They looked only the size of a person or maybe a little bigger but not much. I could use the house and trees as a reference and to me they looked small. I am no expert on judging objects in the sky and I my be wrong but to me they could not have been bigger then a small car if that big.<n>

All 4 people in the car noticed strange lights to our left out the window (the window was down in the car) above a large farm type building surrounded by empty land (crops had been cut).  We watched these white lights-they were very, very close together (if they were planes, they would’ve crashed) and started out as horizontal 8 lights (4 each craft), one craft directly behind the other.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As we continued to watch (and stopped the car in the road), they quickly switched places so they were beside each other-8 lights in a row.  They continued to move around each other as they headed off North towards York, PA.  They were a couple hundred feet above the ground during these few minutes.  They were not traveling very fast, just very mobile around each other.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Both craft seem to have a disc shape and we could all see the bottom of their craft ! as it was a very dark color that was definitely contrasted by the dark sky (the night was clear).  The lights were all white-no colored lights or blinking lights such as a plane would have.  One team member did get a picture but it didn’t turn out very well and is not worth attaching.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We are hoping someone else reported this in our area too!<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

We went outside for a cigarette.  It was dark outside and overcast.  I live in a small suburb community a couple of miles from town, there are not a lot of street lights around here, so the street is not well lit.  One strange thing that we noticed was that all of the dogs in the neighborhood were barking.  We first saw the object to the right of us.  At first the object was an intense neon blue light, bar shaped at first.  The object would hover and cruse just below the overcast clouds line circling us, flying slowly and changing altitudes.  Its movements were smooth quiet and squared.  The light would change its shape, having a few different light patterns on the craft.  When the craft seemingly noticed us it put on a display of unnatural and impossible maneuvers; Moving from a dead stop to unimaginable speeds in an i! nstant, making 90 degree turns at high speed, then coming to a complete stop, all the while moving without a sound. I told my wife to get the camera so we could take a picture.  She ran into the house to grab the camera but every time we tried to take a picture the craft would pulse and the battery power would be drained. Then we would mess with the camera and it would come back on with battery power but when we tried to take the picture again, the same thing would happen. Finally when the craft was at its furthest points away from us we could get a shot of it, three in total. When we captured it, the craft would react. With the first snapshot, the flash failed to flash, and the craft returned and put on a display of its maneuvers, then continued to circle us. The second snapshot again with no flash. The craft came right in front of us, banked its angle and exposed its shape to us. All I could tell was that it was pure black with blue lights. The bar light turned into severa! l individual lights fading off and on. I could see that it was! triangl e in shape. I couldn’t easily see the shape because the craft was dark and I was too focused on the lights. Then the ship would again start to circle us. Still when the craft was close to us it would turn our camera off. So my wife handed me the camera to see if I could get it to work when my wife screamed, “O my god look at that!” I looked up at the craft; it had a beam of light going to the ground with a red orb returning to the ship. I didn’t get to see the whole event with the orb because I was looking at the camera but my wife witnessed the whole thing. The orb returned to the craft and it began circling again. I gave the camera back to her she got the third picture; the best one. The third time the camera flashed. The craft turned to face us and closed the gap of distance from where it had been, to where we were. It sat just above the neighbor’s house. We were looking at what I believed to be the front of the craft. The craft fired a pulse of light towards us and I cou! ld feel a surge travel through my whole body, and my car was popping as if the sheet metal was warping. Then the craft began to circle again. We noticed that the phones were now working again and I was able to talk to my parents and franticly tried to explain to them what was happening. I thought we can’t be the only ones to see this so I ran across the street to get the neighbors outside to see this as well. I knew they were home and I could hear them in there. I was franticly knocking on the door and ringing the door bell, but no one would answer. Soon enough a car was pulling down the street it was my wife’s mom. We yanked her out of the car to see it. Then three minutes after she arrived home, the craft was gone. It disappeared in the overcast clouds. After all of this excitement I noticed that where the craft was flying it had opened a hole in the thick overcast clouds that took a few minutes to fill back in, revealing the night sky above. In total the event lasted abo! ut 30 – 40 minutes. This has been a very emotional event for m! e and my wife. We both had bad migraine headache for the next two days and my life has been permanently changed.<n>

It was the color of the blue part of the flame in your cigarette lighter.  The outside of the flame is orange red, but the inside of the flame is beautiful blue.  Just like this.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This craft came closer to my house this time.  I am not sure it was the same type of craft I saw last time since this one had a head and a tail and seemed to be in the shape of a diamond, or cross.  It also had running lights on the outstretched wings and tail.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am reporting this sighting to you because no conventional aircraft could maneuver the skies the way this guy did.  Like my last report, the craft went around the mountain just north east of the Reagan presidential library in Simi Valley, CA.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This time the craft was doing some very beautiful and tricky flying.  All of us saw it.  I called my roommate Alex so he saw it too.  It feels good that so many of us saw it in the back yard.  Alex and I were the only adults.  The rest were children ranging from 4 years to 12 years.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It occurs to me that my grandson’s father works for a company that manufactures government drones not too far from this site and this may be a test run of one of their machines.  I only know that this thing moved very fast and circled the area of over 3 miles in seconds doing acrobatics whilst in flight.  It was cool.  I want one!!!!!<n>

Then realized there was another object just behind and to its right.  As I focused, I realized there were 6-8 objects, all flying at same speed and altitude, in no particular pattern.  Thought the first one was a passenger jet because it appeared to be high up and moving fast.  But commercial airliners do not travel that close together and do not, at cruising altitude, appear from the ground to travel as fast as those objects passed over my house.  There was no sound, no exhaust trail.  Objects appeared to be silver metallic and/or reflecting the sun&#39;s light.  Could not tell their shape due to sun&#39;s brightness/reflection and distance.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

Bright blue light flying to the left, bright red flying to the right. 2nd sighting over same spot as 12/11/09 sighting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is my second report of the same lights I saw on December 11th. Once again, I saw a bright blue light in the sky flying to my left. It would stop, fly back to the right, and turn a bright red. The light would occasionally dip, hover, rise back up again, and quickly fly off. It&#39;s main pattern seemed to be flying in circles over one particular spot near the horizon. I believe that it&#39;s possible someone is flying some sort of model plane or helicopter from a baseball field, which is under that part of sky I witnessed the lights flying above. This ballpark is near Poinsettia Ln and Ambrosia Rd in Carlsbad. My concern, if this is the case, is that the lights are extremely bright and too close to Palomar Airport. They are not the normal red and green navigation lights, which could confuse other pilots landing and taking off from the nearby airport. Even if this is a normal plane, which I doubt due to it&#39;s behavior in the sky, these lights were much brighter th! an a small plane would be from that same distance. This time I contacted local PD just to have it reported on a non-emergency line and the light descended shortly there after I ended my phone call. I do not believe an officer was able to see the lights in time.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

They moved very slowly from south to southwest.  I know they were not planes or helicopters, they moved too slowly.  I do know a little about astronomy, the ISS and space shuttles.  I make it a habit to know when the shuttle is orbiting with the ISS and watch for it.  Point being I could tell these two objects were very high in the sky and did not seem to be within our atmosphere.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This lasted about ten minutes.  When I noticed them they were almost in line with each other.  One was on the left, the other to the right but a little below.  The one on the right moved very slowly from the right towards the bottom of the other while it was motionless.  Once in line straight up and down, they both traveled from south to southwest very slow then slowly faded away as you would see the shuttle do when it leaves the reflection of the sun.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What I thought was interesting was that they faded away while moving to the west towards the suns light.  It also may be that they only appeared to move to the west.  It may be possible that they were going deeper into space.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This occurred in the town of Campbell, Ca.  I am hoping someone else saw the same thing from a long distance away.  This would prove that these objects were in space.<n>

The big craft was moving forward and spinning at the same time, but very slowly, the smaller crafts were much faster in their irregular motions but moving forward with big object at the same speed.  All three were flying together in the same direction, NE.  The objects were totally silent. We have no idea what that was but it was very beautiful to watch. We do not have pictures or videos.<n>

I went to the location that they mentioned a couple of times after they called but never seen anything so I decided that I would go out and look in the direction that she pointed out then a few weeks went by but  eventually on December 18, 2009 I witnessed a big bright pure white flash.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I looked at it and I seen a light go up into some kind of compartment as it was about half way up the object it reflected light onto itself and I could see an oval shape and I could see where it looked like the light might stop then it did stop there and then I could not see it anymore.  The first thing one may think of if they see this object flash is that a picture was taken. I am still watching out for it here when weather permit&#39;s.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
12/18/09|Norton/Attleboro|MA|||December 2009 UFO Crash/Landing in Norton/Attleboro, MA Area night of Snowstorm.|12/20/12|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/094/S94815.html|128|ndxe200912| December 2009 UFO Crash/Landing in Norton/Attleboro, MA Area night of Snowstorm<n> <n><n> <n><n> On a December night in 2009, my then girlfriend at the time and I saw an unidentified flying object crash to the ground in Norton, MA.  I am not sure exactly what the date was, but am sure that it was prior to Christmas 2009.  Potentially a week or so before.  She picked me up at my residence on East Main Street in Norton, MA around 9 or 10 PM, as she was sent home early from her evening shift due to the snow storm.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The snow at the time was heavy, wet and about six inches, it accumulated very quickly.  She even got her car stuck in the snow and my friends had to help her get back on the road by pushing the car...it was so slick out that her tires just spun.  It took about 6 adult males to get the car back in the street.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Both she and I were 30 at the time.  We are both college educated.  Her father is a retired FBI agent, her brother an active agent.  My father was the CEO of a major international company for a while and at that time the CEO of a start-up.  Both my girlfriend at the time and I were completely sober.  I know that I and she had not taken any alcohol or substance for months, as our relationship was based around staying clean.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After she picked me up and my friends helped push the car back on the road, we headed South West East Main Street in Norton past Wheaton College toward downtown Norton.  Wheaton College was only 1/4 a mile from my residence.  We were in the car for only about 3 mins, sliding all over the road, when we saw an object that appeared to be glowing green come shooting from the sky down to earth.  The object was not a refection on the falling snow, believe me.  It was very clear through the storm due to how bright it was.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We we heading on East Main Street (Rt 123) heading South West when we saw the object appear from seemingly no where, it was very bright and was glowing green and falling at the speed of a jet.  The object was falling from the Southwest, but more west than south.  So we were coming towards rte 123 and 140 in Norton towards Norton Center and if you had norton center as south, the object fell at the west.  I am not sure of the shape, as it was falling too fast and the green light around it had yellow, red and white on it...  I thought and still think it was a meteor and in fact reported it to an online meteor sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object was very very clear, snow or no snow, there was no obstruction, it was big and bright and moving extremely fast as though falling out of the sky.  The last I saw it was to heading about 5 miles west of Norton Center (where we were heading) and it disappeared below the tree line.  The object was in the sky long enough for me to point it out to my then girlfriend who said something like holy s#@t what is that and, because she was driving so slow due to the snowstorm and since no one was on the road (it was a really really bad storm), she was easily able to see it to.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It’s hard to say what it was, it could have been a meteor, a ufo. It could have been a rectangle, square or round, I don’t know.  It appeared round because it was falling and had a greenish, yellowish, whitish orb and tail around it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 100% if was not flying across the sky, I have seen many a shooting star and this was close, in our atmosphere and crashed somewhere probably near the Norton, Attleboro line.  We saw it go from the sky, get bigger and closer and it was heading directly to the ground.  There is a small regional airport in Norwood, MA, it was not a plane, you would not have been able to see a plane in that storm and this object was very clear and broke through the clouds at a speed that small planes cannot get to.  It also very clearly hit the ground, we saw it go below the trees...no fireball, nothing like that, not plane crashes reported.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What I want to know is did anyone else see this object, this bright glowing object falling to the ground in Norton, MA on December of 2009 during the snowstorm.  My then girlfriend and I saw it. Both of us had never seen a UFO before.  I assume all UFO’s are government crafts, don’t really believe in aliens, but I’ve been proven wrong before.  All I know is that we had clear minds, were in the act of falling in love and both audibly were shocked by the object that we saw crash to earth. We both said well, that must be a meteor, but who knows.  It was soooooo bright someone, someone, a plow driver, someone must have seen it too.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date is approximate.  PD))<n>

Next thing I know I saw a shiny bright white circle of light.  I thought it was a helocopter spot light but it wasn&#39;t.  I stopped and looked at it for 10 mins.  It stayed in one spot, moving flat across the sky really slowly.  I continued to ride my bike down the road and it was just hovering in one spot.  I lost it above the tree line.  I kept riding and I saw it again when the trees got smaller.  I got to my road and next thing you know it dissapeared.<n>

We were coming home from bowling in separate cars, driving along Turnpike Road in Willington about 9 pm.  Near the intersection of Moose Meadow Road I saw a Blue sphere hovering in the distance --then all of a sudden it zig and zag and speed off.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I looked ahead as I was driving and thought I saw two blue-ish objects off in the sky that were not moving like a typical aircraft would but they were far enough away that I could not tell their exact shape.  These two objects did appear to have another red colored lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I did not say anything to my wife as she is skeptical.  Then last night (12/19/09) I was telling my son about it on our way home from picking him up at the train station and my wife says --&#34;oh ya I meant to tell you I saw it too.  She said it was weird as it moved real fast after it was stationary.  She actually said she thought to herself it was a UFO<n>

There were 3 lights on each side and I believe 2 on the backside. The ‘front’ end was open, as the side lights did not meet at a point.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At approximately 21:00 hours I stepped outside on my front porch to smoke a cigarette.  I live close to an Air Force Base and the City Airport, less than 5 miles.  I have seen many military aircraft fly over my house, including the Stealth Bomber.  I have also worked at the airport for about 3 years.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I looked up at the stars I saw orange lights moving from North to South at a height of the same as a landing aircraft.  I did a double take when I realized it was not an airplane, or one that I would have recognized as there were no standard aircraft lights visible.  I tried to knock on the front window to get my wife’s attention, but to no avail.  I went to the street to follow the lights as they went south over my house and disappeared.  The event lasted about 5-15 seconds. I do not know if the lights vanished or disappeared in the distant haze.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I did not see any type of body and the lights appeared they would be on the bottom of a craft.  I am uncertain if this was one craft or several in formations.  There was no sound at all.<n>

I was facing north east when I saw two star-like objects just above the Berkeley hills.  I paused for awhile to look thinking that these maybe falling stars but the trajectory of the movements were about horizontal (zig-zagging smoothly) and one star-like object following (chasing?) the other.  These two star-like objects looked about 5-10x larger than an airplane in the night sky but moving much faster (maybe &gt;&gt; 20x ).  The objects were also much closer to the ground.  The objects were in the sky for about 5-10 seconds before disappearing in the horizon at a much faster speed.  The star-like objects&#39; flickering “arms” were mostly white with a few red and blue.  I know how an airplane or helicopter looks like in the night sky and these star-like objects were very different.  These objects moved so much faster!<n>

I was parked across from N.H.&#39;s house on 1st Avenue, while my children walked their paper route nearby. I had the car stereo on so didn&#39;t hear anything (window closed). I was thinking how the sky was still rather cloudy but had a few clear patches, and I was wondering about how the upcoming weather would be.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My eyes were drawn to what I thought might be a &#34;falling star&#34; but it was greenish-yellow glowing (&#39;emerald green&#39;) It did make me think of something burning up after entering atmosphere as it was far higher than a flare might reach. I wondered about meteor showers but thought they&#39;d come in multiples. It lasted maybe 3-5 seconds, long enough for me to form some thoughts and wonder about it 	There was a plane trail quite far to thte left of where this occurred, but unrelated I think (The plane&#39;s path was towards the Coquihalla and Vancouver). One bright star was visible to the left of where I was the light show. The falling trajectory was not straight down, but at an angle.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Account 2: (Son, 13)  The yellowish-green sphere fell over the music fest area. It glowed yellow and green. It was around 5:00 pm. It was kind of 3-d. There were clouds behind it. It didn&#39;t make the clouds glow (no reflection), the clouds which were a medium distance behind it. No foreshortening on the side opposite the direction of movement. Like a falling star, falling across the sky. Nothing was heard, no sounds. Definitely a single light. No airplane trails. Lasted six seconds from the time I looked up to see it. Was looking across the street and I looked up and saw it. I was standing in front of L.B.&#39;s house, walked across the sandy area to the middle of the lawn of the house next door while watching. Not a solid, more a glowing ball of energy. Same size as a toonie. Mother also saw it. Weather was cloudy, not clear.<n>

We are both USAF veterans.  Most would consider us as reliable trained witnesses.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The sky was clear but dark as sunrise was not to occur for awhile.  Please note the time of this sighting. We were on a mountain trail approximately 9 miles East of Springerville and 5 miles South of Highway 60 and 1-1/2 miles East of the New Mexico Sate border.  We were climbing to attain the Mesa top by sunrise and hunting Elk at the time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In the Eastern sky, towards New Mexico from our position, at approximately 35 to 40 degrees above the horizon, a brilliant flash occurred.  It covered an area of approximately 1/10th of the sky.  The color of this strobe-like light was blue/white and in the shape of an upside-down U.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We both stared at the sky, awaiting some other sight, looking for the object that made this strobe-like light, however the sky was clear, full of stars, and no object was seen, only the impression of the light in our eyes, as it does when a flash is seen... it re-appears and and fades for a few minutes afterwards which is normal.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were hoping to see an object that could have made this &#34;blinding&#34; flash, but nothing could be seen.  No silhouettes, no shapes, no sounds, nothing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We discussed this sighting and neither of us have any experience with an aircraft or military flying object that could have caused this flash to occur.  Whatever it was, it is still unknown to us at the time of this report.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Please note:  This is not the first report of an unidentified sighting in this area that I have given.<n>

There were 5 people in the car including me, and we all saw the unknown object in the sky.  It was shaped like a flying saucer with blinking lights around it. It was hovering still for the 20 seconds that we got to see it.  I knew it was not an airplane because near it was an airplane and it was much smaller and the lights were different, the ufo looked bigger and closer.  We lost view of it because we were driving. We reached the house, which was not that far from the place we sighted it.  When we got out of the car to take a look it was not there anymore.  My friend’s mother went in the house and drew a picture of what she saw and it matched what we all saw.  The next day I told my food friend about my sighting and she told me that her friend also saw an unidentified flying object last night.  Her frien! d’s description matched mine and we both saw it at around the same time.  It was very noticeable and I’m pretty sure there must be a good amount of people who saw it.<n>

I didn’t make out any smoke or cloud trails from it, the background was the clear blue sky and the object was clearly visible.  It was above the sea much higher than the incidentally passing airplanes and at a much higher altitude than the building around me.  It moved to the left very slowly still above the sea and then stopped there for about 5 minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I called both my parents to ask them what they thought it was and none were able to answer.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then the object changed directions and moved to the right at a faster pace but still slow.   As it moved to the right (now over land) I lost sight of it because of the buildings facing me, so I moved to the other end of the balcony where it should be visible again and indeed there it was.  Now it was at a farther distance and it appeared as a black dot slowly moving to the right.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My parents and I followed it all the way until it disappeared behind the buildings and we couldn’t see it anymore.<n>

I didn&#39;t think anything of it at first but upon a closer look, I noticed it was moving downward in rapid spurts so decided to take a look with my binoculars.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I looked with my binoculars I could tell the object was no star and no aircraft.  It was a glowing light that changed colors and moved in spurts and when it moved it moved rapidly and not a slow gradual decline.  Eventually it moved past the hills on the horizon and I lost sight of it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have no idea what this object was.  They best way I could describe the object was it looked like a oval/diamond shaped object with smooth edges that glowed light a light bulb.  It resembled those orbs that people have described seeing in Arizona and didn&#39;t have any real form.  It made no sound whatsoever and it was light a light bulb that changed from very subtle colors of green, red and white.<n>

The unusual part was a few things, first, the four lights were not connected but if you focused in the lights you could see a faint light connecting all the lights together as if it were four lights on a string that would shift around as it moved through the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The second unusual part was that you could definitely see helicopters/airplanes following it like they were chasing it and as the helicopters/airplanes got closer the object would shift-shape and fly faster, i saw the object go from my left side of the car (north) to the front (east) to the right side (southwest) in less than a minute.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Now it was not making any sounds that i could tell just the sounds of planes and helicopters.  The only reason that I would come to conclusion that this could be a ufo is that I had seen these same actions on two different tv shows at two different dates on the history channel in which these exact descriptions were portrayed; four lights appearing to be shape shifting starting as a v then turning into a straight line kind of like Orion’s belt, but four lights, moving through the sky.  The other identifiable aircrafts were following it and having trouble keeping up. Again please let me know if there is another like story like this or if you know of aircrafts that do these kinds of actions thank you.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC NOTE:  Witness indicates that date of the sighting is approximate.

I am about 3 miles from home.  As I was driving down the main street I notice three lights in the sky in a straight line. The sky is typical heavy traffic area for planes heading to the St. Louis Airport, which is approximately 27 miles east of this occurrence.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What caught my eye was these lights were spread apart quite a bit, but consistent in distance and they were in a straight line and blinking in sequential order (1-2-3, etc.)  I thought that perhaps that what I was seeing was a tower of some sort that I didn’t notice before because it would be abnormal to see places flying in this formation.  Plus, these planes were not headed towards the airport, nor were they, from my position; coming from the direction of the main airport.  That’s why I thought they could be tower lights that warn low flying planes at night. But, that was not the case.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I continued down the main road (which is a busy road) I stretched to see them out my front and passenger window.  I don’t ever recall seeing lights like this as a steady fixture, so I was trying to think of what it could be.  Once I lost sight of the lights, since they were in my blind spot, I continued on and entered into my neighborhood.  Once I am in my neighborhood I have to back track towards where I came from to get to my house.  That’s when I saw the lights again.  It was clear that it was not a tower as they appeared to be moving west.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I ran in the house, asked my husband to go outside in the back yard and tell me what that is in the sky.  I didn’t even turn off my car or park it in the garage as I wanted him to see this and explain what it was that I was seeing before it was out of our sight line.  He is a 23-year military veteran and very familiar with various military air craft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Looking through the bare trees in our yard, he said he didn’t know, but was sure that military planes wouldn’t fly in such as straight line with lights that blinked sequentially.  I went in and grabbed the camera and went out front of the house to see if I could get a better view.  A house was blocking the view, so we got in the car.  We figured we could get to an open space and at least be able to get a better view.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Both of us thought to head west as that’s where it seem to be going towards, and we were going down a road that had  a wide open view of the sky.  We should have at least been able to see the object in the distance, but we drove a few miles and saw nothing but the normal air traffic that is common.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This was in a busy area, so I think that my husband and I can&#39;t be the only one to see this!  IF there is a logical explanation, it would be nice to know what that was flying over Missouri.<n>

The object slowly moved over my car and continued hovering.  It was triangular in shape and had a white light in each of the three corners of the triangular object with a bigger white light at its center.  From the side view it was rectangular and had multiple lights, three of which were flashing.  It slowly moved north towards Highway 10, over the neighborhood, and past Highway 26.  Then it headed west towards Saginaw and turned north.  It made a high pitched whirring sound like a turbine.  The object was black with all white lights.<n>

It was far enough away that I couldn&#39;t distinguish any shape or features- just kinda looked like a shiny white object.  I ruled out the possibility that this was a bird and it wasn&#39;t any sort of reflection on the windshield of my car.  This was definitely some type of aerial object that was VERY visible and just suddenly vanished after 10 seconds from when I first spotted it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> While watching the object, it &#34;blinked&#34; a couple times- like if you had a dimmer switch on a light bulb and dimmed the lights partially for half a second and then turned it back up.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This was the third occasion in the last couple months I have seen this phenomenon.  All three incidents occurred in the Kansas City area during my commute to work in the morning (different locations each time though).  Each time the object was very visible for about 10 seconds and then just vanished- didn&#39;t fly away, just quickly faded like a light going out.<n>

To the East and to the South East I noticed five lights hovering over the mountain in the distance that twinkled on and off several times in two to three second intervals before disappearing for five seconds and re appeared fifteen degrees to the east.  I estimate that the mountains I was approaching which the craft were on the other side of were ten miles away thirty degrees above the horizon.  It hovered motionless for several seconds and the objects turned white in color then converged into one bright white object and was gone.  I was able to have my passenger take two still photos of the object(s)which have some distortion of the image due to road vibration.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Approximately Forty Five Degrees to my left, I noticed another object hovering above the mountain at the same altitude as the first.  It hovered and disappeared after fifteen seconds. My passenger was able to film the craft and the one to follow a minute later using a 640 x480 pixel digital video recorder.  As he was filming another appeared directly ahead of us appeared but was gone too quickly to be filmed.<n>

However the beams were not all on the same line but had some depth to them.  It was like they came from a promotional spot light but were too many in number and covered an area far too great to be spot lights.  Also the lights were to my north and north east with nothing really out that way but country and small towns if anything.  No clue what they could&#39;ve been or seen anything like it before.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Five going down the long way and Four across.The space around it was jet black, darker than the sky at night in NEW YORK Black. But as soon as i saw it it stayed for only a few seconds then disappeared . i told my friend i saw a Ufo, but she said that ou cant see a UFo in New York , live right next to the airport.  But I know what I saw and it was bigger that a air plane.  It was a UFO.<n>

It sped by at a fast speed, then disappeared before it was even out of view!  I initially thought it to be a comet, but it occurred to me that it had neither a tail, nor a bluish hue.  Also having seen a comet on multiple occasions, the explanation did not satisfy me.  For a brief moment, I thought it might have been a firefly, but they don&#39;t fly around in 20 degree weather on a December night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I now have little doubt in my mind that this was a UFO!  I searched out whether or not people had similar sightings, then I came upon this website.<n> <n><n> <n><n> By the way, I live not too far from Montauk and Port Washington, both of them home to naval bases, and I&#39;ve heard speculation of other weird happenings in those areas.<n>

My next guess would have been a satellite since they sometimes do move pretty quickly across the night sky, but what caught my eye was that it zoom for a good distance it seemed to have slowed down and zoomed again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I followed this tiny light and noticed it kind of curved towards the western direction and it came to a hover this time there seemed to be more lights that I had not noticed earlier – it almost looked like a ! string of lights or set of lights.. it hovered and then started descending and moving back towards the East…ran inside to get my binoculars and see if I could take a better look, but when I got back with them – this thing was gone, I waited for a while as to see if I could see it again , but with no luck.<n> <n><n> <n><n> If anyone else has any information or saw the same thing, post something on here as to share information and compare notes.<n>

I was waiting at my front window when I noticed something in the sky. I noticed 2 diamond shaped lights, I studied them because of their vibrant deep orange colour. I watched how the &#34;lights&#34; seemed to play with each other, moving like no human aircraft could possibly move.  I noticed how one light seemed to follow the other, almost as if it was chasing it. The speed went from, rapid to slow back to rapid, speeds like I&#39;ve never seen. I noticed the lights plunge only to stop then shoot off in all kinds of directions.  I was absolutely amazed. After around 3 minutes, one of the lights seemed to go very small but still visable for a while, almost as if it wasmoving away. The second light waited for around 20 seconds then went really bright and bigger before disappearing in the same way- again almost like it was moving away. I studied the skies for some time after this and I saw nothing.  I believe that what I saw moved like! nothing human ever did. I have been left astonished, still looking at the skies at night- I never expected to see anything in such a small part of the world.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that she is studying to become a medical professional.

It was very fast, faster then any plane I have ever seen (and I have seen F-22 raptors. This was soo much faster.) I hope other people in the area saw it too.

I am not published as I do not have that aspiration, nor do I seek notoriety for my point of knowledge.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Briefly, we have been and are continually “visited” by those who intend no harm, but are seeking to communicate to us, the insanity of our ways.  Those “visiting”, have been in contact with the world governing class and have articulated their concern as nuclear aggression and the probability of detonation of those weapons on a large scale does effect the “space” where they are resident.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As many of you who are well versed in quantum science and have knowledge of the “visitors”, there are certain understandings that must be embraced.  An important item of knowledge and professional trust we must embrace, as we, the inhabitants of our planet, share a common space with various forms of energy, mass and conductivity.  Within the energy, mass and conductivity are media and presence that is (1) unseen, (2) unheard) and (3) un-quantified.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In its simplest description of fact, we are constantly, consistently and collectively aware there is a determined perception, postulated by the governing classes of the world; Un-identified Flying Objects do not exist. However, also within fact, they do exist.  The state of technology being used and that that has been given to us for many years allows “them” to come and go effortlessly, hidden beyond our visual color spectrum and below and above our frequency aspect.  In the same manner we have been given “stealth technology” and have used it successfully, “they” surpass the level of technology currently available to us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Their being and lack of presence is purposeful.  However, from time to time, with purpose, they make their presence known through frequency modulation into our “band width” of frequency perception and within our “spectrum” of visual color range.  Occasionally, the “sightings” are seen because of technological components that malfunction, causing the frequency and color range to fall within our ranges of sight, hearing and quantification.  It is clear; there is an ever present presence by the “visitors”.  There are an infinite number of parallel “space” that is occupied and is bound by frequency aspect and color spectrum that is different than ours.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There is much to know and understand.  But, knowing and understanding the “visitors” are here is not adequate.  We must challenge our governments worldwide to clearly state the truths as they know them.  There is an alliance between the “visitors” and those in the world governing class.  The “visitors” have been asked to cooperate with the world governing class and have shown great reserve as they believe the world is on a course that threatens the existence of the world population and at the same time threatens the “space” occupied by the “visitors”.  We need be clear in our understanding, nuclear holocaust or open physical contact with the “visitors” will occur in the very near future.

The sky was intermitinly clouded, mostly small clouds passing by. carried by a swift upper wind. at first I thought they were stars, but they were brighter than venus. then I thougth it was one airplane, but there were no flashing lights, then I noticed more of them too many to be airplanes. 50 to 60 all moving in the same direction from the eastern horizon to the west.  Some were in formations other were not.  There would be bursts of speed then very slow as if trying to pass for stars should anyone look up.  I had to ask others there if they were seeing what i was seeing and like me the first explanation was that they were planes, but the altitude was too high and their light to bright for anything conventional and the speed to great, not to mention the size they must have been to cast such a light at that altitude.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After they passed there was a brief period where the sky was just black then the stars! were all there in their normal  locations I stood there in disbelief while other said to call the police or someone.

As i passed the object out of my site, i took the next available exit to backtrack and investigate. I turned off into this vacant parking lot, parked and got out of my car. There at cloud level, above and out in front of me a ways, was this hovering object, silent, with 3 white lights. I looked through my binoculars and could hardly see what the object was. It was a very very dark object, I grabbed my digital camera and took a couple of pictures. After about 20 mintutes of dealing with object, i got in my car asnd proceeded home, which was about 30 miles away. When i got home and parked on the street in front of my home, I opened my car, only to look up and see this triangular object in the sky about cloud level near my home. This gets more bizzarre, during the Monday Ni! ght Football game on the 14th of Dec, between the 49ers and Cardinals, i decided gto go to the 7/11 store down the street from me. Before i made a right turn down the street, i noticed a vehicle in the sky, at a distance in front of me, it had a white light and a red strobbing light, as i made the right turn, i noticed the object began to move in the direction i was moving. As I sped up, so would the object, when i slowed down, so would the object. The street I was on comes to a T, where you have to make a right or make a left, I made a illegal U turn to see what the object would do, and to my amazement, the object was again going the same direction i was going, I hurried home and didnt even go to the 7/11 store because i was totally frightened. Since then every night when i go out , after about 15-20 minutes, these objects appear at a distance and track my every move, go in the same direction that i go. So to keep my sanity,  I asked my sister in law and nephew to take a r! ide with me and witness what i have been witnessing, and sure ! enough, they did see what i been seeing for the past week, they are one hundred percent sure as i am that i&#39;m being tracked. Why? I have no clue, how long will it continue? I have no clue. But i do know it&#39;s happening, i have witnesses. Its as strange and bizarre as it could be.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I saw two V shapes composed of roughly 10 individual UFOs each (like geese flying south).  Each V would hold its form at the tip of the two arrows; but the back of each V (2 or 3 UFOs) would move randomly for a brief moment, and then return to the V.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I followed the Vs down my apartment complex street for as long at they were in sight. The UFOs moved slightly faster then I could walk.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A man was walking down the street at the same time I was, (going to the bus stop).  He noticed the UFOs and tried to make conversation, but there was a language barrier.

It was dark outside with high cloud cover. However, visibility to the cloud cover was very good. At the top right hand side of my front window I noticed a green, nearly perfectly sphere shaped object cross to my left going downward. It moved faster than an airplane would, in close to a straight line at around a 30 degree angle with respect to the ground. The sighting lasted between 3-5 seconds and then it was behind trees some 100 ft. in the distance. The rate and angle of descent was unlike any aircraft I have ever seen. There is no airport in the direction of the sighting. It is unclear how far away the object was or what its actual size was since I had no point of reference. The object was between the size of a green pea and a chick pea held at arms length. It was uniformly a lum! inous green in color, not bright or directional, as an aircraft light might be. The center area of the object appeared to have a slightly less greenish color, but the object did appear otherwise to be perfectly spherical. In general, the object appeared to be traveling from north to south, but exact directions were impossible to determine. There was no sound (windows rolled up) and no hint of any crash. Nothing was reported on local news about this incident or any type of airplane crash. I was returning from shopping and had nothing to drink that would impair my judgement. I observe commercial jetliners overflying this road at night on a regular basis heading towards Manchester, NH airport. Manchester airport is situated to the east behind my direction of travel. This object was unlike anything I have observed in many decades of watching the night sky. The object was definitely not a meteor. A meteor often has a streaky appearance, sometimes a tail and in my experience they! are never uniform spheres with defined edges. This object was! clearly in the unidentified category based upon my experience. It is the only object I&#39;ve ever observed that I could not readily explain.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Just the back lights. 2 triangle shapes at either end with numerous white lights around the triangle, showing their shape and 2 lights inbetween the triangles flashing a red light between the two.<n> <n><n> <n><n> But what really made me wonder about it was, it was flying just along the treetops, very low to the ground, moving slow and it made no sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The object was silent, emitted an aura around it, and the center appeared to pulsate. The center also appeared to made more of plasma rather than metal which you would expect to see if it were a man-made aircraft. He said it was traveling extremely fast and was about 10-15 feet above the tree line (60-70 foot pine trees). It was in his line of sight for about 4-5 seconds and then disappeared behind the tree line. He said it looked like a dinner plate standing on end, not the typical disc shape you would think of with ufo&#39;s. He also noted that the light was emitting from the object, it didn&#39;t have actual lights on it like you would see on an airplane.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It took off so fast and we were left confused as to what the hell what we had just saw. It seemed to leave a quick trail of light as it blasted off.

In a straight line the lights moved from horizontal to vertical.  Top red middle white bottom red. Lights were much higher in the sky than radio/cell phone towers.  These lights seem to be too stationary to be an Air Plane.  There was also another stationary white light, possibly a helicopter. Closer to the ground, but far away from the other lights.  The singular white light moved under the three other lights, still much closer to the grown.  Once the white light lined up under the three lights, they turn into one  non blinking red light, and quickly goes into the distance.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

I only saw it for a sec and a half.  I’ve been in the aviation business, working with aircraft and I have never seen anything travel that fast.  It looked like it was traveling from the north shore to the south shore of Long Island.

12/11/09 02:50|Carlsbad|CA|Light|2 Minutes|This UFO displayed a bright blue light when flying to the left and a bright red light when flying to the right, moved fast and circled.|12/12/09|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/073/S73653.html|195|ndxe200912| This UFO displayed a bright blue light when flying to the left and a bright red light when flying to the right, moved fast and circled.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At approximately 2:50am, while looking Southwest from a business just South of Palomar Airport in Carlsbad, California, a bright blue light in the sky caught my attention while I had been outside walking in a parking lot. The light was at the horizon and seemed far away, like it might be near Interstate 5 or the coastline. However, the light was brighter than it should have been if it was a regular aircraft flying from that far away. It was also quiet, so I assumed it was too far away for me to hear.  The blue light was flying to the left.  That&#39;s what really made me stop to look at it. I thought something was strange about what I was looking at. I work by an airport so I&#39;m used to seeing lights in the sky all the time, but something seemed strange about this one. If an aircraft is flying from the right to my left in front of me, shouldn&#39;t I be seeing a red navigation light? The light slowed and changed colors.  It went from blue to red and flew back to my right.  It appeared to be circling something off in the distance, like a police helicopter. My initial thought was that it WAS a police helicopter, but I was still confused by the lights and the direction of travel. I have this saying to remember which side of an aircraft the lights are on: &#34;Go right ahead.&#34; I think of green meaning &#39;go&#39; and &#39;right&#39; reminds me that green should be on the right side of the plane. As I stood there and watched, I expected to see a white search light come on. It never did. It circled a few times, even seemed to hover. It would moved off quickly again, dipped, and sometimes dipped so low that I couldn&#39;t see it anymore because it dropped below the horizon. It seemed to always be on the move and wouldn&#39;t sit still for long. I was looking over the top of a nearby warehouse, but at such an angle that I was almost level with the roof of the building so I could see the shape of A/C units silhouetted against at the night sky. I kept walking when I lost site! of it and tried to walk to a better vantage point nearby wher! e the bu ildings were not in the way and so that I might have been able to see more sky, but the light never reappeared. I stood watching it for at least a solid minute, maybe two, long enough to see it move back and forth a few times, and for me to think about what I was seeing. Stranger still, even if the navigation lights were somehow switched, I am certain the light was BLUE and not green when flying to the left. I walked by a traffic light soon there after and compared that color to a blue business sign off the side of the road. The light was definitely blue and not green. Thinking back on it, at the moment that it turned, I do believe that I saw a white center light and possibly two very small and dim red/green navigation lights very close together, which seemed right for the distance I thought I was seeing the aircraft at, however once its side faced me, it turned a very bright red flying to the the right, and a very bright blue flying to the left. There were no other aircraft! coming or going from Palomar Airport at the time. Things were pretty quiet with hardly any cars on the road. There were no sirens I could hear, no police cars or ambulances were flying down the road heading towards it. The weather was partially cloudy with a low ceiling. The aircraft was definitely below the clouds. If I had to guess what it was, I would still go with something like a police helicopter, but I&#39;ve never seen them use a light set up light this. It behaved like a helicopter with its movements, circled, dipped, hovered, and moved off very fast, but everything just felt odd. I thought the lights were brighter and different. Back home, I even have a medical helipad nearby in which medical helicopters often land at in the middle of the night. Even close by, the medical helicopter lights were pale by comparison and they would often turn on a search light when landing. I checked my watch when I finally lost sight of the UFO and the time was 2:52am. I didn&#39;t suffer a! ny missing time, didn&#39;t feel any different, other than a bit c! onfused by what I saw now. I&#39;m ex-military and a trained observer. I wish the lights were closer so I could provide more detail. I believe what I was witnessing was maybe 2 to 3 miles away. My best guess would be somewhere along I-5 or the coast between Palomar Airport Road and Poinsettia Lane, closer to Poinsettia.<n>

The first sighting was over the Dan Rivr Mills complex. This is the second sighting of these simular shaped objects.My son and i sometimes ride out of Danville about 20 miles to the dryfork area near chatham va. We have family there who has one of the largest areas of untouched forested land, the largest wooded area on the map. We were in that location in a secluded area in a second cleared field for farming tobbacco and wheat.We some times go there at night to look up at the stars and have father son talks and to just enjoy the silence and sounds of nature.While we were sitting there in my pickup truck i saw another oval shaped object appear in the sky above the tree top area in the sky, this object immediately streaked accross the sky in a straight line and vanished.My son was not looking in the direction i was at that moment and he missed seeing this object,i immediately told him about it and i had t! old him about the object i saw over Dan River Mills the week before.About 2 minutes later another object of the same shape,color,and appearence suddenly appeared in the exact same location as the first one. This time my son and i both were looking right at this object, and this object also took off with enormous speed and streaked accross the night sky. My son had never seen anything like this before and became very frightened to the point of panic and he wanted to leave the area.I calmed him down by talking to him and proceeded to stay there about another 30 minutes and then we left.These objects were the same shape,color,and size as the one i saw over the mill.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date is approximate.

I looked up to see an object overhead 3/4 of the way up from the horizon. The object was moving very slow almost hovering coming from a southerly direction.  The object continued to move from the south to the north very slow.  The object appeared to be disk shaped with several yellowish white lights and a red non-blinking light toward the middle of the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object continued to move from south to the north were it made a turn and moved toward the center of town. This object made no sound and appeared to be the size of a house. The object appeared to be 150&#39;-500&#39; from the ground.  I ran into the house and yelled for my wife to come outside and look at this thing flying in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Upon going outside my wife saw the object and told me to run and grab the camera.  I got my camera and tried to get some photos of the object but wasn&#39;t able to get a good shot.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I called the local police department to ask if anyone else reported seeing anything strange flying around the night sky.  The dispatcher told me that nothing was reported but would advise any officers in the area to keep a look out.  I then went back outside and continued to look in the sky to see if I would possibly see it again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My neighbor who is a police officer then drove up and I walked over to tell him what I saw when all of a sudden it appeared again. The object came from the same direction as before almost like it was circling back around.  My neighbor told me the only thing he could think it might be was a military drone.  I asked him why a drone over Spring Hill?   He said he didn&#39;t know but looked a little to big to be a drone and was flying too slow.  The object moved off to the west and appeared to turn up on it&#39;s side so that you could see the top.  After the object moved out of sight I again asked my neighbor what he thought it could be and he shook his head and said I don&#39;t know.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Whatever this object was, i! t was large, very slow moving and didn&#39;t make any noise.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke via telephone with this witness, and he sounded both sincere, and sober-minded, to us.<n>

They were very tiny to the eye. Almost the size of a very distant star.  At first it looked like formation of Canadian geese because it was traveling in a V formation.  But then very quickly and erratically changed their orientation.  They were then like a loose rope, or like a whip, still all in a line but following each other like a snake.  They traveled a great distance in only about 10 seconds.  1st almost over head and then out of sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It all happened very quickly but would estimate there were about 25 to 30 of them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I know that this was not something natural or man made.<n>

I’ve been skeptical  in existence of another life form but now that I have witnessed first hand something out of the ordinary I believe that they may be things out there that we still don’t know very much about.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was driving home from work and in front of me I noticed a series of 3 evenly spaced orange glowing lights, and one single glowing light that wasn&#39;t as closely spaced. I drive that street everyday and know it couldn’t have been just stars, street lights, or airplanes, then the lights went away one at a time, starting from the right then going left, last light to go out was single light farthest away from the others(it was on the left of all of them).  It happened about 1 second in between each other. They were all in a straight horizontal line. I kept driving and stopped at a light and t! here it was in front of me this time, just 3 lights this time, but I could see the out line of a disk shape on the bottom of the lights and once again the lights disappeared again going right to left one at a time.<n>

The objects moved in a way that is very different than anything I have ever seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was driving home and saw three bright orange/yellow lights in a row.  They split and then disappeared.  When I arrived at home I saw a triangular shape of lights in the sky to the east(flashing green, red and white) and called my family and next door neighbors out to see it..  We then saw multiple flashing lights to the east and north.  the lights would appear in a triangular shape, flashing and then disappear, only to reappear in a few minutes.  The lights moved in a way that is very different than any aircraft I have ever seen.   There were a few times that many lights began to flash at once then they stopped, only to start again in a few minutes.  My husband tried to video tape the incident but the lights were too far away to capture.  This went on for quite some time.  Did any anyone else in our area or close see this?  I have never experienced anything like this in my life..  My husband and I have 5 children.  My husband is a financial analyst and has a degree in Information Systems Management from CU, and I am a Cosmetologist/College student.  One of my neghbors has a degree in both Horticulture and Communication, and the other has experience as a family advocate, and has vorked for United Way as a volunteer.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
12/10/09 17:50|Woodbridge|VA|Other|5 seconds|I saw a v shaped ,silent object moving very quicky in the night sky.|12/12/09|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/073/S73638.html|204|ndxe200912| I saw a v shaped ,silent object moving very quicky in the night sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was taking my dog, Sparky, out for a walk at approx. 17:50 hrs on 12/10/09 in the back common area of my townhouse complex.  It was dark at that time, and as I was passing through the opening of two end units, I heard a power hand saw being used by a resident on his rear deck of the townhouses backing up to the drainage ditch which I was approaching from the opposite side.  The sound stopped and I saw him walk back inside his house as I reached the spot where I let my dog loose to run and fetch the ball (I know its dark, but I throw it to a spot across the ditch, just like I have done hundreds of times before).<n> <n><n> <n><n> After I threw the ball, I have about 40 seconds before she returns with it, I looked up in the sky just to see the stars on this clear and crisp evening.  Panning the sky to the north, I saw what at first looked like a tighter that usual grouping of faint stars, a shallow V of an angle approx. 135 degrees to the backside of the V.  The V shape wasn’t a group of stars, because it was moving from the north to the south.  There were 5-6 dimmer than a star lights on each arm of the V and a gap of no lights to the front of the V.  The dark frontal gap was approx one-seventh the size of the V.  I spotted it approx 30 degrees from vertical where I was standing and tracked it moving south for only 5-6 seconds before it went dim.  It went dim before it was obscured by the height of the roofs of the townhouses across the ditch. Total view angle was approx 90-100 degrees.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The height was hard to determine as I had seen nothing like it before to compare the size, although planes come from various directions regularly coming of going to Dulles or Reagan airport.  The speed seemed very fast even if it was low, but in the relative quiet moment of the evening as it was, I heard not a whisper of sound before, during or after the craft passed overhead.  It may have been higher than I thought but the speed would have been even faster to move across that span of sky.<n>

The light appeared to be a shade of orange.  It seemed to be getting closer and closer until it looked like it was directly above my neighbor&#39;s house.  My window was open and I did not hear a sound come from the craft.  If it was a conventional craft it would have made some kind of an audible noise that could be heard over the strong wind that was blowing.  I observed it for approximately 15 seconds before going to get a video recorder, but when I returned to the window the craft was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Two seperate craft.|12/12/09|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/073/S73629.html|208|ndxe200912| Hovering ligths over Buckeye.  Viewed from Miller and Baseline road. Two seperate craft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On December 9th 2009 at approximately 21:00 hours, I was driving southbound on Miller road approaching Southern avenue.  I noticed two bright lights to the south that appeared to be about one mile away near the old mill.  As I approached my turn at Maricopa I was still watching the lights as they were out of the ordinary.  They appeared to slowly be moving to the west as I was traveling west down Maricopa road. This is when I became alarmed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I made the turn onto sunset point south bound, I kept fixated on the two lights hovering in the sky.  They appeared to stop moving. I raced to baseline road as quickly as possible.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I got there I parked on the south side of baseline looking south.  The object was approximately 300 yards away hovering about 100ft in the air.  I could barely make out a dark silhouette between the lights.  They appeared to slowly begin moving south when the light on the right side of the object flickered out slowly.  The other light remained, but appeared to be dimming.  It took approximately 30 seconds to one minute before the left side or remaining light dimmed then flickered out as well.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I regained my composure and began to try to rationalize the sighting.  Maybe it was something I just hadn’t noticed before.  Anyway my Wendy’s was getting cold, so I began to leave.   I looked back up, and the lights were back, but twice as far away as and farther east than before.  I realized I had my digital camera with me, I took video for 1min 45 seconds at this point.  The lights hovered and slowly started to move south.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Throughout this entire time the object never lost altitude, and wasn’t moving fast enough to achieve this by conventional means like everyday aircraft. No noise either, just silence.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Video was stopped due to poor camera quality. I continued to watch for approximately a minute longer absolutely fixated. I looked away to prep the camera for more video. When I looked up there was another set of two lights. Closer together and not parallel to each other like the first lights. I took video again for 1min 45 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The first set were still there, but began to flicker out just like the first time. First the right one went out quite quickly. Then the left remained illuminated, but appeared to be dimming. The newer set of lights maintained its tight formation with the first object as the remaining light from it disappeared. They then began to slowly move south until I could no longer see them. Entire elapsed time was approximately 20 minutes.<n>

It starts off as a very intense bright star around 7pm and thoughout the evening moves very very slowly. It starts off in the east and fades over the pacific before it blinks out. I began to realize this isn&#39;t a star when I was walking my dog one evening, it was a cloudless summer night in August, it was beautiful to look at the stars and take my dog for a walk. As i began to walk, I looked up at the bright &#34;star&#34; and it just turned off. I thought that was kind of weird. So when i got home, I sat in my backyard with my mother and told her, as to her dismay she didn&#39;t believe me so i wanted to prove it. We watched the star and in 17 minutes time, the star began to move. When it moved, it was wobbly. And right before it moves it shoots off a red light into the air. This happens every night, we are pretty sure this is a traini! ng mission or something of the sort for this UFO that eventually keeps moving very slowly and blinks out over the pacific ocean every night. If you live in newport beach, california look out in the sky around this time for a bright star, it might take roughly 30 minutes for it to move, but you will see this.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Sighting of Jupiter, perhaps.

I was about 100ft away and looking from a forward and underneath position.  The craft was longer than it was wide - rounded on top and a V shape underneath.  The V shape went up then spread out to wings that appeared to go the length of the craft.  A car came behind me and I had to move because there was no shoulder on the road.

Walking home I take the usual route Hillsdale Highway then SW Scholl’s Ferry Rd. then home a few more turns afterward.  But that walk home, I stumbled to an extraordinary amazement in the night sky.  Sometime between 2 AM and 3 AM in the morning I was standing on the side walk next to Raleigh’s Elementary school staring at an awesome site above me.  In the sky above me I saw a fleet of UfOs coming from the moon into our airspace miles above me it was extraordinary.  These lights were all in a coroneted formation heading north.  Aircrafts looked bright and cylinder in shape and there were perhaps 1000 that I was seeing.  They all looked as if they were going fast maybe 65 mph or 70. They all disappeared behind.  The artificial clouds that were scattered far apart in the sky. It happened on December 7th 2009th.  Event Lasted less than 25 minutes.<n>

Lights were arranged, from my point of view, from left to right, white - red - white - red. They traveled following the ships channel, from south to north. It took about fifteen (15) seconds for them to travel from the southern horizon to the northern horizion. Without an acurate reference as to their size, I would have to guess their altitude to be anywhere from 500 to 2,000 feet.<n>

There was no engine noise like from a plane and the object appeared stationary for about 1 minute. Then I noticed 4 dim red/orange lights in a backwards 7 type formation with the white planet out in front of the tip of the backwards seven. The red/orange lights slowly flashed or pulsated several times while remaining in formation. They were located slightly below and to the right of the planet. I quickly snapped a photo with a camera phone and continued to watch. Then noticed the white &#34;planet&#34;drift slowly down and to the left side of Orions belt. About 45 sec from top star in belt to middle star. Tried to get another photo to show the change in position in relation to Orions belt. Red/ orange lights were no longer visible so I ran to turn off the lights nearby to try to get a better look and take another photo. The &#34;plane! t&#34; then moved quicker and further down and to the left. In about 20 seconds it went from the middle star to below and to the left of the bottom star in the belt. Then it appeard to flash red/orange and disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides little contact information.  PD))<n>

The location was over the ocean, some distance offshore of what would be considered as the Diamondhead or Waikiki/Honolulu area of Oahu. The green light flashed once, then streaked several miles to the left in a split second, flashed brightly once more, then went dark momentarily and flashed dimly once more before disappearing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I watched the area for 5 more minutes but didn&#39;t see another occurrence.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Commercial aircraft are always passing through the same airspace as this sighting, and as I watched the area after this sighting there were a number of commercial flights moving slowly across the sky with their characteristic small flashing white lights. The speed, color and movement pattern of man-made craft and UFOs are entirely different and as a former flight student, I would never possibly confuse the two.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have seen the same thing before, from the other side of the island of Oahu, over Kaneohe Bay about 10 years ago. On that occasion there were two of us watching, and we saw the same thing and still talk about it. The green light and flight pattern for that older sighting were much the same as this sighting on 12/06/09, further validating these experiences for me. I checked the local news the next day and found no reports of sightings, but I find it hard to believe that I was the only witness.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Opposite to the office are two apartment buildings and a large car park.  A bright light in the sky caught my attention. As we walked across the street I began to doubt it was an aircraft of Christmas decoration so I stopped to watch this light.  The light moved slowly in the sky and passed behind the two apartment buildings and over some workshops bordering the car park.  The light was elliptical, orange and smaller than most conventional single-propeller driven aircraft and appeared to be slightly blurred. I doubt the light was above 400m in altitude.  Neither I or my colleague are able to explain this.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.  PD))<n>

I imediately thought it was a meteor, but then it slowed down, directly south of me; it slowed to a crawl. It appeared the size of a bright star or planet in the night sky. After a few seconds it sped up and flew off to the West. When it came in it was decending, when it flew off it was either level or slightly ascending.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This event lasted aproximately 3-5 seconds, at about 6:57 pm.

I don&#39;t beleive in UFOs, but this was really weird and I think it was something of the sort. My brother who is ten saw it too. My dad saw it but fails to admit it. It looked like a black plane. 2 hours later, after church, we were coming back and it was in the EXACT same position. It was definatly shaped like a plane, like a commercial airliner, but it&#39;s impossible for those to hover. Later that night there were lights where it had been, but then they vanished. While I was trying to take a picture of the aircraft, my phone wouldn&#39;t turn on until we started moving again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

My first thought was that I was seeing lights on top of a tower in the distance because the two lights were blinking one then the other at a slow pace and were brighter than I have ever viewed on an aircraft. As I got closer, within one quarter of mile I realized that there was nothing underneath the lights. The lights were intensely bright still slowly flashing in the same pattern. I eventually drove directly under the lights and was unable to make out the shape of the object in the darkness but did notice smaller flashing lights underneath the two bright lights. The lights under the object were flashing much faster and appeared to be different colors, red, green and white. The lights all appeared to be stationary.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The second object or lights were approximately one quarter of a mile farther as I continued northbound on interstate 167.  Just as the first object or lights initially appeared as two very large bright lights side by side so did the second with exception that the two lights were not blinking at any time and were bright green.  The green lights appeared to be stationary over the interstate at the same altitude as the first.  As I continued northbound I eventually drove under it and again noticed smaller quickly flashing colored light beneath this one and was unable again to discern the actual shape of the abject.  As I was about to drive under it my car was approached by two other cars that came from behind me and both sped past as if they had not even seen the very large low flying intensely bright green lights which I found very odd as the lights were so brilliant I found it hard to look away and had slowed my rate of speed to continue watching them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After passing the second object or lights I decided to take the next exit which was the first exit in Tukwila in an attempt to take a front road that I noticed back to view the lights approximately a minute or so later and realized that I could no longer see either of them anymore. There were simply no lights of any kind to be seen at this point.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  The person who submitted this report is well known to NUFORC, and we know her to be a highly reliable source of accurate information.

At approximately 2100 hours on the night of December 5th 2009, I went out on my back porch to smoke a cigarette. It was a clear night, the moon was low over the horizon and it was approximately 25 degrees. After about a minute, I looked across my backyard to the sky above a single story duplex that is almost directly across from my back porch. When I looked up I saw a dark rectangular shaped mass, but it had a slight point to the front center.  Along the underside there were two perfectly aligned rows of 5 or 6 star-like lights. They traveled in perfect formation so I know that they were a part of the larger object. There was no noise, and because of the temperature and the hour I do not think it was a glider/parachute, etc.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I watched this object for approximately one minute and thirty seconds. At first it glided closer to me in a very tight S pattern, making very sharp 90 degree turns. It was traveling South Southwest at a moderate speed, at one point it stopped completely and hovered above another duplex for a few seconds. I could tell because the lights were still and it looked to have one end lower down than the other, and that’s when I saw the rows of dim lights. After it hovered a few seconds it rose straight up in the sky, I could still see the light formations on the bottom. It slowly started traveling southwest again, and then it disappeared completely. It moved like nothing I have ever seen. The sharp angles of its turns and the speed at which it rose straight up into the sky were completely foreign, not to mention how it disappeared right in front of me. Shortly after, maybe 5 minutes later, I saw a plane traveling in the opposite direction that the object was traveling. The plane had! flashing blue, red, and white lights and left a trail.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It seems very clear they are orbs, not plans, their movement is nothing like plans and they disappear all at once.  At first I thought they were speeding up the film time and they were plans landing, but why did they all disappear at one time.  The pattern they were flying did not seem like plans at all.

I asked him what he was doing and what was going on. He walked quickly over to me and proceeded to tell me what he saw. He was crying and shaking and very scared. He said he saw a dark figure with really big, dark eyes, with an orange glow all around it. He said it looked like it was floating just a little off of the ground, came from behind my car and went next to the house and turned and looked at him. He said it then floated higher, and was about the height of the Christmas lights hanging on the porch. He said it looked at him. He slightly turned his head and closed his eyes briefly because he was scared. When he looked back it was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> He said whatever he saw was about as tall as he is (about 4 feet). He said he couldn’t see its legs and its arms appeared to be straight down beside its body. He said its face was very dark and its eyes were really big and a slightly different color than the face. He said it glowed all around it. I estimate he was 40 to 50 feet from the entity, given where he was and where he said he saw it. I was during the daytime, at approximately 4:00 p.m. I saw the flickering orange glow for about 3 seconds and my son saw it for about 10 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We live in a wooded area, have dogs in the back, and they did not bark at all. However, when I called my husband out to tell him what happened and to look for it, my small house dog came out and immediately started smelling the ground where my son said the entity had been floating.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am of sound mind, I have never seen or heard of anything like this before, and I am very curious and somewhat confused about what happened.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke via telephone with this witness, and she seemed sincere, and sober-minded, in our opinion.

I pulled over to get a better look and realized that there was more like 9-12 of them.  The lowest was at about 700 ft and the highest I would say was about 2500 ft.  At one point the craft had stopped and then they started to move again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When they reached the highest elevation (2500 ft) they disappeared one by one til they were all gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I believe I saw these in the eastern sky.  When I saw them I knew right away, that these lights were special.   I never saw anything like it and there was no sound what so ever.  When you looked at the lights they appeared to have 3 or four colors. It was absolutely awesome to see.<n>

It looked almost like a V shape with red and green lights with a white glow between each light. The lights on the craft were a vertical rectangle shape.  It whizzed above us in a straight line until we no longer saw it. But after that we saw these tiny lights, they almost looked like stars, but there were some of all different colours, blue, yellow, red, orange. They were silent, non-flashing and moving at top speed. They were very small but they were quite low down.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This continued for 5-7 minutes, we could not see where they were coming from. Although we could see the general direction which they came, they seemed to just appear.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The last light we saw, however, was quite different from the others. It was bright red, almost glowing. But it didn’t move smoothly though the sky like the others, it was almost like a pulsating action that propelled it through the sky rather erratically, although it was moving in the same directions as all the others, it was not moving in a line, rather, hopping from left to right.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was probably the most sceptical person about this sort of thing before last night. But I do like to keep an open mind to other possibilities. At the time I was convinced we were witnessing something quite unusual.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What convinces me that it was more than reflection of light or meteorites, is the very first thing we saw that looked too much like a spacecraft, but not enough that I am convinced it was deffinately not a plane.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Afterwards we noticed at Brisbane airport (I live on a hill and can see planes taking off and landing) that the airplanes were circling the airport instead of landing like they normally do. After 5 minutes they all landed one by one.<n>

It was not a star because it was so close to the ground.  I question if it is a helicopter because I&#39;ve never seen one hover in the sky like that and I heard no noise.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Please keep my name confidential.<n>

Lights would turn on and brighten to high intensity.  While this was happening, could see something being projected from the light source.  It would fade to black.  Could see the shape dimly in the sky.  Then would re-illuminate itself in a different position in the sky.  Following the same pattern of lights and projections.  Illuminations would last 3-5 seconds in each location.  There was NO sound at all.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After the 3 time, heard a jet in the sky. The object kept moving overhead, over the town.  Did this 4 times and then was out of range.  The color of the lights were a bright gold.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As soon as we heard the jet, the object took off quickly.  That is when we saw the last glowing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Observers:  2 adults (special education teacher and a life coach for disabled adults) and 3 children (ages 16, 13, and 8)<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We have corrected the date above.

12/4/09 18:00|Buffalo|NY|Light|20 mins|Red/green lights seen over Buffalo New York from Fort Erie, Canada.|12/12/09|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/073/S73591.html|245|ndxe200912| Red/green lights seen over Buffalo New York from Fort Erie, Canada.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was driving home from work in Fort Erie,Ontario, Canada, which is on the border of Buffalo, New York.  I stopped at a red light and noticed above the tree&#39;s 2 pinkish red blinking lights.  I noticed this because of the colour and the fact that the lights were on top of each other, not beside each other like an airplane.  I watched for a few seconds when the lights suddenly changed to a bright green colour, then immediately afterwards, they changed direction on a dime and started going in the other direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I thought this was wierd so I decided to follow them.  I drove down to a rest area beside the water about a kilometer away, and could see that the lights were directly over Buffalo, New York.  The lights floated around, changing directions quickly, going left, right, up and down and backwards and forwards.  Then the lights started going up and to the left, slowly slowing down until they came to a stop.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At this time they changed colours again back to the pinkish red colour.<n> <n><n> <n><n> All of a sudden directly below the lights another set of lights appeared out of nowhere.  These lights were an orangish yellow.  It slowly went up towards the first set of lights and then passed it.  The red lights then started moving again, following the orange lights.  Then as quickly as the orange lights appeared, they disappeared.  Then the red lights started moving closer to the water, then turned left and went deeper into Buffalo, getting smaller.  I watched this for about 2 minutes and then left.<n>
12/4/09 17:50|McMurray|PA|Cylinder|1 hr 40 min|Vertical pinkish light shaft pulsing brighter and duller in night sky for almost 2 hours|12/12/09|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/073/S73583.html|246|ndxe200912| Vertical pinkish light shaft pulsing brighter and duller in night sky for almost 2 hours<n> <n><n> <n><n> U(F)O sighting Friday Dec. 4, 2009  At 17:50 while walking my dog in our neighborhood in McMurray, PA I noticed a stream or stick of light very high in the sky.  It seemed to be thin and cylindrical (perhaps cigar, but did not appear to taper at the ends) and was positioned vertically and slightly tilted at the top so that the whole was at an angle.   It was very diffuse light (cloud cover?) that seemed peach or pale pink.  When studied I noted that areas of the ‘stick’ had pulsing or throbbing light coming from it, again very diffuse so could not be identified as a particular light source.  The shaft was alone in the sky without any other light shaft attached (to the ground or elsewhere).<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was in the southeast region of the area and quite high.  A small plane flew overhead while I was looking at the ‘stick’ and it was well below the ‘stick’.  The object did not move and remained in position.  If divided into quarters, the top second quarter was usually hard to see as if blocked by cloud.  The light got brighter and duller.  I stopped at a neighbor’s house and she and her husband came out and also looked at it and commented on the size, shape, and areas of brighter and duller light.  The object was very long and certainly if side by side with the moon would have been at least as tall as the moon.  Because it was such a narrow shaft of light it seemed about as thick as a plane jet stream that you can see during the day although perhaps even slimmer than that.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I checked the sky at about 19:00 hours it was still present, but I could not get a photo with my digital camera.  At 19:40 a different neighbor called from her cell phone to chat while walking her dog.  I asked her to look in the sky and tell me if she saw the light object.  She described a long shaft of light “kind of pink” that’s going “on and off”.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I went outside to try again to take a photo at 20:10, it was no longer present.<n>

We pulled the car over and looked above our heads and saw the following:  A large circular red light in the center of the bottom of the black, triangular shaped object.   There were three other red lights on the bottom tips of each angle of the triangle.  There were also three pulsating yellow lights that were going clockwise at a medium pace.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The UFO appeared to hover quietly then move straight up and down without sound.  We heard a low rumbling sound emit from the object while it moved very quickly in a diagonal manner, then shifted direction suddenly in different directions.  The UFO then began hovering silently again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About 30 minutes later we heard and saw a low flying fighter jet flying just above the tree line, going towards the UFO sighting area.<n>

When to my surprise my roommate points above the tree tops in the sky behind my house. To my astonishment I look up and see 6 lights moving in a row from left to right. So I yell to my boyfriend to come out side, that my roommate and I thought we might have seen a UFO. He grabs the video camera but it appears dead. But he makes it to see the lights go from right to left disappear for a moment and then down up and disappear. Then my roommate steps back in the house, leave my boyfriend and I out side. About 2 minutes later we hear a cat screaming in the woods. That is when I ran back inside.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It must have also killed our video camera cause it was charging all day and when my boyfriend tried to use it to capture the phenomenon it was dead.<n> <n><n> <n><n> And our TV antenna was frozen for a couple minutes.<n>

I had been up for about 30 minutes or so when an unidentified flying object flew passed my front bay window fairly quickly (about 50 yards away).  It was triangle shape with several lights (red &amp; white).  I would have dismissed it as an airplane or some other reasonable explanation BUT it was flying way to low over the roof tops of the homes across the street and there was no engine noise or any other noise at all which prompted me to report this.  I looked out window it was already gone, but, I could see a light over a roof top that was moving along from roof top to roof top moving in the same direction as the aircraft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

Trailing it was a convential aircraft of some kind, because I could see the strobe lights at the base, tail of the aircraft. As I drove down the road the craft passed diagnol to my position about three or four miles from my position, followed by the other aircraft in pursuit. All of a sudden the light took off and left the second aircraft far behind and it did not slow down till I lost sight of it. As I finally pulled into my parking lot at the condo, I identified the craft that had been following the circular light. My father and I have been attending airshows since I was five and I can identify every convential, man made aircraft in the world. So as I was walking in overhead flew a Black Hawk helicopter, I assume is stationed with the medivac unti based out of Bangor Maine. They are a constant presence in the air here! in the kennebec county airspace and ther engine sound and cavatation noise of there rotors are unmistakable. I know aircraft, and I know what a planet or a star, or meteorite looks lik and this was not any of those. There was a planet shinning brightly in the sky tonight but this object was no where near that planet.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I looked out the window and I saw a yellow/orange light glide across the field.  I watched as it moved all the way to the edge of the window.  When I leaned over to see if the object was still moving in the same direction, I saw it jump into the sky and fade away.  When the object flew away, I heard some noises on the roof.  Even though it was winter, I do not think that snow on the rooftop would make such loud noises. The next day, I woke up and decided to look around the house and sure enough all of the snow on the roof was gone.  The roof seemed to also be burned.  I decided to check out the area where the object has been flying and I was told by two men in snow camouflage that I was not able to go to that area for a few days.  These men were also holding something but they were not rifles or guns, but some kind of instrument.  I later saw a Boeing Chinook helicopter fly over the area in what loo! ked like a designated path.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

The sky was not completely dark yet, so I was able to see this object clearly.  Over on the left side of the highway, there was a 4-sided star shaped object hovering from the ground, and all four wings had round bright white lights on it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object was not moving and it was not attached to anything.  It was hovering quite low, maybe only 100 feet.  It was absolutely silent and was not causing wind turbulence or anything.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was the most strangest thing I ever seen.<n>

After being asked by others to describe that smell, I could at best state that it smelled like a steamy-metallic odor, almost like iron mixed with steam. It was not a chemical smell (i.e. our hot tub chemicals can be odorous), nor was it a burning smell made by charcoal, wood or other fire-causing source. Although I have smelled a car radiator over heat, this was not comparable.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Additional Activity  Immediately following the incident as described in my initial report, the following activity took place. Please note that at no time before/during or after this unusual situation, did we lose power.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Cellular Telephone: My cellular telephone began to sporadically malfunction. I had to contact my mobile service provider and had technical support try to trouble-shoot the device and problems, which consisted of:  Frequent inability to make calls ‘Call Failed’ just seconds after making a call (when I could) The phone turning itself off A loud, electrical interference while conducting what little calls I could place  The battery was fully charged and prior to the incident and I had not experience a problem with the phone. Technical support stated that it did not appear to be the SIM card, but seemed more like a device malfunction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Other members of the household whom were not at home at the time of the initial incident, did not experience any problem with their mobile telephones. Our service provider had me place calls from both my device, as well as from another family member’s (we are on the same network). My device was problematic but theirs was not. The technician noted the odd electrical nterference and stated that my only other choice was to get a replacement device if the problems persisted. I agreed to wait a day or two and see what would happen. After two days of problems post-incident, my cellular phone problems were gone and I did not have to replace the device.<n> <n><n> <n><n> HD-DVR Cable Box: Our HD-DVR cable box ceased working and kept giving us an &#34;Unrecoverable Write Error&#34; message that technical support stated indicates the drive has been damaged. Due to our cable provider’s inability to fix the box, we had to exchange it for a one.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Behavior of the cats: Two out of three of our cats exhibited non-typical behavior. All three remained somewhat skittish for the remainder of the day immediately following the incident, however, at approximately 22:20 on the evening of the incident and after retiring to bed for the evening, my son woke me concerned for one of the cats.<n> <n><n> <n><n> She was hissing, crying and pacing on the ledge of the window in the rear bedroom. She was upset to the point that she crawled up the screen and had to be pried off, only to remain very bothered for an additional 20 minutes or so. Upon inspection of the yard(s), we did not see anything, however, are surrounded by dense woods.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At approximately 03:45 that same night (date was now December 4th, 2009), I was woken when a different cat was literally running and jumping into the sliding glass door window as well as jumping onto the drapes that covered the windows. He was howling and crying as though something was on the lanai, next to our hot tub. Worried that he would hurt himself by running into the glass, I tried to pick him up but he was so upset that he scratched my hand and arms and jumped away. After approximately 5 minutes of this behavior, he retreated to hiding underneath a loveseat where he continued to cry for several minutes. Further inspection of the lanai and yard(s) revealed nothing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Note: The side and backyards are open, but the woods extend from the fences, outward. We have had raccoons, armadillo, possums and bobcats get around the fencing from time to time, but even then the cats act in a more curious fashion and will actually go to the glass doors or windows to observe, never intimidated. We are at a loss as to what could have caused this abnormal behavior. Aside from the incidents above, they have been fine.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
12/3/09 13:22|North Port|FL|Unknown|5 seconds|Something falling out of the sky, dimming my skylight, followed by a loud explosion heard throughout the neighborhood.|12/12/09|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/073/S73566.html|258|ndxe200912| Something falling out of the sky, dimming my skylight, followed by a loud explosion heard throughout the neighborhood.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am not exactly sure what took place other than I am certain that what produced the very loud explosion, came from the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Time: Approximately 1:22 PM on Thursday, December 3, 2009.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Location: North Port, Florida  I was sitting in my bathroom applying makeup, almost directly underneath the bathroom skylight. I did not have the bathroom light on and was applying the makeup with the natural lighting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Suddenly, something crossed over the skylight and dimmed the room substantially. Within approximately 2-3 seconds, there was a very loud explosion, as though something very heavy and large, hit the ground. The sound shook the house and sent all three of our cats into hiding.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Initially, when seeing the dimming only, I thought it was a bird, although it would have had to be rather large. I also considered an airplane but did not hear one single sound, such as jet engine or other noise. I then went out to see if I could find anything. The explosion so quickly after seeing the dimming, made me consider an airplane due to the severity of the noise and the fact that the house shook.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Note: Our house is surrounded by dense woods on both sides, as well as in the back.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I went onto the back lanai and checked, however, did not notice anything in the immediate backyard. I did not notice any additional or unusual sounds, nor did I notice any smoke or fire. For a very brief period of time, I did note a very odd odor, which I cannot identify. It dissipated rather quickly. It was not strong, but was something that I have not ever smelled before. I returned to the house after my initial inspection.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At approximately 1:26 I telephoned the North Port Police Department. I was transferred to Dispatcher Martin and asked if anyone had reported seeing/hearing anything. She stated that yes, other people in the neighborhood had contacted the North Port PD about the noise. She also stated to me that there were two officers en route to our general neighborhood. The call with Dispatch ended. I returned outside to look around some more.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Upon returning to the front of the house, I observed that all power lines/transformers seemed to be in tact without smoke. At that time, two NP PD officers pulled in front of my home and my neighbor’s. Three neighbors then emerged from their respective homes. One officer spoke with the neighbors across the street from me, while the other spoke with me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was asked what transpired and told the officer exactly what I witnessed. I pointed to the skylight and told him that I was almost directly underneath it when the room dimmed considerably, followed very quickly with a loud explosion. All of my neighbors and I thought that the noise came from a slightly different location, but all agreed to it being extremely close to our three houses. To my knowledge, I was the only one who “saw” anything, in addition to the explosion. The officer asked if I would be home for the day in the event that he had to come back to speak with me, of which I told him, “yes”.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The officers did not go into the woods, nor the side/back of my home. The officers remained on scene for approximately 10 more minutes and then left. I returned to my home and once again, went to look out in the back/side yards, of which did not observe anything unusual.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Note: It was approximately 2:00 PM when the cats came out of hiding.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At approximately 2:11 PM, I made another call to Dispatch Officer Martin and asked if they had found the cause of the explosion. She stated that despite dispatching “several officers” to the neighborhood, they did not find a cause and said it was strange.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Again, I did not actually &#34;see&#34; anything, but noticed a considerable dimming in the lighting as something passed overhead while in the bathroom, putting on makeup underneath the skylight.  Oddly enough, within  2-3 seconds, there was a huge explosion, that shook the house.<n>

It looked like a plane, but when my friend turned to looked, it flashed twice and sped off to the horizon. My friend thinks it&#39;s a an experimental aircraft known as an Aurora. I think that it&#39;s possible because we are only 300 miles from AREA 51.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
12/3/09 03:00|Manchester (UK/England)||Triangle|4 minutes|Mind Boggling Lights Seen In The Night Sky|2/14/10|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/073/S73682.html|260|ndxe200912| Mind Boggling Lights Seen In The Night Sky<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was last Thursday 3rd December 2009 that my UFO Sighting occurred at just after 3am in the morning, I do not want to give the exact location of where I live, except to say that this sighting occurred in Greater Manchester, UK. Altrincham, Chesire a metropolitan borough of Trafford.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I arrived home from work at 2-45 am in the morning, the first thing that I did was to put the dog out in the back garden, I then remember switching on Sky news and then I made a coffee. It was just after 3am when I was stood at the back kitchen door drinking a mug of coffee and smoking a cigarette watching my dog sniff around the garden when I spotted the strange light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The light was a very bright whitish/orangish/reddish object and appeared to be a jagged triangular shape, I have to point out that the actual colour of the light, especially around the edges was much more of a fiery orange colour, but has showed up more of a reddish colour on both the photos and video, I suspect this could be due to the fact that the camera I was using was a cheap digital phone camera? The object was almost directly above my house and it is difficult to say how high up in the sky it was, it appeared to be several hundred feet from the ground but it could have been a lot further away? I am pretty sure that what I was seeing was the bottom/stomach of the object, it was completely silent and I could not see any movement, it seemed to be completely still. Also, what else that is not seen on the photos or video is that at times the object appeared to look like it was on fire and I am pretty sure that I saw what looked like smoke or steam around the object. The li! ght appeared to the naked eye to be roughly the size of a 5 pence piece held at arms length.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I stood and observed the brightly lit object for about 45 seconds before I went inside and got my mobile phone. I took 7 still photos in total, 2 normal and 5 at full zoom (5x digital zoom). I then started to video the object on my mobile phone, what happened next was just completely mind boggling and quiet a spectacle. After filming the light for about 30 seconds, suddenly a smaller circular shaped light, greenish/white in appearance appeared from nowhere. I stood and observed the second object and watched as it blinked on and off several times, whilst also disappearing and re-appearing in different parts of the night sky as well as moving around the larger triangular object. I have to say, some of the manoeuvres and speed of the moving light was just simply stunning, mind boggling and just plain weird. After roughly 1 minute the circular light shot off in a north-westerly direction at tremendous speed and blinked out and just simply vanished. I continued to film the main o! bject for roughly a further 30 seconds before it just went out, it was like someone switched a light off, there was an orangish/reddish flash and the thing was gone, I am pretty sure that I saw an orangish streak dart away, this only lasted for no more than a second and unfortunately does not show up on the video clip.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I must have gone in and out of the garden about 15 times over the course of the next hour to see if I could see the thing again, I never saw anything else and I went to bed. I have to say, at the time and after the sighting, I never really thought that much about it, I wasn&#39;t thinking UFOS, Flying saucers, aliens or anything like that, I thought &#34; that&#39;s pretty weird&#34; and that&#39;s all I remember thinking. It was the next day and the following few days that it started to dawn on me just what I had seen. I have done some research on the Internet in the last week and I am amazed how much stuff is out there regarding UFOS, I never ever had any interest before my sighting and I didn&#39;t realise that there was so much on the web.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have shown the photos and video to several people and the main reaction that I received was &#34;wow&#34;, &#34;weird&#34;, I showed the footage to a good friend of mine, he thinks that what I witnessed was nothing more than some kind of military aircraft. I suppose that I could not rule that out as an explanation but, I have visited many air shows over the years and seen lots of stuff on the T.V and DVDS about aircraft and jets etc, and I can honestly say that I have never seen anything that can perform manoeuvres and move as fast as the objects that I witnessed. I am not saying that what I witnessed was aliens, but I would love someone to show me something man made that can perform like the objects that I witnessed, I have never seen anything remotely close.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I will have to go as time is getting on and I have a million things to do, I have decided to contact several people in the world of UFOLOGY and see what they have to say. I would be grateful if you could perhaps get an expert in analysis to have a look at my evidence and please get back to me. I am more than happy to share my evidence with people and please feel free to publish it, all I would ask is that you please withhold my name and personal details, please remember, I am a professional guy and I would not like to be subject to any kind of ridicule or unwanted attention that such a claim could bring.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I look forward very much to your reply.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thanks,  ((name deleted))<n>

My wife and I were returning home from the movies.  It was a cloudy night and while we were only about a half mile from home, when both of us saw a bright light shine above the clouds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The light on the clouds was about the size of a 747 airplane.  The &#34;light&#34; stayed on for only a few seconds then disappeared only to reappear again one or two seconds later.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Once it came back, it disappeared again after only a few seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> If this was an actual 747 plane or even a helicopter, neither one of us didn’t hear any sounds of either one.  Also, for something to make a white light circle, that large, is not man made from this Earth.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;m a retired 23 year AF member and have worked with and along side 141 and C5&#39;s while in the military, so the size of this &#34;Light&#34; can be confirmed.<n>

Around 920 on the Fort Richardson Hwy Across from Fort greely, I saw the freen lights my friends were talking about.  I stopped my truck and got out - it was just hovering - no sound nothing just there.  2 green lights and 1 white one and they were mounted on the buttom and it was triangled shape.

The light started to grow brighter after this time and almost became yellow in color. The object then slowly started to climb in the air vertically about the length that it had moved from west to east upon seeing it initially. The object then went out extremely fast and was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

This was the first time to ever witness an encounter of this significance.  There is no doubt in my mind the lights/craft I describe below are extraterrestrial.<n> <n><n> <n><n> While driving north bound on HWY 93 from Wickenburg, AZ towards Las Vegas, NV, on December 2, 2009, at approximately 8:45 p.m., an orange glow in the western sky caught my attention.  The lights seemed to be about five miles to my west and at an elevation of about 6000 to 8000 ft. AGL (above Ground Level).<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first there was only one object and with a blink of my eyes there were three more cigar shaped lights that glowed fire orange.  The lights were in a vertical step formation with the original one hovering off to the right of the other three.  Within about ten seconds they were gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About 15 min. later as I continued N. Bound on HWY 93 the lights appeared at approximately the same elevation and distance from me as before except this time they were in a horizontal formation in the NNW direction of my location and had movement to the NNE direction, they moved like skipping rocks in a pond, quite amazing to see.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The night sky was extremely clear and the moon was bright.  This was an extraordinarily clear night and there was almost no traffic on the road.<n>

I&#39;d like to know.  I was driving home - on the 210 Freeway headed East.  It was 6:30pm so it was dark.  Off to the right front I noticed far out a series of orange/yellow lights in the darkness. I thought perhaps it was a fire, on a mountain... but I realized there is no mountain in that area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At this point I just kept glancing at it, and noticed it started to become an oval of lights.  Then the thing moved... slowly to sit over the freeway.  At one point it started to move down the freeway (headed West.)  The lights I could see now.  The lights were rotating and they looked like the animated lights on a blimp.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is what I thought it might be, but it was kinda low... and the thing that was really odd, the rotating lights were on the bottom of whatever this was. Since it was dark, I could see no body to the thign, just the animated lights, that were moving in a direction.  Let me try and describe.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On the bottom of this thing, it looked like 5 lights in a row, and this row of lights, would turn off and the next row on... so forth. so it looked like a panel of five lights animating.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was no sound... and the traffic was reacting to it.  traffic slowed, etc.  I did take video off my iphone... but the iphone uses such a wide aspect that it only appears as a small set of dots... and i&#39;m shaking the phone a lot as i&#39;m driving...<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Their lights catch my attention but are usually no brighter than passing headlights on the highway. From my eastern facing position they cruise across my view from north to south.<n> <n><n> <n><n> However Last night at exactly 3:24 a.m. the sky lit up from an object streaking across the sky from west to east. It was moving at a considerable pace and was quite different than the objects I am used to seeing out this window. If you can say that the sun in the sky is about the size of a quarter were you to hold one up in the air, this object was about the size of a lentil bean in that perspective. Unlike the lights of the planes which have a cool value to their hue this object was warm and bright like an arc weld almost too bright to look at. This brightness caused a halo effect around the object which tapered off into a streaking tail which dithered behind it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I say this object was bright I mean that it lit up the sky and the buildings in first hill. It was bright enough to illuminate the facing walls of the taller buildings, the roofs as it passed over head and to silhouette the buildings as it passed to their opposite sides.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The brightness was enough to catch my attention away from my computer screen and I had just enough time to stand up in disbelief and watch it cruise past the buildings as stated heading east. The angle of entry was more level with the horizon than steep otherwise I am convinced it would have hit the tallest building in my view. Of course that is dependent on my relative position and perspective to the event, I actually do not know how high or how big this object actually was though I relate here to you my best account of what I viewed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was enough though to scare my cat out of the window and into hiding.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The event lasted 5 to 10 seconds I estimate and I did not have time to photograph the event. I make no assumptions as to what I saw.

The moon was shining through the clouds and it was bright. I noticed a whole in the clouds and I could see 4 of what I thought were stars. There were no other stars visible in any other cloud openings. It caught my attention because they were shimmering different colors. I could see a bright white, red, and green colors for sure. They weren&#39;t extremely bright, just odd looking. I watched for I guess about 2 minutes and they slowly dimmed out. Not at the exact same time, but one right after the other.

We were the last patrons to leave and the well-lit parking lot was pretty deserted.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As we were walking east, I an astronomy buff at heart decided to show my friends the constellation Orion, whose belt was directly overhead.  I was standing in the center with witness two to my left and witness three to my right.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I pointed to back Orion’s left foot (from my viewpoint), out of my left peripheral (north) I could see a triangular shaped object with a massive tailwind.  The tailwind was more than 10x the size of the object; it caught all of our attention.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I began to dialogue with my friends asking if they could see the object and they both agreed that could. We all conferred that it was approaching.  On the northeast side of the mall complex there is a parking structure.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object approached rapidly and silently over the structure.  While standing there, I asked if they seen a large black silvery (similar to Hematite) triangular object with slightly rounded corners.  They again answered yes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object silently flew over our heads covering Orion, the size of the object, the distances away above us, or how much time passed is hard to describe.  It felt close but seemed far above, I tried to size it as it was approaching with my arm extended upwards, and it was the size of my hand making the letter &#34;C&#34;.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Again, I began to describe the object to my friends as it headed south towards the mountainside of Palos Verdes, CA (not sure actual name of the mountain range) and I asked did they see a red illuminated circle underneath the bottom closer to one of the points of the triangle.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They did not see the red light; the red light was very visible to me.  As it neared the mountainside we watched it for a while longer (not sure how long) and it disappeared before getting to the mountainside.  It felt as though this was possibly t! hree minutes longs.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A few minutes later two helicopters appea! red clos e to where the object disappeared, they were substantially smaller than the object and we could hear them faintly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There is an airport east of the mall but this object vanished with us all facing south.  We talked about it for a while in the parking lot.  Jumped in our cars and went home.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> Witness 1: A 31-year-old woman from Los Angeles, CA.

12/1/09 23:00|Blanchard|MI|Light|1 hour|They look like stars, but flicker! They accelerate very fast, & brake just the same!  Move weird & come in 3's arranged in a triangle|12/12/09|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/073/S73645.html|273|ndxe200912| They look like stars, but flicker! They accelerate very fast, &amp; brake just the same!  Move weird &amp; come in 3&#39;s arranged in a triangle<n> <n><n> <n><n> The climax of my first night, and all my other sightings, was when  I was watching six of them and they all moved up at the same time in a very unique way!   I’ve seen these UFO’s 5 different nights now.  I’ve got two other witness’s , and as of now I’ve got about  1 hour of good video tape all together .    Usually when I see them its between 10:30 p.m and 1:00 am eastern time.  They usually appear in threes, and only on the very first night was there ever more than three confirmed moving in the sky in one night.   These UFO’s seem to have intelligent operator’s.  I say this because I’ve went out side twice to try to see them better on the first couple nights but when I went out they became very still, and continued to remain still for 10 mins or so after I went inside my house. To be honest and upfront,  They look and in a sense act like star’s.  That’s the main reason why I said they had intelligent operators! 	 In due time these ufo’s “glide “as I call it across the night sky.  But they don’t only glide!  They make short, very  very  fast jerky movements at times.  I’ve seen them do u turns, complete loops and double loops, sometimes they do pointless maneuvers like,  right-----à left , right---------àLeft, right------à and I’ve seen them do 45 degree turns one right after another, They flicker but usually are the same basic colors of the stars, but the same three seem to keep appearing and one of the three is always a amberish color.  But they have a flicker effect to them that  always catches my eye.  I spotted the very first one only because it was flickering.  They make, what look like very short, fast, and erratic movements, but If your not watching that one target you would never see it moving, But on the other hand, if your only watching the one SO CALLED STAR no human alive would doubt me when it moves !!! 	 I’ve seen them slowly dim out, I’ve seen them flicker what seemed to be, at one another , and then start to flicker in sync.  When they flickered at each other and in sync the did it very brightly, and instead of a flicker,  they kind of flashed. But the night they flickered at one another and in sync was my on first night.   That night I spotted one, then I  identified three, then out of no where three more showed up, and than I was watching multiple targets move at once, since at that time they all moved rather close to each other and grouped up.  That’s around the time they all moved up in a weird fashion “which can be described if asked”   The only time I could really count them was when they all moved weirdly up together.  They would dim down and disappear and reappear out of nowhere.  But when they moved up together , they all stayed lit up, allowing me to count quickly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> But the most craziest part is when a bright one, “some are brighter than others” Shot out three more of these ufo’s .  One came out straight down.  Then the other two shot out at a downward 45 degree angle , one on each side.   The climax lasted maybe, 4-8 mins  then if they didn’t dim down and disappear, they moved slowly out of the South East sky, and continued moving to and threw the south southeast sky, until I could not see them no more threw my window.   But , the way they move makes no sense, and the way they accelerate is UNBELIVABLELY fast!!  They seem to be able to stop just as fast as well! 	I have a lot more to say but don’t want to ramble on.  There is so much to gain from what I’m seeing.  I can only hope you take me serious.  I would gladly upload the video I‘ve got but my camcorder use’s 8mm tapes, but I’ve burned it to a dvd+R disc, but I cant get my computer to read it!!!!  I could mail a copy????? When I video taped I opened my window ”even though it was freezing” and removed my screen and video taped while my camera sat completely still!  Some of the video is really convincing!!!   Now, I love outer space and stargazing!  I just turned 29 this year , so for about 15 years now I’ve avidly looked at the sky.  And I wouldn’t be writing this, nore would I have lost any sleep the first night, if I had stopped watching  what I thought might  have been a quasar ‘ which didn’t alarm me until it moved!”, just one second before it started moving.  But when that star/quasar started moving, well lets just say that’s 3 seconds of movement I’ll never forget! I need more and better cameras, I need professionals to see this!!!!!!    Please contact me!!!!!!!!   I don’t want to be famous, I just want the truth !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! P.s I just seen that I can mail my dvd+R disc to you so, I will do so.  And the disc will contain my best 15 seconds and all the footage I can stuff on one disc.  If you can not get it to play, I&#39;m going to use a different burner to copy it, and i will send it again if you have problems<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date is approximate.

My girlfriend was talking to her mother on the phone and she had me on the phone as well.  I was listening to my girlfriend talking to her mother through my Bluetooth device.<n> <n><n> <n><n> While walking around this apartment complex, I happened to look up through the trees, toward the south.  I saw a bright light in the sky traveling northbound.  At first I thought this was a plane that had just taken off from the airport with its landing lights still on.  Then I noticed that it wobbled as it traveled and had no flashing lights on it.  It was also a little larger and brighter than any of the stars in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Still thinking this was a plane, I found a larger opening in the trees and continued to watch it.  It appeared to stop briefly a couple of times.  The light traveled until it was almost straight up from where I was. It was still slightly south of me though. It just stopped in the sky and hovered.  There was no noise to it either.  As I watched this thing hover, I could see two horizontal lights on the sides of it.  For a moment I thought it could be a blimp with words scrolling on the sides of it but it was too small or too high, to be a blimp.  And a blimp has the lighted words on opposing sides.  This thing had the lights forward on each side, not opposite of each other.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I stood and looked at this thing, I realized this was not a plane and told my girlfriend to go outside and look at it.  She, in turn, told her mother to go outside and look too.  My girlfriend did not go outside but her father, who was with her mother, went outside at her mother’s request.  He said he didn’t see it.  I told them that it was the brightest looking &#34;star&#34; in the sky, just south of where the moon was.  Nobody else saw this light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I watched this light, it began backing up and travelling southbound, the way it had come.  As it did, it dropped something.  What it dropped looked like a piece of glitter, but obviously larger.  It sparkled for about a second and then was no longer visible.  The light dropped about 4 or 5 of these things that I could see.  After that, the object flickered and looked like it disappeared.  It then lit back up and flickered some more.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I heard some people walking toward me so I looked toward them to point this object out to them.  I wanted someone else to see this besides just me.  Well, the people who were coming toward me went into an apartment before reaching my location.  I looked back up at the sky, where the object was, and noticed it was no longer visible.  I wish I had watched it to see if it just flickered out or if it traveled somewhere else.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was some cloud cover and this object appeared to be below the clouds.  I kept watching for it all night after this and never did see it again.<n>

They were traveling at normal airplane speed than two split up and took off at a much faster speed , then they all went they&#39;re separate ways. They were flying lower than i would expect a normal aircraft. Also, the direction they were headed leaded me to believe they came from behind my community of house, and behind my community of houses is not much of anything for miles and miles.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date is approximate.

12/1/09 21:30|Lake Wales|FL|Triangle|1-2 minutes|It initially resembled a large orange light ,but once I got closer, it looked like three orange lights in the shape of a triangle.|12/12/09|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/073/S73559.html|276|ndxe200912| It initially resembled a large orange light ,but once I got closer, it looked like three orange lights in the shape of a triangle.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I want to start off by saying that I am incredibly skeptical when it comes to this subject, but I witnessed something last night that I cannot explain. I attend a local college and left class around 9:30pm. On my way home (headed north on Highway 27), I saw a bright orange light ahead of me. The full moon was abnormally large, so I assumed Earth may have been extra close to a particular star or planet. The light was too big to be a plane or helicopter, and at first, it appeared to be too high up to be either of those. As I continued driving, I realized it wasn’t a planet or star, because I seemed to be getting closer to it. At this point, I was trying to figure out what in the heck I was looking at. It was too high to be a light at the top of a tower, but it wasn’t moving or blinking either. As I got closer, the object got bigger, almost as if it were floating above the new soccer field on the south end of town. I turned right on Hunt Brothers Road, and at t! his point, I had a car right on my bumper. I kept looking at the light, which appeared to be almost directly above me. When I looked up, I saw three orange lights that formed a tight triangle. I kept trying to get a better look at it, but because I was in a vehicle, it was hard to see something that close (yet still so high in the air). I nearly had my whole head of the window when the lights quickly moved east (much too fast to be a plane, jet or helicopter). When this happened, I noticed that car behind me basically stopped in the middle of the road. They must have been watching too, and when the lights moved so quickly, they slammed on their brakes. When I looked back up, the lights were gone. This is where it gets even weirder… I immediately called my husband (who is even more of a skeptic than I am!). When I started telling him what I saw, he didn’t laugh or make jokes, he was actually listening and being serious about it. After I told him what I saw, he said, “That is! so weird. I am not kidding you, I saw the same thing on my wa! y home f rom work.” He works in a city north of Lake Wales and had seen this same thing two hours before I had seen it. As he headed south on Highway 27, he saw the bright orange light. It disappeared before he made it into Lake Wales. As he traveled east on Highway 60, the light reappeared about five miles east of the Lake Wales. This time, there were three lights in the shape of a triangle. He said he kept starting until it disappeared. The distance between where I saw the triangle and where he witnessed it is about 10 miles. For two skeptics to see the same thing, at different times, in slightly different locations, and NOT be able to explain them… that is strange in itself. Part of me wants to believe it has something to do with the bombing range located to the south of us (in Avon Park), but I really can’t say.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

All with flashing red &amp; white lights.

I do however have it on my phone and in respect to your wishes I will do my best to make it as professional as possible.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Over the past month I have noticed unusual occurences daily in the nights sky.  I have recorded several of these sittings on both a camcorder and my phone.  One night the image was so clear i was able to depict an unusual craft suspended in space!  Needless to say I am an artist and was able to render a picture of the craft in the air.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The first sighting I saw was around the beginning of December.  Nightly I look to the stars and the Universe in search of answers as many have done over the expanse of life. This particular night I stepped out with my dog to allow her to use the restroom. Looking into the Universe as I have done every night past. I noticed two unusually bright stars in the sky, so I stood outside and watched them for sometime. 30 minutes perhaps I would say. Emitted from the objects i noticed what appears to be a unifomity thats not noticed from stars. Looking at light closely we notice it steches into what appears to be a burst of light and there is no formality among the light. Unless the light is directed! Nor is it geometical to the eye.<n> <n><n> <n><n> However I noticed a pattern in the light that i saw. Which is clealy distinguishable among the stars, as the light emitted from them differ from star light. Coming out of the object on the top or upper side of the object is what appears to be a triangle of light. This triangle of light appears to be beems of light one would have to assume. I do not know what else to make of it. Emitted from the bottom half of the craft or object is what appears to form a upside down &#34;Y&#34;. I have gotten my girlfriend to see if she could see anything and she said it looked like a peace symbol. Thats extremely close to what I have been seeing and she see&#39;s it too.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It seems my phone has reached its limit on characters. So it seems this email will have to be split up. I am sorry!<n>

Again I apologize as I have no other means to report my sightings. But I feel as if the sightings warrent some type of investigation.<n> <n><n> <n><n> If you are familiar with the HAARP project and their secretive studies. You would then know about the technology to control the weather among various of other things.<n> <n><n> <n><n> While outside I noticed the Y part moving around. As well was the craft, though the moving from the craft was not much. I was still able to see it was not fixed in space as stars appear to the nacked eye. About 5-10 minutes I noticed the waether went from clear skies to being covered in clouds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Although the clouds moved in, these lights could still be seen as they are the brightest object in the sky. As i watched and thought about what was before me, I could notice the light would get brighter and then fade almost enitirely out almost. It was from the clouds! Remeber I am an artist, so I have a keen eye for proportions in perspective to that of our visual field. The light getting bright was it coming closer to me. As the light got closer it intensified in brightness and size!  While outside watching them to determine what I was seeing was real. I noticed that they both emitted some type of search/spot light. This could be seen as something clearly above the clouds was lighting clouds up below it. This light appeared as a search light of some sort. At this point I was starting to get frightened. Basically I was right by the entrance of the house, as uncertainty coursed through me. As I watched the light circle around, and at times lighting up the clouds. It came to stop on me. I stood there helpless, wanting to run inside though was unable to move. Which lead and leads me to believe this was or is some type of probe of some sort. Standing there it fealt as if information was being expelled from me. I too took notice it seemed to extract the information in waves, rather than all at once. It seemed almost rythmatic!  When i was able to run, I ran inside. By this point...sorry another email inc<n>

My first thought was that it was sunlight reflecting off a aircraft.Then it dawned on me that I could not see any aircraft anywhere in the sky. I then began to walk to the back of the property when I saw one and then a second flash a little to the west of where I saw the first flash. These two flashes where white instead of orange. I watched for a few minutes but saw nothing else and went back to the dog walking thing. After several minutes I turned around and looked at the spot where I had seen the flashes and saw a large ball of light that I at first thought was a star. Then it became clear this was not a star and was blinking. The blinking reminded me of a old rotating police light. The light was white and I could see flashes of blue or green in it. There was another smaller blinking light underneath and to the west of the larger light that wa! s moving very slowly as if it were searching for something. I walked back to the house and continued to watch the lights and got my mom to come outside and look. She agreed that the lights were odd and did not look like any aircraft. We then went back inside and due to the cold and I came back out a few minutes later and the lights were gone. I was never nervous while observing this, just curious as to what the light could be and how odd it was to be there.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC NOTE:  Witness indicates that date of the sighting is approximate.

Two of the lights were red, and the third light was white. The white light was pulsing while the two red lights were constant.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object appeared to be rotating while floating through the sky. It was a slow rotation, so it was obvious it was not a plane, and that the lights were not alternating colors. It wasn&#39;t a jerky rotation either. It was very smooth, and it even seemed like it moved through the sky with ease. As if it was effortless for it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object was grayish in color...more like metallic silver... which was only noticed when the object came closer to our direction. (We were stopped at a red light.) If it&#39;s lights weren&#39;t on, it would have probably blended in with the sky more.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There were three observers. The driver being a female 30 years of age. Front passenger female 25 years of age. Backseat passenger male 10 years of age. Our car was headed West on Mowry.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There were planes in the sky at different altitudes. The sky had light clouds with a full moon, so some stars were visible.<n>

As we traveled down YY hwy towards hwy 68, I caught sight of the object it quickly disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Oddly enough when I saw it I thought it was a huge helicopeter landing at the animal adventure ranch.  I made a note of the time which was 6:40 cst.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We traveled on and made it to FF hwy and went westerly.  It was in the western sky when i saw it again, but this time it was a huge fireball.  I kept losing sight of it as it was traveling and I was traveling around curves and trees were blocking me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The last time I saw the object it was 7:03 I saw it a total of four different times.  Two times it looked to be on fire and thrusting towards salem.   When I saw them for the third time, it was like a big object in the sky on fire.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At one point the fire ball seemed to be half the size of the moon.  It was huge.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I lost sight of the object when we turned right on Hwy 72 towards Rolla, and the Fireball was presumed to go the other direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It appeared to be flying at the altitude of  low flying helicopters.  In fact this looked almost exactly like something I saw in 2002 that was reported here, except that object was lime green, and this fireball was orange.<n>

When we became  were aware that  it really was following us we pulled over.  It stopped as we did.  At that time it would dart up and down and back and forth.  Stopping abruptly unlike any other flying object could.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As we continued to travel south on 140, we kept track of it following us.  Whenever we would stop, it would do the same thing as when we first stopped.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Finally reaching Lake of the Woods, which is 45 minutes from where we started, it stopped once again.  This time it was dipping in the sky, skipping as it decended.

However, the flight had already left. I found my 3 lights low on the western horizon, and they would move among each other, go up and down, and fade out and back in again. Then they were joined by two more sets of three lights, evenly spaced on either side but several miles out who also danced around similarly.  I watched them for approximately 1/2 hour before I returned to my office (they were still there when I left).<n> <n><n> <n><n> The lights changed from yellow to red to white to orange.  They would fade out and return.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As mentioned above, this is a remote village with only two airplanes that come a day. There are no other planes that go over our village (we are on the shore of the Arctic ocean).<n>

It was between 7 and 8 pm, it was dark already, some clouds. I was having a smoke on my balcony which faces west. I see planes almost every day far and close, so I know planes. I lived for over 8 years near the Miami International Airport, before I moved to this new place. I know airplanes, how they move their colors, the sound, just the way they move is enough to tell me that what I was seeing that night were not planes. They move too smooth and no noise, the color of the lights also was different. Planes are required to have green and red lights so that it is possible to tell if they plane is approaching or getting farther away. Those crafts I saw had no lights like this. What they had was lights bluish white which blinked, like on and off, on and off. They just felt strange, this is the only way I can describe. After seeing planes all my life, these jus! t were different. Now they were traveling from my left to my right, since my balcony faces west, they were moving from south to north. There is nothing south except the sea so go figure were they came from. My first sighting of these strange crafts was on November probably mid November 2009. Then in the middle of December, I was smoking again at around 7:30 pm and I saw them again, this really stroke as fancy, I mean do they do this every other day? I have not seen them anymore. There were maybe 5 to 7 of these things, they were not in any kind of formation. I would say they were in a circular formation, if you can call that a formation. Both instances I saw them at the same angle of view, I would say 60 degrees, I think, with the horizon being 0 and straight up from my head being 90. It is hard because I live in the fourth floor. There used to be a base down here, the homestead base, but it has been close since the mid 1990s.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Now I want to tell you about another sighting I had a few years back, the reason is that that craft was also coming from the south. This craft I saw in this occasion I got to see its shape, it was a charcoal triangle, not black, dark but it had a sort of blue around it. This was seen by 4 people, including me. We saw it and then some one said, that is what people see like UFO don&#39;t you think? No nose and the same smooth going which planes don&#39;t have, it is like they are not feeling the resistance of the air around them or something, this is the best way I can explain.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I believe in the so call aliens, not only because of the sightings in modern times, but I think these beings have been coming and going way before man ever walked the earth. But I don&#39;t know why I have the feeling these triangles are “Made in the USA” just something. You have seen how the government can hide things like the stealth fighter, the blackbird SR71, and Aurora, we are talking technology which was developed 50 years ago, so imagine what they have now. When will we see this technology? As soon as they have a better one.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I also believe that not all aliens come from this universe by traveling billions of miles, I think there is enough evidence to show some come from other realities as well. I guess those too fall in the alien category.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Can contact me if it is worth it.<n>

So a couple minutes later I get up and looking at this star for about 2-3 minutes and kind of wondering what the hell, Cause I&#39;ve never noticed this star either. It takes off...it dips down and goes to the north very fast I&#39;m still puzzled today!!! Watch the skies!!!I tell my friends about it and they look at me like I&#39;m crazy or something.  It was about a week earlier my parents called and told me about this, they were in bed about 11 pm watching tv the lake had just frozen over and they don&#39;t have neighbors&#39; around, but this big yellowish color light was shining up from the lake they watched it out the window for about 20 minutes then it just like shut off and was gone...  I don&#39;t know what is going on but something is....<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC NOTE:  Witness indicates that date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))<n>
12/1/09 03:05|Holland|OH|Triangle||second UFO in same area|12/12/09|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/073/S73535.html|289|ndxe200912| second UFO in same area<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is the second time I have seen a UFO in the same area.  The space craft has lights and its kind of triangle and round at the same time. As i drive up the street i see bright lights low to the ground and as i get closer it is very clear that it is not a low airplian that it is something that is not normal. It then starts to slowly fly away so I try to keep up with it, but I lost it going through my neighborhood. I think that its looking for something it seems.  I have taken picture but it does not show up well at night, it seems strange that i have seen this UFO more than once in a very short time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

12/1/09 03:00|Woodbridge|NJ|Rectangle|5-7 minutes|2:50AM - Woodbridge, NJ - UFO Spaceship sighting - 5 windows - bright light in windows.|12/12/09|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/073/S73538.html|290|ndxe200912| 2:50AM - Woodbridge, NJ - UFO Spaceship sighting - 5 windows - bright light in windows.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Around 2:50AM, I looked out of the window, and saw what appeared to be a spaceship out side of my window. It was very low in the sky--maybe 50 feet above a house. It was a square shape, but not a perfect square because of its rounded edges. There were five windows – one row of three and one row of two. Through the windows, I could only see bright white light – a square full of light. It wasn’t the same as looking through a house window where you can see objects better because of the light, and night outside.  All I could see was light. The object was moving about 10 mph. Then it disappeared behind a tree to the other side of my building. I ran to another window in my apartment, and then I could see it again. I ran back into my bedroom to get my cell phone to take a picture, and ran back to the window, and it was still there--moving very slowly!  Unfortunately, just as I started to take the picture, it picked up speed and disappeared again!<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

12/1/09 02:00|Monmouth|OR|Disk|3 minutes|Four rounded lights were located along the side , along with a luminating bottom on the craft and a rounded top and bottom.|12/12/09|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/073/S73574.html|291|ndxe200912| Four rounded lights were located along the side , along with a luminating bottom on the craft and a rounded top and bottom.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This craft was seen to the South or Monmouth, Oregon, possibly located in Benton County to the North or Corvallis, Oregon. The craft held still for 30-60 seconds at which time it slowly moved to the West a very slight distance (possibly 20 yards). The lights were located along the side (I saw four) rounded lights, along with a luminating bottom on the craft. Light illuminated around the craft slightly and the round lights appeared to be white or yellow. It was dark outside and this was not a star. It was clearly a UFO, not any airplane or helicoptor.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
12/1/09 00:45|Bloomington|IN|Fireball|3 seconds|When driving, a moderately large and bright fireball shaped object was seen falling from the sky.|12/12/09|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/073/S73533.html|292|ndxe200912| When driving, a moderately large and bright fireball shaped object was seen falling from the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When driving back to my apartment at about 0:45 on December 1st, 2009, I saw a large, moderately bright, yellow to orange fireball shaped object falling from the sky towards the earth. I only saw this for a very short time, as I was driving. It stayed lit and falling until it fell behind the horizon. There was a tail to the object. It was long and consistent throughout the entire fall. It was larger than any meteor or shooting star I had ever seen. It did not move at a very fast rate.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
12/1/09 00:23|Mesa|AZ|Disk|4 minutes|Bottle cap shaped UFO with red glow underneath, clearly seen from back yard on December 1st, 2009 .|12/12/09|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/073/S73536.html|293|ndxe200912| Bottle cap shaped UFO with red glow underneath, clearly seen from back yard on December 1st, 2009 .<n> <n><n> <n><n> Estimated Distance: 2-5 miles Estimated Altitude: 2000 ft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Shape: Saucer with some height on sides like a bottle cap but double the relative height.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Features: Red glow underneath with intensity that seemed to fluctuate in coordination with the UFO&#39;s movement.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Story:  I went out side my home to have a cigarette - no smoking indoors. A red light first caught my attention.  As I looked on, I saw a saucer shaped object.  At first I assumed it was a plane or helicopter and it&#39;s altitude seemed close to the altitude where I have seen helicopters hovering in the past.  The UFO was descending and approaching.  Within 30 seconds the UFO was close enough to see very clearly but didn&#39;t appear to get closer than around a mile or two.  From my line of site the UFO began around 30 degrees above one of our trees in the backyard and eventually moved to low to see.  I walked to the other side of the yard in an attempt to see around this large tree but after 3 or 4 minutes couldn&#39;t locate the UFO so I went inside.  The UFO was in my view for around 3-4 minutes. My view of the object was clear and the UFO was absolutely not a helicopter nor airplane.  The craft appeared to move or &#34;float&#34; in all directions although it never made any radical maneuvers or cha! nges in acceleration.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About this report: written 3 minutes after the sighting occurred.  Since I am not in some remote, isolated, location, it seems odd to view something so strange - whether it be a UFO or some air-force experiment. I cannot say what it was. All I can report as certain, is that what I saw was not any type of normal aircraft. I can&#39;t say whether it is due to the distance of the craft or not, but if the object was making any sound, I couldn&#39;t hear it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About the whiteness: 39 year old male who has never seen nor reported a sighting before.  I have also never experienced nor reported any form of anomalous or paranormal experience. My eyesight is currently 21x20 and I have never required or used glasses.  My house where this sighting occurred is located in a normal, non-remote, neighborhood and there are no buildings, high rises or stadiums near enough to view.<n>
