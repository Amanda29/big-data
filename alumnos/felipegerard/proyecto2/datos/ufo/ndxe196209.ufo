It was probably a Saturday with no school the next day so we were allowed to stay up late.  I was 9 or 10 years old in 1962 or 1963 and at the store they were offering Mickey Mouse helium balloons.  I brought one home that evening and was showing it off to the neighborhood kids on Hunter AFB in the military housing were we lived.  It was probably about 9 or 10pm because the street lights had come on and the sky was dark.  We decided to play a game with the balloon like this:  We placed torn up pieces of paper between the ears of the Mickey Mouse balloon because the ears touched.  We then let the balloon rise above the street light out of sight and then with a firm jerk on the attached kite string dislodged the pieces of paper from between Mickey&#39;s ears, down they would float into view below the street light and whoever co! llected the most pieces of paper won.  On the second or third round something amazing happened.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The balloon was above the street light out of sight, I jerked the the string, and suddenly a luminous disk about the size of a car suddenly appeared and then zig-zagged half-a-dozen times above the street light first side to side then back and forth in a cross like pattern alternating aggressively, presumably it was checking out the balloon. Everyone stood there watching the object, while the pieces of paper floated down around us, and then as suddenly as it appeared it disappeared. We were excited and so we collected the papers in a frenzy, stuffed them between the ears, and sent the balloon back up, jerked the string and almost the exact same thing happened again. Except this time instead of disappearing after the zig-zag it took off in a straight line fast but still slow enough we could follow it into the distance. My brother ran to get my parents but by the time they came out to see it it was so distant they could not distinguish it from a star.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Of course, we tried to repeat the event but it only worked twice.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The disk was glowing silvery-amber, about the size of a car, no sound, complete silence, incredibly zippy, directly overhead so we could only see the underside during the zig-zag. When it traveled away the second time I did not note anything additional like lights or anything like that. Was too excited to make any additional observations.<n>

They did not spin or make a sound and I will never forget it!<n> <n><n> <n><n> While on a picnic at Island Beach State Park, my mother yelled &#34;Look at that!&#34; and my father and I also witnessed 3 saucers flying in a triangular pattern heading south east out over the ocean. They were high up enough that all that was visible was the underside. It was still daylight out.   They appeared to be silvery metal discs/saucers, did not spin, did not make a sound,and disappeared from view at a high rate of speed.  I was 11 years old and &#34;bought&#34; my father&#39;s explanation that it must be experimental aircraft out of Lakehurst NJ air station. My father never wanted us to talk about it.  We never did until I was 20 and came home one day with the announcement that what we must have seen HAD to be a &#34;flying saucer&#34; because no one in this world had ever succeeeded in making an aircraft shaped like a saucer fly.  My mother and I each drew a picture of what we saw and our drawings were identical.   I have no doubts at all of what I saw nearly 40 years ago. I am an office manager with a CPA firm and respected member of my community and rarely try to convince &#34;non-believers&#34; that it is ludicrous not to take reports of &#34;sightings&#34; seriously.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date and time are approximate.

It housed KC-135 tankers, B-52 and U-2 hangars, and 8 nuclear storage bunkers with 500 pound bombs. I held a top secret clearance; I was a member of the Combat Defense Force and Sentry Dog Handler.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were working twelve hour shifts during the crisis, it was near relief time when I looked out towards the sunrise, off into the calm, blue, orange sky and saw something strange. There was one small cloud with flashing lights moving inside of it, and he cloud was moving towards the no-fly-area.\ We K-9 units wanted to know what it was. We took a truck across the runway to the flight crews Quarters. Everyone was looking at the cloud as it slowly approached, making no noise, red, blue, yellow lights revolved inside the bubbling, boiling cloud like a carousel. It was now 30 feet above the ground and it seemed to be roughly 20 feet deep.<n> <n><n> <n><n> While staring at this spectacular object, I sincerely hoped no one would fire on it because we were all armed at the time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I went off duty for three days and came back to silence. Nobody talked about it. And nobody told me not to talk about it; except my mother. A strike on our facility would have been even more catastrophic for the United States than an attack on the east coast from Russia or Cuba.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Source indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

The altitude at a guess at 2,000 feet high. This was seen on September 4, 1962 at 3:30 pm Central Standard Time. Location of sighting was 2.6 miles south of St. Louis Lambert airport. The sky was clear and wind was calm. My mother was hanging clothes out to dry, and called out to me to come out and see the object. I rejected her offer for some time, but she insisted that it was  something I should see. When I finally went out and saw the object we talked and she asked if it could be Venus? I told her that it could not be because of the time of day and direction was eastward.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was a member of the St. Louis Astronomical Society at this time. My mom said I should get my telescope and take a look. At the age of 15 I wasn&#39;t totally coordinated yet, and I broke the front glass out of the front screen door. Trying to get the telescope out the door. I&#39;m adding for the time frame. It took a bit of work to gather the broken glass up before a got the telescope to the back yard.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Setting up the telescope. It was a Tasco refractor 60 mm objective lens, with a alt-azimuth mount. I first used the wide angle eyepiece to spot the object. I found it magnified well, but still rather small. I let my mom look through the scope and by this time we had the next door neighbors over also. So now we have our own star party. Three adults and one kid.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I let everyone take there time and look. Of course they all asked if I could get it bigger. I set the 3 X barlow and the strongest eyepiece. This set the magnification of 525 power. When I looked at the object it nearly filled the entire field of view.  I can only explain that I had it focused perfect!  It looked like a cue ball.  No markings.  Perfectly smooth and rather off white, not shiny.  It did not give any glow off.  No sense of spinning motion, and no noise at all.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is important. This object has not moved one nanometer in an hour of time. Nothing in the heavens or earth can do that!  When you view the moon at full power with that telescope it&#39;s like a big train moving by. This didn&#39;t move. I expected it to move and was in total disbelief at what I was seeing. I let my mom and the neighbors husband and wife both take long looks at the object and we all agreed that it was not moving. I kept saying this can&#39;t be happening! No one is going to believe me at the next Astronomical meeting. But I got witnesses!  Better yet I&#39;ve done lunar eclipse photos, and said I will be getting my camera and special eye mount for it and I&#39;ll be back. Never had a chance to move.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When we look back at the time in history, it was as one of the worst in nuclear confutations. The &#34;Cuban missile crisis&#34; was happening. I no sooner said that I was going to get the camera when I hear a very load jet aircraft take off. Living for many year near the airport we grew accustomed to the different sounds of the commercial, and air force aircraft flying and even crashing near by as a F-86 did a mile down the road. This was the sound of afterburners and full throttle. As soon as the plane came above the tree line I spotted it as a B-47. She was doing a tight circle as we literality turned our bodies around as it circled and climbed for altitude. On the second sweep around I was beginning to wonder if it had something to do with our visitor in the sky above. I was a lucky hunch, because at that very moment I scream! Look it moved! What had been stationary for an hour did a sudden straight vertical movement to twice the altitude in a split second and stopped. The B-47 was still in hot pursuit with all engines at full throttle. It kept a circular pattern as she climbed up toward the object. After about the fourth revolution around the B-47 chase was over. I saw the object go from that second position to ascend straight up out of sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My mom insisted that I report this to the Air Force base at Lambert Field. I looked up a few numbers that sounded official and dialed them. When I mentioned I wanted to report a UFO, they responded I could get in a lot of trouble doing this. Did my parents know I was doing crank calls to the US Government? The last call I made I did get through to an Air Force official and said I wanted to report a UFO and it was being chased by a B-47. He said that&#39;s ridicules there&#39;s no B-47 aircraft in the air. I said if you don&#39;t believe me look out your window. He hung up quickly.  No report was ever made to the papers that I could ever recall.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Iwould like to know if anyone in the St. Louis area saw this object also.<n>

Chased pointlessly by naval jet air<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am only writing in the hopes that you will pass this along to the person riding a jet from Vanouver to LA and had basically passed over my residence when he-she saw a strange craft and has always wondered if it was a &#39;sun dog&#39;. Please relate this factual series of events.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I lived on an island in the Washinton  (US) Sa Juan Islands. My folks had gone to the mainland shopping for school clothes and I stayed home. Late in the morning, almost noon I was going to go check on our cattle and then take the dog down to the beach and throw sticks for him (he loved to swim after stcks).<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I rounded the back of the house for some reason I looked up and rather than the usual eagle or hawk that triggers the peripheral vision response, I saw something a bit out of the ordinary no jet although they were always to be seen flying far overhead, rather I saw a huge disk shaped object (relatively slowly meandering across the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Of course I was fascinated and started to run through my mental inventory of what kind of aircraft it could be when it suddenly traveled south at such a speed as to boggle ones senses (I knew about G forces and such and I couldn&#39;t equate that anything could move so fast from a near motionless state (no flames of rocket or contrail or such).<n> <n><n> <n><n> Well it disappeared over the horizonto the south and I just stood there staring, my dog bumped my leg and he was staring too. (He liked to chase anything in the air, a would run around undernearh birds, stare at planes and such...a Spaniel with a natural affinity for airborne creatures.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So just as we started down the drive the &#39;thing&#39; reappeared moving fairly rapidly back toward us (northerly direction) when it was about halfway toward us a flight of jets came over the horizon in pursuit. I surmised they were from the Whidbey Island naval Air Station.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This slightly dull silverish/gray disk got almost directly overhead at a fair height I guestimate 20,000 to 25,000 ft when the jets almost  (within a mile or two) reached the object. It then went straight up an! d dwindled to the size of a pin just before it vanished in the stratosphere.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The jets had hit their afterburners and were climbing in chase on long tails of flame. It was really quite spectacular. Then when the thing disappeared and the jets reached their ceiling, they banked off to the south presumably to return to Whidby Island.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;ve only mentioned it to a few people over the years more as an anecdote than to any purpose, because I don&#39;t personally care what people believe as long as they don&#39;t try to shove theirs down my mental craw. So please...I&#39;ve always believed in them because of this event...but tell the person who is living in doubt, tweren&#39;t no sun dog or St Elmo&#39;s fire or a curious behaving weather balloon, Alice. It was a large disk shaped object that performed aerial maneuvers that even today would be impossible for humans to match. (We&#39;d have been splattered all around the inside of the thing). And since there was no evident mode of propulsion one would have to presume that the drive was gravitational  They&#39;d have to have control over gravity to negate the g forces.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So such is life, sorry no abduction or strange probings, no photos and my dog, Thumper, the only other witness is long since in that happy field and stream in the sky. So now you have it and my conscience is clear and free.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Oh, I forgot to mention it was completely noisless although many seconds later the sound of the jets reached us. The object traveled very quietly, wouldn&#39;t that make airports nicer to live near?<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  The date indicated for the event may be exact, but we are not sure.

I have never spoken publicly of it, but now, at the age of 45, I am interested in finding out exactly what I saw. My mother, father and I were returning from our native Vancouver, Canada, back to LA aboard a United Airlines prop (a DC?). We were seated in the tail, port side, and over the US-Canada border area. I looked out the window as we flew through bright gaps in the clouds. The day was otherwise bright, despite the clouds. I observed a circular object, totally metallic with a rim completely around it, a mini silver Saturn, if you will. It was approx. 20-30 ft. in diameter and hovering near the the fuselage, between the wing and tail. It rotated, and it reflected our airliner on its--the UF0&#39;s--own surface. It was silent. I motioned to my father, who momentarily looked grim. He dismissed it as something, but sounded suspiciously evasive. I don&#39;t recall a reaction from my mother or anyone else aboard. The craft was silent and remained in view for several minutes. My parents have been deceased for more than 30 years and thus can&#39;t add more to what I have stated.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was only one object. It appeared to tilt and spin as it hovered by the fuselage of the United Airlines&#39; prop airliner. The sky was a bright blue. I viewed the object as our a/c passed through an expanse of clouds. I was excited; my father was uncharacteristically quiet, subdued. We never spoke of the incident ever again, though my father later in life evinced a belief in UFO&#39;s. My mother thoroughly dismissed the phenomenon. I sighted the object as a child. I am now 45 years of age. I am a teacher, with a Master&#39;s in English. I am currently working on my Ph.D in psychology. My father was a factory employee, a personnel manager. My mother was a typist. I don&#39;t know if my report is of any value to you, being nearly 40 years old and such. I offer it to you for what it&#39;s worth. The incident is etched onto my brain. I still wonder whether I saw a true UFO or what is called a &#34;sun dog.&#34;<n>
