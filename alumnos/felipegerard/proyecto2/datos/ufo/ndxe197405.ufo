Holloman AFB 5/6,1974<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had travelled to Odessa Tx with my roommate (((name deleted)) of Calif.) to his sisters house in Odessa for the weekend.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We left Odessa, then a small town, and headed home on rt. 385. we headed West on 185 to N.Mex. and Holloman where we were stationed. We had spent the Holiday weekend with his sister and neice.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When we left Odessa we headed North on 385 to Seminole and grabbed a coffee.  We then continued to Hobbs before we turned West.  We were on Hwy #529 then headed for Artesia.  It was an &#39;empty&#39; land back then.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After the #180 junction, and we knew where we were going, we stopped, to take a leak.  Back then the land was empty and dark.  Not like my NYC my home... so here it gets strange.  We stopped about 1/8mile outside town to take a leak near a phone booth.  We got back in the car and started to drive and in about 1/4mile a UFO appeared in the sky, it came from the west and stopped about 250ft above us, it was hovering on us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Jim pushed it to 140mph. and it held, we slowed to 20mph and it held; we stopped, and got out.  It had sparks flying out of it when we stopped...and I said to Jim, it looks like it is having trouble, Jim agreed. It was 11:15pm then...next time we looked it was 12:30pm.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We got back in his car and tried to outrace it; we couldn&#39;t (we went 160mph); we slowed and it did not leave. The entire incident to point was about 5.5miles in duration, an 2hrs.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then we saw 3 F-4&#39;s with BLUE tails headed towards us. We knew the planes because we were their mechanics. The round, UFO was still sparking when we stopped to watch... then, in an instant it was hundreds of miles away to the North West, at the base of the upcoming mountains (near Roswell)(NOT ARTESIA)... the F-4&#39;s, OUR PLANES; made the 120 degree turn to pursue the craft and it had gone from here to there (300miles) in an instant. It was a 60 degreee turn, with no radius, and just a simple 140mph backwards motion to a simple 60 degree turn to the Northwest.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The Planes arced over our heads, and thier efforts seemed so insignificant to the speed the craft was able to move at.  The &#34;Saucer&#34;, and it was a &#39;saucer&#39; this time; moved from the center of the flat desert where we were...to the near side of the upcoming mountains in 1 second, what our planes could do in 20; about 200miles! I need to go back there and drive it again. I want to! I wish i could find ((name deleted)) od Calif.; My Air Force friend to remember again. The whole base was in an uproar and at TOP-LEVEL Security when we got in at 5am... and alot of incidents occurred after that date...alot of CONFIRMATION took place; and the base, which allowed us to drink cases of beer at TRINITY SITE; was closed by ARMY troops. When we headed to Trinity that friday we were all of a sudden surrounded by armed troops turning us back. Two weeks later there were 1,000&#39;s of lights in the sky... and anyone that was stationed there then can realate them... was that our real first encounter??? I Don&#39;t know I only know what I and Jim saw, and what happened.<n>

It was moving straight and level at about 2000 ft above the ground.  It was dull gray (pewter) in color and made no sound.  It had no appendages like wings or tail.  The visibility at the time was very good.  We were about a mile or so from Lake Michigan in southern Michigan and I expect the object was moving from south to north in a line parallel to the lake.  The lake would have been to our rear.  It was at about a 45 deg angle from us and appeared oval in shape, somewhat like a dull gray metallic football.  I speculate at this time that if we could have seen it from other angles that it may have been a disc.  I estimate the size to be about 100 feet long.  It had no lights.  It was directly in front of us when we first saw it and it continued in a straight line until it was out of sight.<n>
5/22/74 05:30|Mescalero Indian Reservation|NM|Rectangle|Two Hours|Huge rectangular object emmitting intense white light across roadway with extremely loud roar|4/18/12|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/088/S88040.html|3|ndxe197405| Huge rectangular object emmitting intense white light across roadway with extremely loud roar<n> <n><n> <n><n> Dear Sirs.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was browsing youTUBE videos on various topics when I came across one on the Coast to Coast broadcast with George Knapp as host.  He was interviewing Peter Davenport.  And when Mr. Davenport gave the url for his website I wrote it down, and sure enough it was accurate.  I meanwhile listened to the whole broadcast that was from March 2012 {about a week ago.}  But towards the end of the show Mr. Davenport urged listeners who believe they had seen a ufo to &#34;write down their sighting&#34; and then go to his website and list the report there.  So that is what &#34;I&#34; am doing now, as I feel that all reports are important of this nature and perhaps in time will aid researchers into figuring out who this phenomenon is all about.  With that said here is the description of my first sighting below...<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was late May of 1974 early on a Monday morning, approximately 5:30 A.M. &#34;ish&#34;...I was in the USAF stationed at Holloman AFB near Alamogordo, NM.  I was coming from a mountain community called Ruidoso, NM and heading down the mountains through the Mescalero Indian Reservation, heading West on Highway 70 ,heading back to Holloman.  I had spent the weekend in Ruidoso and attended the Horse Races, and did some shopping in the village.  It had rained the night before and the narrow mountain Highway could be a bit treacherous back then due to the narrow winding roads, and numerous deer and elk that roamed freely across the Reservation.  So I opted to spend the night at a local motel and head back early the next morning to get back to base in time for work {approximately 7:30AM.}  I had just come down the winding road from what is commonly called &#34;The Summit&#34; {being the highest point} between Ruidoso in the mountains and Alamogordo down on the basin floor.  There was a straight part of the highway that ran for about 2.5 miles.  At that time there was virtually no one who lived near that stretch of highway.  It was also &#34;foggy&#34; from time to time as I came down the mountains.  {Fog in this area is usually clouds that have lowered down into the upper crevices of the mountains.  The other type of fog normally seen in this area is caused from a &#34;hot pavement&#34; after a rain, when the humidity is high...it will rise from the pavement like a thick &#34;steam&#34;.}  As I rounded the last curve to the right coming down from the summit, I gasped as up ahead was the &#34;brightest light&#34; I had ever seen...it was not like a car light or street light, which were usually more &#34;yellowish&#34;...this one was &#34;white as snow&#34;, and was not shining &#34;at me&#34; but oddly enough was shining from &#34;right to left&#34; across the highway {which was East to West.}  I slowed down from about 50mph to about 25, as I came closer to where that light was emminating.  It appeared that is was coming from &#34;up a canyon beyond where the edge of a taller mountain met near the roadway&#34; just ahead of me.  At this point in time I experienced &#34;no fear&#34; just &#34;total curiosity&#34; as to what could be causing this odd light?  I continued to slow down as I had driven this stretch of road many times &#34;to and from&#34; the mountain town of Ruidoso on many weekends, although most of those trips were to and from in the daytime, but a few were occasionally at night...but I had &#34;never&#34; encountered a light of this nature before, either there or any where.  {I must make a note here that I have often seen a &#34;rain shower&#34; on the long stretches of highway in the southern New Mexico desert areas, where you can actually just drive right into the rain as if it was a &#34;curtain of moisture&#34; hanging from the clouds in front of me.  A very weird sensation to experience.  Very simila! r to driving through an &#34;automated car wash&#34; nowadays.}  With that said...this extreme, white light was stretching across the roadway ahead of me in the same fashion.  Whereas, most &#34;light&#34; tends to &#34;fade in and out&#34; of intensity from it&#39;s &#34;source&#34;...this light appeared to almost have an &#34;edge&#34; to it.  I figured the only way to find out where it was coming from was to drive into it and look up the canyon to the North.  {I also need to say at this point that when I drove at a distance I tended to play the car stereo often.  And sometimes I played it loudly and would sing along if I knew the song.  I had been doing this on my trip back to the base.}  But it suddenly dawned on me about the time I neared the light that I could no longer hear the radio or even the car engine as there was a very &#34;loud roar&#34; coming from outside my vehicle.  {But at the time I had not yet associated the roar and the light as having any connection to each other.}  But then I entered the light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was just the &#34;oddest&#34; effect as I drove into the light...just like laying on a beach as the tide rolled in to cover your legs...this emmense white light was consuming my vehicle as I passed through the edge of it.   And once I was apparantly consumed into it I slowed down to almost a stop and veered off the roadway to the shallow ditch, so as to not be hit by any other traffic which might be coming up behind me, although at that point I realized that there was virtually &#34;no one&#34; on that whole stretch of road that morning, except me.  Once I came to a stop.  I put my car in park.  I fumbled through my glove compartment for a pair of dark sunglasses.  I found them and put them on, and even with them on the light was so intense I had to hold my hands in front of my face.  Realizing this was not working I opened the car door stood out and turned and still holding my hands in front of my face, gazing as best I could through the dark sunglasses, I stepped up on the rim of the b! ottom of the opened door to raise myself up a bit for a better vantage point.  I frankly have no real recollection of &#34;time passage&#34; at this point.  I assume I stood there trying to see something amid that loud roar that seemed to be coming more-or-less from the same direction as the light source {to the North.}  I spent what I thought was the next &#34;few minutes&#34; going between holding my hands in front of my face to guard against the bright light, and cupping my hands over my ears due to the instense roar!  And there must have been some passage of time as the faintness of the sky, or clouds above the light appeared to be brightening also.<n> <n><n> <n><n> All of a sudden I realized that the &#34;white light&#34; was &#34;artificial&#34;...meaning it was other than &#34;natural daylight or sunlight&#34;.  That it was emmiting from either a man-made source, or an alternate source of power.  And as the &#34;natural daylight&#34; increased, the white artificial light &#34;decreased&#34;...to the point I could see that the white light was emmiting from &#34;four&#34; {4} round holes approximately twenty-feet {20} in diameter, and in a row from left to right against something that appeared to be solid and black.  {In my mind I equated these lights to the &#34;Hollywood Search&#34; lights that can easily be seen criss-crossing at a Hollywood Movie Premier.}  It was like a giant rectangular black box just sitting up in this field or valley against the mountainside.  And about the time this registered in my mind I saw the &#34;movement&#34;.  {Imagine for a moment you are at a stoplight on red, at night on a city street just after a rain, as the pavement glistens in the street and headlights...and as people scurry across the street in front of you...you can see the &#34;scissor-like movement&#34; of their legs, like waving your finger back and forth in front of a tv screen.}  This is the type of movement I noticed at the bottom of those big, white lights.  At this point my mind thought...&#34;They must be trying to make repairs on something&#34;?  And with that thought my next was &#34;repairs on what&#34;?  and &#34;Why&#34; in the middle of a &#34;field in the mountains&#34;? And oddly enough after that my next remembered thought was...&#34;this might be a UFO&#34;?  And with that thought a big &#34;gasp&#34; of instantaneous FEAR came over me.  &#34;Oh my God I need to get out of here&#34;.    I quickly got back into the car, shut the door and locked it.  {I remembered stories of people having a close encounter and their car engine stopped, and their watch stopped ticking, etc.  The roar of that sound was so loud still that I couldn&#39;t tell if my car engine was still on or not?  And the light was so bright that I couldn&#39;t see the face of my wristwatch.}  I felt like my only option was to step on the brake and put the car in gear and &#34;hit the gas&#34; and hope for the best.  And that&#39;s what I did and to my surprise I moved.  So I came up out of the ditch onto the pavement and drove like a &#34;bat out of Hell&#34; till I ran out of that white light just the same as I drove into i! t.  And once out of it...when the &#34;loud roar&#34; was behind me, I slowed down and stopped the car on the side of the road.  I got out and felt myself all over...as if to make sure that &#34;I was still in one piece&#34;?  And there behind me at a bit of a distance was the faint roar, and that still emmense white light across the road.  I just shook my head and and said to myself as I got back into my car an drove on...&#34;Man, no one is ever going to believe this&#34;.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I got back to the base in time to put on my 1505&#39;s and go to work on time.   {It was also a bit &#34;odd&#34; to me in thinking about this later that the &#34;whole event&#34; from first seeing the white light across the road in front of me, to driving into it, and parking near the ditch, and gazing at the light and seeing the movement near the ground below the beams...that quite a bit of time seemed to have passed.  Yet it was about 5:30AM or so when I left Ruidoso and it was normally about a &#34;one hour&#34; {60 minute} trek either way, but I got back to the base with plenty of time to change into my uniform of the day, and get to work, open up and make coffee for everyone else.  It was as if &#34;time had stood still&#34; during that whole event?}  But no one other than a couple of very close friends &#34;ever&#34; heard this story until I had been discharged from the USAF in 1976.  {I have another amazing event that happened to me while stationed at HAFB, NM that didn&#39;t have a resolution until almost twenty {20} years later.}. Some people might live their whole life and never have a ufo sighting, or close encounter.  And then there are those of us who feel like we have had &#34;more&#34; than our fair share.  But I will share the other encounters at another time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))<n>

5/15/74 21:00|Passaic|NJ|Cigar|30 minutes|We thought it was we were looking at a sky full of stars...until they all started to move....|9/2/05|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/045/S45267.html|6|ndxe197405| We thought it was we were looking at a sky full of stars...until they all started to move....<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was fourteen...me and my sister (15 then) was in our home..an apartment type above a tavern. I was in the kithen, my sister in the livingroom.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We lived on Van Houten Ave. on a corner.  Across from us was a factory/warehouse.  It had a generator that made a rumbling noise. I was washing dishes facing the side street.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My sister yelled for me to look out the window...she was excited.  She was looking out the front window facing Van Houten Ave. She kepet screaming for me to look towards the factory.  I stuck my head out the window and saw this object kind of hoovering over the factory.  It was HUGE.  It was kind of cigar shaped and I don&#39;t know if it made any sound really, because of the generator, but it seems to me that the sound was a bit different than usual.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Anyhow, it wasn&#39;t a blimp or anything I&#39;d ever seen, or have since seen.  I remember there was a light revolving around the (what I assume to be) &#34;nose&#34; of the vessel.  But the light didn&#39;t seem to be attached to anything, or be radiating from anywhere actually, it was just a light revolving around the nose.  This vessel hoovered there for about ten minutes give or take.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Me and my sister were hollering back and forth at each other trying to figure out what we were looking at, and what to do about it.  It just kind of sat there in mid air for a while, and then it turned it&#39;s nose straight up in a semi-slow motion, and it shot straight up in an instant it was gone.  No fire, no flames, no loud roar...nothing like that...It went straight into space and was gone instantly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This happened on one night, and on another night...same place, but I think it was a little earlier in the evening.  Me anad my sister were again in our home.  I was in the kitchen again, but I&#39;m not sure what room my sister was in.  My younger brother and a friend of his was outside jumping their bikes on a ramp.  All of a sudden we heard them screaming for us.  We thought something really bad had happened, and we ran down the stairs and out the door expecting something, I don&#39;t know what.  Anyways, we run out &#34;to help&#34; and find my brother and his friend staring at the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were like, &#34;What?!?&#34; and they both point straight up, and yell &#34;Look! Look! they&#39;re moving&#34;  we didn&#39;t know what they were talking about.  We looked up and saw a sky with stars...no big deal...at least that was our first reaction.  And that&#39;s what we told them...&#34;yeah okay, big deal..Stars!!!&#34;  But they kept hollering....&#34;No...No...Really....Watch &#39;em!!!  They&#39;re moving!!!&#34;  So we decide to humor them...so okay, we&#39;ll watch for a few minutes.  Just a clear night with a sky of stars.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Well, they did start to move!!!  Every one of them started moving.  they started out slowly, kind of making circles and designs...but it was each and every one of them...they started slow, and gradually got faster and faster, and faster, and then they all kind of shot towards each other and instantly stopped in a clump...for maybe five seconds...then they shot out in different directions, every one of them, and they were gone.  Not a star in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> None of us knew what to do, or say, we just all stared at each other.  I do think my brother said something to the fact that he was glad that we seen it too &#39;cause it kind of scared them.  I do remember trying to tell my mother about it...and she just looked at us like we were nuts or something, and dismissed it all as our imagination, or it had to be &#34;something else&#34;...but we all know what we saw...and actually, I don&#39;t care one way or another if someone wants to beleive me/us or not.  It happened, and I think about it and know that there&#39;s life out there some where.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I know too that we STILL don&#39;t have anything made on this planet capable of the speed and manuverability that these things had then, and this all happened some 31 years ago.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I just thought that if any one wanted to hear about it, I would share it.  I think it was kind of cool myself. Thanks for listening.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.  PD))<n>

I glanced up into the sky above the shopping center (the sky was dark, probably around 8 p.m.) and observed a disc-shaped object with a row of sequentially blinking circular lights traversing a large angle of the sky repeatedly. This back and forth path covered an angle of maybe 80 degrees or so and was at a low altitude; maybe 150 ft or so above the shopping center. Since the sky was dark the lack of reference points made a size estimation difficult, but it appeared maybe 6-8 feet in diameter. The object was totally silent and rapid in its motion. It was witnessed by a couple walking away from the carnival.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

The craft disappeared behind some trees and that was the last we saw of it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

It was probably 65 to 70 degrees.  I believe it was in 1974 although I&#39;m not sure of the month, and I was 11 years old.  I was returning home after school let out.  Close to home where I came into a clearing between 6-story apartment buildings, I was looking up facing south, and between about 60 and 75 degrees above the horizon, a small disc-shaped, grayish or silvery object caught my eye as soon as it emerged over the top of a building to my right.  It was travelling east (from my right to left) and was about to fly over, by my best estimate, John F. Kennedy International Airport.  It was probably between one half and one mile high and seemed fairly small...my guess would be about 10 feet in diameter.  It had no distinguishing characteristics.  I saw no smoke trail, heard no noise, and felt no strange vibes other than my own nervousness.  I don&#39;t think it was more than a half a mile away horizontally.  It never made any erratic movement and was moving at a quick pace...I&#39;m guessing about 150 mph.  A few seconds before it disappeared over the top of the building to my left, it had begun a smooth right turn toward the southeast and appeared to be climbing.  No wings were visible, and at this point it looked more like a cigar with a reflecting metal surface.  Then it was gone.  I was able to see this object clearly as my eyesight was perfect then, and I knew I&#39;d never seen anything like it before.  I remembered feeling shocked, perplexed and concerned, for I had no idea the source of what I&#39;d seen.  I was also annoyed that there was nobody else around for me to call attention to it.  Not wanting to risk embarrassment, it was several years before I&#39;d told anyone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

There was no tail, so I ruled out, afterburners, meteors, or any thing I had ever seen in the night sky before.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The color was beautiful, the object I saw as I was driving north on Rt. 9W passing through Esopus. I saw the object out my left window, it was visible for less than 5 seconds before it was out of sight, it could have been 10 miles up or 100 miles up, I had no frame of reference I could use to judge.<n> <n><n> <n><n> To this day I do not know what it was, so to me it was my experience of seeing an Unidentied Object in the air.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

His cousin was also visiting from Los Angeles. She was taking a late night flight back to L.A. and we took her to the Jackson airport to catch her plane. After we left the airport we drove back to Lexington. We were only a couple of miles or so from the airport when we noticed 3 very bright lights far ahead of us just above tree level. They were so bright that we couldn&#39;t see what was behind them. The lights were arranged like the landing lights on a 727, with equal spacing between them, but the center was a few feet higher than the outer two. They were very bright white, like the color of halogen lights. I thought it must be a jet coming into the airport, but they were only a bit above tree level, which puzzled me. My friend, Bill, and I were both puzzled when after a few minutes of driving toward the lights they hadn&#39;t moved. We came to a rural intersection where the road we were on &#34;T&#39;d&#34; into a larger, divided highway. We stopped at the stop sign at the intersection and just sat there for a few minutes trying to figure what they were. At this point, the lights were directly in front of us, shining directly at us, and they were so bright that we couldn&#39;t see what they were mounted on. We were away from any town and  there were no other cars or streelights. We eventually decided to continue on back to Lexington, and to do so we had to turn left onto the divided road. We pulled across the highway and median (which was paved at that point so you could turn left onto the divided road) and stopped on the highway shoulder. The lights were on my right (I was the passenger) and I stared at them out my window, still puzzling about what they could be. We were neither drunk nor stoned, the windows in the car were rolled down, and the radio was off. There was no sound except the idling car engine. Bill took his foot off the brake and let the car idle down the shoulder. At that point, the lights rotated very slowly and with such pr! ecision of movement I&#39;ve never seen. There was no sound. The lights rotated so that they were pointing directly at the car, and as precisely as they had rotated to stay pointing at the car, they now travelled beside us at the same elevation they had been and not more than about 300 feet away from us. They travelled alongside the car at the same speed we were moving, still idling down the shoulder. I have never been as scared as I was then, because it was clear to me that this craft, which we still couldn&#39;t see because of the intensity of the lights shining directly at us was following us. I urged Bill to &#34;floor&#34; the car and get the hell out of there, because it was so obvious that this thing was intentionally flying next to us and had responded to our movement. I had no idea what might happen next, but I was so scared that all I wanted to do was flee. Bill eventually accelerated gradually and pulled off the shoulder into the right most lane. The lights still stayed beside us. After a couple of minutes of this the car picked up speed. The lights ceased flying beside us but rotated again so that they always pointed toward the car. Then their altitude decreased and they crossed over the highway at very low altitude, maybe 20-30 feet above the roadway, went directly over the trees on the opposite side of the road and went straight down into the trees and disappeared. At this point, I got my courage up and asked Bill to turn the car around and go back. We came to a crossover in the median, did a U-turn and headed back. We got all the way to the intersection where we had turned originally, but never saw them again. We turned around again and headed toward Lexington. When we eventually came to a gas station that was open we pulled in so I could use the pay phone to call the Jackson Airport FAA. My father worked in radar for the FAA in Texas, and he had told me that they sometimes received calls about sightings but usually just blew them off, so I was prepared for what the controller I spoke with said, which was &#34;oh it ! was prob ably a helicopter or something.&#34; However, I knew it wasn&#39;t any kind of aircraft I&#39;d ever seen because of the incredible precision with which the lights moved and the total silence. I have told some friends and family about this, but I&#39;ve never reported it because I didn&#39;t know who to tell. Last night I heard the 21st century radio program where a gentleman told about his sighting in 1936 in Alaska. This inspired me to dig out an old journal where I had written about this. I got your website from the radio show and I decided to tell this story. I&#39;ve never had another experience like this, although I&#39;ve promised myself that if I ever was priveleged to have another I wouldn&#39;t panic and try to get away.<n>

We seen a object,  round in shape, about 6 to 8 feet in dynamiter (just bigger than the pitcher’s mound that it hovered over),   As I remember the object was no more than 4 to 6 ft. thick, no lights as I recall but a dull/shiny finish lol  The object hovered above a baseball diamond/pitcher’s mound..<n> <n><n> <n><n> I would say maybe 3 to 4 foot off of the ground..<n> <n><n> <n><n> The baseball field  was about 100 yards away from our location..<n> <n><n> <n><n> The field is there to this day and is still being used by the high school..  Not sure which one of us seen it first but I recall running to the far end of the house to hide and watch the object.. The baseball field is on the back side of the house,  At the time the lot behind the house was empty (no house on it)  with a street then the baseball field.  We observed this object for what I would guess to be about 3 to 5 mins  as it hovered in one spot over the pitcher’s mound. It did not make any noise of any kind and did not blow dust from the pitcher’s mound,  When it did move, it moved very slowly away from us or to the outfield and raised slowly as well until it cleared the tree line that was about 1000 to 1500 yards back  away from the pitcher’s mound,  Then we was unable to see it anymore.  When my Dad got home a short time later and I was telling him about it he laugh and told me to call the police and gave me the number,  So I called and told them as best as I could for my age,!  But hung up when they started asking questions lol (I was 6 yrs old) there may be a record of the call IDK.. That was 39 years ago and it has made such an impact on me that to this day I look for anything that comes close to what I saw.  I do fly on helicopter on a regular bases and that’s not what I saw and it was not a air plane.. So I just don’t know what it was..<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thanks for your time..<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date is approximate.  PD))<n>

My working partner awoke me (We were Military police taking a break in the woods at Smith Lake) &amp; pointed to this Light (a Ball that didn&#39;t emit light around it but was lit itself) and it just stayed in front of our Jeep.  It slowly came toward us so my partner cranked the Jeep up &amp; was backing up as it came toward us &amp; suddenly took off toward the left sky at an unbeleivable speed.  I say that because it was still seen in the far far left part of the horizon &amp; just dissapeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Our Radio was abuzz at this time with other units calling in about seeing UFO&#39;s.  A call came in over the radio for all units to return to the Station.  When all units returned (2 man unit patrols in Vehicles) we ware suprised to see the head of Military Police there. (it was the wee hour of the morning)  We were told :  Anyone disscuss, or talk about this night would receive an immediate &#34;article 15&#34; (punishment consisting of money taken &amp; possible confinment &amp; extra work).  We were dismissed &amp; returned to our patroling duties.  From that time to now, that has bothered me &amp; seeing something close to what I KNOW I &amp; someone  else saw...I&#39;m very very curious.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The last time I saw my partner was in Germany during the Kuwait Invasion. We are both retired Military.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date is approximate.  PD))<n>
