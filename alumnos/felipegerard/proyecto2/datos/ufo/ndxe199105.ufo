5/31/91 13:00|Marshall|MI|Disk|10-15 seconds|Very low-flying, metallic saucer-shaped craft with multi-colored panels by major Michigan roadway in daytime.|1/21/08|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/061/S61048.html|1|ndxe199105| Very low-flying, metallic saucer-shaped craft with multi-colored panels by major Michigan roadway in daytime.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This event occured late-spring/early summer of 1991.  I was about 11 years old and playing at my grandparents farm.  The sky I recall being perfect blue; not a single cloud in the sky.  Noise was at a minimum, save for the sounds of my own play.  There may have been intermittant automobile sounds before OR after the incident, but not during the 10-15 seconds the sighting occured.  This 100-acre farm is right beside a major roadway AND railsystem.  On the other side of the country &#34;block&#34; (approx. 1 mile north) lies I-94, the major Chicago-Detroit road system.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I was playing, I saw a glint in between leaves to the north.  I remember pausing, then looking back up.  I saw another &#34;metallic&#34; glint, but due to the leaves I could not make any shape nor size out.  There was no sound.  As I ran out from underneath the tree&#39;s canopy, I remember being scared for a second thinking that, as low as it was, it might be an airplane...but without a sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I emerged, I saw it.  Talking with my dad later that day about it to determine height/distance (remembering I was 11 years of age or so) we decided it must have been about 100-150 feet north of me; there is a cornfield that runs 100 feet north with a woods on the northern edge.  The object was somewhere above either corn field or just beyond and above the woods.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object was moving very slowly.  I would have to say no more than 15mph or so judging the distance it moved west to east (approx. 150 feet in 10 seconds).  I remember thinking I should hear a &#34;hum&#34; as I had been an avid viewer of the TV program &#34;Sightings&#34;; however, there was no sound or &#34;vibration&#34; whatsoever.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The &#34;metallic glint&#34; I first observed came from the top and bottom edges of this pie-shaped craft.  I could tell the edges were round, as in the center (which was the majority of the &#34;face&#34; of the side of the craft presented to me) had around 5 different colored &#34;panels&#34; standing vertically.  As a kid, it reminded me of the Lifesavers candy wrapper; each &#34;panel&#34; or window stood vertically, top and bottom of each panel meeting the metallic top and bottom of the craft.  Each panel was one solid color (I only recall three colors now; red, green, and purple).<n> <n><n> <n><n> The craft was not very high; being yound and unable to judge I cannot guess, but a separate &#34;incident&#34; I will relate in just a moment may allow you to judge the height.  However, it kept moving westward at an even pace, moving perfectly straight (not changing altitude or bearing).  Then, as if on a sudden, it shot off in another direction and altitude!  It headed about forty-five degrees to the north (roughly North East) AND UP in altitude at about the same angle.  This object, which appeared so low to the ground, was out of sight completely within 5 seconds.  Maybe less.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I stood there...obviously stunned...for only a few seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I cannot remember which I experienced next first, but I heard a helicopter just about the same time it too emerged!  This came from the west, heading east (same &#34;flight plan&#34; as the craft).  It was at about the same height as the craft but travelling faster (&#34;pre-spacejump&#34; I should say).  It was so low, in fact, that I could clearly see the spaces in between the letters on the helicopter: US ARMY After joining the National Guard a few years later, I was able to identify the helicopter.<n> <n><n> <n><n> One UH-60 &#34;Blackhawk&#34;.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It should also be noted that, about 30-miles due west, is a Michigan Air National Guard base that I would presume this came from.  Now I know the crew had to see it; it would have been right in front of them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I would also be surprised if no one else had seen this.  To reiterate: The day was clear.  The craft travelled between TWO major roadways.  The top and bottom caused such a glint that I noticed it while playing BETWEEN the leaves of a rather large tree.  The sides of the craft were quite beautiful, actually; each a separate distinct color.  It should have been noticed out of the corner of anyone&#39;s eye.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date is approximate.  PD))<n>

It appeared to be a hollow circle shape, with lines of electricity or something going from side to side across the blue outline. As it seemed to rapidly approach it turned a orangish color kind of like a fireball or something, all the sudden it was like looming over us, I like it was going to come crashing into us,<n> <n><n> <n><n> All I could do is just stand there, It happened so fast,as it approached it took an unbrella like shape made of flame above us, however I felt no heat, for a brief second I was afraid, I really couldn&#39;t believe what was happening, I stood entranced by the brillance of the colors of the flames. Then it just disapeared. I said to my friend ((name deleted)) what the @#%&amp; was that? He replied that he had never seen anything like it. Nobody ever really believed us, shortly after I moved back to Texas, lost contact with Tim.

It has been over 12 years now, but the experience is still so vivid for me.  I was on the deck at my parents house relaxing under a starlit light in their hot tub.  I was just sitting there, when suddenly the jets in the hot tub turned off.  I reached to turn them back on, when I looked up to see this huge...enormous shadow coming over the treeline.  It moved so slowly, yet so deliberately.....at about 2mph.  I stood up and stared straight at it...It sailed through the sky directly above our back yard without any kind of noise.  At the time I wasn&#39;t really afraid.  I watched as it filled most of the visible sky between the trees in the back yard.  There were bluish/whitish lights on the bottom of it, but they were not very bright.  As it left, the hot tub jets turned back on and I just sat there in disbelief.  I think that I wanted to believe that it was just some military experiment out of nearby Pease Airforce Base, so I really never talked about it to anyone other than family.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Last winter I found your site and was thrilled to see that other people have had similar encounters.  I am reporting this because it is still so clear in my mind and I believe that what I saw was not from this world.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
5/25/91 21:00|Lone Pine|CA|Light|60 Seconds|Mysterious Green Light following US-395 near Lone Pine|12/9/00|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/015/S15395.html|4|ndxe199105| Mysterious Green Light following US-395 near Lone Pine<n> <n><n> <n><n> My brother and I were heading towards the LA area from Mammoth Lakes, CA.  We were southbound on US-395.  It was approximately 9 PM and it was pitch black outside.  There are no lights at all in this area.  This area (Owens Valley) is a long N/S valley that is bordered on the E/W by mountain ranges in excess of 14,000 Ft.  As we were driving south of Lone Pine, my brother told me to look at a light that was to the left of the vehicle.  I looked and I saw a green light.  It was off to the east of the roadway by approximately 3 to 4 miles.  It was only about 400 to 500 feet off the ground.  It was moving at approximately 150 to 200 MPH.  It had apparently come from behind us, out of our view, and we noticed it as it passed us to the left.  We watched it as it continued south.  Since it was doing approximately 150 MPH faster than us, it gradually got further away until we couldn&#39;t see it anymore.  We expected to see it get higher as at the end of the valley, there was a ridge of foothills that it would have to climb over, but we never saw it again.  This light very well could have been an airplane as all airplanes have a green navigational light on the right wingtip.  But, there were no other lights other than the green one.  No flashing strobe lights or other lights indicative of an airplane.  Also, the green light was more like a luminescent &#34;glowing&#34; color, very different from the green color that is typically used on an aircraft.  Unless this was a military aircraft with night vision capabilities, there would have been no way for a pilot to see the terrain.  If you look on an aeronautical map, the section where we saw this &#34;light&#34; has mountains as high as 14,000 feet and it is pitch black out there with no ground lights to use for visual reference or dead reckoning.  Although we didn&#39;t stop the vehicle to listen for aircraft noise, we never did hear any noise.  If it was a military jet, even at 3 to 4 miles distant, we should have heard some jet noise.  The area in question is very near the China Lake! Naval W eapons Station.  During the daytime, I have seen plenty of fighter jets maneuvering in that area, however it was always during daylight hours and they were always up above 25,000 ft.<n>
5/20/91 21:00|Northfield|MN|Formation|8 minutes|7 UFOs flying in a train formation seen in Northfield MN, 1991|4/28/01|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/017/S17235.html|5|ndxe199105| 7 UFOs flying in a train formation seen in Northfield MN, 1991<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have created a Flash animation of this experience: http://www.((URL deleted))  In 1991 I was a senior at St. Olaf college in Northfield,MN. The following was witnessed by me, and at least 4 of my friends. The event occured in April or perhaps May of 1991. I was dark but it hadn&#39;t been dark very long. I&#39;d guess it was 9:00. A group of us were in my friends apartment (Lincoln Parkway apartments) when one of my friends called us out to the second story balcony of the apartment. &#34;hey guys check this out.. are these UFO&#39;s or something?&#34; We went out of the desk and there were several lights about 40-45 degrees above the horizon (from our perspective).. These lights were moving fairly slowly in our general direction.. as them moved closes they seemed to be following each other, one after the other.. I would call it a &#34;string&#34; of lights..there were 7 or maybe 8 of them. I&#39;m almost certain that these lights were moving independantly of each other and were not part of a single, huge object. The lights were a deep, amber red. I&#39;m fairly certain the red lights were on continually and were bright. In addition, each &#34;craft&#34; also had what I remember to be several strobes blinking in a repeating, irregular, odd pattern not like the once every 3 second strobes of an airplane. the repeating strobe pattern (of maybe seven individual blinks) that each craft had repeated I would guess every second or so. I got the impression that these lights were fairly close to us.. and the size of each was maybe the size of a small plane. (20 feet diameter each?) I didn&#39;t notice any sounds from these lights. I actually got the cordless phone and called my roomate (who was in my apartment in the next building) and told him to go out on the balcony and look at what we were seeing.. I asked him what he thought they were and he said &#34;I don&#39;t know, a train??&#34; which was obviously not the case because trains don&#39;t fly, and these things were definitely in the air. But the lights were &#34;train like&#34; with one following the other  blinking their weird lights.  The distance between these lights in this string was not far. They seems to be much closer together than what I would think to be a safe distance. A couple years later I noticed a formation of helicopters flying, one after the other, and I took note that the distance between the helicopters was much farther apart than the lights that we say. Actually, I do remember that the noise of a train going by on nearby track was audible at the time. this may have also been what caused my friend to give &#34;train&#34; as an explaination. If there were any sound of the craft, the train noise may have gotten in the way of us hearing anything). But had it been 6 Cesnas that close, I&#39;m certain I would have heard the engines. Still watching the lights, I called the police on the phone I was holding. the woman who answered said &#34;Oh, you know what those are? they&#39;re ultralight aircraft&#34;. This I doubted. I had seen ultralight aircraft in the area before. But never to my knowledge at night, and never flying in formation. The crazy blinking pattern of these lights was unlike anything I had seen on any airplane before.  Seeing one of these things would have been curious, but It&#39;s possible that I may have just dismissed it as a plane that had odd lights but I doubt it. These lights were weird, and there were 6 or seven of them! Interestingly, the police-woman I was talking to told me that in a neary by town (Fairbault) there had been a newspaper story of some UFO sightings a week or so previous to the night I was talking to her. (more about this later). The lights continued closer and closer to us and seemed to get lower. Slowly, the lights drifted past us to our left and from our perspective they disappeared along the tree line. After the initial string of lights disappeard to our left, 3-5 minutes past and then we looked up and saw another single craft appear in the some location in the sky that the initial group appeared. It moves slowly along, following the path that the other lights took. I seem to remember this one being slightly different. I believe it was smaller, but perhaps it wasn&#39;t. It had similar red lights and blinking strobes. The entire sighting lasted about 8 minutes. I later regretted not getting out of the building and going out in the field past the trees to see if I could continue to see the lights, but to be honest, I was scared.  The next day I called the Fairbault newspaper and asked about the article that had been printed. The reporter verified that he had in fact written an article that discussed a couple of sightings in that area. I believe he mentioned that someone had seen a strange light shining a beam down or something like that. He also mentioned that a local farmer farmer had apparantly also had a sighting around the same time as us. This farmer had had sightings in years past and even had experienced cattle mutilations. The reported took my name and we talked about him possibly writing a new story talking about our sightings, but I didn&#39;t pursue it and neither did he so nothing ever happened. I also called the FAA and not surprisingly they weren&#39;t helpful. The 1997 &#34;Phoenix Lights&#34; reminded me somewhat of what we saw, how the lights appeared in a row. But the lights in that video seemed white, not red, and didn&#39;t appear to be moving.  The lights we saw were much closer to each other (and to us) than the lights in the Phoenix videos that were widely shown. I know this report lacks certain important information (exact time, date) but I&#39;ve done the best I can. What I do know is that these were definitely, without question, intelligently controlled craft, not balls of light way off in the distance.  These lights were close and sharp and had it been daylight, I&#39;m certain I could describe the shape of these craft, but it was just dark enough that we could only see the lights of the craft, not the shape of the crafts they were attached to. If these craft were man made, they were unlike anything any of the five of us ever recall seeing before or since. This string of lights was moving roughly in an east to west path.

I had the feeling that this light beam was aroused the right over me. I thought so the UFO sends out this light. My first thought was not turn around, go on.<n> <n><n> <n><n> For a moment is enough for it I would want me turn light source UFO. However, noticed that is not good for me. I pushed my operations after that.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Was then incident, only a special refraction can generate this unusual light for me. One, two trees still were envisaged, the cone of light finally illuminated the way ahead of me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When this &#34;light&#34; then got more intensive and also acoustic signals were sent, I left the way out of fear and beat a bend to hold the direction further.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After approximately one kilometer I then came, onto these meadows on which the three tractors were in a distance from approx. three to four hundred meters with the aliens.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was clear to me, the signals should persuade me of the turning back.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Part from the report: I have watched the following event on 5-19-1991:  I watched a strange nature of another planet in the Champagne between Epernay and Dorman toward 1.00 hours at night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> You sat organized on three tractors distributed respectively with respect to sizes. On the first one per 8 of 1.60 m of size, on the second 8 of 1.80 m of size each and on the third tractor 8 extra-planetary living beings of 1.95 m of size each sat.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Ours is shape your body very much, very much! similar. Prominent distinctive marks are the lack of the earlobe and side of the nose as well as the reddish head and neck area. The hue of the other body came on violetly, blue, red and skin-colored. As similar as the colors of the rainbow.	  Particularly striking was, every group was different from the other group in the body form-great, thick, thin, corpulent. The organic appearance is stressed, shall be said the proportions of the individual parts of the body to each other were that way! even. With respect to sizes, form and weight these living beings looked just too &#34;natural&#34; so.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I left this place and went to the vineyards. A lamp suddenly came on there between the vines in 4 m of distance, otherwise I could recognize nothing. The light dazzled. I stopped and then moved further at the side. The &#34;lamp&#34; followed my movement. Hastily I turned round and wanted into contrary to a sedate direction make way. But another lamp was coming on in 10 m of distance at this moment.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I stopped, looked around and hurried toward the road lying below the vineyards. A gaseous cloud was rising of a near situated meadow at this moment – a sign gave a UFO to the aliens in this area by a laser beam. I marched down now direction road and the vineyard accelerated my operations in the direction of the Dorman.<n> <n><n> <n><n> An extra-planetary living being suddenly came at the side from the meadow goose-step-likely -no man can go so or imitate this movement rhythm, from the darkness toward the road and wanted to cut the way off for me. The body color was black like the night and I could do this only thanks to the moonlight. recognize well.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I ran as fast as I could and added a bend to some 100 m on the fields. A larger lamp in form of a heart also came on there between the fruit-trees. This one I ran to the river and direction Dorman got bright as fast as I could to it unflustered.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I was woke up about 430 Am to come along with my mother so she could drop my father off at work. In the car was my sister my cousin whom was spending the night with us that night and I. We took I-75 back home as usual because my father worked 15 min away from where we lived. While on the highway after you pass I-70 But befor you get to benchwood rd exit (note Benchwood rd exit was not there 10 yrs ago)I notiched an circular oval shaped object hovering around the highway ligts. The ufo was very close to us and I could not beleive my eyes. It continued to circul the lights in rapid movements. The ufo flashed with lights that circled around the whole center of the craft. They were multi colored I remeber it was blue and red colored lights. As we passed the craft I looked back and continued to watch it untill I could no longer see it. I asked my cousin if we really just seen a ufo and she replied yes in a creeped out way. What i belive the ufo was doing was getting energy from the lights on the highway to help power its craft. That is what I beleive. I live 10 min from the wright pat airforce base and I came up with a theroy that maybe its a top secert craft they created that can spy. I have allways told everyone about this encounter but never thought about reporting it till watching shows on ufos.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

I believe every word of it and my mother is honest and has no reason to lie to me. My mother was driving to work at about 6:00 o&#39;clock in the morning.  We live in a small town in the country, and off a few hundred feet from the road(a small country road) she saw several blue lights in a perfect circle on the ground.  The object was trapped by 3 helicopters and 2 more were coming in she said.  She did not want to stay because she was afraid the government would take her or something.  Where this occurred was about 150 miles from Diass Air Force Base in Abilene.  The reason why she is not telling you this is because she died 3 years ago.<n>

I grabbed my coffee and stood out on the deck of the machine to see better. There were two round lights connected together by an oval shaped light.These lights were much bigger than any star that was in the background so I assumed that it was fairly close or really big. The two round lights were what I would call irradecent.It was hard to nail down a specific color as it constantly seemed to faintly change color. The oval light was more like a pale white light, like from a dim flourecent light. I had shut off the engine of the machine and all was very quiet.After about five minutes of watching I observed the pale oval light that seperated the other two lights begin to get brighter. The lights then moved a good distance, angled upward in a straight line, stopped, moved down in a straight line,at an angle of about 100 degrees or so to the first line, and about the same distance and stopped again.It then took off again at an angle that intersected, roughly, with the original position so that a large triangle pattern was formed by it&#39;s movements.The lights were heading, in a northeast direction, into the horizon and faded into the distance within ten seconds or less.Also, like I said, all was quiet around me and not a sound was heard.I&#39;ve never seen anything like that before or since and this is the first time telling this story in this fashion.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

It was red at the beginning, but after a few minutes, it got brighter as it approached and resolved into a multicolored profusion of lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The event lasted about 5 minutes, and during the last 30 or so seconds, the collection of multicolored, randomly flashing lights stopped directly over my house, which was about a hundred feet from the garden.  It was dark, so I couldn&#39;t discern the shape of whatever it was, just a bunch of randomly flashing multicolored lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It appeared to be about 100 feet above the house, and if I had to guess based on the cluster of lights as an indicator of size, I would say that it was about 20 feet wide.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Anyway, as it stopped over my house, a spotlight shone down from it onto the house.  I must emphasize that it made no noise at all during the entire time, even when it was almost directly overhead.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When the spotlight appeared, I panicked and ran into the house.

I glanced out my window (to the right) and noticed lights flashing in the night sky. I asked my mom to pull off the road so we could see what the lights were. I opened my door and stood on the running board to get a good look at the lights. There were at least 20-30 square shaped white lights all in a row, and each one would light up one right after the other, and move from left to right and then move back from the right to left. My Mom, my cousin and I just stood outside the van and watched this object move right over top of us. It was moving at a speed approximately 5-10 km/h. The object had no other lights on it besides the ones flashing on the front of it. As the object flew over top of us, I noticed that it was round in shape. It cast a dark shadow against the starlit night sky. I also noticed there was absolutely no sound coming from the object as it flew over top. I live in a mountainous area, and this object was flying from the north part of the mountainous area, and moving southward to the open waters. I would estimate the object was flying about 100 feet above the trees. My Mom, cousin and I watched the object&#39;s shadow until it was no longer visible (due to the trees across the road). There were no lights behind the object, it was a dark shadow gliding through the night sky, not making a sound. As my Mom, cousin and I got back into the van, we all looked at eachother in disbelief to what we had just witnessed seeing. There is no other explanation in my opinion, except to say that we had just witnessed seeing a U.F.O. Approximately 8 years later, there was a write up in my local paper asking for people to come forward in regard to U.F.O. sightings in our area. I feel that we seem to live in silence with information such as this, but now I would like for my story to be shared with other&#39;s who may have found themself to be a disbeliever. I was a skeptic, now since the sighting, have come to believe in som! ething o ther then ourselves!<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date may be approximate.  PD))<n>

I had even called the Phoenix PD to ask if anyone else had seen this and the dispatcher said, &#34;I don&#39;t know what you saw but I&#39;ve been getting calls from all over the place.&#34; I was living at the Tampico apartment complex(6130 N. 7th. Steet) just a block north of 7th street and Bethany Home Road. It was Mother&#39;s day (May 11th) at approx. 10 or 10:30 pm. A glowing white sphere traveling from West to East crossed overhead moving rapidly and in a perfectly straight line and went out of sight quickly. I was on the Army Parachute Team in West Germany and have jumped out of allot of aircraft in my career. I know how to judge altitude and speed fairly well. This object was about 1500 to 2000 ft. up and absolutely silent. It did not project light in front of it (like running lights on an aircraft) it simply glowed white. There was a discussion on two talk shows the next day about the incident.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

I got off the schoolbus and started walking down my street toward home.  It was a clear afternoon, and I noticed an aircraft flying at a high altitude. It made barely any noise, but the sun was glinting off of it so it attracted my attention. It looked like an ordinary passenger jet, except that maybe the wings were a bit longer and thinner than I would have expected, but not by much.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I watched the aircraft as I was walking down the street.  Eventually I noticed a bright light, which changed in intensity a bit, but did not appear to have any noticeable shape.  It approached the aircraft at slight angle, coming up from behind it on what looked like an intercepting at a greater but steady velocity.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After about a minute, a small contrail curled off the opposite side of the aircraft, and travelling much faster than the craft itself, curled around the front of the aircraft and headeded toward the light.

(I am now 33 years old) My male companion and I were driving down an old country road, where we stopped off for a little car talk session, as we were having fun that night.  I turned of the car lights, but left the radio on.  Then the radio station started messing up and completely stopped.  I looked over at my friend, who at the time was approxiamately 17. I looked in front of the car and there was, what appeared to be a very bright street light about 100 feet in front of us.  I asked my friend if they had a new street light installed because it was bright.  He said no.  Then, I looked again, and the light had moved positions.  It was now hoving over a rural farm house that we had stopped by.  I asked him if the light had moved positions, and he laughed at me.  We both looked again, and it moved a third time.  This time it was hovering over a tree.  The house and tree looked bright as day.  The light was so bright that it was like putting a spot light right on them.  Only in a big way.  We both continued to watch the object as there was absolutely no sound, yet it moved.  I&#39;m not sure that whoever was flying the craft realized that we were in the car watching, but we didn&#39;t move.  We watched the object come closer and we started getting very scared.  It came very close and we got a very detailed description.  The object was a grey-metallic color, it was saucer shaped.  It had what appeared to be tiny windows in the middle of the saucer, going all the way around it.  The object just hovered there and then it happened.  They turned on the lights.  Oh what amazing lights.  They were almost irridescent in color.  Red, Yellow, green, blue.  I could almost see like a fuschia pink/purple color in there.  Like a christmas tree with flashing lights.  Only they flashed the lights so fast that I couldn&#39;t keep up with the color changes.  My friend was punching me in my leg and screaming to drive, but all I could do was put my face in the windsheild and! say, &#34;L ook at all the pretty colors.&#34;  Then I saw what seemed to be an almost transparent dome on the bottom of the saucer.  It was like a golden amber color.  I thought that maybe the bright lights were coming from that.  I mean the bright white light over the house and tree.  The dome wasn&#39;t very big at all.  Matter of fact, I would have never noticed it unless the thing was so close.  It was approximately 1 acre away, just hovering.  It was as close to me as my neighbors house is today.  I was completely mesmerized. Then, approximately 5 minutes after the last move and light show, it just stopped all lights and moved to the south as fast as it could.  It was gone in a flash, and I was shaken.   Of course, it was a very big ordeal and I told my parents about it immediately.  I stayed home from school for a while that week, as I was a senior in high school, and was very confused about the situation.  My friend had gone to school and when I went back, he had told people at school what we had seen.  I was embarrassed about it because I didn&#39;t want people knowing what we had seen.  I didn&#39;t want people to make fun of us about it or ask any questions.  Now that I&#39;m older, I&#39;ve learned to deal with this situation much better.  If anyone at the center has seen anything remotely close to what I&#39;ve encountered, please let me know.

We apprearently lost time and found ourselves on Road 117 remembering that we took road 53 when leaving I-40.  We got lost and ended up in Fence Lake NM the following morning where we had to wait for the country store to open to purchase fuel to finish our road trip.

I was around 8 yrs. of age and I shared a room with my older sister who was 15.   We were in our separate beds about to go to sleep when my sister said, “Oh my God!  What is that?”  She got out of her bed and ran to our window.  I was afraid to get out of bed, but my sister made me.  What we saw still gives me chill bumps when I think about it.  It was a UFO!  It looked like the cheesy UFOs that you see in those old science fiction movies.  It was disk shaped with many lights of different colors (yellow, orange, red)all around it.  It was hovering back and forth over the golf course, which our window faced.  My sister and I were frozen in fear.  It hovered for over a minute and then disappeared over the golf course.  We ran to our parents, who were still awake watching TV, and told them what we saw.  They were, of course, quite skeptical of their young daughters who came running to the! m raving about a UFO over the golf course.  Our dad went and checked outside and saw nothing.  Twenty years later and my sister and I still talk about it whenever we get together.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date may be approximate.  PD))<n>

I was in second grade and the planets were out my next door neighbor James had his telescope out.  We were trying to focus on the rings of Saturn.  It was a cool night, with a dark blue sky and along the horizon a orange line ran across.  I was at the end of James drive way with him, his sister Kerry was also with us.  The road we were on was North Virgina Ave.  It runs east to west.  We were in the middle of the block near Boundry ave.  So our gaze was to the left.  The 135 Seaford Oyster Bay express way is at the end of the block.  We could see the tree line from the express way.  Just above the tree line suddenly the object came going North to South.  It was moving very slowly, it did not stop and it did not pick up speed. From our view we see the houses on the north side of the ship, as well as the houses on the south side.  Trees as well on both sides.  Coming from out of nowhere out of these trees I am the first to see it.  I scream something a long the lines of &#34;Ah!&#34; or &#34;Oh!&#34; Kerry then said, &#34;What?&#34; She then looking up saw it and screamed very similar to me.  Next James said &#34;What?&#34; He sounded more annoyed at us both, then he saw it screamed as well.  Next James and Kerry ran into the house to get their mother.  I watched the object and when it finally crossed the street and was behind the trees and homes I ran inside next.  I was scared to move and I couldn&#39;t move till I could no longer see it.  I then ran inside and got my own mother, and both me and my mom came out to Kerry and James outside with their mom talking about what we just saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was in second grade, I was seven about to turn eight I believe.  My birthday being in June.  I only remember that I was in second grade.  I do not have the note book I wrote my experience in anymore or the picture I drew.  My mom told me that she had called Grummen and that they said it was a new plane to pick up the people in the Gulf who were at war.  This I found out many years later was false she did not call at all, she told me this so I would sleep at night.  Kerry was a year younger then me, and James was a year older.  I have not seen them since I moved in the fifth grade.  So I am not sure if they still live there.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The Object was just a light, and it was massive.  It wasn&#39;t one small light but huge.  It was a few inches in comparison to everything in the back drop.  So it was more then likely a hundred feet in length at the most I&#39;d say.  I am not a good judge of distance.  But if I were to close one eye and use my thumb I would say it would reach my knuckle from the tip.  It was along the tree line of the horizon.  It was hexagon in shape.  With in the hexagon were shapes, triangles and circles.  The triangles were coming from the top part pointing down, while the ones on the bottom pointed up.  They met in the middle and in the middle is where the circles were.  The whole shape was a bright light.  That was the most confusing part of the object noticing the shapes with in the light, each shape seemed to be it&#39;s own piece as well as it&#39;s own light.  As if each piece was luminescent on its own. Though I am much older now and I&#39;ve always wanted to report it, this memory is one of my most vivid.  I remember it so well because it is why I am a believer. Why no matter how much the subject scares me I watch programs, look up articles because I wish to know more.  And more then anything I wish to see the shape one day in a picture so I can show everyone I&#39;ve told that this is what I saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of the sighting is approximate.

It was a gloomy day in southern Cal. with low clouds and drizzle when in the mid afternoon I heard strange sounding thunder and lighting. I went outside amd thats when I saw &#34;it&#34;! I can&#39;t be exactly sure on the amount because it happened over 10 years ago but I believe there were &#34;9&#34; ,I saw nine glowing balls of light in the clouds. They were all in a gemomectric pattern equally spaced apart from each other. When a type of thunder sounded off these objects would begin to grow and get brighter. They also produced this strange loud electrical  sound like a buzzing that would keep getting louder untill one ball kind of exploded. When this happened the ball that exploded sent a lazer like line of electricity at one of the other nine,that one would then do the same with perhaps one opposite it .This continued in a pin ball like fashion as all balls got hit with this lazer thing. Everytime one would recieve it&#39;s hit it grew in size and brightness.The balls fired the lazers so fast back and forth at each other it was hard to follow. When the thunder stopped or slowed so did light showthough it would start the next series of &#34;zaps&#34; 30 seconds or more later.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They seemed to generate their own energy after the initial kick start from the clouds. These balls never moved and them being in the clouds I never saw any more then bright glowing round lights in the low clouds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I went inside our hotel and got my co-worker who was Chinese to see this for him self. On seeing the balls in the sky he ran back inside and tried to pull me in to. &#34;this is very bad you must get in&#34; I thought maybe he saw something like this in China so I asked him what it was but of course he had no idea.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have researched many UFO books and have well surfed the internet and have found only two sighting that were a bit similar though not the same.This was very hard to put on paper ,you must have been there to understand how strange yet powerfull it all seemed. A ufo fight? A dimention opening up? A star wars experiment(over a hotel?)

It was during the middle of the day.  I saw this object as well as my father.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was travelling in a pick-up truck west bound towards Escondido, California with my father in the spring of 1991.  We were going to install a motion light for my step-grandmother.  We were stopped at an intersection stop light.  An oblong bright blue (cigar shaped) object had appeared in the sky from what seemed out of nowhere.  It was stationary in the sky for perhaps less than a second and then accelerated and disappeared again it what seemed a split second.  When I saw the object appear in the sky, my first reaction was to point at it and comment on it to my father (he is a law enforcement officer)  But before I could even say a word the object had disappeared.  Both of us remained speechless.  After a minute or two I asked him if he had seen the object and what he thought it was.  We were both astonished and speechless which perhaps explains the initial silence.  We had both commented on the bizaar sight and suggested that it had been an UFO. I was quite suprised by my father&#39;s suggestion and acknowlegdement that it may have been an UFO.  We have never spoken a word to one another about it since that day. It just seems too awkward.  What we experienced was very unique. I am now 22 years old.  Born in 1975.  I am a college student considered intelligent ( to most).  I am neither a believer or a disbeliever of UFO&#39;s,  but I am open-minded to the possibility.<n>
