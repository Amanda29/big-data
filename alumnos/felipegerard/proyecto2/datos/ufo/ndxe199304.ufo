At approximately 1930 hours 8-10 amber lights appeared in a random, but close-knit order.  The lights stayed on for about 5-10 seconds and then went out.  About one minute later, the lights appeared again in a similar manner.  This happened repeatedly in one minute increments.  There was no sound associated with the lights. After a few minutes I called my 14 year old daughter to the balcony to observe the lights with me.  She observed the lights for approximately five minutes.  When the lights made their final appearance, they were completely aligned, as opposed to the random order of the previous sightings.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC NOTE:  Witness indicates that date of the sighting is approximate.

4/17/93 18:00|West of Rye|CO|Triangle|3 hours|Bright light in sky in Colorado 1993 revealed as triangular craft from photo analysis.|12/7/06|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/053/S53732.html|2|ndxe199304| Bright light in sky in Colorado 1993 revealed as triangular craft from photo analysis.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There were four of us...all male.  All of us have prior military service (Navy, Army (2), and Air Force) and are good observers--2 of us were officers).  We had traveled from Colorado Springs, Colorado to visit a work of art in progress (Bishop&#39;s Castle, a very cool hand-made structure all reader&#39;s must visit someday....) on a beautiful Saturday, April 17, 1993.  We drove a Jeef Cherokee to the castle, which is just west of Rye, Colorado off I-25, south of Pueblo taking CO-165 West.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We left the castle to find a 4-wheel drive trail to explore west of there.  We stopped at a large rock formation near a trail, when &#34;D&#34; yelled at the three of us to look at a strange light in the sky.  We were looking to the east/southeast at around 110 degrees or so. The sun was behind the mountains to our west and light was fading quickly.  The three of us looked at this &#39;star&#39; and didn&#39;t see anything, at first.  We actually told &#34;D&#34; he was hallucinating....this got him a bit mad at us.  We were going back to gathering wood for a fire, as it was getting chilly as the sun set.  After about 10 minutes, &#34;D&#34; again yelled at us to check out the light, which we all did.  And sure enough, we ALL saw this very bright, rapidly &#39;twinkling&#39; white light move incredibly fast to a secondary position in the sky....and then back to the original position, all within the blink of an eye!!  This was incredible....we all were quite amazed and spellbound.  The light continued to do these rapid linear displacements (equivalent distance of 2-3 times my thumb length while my arm is held out, base of thumb near the light....). I estimate the light to have been 10-15 miles away, but it was hard to tell as we had no minimal reference points.  There was a ridge in front of us to the east with plenty of pine trees, and the light was well past that.  It was at an angle of about 35 degrees from the horizontal plane from our position, again looking towards the easterly direction.  What was also pronounced was the rapid pulsing of the light! , which was the brightest object in the sky (stars were just beginning to appear as the sun set....around 1800 (MST) or so).  It seemed to have bursts of red and blue, but it just (at first) seemed like a bright, twinkling star. That is, until it shot off in different directions so fast, and then back to the same spot again1! It did this several times....we all saw it.  I finally recalled I had a camera with me, and as a plus I had brought a tripod!  So, I raced to the Jeep and got my camera setup with the longest lense setup I had available (2x teleconverter with a 80-200 zoom lense).  My only film (1 last roll....I&#39;d shot 4 or 5 of the castle!) was a 100asa 24 exposure roll of Kodak.  I loaded it and grabbed the tripod and headed up the hill!  My three friends stayed with the campfire below, continuing to observe the light as it bobbed and moved to various positions, but staying within the general area of just east of our position.  I got my camera setup, despite the steep angle on the hillside and had a pretty clear view of the light (from the campfire, it had been dipping below the treetops in front of us).  I used a cable to activate the shutter, as I did several long exposure shots. I decided on this strategy to capture a picture since the film speed was too slow for such low light exposure.  I had a couple of problems with the cable release, as 2 times it got stuck and allowed a regular high speed 1/1000 exposure.....wasted film, I figured.) After several hours of trying to get pictures, the light disappeared behind clouds that came up from the west. It was then we left the area, just around 2330 or so.  The next day, I took to the film I&#39;d shot to the 1 hour photo shop at the mall.  What I got  back was really not much, at first. Just a bright dot and lines.  But, 2 pictures were unusual. 1 looked like a &#39;tadpole&#39; with a bright head and a tail???  The other...well, I guess some would call it a &#39;1 in a million&#39; shot, and it is.  It clearly shows 3 separate and distinct lights, all at low level intensity. ! Connecti ng the lights are straight lines...it is definitely a triangular shaped craft!!  Now, what I must make clear....none of us (the four witnesses) ever saw a distinct shape, except for a round, bright light. This was quite profound to me, as this told me a LOT.  Whomever controlled this craft was intelligent....and using a camouflage method that sure seemed to work well. Secondly, the other timed exposure pictures revealed another fact:  whomever controlled the craft also was smart enough to use the stars as cover, moving the craft in perfect sidereal time!! It was emulating a star!! (the lengths of the lines created by the star movement = time. The bright light as well as observable background stars in the picture all have parallel light trails of equal lenght!).  This, to me, is a vital clue.  This was a very clever and effective cover....it sure worked on us! But, the camera does not lie....I have the picture (and negative...no digital pix here!). I had it blown up, and this is an amazing picture.)  In any case, we all agreed we had seen the same thing....but, the pictures told a very important story--that there was an intelligence operating whatever type of craft it was....not something I&#39;d ever seen before!  And it made no noise whatsoever.  This is my true story; I was reluctant in the past to tell anyone but close friends, but the picture still amazes those who see it.....maybe these facts will help other researchers.<n>

My brother came with me, we went around the back of the house. I grabed the ball, and we headed back inside. But I got this weird feeling to look up, so I look up and saw this china dish shaped thing. I noughed my brother and told him to look up. We look at it for about 2 or so mins. It was hovering over a Football field next to my house. It did not move much, but it went from left to right a few times, like it was checking something out. But then it headed out at a slow pace, I think it was to the South. While doing so it like became invisable. After that I did not see it again. Let me say that it was about 200 or so yards up in the air it was very visable.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

At the time of this sighting, myself and my partner were putting delineators in the road for a bike race or marathon the next day, I can&#39;t remember which. Anyway, I was driving the truck, and he was in the back dropping the delineators on the road. We were moving very slowly.Suddenly there was a bright blue flash, like the world&#39;s biggest flash bulb. My partner yelled &#34;Look!&#34;. At the same time I stopped the truck and got out. My partner was standing in the bed of the truck pointing at an object that I can only describe as a ring of blue fire, hollow in the middle, moving up very rapidly. It had a small vapor trail following it. Then it disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

We both lived on the same road and he drove me home, about 2 miles from my house we saw a strange sphere shaped object on the right side of the road above a security light its lights were so bright you could see them over the brightness of the security light, it had every color of the spectrum and the lights moved across the center of the object like a belt with a new color flashing every second. We stopped in the middle of the road and watched in amazement as it started to decend on the hill next to the road, it was rather large in appearence so it appeared to me that it was only 200 to 300 feet from the ground, we rounded the curve to get a better view only to discover that it had vanished.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

We were traveling about 55 MPH.  My nephew, an aeronautical engineer, was driving my car so I could watch for elk on the highway, being the spring of the year.<n> <n><n> <n><n> All of a sudden the highway in front of us lit up for a distance of approximately a quarter to half a mile in front of us.  The light was a very soft misty light and for some reason it didn&#39;t alarm us, it just appeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Being in the passanger seat, I bent up over the dashboard to see what was above us.  What I saw directly above our car was a huge soft, round light about 35-50 ft. in diameter.  As I looked closely, I could see greyish metal surrounding the light but could discern no definite shape.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then, looking directly ahead and just above the car, I counted seven of these round lights in a row down the highway.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I was peering directly up above the car, the ufo suddenly made an elegant curving motion just above our car and in a fraction of a second was gone.  As it made the turn, we could see the individual lights bending as the craft went skyward at thousands of miles per hour.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The next moment I could see it far off in the sky with the lights in a row but the object now looked about two inches long and then it disappeared.  The craft made no noise.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I asked my nephew not to discuss what we saw until we arrived home and wrote everything down, including drawings.  The only discrepancy between us was I thought the craft was about 100 ft. above the car and he thought it was only about 75 ft. above.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The next morning, we went to the local Pagosa Springs airport and spoke with the airport manager.  He said his neighbor  had seen a similar huge craft hovering over his house that night.   After having time to consider everything, we realized the ufo had to be traveling the same speed as our car as we were driving as it didn&#39;t seem to be moving at all.  The one end of the craft was directly above the car.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We reported it to the local Sheriff but he didn&#39;t seem interested and made no notes.<n>

I was walking home from Boy Scouts on a monday night when I saw an object above me.  It was about fifty feet over the tree tops.  For about three blocks the object was slightly  behind me.  As I turned right onto my street the object did not follow any longer.  No one except for me was on the street.  I then ran into my house.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Watching TV in my sun room I saw it again outside of the windows.  Then later, I went upstairs to my room to go to sleep.  I felt that something was outside so I pulled back my curtins.  The same object as before was about fifty feet above my neighbor&#39;s house across the street.  I then remember going to sleep.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The next day at school I asked the class if they had seen anything weird the night before. A couple of people said that they had seen a strange object.  These classmates were from my eastside neighborhood.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

I remember because it was the first day of the St. Mary&#39;s University Oyster bake, which kicks off Fiesta Week in San Antonio. My (ex)girlfriend and I had been near my parent&#39;s office.  She was with me while I was surveilling a claimant at an apartment complex off of Loop 410.  At the time, I was working as an investigator for the family business.  I worked on insurance cases:  worker&#39;s comp and auto liability. We had left the complex and were at my parent&#39;s office, which was nearby:  ((address deleted)) Executive Center.  We&#39;d planned for me to pickup a van there.  I&#39;d drive it over to my parents&#39; house and name deleted))(my girlfriend) would follow in my car.  While in the parking lot, we noticed a weird looking object in the sky west of us, in the direction of my parents&#39; place.  The object was silver-gray and metallic.  It was shaped like a conical disc seen in profile.  It seemed very big. We got into the vehicles after wondering about it briefly.  Since we were going in the same direction as the house (the house is about 1.5 miles from the office, &#34;as the crow flies&#34;, but about 2 miles away after all the twists in the road.) I decided to keep my eye on the &#34;thing.&#34;  So did ((name deleted)), as it turned out.  All the way home, the thing didn&#39;t seem to move.  That is, it seemed stationary.  And as we got closer to the house, we could see more of it, as if we were getting closer and closer to being under it.  The thing looked to be as high in the air as it was far away from the office.  At arms length, I&#39;d say it would be about the size of a silver dollar, maybe bigger. By the time we got to the house, we were underneath it.  Diane had parked behind me.  I got out of the car to look up at the &#34;thing&#34;.  I could see the underside, and there were structures there, but the underside seemed &#34;hazy&#34;.  Blurred.  And I had the odd feeling that I was forgetting what the underside looked like even while I was looking directly at it.  Weird. Now, the whole time I was driving home, I kept telling myself to stop, go to my car (which Diane was following me in) and grab my damn camera.  It&#39;s crazy, but for some reason I almost &#34;couldn&#39;t.&#34;  Very strange.  So, when we arrived at the house, I parked and ran back to my car.  Diane was staring up through the windshield at it.  I tried to get her attention, then looked back up and the thing was gone!  I was a little pissed!  Diane was still staring, at nothing now.  When I snapped her out of it, she said that after we parked the thing flashed a light &#34;at&#34; her and was gone. I never heard any more about it.  The house is at an intersection on a major boulevard (Wurzbach) and is very near the medical center. There were lots of other cars around, tooling along Wurzbach.  I expected to hear that someone else had seen the thing, but I never heard anything about it. Oh, when I mention &#34;haze or aura&#34; below, it only applies to the underside of the &#34;thing&#34;, which was otherwise clear and sharp. In my opinion, the thing was somewhat elegant in design.<n>

The smaller end of the light (point) was forward. At the rear (about the three-quarter point)and on top I observed a red rectangular light that extended beyond the tail end. From my vantage point the object appeared to be about the size of a golf ball. I percieved it to be at about the height (or lower) of a jetliner and it moved at about the speed of a fighter jet, but I could hear absolutely no engine noise. The sky was almost clear and in broad daylight, but even so, it was as bright as a sixty watt light bulb. There was no contrail behind it. It crossed my vision in a perfectly straight line and then made a sudden forty degree turn downward; not an arc but a perfect angle. At that point it disappeared behind a line of trees east of my position.<n>

It’s been 15 years since it occurred so I don’t remember the exact date, but, it was during the spring. I am from Pharr, Texas which is a border town in the Rio Grande Valley in Texas.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I was in high school I played in a rock-n-roll band. On occasion we would take trips up to Austin and San Antonio to watch rock bands or just sight-see. Our typical route took Highway 281 up north.  On this day we had completed about two-thirds of the trip. We had passed the town of Three Rivers and were about one-third the way from Three Rivers to San Antonio. Back then this tract of road was mostly woods with some ranches and other buildings sparsely populating the land.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I turned to look outside my window for no reason; I being on the passenger end of the car. I looked out above the tree line and there, clear as day, was the UFO.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The UFO was a perfect sphere, its surface appeared something liked polished aluminum and its diameter was approximately between 7-8 ft. At first I thought it might be a smudge or glare on the window because it appeared to be tracking our car perfectly, absolutely matching our speed perfectly. I adjusted my view several times to see if the image was on the window or whether it really was outside. The UFO was indeed real and flying above the tree line, apparently, tracking us. At this point, I have to admit, the realization that this thing was tracking us frightened me a bit. It’s very difficult to explain the emotions aroused by this kind of occurrence. It was quite alarming. I continued to watch this UFO for many minutes (at least 10 minutes) and then it suddenly occurred to me to tell my friend driving the car. I had been so caught up in the event I had completely ignored him.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I turned to tell him I realized he was already looking at it. He later told me that, after noticing my behavior, he had placed the car in cruise control and was switching between watching the road and watching the UFO. As I turned to once again look at the UFO it had disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Amazingly we were quiet for quite a few minutes before we began talking about. My friend, in particular was quite distressed about the event.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We never spoke about it again and I have only told a handful of people about it since.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Incidentally, a few years later, another UFO, this one a very large cigar shaped UFO was spotted, not very high in the sky, above my house by some relatives who are also neighbors. They ran to my house to tell me, they were almost to hysterics, but by the time we went outside the UFO had disappeared. Many UFOs were seen throughout the Rio Grande Valley that year. The local news referred to it as a UFO flap. That was the first time I heard that term.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have always wondered if the fact that two UFOs were seen around me was just coincidence or not. I have not been abducted or anything of the sort, in fact I don’t believe alien abductions actually occur, but I have to admit, a bit embarrassingly, that, ever so often , I look up to the sky, a little afraid, wondering if anything up there is watching me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.

We were traveling from Milwaukee south to Kenosha on a road running parallel and just east of I-94.  We first noticed what we thought was a plane flying very low with extremely bright lights flying directly at us.  The plane took a long time to reach us and eventually we pulled over to witness this flyby.  The three lights were so bright.   We pulled the car over and turned off the engine.  The craft was flying around 100 ft off the ground—amazing.  It was all-white, one winged, no windows, and had to be two stories thick but rounded with slightly swept back wings.  The most amazing part was it made no noise!  It looked like it weighed 300 tons, as big as a passenger jet but much thicker.  Moreover, it was flying no more than 15 mph.  I had a good long look at it 100 feet away.  It flew right along the west side of the road.  By far the most amazing thing I’ve ever seen.   I’ve told the story many times with a response most often of “hm.”  I have yet to look on the site but more people had to see this thing.  It was flying in the direction of the Mitchell airport, so I’ve always wondered if it landed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that date of the event is approximate.

4/1/93 06:00|Gastonia|NC|Formation|5 days|A triangle formation seen each morning before daybreak for five days off Bud Wilson Road.|5/24/99|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/006/S06425.html|15|ndxe199304| A triangle formation seen each morning before daybreak for five days off Bud Wilson Road.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I traveled Bub Wilson Road on the way to work from Saddlewood Subdivision toward Union Road every day. Each morning, before daybreak,  on the way to work I saw a triangle formation of three lights in the sky, west of Bud Wilson Road. Knowing that their is a small public airport in that direction, I did not think much of it the first morning. The formation looked as though an airplane had a nose light and two wing lights. The formation changed as though the airplane was making performing maneuvers(sp?. I thought it was odd though, because I lived around the airport for thirty years and know what to expect as far as how airplane sound and look. This aircraft had no sound and the lights seemed to stretch apart and contract further that a normal light formation  on any aircraft that I had ever seen. The next morning, I saw it again. This time I slowed down to get a better look. Once again, the formation was very odd and their was no sound. Their is a mojor International Airport aprox. 20 miles past the small public airport that I mentioned earlier, so I thought that perhaps I was witnessing landing trafic at that airport. But that did not turn out to be the case either. The third morning, I slowed down once again and studied the formation. The lights traveled in a triangle formation. The two trailing lights would stretch apart untill one of the trailing light would become the leading light and this would continue with the lights alternating. The road that I traveled goes South for aprox one mile, then curves to the west and goes about two and one half miles, like two sides of a rectangle. I could tell that the formation was confined to this area. Finally, on the forth morning, the aircraft decided to follow me along the road. It was not directly over me. I could look out the window and see it(the lights that is). Still no sound. Keep in mind that this is a very dark and quite area at 6:00 in the morning. Their are no buildings or traffic. Just a cattle farm on one side and some hunting land on the other. By the time I got to the end of Bud Wilson Road, it was no longer there. I lost it while tring to stay on the road. Then the fifth morning was the one that really onvenced me that this was no airplane or passenger jet. This morning, when I first spotted the formation, I pulled the truck over, rolled down the window, cut off the engine, and enjoyed the show. The formation appeared first to the west, over the trees. I watched the strange change of formations for a few minutes. Then the formation  came toward me. The change in formation did not always coraspond(sp?) with a change in direction. TIt came so close that it no longer appeared over trees, but directly in the sky above me. Finnally, the formation traveled south of me, became one light and suddenly flashed off toward the sky at the spped of light, never making a sound. Other than the lights, I never saw the craft itself. I have always been interested in such sitings since this event, but have only herd of one such sighting like my own since this happened.<n>
