Had red, white, and blue strobe lights on it.  Made a high pitched whine as it passed overhead.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At approximately 8:00 P.M. CST, I, my younger sister, and my dad were helping my grandmother to move into her new appartment by unloading the moving truck.  While we were out there, we heard a low rumbling sound which we took to be an air conditioner.  My sister went out of the moving van and said that there was something up in the sky.  We(my dad and I) came out to look and we saw and cigar-shaped object fly overhead.  It had come from the northeast and went southwest.  At the time it passed overhead, the rumbling we had heard changed into a high-pitched whine.  The object had 3 strobe lights on the bottom that blinked on and off; one was red, one was white, and one was blue.  It flew rapidly to the southwest until it was out of sight. I&#39;m not sure how big it was or at what altitude it was flying, but it looked to be very high up.<n>

I was looking up at the sky and saw four grey disc shaped objects flying rather slowly.  They were flying all around each other very closely.  Then they quickly lined up next to each other, hovered in the air for a few seconds, and took off so quickly they disappered from sight.<n>

I have tried to find a means of reporting, but always came up blank.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am a ranch supervisor and between Christmas and the New Year I was on a ranch in the state of , Cojedes. This afternoon in particular, I with two brothers in law plus two people from the ranch drove to the main entrance to the ranch to lock the main gate. The light was changing, going to dusk, driving back to the ranch centre, coming up alongside the air strip, we suddenly saw what first looked like a small plane coming out from behind hills to the left of the strip, with brilliant lights on.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was about 100 feet up in the air, at first I thought it was one of the owners coming to spend a few days on the ranch.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I very clearly remember seeing what appeared to be round windows within blazing lights. It was about the size of a Cessna two engine plane. I braked to a halt and we leaped out of the truck. As it passed within about 150-200 feet in front of us, I realized that there was no sound coming from it, not even the sound that one would assume that moving through the air would produce.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As it passed in front of us, the light around it was intense, and I also noticed that it was moving on a steady path, keeping level.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Coming through the hills it had managed to pass between two small hills that were definitely taller that the object in the air.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Passing in front of us, it seemed to explode in flames, again there was no sound. As it moved through the air, still keeping on a level plane, the flames were being pushed back around it by the force of air. It looked very similar to when one seeâ€™s a shuttle taking off to space.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It continued at its level as it drew away from us into the darkening night sky. We continued watching it and as it was approaching the far hills, it seperated into three pieces which were clearly on fire. At this stage the three separate pieces fell into heavy jungle that is in that area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This area at this time of the year is exceptionally full and very green; also because we are then coming out of the rainy season, the ground still had water and would have been quite soft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> To confirm what we actually saw, the following day, on the news, appeared a report of a pilot with a small plane that was passed by an object full of light, to which this pilot did an emergency landing as it frightened him. The object was travelling roughly north where it was spotted by several people at a village where the object then changed course to fly east, and then manoeuvred between the two hills to pass in front of us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.

12/28/96 01:00|Rockford|IL|Triangle|20 minutes|Black Triangle about 75 feet width.|9/2/05|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/045/S45069.html|10|ndxe199612| Black Triangle about 75 feet width.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On the night of December 28, 2005 I was sitting in the parking lot of Rockford College off East State Street in the College Security Vehicle.  At that time we had light bars, and spot lights on the vehicles as well as a programable police scanner to monitor activity near the college, or the response of emergency equipment when requested.  I had just finished updating my report and saw a low flying object approaching from the west with white flashig lights on the edges and a red flashing light.  At first I thought it might be a lifeline helicopter coming into land at Saint Anthoy Hospital to the east of the campus.  As I watched it approach, I realized it was flying perfectly level, extremely slow and about 100 - 200 feet off the ground.  When it came close enough to identify, I was surprised to see it was a very low profile black triangle shaped ship of some sort.  The ship paused and seemed to hover perfectly still over the campus above me.  I looked at it very closely for several minutes it just hung there without any sound or engine noise.  I notice on the bottom a cylinder type object - if you took the lid off a skippy peanut butter jar, and place it on the bottom of  a black triangle you would have the image I saw plus 3 white lights at the corner of the black triangle.  Every inch of it was pitch black in color.  Being excited, I aimed the spotlight in the direction of the craft and turned it on and my lightbar flashers.  The craft immediately changed from stationary to traveling at an extremely high speed beyond that of the speed of sound into a higher elevation and southern direction before disappearing.  I estimate the length of the craft was about 75 feet across and a perfect triangle shape.  Being an former Air Force Security Police Law Enforcement Specialist/Sgt - I have seen most if not all the current military aircraft.  I also have a relative to an inlaw who works on black projects, and it isn&#39;t one of theirs.. that he would let me know of.<n> <n><n> <n><n> If it had been he would have asked me not to talk about it, and I wouldn&#39;t have filed this report.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was a verybright white ball of light which shot straightdown much faster than i&#39;ve ever seen anythingshoot straight down.  I have no idea how largeit was, but would guess based on theintensity of the light that it was probablyno more than a mile or so away. It disapearedfrom view behind some trees to the west (probablyabout 25 degrees from the horizon where i wasstanding). I heard no sound during or after seeingit.  There was no flash or sound of an explosion,which I would have expected given its speed,trajectory, and apparent proximity when it disapearedfrom view.The sighting lasted no more than a second, but madean impression on me.  I never thought of reportingit until I ran across this web page.I hope it&#39;s useful.-((Name and e-mail address deleted))will only be active for another month or two.<n>

As I observed what I thought was an airliner of a type that doesn&#39;t have a broad wing that is sometimes not visually prominent from that altitude, I became aware that its speed did not seem consistent with an airliner as it eventually slowed, ceased forward motion, an maneuvered to 90 degrees from its original flight path, and became stationary directly above the mountain peak at the base of which is the German town of Mittenwald, in the Bavarian Alps close to Italy, Austria, and Switzerland.  Soon I noticed another identical craft approach the first from the original course of the first, coming to a stop parallel to the first, and remaining so for the time I was observing from the window of the train as I was awaiting it to begin the trip back to Munich. My brother and his wife were with me, although only my brother confirmed the phenomenon as he only had a window seat opposite from me.  This is  a very busy tourist destination, and the mountain over which the craft hovered has a cable tram to the top (8,000&#39;-10,000&#39;), where there is an observatory, and ski runs, so there had to be many other witnesses. As I think back, the sky was so clear that I feel it is very likely that I was observing very large craft maneuvering outside the Earth&#39;s atmosphere.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date of sighting may be approximate, although the witness does not indicate that fact.

Three round white lights (like small moons) in a fixed triangle configuration. They did not appear to be crafts. They turned together (around a central point between the three of them / not their own axis) one way (about half a turn clockwise) and then back again over some 6 or 7 seconds approx.  The three then moved quite quickly (a second or 2) to the centre to form the one (same size) circle of white light.  After a few moments it disappeared.  These were not moving across the sky and were crystal clear.  I do not know if there is any rational explanation for this and would welcome any input (on this website) from anybody who also saw this or knows what it was.<n>

I knew Isaw something, something that was not normalto our world. I looked down as I took a few more steps to the house trying to conviencemyself I had really seen something I stopped looked up and there it was, So dynamically and areobatically zipping through the sky,making high speed turns, slowing and speeding up with no effort then it began to come toward me, I&#39;m guessing it came within 2000-3000 ft.of me and just stopped Oh! the thoughts in my mind, you just wouldn&#39;t believe. I suddendly realized someone else needed to see this (iffor nothing else, for me -peace of mind thatI saw what I saw) I called to my wife, she couldn&#39;t hear me so I ran into the housecalling her and standing at the door fearingit would leave and no one else would see itit did start moving again before my wifeput something on her feet and got out to the front porch, but she had her opportunity to see the object in full motion just as Ihad seen it early. No noise no nothing, just lights, blurry lights.

My mom, dad, sister and I were driving down a road close to our house when I noticed an object pretty close to the ground. there were no sounds. eventually, we were practically under it and it was flying a little faster than it&#39;s slow speed.  It had 3 visible lights; one on each tip of the black triangular shape.  my sister got scared because i said it looked exactly like something i saw in a dream just a few days earlier.  When we got home(we were a street away) my dog was barking insanely.  I witnised the object one other time since then. I ob served it this time in my house.  I was at the computer a little while after Christmas this year(1999) when something told me to look out the window above the computer and i saw it again.  Both times it was close to the ground, silent, and always heading in the direction of south-east; toward my local air-port but both times, the air-port denies a craft such as that or any-craft coming from the direction of my house&#39;s area.  I think it might be the infamous Aroura Project but the government won&#39;t tell me if it exists and if it does, was it in my area.<n>

Overapproximately 2 seconds it grew into anapproximate 200-300 feet in diameter. At thatpoint it just seemed to explode into thesky. There was no visible body or mass. Andno sound.

I told my father to look up and sure enough he seen the same object I did.  My sister was only about 6 at the time, but she also seen it.  My mother was in the kitchen and saw us looking up so she did and she went to get a camera.  As we watched outside 5 airplanes started towards the craft in the sky and it shot off without a trace.  Of course the camera was to late, so we didn&#39;t get a piture.  We called about the 5 planes that tried to go after the object, the airport in the area said it hadn&#39;t had any flights take off in the last hour.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

We were arranged &#34;slumber-party&#34; style, with me and a friend in my bed, and two others on the floor in sleeping bags.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My bedroom is on the second floor.  My back was towards the large window, facing the expansive lawn of my rural home.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Suddenly one of my friends started shrieking, &#34;what the....!!!!&#34;  We all turned towards the window.  A pulsating, orangish-red light was shining into the window.  It wasn&#39;t exceedingly bright, however, it was exactly level with the second-story window.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I glanced back at my alarm clock for some reason, but there were no numerals displayed--the power was out.  The flashing light lasted for about 30 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were screaming the whole time (as teenage girls do) so I&#39;m not sure if any sound accompanied the light.  Unfortunately, as we were so frightened, we did not look out the window to locate the source of the light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Finally, my father,  awoken from his sleep with our screaming, came to my bedroom.  We recounted the story.  He insisted it had something to do with the transformer that lies at the far edge of the lawn.  He went outside to investigate, and found nothing amiss with the transformer.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After this sighting, my friends and I experienced a few other similar sightings over the next few weeks, cultimating in a sighting (also late at night) where the lights appeared to be coming from the side of the house.  This time, they were so bright that a light that turns off at sunrise outside my house turned off.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Although we didn&#39;t see an object, I feel that these lights are so unexplanable, as to constitute a UFO.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of sighting is approximate.

My sister, myself and my niece were out looking at local christmas decorations.  When we had left the house I noticed a Bright star in the sky, it being Christmas I naturally thought it was the north star, yet it seemed extremely bright.  I have been a star gazer all my life and the night sky was clear and this star was the brightest object in the sky, I couldn&#39;t help but keep watching it.  I had pointed it out to my sister and we kept looking for it has we drove around.  About 30-45 minutes into our trip the object was still in the sky, like a star, it hadn&#39;t appeared to move it was high in the sky like a star and stayed in this one spot the whole time.  Then I noticed what appeared to be a plane coming closer to the object, I made a joke that there was a plane checking out this star. There was just a tiny green light in the sky like the green lights on a plane, it appeared to be approaching the star, then there was a red light that appeared below the green light also like a plane, I commented again that there was a second plane checking it out.  Then the lights both the green and red light got brighter and then it became apparent that they were a part of this star.  They appeared to rotate like the object was turning sideways and we were seeing the bottom of it.  The green light the red light and the bright white light together formed a perfect triangle.  I was amazed and told my sister and niece to look.  It slowly rotated around and then it streaked across the sky, faster than anything I had ever seen.  Then to our surprise it suddenly stopped,  it was on the horizon just above the tree line.  It slowly moved across the night sky, now only the white light was visible.  Then it went dark, then dim, the a bright flash and the 3 lights appeared again,  we were dumfounded. Like it&#39;s going to show us again.  We had continued to drive the whole time, this object had never left our sight we decided to roll down the windows to see if we could hear anything, there was no sound! . At the speed this thing had moved we knew there would be a sonic boom, but there was nothing. Then the 3 lights that made the triangle appeared and it streaked off again, this time going out of sight.  I couldn&#39;t believe what I had just seen.  I felt really strange, knowing if I ever told this story I would be looked upon like I was crazy.  I have always been a believer in UFO&#39;s but to see one was unbelieveable even to myself.  If my sister and her daughter had not also seen it no one would have ever believed us.  Actually I don&#39;t think anyone believes us anyway. I am an avid watcher of UFO television specials, and until last night when I watched &#34;Lights over Illinois&#34; I had never seen anything that compared to what I had seen.  The object that they described in that show was so close to what I had seen I think it even convinced my husband that I had actually seen something.  The description that they gave sounded like me telling my story to my husband almost 5 years ago.  He himself was amazed at how their stories had sounded like mine.  This is the first time I have said anything about this other than to my closest friends and family.  We too, live near an Air Force Base, I have seen many a plane come and go from there, but this was no plane.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  NUFORC has either received, or learned of, reports of dramatic sightings in both the U.

They were not moving very fast, and they clearly were not any kind of conventional aircraft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The observer went outside to get a better look at the lights, which were solid--not blinking--but they were gone.  However, he noted a very prominent light &#34;at the head of Orion.&#34;  the light was red, yellowish, and gold, and it had the shape of an arrowhead, but the back side of the object was &#34;recessed a bit.&#34;<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then a second object joined the first!!  It looked like a small, white, flashing light.  Then both objects moved out over the Pacific Ocean.

12/18/96 22:00|The Woodlands|TX|Light|5 minutes|Saw bright orange light (size of Venus)  with diffuse and changing orange haze 1/2 size of moon around central light.|1/28/99|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/003/S03332.html|30|ndxe199612| Saw bright orange light (size of Venus)  with diffuse and changing orange haze 1/2 size of moon around central light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was in the kitchen of my house in The Woodlands, when an odd light in the sky caught my eye. The light was orange colored. I at first thought it might be a dim aircraft landing light. The location is within an approach area of Houston Intercontinental Airport (IAH). However, the direction which the light followed was not consistent with approach or departure paths for IAH. I looked at the light through the window and trees, and it seemed to be moving a little erratically as seen through the branches of the pine and hardwoods in the back yard. I grabbed my binoculars and headed outside. Again, the color and intensity of the light was unusual. the binoculars were handy for watching birds at the feeder. I went to a clear area just behind my house, and observed the light with binoculars and naked (I wear glasses) eye. The object continued moving from the East to a point nearly overhead, before changing direction to the North. The night was clear, cool (dry), and moonlit. The time just before 10:00 pm. I did not hear any sound related to the object. I could not estimate the distance to the object. It was not nearby, but could have been any height above, say, 5,000 feet on up to the edge of the atmosphere. I cannot estamte the speed of the object, except to say that it moved from Zenith to Horizon in about 3-4 minutes. The visual size of the central (bright) part of the object was like observing Venus. The color of the object was a golden orange, similar to a dimmed incandescant lamp, and similar to the orange sodium vapor lamps now in commom use for public lighting. The central part was not flashing, but there were some variations in the brightness. Although &#34;bright&#34; I would not characterize the light as &#34;intense&#34;. Around the center bright orange light, was a diffuse halo, or fog, of the same color as the central light, which would expand and contract, sometimes appearing to swirl around the central light. As the object was moving away from me, the intensity of the central light did not seem to diminish, as it would were it a lamp with reflector. There was no other light, nor shadow, nor detail observable with the object. It did seem difficult for me to keep a good focus on the object with either my eyes or the binoculars. The light approached from the East, till nearly overhead, then moved off toward the North, visible for perhaps five minutes before going behind trees to the north, and still visible through those trees until obscured by more dense growth and the northern horizon. This could give some indication of the altitude of the object; were it very high, it should become very small (due to distance) as it nearded the horizon, however, the size did not go very small. Consider a low-flying plane versus one crusing at 35,000 feet as it departs your area. This object appeared more like the low altitude craft as it reached my horizon, even though I could not estimate its height or distance while higher in the sky. The light moved slightly erattically in speed and direction. It did not make any dramatic changes in direction or speed, but did seem to wander around a bit. After I lost view of the object, I stood there contemplating what it was I maight have seen. I observed other aircraft approcahing and departing IAH. These craft were easily identifiable with the naked eye, red, green navigation lights, white beacons and landing lights, even lights on in the passenter cabin.  It was trivial to make out the outline (shadow) of the shape of overflying aircraft against the backdrop of stars and moonlit atmosphere. The orange object seen a minute before shared none of these traits. Every other questionable object I have ever seen in the sky finally resolved into something obviously of local origin... except this one. (end)<n>

I was going to bed at 0430 when I looked out the window at the sky. I saw what I tought to be a satellite or the space shutle slowly and steadily track across the sky from the south-east twards the north-west. I watched this object for a minute and than it stoped. I thought it was strage, but I sthat it might be a satellite that had moved itself into a geosynchronous orbit or possibly the space shutle that had done the same. Than it started to move strangely. It started to do little zig-zag patterns and move very slowly and rock back and forth. It also did a couple of 90 degree turns. I watched it for about 10 minutes, than I went and woke up my dad. He came and we watched it zig-zag and turn and start and stop and do spirals. The spirals seemed strange, to me, because it would start out with a big, slow circle and than the circle would began to tighten and it would speed up untill it had come to rest where it started. I think I can best desc!ribe the spirals as looking like a planet falling into the sun. All this time the sum of its movemets were bringing it twards the west (twards us). My window faces East. At one point I thought I saw a small light seperate from it and head South-West. It was so faint that I wouldent have thought anything of it except that my dad asked me if I saw it. My dad went back to bed about 0515 and by 0530 it was out of sight over my roof. I thought about going outside to watch it some more, but I thought it was too cold and I had watched it for an hour anyway, though I hope I didn&#39;t miss any big exit.;)<n>

The object was moving at an incredable rate of speed. Suddenly the comet tail went out and all you could see was the blue orb. When the UFO was over the road (still way to high to see detail) the tail&#34;fired&#34; twice, like some kind ofafte rburners.And was rocketed out of sight to the east ina matter of seconds, way faster than anything either of us had ever seen.

Looked up in the parking lot and observed a egg shaped clear yet irridecent &#34;bubble&#34;.  It moved slowly upward while at the same time &#34;vibrating&#34; as if something was spinning around inside the bubble causing it to wobble as if off balance.  It made no noise and was completely clear except for the appearance of a bubble... having multicolored yet clear walls. Stars could be seen through the object.  It moved from a SSE to a NNW location in the sky while slowly moving upward and quietly wobbling. When I began to observe it it was about 100 to 200 feet above me. Several people came out of the restraunt and saw me looking up so they took the time to watch with me.  We all talked about it while it happend and tried to determine what it was.  It was definitely not a balloon or any craft that I have ever seen before.  When the object obtained a height too high for us to observe it any longer we all talked about wether or not to report it.  All present decided not to report it to the local press or air traffic because we felt they would think we are crazy.  We all parted and went home to bed.<n>

Within 45 minutes we observed 2 fighter jets flying in tight wing formation going in the same direction as the UFO.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The ufo appeared to be a slightly flattened egg shape. It was a clear cloudless day, with only con trails from the airplanes in the sky. Sunlight glinted off the top and the bottom.  The object was heading toward was the Malibu, CA area.  The area where we were observing is comprised of hills and agricultral zones.  Because of the cooler temperature, all planes in the sky were leaving con trails, however the ufo did not.  I am unable to estimate how high, or how big the object was, although it did not appear to be all that high, or all that large.  The hill directly beneath the object when it stopped had sheep grazing at the time.  The speed the object moved was amazing, as were the complicated maneuvers it performed.  Approximately 45 minutes later we observed 2 fighter jets flying in close tight wing formation and heading in the direction the ufo had taken.  One of the gentlemen with me if familar with planes and fighter jets as his father was a lifer in the Air Force, and!he spent nearly all of his growing up years on AF bases.  One other interesting point, the ufo was going in the direction of Rockadyne, a company facility that builds and tests rocket engines.

My educational back ground is 2 years of college, and working in the Customer Service and Support field for 23 years.  I am interested in ufology, although I am not involved with any ufo groups.  There were 2 men beside myself who saw the ufo.  They are both in the sales field for our company, and other than the gentlemen with the AF background, I am not sure of the complete back ground of the men.<n>

My first time was after the sun would be down, i discovered that a lot of these things, i called them gods eyes, would appear right after the sun would come down and waiting minutes. I saw right up in the sky a boomarang shaped craft, it was silver colored and had a bright very blured light right in the middle outer part of the wings..Days later i would see the same one, and in others i would see perfectly two in a straight line flying together..There was no sound, and sense iam a only child, there was no one else...<n> <n><n> <n><n> One day, perfectly in my backyard, the family was hanging around in the night.

12/10/96 19:50|Gulf Breeze|FL|Sphere|15 minutes|Three super bright craft emitting triangular light array.|3/21/03|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/026/S26864.html|67|ndxe199612| Three super bright craft emitting triangular light array.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was driving with two friends across Bob Sikes (3-Mile) bridge going South from Pensacola to Gulf Breeze.  Halfway across, at the crest of the bridge, we were startled to notice an immensely bright light approximately 200 yards away from us at roughly eye level (about 100 ft. off the water).  It was disc shaped and was emitting pulses of light, much like tracer fire, in a triangular array of about 30 degrees, and only traveling perhaps 4 diameters out away from the craft before the pulses stopped.  The effect was visually as if a dotted triangle was temporarily attached to a brightly glowing sphere.  This emission would go on for 10-15 seconds at a time, after which, it would stop and then recur anywhere from 30 seconds to 2 minutes later.  I stopped immediately upon exiting the bridge and went to the edge of the bay to be able to watch with as little light pollution as possible.  When the lights were not emitting from the craft, it would fade to a dull, almost black, shade of red.  As it traveled East away from us, it would become difficutlt to track it visually while it was not in its&#39; bright phase.  When it was approximately 5 miles from us, we noticed another craft, also pulsing identical light emissions, approaching the first from about 45 degrees to the the North.  The two never got closer than a couple of miles from each other.  Approximately 10 minutes had gone by at this time.  Immediately after noticing the second craft, we noticed a third approaching the first from about about 30 degrees from the South.  At this point, the emissions were coming less frequently, and we could only be sure of the exact location of all three craft when they would emit, which they did not do in unison.  When they reached roughly the current location of the Garcon Point bridge (approximately 10 miles from our vantage point, they all three dissapeared at the same time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am a college graduate, do not drink or use drugs, and am an avid fisherman in the area, so I am very confidnent of my distance estimates.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  This report replaces a report NUFORC posted in 1997.

About 300 yards away hovering right over the trees in my back yard was a strange shape. it was a FAT tear drop , kind of like the space craft in independance day (I saw the movie 4 months LATER)It hovered for a while and I thought it was a helicopter at first , but I opened the door and I heard nothing.I have seen ALOT of helicopters even farther away and heard them.So I knew it was either a new , silent helicopter , or a UFO.Then , things started getting wierd , a strange blue aurora surrounded it and 2 lights , one red and one green , they went from opposite sides and hit each other , probably an antimatter reaction,then it sent out a beam and went into an orb formed by it. Finally it sped off in the orb so fast and at such a strange angle I was mezmorized.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness would have been in the second grade at the time of the sighting.  PD))<n>

Around Warrenton, or Jonesburg, Mo, we spotted a very bright white light above the highway. Just hoovering above an overpass about 1000&#39;. As we drove under it, I could make out 4 little triangles on the bottom. The object started to move after we passed. Latter on down the road, we seen a red (electronic eye as I call it) bobbing up and down going up the highway.   That about sums up that story. My family has seen NUMBERS of ufo&#39;s since 1950. My mother seen a disk in the middle of an intersection in Tx in 1950. She was almost blinded by the light. I&#39;ve seen so many, I don&#39;t have time to write it all down. I&#39;ve seen crop circles in our field, I&#39;ve seen ufo&#39;s more than once. No one can tell me that rocket boosters bob up and down and form formations in the sky! Hope this matches up with someone else&#39;s story. Thanks for listening.<n>

We were outside at the camp fire when wew first saw them. I got up to go to the bathroom and noticed the lights. They were small plain white lights, nothing multicolored. I told the other guys to checkit out. For approximately an hour, we watched these things dance across the sky in awkward patterns. The seemed at times to defy the laws of physics. One very prominent feature was their ability to accelerate at a very fast rate. When they did so, the craft expelled sparks (or what seemed to be sparks from a great distance). These craft could turn on a dime and sometimes seemed to stop. It almost appeared as if they were playing tag. At one point there were at least 5 flying across the sky. I am not an astrophysicist, but I am an Air Force brat, and I have seen every make and model of military and civilian aircraft fly. These things were not performing routine maneuvers. In fact, I don&#39;t know of any aircraft that can do the things that the craft were doing. The craft were pretty far from us on the horizon, I am guessing a few miles. I could tell that they were flying at speeds exceeding any mach level we have achieved. My buddies and I are fairly convinced that the craft we saw were either experimental government projects or something paranormal.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  A similar report was submitted by a group of hunters near Watkinsville, GA, on Saturday, 27NO99.
