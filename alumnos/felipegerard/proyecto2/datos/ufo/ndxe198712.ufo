Made sudden &amp;quot;L&amp;quot; shape turn unlike any known aircraft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The following incident occured in Exeter, Rhode Island on Route 102.  It was Christmas Eve 1987. I was 9 years old.  I was carrying presents out to the car at about 8 PM.  I looked up into the dark sky and saw a rectangular shaped UFO.  It had lights that were white, red and green. It appeared that in the white lit &#34;windows&#34; there were shadowy heads.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Things became more unusual when the object stopped while moving in a straight line and suddenly turned on a dime in an &#34;L&#34; shaped line.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Too frozen in awe to move until that point (seemed like I watched for up to 1 minute), I ran into the house to get my mother.  By the time she came out with me (a few seconds later) she and I caught the tail end of a flash as the object had quickly taken off.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Even though we both clearly recall the incident 26 years later, she was only able to see the tail end of the object and the flash.  This confirmed to her that I had infact seen something unusual.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  The witness will have his mother submit a report, as well.  PD))<n>

There was absolutely no sound whatsoever.  The object did not appear to be solid, rather it was transparent to our eyes and so we could not tell how high in the sky, but would guess around 1000&#39;.  There were pin points of red lights at what appeared to be joints of connections.  The object looked like toothpicks put together with nothing solid in-between.  Can&#39;t remember if the red lights blinked or not.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  One of two reports from same source.  Please see other report from Ocala, FL, for 24DE86.

We were driving a 24Ft. rental truck loaded with items for our employer&#39;s winter home.We were approximately 60-70 miles north-east of Las Vegas when we heard cargo in the rear of the truck shift. I pulled over to check the cargo and found everything secure. We all took this opportunity to stretch our legs and while facing away from the highway and looking in a southerly direction,I noticed six pairs of strobing red lights. They were located on a east-west plane and seemed to be evenly spaced. A large mountain stood in the distance andI later learned that it was Virgin Peak. What caught my attention readily was the very slow strob speed of the lights. I looked for other color patterns and none were visable. It is almost impossible for me to determine distance or height of objects, and no shape patterns were visable due to impending sunset.There was no noticable noise at the onset of sighting. After viewing objects for approximtely 2-3 minutes we noticed the sound of jet aircraft. Suddenly from a north-west direction two F-15 fighters flew over at a tremendous rate of speed. I would estimate that they were flying at approximately 500 feet and as they passed the ground reverberated with the sonic boom. We all watched in awe as the pairs of red strobbing lights moved tremendously fast to the east and suddenly in unison changed course to the south-east and raised altitude until they vanished. This all took place within a matter of seconds, and the pursuing fighters had no chance what so ever to catch these objects. This was truly a hair-raising experience for all of us and we did not waste any time in exiting the area.<n>

Because the family was from Winnipeg Manitoba Canada, we were staying in Tampa|2/14/08|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/061/S61434.html|5|ndxe198712| My family were visiting disney world Christmas of 1987.  Because the family was from Winnipeg Manitoba Canada, we were staying in Tampa Bay Florida for half the duration of our trip (2 weeks)to Florida.  The other week was to be spent at bush gardens at a different hotel.  The hotel we were staying at was called the The Sonyesta.  On or around the night of 19 Dec 1987 we decided to visit a restaurant called King Henry&#39;s Feast in Miami.  We left the hotel in Tampa at around 16:00 on the 19th and drove to Miami.  The King Henry&#39;s Feast was a Medieval style dinner and show and the whole affair lasted many hours so by the time we left Miami to go back to our hotel in Tampa bay it was quite late, around 0:00.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At around 1:00 am we were on a deserted stretch of highway near - as far as I can remember- swampy country with scattered palm trees.  Because it was somewhat dark I can only remember seeing flat ground with telltale plantlife that indicated swamp such as sparsh high grass, rushes and bumpy, in some places, reflective ground indicating stagnant water in addition to the dark outlines of palm trees.  I remember that the moon was full when we left Miami but at 1:00 on the highway it became foggy.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My memory becomes hazy at this point, but I recall other cars stopped by the road and people looking at something in the sky.  I recall the other passengers in the car gasp and say &#34;oh look!&#34;.  I recall seeing three other people besides the passengers in our car.  The other peoples cars seemed to have headlights on.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The passengers of our car consisted of 4 people.  Firstly myself age 7.  I was at that age an avid camper with my parents and that is how I knew what swamp looked like.  I am now 28 and a Captain in the PPCLI, a Canadian Infantry unit and I have seen action in Afghanistan.  My father is a doctor who practiced at the St James Clinic and Misecordia hospital in Winnipeg, Manitoba Canada.  My Mother was or was studying at the time, to take her bar exam.  She has been called to the bar in Winnipeg and British Columbia Canada.  She no longer practices law but is a stay at home Mom for my younger siblings who were not yet born at the time.  The final passenger was my Dad&#39;s mother and my grandma who is now deceased but at the time worked at a clothing store for senior citizens in Winnipeg.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My Father and Mother were in the front 2 seats of the car and my Grandmother and me in the back.  As we approached what I remember to be one or two cars pulled over at the side of the road with people beside them I perceived 6 light blue glowing lights rotating in the sky.  Each was the size of a quarter in my memory, but only because they were some distance away.  I seem to recall we got out of the car at this point to look at the lights but I have another memory of staying in the car the whole time.  The lights did nothing but rotate, in my memory at an angle and down towards our car.  The whole scene-like a picture- was us, bottom right ground, road bottom middle, other people and cars bottom left.  Mid right was shadow of palm trees, mid center was fog but flat bumpy ground, mid right was fog, top right fog, top center fog with some traces of moonlight seeping through and top right were the six blue lights rotating at an angle facing us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I do not recall how long we lingered watching the lights but at some point during this time I recall glancing out of curiosity at the other people near our car and to our left to see if they were as amazed as us.  I recall a man with shaved head and glasses in a white shirt looking calmly back at me with an amused expression.  I have conlicting memories of this man; one memory that he was in another car and I saw him through a window and another memory that he was outside the cars to my left at about 9 feet away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At this point I draw a blank and do not recall if the lights disappeared or we just got bored and decided to leave.  We got back to Tampa Bay and had no other encounters since.  After returning to Canada at the end of the vacation we did not discuss at all afterwards memories of the vacation.  Anytime I brought up the issue of the lights my mother scolded me, dismissed the event or made fun of me so I soon let the matter drop.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Upon remembering this event last year in September 2007, I questioned my father and mother at a restaurant and it took them by surprise.  I said simpley &#34;do you remember the 6 blue rotating lights in Florida?&#34;  My father remarked off hand (and without any prompting from me) that there were lots of people watchig the event.  My mother then remarked that she had no memory of other people there.  We were all 3 of us discussing the event further in the car and my mother became very agitated and angry while my father seemed very curious and trying to remember more, or so it seemed to me.  My Mother did give me a detail I had not remembered-my Grandmother had decided to purchase communion which was a book about alien abduction.  My Mother told me all this nonsense about UFOs was due to my Grandmother scaring me.  I do not recall ever discussing the event with my Grandmother at all.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Please let me know if anyone has had a similar experience.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.

While we were observing the stars we saw a single red light lasting about 10 seconds.  After a minute of staring in the same area, we saw a commercial airliner going south to north and all of a sudden 2 red lights showed up.  In perspective, the lights were as large as the commercial jet.  With my hand extended, they looked to be about 12 inches apart (from our vantage point).  I am not sure how far away from us they were as it was night time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They stayed in one position horizontally for about 10 seconds, then the southern one went up and the northern one went down, slowly at first, then quickly.  They both then disappeared and we didn&#39;t see any additional lights over the next hour or so.  The one that went upward seemed to moved extremely rapidly the other not so fast.  We were both in disbelief and asked each other if that just happened.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I searched an have not found any similar incidents online.  We were just merely out camping and saw these lights.
