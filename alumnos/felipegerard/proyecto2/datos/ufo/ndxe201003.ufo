As I got to my foyer I looked out my front door and saw what I appeared to be an airplane with its landing lights on. I watched it for about 30 seconds and at that point told myself that this did not appear to be an airplane due to how the lights looked now. So I decided to get my jacket on and just step outside for a momement. Now looking at this object I knew by seeing the lights moving across it and what appeared to be some kind of red laser type of light on the bottom, that looked like it was hanging quite someway away from the lights on top, that this was something that I have never seen before. I observed this for approx. 45 min. At times the lights appeared to be in a cross shape but most of the time it was just straight across with the red light on the bottom. This red light appeared to be going in a circular motion and just not oneway, in some kind of scanning mot! ion back and forth. The light that appeared from this object was white and sometimes blue lights running through the white. There were times that both ends of the light were lit up in blue also. I know this seems crazy but I truly know what I saw and maybe there is an answer. I don&#39;t know but I thought I would at least document this sighting with the first hit I got on the internet.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Five lights in bright orange appearing in straight line, then 4 across horizontal, later they formed a triangle with just 3 lights...my wife witnessed them also.  The blogs were full of sightings at the same time...I pegged the site to be around Cottonwood, TX in Callahan County...I made this judgement call by reading other blogs, pulling out maps and pin pointing where I thought they were.  I am familiar with flares, afterburners, landing lights, etc... I live around Dyess Air Force Base and know nearly every military aircraft.  These lights were something I cannot explain...<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I thought maybe I can follow it with my eyes so I looked and sure enough I could see a craft moving at incredible speed. By the size of the airplanes that fly over, I estimate it to be bigger than a house and smaller than a school auditorium. The best way I can describe its flight pattern was a lot like A stunt kite. It moved in from high up almost straight above me from NE to SE but it got bigger doing so.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object then began to move evasively like a stunt kite from East to West looking much bigger as it passed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was the color of a faint star but as big as a silver dollar at arms length.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Which is huge looking in the sky The light eminating from it was lightly visible but visible none the less.<n> <n><n> <n><n> (I am stone cold sober always.) As I watched it, I became terrified. I felt something was different about this one. This blurry glowing blob moved at incredible speed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It made no sound. I live a few miles away from the airport but that is some 4 miles to the South from me and all planes land behind me and are much much closer to the ground.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This object was straight up 12:00.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Flying obviously by something guiding it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Every thing that flies over is a small dot. An airplane. But this was huge.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am a Quality Control Manager Trained by Boeing. I have seen alot of airplanes in my life and this was no earthly known craft to me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I sat there blinking in disbelief at first but after going over all know Planes and copters as well as military craft, I knew that this was extremely odd or off the charts for other worldly craft in comparison.<n> <n><n> <n><n> the way it zig zagged,at a high mach speed. (This was not a flying triangle.) It was a much larger indistinct shape.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have seen strange things in the sky before but this time I am going to do something about it by reporting it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thank you for help.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Sincerely, anonymous.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
3/31/10 20:00|Annandale|NJ|Light|5 min|star like light that moved and changed directions in hunterdon county, NJ|4/13/10|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/074/S74858.html|4|ndxe201003| star like light that moved and changed directions in hunterdon county, NJ<n> <n><n> <n><n> last night march 31,2010 around 9pm, me and my friends wife went outside to walk their dog, and as soon as we walked out the front door i looked up and seen a light really high up in the sky.  It look like it was just as far as the stars and also looked like a star, but then it started to move slowly to the south for about a minute and then it just stopped and just hovered for about another min then it started to move south again for about 30 seconds, then it just totally changed direction and then was moving to the north at a very high speed for about 20 or 30 seconds, and then i just lost it and couldnt spot it anymore so then me and my friends wife went back inside... then about 10min later i went out my friends back door into the back yard and looked to the north where i last seen the star like light then i spotted it again for about 20 seconds then it was gone.<n>
3/31/10 20:00|Glen Rose|TX|Light|10 minutes|Orange orbs west of Glen Rose|4/13/10|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/074/S74885.html|5|ndxe201003| Orange orbs west of Glen Rose<n> <n><n> <n><n> Heading west on hwy 67, in Glen Rose, I saw 2 lights west of town.  The sun had set but the sky was still light.  They would turn on, then off.  The one on the left (south) would glow orange, then the other one on the right would turn on, so to speak, and glow orange.  They would dim to red and then both would turn off.  This occurred 3 times with a duration of maybe 5-10 seconds.  Both lights appeared stationary.  I got to the top of chalk mountain and pulled over at the picnic area where I got out and looked for 5 minutes and never saw them.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
3/31/10 20:00|New Kensington|PA|Other|5-10 minutes|Disappearing plane.|4/13/10|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/074/S74854.html|6|ndxe201003| Disappearing plane.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was traveling south on Route 28 at approx. 10 minutes to 8PM.  I exited at the Tarentum exit.  At the stop sign at the bottom of the ramp I looked to the right about 45 degrees.  Out of the front windshield just above the tree line I saw some whispy clouds.  They were orangish colored from the setting sun.  In front of the clouds coming over the trees heading due north was a very distinct chemtrail that was also orangish. (Sun reflection)  I have always been a sky watcher.  Especially since becoming aware of the chemtrails.  I&#39;m the type of person that notices things others wouldn&#39;t.  I don&#39;t drink or use drugs.  I consider myself a credible witness.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had to make sure I stopped because there was a cop car to my right watching the stop sign.  I noticed I was having trouble focusing on the chemtrail.  Normally they start as two trails coming from the wings and they quickly blend into one wide trail.  This one appeared to blink from one to two tightly side by side.  Everytime I blinked it was one then two tightly together.  At that time I could not see the plane making the trail which seemed odd.  I made a mental note about where is the plane.  It was time to move so I drove on making a left turn towards New Kensington.  This placed my back to the trail.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Having to wait for the lights to change it took a few minutes to cross the bridge. My destination was at the end of the bridge.  I pulled in to the parking lot and headed to the back lot.  This again placed me facing the direction of the chemtrail.  I was looking to my left at a 45 degree angle.  It was still orange, thick and very defined.  Now I could see the plane.  It was sorta shaped like the U2 spy plane.  Very odd looking and black.  Normally the planes are white.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thinking back now about where I first saw the trails and their angle in the sky and now looking at them again something seems not right.  It&#39;s like they jumped over toward the east closer to my location but were still heading north.  I parked and got out.  I was watching the plane and couldn&#39;t wait for it to come toward my location.  It&#39;s present heading would have put it directly in front of me moving from left to right.  I really wanted a better look at the plane.  The trail it left was very thick and was not evaporating like a (vapor) contrail.  I knew this trail would last and I wanted to see how it spread out.  I went inside so I could unlock the door from the inside.  This took 1-2 minutes.  I came back out with great anticipation figuring the plane would be just about directly in front of my line of sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I opened the door and stepped outside and the plane had  vanished.  The chemtrail was completely gone as was the plane.  I looked in front of the path the plane was on...nothing.  No evidence of the thick chemtrail it left behind. Everything was completely gone.  No cloudlike formations and no plane.  The plane with the speed it was traveling would have easily been somewhere in my field of vision without turning my head.  The thick chemtrail from my many previous observations would have lasted hours and spread across a wide area of sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I saw the trail after entering the parking lot it looked like the chemtrail started a few inches behind the plane like it may have just been switched on, again a little odd considering the time it took to cross the bridge.  I should have been able to see it stretch way out behind the plane.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Remember the trail blinking and changing from one to two?  And the trail seemingly shifting positions to the east?  No plane visible in front of the trail and then it was.  The plane was not as high as they usually fly.  At first I thought it was very high and that&#39;s why I didn&#39;t see it.  When it did appear it was big and much lower than they normally fly.  And looked black.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There is no way the plane changed direction.  I would have been able to see it make any turn.  From that vantage point you can basically see horizon to horizon.  It literally vanished into thin air without a trace like someone flicked a switch.  I think it may have been jumping locations in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Reporting a UFO is one thing.  The government can dish out a swamp gas cover story.  Reporting disappearing planes puts it in a different ballgame.  I&#39;m afraid I&#39;ll get a visit from someone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> How did they make the chemtrail instantly invisible too?  Stealth on steroids?  Cloaking?  Keep looking up.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.  PD))<n>

I witnessed them for 15 mi, followed them until I found a park on bangs rd across from the hobby store.  They are remote controlled aircraft with lights on them.  I almost had a heart attack when I was right under them until I realized it was 2 truck loads of people just enjoying a hobby.  They fly them there and I also see them in ripon ca off jacktone in the soccer field by the gigantic water tower with the soccer ball print painted on the top.  It&#39;s kinda a bummer, I know.  Sorry.<n>

We were standing outside of our dorm with a clear view of the sky.  We saw something which we thought was shining in the sky and looked to be just a shooting star or something.  After about half way through our cigarette we noticed it again and that it was bigger and brighter then it was a few moments ago when we first lit our cigarette.  It was very bright at this point, unfortunately i could not tell how far it was. I started to look closer and the tip of the cone shaped object was flashing repeatedly about every half second.  We watched it for about twenty to thirty minutes in astonishment thinking we just saw an actual UFO.  Then it faded off into the distance after hovering for about thirty to forty minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date is approximate.  PD))<n>

My husband and I witnessed it changing colors and flashing bright neon orange, pink, and green.  Several times a red flashing dot flew off to the side of it and then back to the main light again.  At 11:30 two other flashing dots appeared but disappeared shortly after.  The first dot remained in the sky for over an hour and continuously moved up and down and side to side at a very fast speed.  When it began to move I called my mother, my brother, my sister in law and brother in law, all of whom were able to see it as all even though they were over 40 miles away.  While talking on the phone we were able to observe it moving at the same time in the same direction.  Throughout the duration that it was viable it continued to flash very brightly in red, blue and green.<n>

My boyfriend had come to pick me up from my house at 21:00 so I could stay the night with him.  We proceeded to watch television for one hour before we proceeded to go to his house which is the neighboring town.  We drove down from the top of my hill until we were in front of our local high school.  In the sky above the high school was gold looking light that we at first had thought was the North Star.   We first ignored the light until we noticed it was slowly moving closer to the Earth.  At this point we were freaking out because we thought it would make a crash collision with our little town.  I personally along with my boyfriend could not take our eyes away from this strange light that kept getting brighter.  My boyfriend and I first looked at it thinking it was in the shape of a body then with closer examination of staring at it longer I noticed i! t had bright rings around it.  The light eventually stopped in mid air and began moving back father into the sky in a right aimed direction and eventually vanished.  My boyfriend and I being skeptics can still not rap our mind around anything but the light had to be a UFO.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The light pollution isn’t too awful so I am able to enjoy (simple) stargazing without going out into the country. Tonight I was on my balcony viewing the Moon through my binoculars and noticed what I thought to be a low flying plane coming from the south. My balcony faces the southeast. I focused my binoculars on it and noticed there were no flashing strobe lights that I’ve seen on other aircraft. Because the Moon is so bright tonight, and as the craft moved toward the north and nearly overhead, I was able to make out a triangle shape. It had, at first, 3 lights underneath on each corner.  As it came closer, I noticed a fainter light in the center (underneath) of the craft. The lights were white. It was flying north. No sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Almost expected to see a plane crash as the light was so bright, however there was no sound.  I saw it threw the window. Ran to the door and there was nothing in the yard, nothing in the sky.  The light appeared approximately 60-70 feet off of ground.  Moved from southwest to northeast over neighborhood.  Clear night, full moon in the East.   A friend saw a similar light moving from the north to the south over the local beach several nights ago at nearly the same time of night.  Blue/green close to the ground – moved quickly and disappeared.  We are one who typicall believe in UFO, however there must be something going on.   Left with an strange feeling, not knowing what this is -- twice in one week.  This is the first time we have visited your site, needed to know if anyone else has seen this light.<n>

As I contunued to watch the object travel towards the East I noticed it splitting into two objects. One object headed North and the other kept traveling towards the East. I was able to watch both objects for a couple of minutes until they disapeared into the night. The weather was clear and breezey with a slight haze covering the sky. The objects were identical - both round and reddish - moving fast and erratically.

We live in the downtown area and were looking west towards the mountains.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My fiancé pointed out a dim orange light very high in the sky.  The light then split into about 7 or 8 orbs and started to travel north, north east.  There was no sound and they were traveling much faster than planes.  (Which we see all the time).  They traveled across the entire sky and started to separate and finaly dissapeared into the sky. The whole event happened in about 10 seconds, there was no time to get a camera.  If I didn’t see it myself, I would have never believed her.<n> <n><n> <n><n> With that being said, I have another sighting to report on her behalf.  Two months ago at about 6:30am, she saw something flying in the dimly lit sky that resembled a pterodactyl.   Yes I am aware that they are extinct!  So of course I had a hard time believing her.  She said it was the size of a small plane and it was flying at a relatively low altitude.  It looked as if it were carrying a large animal by its legs.  An animal the size of a bear or cow.  She said she saw it for about 6-8 seconds and then it disappeared.  We are baffled as to what it could be.  And in case you were wondering.  ..we don’t use drugs.<n>
3/29/10 20:21|Oro Valley|AZ|Formation|2 minutes|Three pulsating lights scene around Tucson AZ|4/13/10|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/074/S74827.html|23|ndxe201003| Three pulsating lights scene around Tucson AZ<n> <n><n> <n><n> My cousins and I stepped out side at 8:20 PM in Oro Valley (which is about a 45 minute drive north of Tucson) AZ just to look at planets. It was partially hazy but almost completely clear around Mt. Lemon of the Santa Catalina Range north of the city. As soon as we stepped out of the house I heard a high pitched screech coming from the south (from Tucson). It was fairly high pitched but sounded like a commercial airliner. The aircraft(s) were in the haze traveling north. Since it was loud (so most likely low) and traveling in a heading not a major population center I will assume that they were A-10 Warthogs hailing from Davis Monthon Airforce base in Tucson (they have exposed turbofan jet engines and sound similar to commercial aircraft). I only saw on faint pair of lights and they were flying west by northwest and probably at low altitude.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As the noise subsided, I looked towards Mt. Lemon and noticed ONE bright pulsating light coming from the northeast. It was brightly pulsating and at high altitude, pulsating at random intervals (sometimes many times in a second and sometimes one every two or three seconds). When it pulsated it appeared that their were green and red lights (one of each) in addition to many very small white lights on the sides of the objects. I am sure  that this was not an airplane as the red and green lights (like those on the sides of airplanes to indicate their port and starboard sides) as they were not constant and the white lights were not a planes landing lights as they were not constant or pulsating in constant time. Although it was hazy in most of the sky, the sky around Mt. Lemon and the rest of the Santa Catalina mountains was clear as the moon and numerous stars were visible  while only the brightest stars were visible in the rest of the sky. The craft appeared to spawn, as it sudd! enly appeared next to a star that I was viewing to the northeast. The craft travelled very quickly as it was able to transverse the entire mountain range in the course of about two minutes. As it progressed its strobing light gained in intensity. Although I can not say for sure, I would speculate that it flew at high altitude and was far to the north, most likely directly over Globe AZ. After about 30 seconds or so, a second identical object appeared behind and closer to the horizon, in relation to the first object. They were in constant formation and had a tethered appearance to it. The objects were definitely not satellites (as I&#39;ve heard of old tethered satellites) as they were very bright (brighter than the surrounding stars). Right before I went in the house to get the whole family to see (as only three other people were witnessing it) a third light appeared. The object was identical to the others but was far in front of the other two and was at an altitude (or locatio! n as I can&#39;t really speculate on its hight) in between that of! the oth er objects. The objects combined form a V shape or that of an isosceles triangle with a very small angle made between the first two objects and the third one in front. When I came back out with the rest of the family about one minute later the objects and any traces of them were gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I usually scan the skies at night out of habit. I turned around to face south as my front door to my house faces north.  I noticed a light traveling north East.  It was a steady glow that at first sight appeared like a star.  I paused to focus better to make sure I was not looking at a plane since LAX is in the same direction, South.  I ran inside to grab my camera. When I returned I lost sight of where it went.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About five minutes went by and I spotted it again.  This time it was traveling North West. Same speed but very high up. I ran inside to call my 2 kids and my wife.  Again, I returned to lose it again in the night sky. I asked my kids to stay with me as we scanned the sky.  We then spotted it again but this time it was traveling due east.  In the distance we followed it closely as to not lose it.  It kept its course east and disappeared.  We then looked straight up and saw the same kind of light traveling due north east.  This light disappeared the same way as the one traveling due east.  We spotted what seemed to be 3-4 or these lights at different times. Maybe 20 -30 seconds apart.  When each one disappeared a new light would appear.  This went on for a good ten minutes.  My kids witnessed this strange light that really appeared to be a star.<n>

About 10 minutes before we cross over into Oklahoma, I see a huge ORB that would be the size of the moon at 3:30 in the afternoon.  I have my glasses on, so I can see perfect and for about 11 seconds, I see this ORB like it is going from cloud to cloud not to be seen.  This day we had one layer of clouds and above that another layer and that is where it was located.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Huge round all white and a little whiter than the white clouds around it there and perfect round.  Could not see the debth of it just a front view.  I could also see chrystal clear like flares in a few spots on the side two places of the ORB.  Mistic swirling kind of look inside of it. No noise at all.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So traveling north to south and the clouds going south to North somewhat and on my right a full sun in the west and the ORB traveling west to east, what a site that was...<n> <n><n> <n><n> Size:  you could put about 60 to 75  jets that are that size about 10,000 feet where most chem trails are done.<n>

The group of light moved from southwest to west direction.  The UFOs moved quickly and faded away towards Santa Monica, CA.  The group of lights were as if there there a bunch of bolloons were let go in the sky except that these lights were bright and moved fast from southwest to west in the sky.<n>

Saw a fiery-orange globe move in a straight line in a south westerly direction.   The angle was about 45 degrees across my line of sight.  I was facing west. The globe was followed about 30-45 seconds later by another moving along the same track and then 30-45 seconds later a third followed also on the same track.  It was hard to judge the speed, size and height.  The globes appeared to be about 200ft off the ground.  The speed seemed slow, but as they went further away the speed appeared to increase.  If anything I would have guessed they were small, hot-air lanterns being blown along.  However the movement was very deliberate and all three globes moved in exactly the same way, without deviation.  There was not much wind about but a check of the meteorological report for the area indicates prevailing winds in a North Easterly direction. Two other people, out walking dogs saw and discussed the objects! with me.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

At first, I thought it was an aircraft as we frequently have planes fly over our house. However, the light moved slightly both vertically and horizontally, but did not appear to be moving closer or further away from us. I then thought it must be a helicopter but when we got out our telescope, it completely disappeared. After about 30 seconds it reappeared in the exact same place - as if the light turned off and back on. It started lowering towards the ground and we eventually lost sight of it. From our house, it was towards the Waianae area of Oahu.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It&#39;s footage of a dragster racing at 236 MPH.  As fast as that is, that isn&#39;t the interesting thing about this video.  What is interesting is at the end of the video is what appears to be a UFO flying very fast (perhaps faster than the human eye can see)into the upper right hand side of the frame.  I didn&#39;t notice this until a few months ago when I was reviewing this footage. If you slow it down you can see what appears to be some kind of glowing thrust.  It&#39;s at the end of the video about 28 seconds into it. Had I noticed this at the time I took the footage   I would&#39;ve kept the camera rolling. Please let me know what you think.  I apologize for the F-bomb that I made just before the footage end.  It was aimed at just how fast this car was going and not at the UFO that I didn&#39;t know was there until now.  I&#39;m also sorry that the advertisements pop in ju! st about at the very end and make it so that you can&#39;t view the very end.  I don&#39;t know how to fix it so that doesn&#39;t happen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I sent video footage..not sure if you will be able to view however because I&#39;m not very good at using the video editor.  I just trimmed the video down to the last few seconds but for some reason I don&#39;t know how to save it in a format I can e-mail and have the receiver view it. here&#39;s the your tube version:<n> <n><n> <n><n> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhi98ew0rLk<n>

Then we noticed more and more on the left and right side along the highway just above the tree tops with red and white lights. At each corner of the trianlge was a bright white light.  In the front of one these hovering objects was one bright headlight.  This is why we thought it was a helicoptor at first but with the moon over top of one we soon realized they are not helicopters.  These objects moved very slowly and hovered with no noise at all.  We saw 13 all together for about the next 8 miles.  After seeing a few of them I saw a sign off the northbound side of the highway that read something about aerospace/military development or something close to that.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

There has to be a rational explanation for this sighting.  I&#39;m sure there is.  And I&#39;m really curious to identify it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;m in Valencia, CA.  After midnight on March 27, 2010, I came upstairs and immediately noticed a blue light (like a huge glowing LED) emanating from outside the large window in the baby&#39;s room.  Looking outside, I could clearly see three rows of brilliant blue lights hovering low to the ground over the mountains -- perhaps a mile away.  I had an eerie sensation seeing this unidentified object, as I had never seen anything like it before.  The mountains are free of houses or any man-made structures, so it was completely out of place and very prominent.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I immediately ran to grab my Sony Cyber-shot.  After taking a few pictures, I tried to take a video, but it was not very clear.  So I ran downstairs and got my Panasonic DVX-100 and started filming with that.  The video doesn&#39;t begin to do it justice, but at least it&#39;s something.  You can see a blue-lit object just hovering there.  From what I could make out, there were 3 rows of brilliant blue lights and one pulsating red light at the top in the middle.  (You hear me describe this on the video.)  There appeared to be slight movement or rotation, but I can&#39;t say that with any certainty.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After the camera battery ran out, I watched the object for a few more minutes and then went back downstairs and tried to convince myself that there was a rational explanation.  I came up fifteen minutes later and the object was still there.  Went to bed soon after, so I&#39;m not sure how much longer it stuck around.  Kicking myself for not continuing to watch, but quite frankly, I couldn&#39;t quite believe what I was seeing.  It was only the following morning when I reviewed the footage that it really began to sink in.<n> <n><n> <n><n> To be certain, I recorded video out the window at the same time the following two nights, but no lights appeared.  I searched around online to see if anyone else reported a similar sighting.  It looks like there were two other reports on or around March 27 -- one in Tracy, CA and one in Blue Lake, CA.  Specifically, I believe both of those reports also cited the pulsating red light atop blue lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have both video and pictures of the object.  Happy to upload or provide original footage if it&#39;s helpful.  Would appreciate any info.<n>

These lights were seen west of San Jose, towards the Pennisula and the Bay. We see many planes and helicopters in this area so we know how they appear in the sky; these lights were much more brilliant - both were as bright as a rising Venus at certain times of the year. I could not detect any sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As they dropped below our sight, they kept the same vertical alignment, same distance apart, and moved at the same rate of speech.

It did not look like an airplane as it did not move, and there were no strobes. It was very bright (almost had a haze like apperance around it), and stayed stationary and then vanished after about five minutes. While it was visible, I asked my Fiance to come out and look. She saw it and wondered what it was. I can not be sure what it was, but I do know it was bright, did not move, and then vanished. There was no sound from where I was viewing it from. I have looked in this direction numerous times before, and have never noticed anything. The appeared to have some slight color variations in it, but not a whole lot. It would fade every once in a while (but not go completely out) and come back very bright. All in all it lasted about 5-8 minutes total, the whole time not moving at all (had lined i! t up with a branch on neighbors tree). Will be checking on and off through out the night tonight, and will look again around the same time tomorrow to be sure it was not a satellite or a planet/star, which I really believe it was neither.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
3/26/10 17:20|San Francisco|CA|Unknown|30 Seconds?|Small white dot flying through sky in San Francisco|4/13/10|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/074/S74806.html|43|ndxe201003| Small white dot flying through sky in San Francisco<n> <n><n> <n><n> A friend and I were at Dolores Park in San Francisco yesterday.  The incident occurred somewhere between 5:15 pm and 5:25 pm.  It was a sunny day with a bright blue sky. It was cloudless.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were laying on our backs looking up at the sky.  I noticed a pigeon sitting on top of a lamp post that was in the park.  I noticed a small white object floating down to the earth.  I thought the object was a feather that had fallen from the bird.  For some reason, I was fixated on it and watched it float to the ground.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I told my friend to look at the feather and pointed out that it was taking a really long time to hit the ground.  All of a sudden (and I know this sounds strange,) the &#34;feather&#34; went up higher in the air instead of coming down.   At first I thought a gust of wind blew it higher.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then, all of a sudden it appeared to shoot through the sky up and over to the right above some houses.  The way it was traveling did not seem plausible by Science.  It shot FAST across the sky as if the sky was sucking it in.  Like it was traveling through another dimension.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I don&#39;t know if it was actually a feather that we noticed which drew our attention to the small white object or if the feather transformed into the white object.  But it flew SO fast and high and eventually disappeared.  As it got further away it looked less and less like a feather and more like a tiny white dot that was glowing. Like a shooting start that went up instead of down.  I hope this made sense.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I looked around to see if anyone else in the park was noticing it but no one was.  My friend that was with me saw the exact same thing.  I had him describe to me in detail what he witnessed to make sure I wasn&#39;t seeing things.  He described it accurately.<n>

We saw something floating over the Pacific and moving towards the coast. It seemed to be coming from the west, heading slightly south east--perhaps toward Torrey Pines.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It did not have the symmetrical shape of a hot air balloon, nor did it seem like a parasail craft. It was about 1/4 the &#34;size of a full moon.&#34; It looked to be dark blue, perhaps with some “cardboard brown” coloring—and no discernable markings. It had a cobbled-together appearance and if I was told it was a home-made craft, designed out of about a hundred card board boxes, and filled with helium I would think that was a viable possibility. There were no lights and no sounds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It appeared to be moving “about as fast as a hot air balloon” and did not appear to be under power.  As we finished our walk we kept an eye on it, and at one point it looked to be changing direction, heading more north-east. It seemed to be gaining altitude. Back at the house we found the binoculars but were unable to get a good focus on it.  My mother who was visiting from out of state tried the binoculars, too, but with no real success--it was too far away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Finally it changed direction again, and appeared to be heading more distinctly south east, toward the Miramar Marine Corps Air Station. Concerned that it might tangle with the flight pattern of the F-18’s that fly out of Miramar regularly, we called the San Diego County Sheriff’s Department, letting them know what we saw. While I was on the phone the object moved out of our sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As for the background of the three witnesses—all of us are college-educated, two of us with graduate and post-graduate work as well.  My mother and I both are from Air Force families, with knowledge of aviation and aircraft.<n>

It was approximately 6:45 AM just before the sun had come up and I had been looking up at the stars.  I looked away for a second and when I looked back I saw one of the stars moving.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It looked like a bright star and it just slowly moved across the sky.  No sound or craft was detectable but I imagine the object was very far away.  It took about 60 minutes  ((sic.  Seconds??))  for it to cross the sky.  Enough time for me to wake my girlfriend and have her come out and see it as well.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It is possible this was just a satellite and that it wasn&#39;t actually stationary but rather came into view when I was looking away and just happened to crossed the path of the stars.  There was no blinking or coloration and it was definitely not a plane.  A satellite is a possibility though I have never seen one before.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I just thought I&#39;d report it here in case anyone else saw it or had any information as to whether or not this sounds like a satellite.<n>

It caught my attention because it was orange, where usual helicopters have a white glow.  I stared at it for a few seconds and then it started dropping smaller white lights, and my first reaction was that it was dropping bombs.  I didn;t think it was a UFO at this point, I thought it was an army helicopter or other army aircraft.  I left my room to go get my mom;s camera and returned with her and the camera only to find that the mysterious orange light was gone.  I looked throughout all the windows in the house, it was nowhere in sight.  I thought about it and brushed it off as a helicopter dropping flares because it was the only logical explanation I could come up with.  This was at approximately midnight on March 27, 2010.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About an hour later, I woke up and my window was still open.  It was then I saw that the smaller crafts that were dropped were all clustered and flying around in unusual patterns in the North West sky out of my window.  I looked at them for four hours and couldn&#39;t figure it out.  I&#39;m positive that they were what came out of the orange glowing craft.  They would fly diagonally, horizontally, vertically, and make turns that couldn&#39;t possibly be made by any aircraft here on Earth.  I seen them appear from point A to point B.  There was no trace of light as they flew because it was so fast.  They, like the orange UFO, were silent.  I watched them from 1:00 AM to about 5:00 AM then I thought I had enough and shut the blinds and tried to sleep.  I didn&#39;t see when, or if, they left, but I did hear a loud and unusually low jet fly by a little before sunset that woke me up.  I checked, and didn&#39;t see them anymore after that.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The orange UFO was high in the open sky, and the white smaller ones were unusually lower than the mountain range that is outside my window.  Both the crafts looked like simple circular lights.  It was an extremely windy night so the sky was clear.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I don&#39;t see how I could be the only one to see this, I&#39;m sure others seen it as well.  It lasted for hours.  My moms camera and my phone couldn&#39;t focus on the objects, so no pictures came out that would show anything.<n>

It appeared suddenly in the night sky, however it soon dissapeared after about 2-3 seconds. Almost 90% sure it wasn’t a shooting star since I have witnessed many shooting stars in my life.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Approximately 5-10 minutes later, another aircraft very brighty at slow speeds appeared very closely to where I saw the first sighting. The second aircraft however was a very bright light and had one other flashing white light beside it. No other colors could be seen besides the white light flashing beside it. Could what I have seen been two UFO’s? Or, could the second aircraft be pinned onto a registered aircraft? No shape could be reconized due the the fact it was very dark.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

There was no sound from it at all, and it moved at a steady pace not fast. We were completely taken aback by it we couldn&#39;t believe what we were seeing!<n>
3/25/10 21:00|South Bend|IN|Unknown|3 minutes|Object travelling in night sky below cloud deck eastbound illuminated (flashing & steady) green, red, white & shimmering violet light.|4/13/10|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/074/S74789.html|51|ndxe201003| Object travelling in night sky below cloud deck eastbound illuminated (flashing &amp; steady) green, red, white &amp; shimmering violet light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This object was observed while driving in residential area north of the University of Notre Dame. Weather was overcast and object was below the cloud deck. What at first appeared (and was assumed to be) a very large commercial aircraft took on a very different appearance upon closer inspection.<n> <n><n> <n><n> An impressive display of flashing lights is what caught my eye. Green and red lights similar to standard aviation craft were seen...however these were arrayed in larger numbers, particularly the red lights. A deep fluorescent violet light began to shimmer at one point along at least one edge of the object. As the object passed more overhead I could then see the bottom of it. On this aspect I could see a large bank of white lights (these were not bright white but had a somewhat warmer and yellow/orange tone) in a rectangular pattern. These somewhat shimmered and sparkled.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object was traveling due east at a steady but undetermined speed. My guess was that it was traveling at approximately 300 to 600 MPH (depending on the actual height of it).<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object appeared to be quite large in that as it got further away, it did not really seem to diminish in size too much. On the other hand, it was below the cloud deck (the altitude of which I do not know), so sizing the object in that regard was not possible. I was driving alone and simply could not pull over in traffic to get a better look. There was a solid black background slightly visible behind these lights...so it was almost assuredly a solid structure that I was looking at.<n> <n><n> <n><n> If I had to guess, my general impression was that the object had a somewhat triangular shape. The size of the object by pure general impression, would have been approximately the size 1 to 4 times the size of a Boeing 747. I lost sight of the object behind trees.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The type of lights on the object were shimmering (violet), flashing (red and green), steady (red and green) as well as the steady yellow white rectangular lights which had a shimmering to sparkling aspect to them as well. The object, while in my view, did not behave any differently than that of an aircraft except that I have never seen an aircraft which was lit up in this spectacular fashion.  Very interesting. I found your site after wondering if I could locate a similar type of sighting.<n>

We had seen some lights like this once before in this same area but this time I grabbed my camera.  I couldn&#39;t seem to get the craft to show up in my view screen on my small digital camera.  I asked my husband to pull over and he did get some better shots.  In the video you can stop on frames 1:16, 1:18, 1:27, 1:28 and 1:39 to see the shapes of the crafts.

I have a story for you.  It was so huge and headed west to east about 20 minutes before we hit the Oklahoma border.  We were coming home from Nebraska off on vacation.  It was real windy that day and we had two layers of clouds one close and the other was where this was traveling.   Looked like the moon shape and whiter than the whitest cloud around.  It was so big you could fill it with the size of our jets at the chem trail distance.  It was moving like it was darting in and out of the clouds not to be seen but within 45 sec I caught it a few times by itself.  In the middle of the day sun was to the west clouds coming from south to north and it was moving west to east.  During the day ???  I know what I saw.  The depth was not seen just a straight on shot.  I could describe this better on the phone<n>

At first we just thought of it as an airplane or a shooting star but when we saw another one go in the opposite direction we payed close attention to them and then we saw the two lights appear out of no where and they just were sitting there and not moving but they were glowing and we all just were stuck thinking in our heads of what these lights could be. Then we looked at each other in &#34;aw&#34; and we were just flabbergasted.  After about 3 minutes the light just flew across the sky again in the same direction but it seemed like as the both melted together and disappeared into the dark night sky.  All three of us after that just started talking about what it could be and everyday we try to figure out what it was.<n>

If you hold a large marble to to the horizon that&#39;s the size. This was to the East, I turned all directions to see if anything else in the sky looked like this light. I also saw an amber light directly to the west of this east light. I concentrated on the larger amber light in the eastern sky. It seemed stationary to me, then started moving to the south. As this light was moving south I still saw amber in the front, blue, yellow (as we know it..other variation of amber to me). Colors were flashing on outside of craft. Flashing not at bottom, could tell it wasn&#39;t at the bottom. But threw the middle of the craft. I then could no longer see it due to trees.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.  PD))<n>

I was facing south when I stepped through the door and turned to the east to reach for the pack of cigarettes setting on the table. As I was lighting the cigarette I noticed a light in the sky, about a mile away and about a 1,000 feet in the air.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first glimpse, I thought it was an airplane headed for Sky Harbor, which is about 20 miles to the west of us. My first thought was that it was coming in awfully low. Then a second light appeared and I wondered where this second plane had come from. I had not seen it approach. A moment later, it occurred to me that they were not planes, the color of the lights was wrong. Instead of being white, they were a soft yellowish amber, similar to the street lights around us ( the street lights were not on at this time).<n> <n><n> <n><n> By the time this thought cleared my mind a third light appeared. Then a forth and a fifth. Though they were aligned in a line, it was not a straight line.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Astounded by what I was seeing, I called my daughter-in-law outside to take a look. That is when the lights began to disappear, first one, then the other four according to the order in which they appeared. They did not fade or twinkle out, they simple were gone, as though someone had flipped a light switch.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My daughter-in-law and I watched this sequence of lights appearing and disappearing four more times. So I cannot say if we saw 5 or 25 lights. But I can say that they were individual. They were not connected to each other or a craft of some sort. The sky was clear and still light enough that we could see that there was nothing else in the sky. No planes, helicopters, or any other air craft. There were no kites or balloons either. And I can say without doubt that they were not flares being dropped as there was nothing there to drop them. Just as they were not fireworks being shot off from the ground. There were no tell tale trails of smoke. And there was no sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The whole incident took less than a minute, so even if I had the presence of mind to grab a camera, there was no time to take pictures. I immediately reported the event to MUFON. Two hours later a black helicopter appeared flying about half a mile south of us. It flew in from the west (from Luke perhaps) then came north to circle the EXACT spot the lights had appeared in before it flew off to the south.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I learned later from MUFON that these lights were seen 30 miles southeast of us only five minutes after we witnessed them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I know these lights were not nuts and bolts objects. In fact, I got the distinct impress while watching these lights that they were alive and popping in and out of our dimension. My personal belief is that they were not ETs but Angels.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I stated before, I did report this event to MUFON. But when I heard you speak on Coast to Coast I thought you should be aware of my sighting as well. And too, I am interested in hearing what you think I saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thank you.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

As I shut the door and looked up into the clear sky, I was shocked to observe something I can not explain. In the sky to my 11 &#39;o clock traveling from west to east was a blurred almost invisible formation, only one; with what looked to be three tailing lights [tail lights?]. The lights were dim and blurred/covered partially as if what ever was making the rest of the craft [invisible] was having trouble or could not fully cloak the three tail lights. I know that this craft in fact was not invisible because as it traveled off at about a couple hundred feet above tree line, it blurred the stars it passed under from my point of view. I only saw the craft for what seemed to be a full ten seconds and in that 10 seconds the unknown craft covered 25 degrees of the sky from over my head towards the eastern sky, but I did notice there was no sound at all in the sky&#39;s at the time it w! as passing. I could not make out the actual full shape of the craft. Again I want to add this was a clear night sky with all stars visible in a suburban neighborhood with calm to no wind.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The blueish light was horseshoe shaped, with sharpish points.  The orange light was more circular, but not perfect.  The lights faded and came back in intensity as the clouds passed under.  The two lights were directly overhead.  The moon was visible to the northwest and a star was visible slightly northwest.  Eventually, the clouds overpowered the lights, and they disappeared.  Also worth noting, this was near downtown Tulsa so the building lights overpowered a lot of weaker star light.  These lights were far enough above any manmade structure, as well as above the clouds, to be sure that there was nothing that any of us could think of what could be causing it.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was low enough to the ground that I can tell you without that it was not any airplane I have ever seen ( My Father is in the U.S Military, so I have been to plenty of military bases around the U.S and have seen many planes ). It was like I previously stated, a triangle shaped craft, but made no sound. And at the low altitude the craft was at, and the speed it was flying, I would assume I would have heard some noise. Not far ahead of the craft was and airplane, I believe to be a commuter. The craft made a very sharp, almost 90 degree bank, and headed towards the planes direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is not the first time I have seen this type of triangle shaped craft in Chippewa Falls. There have been 3 other encounters with this same type of unidentified craft. This sighting was the first where I have been alone without any witnesses to back up my encounter. The previous 3 had 2 other witnesses not including me in the vehicle at the time.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

3/23/10 01:45|El Paso|TX|Changing|unkown|Bright white light along the side of mountain, that changed shape and cast a huge glow around it.|4/13/10|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/074/S74768.html|64|ndxe201003| Bright white light along the side of mountain, that changed shape and cast a huge glow around it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Location: I was in the East side of El Paso, TX looking towards the West. The objects were just behind the mountain ridge on the west side. So it was on the other side of the ridge and down a long the side of it just slightly out of my sight. The El Paso ridge is for the most part barren and too steep for anyone drive on. Only helicopters could get to where the lights were located.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Description: I could not see the craft itself, but the light coming from it was extremely bright. In order for human technology to reproduce how bright it was, it would need to be a large collection of flood lights in one place. I could just see the very edge of the light source, before the shape of the light changed and appeared to actually be two craft crossing paths over and over again. As the lights moved around, it would cast a lingering haze on the clouds nearby that would resemble a lightning strike in the sky (the light did not flutter though like lightning does, it was constant). The color was pure white, this never changed about it. There was no blinking lights that would suggest man made craft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I live nearby an airport, and have become very used to identifying different craft in the dark. None of our craft can produce such a bright light that far away. I see this ridge every night at the same time, it has never been there before. So these lights were probably not caused by any sporting event (also why would you have a sporting event at 1:45 in the morning?)<n>

My boyfriend is very familiar with that area &amp; he had no explaination of it could be either.

It was about 100 feet up from where we were standing, and made absolutely no noise.  It had a tail of light. It streaked down towards the city, moving much too fast to be some sort of human aircraft, and way too low, plus you would be able to hear the engine from that distance.  We only saw it for about 30 seconds before it streaked away.  It seemed to be able to stop very quickly and hover directly before hitting the ground, but didn&#39;t slow down, for it disappeared quickly.  It seemed to be lit up from the inside, glowing yellow.<n>

As i approached a stop sign, i stoped to carefully observe the light.East Troy, WI has it&#39;s own small airport and I am used to seeing airplanes all the time, but this was out of the ordinary.  The light was huge (Maybe 5x that of a star)  The night was clear so there wasn&#39;t any clouds obstructing my view. It seemed to be hoovering, so I just continued to watched it.  I was on the phone with my friend who lives on the other side of town and told her to look outside and see if she could see what i was seeing.  She said she could see it and said it deffinetly didn&#39;t look like a plane. And then it started to do the most strangest of things.  It started to sway back and forth. Like a jellyfish underwater?  Then seemed to rapidly accelerate in speed. All of this occured within a matter of secconds.  At this point i had to proceed in leaving the stop! sign.  I tried to look for the light again but it disapeared over the tops of the trees<n>

From the moment I stepped outside, my dogs were acting jittery, and I too felt like I was being watched. So I looked around at my surroundings, and saw no one. Then as I started to mumble to myself that it was probably just nothing, I heard like a whirring kind of noise. So I rechecked the area and no one was in sight, that is until I looked up. In the sky maybe 90 feet over, and above my head I saw the believed UFO. I stared at it in silence, and disbelief  for a few minuets when my dogs got worse.  It looked like a round disked, circle shape, with a rounded hump, or top, on the surface of the aircraft. Outlining the shape of the bottom surface, were glowing, no flashing red, and yellow-orange lights. It was flying in a downward angle as if to land in the vast abandoned cow-field not so far away. So I ran inside and asked my sister’s boyfriend if they (humans), had designed a mo! del like the one described above.  He simply shook his head and said no.  I was scared, and shocked. I had never believed in said “aliens”, or “UFO’s”, until that Tuesday night, that I saw a horrifyingly real, UFO, or alien aircraft.  I had never expected to see one, in all my life, and especially not in my own yard, flying, too low to be permitted to pilots from this world, above my head!<n>

The object was in sight for approx. 15 seconds before going behind my neighbor’s house.  The object was flying within our atmosphere approx. 5000 feet and flying fast.  No sound came from the object when it flew overhead.<n>

The sky was clear; there were plenty of stars visible.  On returning to my house I looked up to see four bright red dots (they looked like red stars initially) moving very slowly across the sky in a northerly direction.  They remained visible for about 3-5 minutes before slowly fading away at approximately the same point in the sky.  I called my wife out to see them, and over the next few minutes another two stars/dots appeared and faded away at approximately the same place as the previous objects.  Finally, my son came down and saw another two appear and fade away in the same way.  I have never seen anything like this before in my life!<n>

While trying to drive and look up at this object, the object, even though flying straight, seemed to turn and look towards us. I remember I saw what I can only describe as two eyes, that were about the size of can of pop in circumference, and bright blue, look back towards us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Whatever I saw, then flew back up into the clouds.

As it became closer it was obvious that the lights were blinking in a circular fashion around the bottom of what appeared to be a disc shape. The shape seemed to get lower until it was probably only approximately 100 meters above the car and continued straight along the path of the road heading in the opposite direction. Although it was difficult to judge distance and size accurately (since it was dim with only the light from some nearby buildings and street lights,) it seemed to be the size of a small rancher.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am not someone who was terribly convinced until I witnessed this. The episode gave me a very sinking, powerless feeling. I broke down in tears when I saw it although at first I couldn&#39;t even quite place what the object was.<n>
3/20/10 23:00|Laconia|NH|Changing|1hr 30  min.|UFO Sighting in Laconia|4/13/10|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/074/S74787.html|79|ndxe201003| UFO Sighting in Laconia<n> <n><n> <n><n> My name is D.  I am sixteen years old and I live in New Hampshire.  Last Saturday night I went out with my girlfriend, who lives in Laconia, when we had the following experience:  I was with her around 11.  We wanted to take her Mom’s car because it was nicer and we wanted to go look at the stars.  We went to Fun Spot at the back parking lot in Laconia.  There were 8 cars already there when we arrived.  Little by little, the cars started leaving one by one.  We were the last car in the parking lot.  Then the lights of the parking lot and the lights of the houses around us and the lights of the houses down the street started to go out one by one.  Then my girlfriend noticed something blocking the moon and asked, &#34;What was that?&#34;  I knew it wasn’t a cloud because it moved back against the wind and blocked the moon again.  I don’t know how to explain this but it turns into a ball when it wants to slow down and move around quickly and when it wants to go fast, straight, it turns into a flat plate with maze box-shaped lined lights.  These were on all the time. The colors were dim yellowish white and did not change. I cannot tell whether these were part of the bottom or not.  It flipped a lot.  I did not know which side was right or up on it.  It was doing this over the trees  across the street from the parking lot.  It suddenly crossed the street towards our car. Its size was as big as 14 houses.  It was really quiet. That’s when we had to leave.  But I did not have time to turn on the headlights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We put the clutch in to start the car and jammed it into 1st and floored it.  The front end got picked up and the car could not move.  We steered left and right but the car just kept on going up into the air. My girlfriend was scared and she had boogers coming out of her nose while I was cursing.  The car was going up and the back wheels were off of the ground. Then I looked out of my window and saw that the parking lot park lines started getting smaller. Both our windows were down this whole time.  The front windshield started to crack and shake and the cracks spread from the passenger side to the driver’s side. It popped outwards like it was pulled out.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Something yanked my wrist. Not aggressively.  And the whole time in my head something was telling me “Don’t panic,” or “Don’t be scared.”  And it wasn’t in English in my head but I got the meaning.   It wasn’t a language – I don’t know how to explain it.   And on my girlfriend’s side, it had her half-way out of the window.   Her butt  was off of her seat, maybe one-and-a-half or  two feet?  and the car was pointed almost completely straight up at the stars – yet I saw no stars.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Every time I tried looking at it, in front, a white film went over my eyes.  It was kind of like staring at the sun with your eyelids closed.  I could not hear her screaming but I know that she was screaming. My ears felt like they kept on popping from the altitude.  I couldn’t hear.  The smell was like unbearable, like you want to close your nose.  It was spicy, like pepper-sprayish, and clean at the same time – it was a smell that you could stand but you would close your nostrils because it still smells bad.  When I tried to fight and get my wrist back in the car, that’s when the grip got stronger.  It was pulling my left arm up out of the window – there was no pain but it was strong – ….  I was trying to fight off the grip on my wrist.  My tongue was numb.  The horn beeped  by accident and the grip got a little loose.  It beeped again in the struggle and my arm flopped down in the car.  My girlfriend also fell back in her seat and we realized we were still up in the air. ! It  took 2 seconds for the car to drop. When we dropped, the air bags came out.  We floored it  as fast as we could through the town.  It was almost a straightaway to go to my girlfriend’s house with very few turns to take.  During this time, both of us couldn’t stop crying.  We arrived at her house and her Mom asked, “What happened?” All this took place from 11pm to 12:30 am.  It seemed like we were in the air for 10 minutes and it felt like it was forever.    Her Mom called the police, and a policeman came.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The policeman did not believe us when we first told him what had happened until he looked at the vehicle.  There were no scratches or dents or anything.  He said that there was no reason for this to have happened to the car when there are no dents or scratches and no reason for the windshield to shatter and pop out the way it did. He had no explanation for why the windshield popped outwards. Also, when I went to open my cell phone in front of the policemen, I got shocked by it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On Monday, I went to my doctor to get a whole physical to make sure I was OK.  My wrist had a puncture wound while my forearm has a cut that is semi-circular and there’s blood on it.  I do remember that when I first looked at my arm after I got it back in the car, it was red with blood.  But by the time we got to my girlfriend’s house, there was no blood anywhere.  On the center consul of the car, there is an imprint of her hand.  I don’t quite understand what the policeman said but it was something about the skin of her hand leaving an impression.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Now, I don’t like to feel bumps in the car, or feel anything that trembles like a boombox.  I don’t want to be out in dark areas at night. I also don’t like to walk out to my Mom’s car, anymore, outside. “<n>

I live in Laconia.  Last Saturday night, my boyfriend D came up to see me and we went out.  When we got to Fun Spot, in Laconia, we parked in the back in the separate parking lot.  We turned off the car and it was totally silent.  We were just sitting there and I looked up at the moon.  I saw this weird black-shaped object.  And then, I said to my boyfriend,  “What was that?” He looked up at it and he said, ”If it gets any closer, we need to leave.”  I kept staring at the moon to see if it was just a plane or something.  It moved back across the moon.  It was huge and it looked like it was zig-zagging or changing shape.   I couldn’t tell. He said, “I think it’s coming closer.” It flew so fast over the trees getting closer to where we were. It felt like it was zeroing in on us.  It blocked the moon. And then, we started panicking and driving away.  I thought were were going to hit the Bingo building.  We turned left but it felt like we went off of a jump – you know that feeling? like we were on a rollercoaster?   And we were in the air.  I was trying to pay attention to everything that was going on but it felt like I couldn’t.  When I looked up, everything was black.  The smell was not nice but it was like something you could stand.  It was an odor I’ve never smelled before.  I heard absolutely nothing – it was silent.  I felt immobilized like I had no control over what I was doing or over my body.  I could see nothing.  It was like opening your eyes in a pitch black room.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I felt really nervous and scared.  I don’t remember crying or screaming.  I held on to the center console because I felt like I was lifted.  I was holding on so tight that my thumbprint is imprinted on the center console.  And then, when I finally realized what was happening, I was so close to the windshield that my body was going forward with my arms behind me.  Everything was black.  I heard a loud noise like a horn.  Once.   And then, the car just dropped.  I hit my eye on the dashboard and the airbags came out.  I couldn’t believe what had just happened.   I held my face and I looked over at my boyfriend.  I saw that his left arm had blood. I said, “Are you OK?” I looked at the windshield and it was cracked, totally, but only on the passenger side.  I could see D but I couldn’t see anything outside.  The only thing that made the car drop was the sound of the loud horn.  When the car dropped,  there was a loud boom.  After that, we just drove so fast out of there. The smell went away after we drove away.   And I started crying.  And  I said, “What the h—l  just happened?”  My boyfriend  said, “I don’t know, I don’t know.”  I didn’t feel like they were following us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When we got home, my Mom said that she could hear me from the outside while I was freaking out.  I couldn’t stop crying.  My Mom said, “Calm down and tell me what happened.” I said, “You’re never going to believe me.” “Is it my car?”  she asked.<n> <n><n> <n><n> And I said, “Let me explain,” because I felt that if I didn’t explain it fast enough, it was just going to go away from my mind.  At about 12:15 am, a cop arrived.  I told him what had happened while I was sitting down at the dinner table.   My boyfriend was sitting next to me – it was then that I noticed that there was no more blood on his arm or his clothing.  The cop didn’t believe me at first until he finished looking at the car.  He told my Mom that there was no reason for the air bags to come out because nothing else on the car was damaged.  He didn’t check underneath the car but we found out later that the underside was totaled.  The cop said that he was going to the place where we had been.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I just felt thankful that we’d gotten out of there.  But I couldn’t stop crying for more than 2 hours afterwards.  My Mom said, “You should go take a shower and get the airbag dust off of you.”  But I didn’t want to be alone at all.  I felt lucky.   And there were no scratches or anything anywhere on my body.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The first night, my dream was that I was a little girl, maybe 6 or 7 years old, in an Elementary School classroom.  I was looking at myself as a little girl.  And then it was like the teacher called me up and I couldn’t talk or say anything - but everybody else seemed to say something for me.  Like everything I wanted to say, everybody else was saying it except for me.  They were saying exactly what I wanted say.  I have never had a dream like this before – where I am a little girl and see anything about the past.  I did not feel right at all.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am better now. I still worry about seeing this thing again and I pay attention to the sky at night.  I really don’t go out at night, anymore, because I’m scared. “<n>

I watched it for a second as it moved &amp; I said look do you see that &amp; we watched it for a few seconds and it appeared to be lighted.  He did not see it move as I did but all of a sudden it broke up into a lot of smaller pieces right as we watched it and it just vanished. The only way I can explain the way it looked was that it appeared to be a bunch of birds that were all together and then split apart and then just vanished.  I have not been able to stop thinking about it and I KNOW THAT THIS WASN&#39;T OF THIS PLANET.  There is no way that it was military or man made.  Just thought you would like to know.  Thanks<n>

We always thought they were just flares from the air force base uptown.  But that night was different, we heard jet engines like usual, then we saw 5-7 fighter jets flying around.  They were heading in the same direction, but not in any formation, heading West I believe.<n> <n><n> <n><n> But then we saw this single white dot a little to the east of the fighters, just sitting there.  At first we thought it was a star, but then the fighters came around, and the object just dissapeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The fighters started circling the area were the object was, then started heading north to the air force base.<n>

After a great day of fishing we headed to the house to unload clean up and cook some fish.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At around 9:00pm my father was frying some fish outside and my uncle and I were preparing some food in the house.  My father opens the outside door and calls us out to go outside quick! We run outside and he points to the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were facing North and we saw at first 4 amber (lighter flame orange) orbs moving in towards land coming from the east (ocean side).  They were about airplane altitude but I would say just a bit lower in altitude.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They were moving very slowly but at a semi constant speed but almost evenly spaced apart traveling in a straight line playing follow the leader sort of speak.  There was absolutely no sound!  No red or green lights which is mandatory for aircrafts, and the sky was clear of any cloud cover.  We could see all the stars out that night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As the first orb got to about mid sky, it gave off a soft pulse effect and zoomed out of our atmosphere at an incredible speed, almost instantaneously turning into a distant white star, then after a second it was absolutely GONE!  It did not break the horizon like any regular aircraft, this thing broke out of our atmosphere! The following 2 followed suit, doing exactly what the first one did in the exact point in the sky traveling in the same direction.  By the time the forth one was reaching the spot in the sky where the others had gone, 3 more same looking orbs popped out from the same direction from where the other 4 originated from.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This time the first one after about 10 seconds of moving slowly following the same path as the others, decided to zoom out to the point of looking like a white star and came back as the orange orb really fast!  After, the 6th orb decided to do a little dancing zig zag side to side a couple of times then got back in line.  They all followed the same direction and broke out through the atmosphere 1 by 1.  Truly was an amazing experience.  Ive tried to think of all the things it could have been and I only have one answer……UFO’s.  Our neighbor was present during the event with us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My Uncle got his camera but its not an amazing camera and could not get a good picture of the spectacle. But the event will forever be imprinted in my head.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

First began at approx. 23:00 with a large, fast moving, blue lighten (6 blue lights), curved, arch like formation over some trees in the distance. 2 witnesses saw this event, the third missed it by a fraction of a second.  About 15 minutes later, a similar craft with 4 lights was seen moving much faster in a different direction across the sky, except this time it was a light grayish-brown shade.  Moments later, in the opposite side of the sky, 5 very distinct, very bright lights slowly glided across the sky.  These lights had a symmetrical formation and moved in and out like a flowing organism.  All three witnesses were taken by the sight, and amazed at the possibility of three sightings in a matter of minutes.  Then, about 10 minutes later, out of the center of the sky appeared two, candle like lights floating symmetrically across the sky, to the edge of the horizon.  Flowing i! n and out in perfect motion. And again these two appeared in the same way another 5 minutes later.  Next, after about 15 minutes of waiting, a single glowing object appeared on the far side of the horizon and floated behind the home, out of sight to the witnesses.  Then, to conclude the experience, 5 very prominent, bright candle like objects, floated very slowly, very low over the home.  They drifted further and closer to each other and seem to have a distinct pattern to them.  They drifted slowly across the sky, and went out of sight approximately 45 seconds after they appeared. the last event was significantly longer than any other sighting of the night.  After this, we saw nothing else and clouds rolled in from the south east.  We noticed that all crafts traveled in the direction of the stars, and each of them had a distinct, candle glowing like form.  However, the first were bright blue.<n>

I stared out of the car window and it was in the shape of a huge triangle with many, many windows.  We passed it so quickly I was in awe.  I didn&#39;t have a chance to take a picture.

I always keep my porch light off and my kitchen light off with only my dining light on.  I also close the door almost shut to keep the smoke out of my house and so I can see the stars better.  I often look into the sky at the stars which are very visible.  I noticed a very large and bright white light coming in my direction.  I noticed it zigzagging back and forth in quick changes in direction.  I thought that maybe clouds may be causing the illusion of the zigzagging.  As I watched it, I rolled my eyes off it on each side to make certain there were no clouds, there were none (was taught this by the military).  All of the sudden the object moved upward out of sight very quickly.  I could see the light go from very large to a tiny light to nothing at all but with a light trail behind it upward.  Just to make this clear, I served in the Marine Corp and worked with UH-1 and Cobra helicopters both at night and during the day.  I’ve been around the flight line both night and day with both rotary and fixed wings.  I did not see a starboard or port light on this object, nor did I hear any noise coming from it.   As close as this object was from me, if this were a fixed wing aircraft I would have surely heard the thrusters especially as quick as it went upward out of sight.  If it were a helicopter, I would have heard the chopping of the blades and there is no doubt in my mind that a helicopter could not have climbed that quickly upward to out of sight in two or three seconds.  The object was coming from the west with probably 15 degrees of it to the north.   Almost as soon as the object excelled out of sight, a plane (jet) of some type flew over my location coming from the south west.  I could hear and see the port and starboard lights on it.  I’ve never seen or heard of anything with the kind of speed which I witnessed tonight.  The use of &#34;I: in this statement also includes my wife who also saw it<n>

Instantly I heard dogs barking and howling in the Northwest direction of the neighborhood. Right away I looked up in the sky and I always do when I go outside, and to my left I saw a low-flying SILENT vehicle that was heading Southeast to Northwest direction.  It was close enough (about 100 yards up) that I saw the bottom of the triangle shaped vehicle.  I was thinking it would hit some trees or crash because it was so low.  I could see the bottom of the jet sized vehicle, but it was triangle shaped and didn&#39;t look like a plane or jet.  There were bright orange lights on the bottom.  I watched it zoom by at about 100 miles an hour - it looked like a fast moving car speed.  I could only watch the vehicle between the trees, probably for about 5 seconds.  We ran to see if we could see anything on the other side of the trees but it was no where in sig! ht.  The dogs kept barking when the vehicle passed over where the barking noises came from.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After the vehicle had passed I stayed outside looking in the sky for other signs and I saw a lighter gray trail in the sky.  It was probably from some airplane though because is was straight and further up in the sky than the low-flying vehicle.<n>

For the past three months, I have watched the same UFO moving in the night sky over the Pine Barrens.  Every night without fail, it moves. It is also the brightest light in the sky, which also emits a faint pulse.  I believe it is masking itself as a star by maintaining a stationary position outside our gravity well giving the appearance of a star progressing across the night sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Every night I watch it move in short erratic patterns, vertical, horizontal and circular, which I believe is to maintain its fixed position. In the past month I have discovered several other similar lights in the sky that I had originally thought were stars.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My father, two of my sisters, my brother in-law, my mothers first cousin and her house mate and two of my friends, have all confirmed what I have been watching for the past three months. I do not drink or take any kind of mind or mood altering drugs.  All of the above mentioned people were sober at the time they confirmed my sighting.  I am not looking to be put in the public eye.  I just want somebody to come out and verify my sighting, which has been ongoing for the past three months.<n> <n><n> <n><n> PS This is not a one time occurance!  It is an on going event every night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So if you decide to come out, you won&#39;t be dissapointed!

As we were making the final merge onto the interstate I noticed a bright glow on the underside of one of the few white clouds that were in the sky.  As I looked harder I noticed a dark line pointing up towards it at about a 45 degree angle.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I kept my eye on it until it disappeared behind trees, due to the bends in the I-10.  About 7-10 minutes later we were approaching Intersection 196, Capital Circle NE, when we finally got a good look at what we’d seen from a distance.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There were two objects.  The first was a small, highly reflective, bullet shaped object with no wings or tail.  The second was rather more startling.  Keeping pace behind the bullet shaped object was ‘V’ shaped object that was quite simply the biggest think  I&#39;ve ever seen in the sky.  Although a good distance away it was easily the size of a football stadium, possibly larger.  The object was dark gray/brown in color.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My wife was quite shaken up by this.  I was excited!  She slammed on the breaks pretty hard on the off ramp when she saw this thing and noticed other people around her doing the same thing, looking up at the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Anyone passing Intersection 196, heading west, MUST have got an even better view of it.  And it says something as to how slow it was moving if we managed to catch up with it.<n>

The sky was absolutely clear, with a sliver of a Moon that looked like a big smile, and tons of visible stars. I had spotted a satellite moving directly overhead moving from south to north, and we watched it until we couldn’t see it anymore. Just then, my wife says, “Look , there’s another one!”, and points due west. I turned to look, and I saw a  very, very bright white light moving from the west toward the east. The light had a blue tint to it, kind of like an LED light bulb is, as opposed to an incandescent bulb which is much more yellow.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I first turned and saw the light, it was at around 45 to 50 degrees, moving fairly quickly west to east in a straight line, it’s path just south of us. If I held an aspirin tablet between my fingers at arm’s length, that would be slightly larger, but reasonably comparable to the size of the light. It was by far the brightest thing in the sky.  As the light moved to about 85 degrees, almost directly overhead, it never deviated in intensity, flashed, or seemed directional in any way, like the headlight of a low flying airplane would. It then began to move in a wide arc toward the southeast. As it did, it began to slowly dim, until it was the size and intensity of  any random star in the sky. In fact, it now actually did look like a satellite, except for the fact that it was turning toward the southeast. We watched it for another few seconds, and then it just winked out.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My wife and I were discussing what we had just seen, still facing the direction we had last seen it. I was excited, as I have witnessed the same type of light on two other occasions from my backyard (which, incidentally, faces due west), but I was always alone without any other witnesses.  As we were talking, there was a sudden bright flash of light, similar to a camera flash, at about 45 degrees, just a bit east of where we saw the light blink out, maybe 15 - 20 seconds before. We both looked up and saw what appeared to be 2 satellite sized lights moving  SE to NW in a path that would go directly over our heads. They were moving parallel to each other, although one was moving slower. As we watched, the slower one started to “pulse”. It was going from looking like a satellite, to slowly dimming until it was completely dark, and then slowly brightening back to looking like a satellite again. I then realized that the faster of the two actually was a satellite, as it continued ! across the sky in a straight line at the same speed. The “pulsing” light now started moving in a more northerly direction rather than northwesterly as it had been. It began moving slower and slower until it eventually stopped, hanging at about 55 -60 degrees in the eastern sky, doing it’s pulsating thing. As I turned back toward the northwest to see if the other satellite (which by now had passed by us) was still acting like a satellite (which it was), we noticed a small plane flying directly toward us at around 700 ft headed toward a small landing strip a mile or so down the road. I immediately looked back to the “pulsing” light. It grew dim and bright a few more times, then it stayed steadily bright, and looked like an ordinary star.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The plane served as a comparison to the original light we saw come from the west. First, the plane’s headlight was very yellow in color and much dimmer. It also had obvious green and red flashing lights, and it was loud; very easily heard over the breaking of the waves, whereas the mystery light was completely silent. Also, the plane’s presence gave me a sense of how high the light was. I guesstimated the plane to be at about 500 - 700 ft and descending, which made me feel like the first time we saw the light, it was about twice that height. The second time, it looked as high as the other satellite, even though it was only 15 - 20 seconds later. My wife told me that when she first saw the light and said, “Look, there’s another one”, it was the size of a satellite, and in a fraction of a second, it was super bright and huge, which is right when I saw it the first time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After the plane flew by, the light, which was now stationary, and looked like an ordinary star, faded out and we didn’t see it again. I also wanted to say that during the first part of the sighting, my wife had a feeling of dread, and had started to cry. She kept saying, “I don’t like it.” over and over. I, on the other hand, was excited, and was extremely happy to have a witness with me.<n>

It changes form and does not look like anything that is man made. when looked at through a scope, it goes from looking like multiple colors from further away, but when focused closer becomes many lights and is definately inside our atmosphere.  Our background is we are just regular people.  We saw something similar about 2 months ago that looked like an atom in the sky. these seem to always be below the moon (closer to the ground than the moon)the one we saw a couple of months ago was red and blue colors and was constantly spinning.  It looked like a giant atom.<n>

Minutes later we noticed a rancid smell and smoke in the air quickly followed by the howl of emergency vehicle sirens.  We tried to get a closer look, but the authorities had arrived and would not allow us any closer to the crashed craft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> That night, there were also reports of a flying saucer hovering over a remote park on the outskirts of Fort Madison, approximately 2 miles from the Fort Madison High School.  We cannot confirm whether or not this was the same object or two objects that happened to be in the same area.<n>

A faintly visible shape was behind the lights, perhaps disc-shaped, moving steadily West.  We pulled into the student parking lot of Walton High School and exited the vehicle.  At this time we noticed that there was now only one light.  We hurried toward the stadium to see it better, whereupon the object slowly moved into a lone set of cloud cover.  We could see the single light shining and flickering in the cloud.  I ran to get my camera from the car and my friend announced the object had disappeared.  He stated it flickered and dimmed and then disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.  PD))<n>

3/18/10 10:00|Carlisle|PA|Light|4-5 minutes|2 very bright objects spotted  on sunny ,cloudless day|4/13/10|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/074/S74716.html|106|ndxe201003| 2 very bright objects spotted  on sunny ,cloudless day<n> <n><n> <n><n> Myself and 3 other men were cleaning up a lawn for spring, there had been a lot of geese flying overhead in the morning and I was looking up often to locate flocks.  As I was scanning the sky I noticed a very bright light that was moving forward and reversing directions to fly back where it was just at and also, hovering.  It was moving in smooth fluid motions, not in a jerky manner. The flash from this object was very bright and constant.  We were watching this object for a couple of minutes as it was moving about the sky.  All of a sudden, we noticed another bright light in the sky fairly close to the first one sighted.  The second object seemed to be moving in a circular or looping motion.  The four of us continued watching these objects for another minute or so until both objects were either to far to see them any longer or they disappeared/vanished.  We did not see the second object moving towards the first object at all during this incident, it seemed ! to just appear close to it. When I returned home later in the day I tried to duplicate the brightness of the steady &#34;flash&#34; from the objects, I put a piece of aluminum foil under my overhead kitchen light with the shiny side towards the light bulb to reflect the light.  Even that was not as bright as the objects we saw.This incident occurred on 3-18-2010 at about 10:00 AM.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

We noticed a bright object in the early morning sky. We focused my video camera on it, we then centered the object on the video cameras screen, then paid no attention to it. We then talked about what we had seen earlier that night over the lake, then turned back to the camera, and noticed that the object had moved. We continued to observe the object until it suddenly disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We thought that the object could have been a star, or planet at first but quickly realized that the earth simply doesn&#39;t rotate fast enough to account for how far the object progressed across the sky, and even if it were a star or planet the path it would have followed across the sky would have been entirely different.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We then thought about the idea of the object being a aircraft, however I did not see any anti-collision, landing lights, navigation lights, or wing lights that were blinking at a timed interval on this object. The object appeared to be pulsating with no predetermined order, and flashing an array of colors.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I further concluded that the object could not have been a aircraft because the object was on a eastern heading towards the rising sun so with that being said after the objects lights went off, the sunlight would have reflected off of the aircrafts fuselage still allowing it to be visible.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am former Air Force, and I have been around a lot of different airframes. I&#39;ve seen many different aircraft in the sky, and I can identify all of the airframes the USAF currently has in service, along with a good portion of those in the civilian sector on sight. However this object doesn&#39;t appear to be any airframe I am familiar with. Let alone the object was traveling at a extremely low airspeed, which in most cases the majority of aircraft would have a very hard time trying to stay airborne at such a speed. Not to mention the object was either in or extremely close to the NO FLY ZONE located around the Perry Nuclear Power Plant near Madison, Ohio.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I eventually lost sight of the object when it suddenly disappeared from sight. I saw it disappear with my own eyes, an my friend saw it disappear on camera. We managed to capture the object disappearing on tape and we analyzed it frame by frame the best we could. I will be posting the videos link and the images link for the frame by frame breakdown below so you can see what we witnessed for yourself.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Video link:<n> <n><n> <n><n> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bAPdTd7oZqk<n> <n><n> <n><n> Frame by frame breakdown:<n> <n><n> <n><n> http://s773.photobucket.com/albums/yy20/robertg87/<n> <n><n> <n><n> Equipment: JVC Everio with tripod   Any advice, comments, ideas, or information as to what this object might be would be greatly appreciated.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am intrigued by this object and would love to have this footage analyzed but I have no idea on how to go about doing that.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thanks<n>

The Big Dipper was right above the yard and I was admiring the stars.  An object suddenly came into view overhead.  It was flying a little higher than a helicopter typically flies around my neighborhood.  However, there was no sound - there were no lights - and it had a reddish tint to it.  It just quickly floated off to the North.  I did seem to hear a small rumble after it had passed out of sight.  It almost seemed like it didn&#39;t hold form... yet it was in sort of a cigar shaped formation.  I have always had interest in UFO&#39;s and whatnot.  You always hear of flying saucers actually being weather balloons.  Well, this could have been just that... it did sort of look like a really big deflated balloon flying very quickly.  I don&#39;t know what it was.  All I know is that it made the hair on my neck stand up!<n>

I looked at the bike, shut the barn, and the night was so beautiful I just looked up at the stars.  The sky was so clear and the stars were so crisp, I wandered to the middle of the yard trying to pick out constellations.  Heck, the stars were so bright, they ALL looked like constellations, so I just decided to head in to bed, and as I lowered my eyes, I saw it!  Off in the distance, over my neighbor&#39;s roof, there it was.  It was a dark sphere, roughly 10+ times the size of the biggest star, with strobe-like blue, white and red lights flashing around it in all kinds of ways.  Like one of those kid&#39;s balls you hit and the lights go wild inside of it, only on the outside of what I saw.  The lights were mostly around the edge, with two constant white lights that came into view from time ! to time, as it would rotate off and on.  It hovered, totally quiet, rising a little, or dropping some from time to time.  I didn&#39;t want to leave it for a camera or to get someone up for fear of missing it doing something or being gone.  I watched from my neighbor&#39;s side yard and for awhile and from the big empty lot across the street where the school used to  be.  I watched, and watched and watched, and it hovered and slid around totally quiet.  I watched and heard a few planes go by, and heard three trains pass through while I watched.  This thing made no sound.  I kept trying to see under or around it for something supporting it, or waiting for it to make some kind of move I&#39;d recognize as a plane, etc.  Nothing.  After some time, it became harder to distinguish the color of the lights, and I realized it was getting smaller, and then I realized it was moving away from me.  It just kept getting smaller and smaller, bobbing around until it became just a pinprick like the st! ars, then it just disappeared down behind the trees.  When I c! ame back in, I found I had been watching it for an hour!  It was 1:10 on the microwave when I closed the door.  It was the most incredible thing I&#39;ve ever seen!  I have no idea how big it really was, because I have no idea how far away it was when I started watching it.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was somewhat unseasonably warm out and I was enjoying the upcoming sunset.  I looked in a Northwestern direction- towards Mt. Charleston- when I saw a dark circular object in the sky.  This object appeared to stay still in the sky for several minutes, when I called out for my family to come look.  There appeared to be no illumination coming from the object, so that ruled out aircraft or even a meteor, as there was no trail of smoke behind it.  My son saw the object and ran back inside to grab binoculars.  At this point the object began to very slowly move upwards and farther away in the sky.  Looking through the binoculars, my son and I saw a well lit aircraft that we presumed was an airplane (it was to the leftside of the object )and as soon as both objects were visible in the scope of the binoculars, the dark object suddenly disappeared.  My husband did not have his glasses on and so he was unable to view this object.<n>

There was a shiny, fish/football shaped object floating above and a small distance from the plane.  It was rotating on it&#39;s axis, moving very slowly, much slower than the plane.  The object was about a forth smaller than the plane, accounting for perspective. It went in a perfectly straight line and stopped.  It seemed to stop rotating, then changed the direction of its rotation from counter-clockwise to clockwise.  Then as another plane passed below it, it changed its trajectory and moved higher and away at a slight angle until neither I nor my boyfriend could see it anymore.  He didn&#39;t believe me that it was a UFO, he said it was balloons, but I&#39;ve never seen balloons do what that object did.<n>

I was looking out my two rear bedroom windows into the dark when I noticed some very odd lights out in the woods above a house on the other side of our neighborhood pond.  It was very dark but you could still see the dark outlines of the pine trees in the woods and the lights from the neighboring houses.  The flying lights reminded me of a police car’s lights and I thought I was catching a reflection in the window glass from the room behind me.  My son’s bedroom was directly behind me and a police officer lives up a road right in front of my house.  The mail box the police officer uses is also right across the road from my house.  The lights were almost standing still and then moved very slowly to the left.  I wondered what the police car was up to so I turned around to see out windows in the front of the house.  That’s when I was shocked by the fact that my bedroom do! or was closed and that what I was looking at was not a reflection.  I stood up and put my face and hands to the glass to block all reflections from other lights in my room and I saw clearly a large set of lights in a very strange configuration moving very slowly to the left over my neighbors house. There were three colors of lights.   The largest lights were a pair of rectangular almost square lights.  The light on the right was bright blue and the light connected to it on the left was bright white.  Both of these lights were very bright and the shape was very clear.  Two small red lights were above these lights, one on the left and one on the right.  One small red light was in the center on the bottom.  The whole thing looked like a mixed up set of tail lights on the rear end of a car.  I was talking to my father the whole time and he said that I was starting to worry him.  I described what I saw to him and he said go outside to see if I could hear anything.  I went out my! back door onto my porch and stood on my picnic table.  I coul! d still see the objects lights very clearly.  The set of lights moved slowly, there was absolutely no noise.  I continued to talk to my father and I was getting very excited.  I knew that what I was seeing had to be something very odd maybe a UFO.  I was convinced of this by the slow speed, the distinct shape of lights, the brightness of the lights, and the dead silence.  The lights then moved on to the left behind a larger set of pine trees.  When I moved my head back and forth I could still catch glimpses of it.  The lights then started to come back to the right and then the moved back to the left even further until I could not see it at all.  While I was standing on my picnic table talking to my father after the lights vanished, I saw the small white lights of an airplane way up in the sky.  The light was minute compared to what I had just seen in the woods.  I listened and I could hear the airplanes engines.  That made me sure I had seen a flying craft that made absolutely no no! ise.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

At first thought it was a meteor but was too dull and circular and when it split into three all three were still the same size and circular.  Very strange, if it was a meteor it was like no other meteor I have ever seen.  I could only see it for a few seconds as they passed out of the viewing range of my skylight.<n>

There were also 5 lights, that seemed to line the outside of the object.

The group was difficult to see because of the color of the lights.  If you weren&#39;t watching closely you could miss them.  We heard no engine sounds during this time.<n>

They were nearly directly above the flight path for jets landing at Sky Harbor Airport, and appeared to be at an elevation that aircraft would need to be pressurized or at least would leave a vapor trail.  Although they seemed directly above the flight pattern for landing, I expect they were slightly north/northeast.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My sense were that these objects could have been parachutes as they may seemed rectangular in shape, and since they didn&#39;t appear to be moving laterally, that&#39;s all I could think of.  While watching them for about 15 seconds, a third object appeared to the east of them but was a bright blue and of the same shape.  This third object reinforced my reasoning for thinking they were parachutes, because I could imagine that being a parachute color.  The only thing that baffled me about the parachute theory was who would attempt, or get permission to parachute in this area with such heavy airline traffic.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About 10 seconds after I first noticed the blue object, it disappeared.  I didn’t see it move or actually disappear, as I was talking to a passerby about it, but when I looked back up it was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The remaining two objects maintained their altitude, and moved to the west at what seemed to be a relatively slow speed.  I observed them for about 50 seconds, and there were no sounds, vapor trails, etc. That&#39;s it.<n>

Since its only the beginning of Spring the trees haven&#39;t filled with leaves yet so I had a great view of the sky from my small backyard which is normally covered by a massive tree&#39;s leaves.  I looked up and to the south I saw what I thought were 2 of those shiny, metallic looking balloons that have helium in them.  They were very shiny and looked spherical in shape.  The objects seemed to be moving slowly and then they started doing a sort of dance, flying around within 30 ft of each other.  Then I noticed a peculiar detail about the way they were moving.  We just got through a really bad storm on Long Island and it was our first day of Sun, a really beautiful day with few clouds if any but it was windy.  The direction of the wind would have been blowing these things away but they stayed in the same general area for about 30 seconds, staying close to each other.  I turned and went to get my camera b! ut before I opened the door to go inside I took a last glance to get a reference of where they were but they started moving a bit more actively and I returned looking at them.  They started moving apart and I saw one start moving upward and forward and it just took off in an instant, there was no vapor trail or anything,  I couldn&#39;t even see what the other one did as I was fixated on the one that zoomed off.  The whole event was no more than 45 seconds to a minute long.<n>

I then noticed a small circular object flying along side it.  The circular object slowed down to a speed much slower then the plane and disappeared behind the clouds.  At this point the plane flew over head, and I went outside for a closer look.  About 5 minutes passed and I then noticed the same object emerged from the clouds, stayed at the high altitude and started to fly south west at what looked like at a slow speed.  I could see the object better when it was directly over my house because it was heading closer to the sun.  The object looked like it was rotating because every time it rotated there was a brief reflection.  The Object stayed at a slow pace for 5 more minutes heading south west until it was no longer visible.<n>

It was dark and the stars were shining brightly.  I saw two things:  the first was clearly a jet airplane, very small and moving near the horizon in a southernly direction,  but with the blinking lights there was no question it was a jet.  I then saw what I first thought was a &#34;shooting star&#34; to the west of the jet, but it was moving in a north westerly direction--kind of at a 45 degree angle--moving UP, not down.  But it did not dissipate like a shooting star, it just kept moving upwards at a 45 degree angle at a high rate of speed for somthing that small.   It looked just like a twinkling star--similar to those in the sky around it--not like the far off jet I had already seen.   It continued to move up in the western sky, then slowed and stopped.  It looked just like the other twinkling stars in the sky.   Then it just stayed t! here, fixed.  I thought it must be another jet that had ascended then turned either away from me, or towards me, and would either grow larger or disappear, as planes at night do.  But it did neither.  It just stayed there with the same twinkling intensity for about 5 minutes.  I got tired of looking at and came inside.   This twinkling thing was probably a jet, but I&#39;ve never seen one just hang in the sky and not move at all.<n>

As i stared,... I noticed it to be 5 distinct shooting stars coming from the East going westbound.  Orange/amber in color, spaced apart as if they were &#39;tracer bullets&#39; in the sky moving extremely fast; uniform in direction and trajectory (or lack of trajectory - almost a straight line).<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was almost able to make out a chevron in the first, but they were so high up and moving so fast that it wasn&#39;t a vivid chevron per say, but the color did look un-natural to the night sky (dimmer but &#39;steadier glow&#39; than typical stars). The formation crossed the entire night sky and I lost sight of it as it headed further west/northwest coming from the east, almost directly overhead... about 70-80 degrees.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The shapes came together or it could have been the angle, but they disappeared as they &#39;converged&#39; still at approx 80 degrees.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The night sky was surprisingly clear and I immediately posted a question on yahoo answers dated 03/16/2010.  I do observe meteor showers and comets when in season, but this looked nothing like anything i had observed in the past...  the objects seemed to be flying extremely fast for any man made vehicle, but steadier (did not fade out) than shooting stars i&#39;ve seen in the past.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The color was clearly orange amberish.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;m no &#39;third kind encounter&#39; type of individual and I felt that anyone i told would think i&#39;m crazy... i&#39;m very much sane and i am a systems engineer so I&#39;m very empirical and quantitative.  I could not think of an explanation of how these were moving - i&#39;ve heard everything from space debris (crashed satellites) to meteors... but the &#39;way it was moving&#39; seemed very much like flight.<n>

Looking up, straight in front of me, facing north, I could see two red lights, side by side similar to the lights on an airplane.  However, the lights while they were red were dim and more of a reddish brown, no other lights flashing or otherwise were spotted.  The lights moved very uniform and very much in sync, flying south.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As the lights started to turn towards the east, at about ten seconds after initial sighting, the lights spread out far apart, again very much in uniform, flying very aerodynamic just like an airplane.  The lights continued to turn back towards the north, completing a ‘U’ shape trajectory, and the lights moved back towards each other in their original position, next to each other.  The lights moved consistently, never stopping and moved fast.  The total duration of the sighting was about 30 seconds.<n>

3/15/10 07:00|Crestline|CA|Disk|2 minutes|Bright UFO between 2 jets|4/13/10|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/074/S74890.html|140|ndxe201003| Bright UFO between 2 jets<n> <n><n> <n><n> UFO Sighting Report     March 15/2010     by ((name deleted))<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was going to my first day of training for the US Census which was to take place in Green Valley Lake which is in the San Bernardino Mountains of California.  I live in Crestline, California. My training started at 8:00am so I had to leave Crestline about 7:00am.  As I was leaving my home, traveling East along Lake Drive, close to Lake Gregory, I spotted three objects in the morning sky. It was a clear day and the sun was rising. I was about a block from having to make a right turn onto Lake Gregory Drive towards Hwy 18 when I spotted 3 flying objects.  I immediately slowed down and glanced in the rear view mirror for just and instant to see if there were any cars behind me.  I knew I had to make a turn at the stop sign and would possibly lose sight of them, so I milked the moment and took my time getting to the stop sign.  The objects were right in front of me and I had a perfect view through the front windshield.   2 of the objects were jets and the other was a bright glowing ! disc or sphere like UFO which was traveling right in between the 2 jets, flying about the same speed.  The jets had their after burners on and I could see the exhaust trail very clearly behind them.  The UFO on the other hand had no after burner or exhaust of any kind.  They were about 2:00 high and about 30,000 to 40,000 feet up.  The jets were small in comparison to the UFO which seemed to be about twice their size. The UFO looked like a bright planet or star, which is what I thought it was at first, but then I realized because it was right in the middle between the two jets and moving along with them, it could be neither.  Because the UFO was so bright, I thought the UFO might be reflecting the morning sun but the jets undersides were not reflecting the sun so I deduced that the UFO was lit up on its own accord. I could very well be wrong about that but I figured that the jets being a much duller silver would have been lit up by the sun as well, but they weren’t. I couldn’t ! tell if they were Military jets but they appeared to be so. Th! ey defin itely were not passenger planes and they were moving much to fast.  At first the UFO was centered on each side of the two wings of the both jets then as a few seconds passed, it lagged behind a little until it was near there tails.  I could make out the UFO more clearly then the jets because it was very bright and much larger and round. The contrast was exiting. I estimated the distance between the two jets and the UFO to be about a ½ mile to a mile on each side. The UFO seemed to darken a little from a bright starry silver to a shiny metallic silver. At one point it looked as if it had blinked off and on very quickly, right before it disappeared. It also seemed to get brighter right before it blinked out. This happened right before my eyes as the two jets kept on the same direction. I was amazed when it did this but this was not the first time I have seen UFO’s and I have seen them make this kind of maneuver before.  In fact I have seen them much closer as close as 100 feet! .  Back to this sighting, I was glued to this UFO the whole time then it was just gone. This happened right before I made the right turn onto Lake Gregory Drive. I watched a bit more and waited to see if the UFO would blink back in but it did not. As I continued to visually follow the jets I felt a thump as I went off the road onto a burm that was on the right. This happened about a block after I made the right turn. This spectacle had my full attention and I was fortunate that I didn’t hit anything on the right side of me other then dirt.  I put on the brakes and came to a stop along side the road, still not taking my eyes of the 2 jets. The 2 jets kept on flying in the same direction with the after burners still on and then gradually they disappeared over the top of the mountain ridge. This took about another minute. I also noted that the exhaust contrail behind the jets were the same, which was about two inches long, so I assumed they didn’t change there speed during the! entire sighting. The jets also did not change direction or di! stance f rom each other the entire time. I concluded that the jets where either escorting this UFO or chasing it. In any case because the UFO fell behind a bit of the jets and the jets didn’t slow down with it, it appeared that the UFO was in full control of the situation. I continued to watch a bit more after the jets and their exhausts contrails were gone hoping the UFO might appear somewhere else, but it didn’t as far as I could see. I had to get to my training class and drive a little faster to make up for the lost time. I did not tell anyone at training but I did tell my family when I got home. Later on that week, I told a couple friends who are UFO buffs. It was an interesting sighting to say the least.<n>

It headed our way with a straight and steady pace.  As it got closer I became sure it wasn&#39;t typical aircraft.  When it was about 1/4 mile away I started to be able to see what it was, a maybe football field sized object, &amp; shaped.  There were 4 lights on the corners and one larger light in the center.  The light had an unusual bluish white glow, it was not like any other light I have ever seen!<n> <n><n> <n><n> I rolled down my window to see if I could hear it- not! absolutely no sound, it was floating slowly across the treetops.

At first I dismissed it thinking that it was just a group of air planes from the nearby military base, but as we watch the lights go higher in the sky they began to divide into smaller points of light and dramatically change direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> By now we were curious, knowing that neither of us had seen anything move so quickly and precisely in the sky before.  The lights came closer and closer and were just below cloud level when all of the darting points reconvened and assumed a linear shape.  The lights were at an angle that made it impossible to tell for sure, but it looked almost like a bent line (chevron?) as it veered north.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What made it so peculiar and distinctively not an airplane was the in consistency of its movement and the way the lights divided themselves.

She called for me to stand up so that I could view with her as two orange objects streaked across the southern sky from west to east.  Travel from horizon to horizon took less than 5 seconds and, even though the travel pattern was basically straight, it appeared as if they moved closer and then farther from each other as they traveled.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The following night (March 15, 2010), at approximately the same time, the same event occurred but this time there were three of them and they were more directly overhead, again, moving from west to east.  This time the maneuvering between the three objects was much more obvious as the distance between them closed and then opened several times.  Basically, though, the trajectory was straight and very fast.  There was no noise on either occasion.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
3/14/10 20:30|Bozeman|MT|Light|5 mins|Bright light in sky then fades|4/13/10|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/074/S74659.html|144|ndxe201003| Bright light in sky then fades<n> <n><n> <n><n> At approximately 2030 hrs MST, I took my dog out for his evening walk.  As i walked into parking lot of my apartment building, I looked into the sky as I do every night.  I noticed a bright light in the sky moving due east.  I watched this bright light for about 5 minutes as it moved over the Bridger mountains between Bozeman and Livingston Montana.  While I was watching it, I was comparing it to a plane in the sky flying NW.  The plane was flying faster and at a higher altitude than the light.  The light was flying very slowly and did not have any of the standard marking lights that airliners have. (ie. red and blue wing lights and the blinking belly light)<n> <n><n> <n><n> After about five minutes or so it then faded out. I didn&#39;t see it for the rest of the walk.  When I came back inside I checked Nasa&#39;s site to see where the ISS was in comparison to my location.  It was between South America and Africa at the time.  I should also mention that the light was flying at a higher altit! ude than a Japanese flying lantern can get and the light was flying slower than a meteor.  I called my mother so she could witness the event but the light faded before she had a chance to go the an east facing window.  I was happy to have seen this event and hope to see another in the future.<n>
3/14/10 19:45|East Dundee|IL|Triangle|15-20 seconds|I clearly saw a triangle craft that glided overhead and changed the electricity of the air, but it was hard to focus on.|4/13/10|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/074/S74662.html|145|ndxe201003| I clearly saw a triangle craft that glided overhead and changed the electricity of the air, but it was hard to focus on.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was walking down the bike path when it was dark out, I was going down to the Dairy Queen to meet a friend, my ride.  On my way to the path, I saw something strange moving through the air, I could barely tell what it was and I incorrectly (or maybe correctly) thought I saw a UFO. I concluded that it was just a plane but there were more lights in the sky around. I&#39;m about 45 min from Ohare so I know that my area has some looparound flight paths near it, and there seemed to be a ton of planes circling, you could almost always see one or two along a path at any given time or place (even later at the coffee shop many miles away there were still planes everywhere in the sky.)  There may be some back up because of the weather, it seemed like a storm is brewing in the air.  But on my way down the path, I saw another light in the distance, in a different direction that seemed... out of place. Once I got to where I could see clearly, it already had enough time to leave! . I kept on walking and about five minutes later I felt something change in the air. It was like the atmosphere had changed yet I was not consciously aware of it yet. It was more like instinct that made me turn my head, and I&#39;m glad I did. I saw something strange looking come out of the area behind me and to my left. It was a collection of three lights and one blinking one. I would have thought it was another plane except it seemed different, something felt wrong about it. As it passed over me, it took about 15-25 sec to pass from the horizon to my back left to the front right, I saw what it was. It was very hard to focus on it or to look at what it was. It felt like, consciously, I could only observe my surroundings instead of rationally comprehend or pick apart details. I know what I saw but it was hard to get anything to register, I couldn&#39;t pick it apart like I could shapes in a cloud. It was hard to see but it was only a few hundred feet above me, it was triangular and! had large lobed sides. It seemed outlined in something glowin! g white or translucent but shrouded as to not be too showy. As it passed I could see that there was something on the bottom, I&#39;m not sure if it was energy pads or whatever that was the light, but I could tell it was not an airplane, it was low enough to see, but still high up. The memory is a little hard to remember of how exactly it looked, like I said, it seemed hard to focus on. As it was going into the distance I noticed it was in a new shape. The triangle seemed to turn into a T shape of disconnected lights but I never saw he conversion, only before and after. That may have been due to distance, but I do have pretty good eyesight and don&#39;t often make up shapes like that. As it passed a few hundred feet over me, it wasn&#39;t loud. It sounded like it was a jet that was much much further up, but even that sound seemed... artificial. As if it was something that would not be noticed in the background of air traffic noise, but when looked at sounded... off. And the object was much too c! lose to have normally been that quiet, if a jet was that low, car alarms would be going off and the ground rumbling. As it glided over me, for I was in the center of a very small village with noone else around as far as I could see, the hum of the electricity seemed to temporarily change. I don&#39;t remember if the frequencies got higher or lower but I remember hearing a distinct change that only happened as it was passing over the building that had neon signs. What&#39;s odd is that I tried to tell the friends I hung out with multiple times about the sighting but no matter how hard I tried, the conversation would always get wildly diverted. I tried, but I couldn&#39;t slip it in in the few hours we were at Caribou Coffee. Even when I would do my best to specifically bring it up, the person I was trying to tell, the UFO junkie, kept suddenly getting compelled to finish a thought from 20, 30 minutes earlier in conversation. I could get not get a word about that in edgewise, even though! if I blatantly said I saw a UFO we would have been talking ab! out it a ll night. As I walked home from Denny&#39;s (yes, too many different restaurants,) about a good mile from home and at the top of a hill next to which is my house in the expansive valley below it, I could see helicopters everywhere. Even If I couldn&#39;t see bright lights like I could from some of them, there was always one around. I would look into the sky and see a flash of some helicopter or something very far off, an impossible distance to identify what, but it was the artificial flash of a helicopter. They were everywhere. Cops too were hurriedly congregating, I saw three suddenly rush into a meeting place and I was walking across the street from the storage facility they met at. They got out of their cars and talked about &#34;I saw blah&#34; &#34;It was seen&#34; &#34;blah blah seen.&#34; I  couldn&#39;t really make out what they were saying, but they were all sharing about something they saw. It may have been in relation to a criminal act, but events were weird as is. (What&#39;s weird is that the UFO remi! nded me of a dream I had a while back about UFOs. I almost never have dreams about them and I know that it wasn&#39;t a real abduction, just my unconscious playing around, but it still looked similar to my abduction dream.) Oh yeah, plus there were a ton of other aircraft around, but this glided by pretty quickly and in it&#39;s own direction, not one that is a flight path. It was foggy and hazy tonight everywhere, but this was mostly below the clouds.<n>

I went back in the house and got my camera and a pair of binoculars. The object was still there when I came back and it was moving slowly in a NE direction. I figured it was a weather balloon, but decided to watch it anyway. The sphere, or circle was white and had a glow. It moved slowly for another minute and then...stopped. The sphere remained stopped for about 15 minutes in the same spot, so I had plenty of time to get photos with my digital camera(I realized it could not be a balloon since the wind would have moved it along).The object also appeared to change shape or wobble. The object was a few miles away so the shots were taken by using the zoom on my camera. There was no sound and the sphere appeared to be about 8,000 feet up. The object then changed direction and moved slowly going south and out of distance. I have two pictures. One is of the glowing sphere/circle and the o! ther shot I did not see with the naked eye.  But my digital camera picked it up.  I think as the object was changing shape, my camera caught some type of morphing or energy field in between the diffferent shapes? The sky was completely clear -- no clouds and bright blue sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

A moderatly moving cylinder-shaped object moved from West to East at about 1000 ft. up and about 1/2 mile away over the ocean.  That altitude and distance makes it difficult to approximate a size, but my guess is about 5ft in diameter and 30ft long.  The wind was very strong that day at about 15-20 knts, from the Northeast.  At first I thought it was a balloon on its side, but it was not bouncing vertically in the gusty wind.  It was quiet.  It was moving smoothly due West, against a quartering headwind that was gusty and strong.  With the West sun shining directly on it, it reminded me of a white hotwater heater flying horizontally, on its longside, with the end of it pointing toward the beach.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It continued till it came about even with Diamond Head crater, in the distance.  It appeared to stop, against the strong winds.  Then, it moved toward Diamondhead without turning.  It moved Northward with the narrow end of the cylinder leading the way.  It stopped close to Diamondhead for less than a minute, then continued West, flying broadside again.  Finally, Diamond head blocked my view of it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The flight path normally used was clear of airliners that day.  Due to the strong Northerly winds, the airliners were much farther South, landing to the North.<n>

Out of the northeastern sky a fireball appeared heading straight down for the ground. It burned with a bright green flame through a partly cloudy sky. Out of the trailing tracer behind the fireball a dart shaped craft appeared. It was silver or gray with no tail rudder and appeared to be standing still then suddenly began moving southeast perpendicular to the ground. It suddenly picked up speed and disappeared into the horizon leaving behind a light white beam-like tracer that quickly faded.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Everyone on the road and in the vicinity saw the fireball/meteorite because traffic slowed down, several people swerved to avoid hitting each other. The meteorite made the local news but I have not seen any reports of the craft that emerged from it. I&#39;m sure most were focused on the fireball because it was spectacular and the craft could have been mistaken for a low flying airplane.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have played the event back over and over in my head and the craft was definitely not an airplane, helicopter, or other known type of terrestrial aircraft. I am a chef/bartender that has lived in MS most of my life. I do not use drugs or alcohol.<n>

3/13/10 20:10|Bonita Springs|FL|Sphere|5-8 minutes|High altitude amber balls of light move across sky then appear to leave atmosphere above Bonita Springs, FL.|4/13/10|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/074/S74650.html|153|ndxe201003| High altitude amber balls of light move across sky then appear to leave atmosphere above Bonita Springs, FL.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am a 20-year-old college student, and I live in Bonita Springs, FL. I work as a waiter and a carpenter and go to school as well. I understand the skepticism regarding UFOs. I accept the existence of aliens as extremely likely, but I recognize that there are people who misidentify things they see or falsify reports for attention or other personal gains. This is where my skepticism lies; not in the subject of UFOs, but those who report them. This may seem ironic as I myself am reporting a sighting, but my hope is that this report will not be disregarded. I have neither a desire nor motive to claim to see something I did not.<n> <n><n> <n><n> That being said, I do wear contact lenses and had them in during the sighting. I was not under the influence of alcohol, tobacco, or any other drug with the exception of caffeine as I had a cup of coffee about ten minutes before the sighting occurred. What I witnessed occurred for approximately five minutes at 8:10 pm in the eastern sky. There was not a cloud in the sky and the stars were visible in all directions.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At about 8:00 pm I finished my cup of coffee and then took my dog for a walk. A couple of minutes into my walk, I saw a shooting star in the southern sky as I was about to turn left (to the east) onto another street. This got my attention, and I began to observe the night sky in hopes of possibly seeing another.  Now heading east, I continued walking, periodically scanning the sky. It was after another few minutes that I first noticed an amber ball of light, which struck me as being at a very high altitude, moving from south to north across the sky. It was about 45 degrees above the horizon at first, but then it turned to the east while slowly climbing degree by degree above the horizon, getting smaller and smaller. It appeared to me that this light had turned away from me and was gaining more and more altitude. It began to twinkle, much like a star, as it got smaller and smaller until I could no longer see it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I continued walking east down the street and checking the area of the sky for another minute until I reached the point at which I normally turn around. Seeing nothing where the light was, I turned around and began walking to the west. About a minute later I stopped and turned around and looked to the area of the sky where I had seen the amber speck of light. I observed a second moving in the same south to north fashion as the first at about the altitude. I watched it briefly until a car was coming and I turned back around. A few seconds later looked back again and could not locate the light which I attribute to a nearby street light. I continued walking west.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I checked the sky over my shoulder three more times as I walked, and on the third scan I saw a third light. It too was the same amber color as the first two, but it was moving away from me to the east, and climbing degree by degree above the horizon as it did so. I feel this was a spate light from the second as this one was more to the right (south) in the sky than the first two were. Again my impression was that this light was both gaining altitude and moving away from me, getting smaller and smaller.  There was no street light nearby, so I was able to observe this light for the longest before I could no longer see it. As it got very small, it emitted a single pulse of white light which was much larger and more intense than the amber ball itself. The ball then rapidly became extremely tiny in the sky, twinkling until I could see it off and on for a short while then not at all.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Only after the balls were gone did I notice other aircraft flying in the sky, mainly because this is when I looked for them. I saw several, all much closer to the horizon than the amber balls were, and they were all equipped with strobe and running lights. Three in particular caught my attention. They were headed to the east and appeared to by flying in a widely spaced diagonal line formation. Whether or not they were military I do not know, but that was my initial impression.<n> <n><n> <n><n> These balls of amber lights and the pulse of white light emitted by one are beyond my identification. I do not believe they were ball lightning as the sky was perfectly clear. My theory is that the lights I observed were those given off by the method of propulsion used by alien craft. This is only my best guess however, and while I do realize there may be other explanations, I could not think of one that fits to what I saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

They seemed to be in some kind of formation flying or moving at the exact same speed and height.  They would come 2 to 4 at a time in a group, then about 20 seconds later another group and so on - totalling about 30 to 40.  My husband and I and several of our neighbors witnessed this from the parking lot of the Mill Park Condominium Complex located at 7205 224th St. S.W. in Edmonds, WA.  We saw an aircraft fly by them, and it was flying quite a bit lower.  They came from about 7:30pm until around 8:00pm then stopped completely.   It was a clear night so they were easy to see.  My neighbor got a photo of this.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Eventually, a group of about 20 persons in a large apartment complex gathered to witness these movements.<n> <n><n> <n><n> First some background explanations, the witness used the term “low” to mean that the orange objects were larger than the stars in the sky, so the witness felt like they were at a lower level.  These objects were not close to ground level.  Also, the apartment complex pool is used as a reference point to describe the movement of these far. way objects The witness reported that initially 3-4 objects that looked like the color of fire were coming in “low”, moving from south to north. Then one orange circular object broke away this initial group.  This single orange object moved further north until it was seen over the apartment complex pool.  Then, after a few seconds that object disappeared. During this time, the witness said “little by little” other orange objects kept moving from the south to north, and when they got by the pool they disappeared. The approximate viewing time was said to be 15 minutes Then the sky was clear. The witness guessed there were more than 20 orange objects, but not more than 40.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Approximately 20 people in the complex saw these orange objects.  Many were out because they were smoking.  They attracted more viewers because they were saying loudly, “Look up in the sky!”.  The witness went outside because the dog was barking and upon checking outside the apartment the third time the witness saw this group of people looking orange objects in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was reported from another person in the apartment complex that the emergency phone number 911 was called. The 911 operator was reported as saying that a massive amount of calls were received from all over.  Some of the questions asked by the 911 operator were:  “Was anything burning?   Did it hit anything?  Where did it come from?”  It was also reported that the 911 operator said  that a request would be put out for cars out investigate.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The location would be approximately Lynnwood, WA.  There appeared to be a diamond pattern of lights somewhat close together and then two single lights, one off to the right of the diamond and one off to the left.  I called a friend&#39;s cell phone to see if they could see it from their location so I do have a phone record of the occurence.  After a short time period of maybe 30 seconds, the lights began to disappear one by one but all were gone within 10 seconds.  I was on my way to a small party at the home of friends and told the host about the sighting as soon as I arrived.  I must say the event was strikingly similar to those I have seen on TV shows or websites.  I am not a UFO chaser or even believer but this certainly did appear to be real to me.  I am hoping someone could corroborate my story. I did call the Lyn! nwood Police Dept to see if anyone else had reported seeing it but the person who answered the phone hadn&#39;t heard any other reports.I also scanned the local news on the chance that someone called the TV stations but didn&#39;t find anything.<n>
3/13/10 18:00|New York City (Staten Island)|NY|Sphere|half hour|Strange lights during storm in staten island|4/13/10|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/074/S74845.html|157|ndxe201003| Strange lights during storm in staten island<n> <n><n> <n><n> I currently live on staten island and have an apartment along the water with a view of brooklyn on my left and the verrazanno bridge front and center and some of the rest of the island on my right. On march 13th the weather was extremely horrible and it seemed as if staten island was in the middle of a hurricane. Heavy objects were being tossed about by the strong winds and it was very dangerous to be traveling as almost all traffic lights were malfunctioning due to the weather. It was about six o&#39;clock in the evening as i started to cook when i heard a great noise out on my balcony.  I walked over and saw my heavy metal and glass furniture being lifted and tossed about like newspaper but i looked over toward my right and saw bright flashes of lights almost like fire over toward a heavily wooded area.  My first thought was a fire must have started over there but the way the bright lights were lighting up only that part of the sky seemed weird to me.  It seemed as if something on the ground over in that direction was projecting a light towards the sky in a cone shape not a natural shape as if it was a fire. Yet the lights kinda flickered like a fire with orange, pink, white and yellow colors.  This lasted for about fifteen minutes. I was stuck in place and suddenly i saw a round object shoot directly up from the spot that the lights were coming from into what seemed like clouds or fog.  At that same moment all the lights sort of sucked into the sky where the object disappeared and then total darkness as if no light were ever over there.  Seconds later a bright blue/green light flashed in the area of the sky where the object and the lights disappeared and the blue/green color lingered for a few seconds and sort of drifted off into the clouds or fog.  I was still standing there trying to understand what i saw or was seeing when about ten minutes later a flash of lightning came pretty close to my apartment and kinda woke me up out of my trance of thinking and made me look up and the same blue/green! color w as now right above me in the sky and in a flash disappeared.  Ive been checking the internet ever since and have yet to find anyone who saw anything from that stormy saturday night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain semi-anonymous; provides no contact information.

I happened to look out the window at the exact same time that a circular green light, continuous, flew directly over my house.  It looked very close, close enough that it couldn&#39;t be a plane.  Other people have been talking about it, but saying it was a blue light.  The light I saw was definitely green, though. I only saw it for a split second.  It was anywhere from midnight to one o&#39;clock, from the twelfth to the thirteenth of March.<n>

As I looked up in that direction I saw at least 8 spheres of orange lights.  One man was attempting to film this with his digital camera (which was unsuccessful).  He was looking through the zoom lens and said they looked really big in relation the foreground.  The men present also said there had been at least 15 lights earlier but  some had already dimmed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As we watched, we saw a small plane heading south to the Ogden Airport.  The lights appeared to move up and spread out more.  They all moved in a horizontal independent motion with no sound.  One of the men who was there first stated he saw them &#34;pour out&#34; of a spot in the sky 10-12 minutes earlier.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I studied the balls of light I could see that the orange glow was of nothing like I have ever seen.  It seemed to have an organic quality with a rich color and no pulsing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> All of us felt we were being watched.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then to our amazement the lights snapped into geometric star formations.  Most of them drew into the Orion constellation.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The remainder of the spheres spread out over our heads.  When they moved in this way, we all felt uneasy, as it was such an intelligent action.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At that point all of them started to fade their color and with the naked eye you could see a dim metallic surface on the spheres like the way the dark side of the moon glows.  Within two minutes they kept fading out to be barely visible and then it was stars in their place.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Note:  There are another group of witnesses who reported this occurrence which was posted that evening.<n>

I was pretty sure they wore moving yet my husband says they were staying still. when I came home my mom asked me if I seen..<n> <n><n> <n><n> I interrupted her and said the glowing orange lights in the sky?   She said yeah and that she was talking to her boyfriend who explained he and a friend seen 6 orange lights in the shape of a pyramid that were slowly moving.  So 4 people in different spots of the same town seen the almost the same thing.  There were clouds in the sky which were brightly lit up glowing orange.

We live very close to military bases, after they went away now there are search helicopters (probably military ones) flying. We got it on video.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We called the local sheriff station and they said they and eglin airforce base are awar of the event and eglin has it under control, it was probably a flare, but flares do not just stay in one spot they go up then fall down, it was the brightest flahing lights ive ever seen in the sky<n>

We were eastbound on Hwy 98 in Destin, Fl. Having just left the restaurant which is at 21000 Emerald coast highway.  After driving about a half mile east, I happened to notice a series of lights to the north of the highway, hanging in the sky.  They were quite bright and stationary, so I thought they were probably some outdoor stadium lights.  They literally lit up the bottoms of some low clouds that were passing above them.  That’s when I realized they weren’t stadium lights, since they wouldn’t have projected upwards.  My wife also saw them and thought they were lights on top of a hill, then realized that there are no hills around here and wondered what they were.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I saw them, there were three lights, when she saw them, there were two , but then.another showed up to form a triangular light pattern, then two more showed up below and to the west of the first group.  We continued to drive east and talked about them.  At first I thought they were helicopters with their front lights on,  but as we drove along, they got neither closer nor farther away and also seemed suspended in one spot relative to one another.  Also, there was no familiar sound such as 5 helicopters would have made.  Here in Destin, helicopters are flying around all the time and there is no such thing as a silent flight of them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We continued to drive east, discussing what they might or might not be……all the time they were just hanging in the sky.  Finally we came to an intersection about two miles away at Matthew Road where I could pull off, which I did and turned into the parking lot of a service station.  I grabbed our FLIP camera, rolled down the window and started filming them.  Shortly after that, the lights began dimming, one by one, till they were gone from the sky as shown on the video.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Some observations that are not apparent from the video:  The lights were VERY bright, lighting up the bottom of the clouds more than is apparent in the video  They were absolutely stationary relative to our position, even though we drove over two miles on the ground as we observed them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The lights were also sharper and better defined than on the video.<n> <n><n> <n><n> That’s about it.  We leave the rest of it up to you.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I was parked on the street by myself waiting for my sister to come out of my mother’s house because I was picking her up. The street lights were on, and nobody was out on the street. While I was sitting there waiting for my sister to come outside, I experienced something that was very unusual and strange.  I saw everything turn pitch black and the sky turn into a bright light. I know it doesn’t sound like something out of the ordinary but trust me it was. I keep replaying it in my head and it just doesn’t make any sense to me. The best way that I can describe it is like a sudden and instant flash.  The thing that made me wonder if it could be linked to something abnormal is because when the incident was occurring I saw the sky and it was like nothing like I have ever seen before.  The whole entire sky turned as if it were daylight for a split second, while everything else was blackened.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After the incident happened, I kept replaying it over my head and tried to make logical sense out of it, but nothing seemed to add up.  Then I started to look around me to see if anyone else saw what I had just seen, but there was not a soul.  Since I was on my own, it did cross my mind that perhaps it was my imagination but then my sister came out about a minute later and casually asked me if I had seen a flash or if it was just her.  Without me even mentioning anything to her.  When she asked me that, I knew that it wasn’t my imagination anymore, it was far more than that and that this actually did happen.  I am just confused on what I did see because it was honestly something very strange and unusual.  I am not trying to conclude that this can be something related to aliens but I am curious to know if you guys can give me any sort of information regarding this.<n>

They were probably a couple of miles from me at the time.  I turned around and drove a 1/4 of a mile back to my brothers house where him and his daughter was in their front yard watching it. I asked him wasn&#39;t it moving away from us and he agreed.  It was moving due south. I was in my truck most of the time so couldn&#39;t hear anything, and when I asked Him he couldn&#39;t hear any noise, so we were sure it wasn&#39;t airplanes or helicopters.  Somewhere around 30-40 minutes after we lost sight of it he called me back and said he and his daughter seen 3 lights appear, in the direction where we lost sight of it, and then go out come back on again and out again for the last time.  I would like to know if anyone else seen anything similar around the same time?<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous.  PD))<n>

Then a few seconds later the object Stopped emitting the light and the light started up again but it jumped in the sky the. left and right before going blank to no lights.  Me and my wife came upon were the object was about 1 Mile up buffalo Road at the intersection of buffalo Rd and McClelland Ave.  We seen two red lights side by side hovering in the air without any noise or movement then a 3 light that was white appeared and the view of a giant triangle took place.  While my wife was driving I opened up the sunroof and we drove under the craft.  It was Amazing seeing something odd and big Without any noise.  We passed under the object and about 30 seconds went by and the lights were gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thank you for your time and I hope More people come forward with information.<n>

I am an amateur stargazer so my eyes are always to the sky. As I looked to the North I noticed a bright light moving across the sky, I would say about 40 degrees or so off the horizon. It was moving from West to East, inside the atmosphere. No flashes, no strobing, just a single white light, much brighter than any stars in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After watching for about 30 seconds, I had determined that is clearly not a plane or a satellite. I couldn&#39;t believe my eyes, I ran to the front door and got my mother. She couldn&#39;t believe her eyes. We continued to watch for about another minute as it seemed to travel in short spurts (like an inch across the sky to the naked eye, if that makes sense). It continued on and seemed as if it just suddenly got bright and seemed to be stationary for a brief second and then slowly faded away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> While watching all this 2 planes passed into our sites, so we could easily compare them to an airplane. My mother also is a stargazer and we used to look for satellites in the sky together when I was a child. I am now 32 and she is 55. I am also a full-time college student (as well, as I just completed a quarter in Astronomy), part-time risk engineer assistant and a single mother of 2 toddlers. my mother is a registered nurse.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We are both sober, intelligent adults. I guess you could consider my mother a skeptic, she was quite amazed and really could not give an explaination for what she saw, nor could I. I am far from a skeptic and have had other experiences in the past. This is the first time I&#39;ve been able to share the phenomon with someone else. I hope someone else out there saw it too.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I looked out the window (left) and saw a non-reflective, black rod hovering in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> While I can’t tell you exactly how far away it was, it was definitely close enough to easily determine that it was a 3-dimensional shape (rod) that was completely stationary (at an angle) and at a slightly lower altitude than our plane.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I looked down at the ground in the area and saw absolutely nothing but bare, unoccupied land.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I immediately began pointing it out to others around me who had no problem seeing it.  After observing it for roughly 2 minutes, our plane maneuvered sharply to the right (away from the object) without warning.  It was not our final approach, and none of the airline staff said anything.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((COPIES OF CORRESPONDENCE WITH SOURCE OF REPORT))<n> <n><n> <n><n> Dear Ms. Evenson,<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thank you very much for the excellent report, and for the nice illustration<n> <n><n> <n><n> Do you happen to know any of the other witnesses?  If so, we would very much<n> <n><n> like to have them prepare reports of what they recall about the incident.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Also, did the object happen to travel along with the aircraft, or did it<n> <n><n> seem to be stationary?<n> <n><n> <n><n> What type of aircraft were you in, please?

I ask because your<n> <n><n> report seems to me to have been written by someone who is familiar with<n> <n><n> aviation.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((Paragraph deleted.))<n> <n><n> <n><n> Again, thank you very much for having shared the information with our<n> <n><n> Center, and for having taken the time to compose such a nice report!!<n> <n><n> <n><n> Cordially,<n> <n><n> <n><n> Peter Davenport, Director<n> <n><n> National UFO Reporting Center<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((END MESSAGE))<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((BEGIN RESPONSE FROM WITNESS))<n> <n><n> <n><n> Mr. Davenport,<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;m glad that my crude illustration was at least somewhat helpful, haha!<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was just a passenger on the plane (ex.: 737), but I&#39;m familiar with some aviation terminology/procedures because of my brother (12+ yrs of Flight Simulator, and now aviation school).  My plane ticket for that trip was sent to me via e-mail, so I was able to go back and get the precise details of the flight.  I thought this could be useful in case there were other reports of the incident that I didn&#39;t know about.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Unfortunately, I didn&#39;t get contact information from the other witnesses.  As odd as it sounds, I think I was too preoccupied(?) with trying to piece together what I/we had just seen to consider needing to reach them in the future.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As for the object itself, it did remain stationary from what I could tell.  That&#39;s what led me to look at the ground because I figured this thing had to be attached to something.  It was not.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Important Note!!!!: (I feel like SUCH an idiot for not including this crucial detail before)<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was so much turbulence throughout the entire flight that all of the passengers and crew had to remain seated/buckled in (I remember that vividly because I was really regretting not using the bathroom prior to boarding).  Even though the turbulence was more or less constant, the pilot(s) would still announce whenever we were moving into an area where it would be more intense.  So, given that  every occupant of the plane was seated, they were able to safely maneuver in the way I described (this was not a gentle, gradual turn).  The fact that they didn&#39;t alert us prior to doing so (like they had been the whole flight) is what leads me to believe that it was in direct response to the UFO.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Again, I apologize for not reporting it sooner.  It wasn&#39;t until something jarred my memory yesterday that I realized this was something you guys might want to know about!<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((Line deleted)), and do not hesitate to ask me any questions.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thank you,<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((END CORRESPONDENCE))<n>

I will attempt to take photographs and soil samples of the blackened areas in the near future.  My best non-UFO explanation is some sort of magnesium ammonium phosphate ignition for some unknown reason.<n>

There was a series of 3-4 high intensity flashes that resembled a lighting strike at very close proximity without any sound at all being generated from this flash of light.  The light was temporarily blinding and possibly led to a short term failure of power and electronics.  During this time of silence there was also an increased outside activity from animals such as Dogs, Possums, Deer that also seemed dazed and cunfused by this strange light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After 15 minutes or so radios and cell phone coverage started to work again.<n>

When I looked up I saw one big bright light with multiple smaller lights surrounding it (they all were the color yellowish orange, resembles a street light), a couple of seconds later the vanished. There was no sounds coming for the lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We went inside got my cousin and decided to head out of town to see if we could find anything else.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 7:48pm- When heading out of town I look out my window and notice another bright big light and a smaller one shot out of it. I informed everyone then a hill blocked our veiw. After we pasted the hill the lights were gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 7:53pm- We pull over the car appoximately 10-15 miles out of town, and notice 3 bright lights. They were there for about 3 seconds and faded out quickly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 7:58pm- Noticed small red lights flying around then seconds afterwards 3 lights appear above town east from us.  They all appeared at different times, all same color shape and size. Two of the were right above the town and the third one was further away.  Then about 3 seconds after they all appeared the faded out at different times.  They did this 3-4 times before all dissappeared. Once again we see small red lights, but this time they were heading south west.  They stayed the same distance apart the whole time they were in view.  We had the windows rolled down and didn&#39;t hear any noise at all.<n>

These lights were about 500 feet in the sky and only a few blocks down from where we were standing. The lights were next to each other and the one in the middle was the biggest.  About 5 seconds after I initially saw the lights two of them separated from the middle and disappeared, then the middle one dissappeared.  The lights appeared to be heading west.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After telling my friend what we saw, we decided to take a drive out of town to the west to see if we could see anything.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 7:48 pm- Heading west, a bit past the golf course we saw one big bright light then a smaller light separated from it. The lights were to the south. After we drove past a hill that blocked our view the light was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 7:53- After finding a place to pull over on the highway me, my friend, and my girlfriend all saw three bright lights in the sky about 500 feet high to the east. They showed up one by one and faded away one by one. They were only there for about 3 seconds. Two lights were somewhat next to eachother and one was off in the distance.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 7:58 pm- Three bright lights show up one at a time to the east. They were visible for about 5 seconds and then faded away one by one.  After all of them had faded away they started to reappear and fade away again for around 10 to 15 seconds then disappeared for good.  After the bright lights were gone we noticed two smaller red lights flying in the same general area.  None of the lights made any sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We have some video footage but the quality is pretty poor. You can at least tell that lights showed up and disappeared in the sky where no lights were originally at…<n>

I of course panicked, and then when it turned, and I noticed the underside, which had a red light on the back, which came to a point, similar to a triangle, I pulled out my cell phone and took a picture just before it went over the houses towards Wal-Mart and Mt. Holly Springs.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The picture I took is at http://i187.photobucket.com/albums/x262/gothghost2/Locked/ufo.jpg and shows the large red light, several smaller red lights that were on the side, and one of the large, round white lights on the front. The picture is bad quality because it’s dark, but the lights on the object were very bright and can be seen somewhat clearly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have no clue what this thing was, but there is an Army War College in town and a nearby Navy Depo., however this didn’t seem to be military made seeing as how it was maybe only as high as a ten story building and seemed to smoothly hover, did not make noise, and was extremely large.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was a school bus outside of the YMCA that had lost all of its internal and external lights and power, but I’m not sure if it’s connected or not, as nothing else lost power.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

They were moving from south-east to north-west in a straight line one behind the other seperated by a space, four of them in the first group and the fifth and last about thirty seconds behind.<n> <n><n> There was no sound that could be heard, and they had an amber colored light on the under side that was going from dim to bright, the light was about the same color as amber colored sodium street lights. I could not see any shape of them just the lights.  It was a cloudy over cast night, the were below the cloud cover.  Latitude 38.811582, longitude 90.880516<n>

I asked my friends if they were seeing it as well, and they were.  The lights stayed in one spot for three nights now, and didn&#39;t move at all.  At first I assumed it was a satellite, but tonight as I was looking directly at them, they just vanished WAIT, they were gone for maybe ten minutes as i started writing this, but now they&#39;re back in the exact same spot as before but there&#39;s a light shining down from the bottom of it.  A beam of light if you will. I have cold chills telling that actually.  The lights just vanished.  They flashed from a red to white to sometimes green. The red was very dominant though.  I sat outside and looked up at it for like I said three nights without them moving one time.  The lights were coming from over a hill so I also ruled that it was a cell tower maybe, but after I tought about that I realized that there was no cell towers of any kind in that direction.<n>

These lights left a trail which lasted for 3 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The &#39;balls&#39; moved at high speed through the air, making turns without having to slow down.  The ufo&#39;s seemed to be interested in something in the forest.  It almost seemed like they didn&#39;t understand it, because they kept scanning the same tree, up and down, for some time, but kept returning to the same spot as if they were in a loop.  It didn&#39;t seem like they got the information they wanted.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.  PD))<n>

What was most peculiar was the movement and speed the several objects were far enough away to discenr move mention but not shape these later we all attributed to fighter planes.  However the Larger shapes were comprised of 3 red lights on each corner and a relitivly bright central light.  These together might be exsplained away except that the g forces required to move the way the lager ones were moving would most likely implode a human.  Were talking of horizon to horizon in the space of a few seconds and several smaller craft at intersecting points of it&#39;s travel firing off 10 round tracers as if to intercept the other much larger crafts this went on for about 45 minutes of what we caught, but the arial maneuvers were phenomenal.  It was one of those things that if you just took a minute and concentrated on your visual you would have been able to discern movement they blended in with stary background &#34; almost&#34; flawlessly.<n>

At about 2:40 a.m., I saw a strange light that fell from the sky and disappeared into the treeline on the right side of the highway some distance ahead of me.  The light was bright white at first and then, as it neared the trees, turned to a bright yellow-green color, then disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I could not pinpoint where the light disappeared, but it seemed to be in the area between Brocktown Road and Meadows Road to the east of Hwy.16.  Thinking the object might have been a meteorite, and therefore hot enough to spark a woods fire, I drove out part of Brocktown Road and all of Meadows Road in an attempt find the landing spot.  However, I did not find any sign of the light, nor did I see any smoke or flame.  An email to the local AM radio disc jockey (who mentioned the sighting to listeners that morning) received no responses, the DJ told me.<n>
3/10/10 00:45|Anaheim|CA|Disk|5 seconds|Flying Saucer Seen Cruising Over I-5 Near Anaheim Late at Night|4/13/10|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/074/S74619.html|186|ndxe201003| Flying Saucer Seen Cruising Over I-5 Near Anaheim Late at Night<n> <n><n> <n><n> A low-flying aircraft of a round, saucer-like shape was seen flying north alongside the I-5 south in Anaheim after midnight on Tuesday night as I was driving home to San Diego from Los Angeles. My peripheral vision picked up a low-flying airplane above the freeway, which caught my interest. As I looked to examine it, I noticed it was not an airplane but a darkly-colored (black or dark grey) saucer-shaped object that was moving at what seemed to be a low speed and at what seemed to be a low altitude. It was difficult to tell, as my car was moving past it at 70 mph in the opposite direction, but the craft appeared to be travelling somewhere between 40-70 mph, going north, and only a few hundred feet off the ground.  This would have made the object itself a bit smaller than an airplane, although it is too difficult to estimate a size. What was then even more interesting was a blue light that emitted from the side wall of the craft, moving in a circle around the ! craft, looking a bit like a reflection from a glass wall, but perhaps coming from within the craft. It was then that I really thought I&#39;d seen a U.F.O.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had never seen one before, and I still have my doubts about this one.  The craft was spotted in a densely populated urban area, not far from Disneyland and many other world-famous entertainment spectacles, and it may simply have been coming from or going to one of those places.  But for the five seconds I had to witness it, the craft truly did not look human to me. Many more people saw the object I&#39;m sure, and so I made this report to see if anyone else who saw it also was taken aback by its curiosities.<n>

I saw in the sky an extremely large round craft with lights protruding out from the sides.  The lights were yellow, red, and blue.  It was very low, maybe about three tree lenghts high. And it made no sound.  It was moving towards Missoula and I passed underneath it.  There were two other same shaped crafts behind it higher up in the sky.  When I got off the exit at Huson, I spotted another one that looked like the others.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

As I continued to admire the object a green light then became visible. The object red and green lights were located at the extreme ends, and appeared to be normal aircraft lights. I thought it was a helicopter because of them.  Then mulitiple white lights began began to flash and it moved laterally side to side very rapidly and then I called my mom to come out see what I was looking at.  The object hoovered still for a few more moments then repeated the same action and lights on the object went off.  It became a silvery white hazy color and sped of at an amazing amoutn of speed towards the northeast and stopped and hoovered again the red, green and white lights never came on again but the object still glowed(so to speak). about 15 seconds later the sped off into the sky again at an incredible speed into the sky.<n>

I stopped at a STOP sign when I saw what I first thought was a large aircraft but realized it was much too large to be an aircraft.  I originally thought it was going to crash into a house because it seemed to drop quickly out of the sky, but it stopped directly above/in front of me and hovered about 75 feet in the air.  It was very bright white lights with one area of red light.  I pulled my car over to get a better look and when I looked up again, the object was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC NOTE:  Witness indicates that date of the sighting is approximate.

The first sighting was September 2009.  This time the craft was cylindrical in shape, like a cigarette, with a black vertical stripe in the middle.  It was traveling slowly in the westerly direction, as I was traveling eastbound on Schoenersville Road in Bethlehem.  I noticed the shape coming towards me in the sky as I sat in my car at a red light.  As it came into view I realized that it was not a jet flying at a high altitude, but a substantially smaller craft.  It moved slowly above the building to my left, and my son made a comment about the shape of the craft.  It was a bright silver chrome, and it shone in the sun.  It was a sunny day with a blue sky and no low-lying clouds or fog.  The traffic light changed and I continued driving until it was out of sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Then the object appeared to start changing shape the lights started moving from edge to center still spinning counter clockwise.  I held my hand up to try to judge the size touching my thumb to my index finger (making an ok jester) the object fit in there (probably the size of a fifty cent piece).  I reached back to open the door and yelled for my wife to come out.  She did, but the lights were already out of her sight, I could still see them, and it made a 90degree turn directly west.  I could no longer see it because trees were obstructing my view.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

At first I thought it was a meteor, then I saw it again (just a flash).  I saw the flash about 9 times and about one minute apart for about 15 minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I could not tell if it was moving because they were only flashes and appeared to stay in the same spot.  At one point I got my binoculars to see a little better.  It seemed to be up above the level planes fly.  I know satellites move but this was no satellite.  Meteors wouldn’t stay in the same spot.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Do you have any idea what that could have been?  Any input from you would be appreciated.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thanks<n>

It banks to the east and slowly heads away.  Speed wise it was moving about half of what the commercial jets in the area  appeared to be.

It obscured the stars behind it in a circular form, and had what appeared to be two lights on either side, it moved swiftly and silently, and appeared to be flying very low. I moved my head and checked lighting inside the car to confirm it was not a reflection on the glass (it wasn&#39;t).  The object was headed towards the ocean.<n>

Al principio pense que era algun proveedor o quizá hasta los dueños, abri las puertas y me acerque a la zona de estacionamiento cuando vi a ese objeto con forma de gusano flotando muy cerca del piso, muy grande, silencioso, brillante y con movimientos extraños.  Me quede observando el objeto y rápidamente se fue.  Le avise al vigilante de la planta y no me creyó.

I immediately said, ((deleted)), look a shooting star and i saw her smile at first but then when it stopped we both were shocked. the ball of light got a little brighter then changed direction and shot into outer space with a white trail behind it at an unimaginable speed and not once did it make a sound. my jaw literally dropped and my girlfriend face was in shock with a gasp that you only hear when you are surprised beyond belief. it was so bright that it not only caught our eye at the same time but we think the 2 cars behind us also. the reason i say this is because after the six seconds we watched this thing shoot in and then leave, i had to be sitting at that traffic light for about another 10 seconds....and anyone in the north jersey area can tell you ! people around here have zero patience when it comes to sitting at a green traffic light....and not one horn was blown at me during this time. It was so crazy that i had to pull over shortly after leaving the traffic light because i was literally shaking. i felt confused, scared, LIED TO, and relieved all at the same time.  Even my friends who are all skeptics about everything, Especially UFO&#39;s, Ghosts, etc., even they admitted that my story sounds crazy, but to have an eye witness who was sitting right next to me who&#39;s story matched exactly, overwhelmed even them. the part that really puts an image that they cant help but to feel something is the part about how it shot into outer space with the white trail following. the best way to describe it is someone hitting homerun with a lightbulb into the air at a million miles per hour , and it never came down nor made a sound.<n>

It was a perfectly clear evening sky.  Low on the horizon I saw two planes due west crossing one anothers flight paths preparing to land.<n> <n><n> <n><n> From slightly below and to the right of Sirius, I saw an unbroken arc of dull white light shaped like a two humped camel&#39;s back move on a 45 degree angle toward earth&#39;s surface.  This entire event took place in approximately two seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It reminded me of search lights at a store grand opening that bounce off clouds, except there were no clouds.  This did not appear to be the outline of any type of craft, rather the leading edge of an incredibly large fast moving light source.<n>

At first I thought it was a bright star, but it was much bigger (closer) and couldn&#39;t have been.  It seemed to be moving further away when all of a sudden 2 smaller orange lights came from under it, like teardrops, one, and then the other right behind it.  The object did this again a minute later, dropping two &#34;teardrop lights&#34; from it.  I&#39;ve never seen anything quite like it, and there were other witnesses.  The object ended up floating into the distance beyond sight.  I don&#39;t know what this is, and would like some feedback if anyone does know what I might have seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I slowed down quite a bit to observe the light across the field.  As I watched it, it quickly flashed yellow, white, red, a pinkish tint of red, then back to orange.  I thought this was very odd so I hurried home and turned down the unpaved road which I live on.  When I turned down the road, the light was still high in the sky but a little lower then before (the color of the light was still orange). I decided to flash my high beams at it.  I flashed my lights three times. I then noticed the object flashed at me once or twice but still remained the same color orange.  This really startled me.  I got home and the light was behind my house and extremely low in the sky (about the height a helicopter would be at to view a police pursuit). I told my dad about it and he came out to see it.  We were looking at it through th! e trees and he also thought it was strange.  So he went back inside to put his shoes on.  As he went in, the light flashed yellow for about 3 seconds, then back to a really bright orange.  He came back outside and we observed it for about 20 minutes.  Then it slowly turned red and then the light went off for about 5 seconds.  Then at that time it was noticed the craft was a metallic looking sphere.  Then the red light returned on the craft.  It still remained stationary, then as we looked right over our heads a different white light (which looked like a normal airplane from a distance) passed slowly over our heads making no noise what so ever.  It only had one white light on the bottom of the craft  (There was no red or green lights on the craft like you would see on a normal airplane)  Compared to the craft with the red light, it moved perpendicular across the sky. As the white light craft flew off from west to east.  We focused our attention back to the red light craft. Now the red ! light craft was moving in our direction. Then it stopped once again.  It then flew in random patterns very slowly.  Then it seemed to stop moving.  We continued observing it until it sank below the tree line and was no longer visible.<n>

The large ship disappeared within 4-5 minutes, with the smaller crafts remaining for approximately 5 more minutes.  My husband and I both observed these, and when we went to work that night, we started to tell a co worker, and he stopped us, and described the same observance and time frame as we did.  He lives about 30 miles from us.<n>

There were 3 in one group, 4 in another group, and about 10 that I could count in another group. The 3 groups were flying one on top of another and would all come together and then spread out. The group of 10 made a v-shape, and then a u-shape. They would quickly come very close together, appearing as though they were on top of each other, and then spread out again. I could distinctly see that they were not planes or jets. When they turned on their side it was very clear they were disk shaped. They were silver and very bright. They flew over to the left of me, towards where I live( I was in the Lowe&#39;s parking lot next door to my neighborhood). I quickly called my son and told him to run outside. He and his friend ran out and saw the group of 10 objects. He also said they were silver a! nd disk shaped from his view as well. The objects began flying back my way, where we watched them for a while before some disappeared. At this point there were 6 left, and they split into 3 groups of 2 each. They made a circle formation, and then flew off to the right where they made a straight line. A plane (or jet) came from the south and flew directly into the line of objects where they began disappearing until there were only 2 left, and then there was only one. It seemed to fly more quickly away until I could no longer see it. The sky was very clear at the time with no clouds. I have never witnessed anything like this ever before. It was unlike anything I have seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

This occurrence happened somewhere between Moses Lake and Othello (Washington).  I can&#39;t remember the exact location.  My Sister and I were on our way to Othello to pick up a dog that I had adopted. It was about 11:00 a.m..  As we were driving we were engaged in conversation.  On the left side of the road, approximately 50 feet in from the edge of the roadway, an incredibly intense blue light appeared.  The intensity was that of an arc welder, but  was about the size of a dumpster.  It had a distinct shape also. I continued talking to my Sister, but was mesmerized by this light.  As I got closer, it began to diminish, fade, and eventually vanished. All the while, I&#39;m trying to process in my mind what light was.  I finished my sentence, then paused for a moment.  Then my Sister asked &#34;did you see that&#34;?  I replied &#34;the blue light?&#34;&#34;Yes!&#34; she said, &#34;what the hell was that?&#34;  I had no clue, but we both had seen it.  When we g! ot to where the light was, there was nothing but an empty field.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A week later we were discussing it with my Sister&#39;s husband.  That&#39;s when I asked her if she noticed a shape of the light.  She drew a picture, and was almost identical to the one I had drawn.<n> <n><n> <n><n> To this day, we still have no logical explanation of what we saw.  We can&#39;t exactly call it a UFO because it wasn&#39;t flying.  The intensity and shade of blue are beyond description.<n>

It stopped in mid air about 2-3 miles south of me at the top of the ridge and then it slowly descended into the woods.   I dont know what I saw but it sure scare the living jeepers out of me.<n>

It was a really clear night, so there were a lot of stars in the sky, but the one directly in front of me was the brightest, so it caught my attention. as I watched it kind of pulsate, all the sudden it just disappeared...like the light just blinked out. I thought maybe a cloud had covered it for a second, so I sat there for another 5 minutes or so, but it never did reappear. don&#39;t know exactly what it was, but being such a clear night, it makes me wonder<n>

Purple, Green, Red, Blue. in what order of the colors i cannot say. !0 minutes later it seemed that it had leveled flat and a row of lights could be seen through the telescope.  After that i witnessed it looking as if it was doing ariel flips but not moving in any direction.

I noticed what I thought were plane lights untinl I saw a beam of green light come from it and it was not moving.  I came in the house and told my mom and son to come outside.  My sister called and I told her about it and she came over and we watched it for a good 45min and I watched it my self about 45 min.  We looked through binoculars and could see differnt colored lights on it.  After we watched for awhile we notice 3 more.  The one we were watching started moving out towards the Cresthill Joliet area. My  son and I decided to go and seen where it was going. We whent down rt.53 to Division St. and we could see this very very bright light.  We crossed over Weber Rd. the closer we got to it the brighter the light got it was almost blinding. We crossed over Gaylord Rd. and we were by a warehouse, I turned down the street and stopped so we could see this thing. My son and I could see the bottom of ! it it hovered above us.  It ws triangle shaped it had red large circulat lights on the botom and you could see all of these colored lights around it. I have never seen any thing like it in my life, I also had the window down so I could get a picture of it and I also did not hear any sound from it. As quickly as I took the picture it took off.  I have seen more of them around here for the last several days and I did take a video and some pictures.<n>

I slammed on the brakes, reversed to where I could observe and studied the item.  It was a series of star shaped (with possibly six or eight points) arranged in a circle hence my original thought that it was a starburst-type circle.  I stuck my arm out fully and with my thumb up found it to be about the size of my thumb from the knuckle up.  I observed for about four minutes.  The object/light or item never moved nor changed color or brilliance. I have lived in this neighborhood for nearly seven years and know the geography and landmarks fairly well.  There is no radio tower or any solid object in that direction.  I could only poorly estimate it&#39;s altitude as about 1000 feet but that&#39;s difficult.   It was blue-white in colo!r.  I drove off to get to my destination reminding myself to return in a half-hour and observe again.  I forgot to do that.  Later tonight (03/06/10) I will return to that locale to check again.<n>

When I first saw this light, I would estimate it was over Hood Canal.  As the light moved east, I compared the brightness of it to the surrounding stars and it was brighter than the brightest stars in my field of vision.  It literally looked like a star but was moving 2-3 times faster than a commercial jet would appear to be traveling at cruising altitude.  I also looked for any flashing lights around the white light and did not see any.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I quickly stepped back in the house and asked my wife to come outside to see this light.  I stepped out side again and the light began to fade quickly.  My wife did not make it outside fast enough to see it.  The light went from bright white to undetectable in about 3 seconds.  At that point, I would estimate this object was over Puget Sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I could not judge the altitude except to say it seemed to be at least 30 thousand feet overhead.  It was very quite outside and I did not hear any sound coming from this light as I would have had it been a jet airplane.<n>

3/5/10 21:00|Kihei|HI|Circle|15 minutes|6 yr-old daughter and Mom spotted 4 spaceships in a large cloud on a clear Hawaii night.|4/13/10|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/074/S74567.html|225|ndxe201003| 6 yr-old daughter and Mom spotted 4 spaceships in a large cloud on a clear Hawaii night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was driving south at approximately 8:45 PM on March 5, 2010, and my 6-yr-old daughter was in the passenger seat, singing a song. Suddenly she stopped singing and because of the sudden quiet she emitted, as a Mom, it sort of startled me. But I was driving on a busy highway and concentrated on the road instead of attending to her. After about 10 seconds she finally expressed a sound (she&#39;d been staring intently out the window). She said: &#34;Oh, wow&#34; or something similar and that she was watching a UFO!   Of course my initial reaction was to totally dismiss it, like she was being childish and I told her there was no such thing, it was just twinkling in the stars.  In Hawaii, of course, the clear night sky is utterly spectacular and pristine. I never glanced in her direction and we talked about space for the remainder of the ride.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We pulled into our apartment complex&#39;s parking lot, about 5-10 minutes later and we both got out of the car.  I still needed to get my 2 yr-old out of the car, who was sitting in a car seat in the back, but something made me look up in the sky first.  The sky was completely sparkling clean with no clouds.   Directly above us I saw a large cloud with a bunch of multiple dancing lights inside, as if someone was projecting a light show into a cloud.  My 6 yr-old can describe it more accurately since she watched it longer than I did. I couldn&#39;t believe what I saw.  It didn&#39;t make any logical sense. A lot of my mental energy went into attempting to process the meaning of it all, as I was watching it.  The only possible explanation I could think of, was that a big light show was happening on the beach about 100 feet below me and being projected into a cloud.  The lights were dancing quickly and there were many lights, like a show.  The only other answer was that it was a UFO.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My 6 yr-old&#39;s description, is better since I needed to attend to my 2 yr-old abruptly:  She said it was 3 to 4 circles of lights (like a craft) in the transparent cloud (the cloud reminded me of the material a ghost would be made out of, invisible, yet, not invisible).  When my daughter initially saw the thing in the car she said the circles, were dancing around in circles really fast, going first, clockwise and then, counter clockwise, in rhythmic motion.  Later, when we saw it in the parking lot, the lights changed movement and direction: blinking sort of haphazardly but with purpose, not clumsy, and not going in just circles any more and they were &#34;dancing&#34; quickly.  To me, &#34;dancing lights&#34; fits well because the &#34;feeling&#34; I received was that of a kind of rhythmic motion and almost celebratory, as if a light &#34;show&#34; was taking place. My daughter saw the lights as: about, 4 circular crafts, with fast blinking lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Neither my daughter nor I could &#34;believe&#34; what we saw, we kept rubbing our eyes to see if our vision was messed up, but it wasn&#39;t, it was real!   I&#39;d turned to retrieve my 2-yr-old daughter out of the car and proceeded to discard of some rubbish in a nearby trash can, and the thing had totally dematerialized! My 6 yr-old hadn&#39;t seen it vanish, either, for she had looked away momentarily, too.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The weirdest disappearing aspect, was the fact, the wispy cloud the lights had been projecting from, was gone, as well.  Not a trace of a cloud was left in the sky.<n>

After about two minutes silence she slowly muttered a statement such as, “Oh wow” and expressed she saw the blinking lights of alien spaceships in the sky! I was on a busy highway so I didn’t glance her way.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Of course my reaction was disbelief and we spoke of stars and such for the remainder of our 5-10 minutes drive home.<n> <n><n> <n><n> East of our home lies an extinct volcano with a prominent observatory and to the west, the ocean, while we live in a small urban area. The sky was crystal clear, a typically pristine and cloudless Hawaiian evening, yet, when she and I hopped out of the car (it is a large outdoor parking lot), I spotted in the sky, a lone, transparent cloud hovering about 30 feet above us. As far as I can tell, no one else is around. I see around 30-50 lights moving and blinking and “dancing” very quickly inside of the cloud. Both of us rub our eyes wondering if our vision is messed up. The cloud is maybe the size of a small, one story home and doesn’t move but the lights are bouncy and wild, like we were watching a light show, but nothing I could imagine projected the lights, onto the solo cloud, from below; it was absolutely illogical. I viewed it for maybe 2 or 3 minutes and it “felt” “celebratory”.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My daughter studied the phenomena in the car for 10 minutes, and described it as 4 round spaceships that initially rotated super fast, clockwise and then, counterclockwise. One of the discs stood apart, however and didn’t move like the others. The 3 disc’s movement altered from circular to a more randomness, when we were in the parking lot. She also explained the cloud with ships, didn’t have a “top” (lid) to it. I’m not certain if she meant the cloud or the ships or both. As I was looking at it, my feeling wasn’t of fear at all.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My 2 yr-old needed to be retrieved from the car so I decided to attend to her and then watch the strange cloud after I gathered up my baby, but in a manner of about a minute the entire thing had vanished. My six year-old had been looking away, too, so missed its disappearance. I told her it was an “angel” so she wouldn’t be afraid, and every trace of lights and ghost-like cloud substance, dematerialized within under a minute.<n>

3/5/10 18:45|Phoenix|AZ|Other|5 minutes|Black object hovering over central Phoenix|4/13/10|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/074/S74556.html|231|ndxe201003| Black object hovering over central Phoenix<n> <n><n> <n><n> While walking my dog at about 6:40 or 6:45 pm on Friday, March 5th, 2010, I observed what I initially thought was a helicopter or balloon in the twilight blue sky directly and westward above me in north central Phoenix.  However, after I stopped walking to get a better look at the object, I realized that it wasn&#39;t moving, but rather drifting ever so slowly, and at times, it would remain stationary.  I stood staring at the object for a number of minutes trying to decipher what it was that I was looking at.  I thought to myself, is that a balloon?  I just couldn&#39;t figure out what it was that I was looking at.  It was just a sizable black object high in the sky, about the size of an aircraft, but shapeless.  It didn&#39;t make a noise, or have any lights, but it did seem to have a whitish hue or ambience to it at times.  After a number of minutes staring at the sky, I said to myself, I must look ridiculous, so I decided to move on, not to mention that my dog was ge! tting very impatient.  I probably wouldn&#39;t have thought much more about it, but what happened next is what dictated that I report it.  I looked away for only a second or two, probably took three or four steps, and then glanced back up at it, but it was gone.  It simply disappeared.  I immediately stopped again and stared in disbelief.  It was nowhere to be seen.  There were planes flying all over the place, but no black object.  I searched the sky for a number of minutes, but it was gone.  That&#39;s when I started to question the reality of what I just witnessed.  What did I see?  There has to be a rational explanation.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

At first seemed like an illusion, although clearly seen by 3 people.  Not much aerial activity, was going in a straight path.  One object was sighted during that time.  All three decided the object was not a plane, the object made no noise.

I stayed at my sister’s apartment while my car was being fixed last week.  On Friday, I got my car out of the shop but decided to stay at my sister’s to watch movies.  However, first I wanted to come home to feed my dogs and wash clothes.  These would take some time as I live deep in the country in Arkansas, near Memphis.  It usually takes me at least 15 mins. to reach my house from my sister’s apartment.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I came home around 5-5:30, during dusk, and noticed this weird shape in the sky that did not move.  I didn’t think about it for long due to the fact it was kind of far away.  I came home, did my chores, and left for my sister’s apartment.  After watching movies (2012 and Zombieland), I started for home around 1 in the morning.  As I got closer to my house, I realized there was this strange light in the sky around a field.   Once again, I didn’t really pay attention.  I thought it was a lamppost.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I rounding the third curve, I saw the light right above the field near the Waverly Gin.  This really freaked me out.  I was the only car on the road, in the country, near a field.  I thought for sure this thing was a helicopter, crop duster, you know just trying to rationalize what I was seeing.  When I got to the curve where the Gin and field were, I started to slow down.  As I slowed, I literally saw a disk like shape with one light, like a flood, search light looking-thing, and two red lights on the side.  I rolled the window down to hear, you know, if this was a helicopter or what, and I heard nothing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I seemed to be hovering over a line of trees about 100 feet away.  When I slowed down, I sat there for about 30 seconds to figure out what this thing was.  As I sat there, I started to see it coming closer to me.  I freaked out and tried to get as far away as possible from this thing.  It started to follow me and did so for about a mile.  I started to look at the clock and at the road, a little back and forth motion, to make sure I was still at the right time.  I remember the time was 1:45 the last time I looked at the clock in the car.  After I rounded curve number 5, I was no more than a few hundred feet from my house and looked in the review mirror, out the sun roof, and both side mirrors and saw nothing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I pulled up to my house, the next thing I noticed was the neighbor’s outdoor lights didn’t come on when my dogs ran into his yard barking insanely.  So that started to weird me out.  I sat in the car for 5 mins. looking everywhere I could outside my car to see if something was around, above, behind, or anywhere near.  I got out and tried to peek above the trees to see if I could see whatever it was I had just encountered.  I saw nothing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> For the past two nights I have been freaked out whenever I drive home because whatever it was a I saw was not a plane.<n>
3/5/10 00:20|Tacoma|WA|Fireball|2 minutes|Fireball over Tacoma Wa.|4/13/10|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/074/S74557.html|237|ndxe201003| Fireball over Tacoma Wa.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I witnessed a gently pulsating (~4 Second Intervals) orange light/fireball moving due north over Tacoma, Washington at a constant angle of about 70 degrees above the western horizon.  Though I could not judge the distance or altitude well, the “apparent and relative” speed and size was like that of a landing light from a military airplane or the International Space Station at it’s brightest passing overhead.  It was noticeably brighter and slightly larger than a planet or bright star but I noted no atmospheric aberration giving the sensation that it was a small object moving by at a close distance (a few hundred feet away).  This struck me as bizarre because my logic dictated that the object, like an aircraft at that motion, should be a mile or two away.  At one point, the object began to slowly undulate and decelerated to a stop within about five seconds, then emitted an apparently solid “column” of light from the bottom.  The light column did not continue ! downward to the ground, but ceased in mid-air about two to three degrees below the object.  Also, this emitted light was shimmering with several colors (ie. Purple, green, white), and was minor in magnitude in comparison to the luminosity of the main object body and was relatively difficult to see clearly.  After about ten seconds, the light column and fireball disappeared and in it’s place began a bright white and random strobe pattern.  The object then accelerated to the north again, achieving extremely high apparent speed until it disappeared from view down near the north horizon.  (I had just enough time to run upstairs from my south side downstairs porch to see the last few seconds of it passing into the distance from my north-facing second-story kitchen window).  I also noted that the light portion of the blinking interval cycle was very fast or “instantaneous” compared with strobe lights that I had seen before this.  Total U.F.O. observation time was about two minute! s, and lastly, there was no noticeable sound coming from the o! bject th roughout the sighting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have lived near a major US Air Force base my entire life and have spent 34 years around many different aircraft of which I feel that I have become very familiar.  This object, which I only passively noticed far in the distance from the corner of my eye, very quickly struck me as odd and out of place.  I had a strong feeling that this object, if not a human-piloted or controlled craft, definitely exhibited signs of intelligence or intelligent control, possibly even aware of my observing it.  I was transfixed throughout the sighting and found the experience beautiful, fascinating, unsettling, and frightening.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

There was no explosion  or shaking afterwards, and I have yet to seen something of this nature since.<n>

I just was panning the beautiful clear skies and all the stars were visible. I looked almost completely vertical from my standing position and noticed a brilliant ball of light and I would say &#34;star-like&#34; in appearance racing across the sky from west to east.  It travelled at an unbelievable rate of speed. I saw it moving and I always see either planes or falling stars or just familiar objects in the sky.  I had to take a deep breath and gather my thoughts. I immediately reached for my phone to attempt to record a small portion of video.  By the time I reached down and the fraction of a second i had to take my eyes off of the object it just disappeared.  I would also like to say that the altitude of this object seemed to be in the range of deep space.  It really looked like a star to me but it never appeared to get closer to me, like a falling star.  It appeared to stay at the same elevation during the entire observation time and just zip across the sky like a vehicle under some sort of propulsion.  It really got me to think of what the object was.  I would say that it was an unidentified object in the night sky.  It was nothing I have ever seen before and I am a sky watcher, and not for UFO&#39;s just because I love nature and enjoy the sky clouds and at night stars and the moon.  It was just weird and wanted to post something to see if anyone could either explain this object or maybe someone else saw the same thing I did.

At first, I thought it was a satellite passing over, but then realized that it was moving to fast for that. I watched it for about five seconds, and then was shocked to see it make a hard turn to the right, a 90 degree turn and then a second 90 degree turn so that it was heading back towards me. It then started moving back in the original direction, with no noticeable turn made.  It was out of sight within a matter of seconds.  There were no other witnesses to this.<n>

We noticed a flying object hovering over south knoxville.  We stood there in our car to observe it. It started moving at a faster speed torward the east, came to a halt then started moving again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We watched it till the trees blocked out our view.  It had a wierd almost triangular shape with flashing lights all around.<n>
3/3/10 21:45|Cape Town (South Africa)||Fireball|5 - 10 minutes|From a star to a huge bright orange light to dropping and landing in the sea.|8/24/10|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/077/S77004.html|243|ndxe201003| From a star to a huge bright orange light to dropping and landing in the sea.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I would like to report a UFO sighting from 03-03-2010 in Cape Town, South Africa.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Three friends and myself were at my flat, which over looks Cape Town city bowl. My sister went outside for a smoke and immediately shouted for us to come outside to see something. From my balcony over looking the whole of Cape Town city bowl, we saw a light. It started the size of a star and as it came closer it got bigger.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first we thought it was a meteor because of its speed and the size it was becoming. It was soon as big as a full moon, but a burning orange. It seemed to hover for about 30 seconds then hovered to the right and it got smaller. It then did 3 big flashes, as though it was turning it&#39;s lights off, then all you could see was a black shadow with tiny orange lights.  It was only my one friend and I who could see this, as the other two wear contacts and their vision isn&#39;t very good.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It started to descend relatively fast.  Just as it reached the glow from the city lights it went completely black and dropped fast. It appeared to have landed in the ocean.  The whole experience lasted between 5 and 10 minutes, and it was around 21:45.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Also on radio 5FM, a local radio station, two days after our experience, my 1one friend was listening in her car, and said a man phoned in from Pretoria and had the exact same story as ours except that his just disappeared.<n>

3/3/10 19:00|Crete|IL|Formation|half hour|possibly many crafts|4/13/10|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/074/S74545.html|245|ndxe201003| possibly many crafts<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was driving home from work headed north on Rt. 50 coming through the town of Monee and headed into the Beecher/Crete area.  There is a racetrack in Crete and I frequently see lights form over that area for no reason.  These are hovering bright white lights low to the ground, they are not helicopters or airplanes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I initially saw two lights that turned into four light in the shape of a triangle but it was not a fixed object because a couple of lights would slightly move out of formation.  As I was focusing in on what this formation was I turned to the left to kind of see behind me as I was rounding a curve and I saw more lights that were bright, white and the same size and they made an even bigger formation.  I was only able to count about 10 lights but there may have been more behind me that I could not see.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had a very unnerving moment where when I looked up at the expanse of the sky it was a complete horseshoe and they were all in a line and just hovered and were bright.  I cannot believe the news did not report on it, I was not the only one on the road - there were plenty of us driving that night.  I have a feeling there were more lights behind me but my vantage point would not allow me to look as I had to concentrate on the road.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I pulled into my driveway, I got out of the vehicle hoping to see a big circle or the entire formation of the lights and half of them were gone.  Then I saw a couple more lights just go out. Then there was nothing. It was incredibly weird and I felt uneasy about it.  The duration from when I initially saw the first couple of lights was about 20 minutes-half hour.<n>
3/3/10 13:35|Phoenix|AZ|Unknown|Approx 15 Min|2 white objects in Phoenix, one changes color to red|4/13/10|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/074/S74540.html|246|ndxe201003| 2 white objects in Phoenix, one changes color to red<n> <n><n> <n><n> Unfortunately, I was in my car driving at the time and as I result was unable to witness the conclusion of the event. I was traveling east on Bethany Home Rd around 19th Ave.  I was headed to the Christown shopping center area to get drive through Taco Bell (bad for me, I know), when I saw a white object in the eastern sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object was bouncing upward and looked like a plastic bag caught in an updraft, which is what I thought it was at first, but then it just stopped and seemed to hover.  I had to make a turn into the parking lot and I lost track of the object.  I parked and got out to try and reacquire it, but no luck.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I got back into the car and drove to the drive through.  After I got there and ordered, and another car pulled in behind me so I couldn&#39;t back out, I saw the object again.  This time it was closer to being overhead, slightly north and east of my position. I have to take my eye off it to pull forward.  Once I stopped, I look for the object once again.  Now I see 2 objects, the new one further west of the original. I pull forward again.  Now when I look at the objects, the new one has changed color to red.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The objects are moving, but so slow I could hardly tell.  The white object seems to be moving closer to the red object.  The white object starts to circle around the red object counter clockwise, all the while closing the distance between them. I have to look away to pay for my food.  I look up very briefly after taking my food and see the white object moving away from the red one.  I sped out of the drive through to a parking space; I get out and look for the objects once again.  They are nowhere to be found at this point.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I would like to know if anyone else saw this and if anyone knows what these objects were.<n>

We both looked up into the dark night sky and saw several lights close together as if attached red, blue, green and so on giving the appearance of a large craft looking from the bottom similar to one of a star wars movie.  My mother soon arrived and as we drove home three spherical lights seemed to follow and hovered over my house as I exited the car from the short drive two more lights emerged and hovered over as well.  Going inside I looked out my window and within the few seconds it took for my going inside they disappeared.  I later heard of similar events on the news over tower city.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.  PD))<n>

March 3rd north of Fairfield, Iowa being observed by 4 jets.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My son stepped out for a smoke at 7:10 pm Wednesday March 3rd and happened to see a comet like object crashing to the east of the Fairfield airpor, surrounded by four jet airplanes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> To the eye it appeared about an inch across, was fiery red turning to bright green as it hit.<n> <n><n> <n><n> He expected to see and hear an explosion and sound but there was none.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Many other people driving in its direction must have seen it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was no report of it on the local TV news.  I notified the papers and they didn&#39;t print a story.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It may have been satalite debris that did not burn up completely on reentry and was being tracted by NASA who calculated its crash location and sent the Air Force jets to observe where it hit.  And such incidents are kept secret from the public so as not to jeopridise the space program.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My son is 30, a very realistic and practical person who is not into fantacy or the esoteric.  He said the lights of the jets in tne night sky were far apart flying  north all in the same direction over a broad area prior to impact, then they flew  over the site for 15 to 20 minutes.  Three of the jets arived together and were joined by a fourth which flew off in a different direction when they left.<n>

3/2/10 05:00|Austin|TX|Unknown|30 seconds|Object with unusually large and luminous lights seen hovering completely still 100 yards off the highway.|4/13/10|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/074/S74527.html|250|ndxe201003| Object with unusually large and luminous lights seen hovering completely still 100 yards off the highway.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Driving at 5:00 AM on I-35 in S. Austin, a object with unusual lights was seen about 100 yards off of the interstate, hovering completely still about 300-400 feet in the air. The object had larger and more luminous lights than normal, with one steady blue light and one slowly blinking red light. The driver approached the object and it was completely stationary. First impression was that the object was some sort of tethered balloon with lights, but subsequent events ruled out this possibility. Upon passing underneath the object, driver noted that the body of the craft appeared to have a very unusual shape, possibly triangular, though it was difficult to see under the conditions. The object remained stationary for the duration that the driver could view it in the rear-view mirror.  Driver then made a u-turn on the interstate as soon as possible to return to the sight of the spotting. Upon returning approximately 2 minutes later, the craft was nowhere to be see! n, which was thought to be unusual since if it had been a hovering helicopter he would have expected to see it moving off into the distance. Driver wished he could have seen the object move to obtain more information, but it seems likely that the object was an unusual craft of some sort.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

We pulled over because of the nature of these lights. They were closley clubbed together and were not making any sound. One of the lights dissappeared completely. One of the lights then speeded off then completely stopped as if waiting for the other lights to catch up once the three light were all together again they dissapperd as if someone flicked a switch. There was no flash, haze, smoke, burning nothing they just all dissappeared into the night sky. It was a very clear night. If it was four helicopters or aircrafts for one they wouldn&#39;t have been so close together. The lights were exaggerated star like shapes with very prononced pointy edges. The lights did not leave any kind of trail behind them. This happened in a small village in the middle of the country side where air traffic and other explainable occurances are rare.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

While enroute, my son calmly asked what the white things were in the distance. I did not know what he was talking about until we were at a stop light. I saw a round and tight formation of about 20 or more small bright blips. While at the light, I noticed they moved together in a manner that could be best described as a &#34;school of fish.&#34;  The formation of light would all glow a white hot bright for a few seconds and then the bright glow would quickly dissipate.  But you could still see them. When they were not glowing brightly I could make out what appeared to be a dark spot on the top what appeared to be an avoid shape as the sun reflected off of a dull metallic surface of each one.  The best way for me to describe the shape and color of the surface would be that each object appeared like an upside down brushed stainless steel cooking Wok.  Then in perfect unison, they would all glow white hot ! again, similar to what a high intensity headlamp would appear like.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The most interesting thing about this formation, is that they all maintained separation from each other and did not appear to be moving in front or behind each other like a swarm of bees might appear like.  The formation did move gradually at times, but appeared to hang in the air and slowly gain altitude.  I could not believe this happening in broad daylight with local airtraffic all over the place.  I then opened my sunroof as the roof pillar of my car began to obstruct my view, but at this point it was unsafe for me to continue taking my eyes off the road.  The local weather at the time was perfect.   65F, low humidity, with clear blue sky and unlimited visibility and winds that were no more than 10-12 knots.<n>

3/1/10 06:00|San Diego|CA|Other|2.5 hour|Chemtrails over San Diego, Ca. the morning of March 01, 2010.|4/13/10|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/074/S74516.html|261|ndxe201003| Chemtrails over San Diego, Ca. the morning of March 01, 2010.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is a ChemTrail sighting report. The aircraft were large resembling passenger airliners; they were drab grey mostly and black in color. There were approximately 4-6 planes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I awoke for work at 6 am PST March 1, 2010; I live in San Diego East County near hwy 67. The sky was perfectly clear and blue near my location, except for two jet con trails going from east to west. This is not in the standard flight path for the area for either civilian or military aircraft; there is no commercial flight path at this location.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I work a short distance from home approximately 10 miles by road near the hwy 8 and 125. I observed at this location from 7am to 8:30 two aircraft making chemtrails traveling east to west, one was at a higher elevation, and you could see that it was an airplane but it was too high up to get details of the craft. The other plane was at a lower enough elevation to see the size and color of the plane, it had wing tips they were facing up, two jets motors on each wing, drab grey and black in color. You could not hear a jet exhaust noise from the airplanes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I observed 5 passes with this pattern; it would vary in respect to starting from southeast towards northwest and starting northeast towards southwest at the high and low elevations. I could not observe the whole incident, but I saw enough to know these facts to be accurate.  As a few minutes past I  found a vantage point to look at the sky again; I observed 11 chemtrails in the sky at varying heights going east to west and two from a more north to south west direction. I observed during two passes at the lower elevation after the &#34;cloud&#34; spread was starting, these planes had no chemtrails coming out of them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Slowly the chemtrails would spread out and the slight westerly breeze would push them east, you could see these &#34;cloud&#34; were stopping from the atmospheric pressure of the local mountains, so the chemtrails spread out from north to south. It appeared like there were several very, very long thin &#34;clouds&#34; stretching from east to west.<n> <n><n> <n><n> By mid afternoon I could no longer feel the warm sun which I had from the morning or see bright blue sky. The sky was filled with a hazy looking &#34;cloud&#34; layer. Not any cloud I have seen, but a hazy white cover in the sky, with slight blue sky color penetrating through.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As of this writing at 5:45pm PST there is still a white even haze in the sky, at my homes vantage point I can see normal puffy clouds behind the local Mt. Laguna to the east, which I see all the time as a normal weather pattern occurrence.<n> <n><n> <n><n> These &#34;hazy clouds&#34; on the west side of Mount Laguna, were created from the trails of these military looking jet aircraft as I have described here. There is no round or puffiness shape to it, as with normal natural clouds, in regards to the hazy flat white layer created by these planes.<n>
