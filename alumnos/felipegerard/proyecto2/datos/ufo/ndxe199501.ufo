About 6:35AM i had just passed outside the village of elbridge,ny on rte 5,approaching the hill going towards camillus,ny. i approached  some high power lines going across the road (near pirro brother&#39;s ford dealership,feeks rd) and i see a large object between the 3 suspended wires. at first i thought it was a large balloon craft,but there was no basket attached. i looked at it trying to figure out what it was? my mind was searching for a familiar object to answer my question. as i got closer to it,i discovered that the object was a &#34;PERFECT TOP&#34; shape(like a kid&#39;s top) and it was a beautiful copper color like polished copper pipe. to give you a idea of the size,stretch your arm out directly in front of yourself and spread your fingers out wide. it was as tall in the sky as the distance between your pinky to your thumb(8-9&#34;high). i estimate the distance away, at 1 mile, and a about half mile high to the right and away from route 5.so,it was quite large. size was very hard to judge because there were no wheels,antennae,pipes,etc,it was just a &#34;DIVINE SHAPE&#34;,a perfect example of &#34;SACRED GEOMETRY&#34;. the most divine thing i&#39;ve ever seen. then,my mind continued inquiring&#34;WHAT IS IT?&#34; then,the hair on the back of my neck started to stand on end. &#34;OH MY GOD,IT&#34;S A UFO&#34;!. this is a very creepy feeling to look at something that big in front of you and not know what it is. it&#39;s very twilight zonish.then my mind said ,&#34;duh!,that&#39;s why they call them&#34;UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECTS&#34;. at that moment i realized the very &#34;meaning&#34; of those words. i didn&#39;t know if it was a craft,an entity or what.i continued to drive up the hill.looking back and to the right and seeing it. i felt safer driving and watching it,i didn&#39;t feel good about stopping the car and getting out and looking at it,i think i ! was worried about getting beamed onboard. another unusual thing was it was perfectly &#34;still&#34; in the sky,it did not move an iota. anything manmade moves in the sky.this was strange also,i was the only one on the highway that saw it,i kept looking to see if anyone else stopped or slowed down. there were cars ahead of me and behind me on both sides of the road. NO ONE ELSE SAW IT ! . i got farther down the road to route 690 and finally got to work. i couldn&#39;t wait to tell my 4-5 co-workers i knew i could trust in confidence. when i walked in to the office we had a group meeting,with 25-30 guys,so i couldn&#39;t say anything immediately,there were too many guys. during the meeting  a &#34;bizarre&#34; thing happened to my memory. I COMPLETELY FORGOT THE UFO AND DIDN&#34;T REMEMBER IT UNTIL APRIL !5TH. my mind went completely blank for 2 and a half months!  On april 15th,i was home watching &#34;unsolved mysteries&#34; and all of a sudden it &#34;clicked in&#34;,i told my nephew jim that i had seen a large MOTHERSHIP and had never told anyone! i couldn&#39;t believe i had forgotten it for 2 and a half months! i called the state police and reported it,also i wanted to know if anyone else had seen it. no one had. i also called a lady(an abductee) in syracuse that took UFO REPORTS. she told me that my memory lapse was completely normal and that it happens all the time. i didn&#39;t have any &#34;missing time&#34; that i&#39;m aware of. this is not the end of the story. in october of 1999 i met a clairvoyant in border&#39;s bookstore in syracuse,she had just recently written a book on future incarnations called&#34;sparks through time&#34;. i went to her booksigning and lecture.at the lecture i won a free clairvoyant reading from her. i told her i would call her at a later date after i figure out what i wanted to ask. i gave her no previous information. on december 13,1999 i called her and carefully phrased my questions. i asked if she could give me the significance of an incident that happened jan 30th 1995 at 6:35 AM in elbridge,ny. she contacted her guides and paused for a! few moments and then announced,&#34;YOU HAVE BEEN SHOWN THE PRESENCE OF ALIENS!&#34;. i was completely flabbergasted,it was so absolutely true,it just blew my mind she said that! she had verified my experience. she also told me that this was my 3rd experience(i don&#39;t remember the 1st two,it may have happened when i was a kid).but,it was also not my last either,i have others coming up in the future. this is not the end of the story. in february of 2001,my artist friend jack and i went for a ride and retraced the original ride and area so that he could do a painting of the original UFO site. we took many pictures from different angles,i wanted him to capture what i actually saw that january 30th morning. i told jack let&#39;s take a ride to the area a mile away which would have been exactly and directly under the UFO. from route 5,we turned right on lynch rd,went about 3/4 of a mile to the &#34; t &#34; and turned right on to halfway rd(i had never been in this area before). i told jack the that the UFO was still a ways a way and the very next left and half mile up that road would be where the ufo would have been. as we approached the next road,a tingling sensation went up my back and jack&#39;s also.THE NEXT ROAD WE WE TURNING ONTO,WHERE THE UFO WAS, WAS&#34;CAMPBELL&#34; RD(my last name). the topped shape-UFO had hovered over CAMPBELL RD like a gigantic exclamation point pointing the way. jack and i took this as a major sign and and confirmation of what i saw. after i saw this,i never had any doubts about my &#34;vision&#34; and that i was supposed to see this as part of my spiritual growth. this story is the absolute truth as i know it. WE ARE NOT ALONE! harry<n>

As we drove, I had noticed a light high up in the sky, a few miles away.  It was a beautiful white light, with hues of green and red around the edges.  At first I thought it was a star, and I pointed it out to my mother.  The sky was very clear, and it was a cold night.  There didn&#39;t seem to be many cars on the road as we drove home.  When I looked up again, I noticed that the object had moved some distance ahead of us.  Keeping my eye on it, we turned down another road.  The object slowly moved from left to right, then flew behind us, and then in front of us.  It seemed to follow us like this all the way home.  It flew very smoothly, yet seemed to be able to travel many miles relatively quickly.  Later that night as we were watching the nightly news, they reported that many others, including a police officer reported seeing the same mysterious object in the sky.<n>
1/19/95 22:00|Cancun (Mexico)||Chevron|10 minutes|Glowing objects flying over Cancun|4/13/10|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/074/S74428.html|28|ndxe199501| Glowing objects flying over Cancun<n> <n><n> <n><n> While on a business trip to Cancun, an associate and I were the only tourists lounging by the unlit hotel pool and gazing at the stars.  We simultaneously observed what we thought was a shooting star streak across the sky.  As we &#34;ahhed&#34; in pleasure at the sight, the &#34;shooting  star&#34; stopped above our heads and reversed direction.  We immediately became silent and confused when another &#34;shooting star&#34; streaked back toward us crossing the path of the first object at a sharp angle.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At this point, we both confirmed that we were actually seeing the same thing.  The objects both turned and then slowly headed back toward each other and appeared to come together and turned away at extremely tight angles.  As we watched, another object streaked across the paths of the first two.<n> <n><n> <n><n> During the time we watched, these lightly glowing objects continued to streak across the travel paths of each other.  They moved slowly when they were grouped near each other and we could see that they were more or less chevron shaped with the entire shape being defined by a clear, visible glow.  The glow was about the same intensity of the surrounding stars with a greenish tint to the light they appeared to emit.<n> <n><n> <n><n> All of their movement was in straight lines or at sharp angles, creating invisible triangular travel paths as they flew past and crossed over each other.  Occasionally, they would come together for a fraction of a second only to break away quickly in different angular patterns.<n> <n><n> <n><n> One of the hotel employees was cleaning the pool.  He did not speak English and my Spanish was quite rusty.  However, when I asked about what we were observing, I understood him to explain that these were birds and they glowed because of the plankton in the waters that that also glowed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The explanation seemed acceptable to a point.  That could certainly explain the greenish glow and the chevron shape.  However, I live in an area where there are a lot of hawks and falcons that fly on the thermals created in the hills of my community.  I have not seen any of these birds flying in the angular patterns that I observed.  Their turns tend to be more gentle and curved.  I have seen none of these birds come together but would allow that at night, seeing the objects seemingly meet may have been an illusion as one object could have been above or below the other.  This does not explain how the objects would consistently appear to break away from each other and travel in different directions but I feel that even some of those observations could also be attributed to illusion and vision impairment created by the night skies.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Perhaps the most extraordinary behavior that gives me pause to question the bird explanation more than any other is the fact that all of their movement appeared to be in straight lines with all turns seemingly to be accomplished only with sharp angular movement.  I have since attempted to research sea bird sightings under similar circumstances and watch the movement of other groups of birds but have found no descriptions that seem to fit my experience.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At this time, I cannot say for sure that what I saw but they were not shooting stars.  However, I have seen that other visitors to Cancun have described similar sightings at later dates.<n>

She looked out her kitchen window, and saw an exceptionally bright green light, which she thought was the landing light on a local logging helicopter.  Then she noticed there was a &#34;wavy, lavender-red thing&#34; behind the light.  It hovered in the night sky for an hour, moving perceptibly across the sky.  One hour after she first observed the object, a smaller &#34;dot&#34; of light streaked up to the larger object.  A third object then became visible, and then all three faded from sight.  Very strange sighting.<n>

We could, however, see three bright lights in a triangular pattern.  Being an avid reader of aircraft publications, I at first thought it resembled an F-117, but it was hovering.  I knew that because it was hovering, that could not possibly be what it was.  It was also very quiet and within 500 feet of the ground.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Almost as soon as we got a good look at this object, it sped away without a sound and from a standstill.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

I am placing it in the mid-ninties and at night because it was dark. I don&#39;t remember the exact time - but it was in the pm and not too late at night.  I was wearing a coat so it was in the colder months here in PA.  I don&#39;t remember the exact month. Anyhow, I remember the US was in the midtst of going to another Gulf War - that&#39;s why I am placing it in the mid-nineties - when I think Clinton was threatening to go to war or something..<n> <n><n> <n><n> Anuhow, About the siting: I was driving a friend home on RT 476 (Blue Route) South bound around Plymouth Meeting. I looked out my side window and saw a cluster of red and green lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first, it seemed like a regular air plane, then some weird things took place. It seemed to get bigger, then, it looked like a Bowling Pin suspended in the sky and swaying back and forth and then it seemed to get really small and it looked like it actually spit out a white lit, rectangular object with a bunch of lights on the under side.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object flew right over our car.  It was silent and seemed to be landing in the grass to our right.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My friend started screaming for me to hit the gas and get out of there. I wanted to see it but because she was so histerical I did hit the gas and scurried on out of there as fast as I could.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My friend had a better view of the object as she looked out her window as it flew over the car and started to get lower and seem to be wanting to land to our right and saw it fly right over us - I could see the reflection of the lights from the object as it flew over head on the ground as it went over the car and to the right.  There were round, white lights on the bottom of this object and the lights also reflected on the ground around our car.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Has anyone else reported anything like this around that date?<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

At the time, I delivered mail for a company.  It was about 4:30am. It was either Jan. or Feb. of 1995.  I was on Miller Run road, I had just gotten off of I-75, I was almost to my destination when I heard a real quiet hum, I thought it was my delivery vehicle.  I turned the radio off, and noticed a black shadow behind me (my vehicle).  I slowed down, and it went right over me.  It was a trianle shape, and very, very huge.  It was very, very quiet for it&#39;s shape.  What scared me most is how low it could go, at such a slow speed and so quiet.  It was in the winter time, like I said I turned down my radio.  I put my window down, and could not believe how quiet it was.  It was an airy, kind of light suction, sound with a slight hiss.  It was about 1 1/2- to 2 telephone pole lenghts above me.  I seen a few very dim light, 3 if that.  It appeared to be very large, maybe the size of an average stadium.  It was more triangular in shape.  This vessel did not harm me in any way.

It changed colors, so I thought it was an ambulance or police car. I&#39;m guessing that the trailer park was about a mile away. The street light at night is pretty much all you can see of it otherwise.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was concerned because I knew some of the people there, one in particular I commuted to work with each day.<n> <n><n> <n><n> But the light lifted off the ground, and so I thought it was a helicopter. But it then moved erratically, and I mean something crazy. I&#39;ve seen helicopters lift off several times, but this was wild. And the range of colors wasn&#39;t typical from what I&#39;ve seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> (At this point, I woke up my parents and we all watched it approach.)  It moved slowly, eventually coming our way, passing close to our house. That&#39;s when we got a good look at it. It was no helicopter. By this time, it&#39;s movement was straight and smooth. It seemed like it was flying much lower than the majority of planes I&#39;d see in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Just before it got to our house, it&#39;s lights changed to a constant, steady white. No blinking or any other colors. I could see the outline exactly. It didn&#39;t look at all like a stealth bomber. It was a perfect triangle with three lights on the underside, one near each angle. No sound, and it was moving really slow. I&#39;ve seen helicopters move faster. If it was as high as the regular planes in the sky I would see (about those speeds), then it had to be pretty big. I later saw a news report of people describing the same kind of craft, and the pictures they showed were exactly like what we saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am a student, without any special qualifications other than artist (excellent with visual skills); my father is a military veteran; my mother is a housewife.<n> <n><n> <n><n> SUPPLEMENTARY: The image at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_triangle_(UFO) is the closest.

Some moved west toward the ocean, and others appeared to rise up higher in the atmosphere, at which point they would be joined by smaller, green objects, that appeared to fly in from out in space.  The larger objects appeared to be emitting a pulsing light.  They also seemed to be flying into, and between, the tops of the storm clouds in the area.  The observer tired of the events after approximately 45 minutes and went back to bed.<n>

I was laying on my back,but felt nothing under me. During this time I had no fear, I felt very relaxed and calm. I woke up after a unknown period of time to saw a bright light shining in my bedroom window from a angle that would be imposible for any type of aircraft to do because of very tall pine trees behind our house.

I was heading straight north at the time of the sighting and was only 5-6 miles from Lake Erie as the crow flies. At first, I was amazed to see as large a meteor as this one first appeared. The object came from the west and was moving at a very high rate of speed just a one would expect a meteor to do. It approached at appx.a 40&#39; angle to the ground and was a bright yellowish green color, similar to a tennis ball. I quickly noticed, however, that this was no meteor. As it neared the ground it came to a complete stop and began pulsing and it&#39;s color changed from yellow to orange. It hung in mid air for 3-4 seconds and then headed straight down so fast that my eyes could barely keep up with it, possibly heading into Lake Erie.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

Subsequent reports by investigators suggest that some kind(s) of officials were in the area shortly after event, requesting that local and state officials say nothing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  To the best of our knowledge, this event was not only dramatic, but quite bizarre, as well.  We were first contacted Saturday night, January 7, 1995, by an Operations Officer in TEMA, who reported to us that the event had occurred, and that their offices had been activated, as a result of the strange event, and subsequent explosion.  The latter was so dramatic that a member of the local aviation community, who had witnessed the event, immediately following the explosion, drove to the airport and took off in an aircraft to search for what he was certain had been an airliner that had exploded in midair.<n> <n><n> <n><n> TEMA contacted the U. S. Air Force, apparently informing them that a possible UFO event had occurred, and inquiring what TEMA should do.  According to the TEMA official we spoke with, TEMA was informed by the USAF to contact the National UFO Reporting Center.  TEMA did contact our Center by telephone, and faxed to our offices a seven-page document, written by a Warren County Deputy Sheriff, in which that officer describeded the explosion, according to eyewitnesses.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We express our sincere gratitude to TEMA for their effort in sharing the information with our Center.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Peter Davenport, Director))<n>

It was shortly after sunset.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were standing there looking down at the cities below us and my attention then went to the horizon towards the south and slightly west (ssw I guess).  I saw what looked like two moving stars in the sky above the horizon.  One was white in color the other red.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I pointed this out to my friend who also saw the sight.  The two objects were moving rapidly towards the ground.  When they reached the ground there was a flash and one of the objects flew rapidly upward and away, the other object had disappeared.  The objects were definitely far from our location, probably hundreds of miles away, if not thousands.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was 22 at the time of the siting and have since lost contact with the individual that shared the experience with me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date of sighting may be approximate, although the witness does not indicate that fact.

1/7/95 14:00|Lake Grove (Portland Metro)|OR|Disk||Round silvery disk quickly passing from W to E in a straight line|1/28/99|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/002/S02877.html|65|ndxe199501| Summary : Round silvery disk quickly passing from W to E in a straight line<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was enjoying the weather from my second- floor apartment deck on that fine Saturday July 1, 1995 afternoon. The 2pm (PDT) sky was partly cloudy, mostly evenly scattered cumulus with a clear blue sky behind them. I am sometimes given to looking straight up into the sky in search of high-flying raptors or other soaring birds. As I looked directly overhead,I noticed something moving well above the cumulus clouds. It was a silvery object about the size of a dime held at arm&#39;s length moving in an unwavering straight line from west to east. I watched as it passed behind the clouds which were moving so slowly as to appear to be completely still. I would not want to hazard a guess as to its altitude or airspeed. My first thought was that it was simply a weather balloon. (In fact, I&#39;m still leaning towards that explanation.) As I studied it I wondered if it was in fact not silver, but translucent. It had a bluish cast but was darker around a well-defined edge and had no irregularities in its shape or surface. However, a few things didn&#39;t rest well with me. I&#39;ve seen weather balloons in flight before and this wasn&#39;t like either of them. This was perfectly round and had no visible payload. The others I had seen weren&#39;t nearly so symmetrical and were visibly balloons with something suspended underneath. Also, given that this object was well above the clouds, it would have been a *very* large balloon. As far as I know, there aren&#39;t any launch sites west of Portland used for such launchings. (That may just be my ignorance in this instance; the only launch site for high- altitude balloons that I know of is near Palestine, Texas.) I found it odd that it moved so much faster than the lower clouds, though of course the possibility of the jet stream comes to mind. I was also impressed that it moved in such a straight line. It covered about 30 degrees of the sky in 4-5 seconds. It disappeared behind a solid line of clouds banked up against Mt. Hood and the Oregon Cascades to the east. I have no idea if this was a *real* UFO or not. In fact, the most remarkable aspect of this incindent may simply be that I saw an ordinary thing in a place most people wouldn&#39;t ordinarily look--straight overhead--without some other motivation. It just to be odd enought to warrant reporting to you. Had I known how to contact anyone regarding this prior, I would have. When the UFO Center was on the news with the space junk reentry story, I knew where to go. If you need more info, contact me via email. Thanks!<n>

At approximately 0500 hrs., both of them heard a very loud noise, &#34;like two large trucks,&#34; and observed a bizarre hump-backed, triangular object hovering in the sky nearby.  The object had &#34;windows,&#34; but they were opaque.  The object was seen to move, but only very slowly.  When it moved, the red light on the ventral side of the object alternated red and green blinking.  Then it moved toward the vicinity of Diamond Head, where it hovered for 5 minutes, after which it moved slowly westward along the coastline and finally disappeared from sight.<n>

It was going around in circles, reversing direction, stopping, accelerating, and then slowing down,then it would speed back up and circle around and back and forth, it was crazy. It was very far away, big, and flew all the way from one side of the sky to the other on the horizon as fast as you could move your arm with a sparkler on 4th of July. It freaked my wife out. All of a sudden she wanted to know about ufos. I own 2 local businesses, my wifes a legal secratary. It wasnt a helecoptor, meteor or anything easily explained, and it definately was controlled by something. It flew off and got so far away we couldnt see it anymore, it just faded out. It was a crystal clear night, you could see every star in the sky. We arent nuts. There was a commercial aircraft flying with wing lights flying that was closer and lower then it, and it was going way slower then the ufo. It was silent.

He was in a playful mood and I began to throw small stones which he would chase.  As I was walking over to pick up a few small stones in the corner of walled in yard, I happen to grance up into the very clear, cloudless sky and noticed a darken object very low to the ground.  At first I could not determine if the craft was moving.  At this point it was quite some distance away, approx 1 to 1 1/2 miles.  I continued to watch the craft and it began to get larger.  I knew the craft was obviously coming in my direction.  I kept wondering why the aircraft had not turned on its landing lights be cause the U.S. Air Force Base (Davis-Monthan AFB) was only a few miles south of my home.  The base is almost directly south of my home the the Tucson International Airport is just on the other side (slightly southwest).  I immediately called the craft to!my daughters attention who had just come out to tell me one of my favorate programs had just come on.  We both stood there watching as the craft got closer.  When it was approximately 3/4 mile from us,  it&#39;s true shape became visible.  It was a triangle shaped craft, moving very slowly at approximately five to eight miles per hour.  It was approximately 75 to 100 feet above the ground.  It had no lights on the front of the craft at all.  I told my daughter that it was going to pass almost directly over us.  When it got to only a few hundred feet away, we began to see lights on the bottom of it.  There were four lights that were in a straight line down the middle of it that ran the full lenght.  The lights were spaced about 20 feet apart.  As it passed slightly infront and above us, we could see very clearly that the craft was metalic in color and did not have a smooth surface but appeared to have a plated surface.  I could see what appeared to be lines of rivits that connecte!d them togather.  The craft did not make a single sound, and after spending 18 years on active duty in the Air Force, I knew it was not something that was man made.  It I were going to guess at its weight based on its size as mentioned above---I would say approxmiately 80 to 110 tons.  As I passed by my daughter was the first to notice two stobes on the rear corners that were blinking very fast (much faster than normal aircraft), both were white lights and could only be seen from behind.  Even when the craft was at its closest point from us, could not be seen until the rear of the craft began to become visable.  It was at this pont that I could even more clearly see the previously mentioned plating affect.  I was able to at this point based on the visible edges of the triangle in my own mind determine the thickness of the craft .  The back of the craft had three very large lights , two approximately 10 feet in diamenter and the third much larger light between them.  It was abo!ut 15 feet in diamenter.  It may sound strange but the lights were not giving off a really bright light but definately light that appeared to be defused.  The lights on the bottom of the craft appeared defused as well.  The craft was close enough that a man with a good strong throwing arm could have easily hit it.  I know that this story sounds like something out of a science fiction book, but I swear it&#39;s the truth.  I will be more than willing to take any lie-detector test you want.  Feel free to contact me concerning this sighting.  I almost forgot--the following day after the close encounter, while in the restroom of my home preparing to shower or something i remember finding a blister about the size of a dime just above my left ankle.  There was no pain, and I only noticed it as I was taking of my sock.  I pressed slightly on it and rolled my index finger around.  It poped and I expected to feel pain but there was none.  I pealed away the lose skin and noticed that the ti!ssue that should have appeared red or pink was brown.  Normally, blisters don;t leave scars in a perfect circle--this one did.  The only reason I have taken this time to tell you about what we seen, is that I can&#39;t stop thinking about it.  I hope if have really reached someone who will take the time necessary to confirm my sighting anyway they have to.  Now I know for sure--They do exist and I don&#39;t care who says they don&#39;t.  That includes our goverment.<n>

I began to hear a vacuum noise or the sound of air being sucked into a a pipe?. I was listening to this for about 2 or 3 minutes still not moving at all , after a while I noticed something very big had moved over my head at about 1 mph ,Startled I looked up a saw a huge delta or trianke shaped craft, It had no engine sound it looked seemless with a very shiney tinsel type foil making a slight tinkle sound all along the back side. the front seemed to have air collapsing into the front as if taking in air. it was about 30 feet above my head and about 200 feet wide and 100 feet front to rear. it looked like a delta wing. the second i looked up i moved my rifle toward it and it suddenly shot off in about a half second, the woods were quiet again.  I have never seen anything before of after this as far as crafts ,except for the very next night 150 miles back to st.petersburg. My wife and I were both awakened in our bed under our open window at 4 am , we were awokened by a humming sound with a low dull fadeing in and out type of sound, we both looked out and with her as my witness we saw a five foot tall glowing orange ball ,looked like a dim sun&#39; it was sitting rite outside my window! when we talked it began to move off the property and pick up speed til it moved over a very busy intersection and disapered up into the sky &#34; her exact words were &#34;what the hell did you bring back with you?!&#34;   This is were it gets weiard and scary for me about a year ago I was awakened in my bed but I am totally paralized I could only use my eyes ,I looked up and one aliean &#34;your very typical looking type&#34; moved rite through my bedroom wall,said nothing to with words ,it used its thoughts to tell me to not be afraid we have something to do here&#34; the next thing I know 4 or 5 more creeped rite through the other walls from living room and a locked ! door to my room, i was laying on my side and they had inflated my lungs and used an incredable amount of force to blow somthing from my lungs ,they did this several times after they were  satisfied they all left through one wall to the outside. After about 5 minutes or less I was very slowly able to start moving ,I was laying on my side toward the dresser, the dresser was coated a vapor from lungs &#34;It was 3 feet from my bed&#34; I got up turned all the lights on and stayed up til work I was 36 at the time and not very comfortable with what I went through , .Although I am aware of a common sleep phenomenon assoiciated with this , I have never had a history of this before or after . For a 24 hour period after this my chest was hurting me as if i had over inflated my lungs.  These are the only three episodes of this type in my history.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous.  PD))<n>

I know it was in the 90s and I was In Junior high school.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was in my yard about to cross the street to go to a neighbors house when I saw a bright reddish sphere with an orange tint.  It was floating over my friends house and completely still.  It did not seem far away and did not make a sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I stopped dead in my tracks staring at it trying to figure out what it was.  I was in shock.  Before I had the chance to do anything else it took off to the left in a perfect line so fast and disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was the weirdest thing I&#39;ve seen in my life.  It wasn&#39;t a weather balloon or any other thing like that.  It was different.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I never told anyone because I did not want to be made fun of.

I was working as a conductor on a north/south frieght train in eastern Kansas.<n> <n><n> <n><n> One of our locomotives had suddenly died and I went back to try to restart it.  While looking out the window I saw a bright white beam of light shining down into a farmers field about a hundred yards to the east of our north bound train.  It reminded me of a police helicopter&#39;s search light that I&#39;d seen in the city except that it was rotating (spinning).<n> <n><n> <n><n> I couldn&#39;t see where the light was coming from because of the window awning on the locomotive so I stepped out on the trailing end of the locomotive to get a better look.  The beam had disappeared and something shot across the night sky like a shooting star.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The whole thing only lasted seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I restarted the engine and it ran perfect the rest of the trip.  The engineer never saw the light and thought I was crazy.<n>
1/1/95 02:00|El Granada|CA|Fireball|45 seconds|Glowing fireball  object crashed at Maverick's Beach|11/4/02|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/025/S25864.html|93|ndxe199501| Large, dark, silent, graceful object with lights seen moving up canyon<n> <n><n> <n><n> We (friend and myself) were coming down the mountain after finishing up some work on a bed &amp; breakfast project.  We were at a point in the canyon that begins to open up (and eventually turns into flat desert about three or four  miles further ahead of where we say the object.) The night was clear.  There was enough natural light from the stars that you could see the cabins and ranches though not much detail.  The other side of the canyon terrain was visible.  It wasn&#39;t &#34;pitch dark.&#34;<n> <n><n> <n><n> All of a sudden we noticed movement in the canyon just ahead of us.  We could not make out WHAT we saw because the object was dark.  There was an eery silence.  We both saw it and slowed down to view it. It was in the center of the canyon heading in the direction (into the canyon) that we were leaving.  The massive size of the thing was what struck us as odd, not to mention having no idea as to what we were looking at because it was too big to be going into that area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We slowed the Suburban down to watch it.  It was silent, we could see the outline of it due to the way it blocked out everything.  In other words, we could see where it wasn&#39;t because the background of the canyon was illuminated enough to outline it.  It was as if this thing absorbed light because there was no reflection from it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We both asked one another &#34;what is that?&#34;  It had lights at the front and back.  Just small lights.  It moved in a graceful manner with simialr motions to that of a helicopter (up, down, sideways, forward backward).  There was no sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I remember thinking it reminded me of the Hindenburg photos I have seen though it did not look &#34;balloon-like&#34;.  This thing seemed solid.  Just the shape reminded me of it though this was a bit more oval instead of &#34;cigar-shaped&#34; as I would refer to the Hindenburg.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We watched it for a mile or so and then when we looked back again it was gone. There was no way it could have gone into the canyon any further as the canyon narrows.  It was too large.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were probably a quarter of a mile from it when we passed it.  Trying to give an idea of its size is difficult.  Maybe the size of a DC-10 jet (if you drew an oval around the jet that is.)<n> <n><n> <n><n> I remember being strangely aware of the eerie feeling though not fearful.  We both just looked at each other and agreed &#34;that was weird.&#34;<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have been told by skeptics that &#34;oh, it was a weather balloon.&#34;  I disagree though I have no other answer than to explain what I saw.<n>
