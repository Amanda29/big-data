We did not see the first lights but a few minutes later the lights appeared again. We all noticed the lights this time. They were at about a 45 degree angle from the horizon. They were two lights about the size of street lights. Although they were not street lights. The lights were to high in the sky and we were between cities. They would come on at the same time but at times they went out together and at times one would dim out first. The total time they were on was about 4-8 seconds. I could see airplane lights in the sky and they looked like dots compared to the lights. I am not sure what they were. It was a clear night as we could see the stars in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was an orbe in the sky which had me thinking &#34;am I really seeing this&#34;, because I was driving I took one last look at the road then quickly looked back at this unusual object in the sky. It was dark in the sky so this object was clear as day 2 me. I watched as this one orbe stayed in its spot and trasformed into two orbs about 20 feet away from each other. It was like the 1 one duplicated itself into 2 orbs of light. After that the 2 orbs faded away in its darkness. This made me want to reverse my car and see if I could see the attraction again but nothing was there.... I don&#39;t know what I saw, I know human error is always a factor but this was seen right in front of my own eye&#39;s and I still can&#39;t believe it...<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

11/30/05 14:44|Charlottesville|VA|Other||Three Deer Mutilated in Virginia in 2005|11/28/07|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/059/S59644.html|6|ndxe200511| Three Deer Mutilated in Virginia in 2005<n> <n><n> <n><n> The following day, heading back out to the cabin with a friend who had come with me to help me box my last things at my cabin on Isolina Lane, at precisely 2:22 PM we drove past the 1st half of a deer laying on the road, exactly .2 miles from the cabin, on Isolina Lane. It was nearly in the middle of the road, facing the road, almost as if left on display.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We stopped, and I approached the carcass with the intention of doing an amateur forensics discussion for the benefit of my friend, essentially to show that the power of deduction and observation could be handily used to determine the likely cause and time of death. As I rattled off my observations to him like some amateur Quincy Jones, I realized with horror that this was NOT a poached animal, nor the victim of any predator I had ever seen or heard of.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Close examination of the manner in which the vertebrae were severed indicated that neither metal laceration nor laser could explain the nature of the cuts. I had only seen these types of seperations of tissue with one device- and a very expensive one- a sonic scalpel.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We then discovered the second deer carcass, at the edge of the forest line, and then the third, further into the forest, each two meters from the last, all in a strait line pointing to the middle of the south end of the Carter Moutain ridge.  All were turned inside out, all had their upper abdomenal organs removed, all the rib cages were so denuded of cartilage and flesh it appeared that they had been vacuumed clean, and the tiny spot of blood the size of a quarter or a dime underneath the carcass left on the road indicated a state of congealment indicative of the kill being no more than a half hour previous to discovery.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Nevertheless, the stiffness of the first deer half propped upright on the road was almost as if it&#39;s flesh had been highly stiffened by some kind of freeze-dried process, though, of course, there was no freezer burns. I cut the flesh with a pocket knife to ascertain if blood would emerge and investigate the stiffness of the flesh itself. There was no blood, the flesh cut easily.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In the weeks that followed, I began to lose an enormous amount of weight and began to suffer from a rapid deterioration of *every* system of my body. I barely survived, but by the next February, my weight and health returned.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This was a highly lethal, highly advanced technology used to mutilate those deer in Charlottesville Virginia.  This needs to be examined and reviewed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date of incident may be approximate, although the witness does not indicate that fact.  We have requested more information from the source of the report.  PD))<n>

I have seen numerous satellites in the past and know that these did not have an equatorial path as they each split up going different ways till they got to the centre of cygnus then vanished.I also know they were not of military origin as i keep upto date with all military exercises and these were too high anyway. Unfortunaetly i thought id have picked them up on my DSLR but theres no trace on the pictures .Can anyone tell me if anyone else seen the same observation<n>

But look very similiar.  They just look like a yellow light in the sky and sometimes they are really close and sometimes spread apart.  I see them as I am driving home at night about 7-9pm.  They are above, not high.  As I am driving home on the freeway, about 20 miles away, they disappear and show up about 5 miles more down.  Of course it probably is farther, because these lights are farther out, I only see the light, I havent seen an object yet.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

11/29/05 15:15|Columbus|OH|Cylinder|1 minute|Long cylinder shaped UFO sighted along I-70 near Columbus Ohio.|5/15/06|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/049/S49561.html|12|ndxe200511| Long cylinder shaped UFO sighted along I-70 near Columbus Ohio.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This sighting occured on the east side of Columbus while driving at approx. 3:15pm on Nov 29 2005. I was driving in an area where I had driven on numerous occasions. I was driving on the outerbelt around Columbus (I-270) traveling north. I was comming up to the overpass crossing over I-70 which runs east and west through Columbus. Being the outerbelt is generally speaking circular my perspective of the object was in continual change while I was moving. I looked east along I-70 and noticed a stationary object approx. 1/4 mile from the overpass. It was sitting just above the tree line slightly to the north of I-70. I at first thought that I was looking at a very large waving banner that was attached to something. I had never seen this in that location before. It was very promonent. I quickly realized that I was looking at a solid object that had a rippling appearance moving along its surface, moving from west to east and going around it. The object was sitting parallel to I-70 maybe 50 feet above the trees. It had the appareance of being a long pipe parallel to the ground, being somewhat longer than a tractor trailer rig and maybe 5 feet tall. I slowed down to look at it but couldn&#39;t pull over and stop on the overpass because I had traffic comming up on my rear. This is the point where the situation gets really interesting because just beyond the the I-70 overpass is an underpass for a road that parallels I-70 just to its north and as I approach this underpass I notice a dark blue and/or black helicopter with no markings circling the overpass. I assume that the chopper can see the object but looking straight east now I can no longer see it. From this perspective I would now be looking at it&#39;s west end. I at this point look into my rear view mirror and see a dark blue sedan of matching color right behind me. It appeared to be a current model unmarked Chevy Impala that had a beacon on top.(the beacon wasn&#39;t on and may have been some type of detection equipment for all I know) The beacon and it&#39;s lenses and the windows of the car matched the color of the car so it&#39;s interior could&#39;t be seen. As I passed under the road crossing over I-270 the sedan pulled over and stopped under the underpass that the helicopter was circling. I must comment about the synchronistic aspects of this happening. This was my third non disk shaped close UFO encounter but the only one I have reported.(the other two encounters were actually closer as I was right under them) I have had four other encounters with the black helicopters but had nothing to do with UFO&#39;s. I appeared to be the focus of their attention. At the time of this happening I was scheduled to go to the UFO conference three days later in Virginia beach at the A.R.E.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

At approximately 10:45p.m. I went out to cover my plants. When I was covering my lemon tree I saw something strange in the south west sky. It was maybe a half mile away, floating low in the sky. It was a sharp angle with a wing with a lip around the edge. It seemed very peculiar. I even looked away and when I looked back it was still floating slowly with no noise or lights. It was not a large air craft, but the color seemed clear or iridescent. The most vivid thing was how it just disappeared. It wasn’t like a blink. It was more like a smoke, fading away slowly. I have never seen any thing ever in my life like it. It’s hard to explain how incredible this was. I’m a normal person, married suburban life with two kids. I’ve never seen anything move like that and just disappear. To be frank it scared the shit out of me.<n>

At first my mother thought it was the North Star, but then we realized that the light was in the Western sky. We began to look at it more closely, and to our amazement, it appeared to be slowly shifting back and forth as well as downward.At this point we decided to look at it through our binoculars. The light appeared through the binoculars to be a bright white light at first , but as it slowly descended, the color changed to more of a yellow light near the bottom, with a definite red light near the side, and a faint blue light on top.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We continued to watch this light for over 2 hours as it slowly descended from high in the sky, to just above the tree tops. At this point we decided to get in the car to get a better view before it disappeared behind the trees. As we traveled down the  road we kept looking up to try to find the light. At first we couldn&#39;t see it, so we thought we had passed it because of the trees blocking our view. We then turned around, went back up the road, and saw the light, so we decided to turn on a side road to get a better view. We pulled off the side of the road to look at it. After looking at it for only a few seconds, the light quickly faded out followed by several red blinks of light, and then nothing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At this point another bright light caught our attention in the Southeastern sky. We quickly took out the binoculars to get a better look at it. To our amazement the lights were the same as the lights we had witnessed previously. We then drove back home, keeping our eyes on the light. When we got home, we got out of the car, and looked at the sky in the same direction and there it was. At this point, another bright light caught our attention directly above us  that was even brighter and closer. We looked at it through the binoculars and saw that it had the same type of lights. As we gazed at the night sky we spotted 5 more of these strange lights throughout the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> *It should be noted that these lights at first glance appear to be bright stars. Only after careful observation does one notice that these lights are not stars.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was very dense, and Nassau is almost never in any fog, and the season is not appropriate for that at all. Interestingly the fog cleared and to the right in the sky the clouds had formed what looked like a spiraling circle around a black hole in the middle... And very strangely sparks of lightning with no sound! At least 10 other drivers must have seen it. Some people walked out of their cars! I thought the end of the world had come! But it strangely, what looked like a hole began to close within the next few minutes. I was going to kill myself for not keeping my camera on me at all times. And it is a 10 megapixel one at that! And then it all vanished; everything cleared. No fog... Gone as it had come. Some of the drivers stared at each other for a good while after. There is no way I am sleeping tonight. Witnesses could be a lot more than 10, but at least 10 around me!<n>

The light wasn&#39;t very high from the ground, as it appeared not too far from the tree line sillouette.  The light was bigger than I could associate with any aircraft, so I told my wife to watch it too.  As I told her this, the green light started to move, as it appeared, in an eastern direction, parallell to I-95.  Suddenly the the light seemed to accelerate to extreme speed as it quickly vanished towards the east.  This is when I realized I have witnessed something extraordinary.  My wife failed to notice the object, so I was left with my own experience, which lasted no more than a couple of seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

To my surprise the bright light was a ball of white light in the middle with a light at north east south and west. there was a gat between the ball and the other lights which made it look like a cross with a ball of light in the middle. I woke my wife who then agreeded after looking at the light that we were looking at something strange. Later it went into two rings one at the top and one on the bottom. it later went to one ball and went up into the night sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

Flat trajectory with wobble, did not flare like meteor.<n> <n><n> <n><n> While enjoying the dark night sky approximately 1 mile west of Maryhill, WA I witnessed what at first I thought was a meteor except that once it was over I said to myself, &#34;that was no meteor,&#34; for the following reasons:  object remained at a consistant brightness from the time I first saw it to when it disappeared in the clouds near Mount Hood; and it had a flat, not arced, trajectory with bit of a waffle midway-kind of like a curve ball.  Also rather than being bright like most meteors, it was fairly dim, though appeared self-illuminating and a gold or amber color.  Overall it somewhat resembled a spark from a campfire though traveling very high and very fast.  There was also what appeared to be a westbound (Seattle?) commercial airliner in the sky very close to where I first saw it; the airplane lights were much brighter.  (I would not be suprised if people on the aircraft saw it.  The object traveled from overhead (approx highway US97) to the horizon (Mount Hood)in one second or less, a straight-line distance I would estimate to be about 50 miles.   It seemed to be travelling at several thousand feet in elevation not unlike commercial aircraft;  I believe it did produce a slight glow in the clouds underneath as it passed through or over them.  When the object waffled, I got the impression that it had done a roll or rotated laterally in flight.  Weather was cool; temps in the low 40s; sky was clear (no haze) with some patchy clouds. Oddest thing I have seen in the sky in 22 years.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I am just trying to figure out what it could be. I was in my car, driving about 30 MPH and I was the only car on the road. I was in the city and it was too cloded to see any stars at all. I just saw this white speck.It looked a lot like a light on a faraway airplane...very bright, white light.I couldnt really tell how far up it was but it traveled in a trajectory from right over my car straight in the direction I was facing and behind the buildings in front of me. It was only visible for a second or two, so it must have been traveling some incredible speed, Id say 10-20 times faster than an airplane. There was no sound and no trail. I second guessed myself that it was some reflection on the window but really I could tell that it was not, I saw it very clearly and its velocity seemed to change perfectly inverse with its distance. Considering downtown was roughly to my left it seems it was traveling west.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

11/26/05 05:30|Greensburg|KY|Changing|1 hour|Multiple lights seen in the sky including erratic movement.|3/11/06|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/049/S49383.html|43|ndxe200511| Multiple lights seen in the sky including erratic movement.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;m writing to report sightings on 2 different nights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 1st in November: I work night shift and was coming home (about 5:30 am Eastern time) when I saw what looked like a shooting start right in front of me and it ended behind some trees. When I turned onto my road (I was driving south on the road) my eyes scanned the sky to see if I could see any other shooting stars when I saw a pretty bright orangish-yellow light in the Western sky and I thought it was an unusually bright star. Once I got home and got out of my car (only 1/2 mile down from where I first saw the object) I could not see it anymore in the sky. There was a clear view from that point as my home is on a hill and there were no trees or clouds in the way. I thought this was strange. When I turned to the Eastern sky I could see what looked like the blinking lights of a plane going from North to South, but what was strange was the object flying about 2 thumbs widths underneath the plane. It was a large object, about twice the size of the plane, but glowed a dull orange color and kept up with the plane. I watched it until both of them disapeared trying to figure out what the orange thing was. I still have no idea.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After this I went inside where I saw my husband and told him what I saw. He just shrugged it off. I then went into my kitchen which has windows facing both North and West. Looking out one of the windows facing the west I saw another dull orange object low in the horizon, similar to what I saw following under the plane. However this one was stationary and very low and looked a bit bigger. Below it were the 2 yard lights that I see through the trees everynight that a neighbor on the other hill has on. This orange light was about twice the size of one of the white yard lights and a bit higher than them and was above the tree line back there. The orange light started to change after a bit and would change into a red color, and when it did this it would get smaller almost like it was going further in the distance (further west) and then it would grow again and become the dull orange color. It did this a few times over a 5 minute period, during which time my husband did come to the window to look at it, and finally went to a red that just faded to nothing. Neither my husband or I have any idea what this could have been.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My husband went to the bedroom to get ready for bed and I sat there waiting to see if the light would come back when I saw a small flash out of the corner of my eye a bit to the north (but still in the western sky) of where I was looking and there was a yellow light/star again in about the same spot the very first one I had saw when I was driving home would have been if it had still been there. This light started moving to the east and I had to move to the other window in my kitchen that faces north to keep track of it. When the object was almost due north of us it changed from a dull orange-yellow to a rapid flickering that red/blue/white could be seen in.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Due to the red and blue I was wondering if maybe this was just a plane, but soon this flickering light grew in size and became even more rapid and chaotic and the flight path became erratic bouncing up, down or short bursts forward at times. Then once it reached the northeast sky it changed back to a smaller glowing dull yellow-orange and came to a stop. At this point another small flash in the north western sky caught the attention out of the corner of my eye - seemed to be the exact place the other objects came from. It also immediately took the same path as the previous one when another flash again caught the corner of my eye and I could see yet another dull yellow light moving to the east. The flashes I never saw straight on - they were out of the corner of my eye. By this time my husband was back to watch and he also witnessed the two new yellow objects going across the northern sky from the west to east. Neither of these became erratic like the first one, but they both stopped in near the previous one in the northeast sky. One then continued on to the Southeast changing to a dull red and I lost sight of it out of the window. I moved to another room to watch it but I found it just in time to see it fade away. The other two didn&#39;t move and just sat there looking like two stars - And I would have believed they were if I hadn&#39;t seen them moving to that point earlier. I watched them for about 10 minutes before finally going to bed around 6:40 AM.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 2nd in January: Driving home from work, again about 5:30 am Eastern an orange object caught my attention in the North sky.  It was lower and closer than the the objects in November and below the tree line.  It was more a cylinder shape with a sharper outline.  It glowed a dull orange.  I slowed to watch it but it didn&#39;t move so I continued on home - which wasn&#39;t far away.  When I got home I looked for it and it was there, now above the tree line and brighter, but not as distinct in shape as before - it looked rounder, so I&#39;m not even sure if it was the same thing, though it was in the same area.  My husband also saw this one as I called him to come look at it.  The thing sat there in the sky for a few minutes and then started to bounce up and down in an erratic motion.  I kept asking &#34;what the heck can move like that?&#34; as it was even more erratic than the things I saw in November.  After about 3-5 minutes it settled down and stilled.  Then it slowly moved to the west before dimming out.  It left a smaller and duller red light that blinked twice before completely dissapearing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What the heck could these things be??  We do live in a high-air traffic area, but planes are pretty easy to identify.  There have also been other times where we had slow moving orange lights, but nothing compared to these two incidents.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.

The Friday after the holiday, the three of us drove to the nearest city, Greenville, to do some Christmas shopping and to see a movie.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Greenwood is a small city in a rural part of Upstate South Carolina, and the part of Highway 25 we were on is fairly isolated. There are a few homes here and there, but not a lot of development. Consequently, the road is quiet and on a clear night like the one in question, the stars are clearly visible.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Around 10:30 or 11 p.m., I pointed out to my dad that the star on the horizon was particularly clear and beautiful, and he looked and said that while it was very pretty, he thought it was a planet because it looked too bright and large to be a star. My mom said that whatever it was, it looked awfully weird. The closer we got, the stranger it looked. I suggested that it might be a cell phone tower, and my dad disagreed, because the light on a cell phone tower would be red, and this light was white, like a star. That&#39;s when I realized that the object had changed positions in the sky. It had moved from the right side of the sky -- the passenger side, based on my position in the car -- to the left side of the sky, and it was definitely getting larger and closer.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It&#39;s difficult for me to estimate how many miles we drove until it was directly overhead, but curiosity got the better of us in the little town of Ware Shoals, which is about 20 miles from Greenwood. My dad pulled into the median in front of the Burger King and he and I got out of the car and looked up.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A large triangular craft slowly floated over us. Size in feet is hard for me to estimate and it&#39;s been a little while since this happened. I don&#39;t want my memory to inflate the measurement, but it was definitely larger than your average low-flying plane. If the sun had been out, it would have cast a shadow that would have covered me, my dad and his SUV. If I had put my hands above my head to blot it out of my vision, I couldn&#39;t have done it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The craft was black and shaped like an equilateral triangle with rounded corners. There were bluish-white lights at each corner and a red light on each of the three sides between the bluish-white lights. It didn&#39;t make any sound at all and it floated at an even pace right over the tops of the pine trees. It seemed to be so close to the tops of the trees that I thought it might brush them as it passed over.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I know very little about military aircraft, but I looked up photos of stealth planes later to see if I could find what we saw. It wasn&#39;t a B-2, I&#39;m sure of it, because B-2s have a W-shape in the back and what we saw was a solid triangle. It wasn&#39;t a Nighthawk either. Both of those planes are too angular. I&#39;m absolutely certain the corners of the triangle were rounded.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When it passed over -- it didn&#39;t shoot off at Warp 9 or anything, it just floated over the trees and out of sight -- my dad and I got back in the car. Less than a minute elapsed between the time we stopped the car and the time we got back in. I asked him what we had just seen and he said he didn&#39;t know, which surprised me because he&#39;s always been interested in military technology. We didn&#39;t talk much until we got home. We haven&#39;t discussed it since.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Recently, I described the sighting to my boyfriend&#39;s father, a retired engineer who developed the engines for the B-2 and the F-117. He said that what I was describing did not match the description of any of our known stealth aircraft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am a graduate of Clemson University and I hold a Bachelor of Arts in communication. At the time of the sighting, I worked as a newspaper reporter. I am now employed at an advertising agency as a copywriter. My father holds a Bachelor of Science in business and is a retired executive of a multinational agricultural biotechnology corporation. My mother is a high school graduate and a homemaker.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

There was no sound and it appeared above me and disappeared behind the tree tops to the South-west of my location. It appeared to be falling in the direction of Piscataway NJ.  I thought that it could be a meteor except it was so large it was the size of the moon when it is huge and full in the sky.  It was a distinct circle just like as if the moon was falling out of the sky but it was a bright green color with a tail. It happened very fast.  There were about 4 or 5 airplanes traveling in different directions in the night sky at this time. I hope others witnessed this as well, Please let me know.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Visability was very good.I was sitting out, staring up at the sky in one area, and saw a satelite go by, i am assuming.. could have been a plane? Not real sure but it passes the same path every night. With the little dipper above, handle pointing down, a round oval blur, looked a deep gray (maybe)but with a light luminece to it, not at all bright, passed below the lil dipper, making a straight path to pass below Orions belt which was from the direction i was looking, was lower than the lil dipper to my right. I am thinking SE?..  It moved at a very steady, smooth pace.. but was quicker than a plane. No lights or sound. Holding my arm out it was probably the size of my thumb nail? I thought maybe a bird, questioning myself, considering different options, but i dont think a bird could move at that speed. It didnt appear to have a sharp edge.. it appeared blurred, but again with the color and the speed and with the night sky, thats would be hard to detect. I mentioned a luminence, only reason i say that is because i was able to follow it clearly across the sky, until it got around orions belt where i couldnt see it any more. Shooting star? No, again there was no real light, just a kind of very low almost unnoticable glow? If i wasnt looking to see something, i never would have caught its movement i dont think. It came from corner of my field of vision and shot across. I was kinda in awe when i saw it, as this would be the 4th time i have seen something of this nature in my lifetime.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am 34 yrs old, single mom of two, Associates degree in Med Admin. I am honest and realistic, not one to give into fantasy.  I debated whether i should report it, whether it would be of any import?   All i can say is ...

I saw a triangle-v shape object drop from the night sky a hundred yards or so into the path of the road I am travelling. Huge bright lights along the triangle shape craft started to have a relaxing affect on me as I slow the vehicle from 50 miles to a crawl when my large dog came from the rear of my van to the front passenger seat barking protectively. The craft hovering left the road area and began to hover on the driver side of the vehicle several feet in the sky in full bloom of these green, blue , red lights maybe 15feet wide each. then the craft flip a few time then headed away from the vehile. I was engage with making the van move quicker in fear and thankful for my dog pulling me out of the trance. I found it difficult to drive away from the craft being amazed of what I saw.

About 15 of us were in the kitchen when the lights dimmed, grew incredibly bright, then went out completely. At the same time the lights went out, we heard a massive explosion.  Four of us ran out to the front porch to see bright neon blue smoke in the sky with electricity arcing over the blue hue about 1 1/2 blocks away.  My mom who was standing next to me said, &#34;Is that an ash floating over the smoke?&#34; as she pointed to it.  We all saw it at the same time - 4 bright white lights come through the smoke - it was off in the distance, behind the trees but above the roof line of the houses directly across the street from us.  We could see 4 bright white round lights - not blinking, bright as car headlights. They were a diamond shape. It was narrow in the middle, long on the ends - basically an elongated diamond, maybe somewhat of the chevron shape.  The lights headed in a southern direction.  We live less than 1 mile from the beach and these lights were over the ocean.  The explosion had knocked all the power out in a 4-6 block radius.  It was eerily silent - the lights made no sound what so ever.  Standing on the porch observing all this was me, my mom and dad, and a good friend/son-in-law of the family who is a NJ State Trooper.  As we watched the lights, in pretty much a stunned silence, we saw them start to shift shape - the rear light moved forward and the diamond narrowed.  It started to slow, passed behind a light cloud, dimmed, then slightly dipped as it sped off in an east-south-east direction.  The entire siting lasted about a minute and a 1/2.  This was not a plane, there were no blinking red, green or white lights. There was no sound of an engine - it was silent. We have a military base that is about 25 miles inland from us and these lights were like no flight path I&#39;ve ever seen any military plane follow.  These lights came from the north heading south along the beach, then completely stopped, and then sped off over the ocean.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Years have past and I have only now decided to report what I saw so the date and time maybe not accurate, but have recently decided to see if anyone else had reported on your web site what I had seen and to my surprise other people have reported the same thing around the same time and place.  This is what happened.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I left a friends house in the down town part of Santa Barbara , I think sometime between 9pm and 11pm on Thanksgiving to drive back to my house in Ventura.  The parking lot directly behind his house was surrounded by trees, 2 and 1 story houses.  I walked to my car and just gave a glance up to look at the stars as I normally do on a beautiful Santa Barbara,CA nights when I noticed that there were no stars, but just a very odd light that was dull orange in color, it was bright, but gave off no hue as bright lights do.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I then took in a wider perspective and noticed that there was not 1, but 3 of these strange orange lights.  They were aprox. a 100 yards between each light forming a perfect or near perfect triangle.  One single light at the front and  the other 2 light were at the back.  On the outside of the triangle lights I could see the stars, house and street lights, etc., but between the orange lights it was black, therefore the triangle was solid.  The triangle &#34;UFO&#34; moved south to north aprox. 20 to 30mph and was aprox. 100-150 ft. above me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What really struck me was that a moving flying craft that large and that low with orange lights that I still have not seen since, made no noise as it went overhead, It was completely silent.  As soon I lost sight of it, I got in my car and tried to find it again, but could not.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have been around airports and military compounds all my life (39 yrs) and have never seen a flying vehicle that had the shape, lights, and audio characteristics of this &#34;UFO.&#34;<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.

We were a few miles out of town when I noticed a very large light in the sky very low on the horizon.  My husband dismissed it at first as an airplane or a helicopter but by the time we arrived home about 30 minutes later he was convinced this was something out of the ordinary.  This light was extremely bright (almost hard to look at directly for any length of time).  It seemed to hover in the same spot.  I ran in the  house to get my video camera and when I came back out my family and I witnessed it as it just disappeared.  It was almost as if someone turned off a light.  It was just gone.  I am really curious to know if anyone else in my area happened to see this light.  I spoke to my parents this morning and they commented that about an hour after we left their house (about the time we would have arrived home) they heard several what they said sounded like helicopters go over their house.  They ran out to see them but when they got outside they noise immediatly stopped.  I don&#39;t know if this is related to what we saw or not.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I thought it was probably an airliner, but it didn&#39;t blink different colorslike they usually do - it was a steady white light.  What is really odd is that it suddenly disappeared.  I was following its path, and it should not have been out of sight if it had continued on a direct path.  Very odd.  Do not know if anyone else is seeing something and then &#34;not seeing something&#34;.  It is really only noteworthy due to its sudden disappearance and lack of similarity with other aircraft lighting.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The light erradically moved in multiple directions and different velocities (sometimes startlingly fast), yet remained in the general locale originally observed. The object waxed and waned in intensity and color. At one point, a helicopter ventured over to the area, when the object quickly moved in its direction resulting in the chopper making a quick evasive manuveur. At that point, the object broke-off and returned to its former erratic movements including a &#39;falling leaf&#39; pattern. Its size was difficult to estimate, but smaller than the helicopter. I would characterize the movements as kite-like with the exception of the event with the helicopter. That seemed to demonstrate &#39;curiousity&#39;. The sighting lasted about 2 hours, off and on as it was a very cold night and we retreated into the camper for warmth, coming back out for observations.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

My brother called me as he was travelling through the desert with his wife and 5 year old daughter.  They had seen a light on or near the top of a mountain that began to &#39;fly&#39; in a northward direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At one point it shot several miles strait up and then disappeared.  It then returned to near it&#39;s original position and repeated the action.  He had called me on the phone and was describing the events as they happened.<n> <n><n> <n><n> He pulled over and about 15 other vehicles did the same.

I will send it along with additional details when I receive it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My brother described the light as being directional at times, but with no commercial aircraft attributes (ie no wing lights or strobes).<n>
11/23/05 21:00|Lee Vining|CA|Light|2.5 hours|Plasmic bluish white orb of light east of  Mono Lake.|6/12/08|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/063/S63064.html|73|ndxe200511| Plasmic bluish white orb of light east of  Mono Lake<n> <n><n> <n><n> The night was cold, moonless and clear. I was northeast of Lee Vining and while star gazing with a telescope I noticed a brillant light sitting on the ground appox 3 miles away near the east shore of Mono Lake.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It rose straight off the ground and began making slow circles in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Absolutely silent. At one point it passed over a mountain ridge to the east and lit up the entire ridge line so that every detail of the terrain could be seen. I later checked a topo map and this ridge was almost 12 miles away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was so brillant that I noticed that when it came within 3 miles of me that my body casted a shadow on the ground. I also had a pair of binoculars but the orb of light was just a bluish white plasmic blob. At no time did I ever see the red and green running lights that would readily identify it as an aircraft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At one point it was joined by a much smaller and dimmer orb of light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Through a pair of binoculars this orb also had no red or green running lights and made no sounds. They circled each other and made severl &#34;passes&#34; at each other. I eventually lost track of the smaller object and don&#39;t know what happened too it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After about 2.5 hours the large bright orb of light landed on the ground about three miles from me. I put all my scope gear on the backseat of my car, turned off the lights, and headed slowly down a dirt road directly towards the object. When I got within two miles of it, the dirt road dipped into a dry wash that was about 1/4 of a mile wide, and when I came up the other side of the wash the object was gone. I turned of the engine and stepped into the darkness but the object was gone. The only sound were several upset packs of coyotes howling in the darkness. THEY WERE SPOOKED AND SO WAS I.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have never reported this incident until now. I have seen a lot of strange lights in the sky after twenty years of star gazing but I could always explain them away. But this one has me baffled. At no time did I ever hear the tell tale noise of an aircraft engine. I am reporting it now because I noticed in your data of sightings that others at the same time camping near Bodie also saw the same thing but I was much closer. There had been several strong series of earthquakes in the area and I often wonder if what I observed were &#34;earthquake lights&#34;.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I stopped across the road from my house. I was about 200 feet away from some thing i had never dreamed of seeing. About 25 feet off the ground and right above my house was an aircraft about 300 feet long, and about 200 feet wide, 100 feet tall. This craft had the brightest lights i had ever saw, but did not hurt to look at them. There was 09 light in front, and 09 lights on the side i could see. I guess these lights to be 75 feet tall in the center, and got smaller as the lights got closer to the ends of this craft. I  saw the craft dip one corner down, i was sure it was going to hit my house. I blue my air horn to get my wife and sons attention, hoping they would run out side, and not get hurt in the house if it fell. When i looked back up the craft was gone, and my house was not damaged at all. I asked my wife if she had seen, or herd any thing, she said no. We went back out side ! so i could show them were i saw this craft, and at that moment 03 military aircraft appeared at tree top level in after burn,turning west right above my house. Think what you want, i know what i saw. I don&#39;t drink, or do drugs. thank you.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Shortly after leaving Franklin, we saw a very bright light from about 5 to 6 miles away high in the sky.  The light seemed &#34;wrong&#34;.  There were no flashing lights as you would see on an airplane.  As we drove the closer, the light was actually 2 lights.  Each light was round and fairly close together.  The craft appeared to be traveling North at a slow rate of speed at an altitude of 2000 to 4000 ft.  The lights seemed to show that the craft had a round front on it.  It was a very cold night with temperatures around 20F.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I consider my powers of observation very sound. As an interesting side note another person from the Kingston Ontario area also saw a noteworthy sighting around the same time, place, and date as reported on HBCCUFO.org website.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My sighting was a rather complicated event but basically  my attention was drawn to the night  sky initially due to display of Northern lights. This was around 7 pm.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Some minutes later I saw a very bright moving light approaching fairly quickly from the North/East which could easily be misperceived as a UFO. However this light eventually turned out to be what I believe was a conventional prop  aircraft---although one which I have never seen presenting such an intensely bright light nor such a large craft at such a low altitude. I believe it was a conventional craft as it appeared to have small blinking  red lights on the ends of both wings. Strangely it was silent until it began a banking turn and then I could hear the drone of the engines. But most noteworthy was the intense white light that must have been affixed somewhere up front. I say up front because after it banked and turned it was no longer visible but the smaller outside marker lights, as well as a couple more, were weakly seen. This intense illumination is the brightest  light I have seen in the sky besides several reentering meteors seen during meteor showers.<n> <n><n> <n><n> But the quality of the light was quite different.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Returned inside my house. Went back out with  video camera and observed a  patch of evenly illuminated light to the North which I took to be this prop plane which must have turned back again and then flew farther North of my position and then West while I was inside ( I surmise that but am not sure if it was the same craft). Diverted my attention and now this patch of light was due West and then much more South in what in retrospect must have been a very quick progression.  Not sure how it moved from North to South so quickly.  But I don&#39;t believe this was a UFO.  However what I caught on video next surely was. To make the story short....<n> <n><n> <n><n> After returning inside and back out again  I saw 2 light balls or orbs at about 1 km/half mile distance due North of me. They were in a line and  separated by about 30 feet and looked to be a few feet above the ground. First I took them to be lights from 2 cars--although brighter.  One had a reddish hue while the other was more white.<n> <n><n> <n><n> But they started to act &#34;strangely&#34;---appearing to move slightly up or down or forwards or backwards. Then one winked out and to cut to the chase the solitary remaining orb approached to about 300 feet away and appeared to be about tree top height.  It was quite bright and was a soft yellowish white in color.  The time it took to approach and then leave was less than a minute.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It is clearly discernible on tape. I never zoom the camera so its change in apparent size and luminosity shows it moved forward and then departed after some moments.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I took some video a few days later of the  same daytime setting and it helps to illustrate how this light had to be floating over a farm field.  As a final note I should add that this is not the first time I have witnessed strange aerial activity.  But this is the first time I have captured it on tape.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What I have observed is clear, what it is, is not.<n> <n><n> <n><n> If you require more info or want video please contact me via email.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Then it seemed like it was going faster because it flew right in front of me ,before it flew past the trees in my view I noticed that there where two crafts flying at the exact angle as the one in front or next two it, I was in my friends car and right when i saw that there  where two i rolled down my window and heard nothing. They where there and gone in seconds. My friend that was driving was inside a friends house and I was waiting in the driveway I told him right when he got in but im not sure he beleived me. I swear i saw two solid lights, no blinking like planes, these must have been crafts but i saw no shape of them and moved very fast . Other people had two have seen this they where flying pretty low and now that i think of it there was a new bridge just constructed where this happened in Franklin.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I drove at the beaming light for about maybe a mile trying to figure out what it was. When I drove past it, that&#39;s when I realized &#34; It&#39;s a U.F.O.&#34;.

A bright light caught the corner of my eye to the left.  I turned to see a massive ball of white light falling toward the earth.  I first focused on it when it was at about 45 degrees from my position.  It fell to what appeared to be about 15 degrees and then was not visible.  I believe the mountain range to the East would have precluded it from being a celestial event since it was visible at such a low angle to the ground.  Additionally, it appeared to be no more than a few miles away.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Easily four or five times the size of mars which is due north from this position and the craft or whatever it is, is located due south from this position. Conditions are very clear and cold and all stars are easily observed. This however is quite large stationary for at least fifteen minutes or more and slowly gyrated somewhat end over end slowly due north about a foot but still relatively over the base without much change in altitude  This appeared to be directly above and in between a natural gas extraction facility and a military special forces/Gendarme trainning base.<n>

At first I thought it was an aircraft, but it began to change speed and altitude too rapidly for conventional aircraft.  My friend started get scared, but I told him it had to be an airplane.  Soon it was obvious that the &#34;ship&#34; was actually 2 ships when they split off about 1000 feet above us.  When it started to descend we ran as fast as we could go back to the road.

And then it changed into a triangler UFO it was all red lighted with blue lights on the corner. And then it changed back into a circle UFO. It had again on the inside of the bottom red, yellow, and brown lights. And it emitted two more circle UFOS. They all had on the inside of the bottom red and yellow lights and emitted blue and purple beams. We sat off the INTERSTATE and watched these objects as they hovered over the car. Then we saw these UFOS get lower then higher and then we lost sight of them and couldn&#39;t see them no more. This was on November 22, 2005 on a Tuesday night at 9:45 P.M. It was very clear outside we didn&#39;t hear no sound we first saw these objects as we were driving on the INTERSTATE and we got off to watch these objects.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

While sitting on a patio chair I gazed at the stars. I noticed an orange &#34;star&#34; that was moving northward. It was too high to be a helicopter. I thought it may be a jet. But it was too high and bright. I saw a seemingly shooting star shoot up towards it but it burned once it was near it. It moved in a straight line then stood still for 3 minutes. Then it would move west and stand still again. The strange thing is a saw (for lack of a better word) sparks falling to earth fom this mobile star. They would look like a falling star very small and burn(perhaps at 30 feet in the air) before they would get close. As this unidentified objet continued I could see a shiny green color at it&#39;s center. My neck grew sore and I was scared with what ever was falling from the sky and evaporating. It was still there when I went inside my friends home.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It emitted red and yellow and orange and blue and purple beams. It was over our car and the lights were blinking. This was 11/22/2005 at 8:55 P.M. that night. We saw the object move to the west and we got gas and got cokes in the convenient store. We came out and still saw the object and then we lost sight of the object. It left a trial and a haze.

It was orange lighted with red vertical lines all around the sides. It had a blue light in the middle of the top and a blue light in the middle of the bottom. It was very scary and scared both of us. I&#39;ve never been so scared. So we got our fishing poles and chairs and went back to the car. We looked back at the lake and still saw the object. The object made no sound. Then it was gone and it was no where in sight. This happened on November 22, 2005 on a Tuesday night at 7:45 P.M.

It went west for about 10 mins. dropping sparks and getting lower the whole time and then went dark and looked like it fell in the ocean. After it went down we went to the bay and several fishermen saw the same thing but said that it made no noise and just fell straight in the ocean. They thought it was odd that there was no resuce atempt happening, we all thought it was a passanger plane on fire and where scared for the people both on the plane and on the ground.

The best way I can describe the lights is they looked like head lights.   I was stopped, getting ready to pull out onto the street so I wasn&#39;t moving, but it was hard to tell if the lights were moving, since it was windy (I couldn&#39;t tell of the lights were moving behind the trees, or if the trees were moving in front of the lights).   Down the road there is an &#34;S&#34; turn, so when I got to it looked to my left and I could see the lights a lot better.   Here&#39;s the brightness of the lights from left to right:   The first light was dim, the second light was the brightest, the third light was dimmer than the second but not by much, and the forth light was as dim as the first one.   I know airplane landing lights are white, but there really isn&#39;t an airport any where close to Quarryville.   I&#39;m guessing all of the lights were on the same thing, but I guess there could have been four different crafts flying in formation.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was just over the treelines of the horizon. It looked to be right over the backyard. It definitely had glimmering lights that were flashing and the lights colors were red, yellow, purple, blue, orange, green, pink, and white. At the beginning of the sighting, it was still outside and no stars were visible. I determined for certain that it was not a satellite, a meteor, a blimp, a comet, etc. Because they move and this object was stationary for about 25 minutes. I thought it may be the star sirius cause I know a little about astronomy and it is the brightest star in our constellations. But when I went outside to investigate further, I saw more signs that this was silver colored. Then the most amazing thing happened. I witnessed the object very quickly move to the northwest and then several seconds later returned exactly to where it was prior.  Then a couple of minutes elapsed and it suddenly moved very quickly further from my view in a frontwards motion.  It was no longer visible, which means it cannot be a star. I moved back further about twenty-five feet and up a slight hill in my backyard. I could see the object again. I think that the object was beeing operated by intelligent forces because of the way it moved so fast and deliberately. After a couple of more minutes the object retreated a distance into the north and I could no longer see it. It was a very weird experience this happened on November 22, 2005 it was a Tuesday night at 5:45 P.M. I couldn&#39;t believe what I saw in my backyard.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

About 100 foot across and not very high up. It looked like a brown, undulating curtain that was rather thick. It was noiseless and disappeared after a while. The dogs were barking at it.There&#39;s this satelite or something to the south-west of my place. When this thing passed by, this other object blazed up like it as on fire. (It has never done this before.)I contacted Nasa about it but they&#39;ve not had time to get back on it (if they will). The closest I could find in similarity was a trifid nebula but those are WAY up there and we were watching this with nothing other than the naked eye. Alien or no. It was pretty awesome! P.S. There was a giant silver pinball thingy around the same area, too, a few days ago. A jet was trailing it. So, I could do a visual size estimate. The ball thing was monsterous. Yet, both passed behind some clouds and I only got to watch for about 6 minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We have always seen weird sky things for years. Scott Airforce Base is about a 2-3 hour drive from here. Most of the stuff is probably theirs (even though it&#39;s odd looking).

This stretch of highway is about 10-15 miles north of Butte, MT. At approx. 2:20pm-2:30pm as I was climbing the winding pass up through Elk Park canyon I spotted 2 triangle shaped craft in the sky between 2 mountains. I was filled with a sensation of panic as soon as I spotted them because I knew what I was seeing was neither ordinary, nor something that I had seen before. Because I have no idea of the actual size of the craft, it is difficult to guage their altitude but they did appear to be flying higher than the mountains, and one craft appeared to be flying slightly higher than the other. The sun was bright that day and from the reflection of sunlight off of the craft they appeared to be chrome, they were very bright. At first glance the craft appeared to be stationary but after a few seconds of observation it looked like they were moving slowly towards the southwest. They also appeared to be moving much slower than any aircraft I have ever seen. It was a very cold day, yet the craft left no contrails as they moved. As I continued up the highway, my view of the craft was obscured as the road wound around a mountain side. I thought for sure I would have a clearer view of them another 1/2 mile or so up the road where the highway comes out of the canyon and opens up into plains, but when I got there they were gone. I thoroughly searched the sky for them and could not see them. They appeared to be moving southwest, and there were mountains a few miles south that I suppose they probably moved behind. There were other motorists on the highway that day but I&#39;m not sure if anyone else saw them. Judging from their position in the sky I would guess the craft would also have been visible from another highway further south than the one I was on.(Homestake Pass, the highway from Butte MT to Whitehall MT) I did not observe any other aircraft in the sky at the time. I did not notify the police or any other authorities, but I felt that what I saw was so unusual that I should notify someone.By the way I am a ((deleted)) worker for the State of Montana, Department of ((deleted)).<n>

I noticed an unusually bright white light that appeared to be hovering between Orion&#39;s Belt and Sirius.  What caught and held my attention were the smaller lights that periodically went on and off in all directions radiating from the bright white light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At approximately 03:35 an airplane passed across the sky from west to east and it appeared to fly behind the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As a geologist,  I mapped the constellations, the airplane&#39;s trajectory and the object (as well as the approximate location of the flickering lights in relation to the main, larger white light) so that I could estimate the size of the object if ever I was interested enough to attempt to track down the airplane&#39;s distance from my home.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After putting together my scaled figure, I went to bed.

To the NNE, I could see what I thought was an aircraft headed south at approximately the same relative altitude as the rising moon from my ground perspective.  The bright white light which appeared to be the same intensity as a small aircraft&#39;s and about the size of a pencil eraser held at arms length, also appeared to have red light in a halo effect around the white light but at a greatly reduced size and barely discernable from the white light.  I estimated the &#34;aircraft&#34; to be approximately ½ mile away from me based on numerous other aircraft sightings over the years of airplanes flying overhead en route to our local airport.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I watched the &#34;aircraft&#34; for approximately (1) minute and realized that it&#39;s lateral speed was slowing and it was now turning further west towards my location which could account for the illusion of it slowing down.  Although it still had the red halo effect, I realized that it was not an aircraft rotating beacon or navigation light.  I then called to my wife and twenty year old son to come outside and we watched for (1) minute more as the object began to slowly weave left to right and began to drop in altitude. The white light dimmed slightly and then it suddenly dropped what appeared to be (3) red fragments much like flares dropped by jet fighter aircraft.  The object zig-zagged left to right and still continued to drop in altitude headed south.  It emitted (3-4)red fragments and appeared to turn due east.  Its size continued to reduce which led me to believe it was moving away from me.  It was also appeared to reduce in size every time it emitted the fragments.  It finally disappeared altogether which left my family and I, awe struck.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have been a patrol sergeant with a local law enforcement agency for almost twenty years and have observed several missile launches from Vandenberg AFB which is approximately (200) miles SE of me.  The launches leave a visible smoke trail from my town and sometimes I can see the booster separations and engine burns, if the sky is clear.  I have also observed dozens of space junk re-entries, satellites including Iridium flares, and orbiting spacecraft, but I have never seen an object perform as this one did tonight.  It went from controlled navigation to weaving like a drunk driver and then straighten itself back out in seconds.  I have seen jet aircraft drop flare counter measures before and they have a systematic ejection, controlled decent and separation.  These fragments did not.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have a Navel Air Station approximately (30) miles west of me and FA-18 Hornets fly overhead day and night.  They are flying over to the China Lake and Nellis AFB test ranges, so I&#39;m accustomed to the sounds they make, the navigation lights they have and the speeds they transit our airspace at.  This object had no sound and from the estimated distance and the fact that it was after 2300 hours, it was quiet.  There was no sound, no explosion, no smoke and unlike anything I had ever experienced before in real life.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We believe it was a UFO.<n>

Around midnight me and two of my friends went to the liqour store to buy some alcohol. We came back to my house had a few drinks and then we went outside to smoke a couple ciggerettes in my backyard.  We put on some music and drank a bit more, suddenly i heard a loud pop or a snap as if something busted throught the Earth&#39;s atmosphere, it seems I was the only one of us three that heard the loud snapping sound. Anyways as soon as I heard the extremely loud snap I immediatley looked up towards the sound and there it was, a white dot quietly soaring throught the air.  After I looked at it my friends yelled out, Holy Shit!&#34; look!  while I was already looking, we all watched it for about 10 seconds and it disappeared.  The way it was moving was like not possible, it was literally teleporting in front of our eyes in a triangular motion then it disappeared.  We then argued about what we saw all night but no one else we knew saw it but us.  It was very eerie being the only one who heard the popping sound and looked immediately towards it. I should really carry a video camera around from now on...<n> <n><n> <n><n>

We were about 5-10 minutes from Stanstead and I was bored so anything could catch my eye, my dad on the other hand was focusing on driving.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I caught the glare of what I thought was a particularly bright room light in a house maybe.  But as I looked at it I noticed it was formed in a Diamond like shape.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Still, in greatly moronic fashion I turned to my dad and said, &#34;Wow, odd they have windows on that house like that.&#34;<n> <n><n> <n><n> My dad turned his head to see what exactly I was so amazed by.  As I saw his eyes widen I returned my view to the house.  But I then realized it was only 4 lights, and 2 new ones were floating off to the right of the diamond shaped Alignment.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Just as quickly as I caught sight of it the diamond figure began to seemingly shrink, but im no idiot and my grasp upon physics and relative distance is fairly good.  What was really happening was it began to distance itself from me.  Originating at about 50 yards from me.  Heading towards 1 O&#39;Clock.<n> <n><n> <n><n> But the bizarre part was that the 2 lights I hadnt noticed at the beggining remained there, and stedfast. Just as I took grasp of what this, we had been blinded by a wall of trees next to us. We continued onward and shortly after noticed a Jet flying over into the U.S. border.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My dad knew the area quite well.  He had driven those roads for ages, and the trail that led to where the supposed house was, was really a logging trail, no houses.  Im just as stumped as you…<n>

They had no wings or any source of flight, they flew in a pair of two, They appeared to be organic! . 		 	  On November 20, 2005 about  2130 pm I was driving my 1997 Toyota Land Cruiser North on Hwy 280 passing Palo Alto, California. I had just passed the Stanford Linier accelerator on my left witch is west just before the Sand Hill blvrd off ramp overpass.. I was driving approximately, 75 MPH and I opened both of my front windows to get some fresh air. Within A few seconds these two dark brown, almost black spherical creatures the size of golf balls, flying at a high rate of speed, hit or lets say collided into my left temple with a velocity that felt like they were passing right through my head and out the front passenger window.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So I rolled up my windows and kept driving until I got home in San Francisco about 10:00 pm. As I got out of my truck I went around to the front passenger side to get my suite case out, so as I opened the door  to my surprise one of those creatures flew out and bolted up into the night sky. The next morning I thought about telling my room mates before I went to work but I didn’t think they would believe me, so went out to my truck with my work gear that goes in the front passenger side of my truck and opened the door, and to my surprise the other creature bolted out and flew up into the sky. There was a person walking by my truck as this happened and saw it fly away and he looked at me with a puzzled look on his face and I said I did not know what it was, the man kept walking. A few days later I tried telling my room mates and a few other friends, and they all looked at me like I was crazy, so I kept it to my self and let it stew for a while. The reason I waited to talk to anyone else for while is because I have no physical proof that this happened. I’ve never heard of this kind phenomenon anywhere! And even crazier than that is the fact that it felt like it passed rite through my head! Who the hell is going to believe that? Believe it or not, The feeling was kind of  pleasurable. To describe the feeling would be to imagine having a tube that started from your left temple behind your eyes out your right temple, now imagine pulling a piece of mink fur through that tunnel. That&#39;s what it felt like. I would like to know if anyone else has ever experienced this kind of phenomenon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Please contact me at email ((e-address deleted)).<n> <n><n> <n><n> 831-((telephone number deleted))  or  write me @ ((address deleted)) La Selva Beach CA. 95076<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness contacted NUFORC on many occasions about this alleged incident.

11/20/05 20:30|New Rochelle|NY|Unknown|4 hours|Strange "soundless" objects and Streaking Lights over New Rochelle, NY|12/16/05|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/047/S47873.html|127|ndxe200511| Strange &#34;soundless&#34; objects and Streaking Lights over New Rochelle, NY<n> <n><n> <n><n> My friend and I were driving home when I we saw 4 lights that seemed to be in perfect alignment across the sky and very close to our location; they were at approx. 1500-3000 feet.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When we got closer the lights now formed a perfect rectangle; each light was .5 to 1.5 miles away from the other.  After &#34;hovering&#34; for about 1 minute, 2 of the lights slowly began moving out of the formation and the other two dissappeard.  These WERE NOT helicopters!  There was absolutely NO sound coming from them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We traveled down the road another mile where we parked near my home in a large open parking lot.  At this time the sky became flooded with extremly low and slow flying as well as high altitude jets which seemed unusually quiet.  All of the jets seemed to be 737&#39;s and 767&#39;s and all had identical lights that I didnt recognize as commercial.  These jets were unusually quiet, had no window lights, and had dark colored paint schemes.  I believe the jets I saw were the aircraft in the following links http://www.fas.org/man/dod-101/sys/ac/e-767.htm http://www.fas.org/man/dod-101/sys/ac/e-737.htm<n> <n><n> <n><n> After about 10 minutes of watching these low and high flying jets, the strange objects returned.  Flying at about 1500 feet and making absolutely no sound, these craft seemed to move against all aerodynamic principles slowing down almost to a stop then suddenly speeding up extremely fast and reaching very high altitudes very quickly.  They had green red and white lights which pulsed in a bizarre sequence unlike any aircraft I&#39;ve ever seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After watching one of these craft for 2-3 minutes it dissappeared. My friend and I were looking in the direction that it disappeard when I looked away for a second and he screamed out &#34; did you see that!&#34; He had seen a white ball of light streak across the sky (half the distance horizon to horizon) in the blink of an eye. 5 minutes later, one of the low flying &#34;dark&#34; jets was flying overhead when my friend and I saw one of the &#34;hovering&#34; craft with odd sequential lights about 1 mile away over a nearby golf course. I immediately looked to the &#34;dark&#34; jet that just flew overhead and it banked suddenly very hard right and accelerated towards the &#34;hovering&#34; craft we had just seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After this the skies emptied and after about 20 minutes and there were absolutely NO airplanes in the skies overhead. We stayed outside for another hour staring at the sky when I saw what my friend had seen earlier. A small egg shaped light streaked halfway across the horizon at rediculous speed. The one I saw was horizontal and the one my friend saw shot upwards diagonally. I&#39;ve seen shooting stars many times and I assure these were not. WHat really solidified my sighting for me as being at least &#34;unusual&#34; was that no more than 5 minutes after I saw the light flash, a military helicopter flew overhead at maybe 800 feet with the brightest search light on it that I&#39;ve ever seen.<n>

It then started to disappear but we watched this one more closely to see that it didnt disappear it was moving further away from earth so it got smaller eventually we couldnt see it anymore but we have no explanation for what happened so would you contact us if u have seen anyhting like we have over essex on this nite.

They were spread out over 10-15 miles. The last on had a red blinking light with a white light too. at times the 2nd, 3rd or 4th lights the would disappear and then re-appear some minutes`later, still in this straight line, headed toward the East.

There is a crane and there is a light on It (for aircraft I suppose). This light was moving.  Thought strange the crane operating at night-then I realised, the light was moving-2 white lights and one amber-the amber was in the middle. It hovered across the building site- down the road, and then across the street-it seemed so close-but after I thought surely I would see a shape of some kind-then it seemes so far away.  I stopped a guy on the street and asked him what he thought-he was just as perplexed, but less interested.  I do know this was not a plane...I don&#39;t know what it was. It was silent.<n>

It is definetley a UFO because it occured int the Southwest sky and was the brightest light I have ever seen in the sky, even brighter than mars.  It did not move at first.  When we looked back at the object after a few minutes it was gone, then it reappeared again, this time moving northeast.  AS it moved northeast it slowly moved down.  IT made the most movement in the last 15 minutes prior to it&#39;s dissappearing.  It did not seem to change color, but I have never seen a star move like that and it certainly wasn&#39;t an aircraft.  There were planes flying in the sky at the time around the origination of the object.  The object seemed very far away much like it is a star in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with this witness via telephone, and based on her description of the object, we suspect that she was looking at Venus.

The screen began flickering and turning to a blue background and the GPS location symbol indicating my vehicle location froze.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Moments later we (my wife &amp; I) noticed what we initially thought to be a &#34;shooting star&#34; falling directly in front of our driving direction what appeared to be approx. 1 mile away.  The &#34;falling star&#34; light remained as bright as the planet Jupiter as seen with our naked eyes, as it was falling in the sky adjacent to Jupiter in the southern night sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The &#34;falling star&#34; was falling at a tremendous speed as we have noticed other &#34;falling stars&#34; in the desert.  This light was traveling straight down as opposed to an angle that other &#34;falling stars&#34; we have previously noticed.  The &#34;falling star&#34; went from a high falling speed from approx. 80 degees above the horizon to an immediate stop approx. 15 degrees above the horizon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The &#34;falling star&#34; light remained stationary for approx. 1 min.  The light began to move off to the west at a slow but contant speed, similar to the speed of an aircraft and the light began to oscillate with white, red and blue lights.  Using Jupiter in the sky as a point of reference, the light turned to the west of Jupiter where it stopped.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The light then began to travel east, stopped momentarily and then traveled straight up from 15 degrees above the horizon to approx. 40 degrees above the horizon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have a MS degree from UCLA and previously earned my private pilot&#39;s license for single engine aircraft.  I have no knowledge of any aircraft able to maneuver as I witnessed.<n>

Looking up I saw i large circle and 3 smaller circles. at first thought these were skydivers from the plan I had heard. once the plane left I waited for the chutes to open. 8 minutes later a passenger jet came over at about 15 thousand feet. At that time I realized these circles were at a higher distance. So I ran to get my camera a olympic rebel.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Viewing the circles through the lens gave me a closer picture of one large circle and three small moving around the larger circle. I proceeded to take some pictures and the camera did not work! I then continued to watch and one by one the smaller circles merged with the larger circle. Once they were all merged the larger circle went straight up and disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was completely astonished as to what I saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n> That is all.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

What caught my eye was that there were no lights on it at all--you could only see the ambient light from the city reflecting on it.  It seemed a little weird, and I just shrugged it off.  About five minutes later, I saw it (or another one just like it) again, flying in the other direction, and this time called the attention of a couple of friends to it.   No one had any idea what it might be.  We watched it fly north until it disappeared into the horizon/light pollution/etc.  Waited for another 30 minutes or so, but didn&#39;t see it again.  Possibly chevron shaped, possibly oblong/spherical--it was hard to tell because there were no lights on it.<n>

It was a clear night sky with a bright moon.  I scanned the sky for several minutes as I always do, ever since my wife and I witnessed a sighting on November 18, 2001.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I spent about 5 minutes scanning the sky an then, out of the corner of my eye I noticed a formation of objects with a dim/amber/reddish &#34;glow&#34; float across the sky silently in a &#34;boomerang&#34; shaped formation.  The formation was heading North West.  Visible for aproximately 15 seconds before going out my line of sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I continued to scan the sky - there were several &#34;formations&#34; of amber glowing objects floating across the sky. One formation after the other.  Some in perfect V shaped formation, other formations of various sizes.  At one point you could go so far as to describe it as &#34;fleets&#34; of formations....  I ran inside my house to alert my wife.  It took about 30 seconds for me to get her off the computer, and run outside to the front of our house and when we looked up in the sky more formations were floating across the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Literally dozens of ambering glowing formations in several minutes.  We stayed outside for 30 more minutes but did not see any more objects in the sky, so my wife went back inside I continued to scan the skys, but also went back inside after a few more minutes of non-activity.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At 4:00 AM I had an urge to go check outside again, and within 20 seconds of viewing the night sky from my porch a giant Formation in perfect V shape formation floated beneath the moonlight sky.  I observed this for 15 seconds before the formation blended into the night sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I told my wife, and I went back outside.  In the next 15 minutes I saw 2 more formations float by.  At 4:15 AM my 21 year old son and his friend came outside to see what I was doing. I greeted them in the front yard, and told them I was scanning the sky for &#34;formations&#34;.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Our son had witnessed these objects with my wife, and I back in February of 2005. And within minutes 1 smaller formation of objects floated across the sky, as witnessed by my self, my son, and his friend. His friend was completely in awe of what he caught a glimpse of.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We scanned the sky for a few minutes before going back inside at 4:30 AM.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At 5:00AM I checked again from my balcony and observed another V Shaped/Boomerang Shaped Amber glowing formation of objects float across the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> These Formations/Boomerang Objects have been witnessed several times before since November 18, 2001.  One of the reasons I was scanning the Sky tonight was because I had a feeling the sighting my wife and I had in November of 2001 would repeat...and it looks like it did, albeit not as intense as it was on November 18, 2001 .... but still a pretty good show by whatever those boomerang/formations are...<n> <n><n> <n><n>

And then I saw the object again. My friend that was over at my house came out and looked at the object. The object was going to the west and we lost sight of the object and we didn&#39;t see it no more. This happened on November 19, 2005 on a Saturday night at 7:55 P.M. It was a cloudy night.

That was when my wife noticed strange lights in the night sky and brought it to my attention.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There were dozens, perhaps hundreds of lights that were blinking white light in different intensities. They were traveling from over Keel mountain east to west direction heading towards Huntsville.  There was no organization to these lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My wife got her telephone and called her friend to tell her what we were witnessing.  While she was talking on the phone I noticed a group of these white lights formed a large circle behind our house out in the field and stopped for several minutes and began to flash wildly.  They didn&#39;t flash all at once but randomly wild with intensity.  They must&#39;ve been two hundred feet away and about one hundred feet off the ground.  They were not equally spaced but they did form a perfect circle.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After a few minutes the lights from the circle that they created took off like a stream of bees flying.  They took off west towards Huntsville too.  I couldn&#39;t make out any shapes and didn&#39;t hear any sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There were more of these lights coming over Keel mountain when my wife pointed to a faint object overhead.  It looked like a faint burnt orangish disk that was stationary in the sky.  I went into the house and got my telescope out to see what it was.  The object was still there.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My wife is far sight and kept telling me that there was a second object overhead too but I couldn&#39;t see it.  What I could see with my telescope just made me more confused of what I was looking at.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It looked like a faint burnt orangish disk with knobs on the bottom like you see with some reflectors. The flurry of white lights finally ceased but the disk overhead was still there but faintly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Afterwards my wife and I went inside because we were getting too cold.  We were speachless as to what we witnessed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We have no idea what the multiple lights may have been, but we have written the witness, asking what direction the clouds were moving at the time of the sighting of those lights.

It was traveling southwest toward my location.  Around the border of the horse shoe were a series of large pulsating red lights.  They may have been flashing or lighting in a series, but the effect was such that the light seemed continous.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object appeared to be wobbling as if it were having difficulty maintaining its attitude.  It&#39;s stopped and remained stationary for approximately 1 minute.  I estimate the altitude at about 2,000 feet.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object then began to move backward - away from my location.   While there was no sound, the movement was such that the object appeared to have some form of propulsion - i.e., it was not floating as one might expect with a balloon.   It traveled into the distance to where I could no longer see it.  I took a picture with my cell phone, but it was too distant; therefore, nothing was visible on the picture.<n>
11/19/05 05:40|Lenoir City|TN|Diamond|1 minute|Multiple sightings in Tennessee.|12/16/05|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/047/S47844.html|148|ndxe200511| Multiple sightings in Tennessee.<n> <n><n> <n><n> First off, I am not a liar nor do I have anything to gain from this report. I know the chances of a UFO sighting is rare, and I know that multiple encounters almost never happen. But I beleive this is due to the fact that simply no one is looking up or noticing what is around them everyday. I felt compelled to seek this site out and tell my stories since my latest sighting is the third within 48 hours. But I have had several encounters with these objects over the past 10 years. I will explain below. I will start with the first of the three sightings this week:  Sighting 1 -  On 11/17/05 at approximately 18:35 while driving east on Tellico Pkwy in Lenoir City,TN I noticed two extremely bright lights hovering approximately 200-300ft. over the lake. This was a familiar site to me as I&#39;ve seen it before, so I pulled into the next boatdock that happened to be within site of the object. I watched as the object slowly creep across the lake and change direction several times before flying over the hills. I also noticed that it seemed to be purposely  staying away from the houses.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Sighting 2 - At precisely 22:50 that same evening, while sitting at a traffic light near the Wal-Mart/Home Depot plaza in Lenoir City TN at , adjacent to the highway in a field I noticed the two extremely bright lights again slowly hovering approximately 200-300ft off of the ground. The traffic light turned green but since there was only one other car on the road, I decided to sit and watch this object. I rolled down the window to hear a faint &#34;shooosh&#34; sound coming from the craft. It continued to slowly make it&#39;s way torwards me but the veered off away from me right before passing over. I turned my vehicle around and decided to try follow the slow moving craft, but in an instant, the craft quicky accelerated out of sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Sighting 3 - Earlier this morning,at precisely 5:42, I was heading east over Ft.Loudoun Dam in Lenoir City TN, when I notice the object hovering over the lake approx 300yds off the highway. Again it was very low to the surface. I pulled off to watch for approximately 1 min before the craft did a perfect 360 and headed north.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I said before, I&#39;ve had multiple sightings of what I believe is this very same type of craft. My very first sighting was approximately 10 years ago in Loudon out in the country. I&#39;m guessing the time was around 22:00 - 23:00 and noticed the craft slopwly moving across the top of the treeline. I immediately knew this wasn&#39;t your everyday airplane. I followed the best I could with what roads I could find to lead me in the same direction. This went on for about 10 minutes. I managed to get within a few hundred yards of the object, but eventually lost it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My next sighting would prove to be the best to date. It about 5 years ago. I was driving west on Hwy 72 in Monroe County leaving Vonore TN. It was approx. 23:00 - 24:00 When topping a hill I noticed a tractor trailer heading my direction violently swerve over the yellow line. I slowed to see what was up when I ten saw the craft about 400 yds in front of me hovering 100ft over the highway. I assume the truck driver was seeing what I was. Though I&#39;m not sure if he stopped as well. I watched the craft hover across the highway into the wooded area to the left of me out of sight. And then to my surprise, to my right was another craft slowly headed northeast of me. It was about the same height off of the ground. I creeped my vehicle down the highway to watch this second craft when the object stopped and changed directions. I pulled off to the side of the road and I turned off my vehicle hoping to hear a sound. I proceeded to get out. I watched the second craft for at least two minutes when all of a sudden I started to hear this &#34;shooooooshing&#34; sound coming from behind me. I looked around and saw the first craft headed directly over top of me. It was now about 200 ft over me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> These crafts appear to be approximately 30ft in dia. I can tell it&#39;s either a diamond or cross shape due to it&#39;s lighting pattern. It has two very bright lights in front with one light on each point of the craft. The rear light appears to be red or green and usually blinking. To anyone not paying special attention, the lighting configurations may look like a common domestic aircraft, but their maneuvers are quite uncommon. The only military aircraft that I know of capable of this is the Marine&#39;s Harrier or the new F/A-22. But these crafts appear to be smaller and extremely quite when compared to the two. If these are indeed military, then they have managed to keep this secret aircraft under wraps for at least a decade. If they are visitors from another world, then what better camouflage than closely mimicking our aircraft&#39;s lighting designs. Ether way , I hope to get one of these objects on film very soon. I should also mention that all of my sigthings have all been in the colder months. Not sure what significance that is,(if any) but it&#39;s defintely worth noting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> If anything, I hope this report causes more people out there to look up more often and pay closer attention. It&#39;s very easy to get into a routine and take your surroundings for granted. I would imagine there would be thousands more sightings every month if not every week if people would just look to the skies more often.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We have invited the witness to submit separate reports.

11/18/05 22:35|Browns Summit|NC|Unknown|30 Minutes|Two strange lights with planes chasing over Greensboro, NC.|12/16/05|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/047/S47789.html|149|ndxe200511| Two strange lights with planes chasing over Greensboro, NC.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I was driving home, I looked up into the sky and saw two strange bright lights.  These lights were moving very slowly, and there seemed to be a lot of planes out.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As one plane got extremely close to one of the lights, the light took straight off up and I couldn&#39;t find the plane or the other light again after this. It was very odd and it scared me a lot.<n>
11/18/05 22:30|Lincoln|CA|Sphere|15 seconds|Three Spheres moving in formation|12/16/05|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/048/S48172.html|150|ndxe200511| Three Spheres moving in formation<n> <n><n> <n><n> Friday evening as I stood on my back porch , three round glowing objects suddenly came into vision from behind the limbs of a large oak tree. I live just east of Lincoln Airport in Northern California. they were silent and moving in a perfect arrow formation. They looked to be about 700 to 1000 ft up, (airport pattern altitude), almost overhead of me but a few hundred feet west and moving very fast, apx 300 or 400 knots. They were close enough at first that I could see their sphere structure, but no lines or dots or ribbing or anything, just opaque globes. They appeared perfectly round and exactly alike. They flew like they were a single unit but I could see space between them. There were no lights or twinkles or anything like that. If I wouldnt have been gazing right up there I probably wouldnt have noticed. They were mostly white but ever so slightly orange tinted. Their coarse looked like due north and about 6 or 7 seconds into my event the formation made a slight but instantanious course change of about 5 or 6 degrees west. It appeared to be a perfectly angular turn with no perceptible curve. That really blew my mind. I watched and strained to hear a sound as the formation became so dim I could no longer see it. I never heard a sound. It was really dark, visibility was very good, the moon was rising . The whole thing was over in about 15 seconds. I know what I saw, I just dont know what it was I saw. One other thing that occurs to me,if you check out your maps you will see that at that speed and course they would very shortly be over or near Beale Airforce Base which is a pretty secure base, (SR71 / U2 types).<n> <n><n> <n><n>
11/18/05 22:00|Pittsfield (proximity of; to south; 90 E on highway)|MA|Cigar|4 seconds|Green ovular/cigar shaped ball of pure energy radiates off treetops and cuts over highway|12/16/05|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/047/S47892.html|151|ndxe200511| Green ovular/cigar shaped ball of pure energy radiates off treetops and cuts over highway.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On Friday evening, we were driving eastbound on 90 east in MASS.  We were generally in the area of the highway that is south of Pittsfield.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Though the sighting duration may seem odd (4 seconds), and leave too many questions for the average skeptic, please allow me to elaborate before you hastily draw a conclusion.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was the driver of the vehicle and had a passenger in both the front and rear of the vehicle.  A rapid movement in the corner of my eye, slightly above and to the left caught my attention.  A green ovular/cigar shaped ball of pure, very green (and unchanging) energy was there, cutting perfectly horizontal to the surface of the earth from right to left.  It was heading from south to the north as we were traveling east.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I caught the end of its horizontal manuever it suddenly, and drastically, changed directions in an impossible fashion.  It was a movement that would be be impossible for any known earth technology.  It was also something that defied the physics of a plane, comet or fireworks.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It suddenly headed downward and at an angle to the left of my position.  It suddenly vanished a hundred feet above the treetops.  The ball of pure light was described by the frontside passenger as &#34;a green lightsaber type energy.&#34;   Coincidentally, she saw it about 1 second after it caught my eye.  She screamed out, &#34;Oh my god a plane is crashing!&#34;  Then she suddenly froze up and sort of stuttered when it changed direction and blinked out of existence.  Right when it was over the trees it illuminated them slightly which was strange.  It radiated a green ambient light that matched the color of the energy.<n> <n><n> <n><n> She became very shaken and emotional.  She took out her camera in the event there was another appearance of the craft but it suddenly died entirely.  Ten minutes later, further down the road, it turned on with a 100 percent full charge.<n> <n><n> <n><n> She started talking to the passenger in the back who did not see the craft because of her position. The roof of the car blocked her line of sight.  She began getting teared up and inexplicably emotional.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We both agreed that we felt very vulnerable.  She began saying that she felt as though she was a child laying in bed.  Before she could go further with the analogy, I completed the thought by saying, &#34;...like when you feel completely unsafe and prone when there are no covers over you.&#34;   She became more shaken and said, &#34;That is EXACTLY what I was going to say!&#34;<n> <n><n> <n><n> Though we were driving from the New York area to New Hampshire, a 6-7 hour trip, it took forever.  We did get lost at one point but we couldn&#39;t take into account the FULL three to four hours that were added to our trip time (total of 10 hours or so).  We had no notice of any sort of incongruity that might come with &#34;missing time&#34;.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When we finally arrived at our destination, the other witness talked to her friend that did not see the ship in private.  The non-witness came out to the living room and told me the witness was tearing up and clearly shaken.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The other witness had no prior interest in UFO phenomenon or anything relating to the subject matter. I  myself have always been interested and I have to say that this was 100 percent unexplainable and absolutely extraordinary!<n>

My friend was with me for about 30 minutes he saw a shooting star or a possible satellite fly across the sky he sighted this for about 3 seconds two days before I saw a very similar thing the night continued and we saw nothing else.  My fried was then picked up by his parents at 19:00 on the night I went back to sky watch. I was watching for 15 minutes and recorded no events. But then at 19:23 I saw two lights fly across the sky I was in utter shock because the thing was so low in the sky it was only the height of a two story building it had not engine noise what so ever that is another thing that really startled me about it I watched for about 20 seconds as it flew past I quickly acted and ran down two stairs that leave off the patio and then I had to get up a flight of 8 stairs these are stairs because it is a house that was built on a slope so there are stairs down to the garden which is a very strange layout. I got up the stairs and got my camera ready I saw the two lights as it past out of sight behind a tree. There is a massive double gate at the top of the stairs and it is chained it is chained because we have recently been getting burglars attempting to get into the garage and steal like they are known to do I pulled endlessly on the chain but it was no use it just would not come on I am not sure if this is due to the cold temperature and the chain was stuck on by ice or frost or something along those lines but it would not come off. I ran down the stairs and round to the other set of stairs which is at the other side of the garden and is a very long way away I got up those stairs but when I got up the stairs there was nothing at all to be seen. But I am 100% sure this is a UFO it could not be identified I just do not know what the hell it could be.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Military Fighter  This is one thing that is really odd about the Sighting I think the government could be chasing this thing as before the sighting I saw a military jet go over which is unusual for that time of night I heard the roar that fighters make and it flew overhead leaving a trail that fighters commonly made it had all red lights flashing and all the other lights were on and it went off into the distant in a Southerly direction then a few minutes later was when I saw the UFO go toward the East then about 2 minutes after the sighting the fighter (possibly the same one) came back and went off to the East it think it was the same because it had all the same lights on it. So I think the government could have possibly been chasing this thing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Student report.  PD))<n>

It was bright white, with no blinking lights at all.  I assumed it was a satellite or possibly the International Space Station, as any airplane flying that low would surely have visible blinking lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Two friends and I (all of whom are, in fact, college students) saw the light move east across the sky in a straight path.  It was somewhat faster than an airplane, but still slow enough for us to stand and watch it move for a good minute or so.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then the object came to a complete stop in the sky, just above Mars.  We continued watching it further, and the object grew considerably fainter.  Then, it began to slowly fly in irregular circles for about ten minutes or so before finally fading away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> All three of us saw it move across the sky, stop, and begin circling, and all of us agreed on the direction it was moving.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  The ISS pass over Wilmington at 18:11-18:15 hrs. on this date.

I thought it was firework but when two light came back look like entering earth and doesnt even look like shoot from the ground it and it defintely came from the sky. My mom agrees its not any kind of an aircrafts no big airplane can fly together like that or at great speed. My mom doesnt know for sure it was orangeish alike but she saw some of not really white almost like very light brownish like haze, but  something is very unsual  when four lights dont even move at all at whole minute while the other fly around and come back to them and then she agree with me that it is UFO…<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

My friend also took notice of them, so I know I am not seeing things in my declining years PD!<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then we observed a third object just appear, it was very weird to see two, look away for a split second, look back up and then have there be three objects!  This was in broad day light, no clouds, nothing, come on, it’s Arizona! Big blue, clear skies.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is not the first time I have witnessed strange objects in the Arizona sky.  Specifically the Central (Metro Phoenix) area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So, we just continued to walk back to my place and eventually lost interest.  They were silver and shinny.  Too high to really detail the precise design or any specific shapes however, I do not think they were balloons as they were not moving or being blown in any specific direct rather, just hanging out, enjoying the view of downtown Scottsdale!   I&#39;d say the altitude was between 1000 - 2000 ft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thanks, PD!<n>

After about 30 minutes the light would dissapear and reapear in the sky a few seconds later in a distance that would have been impossible for the object to get to in that amount of time. these lights continued to appear on a nightly basis for about a week and still appear sometimes. i thought the lights were helicopters but i went outside and could not hear anything. the lights have always stayed in the same general area, which seems to be about 3 miles south of my home. i have been searching for the light s since then and i have only spotted them a few times, but i still search the sky for them when ever i get the chance.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

Anyone else?|12/16/05|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/047/S47781.html|163|ndxe200511| 300 hundred above me an arrowhead oblonged cone shape object  flew slow above me.  Anyone else?<n> <n><n> <n><n> Arrowhead shaped object on all axis. Color of object is hard to determine because the moon was bright that night and the object gave off almost no reflextion.  So I assume it might be black.  No running lights, no real wing span, no noise other than a high pitch wind type noise.  The object seemed only about 300 feet above me.  Only going about 30 to 40 mph.  Way, way too slow for any type of aircraft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It stopped for a moment to allow a medic helicopter to go by then resumed its flight.  It was heading south along the Wasatch Mountains, keeping close to the mountains as if using them for cover.  I figure the object was about 60 feet in length and about 20 feet in width and the depth or height I cannot determine, the sucker flew right above me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was a funny thing I just happened to look up because the moon was so bright that night then I saw this object moving.  Hardly any sound and it was not a hot air ballon because first any ballonist would be crazy to fly that close to the mountain range at night and I could see no basket underneath.<n> <n><n> <n><n> And as it flew directly above me I swear my hairs stood up as if there was a strong static charge in the air, like when you brush a balloon on your head to stick it to the wall.  This thing was diffently not like any aircraft I have seen.  Best discription would be an oblonged cone shape.  No elevators, no vertical stablizer was seen.  No visiable landing gear or hatches.  This thing was very smooth at least at the distance I viewed at.  My dog went nuts and I could hear other dogs go nuts.  Like when an ambulance goes by in your nieghborhood.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I would love to hear from anyone else who has possibly seen this object.  I do not have any photos of this object, but you can bet the next time I will be ready.<n>

They appeared to be in a line formation from our angle.  They appeared to be stationary or hover at a high altitude.  I think we were watching for 5 minutes maybe even a little longer before I thought to note the mile marker that we just passed, 82.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At 8:45 they began to disappear one by one by diminishing, turning red before completely disappearing. (They appeared to move as they disappear. )  I think they were all gone by mile marker 88.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After the main event there were tiny sparkles of light bursts occurred in the sky darting everywhere.  It was between Sentinel/Hyder and Agua Caliente.   They were plenty of cars stopped at the rest area we passed on the same side of the freeway.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We did not have a camcorder or camera to document but perhaps someone did as many vehicles were stopped at the rest area as well as one on the side of the road.  Maybe others will report too due to the proximity to the rest area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is the first time I have observed something like this.  The location is about 70 or 80 miles from Yuma and about 100 from Phoenix.  There is a air base in Yuma.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I did an internet search and learned of the Phoenix lights.  They looked similar.<n>

It appeared to be approximately 1/3 the size of the moon that was in the south east sky, the object was in the south west sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Also, there were several lights that appeared to extend from the objects like light beams and the object slowly changed from a white blue to a white orange bright light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am certain that this was a UFO.<n>

At first I thought it was a plane because I can see flights coming or going from the airport from here everyday in the distance.  I&#39;ll try to describe best I can.<n> <n><n> <n><n> You know how planes have a light at the end of the each wing... it looked like that ...  one on each end, both red, solid, not blinking.  It came from my west point of view....(yes, towards the airport kind of.)  But the strange thing for me is that their was nothing between the lights?  It flew directly above me at about 1500ft no higher than 2000ft at the most heading to Matthews, NC, my Northeast.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I could see in between the two red dots to see stars when it moved across the sky where if it was say a plane you&#39;d see the two red dots then if it crossed a path of the star it would obstruct the few of the star for a second but it didn&#39;t.  I couldn&#39;t hear any engines and it moved somewhat across the sky like a plane would but I had a GOOD look at for at least 30 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Nothing I&#39;ve ever seen before and I&#39;m always looking at the stars when walking my dog at night.  I was just hoping someone else might have seen this also.  I&#39;m not easily floored but it was a weird experience.  Any suggestions?<n>

The small one that almost it hit was now following it and then I saw another one. I got close enough to see some kind of shape on it Like it was trying to be invisable but you could see part of the outline.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I did see the same 3 things this last summer when I was coming home from Monahans a town that si only 20 miles away but I didn&#39;t think anything about it until today.

I had been spotting bizarre lights in this area for months, and knew she was looking to the West.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Sure enough, this extremely bright ball of light was sitting in the sky.  It looked to be just above the hills between where we live and the town next to us, Copperopolis.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I truly wanted to dismiss this thing as a star, but it was simply too bright.  I have never seen stars that bright.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I went back inside, grabbed my Sony video camcorder and taped this object for maybe 5 minutes.  It didn&#39;t do much at all, just hovering. I grew tired of it and went back inside.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I came back minutes later to retrieve firewood and the object has vanished.  Looking at the tape later, I had zoomed in on the object and noted that it appeared to have a perfect round shape to it, except the 1/4 bottom half wasn&#39;t lit as much as the rest of the ball.  And there appeared to be a smaller object just above it.  Whether or not this 2nd object was a star,  I am not sure.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There certainly seems to be a lot of UFO activity here in the Angels Camp and Sonora area.<n>

I saw lights coming from the East and heading towards me (West).  I thought it was a plane at first.  It was off the normal pattern.  Only thing I&#39;ve seen here coming from the East are choppers coming into the hospital here.  It had at least two bright strobe lights on each corner.  It also reminded me of a plane coming in for a landing.  How the lights blend together and as it gets closer they are separate.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When it got within about 300 feet of my position it turned to the North.  And that&#39;s when I noticed it was triangular shaped, with round lights on all three corners and one in the center of the belly.  One red flashing strobe underneath about center.  Along with the strange shape it made NO SOUND whatsoever.  It was as low as the fighters I saw about a month ago.  It took about 5 minutes before it was totally out of sight and it didn&#39;t seem to be in a hurry. Total observation time was about 7 minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The following link gives a simular picture of the Black Triangular Aircraft.

No noises at all.<n> <n><n> <n><n> AT dusk, approximately 5:50 PM, I was in the front yard, letting my dog snoop.  I was therefore wasting time, As I happened to look up, I saw what I originally thought were three helicopters approaching from the west.  I kept waiting for them to get closer and bigger, but even though they finally flew over, they never got bigger, I never hard any sounds, and they were MUCH higher than jetliners flying over either, into or out of the airport.  And even as they leave the airport, they are much higher than a helicopter. When an actual helicopter did actually fly over, then is when I realized these three items were WAY too high to be helicopters, as I had originaly wondered about.  One item, the front one, looked as if maybe it was a large rectangle item, and did turn 90 degrees a number of times.  Their fomation stayed consitent.  In the past, others have reported the &#34;sighting&#34; over Phoenix at night, and the lights.  This time, there were no lights, but the sun had not yet gone down.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am a man, aged 64, sane, and have never before believed I&#39;ve ever witnessed UFO&#39;s.  This sighting was way too weird, and I can be certain they were not normal aircraft.  Even very high aircraft, you hear some noise, not this time, and no vapor trails.  Movement across the sky was steady, and rather slow.<n>

The hair on the back of my neck stood up and I could feel like an adrenaline rush shoot through me cold when suddenly, after it was stationed for 3 minutes, shot to the left, still in sight, and then right back to its original position.  It stayed in position there for another few seconds before shooting to the left again and back before it shot off towards the right, but back behind it.  It seemed to pulse more clearly and boldly once I fixed my eyes on it, like it knew I was watching.  Just thinking about it makes my hair stand up again!<n>

Not till i saw one myself, along with my grandparents, aunt, and cousin, which im glad because none of them would beleive me if i told them &#34; I JUST SAW A UFO!&#34; Anyways...<n> <n><n> <n><n> The Sighting occured 2 years ago, i just now was interested in reporting it, it lasted about 45 sec. just outside of Parsons, KS. It was just a bright red light that caught the corner of my eye.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As i looked over, it appeared to &#34;open up&#34; with the first light i saw stopping, then, simultaneously two lights on each side of the single light lit up, then two more lights on the sides of those lit up at the same time, with two more to light on the side of them.  There were seven total lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then, without moving it appeared to close up the same as it had opened, with the two outside lights going off simultaneously then the next, then the next. with only the middle light visible it appeared to move to a different area in the sky. Then it opened and closed the same way. It did this maybe 4 times.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then, almost suddenly it shot off, open, with an incredible speed. I could not beleive what i saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have you know that this experience sparked my intrest for ufology and astronomy, i hope to serve in those fields. I want to know all i can.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Please take this seriously, i have no reason to lie. I am a christian, if that means nothing to you, you should know they are honest.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

It was at a distance, so I figured the triangular shape was just the nose and wing lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I parked the car and got out it was flying almost directly overhead and I could hear no sound.  I looked for the blinking tail light, then realized it had a light in the front and one where each wing would be, plus a light inbetween them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There&#39;s nothing &#39;in between&#39; on a plane.  There was no tail light, only another two or three light between what I thought was the wing lights.  It was a perfect triangle.  I tried to follow it through the overhead trees, but lost it.<n>

It looked like it was going to crash into a few thousand homes,  and just like that- it vanished.  It left a bright yellow [duo] trail of firey yellow-white, that also vanished quickly shortly afterwards.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was driving down hiway 880 N bound to take my son home to Hayward,and on the way I saw a lime green sphere with a fiery [duo] trail trailing behind it.

It was very cloudy, but clouds were moving fast.  In the clouds, I observed (corner of right eye) five moving orbs of light in the cloudy part of the sky.  I was driving.  I stopped twice to figure out where they were coming from.  The patterns shifted from circluar to meet in the middle and zoom back out again.  After I got to my destination, I watched for five more minutes.  In this time, the oval lights stopped for a few seconds and started back in an odd pattern.  First they circled again, meeting in the middle and then three of the oval lights dissapeared.  One of the two left became a blue light instead of white.  They formed a chasing pattern throughout the edge of the clouds, zooming wildly back and forth but never leaving the clouds.  Eventually, they just stopped.  I watch the skies repeatedly and I know where the beacons are in my hometown.  These were no beacons, or stars, or planes.  Totally odd.<n>

I would guess it was a high flying object by the size of it, but I could be wrong.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am an amature astronomer so I know what planes look like, flashing red and green lights but this object&#39;s lights are totally white.  I also have Microsoft Flight Simulator 2004 and I&#39;ve downloaded every plane possible and each and every one of them have red and green lights tjhat flash.

Our location at the time was in east Layton, UT and the fireball appeared due north of us, or (given the visibility that night) approximately due east of Ogden, UT, and appeared as if it were directly over the mountains.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The fireball traveled quickly, was very bright (considering there was a full moon out, the object was very brilliant) and its line of travel was approximately NNW.  It traveled about the same speed as other meteors I have seen (i.e., quite fast) although the direction (a bit west of north) was unusual.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Less than a minute later, planes (distinguishable by their navigation lights) could be seen making their routine turns in their approach to land in Salt Lake and elsewhere, but this was no airplane.

All of a sudden I saw a fireball in the sky It appear going the same direction I was going and I thought a meteorite but as soon as I finishe my thought it stopped...I started to scream on the phone to my mom I have to stop (several times), I stopped and it went down to the left it disappear from my sight (there were trees)for a a second or two. I was static... and I saw it again coming up to the same point in the sky where it had stopped. It was big I put my fist against the fireball shape and I still could see the edges of it; It started moving to the right in a downward direction...same thing happened it disappear from my sight (there were trees) for a a second or two. This time it appeared moving horizontally from right to left and that was it I did not see it again. I waited about 20 minutes just in case but I had to leave and pick up my son (needles to say I was late picking him up). I must have put the Mobile phone down because when I pick it up from the passenger seat my mom was so worried she thought I was in some kind of danger. She said I was saying &#34; oh my god! oh my god!... what the heck is that?...it is here again...where is it going? what is it doing? why is my body tingling (like electricity) I felt like that for a couple of hours (It must have been my adrenaline). I could not appreciate how far it was from my position because it was dark...I think probably a mile or 2.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I asked my friend to take a look at the them, since I was driving, and tell me what they were.   He told me they were moving.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They first appeared to me  like lights at the end of a runway or something.  I was curious if there was an airport nearby.   But my photographer said they were rotating.  I began looking at them and they stayed in a line for a while...maybe 30 minutes.  But then they began dipping up and down and disappeared behind a mountain.  Suddenly a flash happened... and 4   lights spread out from this flash.  This same routine would happen...they would disappear...then a flash...then 3 or 4 more lights in a row.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At the same time...we noticed other blinking lights above us...one was leaving a trail...while other lights flashed about.  Then...they would all disappear.  They appeared to be blue and red.  This happened about 5 times.<n> <n><n> <n><n> But the big orange lights...seemed to stay a bit ahead of us and to the south of I-10 for 100 miles or so....<n> <n><n> <n><n> We finally pulled off the freeway and got our video camera out....and captured some pictures I will not see until tomorrow.    We missed the best part of this light spectacle on camera....but we do have lights appearing and disappearing......<n>

11/15/05 16:00|Camarillo|CA|Disk|8 minutes|Lewis Rd./ Camarillo FLYING SAUCER UFO seen in daylight during November, 2005|3/11/06|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/049/S49196.html|200|ndxe200511| Lewis Rd./ Camarillo FLYING SAUCER UFO seen in daylight during November, 2005<n> <n><n> <n><n> I live in Camarillo off of Lewis Rd. a few blocks from Ventura Blvd.  The nearest cross-street is Adolfo Rd and Lewis Rd.  It was sometime in November or December of 2005 in the afternoon around 4:30 pm. I was using the internet inside the house when I heard my two dogs outside errupt in a frensy of barking that seemed particularly alarming.  I tried to ignore it for a while, but it only got worse and I was alarmed too.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I went outside to see what on earth was going on and I found my grandmother sitting in the garden.  She told me excitedly that she had been yelling for me for a while to come and see a strange craft in the sky though I had not heard her.  She had been watching it approach the house from the direction of Ventura Blvd towards Adolfo Rd., hovering, then flying in a path paralel to Lewis Rd.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The dogs were disturbed, barking like crazy looking upward at the sky over our backyard fence.  I looked up and saw a light grey to silverish, reflective, solid disk hovering silently past the house rather slowly and indecisively and then picking up speed.  Amazingly, it had the solid metalic bulk of a normal aircraft but with a saucer-disk shape and  could slowly hover and &#34;float&#34; silently and weightlessly like a baloon and then pick up speed and follow a straight path.  It had a reflective, very shiny exterior.  I could see it very clearly and was amazed.  It was like no aircraft I have ever known to exist in fact.  It looked like your &#34;typical 1950&#39;s&#34; flying saucer.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My grandmother said that she had been watching it approach for some minutes and that it had been very low over the house and had ascended a bit by the time I saw it.  It was oddly silent and left no trail.  I was surprised that my dogs were so disturbed by it since they don&#39;t react at all when noisy helicopters and planes fly over the house often and at times quite low since there is an airport and a military base nearby.  They seemed to be able to distinguish the unique and alarming nature of the craft as well as we two humans could.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I want to stress that we had a perfect view of the UFO as it was directly over the house and we both clearly saw it.  As I watched it, it finally picked up speed, ascended and disapeared and reapeared in the atmosphere until about a block away it vanished.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In the past, when I have seen footage of UFO&#39;s, I have believed that they were pathetic ploys for attention and the result of special camera effects.  I now know that this is not always the case.  What I saw confirmed the t.v. footage I have so long been skeptical of, expcept, in person the sighting is clearer and more dimensional and tangible and &#34;truthful&#34; than a camcorder can convey.  Sometimes the t.v. footage looks blured.  What we witnessed was a solid clear craft.  The truth of its shape was tangible though extraordinary.  I wondered in amazement that a flying saucer could silently and boldly skoot though the skies of a quiet suberban neighborhood in such a clandestine way.  I had to see it to believe it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My friends say they have seen strange glowing UFO&#39;s in the dark early morning skies before work that are &#34;star-like&#34; but absolutely not stars.  They note that there are many sightings around military bases and think that these are secret government projects kept from the public.  It makes me wonder.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I had steped out back for a cigarett in our break area. I was the only one outside, at the time. I looked up in the sky due to the 3 bright lights catching my eye.The 3 light&#39;s were in a triangle shape, at least, 3 football field&#39;s  in length.What ever it was it was moving very slow at a low altitude. What really freaked me out, is that there was a hugh disipation of vapor coming out from the thing. However this lasted only a few second&#39;s. This was not an airplane or any type of helecoptor.I believe the ship was cloaked as i could not see the actual ship. I believe cloaking is possible, starting with Project Rainbow, back in 1941.The next thing i noticed was a strange round multicolor light in front of the craft.The light expanded as fireworks explod and the craft was gone.People think i am crazy, however i know what i saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

We departed Greenville @ 7:20a.m., about twenty minutes out of Greenville I came upon two very bright lights right in the middle of the highway. I noticed that I was 3 Hydro poles away from the lights(thinking that it was a broken down logging truck, due to the round bright lights), when I approached closer(about 1 1/2 poles away) I saw a very strange creature pacing back and forth. The creature stopped after pacing between the lights twice, looked in our direction and disappeared, and I mean it really vanished as if it went invisible. 2 other students, plus a teacher on-board my bus also saw the creature. Large egg-shaped head and a long skinny body, with arms that reached the knees.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was too high to be a streetlight, but I thought that it could possibly be an indicator fr airplanes.  Regardless, I was transfixed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I drove closer, expecting to find the pole to which it was attached, it seemed to drop in the sky.  I assumed this was just spacial relation due to my coming nearer, but it dropped vertically in the sky and gradually moved across Michigan Avenue as I was driving straight ahead.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Driving under it, I simply could not take my eyes of it. If it had been a plane, it was flying unusually low, and had a very strange shape.  Given that I&#39;ve seen many planes flying at night, and the constancy of this objects light (as opposed to the strobe action of planes), this was not a plane.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So enthralled by the hovering craft, that just seemed to linger over the building opposite the side it just crossed, I pulled off to the shoulder and tried not to let it leave my sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In the time between me taking my seatbelt off and clamboring to the passenger window, it was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> One of the strange things I noticed about this was my inability to identify just how close it was.  As I got closer to its location above me, I could differentiate it from a mass of really bright light, into a grouping of lights that centered a greenish/blue light.  I thought that it could be some remote control objectt because I was stumped as to how close it was, and what it was doing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There is no possible way that could have a plane.  The brightness of the light, the motion, and my inability to identify anything at all common about that object tell me one thing - I witnessed something incredibly out of the ordinary.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

11/15/05 02:30|Martinez|CA|Other|2 minutes|Glowing object moves across San Francisco Bay Area sky|12/16/05|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/047/S47890.html|209|ndxe200511| Glowing object moves across San Francisco Bay Area sky<n> <n><n> <n><n> At 2:30 a.m. on November 15, 2005, in Martinez (27 miles from San Francisco), my dog awakened me to take her outside to go to the bathroom. Since I had taken her out at 11:30 p.m., before I went to bed, I thought it quite unusual, but took her anyway. I was outside with enough time to sit down on my front steps when a movement in the southwest sky made me look up.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I will do my best to describe what I saw. If I had to compare the object I saw in the sky to something I have seen in my life, I would have to say it had a rectangular shape and moved somewhat in an undulating way, like a jellyfish. The outline and brightness of the thing against the dark sky was very crisp and clear. It was bright, glowing white. It had a white oval disk, which I’ll now call a head. The head seemed to lead what I’ll now call a tail. The tail was the same width as the head. The oval head was solid white and distinguishable from the tail because the tail was transparent but streaked with white light. When I say transparent, I mean I could see the dark sky behind the tail part but I could not see the dark sky behind the white oval. The tail moved in graceful, undulating like way. The object never stopped moving. It seemed to me it had a destination. At times it seemed to almost dip as it moved across t he sky, which made it seem fluid.  It made no noise.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My thoughts at the time: What is THAT? It’s so much bigger than a star or plane. It’s so defined and crisp, it looks like a cartoon or a fluorescent light. The light is coming from within it. It’s graceful. It flows. It’ll be gone before I can get a camera. I’ve never seen anything like this before. I didn’t feel threatened but I was a little scared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I first sighted it, it appeared to be moving at me, coming from southwest direction but then began moving west. As it did so, the tail seemed to undulate, almost as if it were blowing in the wind, like you might see flag or a scarf do in a light breeze. However, there was no wind that night. The leaves were not blowing in the trees.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At some point after it began moving west, my dog noticed it. She had just finished relieving herself when it must’ve caught her attention. At 2:30 am there were no other people or animals around to distract her. My dog, a beagle, has never barked at anything in the sky before, but she looked up and began a frantic, sharp bark. She has a bay type bark but when she noticed the thing in the sky, her bark was frantic and sharp. As I recall, my dog was looking up in the direction of the thing in the sky but her head was moving as if she couldn’t quite focus. I was really surprised that she was barking at something in the sky and was having a hard time myself because I couldn’t understand what it was I was looking at.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I’m a nearly 50-year-old professional and have never seen anything like that in my life. As it was 2:30 in the morning and my dog was barking frantically and I have neighbors, so I had to pull her inside. The object in the sky was moving in a northwestly direction in an undulating way when I last saw it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We have spoken with this witness on several occasions, and she seems quite reliable to us.

Light Pair exhibiting impossible aerial behaviour, &amp; not fitting air traffic profile.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This occurence was several months ago, but only recently did I become aware of a place where it could be &#39;reported&#39;.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The UFO&#39;s came to my attention as I stepped outside my front door for some fresh air, out on the eastern sky I noticed two single orange lights, and my first thought was plane. DFW airport isn&#39;t more than a half hour away so air traffic passes through quite frequently, but as I examined the two lights their behaviour and the lights themselves on each of the sources became odd to me. I quickly dismissed the profile of plane as for many reasons. The objects lacked the blinking red tail or wing lights, their behaviour as well seemed more like a helicoptor as they kept no straight path and would change direction quite erraticly. My mind finally assumed them to be UFO&#39;s as their speed was somewhat impossible for a helicoptor to match, they weren&#39;t jets by any means but how quickly and easily they flew through the air and changed direction almost on the fly kept me questioning. It was impossible for them to be planes, and if they were helicoptors then the only way the dominant lights could move so fast was if they were infact closer to me than I&#39;d assumed. Of course had they been closer I would of been able to hear the engines. The perceived altitude, the fact that only one light could be determined, the behaviour, they just couldn&#39;t be defined as anything man made that I had knowledge of. Wishful thinking has me hoping that they&#39;re the latest technology we&#39;re not being told about. Like the Blackbird and the wave of stealth fighter development that had people pondering years ago.<n> <n><n> <n><n> For anywhere from five to ten minutes I stood on my porch scratching my head as I watched these two lights. They appeared to be a pair, as well, as they stayed within close proximity to each other, they kept their maneuvers in a small patch of sky for most of the time that I witnessed them. As I was about to head inside to get a second opinion on what I was looking at, the two lights parted ways as one went farther out of sight and dropped below the horizon, and the other shot at a remarkable speed off to the north and out of sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> For a person who lives near an airport, and sees planes and helicoptors on a daily basis, I found for the first time something in the air that had me vexed. So I suppose this makes them UFO&#39;s, aliens I doubt however.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD))<n>

I can&#39;t describe how bone chilling cold it was.  In the cow pasture behind the house I could see several &#34;tents&#34; with an ominous orange glow.  They were ships on the ground I later found out. I watched for several hours and could say I know for a fact there are several types of beings.  Tall ones, upwards of 8ft. Short ones, with larger heads and a mouth from ear to ear.Blue ones and orange ones.  One seemed very friendly as we interacted telepathicly.  The greys however did not like me watching them dig, or collect water or whatever they were doing out there.  I could fell them all around me. I tried to watch several different groups &#34;beem up&#34; to the mother ship above with some type os pure beautiful light that would flash in an instant, and these groups of aliens would be gone. Further investigation in the day time reveal weeds with accelerated growth, strange trails all over the field, that had no livestock in it at the time.  I even smelled some of these weeds and depressions in the ground, what seemed to me to smell earthy, like a worm almost.<n>

I&#39;d say we are about 3-4 stories high.  Now that the leaves have fallen we can see the city pretty easily through he tree branches.  Since it was a clear night out and we were cooking dinner I was in my kitchen and looking out at the sky line and sky - we eat late.  I could see the typical air-traffic approaching Logan as well as the high altitude military and international flights that go over Boston daily.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Immediately my attention was drawn to a VERY bright  white light, slight reddish hued edges at first, that seemed like an approaching airliner but it didn&#39;t move, or so I thought.  It was very twinkly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Wondering if it was a star or a planet I continued to look at it until I noticed, thanks to the position of the tree branches, that the light was indeed moving but very slowly (there was little to no wind outside).<n> <n><n> <n><n> I called out to another person in the kitchen to come to the window and have a look.  He saw it immediately (you&#39;d have to be legally blind to miss it) and he was at a loss as to what it could be since he saw that it was indeed moving but more so like hovering.<n> <n><n> <n><n> He went to see to dinner and I kept watching.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Suddenly it got brighter and I could see on both the left, right, and the bottom edge, the light became more oblong, that there were two red lights that could be seen partially through the bright white in the center.  The other person heard me yell out and came to see it too.  Just as suddenly as it brightened it started to dim.  The white light part turned all red and just faded out til it was gone -  like CRT TV&#39;s that have the center dot that fades out.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The whole time typical aircraft were flying above and near(ish) the object.  It was much larger and brighter than any of them regardless of altitude.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thinking it was a star, I thought I would try and see if it was there the next night.  Venus and Mars have been pretty big in the sky over the last months so I thought I&#39;d wait until I could rule it out.  Of course it was cloudy the next two nights but the third night was crystal clear (11/17/05).  Not one star would have even come close as to rule it one in the same.  Not that you can see a ton in the city anyway.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There were none in the area where this seem to be in the sky.  As a point of reference, the Prudential Tower was directly below it&#39;s position.  From my point of view I&#39;d guess the light was 40 degrees altitude/10 degrees azimuth.<n>

Kind of scary.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Could be a meteorite, but it was big and such a big object falling to the ground would have made quite a bang, which I lividly kind of expected when I saw it coming down.  Was not a shooting star. Too slow, too close, could see its spherical shape because of moonlight and green flames that outlined contour.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

11/14/05 17:30|Wappingers Falls|NY|Circle|1 hour|Circular object with pulsing light seen over Stewart Air National Gaurd base in Newburgh New York.  ((NUFORC Note:  Venus sighting.))|12/16/05|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/047/S47704.html|230|ndxe200511| Circular object with pulsing light seen over Stewart Air National Gaurd base in Newburgh New York<n> <n><n> <n><n> At approximately 17:30 my wife and I spoted a very bright object in the sky on our way home from work. At first I thought of discounting it as just a bright planet in the sky, but the brightness of the object was much brighter than any planet could have been. The object was so bright that it gave of a white aura; perhaps haze in the atmosphere. We were in the car when we spotted it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object appeared to be located over a nearby national gaurd base -- Stewart Air National Gaurd base in Newburgh, New York. It was in the south western sky about 30 degrees above the horizon line.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As soon as we got out of the car we rushed to see the object. At this point we could verify it was a UFO. It was seemingly stationary like a planet or star would be, but when standing still and comparing it to a stationary object (tree -- there was no wind) it verifiably moved ever so slightly. We got a telescope and further verified the object. We could also verify its movement -- not that of a normal star, plane helicopter or balloon. It moved left to right and differed in distance at times.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object was circular with three quadrents. It appeared to morph in shape as we looked at it. The object was white through the telescope and had a dark center to it at times, sort of like a donut. The three quadrents pulsed with different color lights to the naked eye and through the telescope. The three quadrents gave it a trianular shape to the naked eye, but in the telescope the object appeared spherical. The object also had a forcefield like quality to it. the white light would shimmer and shift like plasma or some form of energetic matter.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At one point there were other lights, which some of us thought were planes circling around the object. At another point a verifiable plane flew directly in front of the object -- keep in mind this was in close proximity, if not over an air base.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object was in the sky for about an hour from the initial time we spotted it. Then after being in aproximately the same proximity for about an hour, flew off out of telescopic and naked eye range.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Venus sighting??

My work partner witnessed the same object from a different vehicle behind me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;m trying to make sense of all this...and really don&#39;t know what to think right now?<n>

I approached the object as I was driving in my car again and could see it quite some distance away behind the nearby trees.  I drove past the trees into the clearing where I could get a good view of the object.  When the object came into clear view I started to wonder if what I was looking at could possibly be a planet, because it was much too large to be a star.  No sooner did I have this thought in my mind when the object quickly faded out (as if someone had quickly turned off a dimmer switch) There were no clouds nearby in the sky that could have hidden this light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The sighting only lasted for about 10 to 15 seconds this time, but what really bothered me about this particular sighting is that I had the feeling that this object knew that I was looking at it.In my last report I suggested this light could possibly be a helicopter. I firmly believe at this time, that the light/object is not a helicopter. I don&#39;t know what the light is, but for some reason it seems to be hovering around this one particular spot in the country...as far as I can tell, there seems to be nothing but farms and fields in this area.I&#39;m reporting this sighting in case someone else in this area or other areas may have seen what I have seen. I&#39;m not sure what it is, but it just doesn&#39;t look like anything that I&#39;ve seen in the sky before and it certainly doesn&#39;t act like any sort of familiar aircraft.<n>

Felt honoured to see it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Went to my doorestep to smoke a cig.  Completely clear night.  Stars visible, but one was moving so I watched it.  Should have gone in 30 minutes ago, but kept watching.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As it grew closer it suddenly became frozen and stayed in one position.  It was at a very high altitude.  I was tempted to rush in and get my camera, but scared I&#39;d miss something.  I know that&#39;s a classic excuse, but you&#39;ll have to take my word for it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I watched it suddenly vanished, but appeared again at the far right of my eyeline as I was seeing it.  I focused ALL my attention on it.  There were occaisonal flickers of runway-like lights heading outwards in the cliche-like chevron pattern.  I swear on my parents&#39; my sister&#39;s and my own life that I watched this craft for 20 or so minutes tonight in a stationary position.  It gradually began to move, but REALLY slowly.  It would then dart at speed to another position, but it would sit there for ages.  As I say it was REALLY high.  Above cloud level.  I watched it until it was out of eyeshot.  It seemed to ascend. Clearly getting higher in a weird way, but not appearing duller.  Lights totally clear all through the incident.  Then it was suddenly gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This didn&#39;t scare me at all.  Just excited me to be honest.  Third time I&#39;ve been treated to a UFO display of such beauty!  Guess I&#39;m lucky there.  Just wish I&#39;d caught something on film!<n>

MY 10 YEAR OLD DAUGHTER WAS ALL WRAPPED UP IN A BLANKET LAYING DOWN ON THE SEAT OF THE VAN. I SAID... LOOK AT THIS BRIGHT LIGHT, WHAT THE HECK IS IT? IS IT A METEOR? I WAS FASCINATED WITH THE BRIGHTNESS OF IT.THE NIGHT WAS SO DARK OUT, THE CLOUDS WERE THICK AND FAIRLY LOW. THERE WERE NO STARS TO BE SEEN. I COULD SEE A SHADOW OF THE MOON FROM TIME TO TIME AND THEN IT WOULD BE DARK. AS WE CAME ONTO THE I-5 SOUTH THERE ARE A FEW HILLS AND I WAS DRIVING RATHER FAST TRYING TO GET AROUND THEM SO I COULD SEE THIS LIGHT AGAIN. IT WAS MUCH BRIGHTER THAN ANY LIGHT I CAN REMEMBER SEEING. I HURRIED AROUND ONE HILL AND THERE WAS A LITTLE SPACE IN BETWEEN WHERE I COULD STILL SEE THE LIGHT BEFORE WE CAME ONTO THE OTHER HILL THAT HAD BLOCKED OUR VISION. I HURRIED AROUND THAT HILL AND HERE WE COULD SEE THE LIGHT REAL CLEAR. I KEPT SAYING... WHAT COULD IT BE! MY DAUGHTER SAT UP IN HER SEAT WATCHING IT WITH ME. I SAID... IS IT AN AIRPLANE? I THOUGHT AND SAID IT CAN&#39;T BE...IT&#39;S TOO BRIGHT. THE LIGHT WAS NOT ROUND IT WAS MORE OF AN OVAL SHAPE FROM WHAT I COULD SEE. I WAS SWERVING ALL OVER THE FREEWAY. IT WAS ALMOST AS IF THIS LIGHT THAT FIRST LOOKED LIKE A METEOR OUT IN THE SKY, WAS COMING TO US AS WE WERE DRIVING. NEXT I LOOKED OVER AND IT WAS JUST HOVERING OVER IN ONE SPOT, KIND OF LIKE A HELICOPTER. MY DAUGHTER WATCHED IT AND GOT A MUCH BETTER LOOK AT IT. I ASKED HER IS IT A HELICOPTER? BEFORE I COULD EVEN FINISH THE SENTENCE I SAID... THERE IS NO WAY IT COULD BE A HELICOPTER BECAUSE THE LIGHT WAS BRIGHTER THAN ANY I&#39;VE SEEN AND IT WAS WAY TO BIG. ALL OF THE SUDDEN IT STARTED DROPPING STRAIGHT DOWN. FROM WHERE IT WAS HOVERING OVER, NOT MOVING, TO STRAIGHT DOWN. I SAID.. IS THAT THING DROPPING DOWN OR IS IT JUST MY EYES CAUSE I&#39;M DRIVING? I TOLD MY DAUGHTER I WAS GOING TO PULL OVER ON THE SIDE OF THE FREEWAY SO I COULD GET A GOOD LOOK AND SHE SAID... THAT IS TO BIG DON&#39;T PULL OVER...KEEP ON GOING... DON&#39;T STOP! IT SCARED THE HOLY CRAP OUT OF HER. ALL THE SUDDEN I LOOKED OVER AND IT WAS AS IF THIS AIRCRAFT? THING HAD TURNED, WE WERE NOW PASSING EACHOTHER. I NO LONGER SAW THE BRIGHT LIGHT BUT WHEN I LOOKED OVER AGAIN...WHAT I SAW WAS HUGE! AT A GLANCE IT KIND OF HAD THE SHAPE OF AN OLD MILITARY HELICOPTER (THE GRASSHOPPER LOOKING KIND) BUT MUCH MUCH BIGGER. BIGGER THAN ANYTHING I HAVE EVER SEEN THAT COULD FLY. IT HAD ROWS OF LIGHT, WHICH APPEARED TO LOOK LIKE IT HAD DIFFERENT LEVELS TO IT. THE EASIEST WAY TO EVEN TRY TO DESCRIBE IT WOULD BE MY THOUGHT OF STANDING ON A CITY STREET IN THE DARK NIGHT AND LOOKING AT A FIVE TO EIGHT STORY BUILDING WITH LIGHTS ON IN SOME OF THE ROOMS, ON EACH LEVEL. I TOLD MY DAUGHTER...I HAVE GOT TO SEE THIS BETTER. I REMEMBER LOOKING BEHIND ME ON THE FREEWAY AND I ASKED MY DAUGHTER...CAN&#39;T ANYONE ELSE SEE THIS? PEOPLE HAVE GOT TO BE SEEING THIS! THERE WERE OTHER CARS FURTHER BEHIND US, I COULD SEE THEIR HEADLIGHTS. BEINGS I ALMOST WENT OFF THE SIDE OF THE ROAD ON THE FREEWAY, I TOLD HER I AM GOING TO GAS POINT, THE STREET WE WERE GETTING OFF AT, THEN I HAVE TO PULL OVER. I TOLD HER WE WOULD BE FURTHER AWAY AND WE WOULD BE OK. AS I EXITED OFF ON GAS POINT, I INSTANTLY STARTED LOOKING FOR IT. THERE WERE A FEW TREES IN THE WAY AND AS I GOT PASSED THEM I LOOKED ALL OVER FOR THE LIGHTS AND THEY WERE NO WHERE TO BE SEEN. POOF...JUST GONE. NOT A TRACE! I HAVE SHARED MY EXPERIENCE WITH A FEW PEOPLE, MOST MAKE A JOKE OUT OF IT. MY BIGGEST QUESTION...DID ANYONE ELSE SEE WHAT WE SAW? I CALLED AROUND TO SEE IF THERE HAD BEEN ANY REPORTS OF A SIGHTING. WOW! IT WAS LIKE I HAD THE PLAGUE. I WENT TO THE AIRPORT AND FUNNY AS IT SOUNDS, THE LADY AT THE DESK SAID THE WEIRDEST THING HAPPENED TO HER...IN THE MIDDLE OF THE DAY, SHE WAS OUT RIDING HER HORSE AND A BEAM OF LIGHT CAME OVER HER AND FOLLOWED HER FOR A SHORT WAY AND THEN IT WAS GONE. BUT, SHE HAD NO INFO. AND COULD NOT TELL ME WHERE TO GO TO FIND OUT IF ANYONE ELSE HAD SEEN THIS. I CALLED A RADIO STATION, A NEWS STATION, LEFT A MESSAGE AT THE PLANITARIUM, CALLED THE TOWER AT THE AIRPORT...NOBODY, I SAY NOBODY WANTED TO HEAR ANYTHING ABOUT IT. EACH PASSED THE BUCK AND NEVER EVEN ASKED SO MUCH AS A DESCRIPTION. I WAS VERY...I DON&#39;T EVEN KNOW HOW TO EXPLAIN JUST HOW I FELT. THATS WHEN I GOT ON THE INTERNET AND STARTED READING. ONE PERSONS DESCRIPTION WAS ALMOST WORD FOR WORD WHAT WAS SAID AND SEEN BY ME AND MY DAUGHTER.<n> <n><n> <n><n> AFTER READING THROUGH QUITE A BIT OF INFO. I REALIZED A FEW THINGS I WOULD LIKE TO LIST...WHERE WE SAW THIS THING DROP DOWN FROM A STAND STILL IS DIRECTLY ACROSS FROM AN AUCTION YARD.(NOW IS THE TIME ALL THE RANCHERS ARE MOVING THERE CATTLE FROM THE HIGHER ALTITUDES TO THE AREAS WITH MORE FEED, AND THE AUCTION YARD IS VERY ACTIVE AT THIS TIME.) THERE ARE QUITE A FEW LINES RUNNING THROUGH THE AREA AND QUITE A FEW OF THOSE ELECTRICAL LOOKING TOWERS ALL THROUGH THE AREA IT WAS SEEN IN. RIGHT OVER THE HILLS I SPOKE OF, BEING ALMOST DIRECTLY NORTH EAST OF OUR SIGHTING IS REDDING AIRPORT. OTHER THAN THAT OUR SURROUNDINGS ARE ALL MOUNTAINS. WE SIT IN A BIG VALLEY.<n> <n><n> <n><n> COTTONWOOD IS A RATHER SMALL PLACE. THERE&#39;S ALOT OF LAND SPREAD OUT. I JUST WONDER WHAT THE HECK BROUGHT THAT BIG OLE THING HERE? KEEP IN MIND, I WAS DRIVING. MY YOUNGSTER WAS WATCHING THE WHOLE TIME. SHE GOT A MUCH MORE DETAILED PICTURE OF THIS THING. SHE SAID...IF IT WERENT FOR THE LIGHTS ON IT, I WOULDN&#39;T OF BEEN ABLE TO SEE THE SHAPE OF IT.  QUITE AN EXPERIENCE, I WON&#39;T FORGET. WHAT SEEMED LIKE 20 MINUTES WAS ACTUALLY ONLY 2 MINUTES.<n>

From the CA State I15 hwy north to the I60 east to the I10 east to Palm Springs CA they stopped when we stopped at the whitewater turn off.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I told my wife as we were being followed to slow way down just to see if it was nothing but then it slowed to our speed too!  My 2 girls 12-13 were getting very jumpy as was my wife the driver.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Me, I didnt know what to think.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Finnaly I told her to pull off and stop. I wasn&#39;t going to take this thing home with us!  The lights then hovered over us pulsating in and out in a triangular formation.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I called the CHP and explained the situation.  They said they would have a car dispathced.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At the off ramp there was a trucker who was also looking up at the unusual activity in the night sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> But why where they following us?  We sat there for a good 10 mins waiting for the CHP and of course they never showed, when all at once they were gone just as fast as they showed up.

The object itself was very bright.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was speechless and my husband got mad at me when I couldn&#39;t just spit it out what I had seen.

That said, this event varies quite a bit from the former.<n> <n><n> <n><n> (2) I&#39;m a comprehensive mental health case manager for Volunteers of America, and am currently pursuing a masters in counseling psychology.  Anything that sounds like a definitive conclusion that I may mention I stress is purely speculative on my part.  I&#39;d like to think my background is fairly based in scientific observation.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This occurred at 6:25 pm on Friday, January 11, 2008.  I was in my car in Lake Charles, LA.  I had turned off 5th Avenue onto Prien Lake rd., headed east-bound towards the onramp onto interstate 2-10 west (where I was going to merge).  There is a fairly short distance between that corner and the onramp, perhaps a half mile.  I noticed up to my left something that I hadn&#39;t seen before.  I assumed it was a tower; Lake Charles is a fairly large town so it didn&#39;t surprise me that I had missed seeing it before.  The reason I thought it was a tower was because it appeared almost stationary, and was about the height of a tower top.  There was three white lights in a triangular formation, and along the back base was a blinking red light.  I thought for sure it was a tower top, yet when I kept trying to locate the actual tower itself, I couldn&#39;t see it.  It was dark, so I assumed that it was just obscured.  Then I realized it was moving.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At that point my onramp was coming up, so instead of pulling over and risk not being able to get a good shot of this thing, I merged onto 2-10 west-bound and grabbed my 5 megapixel digital camera out of my tech bag (I keep my PSP, DS, and cam in there when I spend a couple days away from my apartment).  The thing was moving slow still, from north to southwest.  I took an initial picture with the flash on, which looked like crap because of the glare of my dirty windshield.  I turned the flash off and took several more photos.  The thing disappeared over the southwest horizon just before I hit the 2-10 bridge of the Calcasieu ship channel.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I wouldn&#39;t have given this a second thought if the thing hadn&#39;t just *sat* in place while I passed it, and like I said, it seemed somewhat low over the Oak Park area of Lake Charles.  My camera picked up little more than taillights and darkness, except for one picture.  I had to adjust the brightness on it to see anything, but I believe I may have gotten it on the right side of the frame.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;ve been monitoring local media to see if anyone else saw it, but I&#39;ve heard nothing yet.  Traffic was fairly busy, too, at that time.  I will say this, too:  I&#39;ve been to Long Island, NY, so I know what real air traffic looks like.  We don&#39;t get that here, but as soon as this thing was out of sight, lots of planes with blinkblink-pause, blinkblink-pause white running lights started popping up all over.  I&#39;m not saying they were chasing anything, just that they were there in stronger numbers than I remember seeing before.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

But, I looked outside and I seen this bright light in the sky.  I watched these objects stay in one spot for at least 5 minutes in the same spot of the sky.  So I ran to my 2nd bedroom window in my apartment and that’s when the planes started coming from the western night sky. So I ran back to my kitchen window to see what was going to happen. When the planes came up to the sky, that’s when things got really interesting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When the planes came from the western sky, one of them went over the middle object since they were in the original spot from where I first saw them. When the plane went over the middle object, I lost track of the plane since I was focused on what the light was. I&#39;m not even sure what happened to the other plane, but I&#39;m sure both of them just took off. But, when the planes came to where the objects were, the objects started traveling north towards my apartment. I thought nothing of it since I thought it was a plane coming this way since there were two planes that came to the sky. So I was going to wash my dishes but I noticed that when the first object was coming towards my apartments, I got a bit nervous.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The first object had a bright yellow light in front of it and it looked like a plane coming since it had two red lights blinking on the sides of it. But when that went past my building, I started to clean my dishes. However, when the second object came by I ran to my other window because this object just took over the night sky. From my 2nd bedroom window, I noticed that it had a yellow light towards the front, followed by red lights that were in a pattern on the side of the object, then when I was beginning to lose sight of the object I ran to my other bedroom and I noticed that the second object was traveling upwards and I saw a bright yellow light on the bottom of this object. I lost track of this object since it continued traveling northward.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am not exactly sure how far apart these red lights were on the side of the object but since the object was very close to my apartment and it appeared to be over the residential area that was a little bit westward, I knew it was to low to be a plane. Not to mention the fact that both of these objects made absolutely no sound. But, back to the lights, there were only read lights on the side of the object and this was nothing that looked like a plane. There was no wing shaped object on this craft, the lights were lined up in a straight line. I believe there were about three or four red lights that were blinking in a pattern.<n> <n><n> <n><n> That’s pretty much what I can remember. I witnessed this from within city limits and I’m hoping others saw this as well. So if you’re in the area and saw something, please report it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.  PD))<n>

It simply vanished after five minutes. The object was brilliant white and seemed to &#34;hang&#34; and twinkle.  Some slight motion seemed to happen, but this could have been my eyes.  No shape was discernable, though it was not point-like. it seemed to have planet-like girth.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I know the night sky well and for a brief second thought it could be Polaris (was in the same general direction) but it was still too light out and no other stars were visible.  When it vanished, I knew something unusual was up.  It was not moving like a satellite, though I cannot rule out a large geo-synchronous object of some sort (ISS?) This could be checked I suppose.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It seemed to be lower than a star.  I can&#39;t say that for sure of course, but it appeared &#34;inside&#34; the atmosphere.  I do not have the ability to judge altitude.  The sky was perfectly clear and a few planes flew near it but made no approach.  After it disappeared, an old bomber looking plane flew over.  That was unusual but may have no bearing whatsoever on the sighting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> For the record, it was NOT Venus or any other planet.  Wrong side of the sky, way outside the orbital plane.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;m only making this report because this was an unusal event and perhaps other people saw it...<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Given the witness&#39;s experience with viewing the nighttime sky, we agree with his assessment that the object almost certainly could not have been a celestial body, i.e. a star or planet.  However, we have to address the possibility that the light might have been the landing light on an approaching a/c, possibly the bomber-like plane.  However, that is just a guess.  PD))<n>

The morning was overcast and smoggy.  The object is about 300 yards away in the middle of the river and I was on the 20th floor of the Everjoint Peninsula hotel. The four (4) separate videos were taken with a Kodak DX7590 digital camera.  1st video is taken without zoom and the object is right in the middle of the frame.  2nd video shot is about 15X zoom with panning of the surrounding area.  3rd video is 30X zoom.  The 4th picture is when the object disappeared.  The voice over is mine during the shoot.  I did not see the object disappear.  I was adjusting the zoom on the camera to take another shot when the object disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

I was on my way to work at ((deleted)) plant in Marysville, Ohio.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The time was about 6:25 AM.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was about three miles out of town before I entered the city limits when I spotted a round light in the north east.  I could also barely see the colors of the morning rising sun in the east, but the sun was still way below the horizon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The light I seen was not a star.  I am familiar with what the planet Venus looks like on certain mornings, and this light was not the planet Venus.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;m not sure how far or close it was to me, but if I was to hold out my arm, the object would seem to be about the size of a pea between my fingers.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What caught my attention with this object is rather than having a flashing strobe light like most airplane lights, this light was pulsating. It faded in and then faded out continuously. ( the speed of the fading in and out was no faster the the second hand of a clock ticking away.)  As far as I could tell, the light did not seem like it was moving in the sky, I can&#39;t be sure of this though as I was driving at the time of the sighting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The color of the light was white. There was only one light, not two or three like an airplane.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I observed the pulsating light for about thirty seconds as I drove along the highway curves, the light occasionly was obscured by trees as I was driving, and when I came through the trees into another clear shot view of the sky the light wasn&#39;t there anymore.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I didn&#39;t think much of what I saw, telling myself maybe it was a helicopter light, as I am not familiar with helicopter lights...maybe they have just one light that pulsates and fades in and out.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About a minute or so later I spotted the light again in the same spot in the distance...although, this time the light was not pulsating. It was a constant white light, no fading in or out. It also appeared to be stationary and not moving....I asked myself what this could be and I tried to observe it as much as I could while driving and trying to keep my car on the highway.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I observed the light for about another thirty seconds while it was constantly &#34;on&#34;.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I looked away just for a split second and then when I looked back the light had disappeared.I thought that maybe if it was a helicopter, it could have turned and the light would no longer be visible in my direction, but I closely observed the area where I had seen the light, and I did not see anything at all, no side view of a light, or no back view of an aircraft,it was as if the light had just disappeared into thin air.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am not so sure what this light was, it may very well have been a helicopter.<n>

I was facing W-SW when I finished my run, and turned to my right to end up facing NW.  I immediately noticed two stars in the constellation Cassiopeia that were very bright.  The stars were separated by a distance equal to the width of my thumb at arms length.  They were as bright as Venus, and equal to each other in magnitude.  I knew the stars were out of place, and thought I was witnessing some strange double supernova.  The sky was crystal clear without a hint of clouds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was thinking about looking them up and finding out what was going on when, as I was looking at them, they both faded simultaneously to the point of invisibility in about 4 seconds. I never took my eyes off of them through the whole event. I would say that I had been looking at them for about 30 seconds. They didn&#39;t belong there in the first place.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I could not make sense of what I was seeing, and still can&#39;t. The stars were stationary the whole time. At first I thought I might be looking at a couple of geosynchronous satellites that were rotating through a position of reflecting to non-reflecting, but the position was too far north of the Celestial Equator. I don&#39;t think we can place geosynchronous satellites in orbits that far off of the Celestial Equator.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I don&#39;t know what I saw, but I definitely saw it. I have asked several astronomy buffs, and some of my friends that work with satellites. No answer.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This seems to count as a UFO however high it was flying, and I just needed to let someone know other than my circle of friends.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Source indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

The light ended up disappearing after about 6 minutes.<n>

But these two objects were moving in perfect unison and they sounded like that metallic owl from that Clash of the Titans movie.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Well, it moved over my head very fast, faster than a plane or a helicopter but maybe less than half the speed of a meteor in the sky, and once it got to about 2 to 3 o&#39;clock in the western horizon, the globes disappeared but made a final birdlike sound about a 1/2 second after it disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Down by far the strangest thing I&#39;ve ever seen in my life.

Again they were moving too fast to be that.  They were moving from west to east.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then all of a sudden one of the objects makes a 90 degree turn in front of the path of the other object and they they both move off into a southerly direction.  There were some meteors last night but those were easy to differenciate.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then probably less than 5 minutes later we see a group of 3 red objects coming from the same direction all in parallel.

I could hear no sound, the road is busy at that time of day.  But definitely no standard aircraft engine noise.

But, I looked outside and I seen this bright light in the sky.  I watched these objects stay in one spot for at least 5 minutes in the same spot of the sky.  So I ran to my 2nd bedroom window in my apartment and that’s when the planes started coming from the western night sky.  So I ran back to my kitchen window to see what was going to happen.  When the planes came up to the sky, that’s when things got really interesting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When the planes came from the western sky, one of them went over the middle object since they were in the original spot from where I first saw them.  When the plane went over the middle object, I lost track of the plane since I was focused on what the light was.  I&#39;m not even sure what happened to the other plane, but I&#39;m sure both of them just took off.  But, when the planes came to where the objects were, the objects started traveling north towards my apartment.  I thought nothing of it since I thought it was a plane coming this way since there were two planes that came to the sky.  So I was going to wash my dishes but I noticed that when the first object was coming towards my apartments, I got a bit nervous.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The first object had a bright yellow light in front of it and it looked like a plane coming since it had two red lights blinking on the sides of it.  But when that went past my building, I started to clean my dishes. However, when the second object came by I ran to my other window because this object just took over the night sky.  From my 2nd bedroom window, I noticed that it had a yellow light towards the front, followed by red lights that were in a pattern on the side of the object, then when I was beginning to lose sight of the object I ran to my other bedroom and I noticed that the second object was traveling upwards and I saw a bright yellow light on the bottom of this object.  I lost track of this object since it continued traveling northward.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am not exactly sure how far apart these red lights were on the side of the object but since the object was very close to my apartment and it appeared to be over the residential area that was a little bit westward, I knew it was to low to be a plane.  Not to mention the fact that both of these objects made absolutely no sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> But, back to the lights, there were only red lights on the side of the object and this was nothing that looked like a plane.  There was no wing shaped object on this craft, the lights were lined up in a straight line.  I believe there were about three or four red lights that were blinking in a pattern.<n>
11/10/05 18:00|Bastrop|TX||15-20 minutes|This is the fourth report concerning the "lights" I have seen in the skies near Austin, Texas.  ((Possible spider webs??))|12/16/05|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/047/S47616.html|282|ndxe200511| This is the fourth report concerning the &#34;lights&#34; I have seen in the skies near Austin, Texas.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I placed lights in quotation marks because I am now convinced they were not lights at all but certainly had the appearance of a high altitude light, similar to a passing satellite.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It hs been my long experience that it is extremely dificult to judge the appearance, speed and altitude of objects seen in the sky from ground level.  Once while stationed at Holloman AFB NM, I viewed what appeared to be very fast moving objects flying over a nearby mountain range.  It turned out to be a flock of geese.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Since NM has always been famous for unexplained sightings it is easy to wrap one&#39;s brain around that possibility.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This evening I was able to focus my binoculars on the objects I have been seeing.  The result was blobs which I now believe are flying spider webs which are prevelant in this area.  The remaining problem in my mind is tht the objects do seem to speed up, slow down, and make turns which would not normally be the characteristic of wind borne objects.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I hope someone else will be able to provide additional sightings and info.<n>

I could tell of many sightings. The last sighting however was in Arizona. I work in telecommunications and I do a lot of traveling. This is a little out of date (Nov. 2005; date of the sightings) but I would like to share this with you because I read similar reports that occurred in Arizona.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My account lasted for an hour and a half. I had been out to Parker Dam working and was on my way back to Phoenix. When I got back on I-10 at Quartzsite, right at dusk, I noticed an orange/red light that illuminated out in open desert (South of I-10) that appeared to be no higher than a distant street light. When I saw it I knew that in that area there was nothing but desert. I watched it as I was driving and it faded out and disappeared. I wondered what it could have been but I had no idea. A few moments later on the left side of the highway (North of I-10) at a further distance and higher in the sky I saw another red/orange light, it appeared like it was turned on with a dimmer switch. It came on dim and increased to a bright illumination and inreverse went completely out. At this point I began watching. For the next hour as I was driving toward Phoenix I saw numerous red/orange lights appearing slowly then brightening only to slowly disappear as they appeared. Some of the lights appeared close and a few seconds after one would go out another would appear but at a much further distance and then close again. I called one of my co-workers and was telling him of what I was seeing. I called my wife back in Kentucky and was talking to her as I was witnessing the appearance and disappearance of these lights. Up to this point I was only seeing one light at a time sometimes they would be five minutes apart or as little as twenty seconds and would be miles apart. When I was east of Tonopah I saw one light come on and this time it stayed on. Then a second and third came on and just hovered. This time it was right! beside the interstate and I know others had to see them because there was steady traffic. These three lights were stationary and stayed on for close to a minute then they individually went off in the order they appeared. I stopped after these three came on and got out with my digital camera to see if I could get a picture but they went off before I had the chance. I waited for about twenty minutes and never saw them again that night. For an hour and a half I observed these lights. At first I thought possibly they could have been flares but realized after about the first twenty minutes these were definitely not flares.

((Venus??))|12/16/05|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/047/S47602.html|298|ndxe200511| Bright bell shaped object with pronounced light blue sphere shape encircling the bell with an amazing flying ability.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Approximately 1830 pm I pulled out of the company parking lot after work.  This company is located in Wolf Lake, Illinois.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I started for home turning left out of the company heading south on Highway 3 heading approximately 17 miles to Illinois 141 which heads west across the Bill Emerson Bridge into Missouri.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I noticed a very bright light in the sky that on first glance appeared to be a very bright star.  I went approximately 4 miles south and kept glancing at the light which was at approximately 3 o&#39;clock out my passenger side window and noticed that the light appeared then to be moving south and was paralleling at what appeared to be the same rate of speed.  I was driving the speed limit which was 55 miles per hour for that highway.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The light was very bright and as I continued south the light almost seemed to wobble as it moved through the air.  My best quess at it&#39;s was maybe 1500 to 2000 feet off the ground.  The light seemed to almost stop at one point and when I would slow down it seemed as if it would too.  As I got further south the light appeared to speed up and eventually I was watching it at about 1:00 o&#39;clock out of the windshield.  I watched it all the way to 141 and I turned due west on 141.  The light moved further south and west and it appeared to move over the Lonestar Concrete factory just south of Cape Girardeau and at that point I thought it must be a plane or chopper because this is the general direction of the Cape Girardeau Airport.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I never saw any aircraft blinking lights, it was a solid light with an erractic flying behavior.  At this point the light came back toward highway 141 and again seemed to parellel me as I crossed the Bill Emerson bridge.  I continued west toward Interstate 55 which is approximately 4 miles once you cross the bridge.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The light was south and slightly west but was moving back to the north as I neared the interstate.  Once I turned north onto I 55, the light then moved at a high rate of speed and again seemed to be parelleling me as I proceeded north on 55.  The light got much closer at this point and the appearance of wobbling as it moved was very visible and it began to take shape which was like a bell shape and at one point I could see a very distinct blue sphere of light encircling the bell shape.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I continued north bound now very intriqued as you can imagine and I kept my speed at 50 to 55 miles per hour because now the light was in 9 and 1000 o&#39;clock window out my driver side door.  My intended exit was the Jackson Missouri/Fruitland exit which is my exit to go home in Jackson.  This is approximately 10 miles from Cape were I got on the interstate.  The light was very bright and would speed up and slow down and even hover almost as if it was regulating it&#39;s speed to keep up with me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At this time I tried to call my wife to ask her to step out of our house and see if she could see the light although I doubt she could because the light was to low.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I exited off I 55 and turned left heading back south into Jackson.  Now the light was about in my 12:00 o&#39;clock position, very bright with the bell shape and the blue sphere.  As I drove south I tried to call my wife again.  This distance from the interstate to my turn off into my subdivision is approximately 4 miles.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The light then moved slowly to the west and I intentionally did not turn off at my subdivision because I wanted to see were the light would go.  I watched the light drift over the Jackson City Park which is near my house.  I then turned due west on route D in Jackson and drove about 1 mile turning left or south on to Broadridge.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The light drifted in front of me heading west and slightly south. There is a water tower on that side of the city and it made a great reference point as the light moved west of the tower.  I then turned immediately off of Broadridge onto a small dead end drive called independence medical street because it gave me a great viewing vantage point.  There were very few city lights to make it difficult to see the light.  The light then stopped south and west of me and south and west of the water tower.  It took on that distinct wobbling behavior and was very bright with the blue sphere intermitenly visible.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It should be noted that when I was on 141 I rolled my window down to hear if there would be any engine noise.  There wasn&#39;t.  And when I was watching the light from the last vantage point, I turned off my lights, turned off my truck, took the keys out of the ignition and I got out to watch and listen.. There was never any engine noise. At one point I turned my lights on and off and the light seemed to get brighter as if it was actually coming closer.  It stood stationary with only the wobbling effect and the appearance of moving slightly side to side.  It never moved for twenty minutes.  Finally the light appeared to move south and west and I lost sight of it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I know it wasn&#39;t an aircraft (airplane or helicopter) nor was it a star or anything else like I&#39;ve ever seen.…<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We do not know for certain what the witness observed, but we note that Venus is VERY prominent in the southwestern sky, at present.

Carmel. We were carrying on a conversation when my wife interupted and asked me what the blinking light outside my passenger window was in the sky. I figured since it was in the sky it was a plane and ignored what she was looking at. Again, she asked me about the light and this time looking for it where she was pointing, it moved from us observing it from the passenger window of my car to the driver&#39;s side. Having caught my attention with the rapid rate of speed, what had me in awe was now it was stationary. We were unable to make out a shape due to the cloud cover, but the lights spread at a pattern to large to be a plane. They now appeared dirrectly above us as I drove into town. I found myself leaning as hard as I could on my steering wheel to observe these odd lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The lights burst through the clouds reminding me of powerful spot lights or explosions, except the lights would flash in the exact same position in different patterns. The lights appeared to be a fire orange, but again more as a powerful spot light not a flame. Going from two to six to four, it changed constently flashing a different number of lights every second.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I immediatley called a co-worker from my cell phone to see if he could see the ligths from the town to the east of us. Picking up his phone the first words were not hello, but &#34;What are those lights in the direction of your house?&#34;. Soon after the phone call the lights disappeared from what I could see, but the co-worker could still see them. I had turned around with no luck of resighting the strange lights. The next day I spoke with the co-worker and he advised he had seen the same type of pattern of lights. The only difference was that he described them in an orb shape. Another co-worker had heard the conversation and said she had seen the same type of orb shape with the same description of lights. I still am curious as to what could have caused not only a huge area of lighting, but to be able to move at the witnessed speed of the lights. Especially to come to a halt after the rapid speed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.  PD))<n>

I was taking pictures of the sunset with my camera phone.  I had taken a few pictures of it, and out of nowhere, a circular object appeared off the driver&#39;s side of the vehicle, or south of Hwy 50.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This object hovered, seemingly matching my vehicle speed.  It was changing colors slowly from a shimmering green to a shimmering yellow. I was able to take a photograph, with my camera phone of this object.  It remained off my port side for about another 30 seconds, then in the blink of an eye, took off to the west, upwards at approximately 30 degree angle.  It looked like a shooting star, going the opposite direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Our camp was in a tight river valley, between two mountains. The air temperature was 10 degrees Fahrenheit, with clear skies and no wind. (calm) The valley is approximately 700 yards wide. I saw a craft come down off of Morrison Mountain, following the contour of the ground about 250 ft from the surface. It went by us, 100 ft to the north, and continued along the river valley, and went around Blacktail Mountain out of our line of sight. The craft was traveling 25 mph and made no noise at all. The craft had intense white lights and flashing red lights. The lights however did not illuminate the ground or trees which was odd because it was very close to the ground. The craft was 20 feet long.<n>

11/7/05 20:00|Bridgewater|NJ|Unknown|2+ hours at this point|Strange Lights Over Central Jersey 11/07/05 Manville, Bridgewater, Somerville area|11/8/05|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/047/S47532.html|327|ndxe200511| Strange Lights Over Central Jersey 11/07/05 Manville, Bridgewater, Somerville area<n> <n><n> <n><n> Around 8 PM EST, a cluster of lights was seen in the Manville-Bridgewater, NJ area.  These objects were much lower to the ground and moving much slower than traditional aircraft.  I can say this with certainty because there were planes simultaneously flying in the area (there were much higher and faster).<n> <n><n> <n><n> These objects seemed to ascent individually, one at a time.  Each ascended at an angle similar to that of a plane taking off--but this inclined ascent was done from mid-air, not from the ground.  In one instance, an ascending object appeared to come very close to a jet in the air.  After watching 2-3 do this, I lost track of the objects.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About an hour later, I saw another cluster of lights in approximately the same area of the first cluster (within several miles of each other--at the most).  This cluster more resembled a constellation than the previous one, almost like the Big Dipper where one can visually connect the objects in an ascending line.  Again, these objects were much lower to the ground and much slower moving than aircraft that was simultaneously in the same airspace.  At times, it seemed that these objects disappeared, and then reappeared shortly thereafter.  However, I did not witness the process of re-appearance because I was traveling home in a car by this point.  It is now approximately 90 minutes after I first saw this strange occurrence, and I cannot see these lights from my home.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have never reported a UFO sighting in my life, and never before today had I ever believed I saw UFOs.  However, this occurrence was incredibly unusual, and I genuinely feel that what I witnessed was likely alien related.  I am hoping that other people in Central Jersey saw this too and will come forward as well.<n>

Not that I was seeing the same object. But it was really something to see. If anyone could just give me friendly email to let me know, it would be very much appreciated.

We used to go out in the cat tails and and pat down a circle and hang out together. One evening it was getting dark, and we all decided that we should probably get going. We all stood up and, when one of my friends looked up and said hey look at that! I looked up and to my surprise was three star looking objects in a triangle. the wierd thing is that this tringle of three star looking objects were so high up that they looked to be up in space, and also that they were moving at a slight angle straight up into space. As far away as they were ( if you held out a marble in your fingers that&#39;s about how spaced they were), the triangle had to be so far apart I can&#39;t even begin wonder how far apart they were to make that triangle. They just kept moving almost staight up into space tell we couldn&#39;t see them. This all happenend in a matter of about 20 to 30 seconds. Very impressive. I hope I am not wasting your time, but after seeing that I have always been very interested.<n>

I took my dog out to use the bathroom.<n> <n><n> <n><n> While waiting on him, a light caught my eye.  My first thought was it was a Bright star we have seen in the sky for months now that twinkles.  As I looked at it my thought changed.  We live in a flight path of our air port and often on hazy nights when planes come in their lights look orange.  Having a love for aviation I always watch planes flying by.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I was watching the stationary bright orange light that appeared low in the horizon, suddenly a second light light up just adjacent to the first as it went out, then a third light further away light up and the second one went out.  Each lasting about 2-3 seconds.  All of the lights seemed to be in a horizontal plane.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I could not believe what i just saw, I stood there watching the sky.  About 3-4 minutes later watching the same area the sky lit upwith about 6-7 more of these bright orange lights all seemed to be in the same horizontal plane all lasting 2-3 seconds.  None of the lights lit up at the same time but some were overlapping( one was going out as another was lighting up). after the last one went out I did not see any more.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As the last one went out my dog that was now inside started barking. I went inside and my wife had called me just as the last one went out and he was barking at the phone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I dont know what I saw, I have never seen a UFO before but this was very weird.  The area where they lit up was over wet land and a portion of state route 31 not where there are any people.  The sky was not 100% dark and I could not make out any shape behind them and the lights did not move and they all looked alike and they made no sound and no low flying aircrafts around. there were planes at like the 30000 feet flying way above this area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What ever it was I freaked me out a bit and made me wonder what I saw.  I just thought I would share what i saw with everyone else in case anyone else saw it too.<n>

From ground level it is impossible to verify the height, shape or speed of the object, however it seems to be extremely high in the sky.

It was an afternoon in early November. The whole day had been overcast and you couldn&#39;t see anything but low, dark clouds.. the sun was never in sight. We were heading home over the Pensacola bridge, which is really long.. I was in the passenger seat looking out over the water, where I saw a very bright orange glowing something-or-other with 3 smaller orange glowing something-or-others hovering around it. We were going about 65 miles an hour and it appeared that the 4 objects were stationary. I always bring my digital camera when we go to P-Cola, so I moved quick to grab it and take a picture. When I finally got the camera on and ready, the 3 smaller objects were gone and only the large one remained. I managed to get one picture.. I didn&#39;t get anymore because I must have looked away for just long enough, that when I tried to capture it again, it was gone. I know we couldn&#39;t have been the only ones that saw it. There was plenty of traffic on the bridge and there were quite a few people fishing from the shore that was directly facing where the objects had been. It sucks that I didn&#39;t get a better or long enough view of the objects.. it all happened so quickly.. but I can still see it in my mind of it hovering below the cloudline. Like I said, I don&#39;t know what it was or that it was anything strange, even though it seemed totally out of place to anything I&#39;ve ever seen in the sky. Some people bring up that it might have been flares.. could be. I don&#39;t remember seeing or hearing any passing aircrafts that would have been dropping them though. Other than that, what could it have been? It was in our immediate atmosphere, in the middle of the day, it couldn&#39;t have been any falling stars, comets or any of that stuff, could it? It wasn&#39;t no damn weather balloon, either. Who knows? I just know it was weird and I now count myself amongst the many others! who cla im to have seen such strange things in the skies... The funny thing is, I was watching another TV show about UFO&#39;s, and they were talking about all of the Gulf Breeze (which is right next to P-Cola) activity from a while back.. and in one of the many pictures they showed that had been taken by a witness, was a picture of pretty much what we saw that day, but they got a shot of all 4 objects together... hhhhmmmm???<n>

It was moving much slower than an airplane and made absolutely no sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After about 20 seconds of watching this object it did something very weird, fire fell off of it.  It looked like some one poured a flaming liquid out of this object, at first the steam of fire coming out was brite yellow and then it changed to orange and then vanished.  If the object was say fifty feet in diameter then the steam of fire was 150 feet long.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As we watched, fire fell off three different times and then the whole object made a very sudden slow right turn and headed east, as it headed east the object began to turn a dull orange and then it vanished into the night sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am 55 years old and my daughter is 26 and neither of us has ever seen anything like this in our lives.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thank you for your website!

I am familiar with the the visual sensation known as hysteresis I.e., a light will seem to move if stared at for a time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> While observing the night sky near Austin TX at about 6:15 pm,  I noticed a light in the high western sky which was barely discernable moving approximately south to north.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I assumed it was a satellite, but it soon started to turn in a curving motion.  It also slowed to almost a stop and then accelerated sharply.  The actions it took could not have been that of a satellite or high flying aircraft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I kept sight of the light for at least 2 or 3 minutes before I lost it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A few minutes later I picked up another light with similar actions.  As stated it had all the appearance of a high flying satellite but no satellite could possible move like this light.   Anyone else closely observing the night sky at this time could not have failed to see the same movement as I did.  I would like to know if this happened or if there is a natural explanation for what I saw.  I saw something similar several moths ago but did not report it.<n>

We see aircraft passing all the time, on their approach to Burbank, or LAX.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were talking, when I heard an aircraft over head.  We both looked up to what appeared to be a military transport. flying or gliding behind and to the left and right of the tail were several (6 to 7) objects. The objects were to close to the aircraft to be escorting type aircraft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I thought the aircraft could be dragging ballons behind the craft to be release at some point during flight.  From our point of view the objects appeared round and black in color.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My husband pointed out that we wouldn&#39;t be able to see ballons.<n> <n><n> <n><n> By the time I got my binoculars focused, the aircraft disapperaed into a cloud formation.<n>

I was driving and to our right, over a huge open field high up in the sky, were 9 lights (grouped in 3&#39;s) forming a huge triangle. They were slowly rotating as one large object. (The lights were at the corners of the object and were a bright glowing white.)<n> <n><n> <n><n> After one of the 3 groupings &#34;broke off&#34; from the formation and started following us.  They were not behind us, though.

We observed three (3) circular craft with rotating lights that were red,white,blue. (no kidding) that ran vertical then switched to horizonal this went on for at least a half an hour. we observed these crafts moving horizonal for some distance then they would go straight down and stay there for several minutes then back up to a completely different location in the cloudless night sky. These were no flares! Flares don&#39;t asend and move horizonal..They float down and leave a smoke trail..I couldn&#39;t deterime a distance for these lights. It could of been several miles away but close enough you could see the lights alternating with the naked eye..when you used binoculars they were really clear and evident that they were circular crafts. Some seem to be bigger or closer than the others. These were not military aircraft from luke air base! we could clearly see those jets and their strobe lights flying around in the night sky. On other occasions I believe we saw flares from Gila Bend gunner range to the south of us..These like some of the others we have saw defy explanation.

I live several miles Northwest of Point Mugu Base.  Several miles north of Port Hueneme Naval Base.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had just walked from my garage going towards the back of the house when I noticed a rod shape object north in the sky.  The object was the size of three football fields and had a red light at the front tip and back tip.  The lights were connected by a dark mass.  Since this object was traveling diagonal from me it is hard to give an exact description of the shape for I was seeing it at a side view.  It was low in the sky for something that huge.  I would say approximately a mile off the ground.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object moved slowly... guided.  There was no noise.  It headed from my north toward the Point Mugu base.  I got excited and ran into the house and called my brother (44 years old).  He came out and I pointed the object in the sky to him.  Once he spotted it I ran back in and called my father.  He came out with me and I asked my brother where the object was.  It was no longer visible for the house was in the way.  We all waked toward the front but were unable to locate the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We lost sight of the object roughly at where the Point Mugu base is located.  After calming down I went upstairs and looked out the window.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I saw another object and ran downstairs.  I called my brother again and we walked out, along with my nephew (10 years old).  I showed him the object in the sky but this was strange.  It appeared as if something was chasing something else in the sky.  I told he to listen... we could hear jets in the sky.  From where I live you are able to hear military jets from Point Mugu base.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I must have looked at the sky for an hour but so nothing more.<n>
11/5/05 19:55|Porterville|CA|Fireball|approx. 2 min.|A bright red glowing light that was loosing altitude coming from the western sky and going east towards the horizon|11/8/05|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/047/S47478.html|369|ndxe200511| A bright red glowing light that was loosing altitude coming from the western sky and going east towards the horizon<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was a bright red glowing light.  At first my wife and I thought someone had fired off some fire works but then we noticed that it lasted way to long and the trajectory did not match that of a fire cracker.  Then we thought it was an airplane but the light also shortly after certainly was not that of a plane. So we thought possibly it was a meteorite but we have never seen a meteorite last as long as this light did and it got closer and closer to the horizon and then it disappeared.  I have seen some interesting sights over the years such as the Northern Lights when I lived in Washington and when I made trips to Canada but this was unique.  I do not believe that life from other planets, similar to ourselves, is visiting us because of the technology that would have to be obtained and that even at the speed of light it would take milleniums just to travel any where in the universe.  I do believe in higher life forms of an angelic type but  such contact at this point in time would be of those angels that have rebelled against man&#39;s creator and are actually enemies of mankind which is reflected in 2 Corinthians 11:14, 1 John 5:19 and Revelation 12:9.  But I strongly do not believe that this situation has anything to do with what we saw. I would like a logical explaination for this unidentified red light appearance.  Was the red light caused by some type of natural occurance or was it man made?  After my wife saw the light she told me that a teen age son of a friend of ours saw the same type of light last night.  He shared this with my wife this afternoon at about 1 pm when my wife was visiting with his mother.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The bottom of the disc was visible just under the fog and I could see a dish shaped antenna on the bottom of the craft. It was a grey color and about 150 feet across.  I was about 100 feet away from it and could see clearly that it had a dish attached to the bottom of it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I took some pictures and made a sketch of it when I got home.

It was a beautiful dry fall day, puffy white clouds, bright blue sky. I was watching various airpanes and passenger jet planes pass over and under one another.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then I looked up to the east at about 75 degrees about the horizon.  I was astonished to see a flying object, which at that moment, looked like a horizontal, silver beverage can, moving faster that the jets in a north by northwest direction.  I saw it for a few moments only before it quickly moved beyond eyesight a few seconds and into the clouds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A few moments after the object moved off two dark, fast moving jets flew overhead moving east from the direction of Columbus, Ohio.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It surprised me because it looked like a large flying soda can.  It must have been quite large as it was so obviously out of place, by that I mean the sense of seeing it up in the clouds for a moment was like a cartoon effect.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have no idea how many miles away it was from where I stood, but seeing it again in my memory it must have been enormous.<n>

I took several pictures of the trees, this is the only one with this object in it. I honestly do not know what it is. My roommate thinks it something on the lens, my camera lens is very small, I do not think something was on the lens,if so, it did not show up on any other pictures.

There were no other vehicles in my sight---either ahead or behind me.  I had just done an illegal U-turn, as I had started heading in the wrong direction on a one way divided highway.  It was a clear night: the stars were very visible.  At the top of my windshield I immediately noticed a VERY bright--brighter than any stars or planets--spherical or possibly oval shaped white light heading towards the southeast at a VERY steep angle.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was such a steep angle, and it was moving SO fast that I thought at first it must be a HUGE meteorite (it looked like the size of a small house)--and it was going to crash.  I awaited the inevitable flash of light (assuming there would be a flash), but there was only silence.  There had been no noise before it hit/landed either. Also, there was no tail (or trail) attached like a meteor would exhibit.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have seen dozens of meteorites during my lifetime---either in meteor storms or other times---and this was NOTHING like that.  This was, in fact, like nothing I have EVER witnessed before.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This object was incredibly bright---much brighter than any meteor I have ever seen---and moved VERY fast. It was much slower than a shooting star (meteorite), but much, much faster than anything else I have ever seen in my life.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was not a plane or a jet or a helicopter. The object moved from my view at the top of my windshield to the ground in less than 3 seconds. No man-made vehicle can move that fast. And yet, I know it was not a meteor. (At the very least I am extremely certain it was not.)<n>

Was just told about this from a friend who witnessed an object as he was returning home from a late shift at a restaurant. He was hesitant to share this story with anyone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Lighted object.  Best described as ice cream cone shaped with two additional triangular protrusions at the base of the cone.  No sharp edges to this lighted object, more of a hazy perimeter.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Object moved east to west basically following the path of a major road.  Low altitude, maybe 150 feet.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Witness was driving toward object, pulled into middle turn lane and watched as it went directly overhead.  Witness pulled off road, got out of car to continue watching.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Object made no sound whatsoever.  As object floated by, all that could be seen from the &#34;backside&#34; of the object was the uppermost outline of the cone and a slight glow of light into the night sky.  The bottom portion seemed to have just disappeared.<n>

So I was listening to the wind and looking at the stars I noticed what sounded like a flag whipping in the wind directly above my head.  I looked up and immediately saw a very large delta or wedge shaped object flying over the house at a high rate of speed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object was larger than my house (2200 sq. ft. 3 bedroom single floor brick home with an attached 3 bay garage).  The object appeared to be no more than 150 - 200 feet above the ground.  It was travelling North to South at what appeared to be around 200 - 250 mph.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As it passed directly overhead it made no discernable noise except for the sound of &#34;wind&#34; rustling by.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It emitted no light and has no distinguishing features on it other than what appeared to be two corrugations in the skin from the front to the rear of each &#34;wing&#34; (two on each wing).<n> <n><n> <n><n> The color of the object was difficult to make out, but it appeared to have a grey color to it.  I couldn&#39;t make out any sort of &#34;cockpit&#34; nor could I see any windows or other points of entry on the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As the object passed overhead, I exclaimed, &#34;Holy ((deleted))!&#34;, jumped out of my chair, turned around as it passed over.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I then grabbed a high-intensity flashlight the was hanging around my neck and shined it upon the object.  However, the object cast no reflection, so it was either much higher in altitude than what it appeared or the surface properties of the object were such that it absorbed the light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I was shining the light I was running around the corner of the house (West) towards the drive way in order to keep the object in view.  However, by the time I reach the driveway (3 seconds) the object has disappeared from view over the neighbors house and tree line acorss the street to the South.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The entire incident lasted no more than 5 - 8 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I rushed in the house to tell the others what I had seen.  I went out to the front lawn (facing South) with my Mother trying to see it the object might come back in view.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As we were looking South I saw a large green meteor shoot dowm at about a 60 degree angle and disappear behind the tree line on the horizon about two miles away.  I don&#39;t think this was related to what I had witnessed moments before, as a meteor shower was scheduled for later that night.  I DO however, know that the object that flew over my house was NOT a meteor.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As a side note:  There are two large Air Force bases here in Oklahoma.  Tinker AFB is located just Southeast of OKC and is only about 30 minutes from my house.  There is also Altus AFB in Altus, OK, in the Southwest of the state near the Texas border.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have never witnessed any sort of B2 stealth bomber flying in or out of either these AFB&#39;s, especially ones that emitted no sound from the engines.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I an a Navy veteran and my Father is a retired Army Major pilot and we have access to both of these military installations, and have never seen anything like that flying around these installations.<n>

One was completely still, and the other was moving toward the first from the west.  The second light reached the first, and completely circled it, bottom to top.  It did this quickly, whihin 3 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then both lights moved away from each other: one moving west the other moving east.  I thought at first they were helicopters, but there were no flashing lights, just a constant bright white light, even while they were moving away from our direction.  I don&#39;t believe a helicopter could fly below, up the side, over the top, and down the side of another all within 3 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I wouldn&#39;t have thought much of the lights if they hadn&#39;t circled like that.<n>

I noticed what appeared to be a satellite, moving west to east.  It was the brightest I&#39;d ever seen, however--brighter than Mars or Sirius.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I watched it cross the sky for a couple of minutes, surprised at its brightness and speed... but when it was close to being overhead (it was slightly to the North, rather than directly overhead),  I realized that it was actually a cluster of three lights, one on top and two below.  Nothing was flashing or blinking, which is why I thought it was a satellite at first; the lights were steady and extremely bright.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At this angle, they were distinct. The lower lights were smaller in diameter, but just as bright.  The object seemed too bright to be a satellite.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After another minute or so it disappeared over the eastern horizon.<n>

The night was mild for November and clear.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I paused to look up at the stars above the roof of my house.  Movement to the east caught my attention.  I looked east and there were 15-20 (best guess) objects flying very high, I would guess 30,000 feet, from east to west.  They may have been higher than that but I have no idea how large the craft were so I have nothing to base a better judgement on.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They were in a line that formed north to south but it wasn&#39;t an organized line.  As they flew the line flucuated as to which &#39;craft&#39; was in the lead.  It reminded me of how a flock of geese act when they are trying to decide which will lead the flock until the V formation is made.  They were illuminated a blue/white but were high enough that I could not determine a shape.  They resembled small blueish stars.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Although they were flying at high altitude and a high rate of speed I was still able to stay focused on them from east to west.   At the rate they seemed to be traveling I would guess it was would have taken a very short time for them to cross the distance (east to west) of Illinois.  I heard no sound, either before I caught sight, during nor after.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I did not observe any contrails from them.  The illumination seemed steady, not flashing and only the blue/white hue.  No orange, red or yellow at all.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I did not observe any other aircraft in the night sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At the time there were no clouds to speak of.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

11/4/05 00:30|Guilford|CT|Unknown|10 seconds|Fast moving bright light that instantly disappeared with a trace.|11/8/05|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/047/S47423.html|393|ndxe200511| Fast moving bright light that instantly disappeared with a trace.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I will state my background first-  I am a computer programmer with a relatively high IQ.  I am an active Private Pilot.  I live almost directly under the Madison, CT VOR navigation station.  Nightly, I watch helicopters, small planes, and airliners fly above my house.  All aircraft are required to have operating navigation lights, and anti-collision lights.  I can generally classify aircraft based on relative velocity, and the type of engine.  In the 40 degree weather we are having, even turbofan engines at 35,000 are clearly audible. The navigation lights are always visible, and at most angles, the anti-collison &#34;strobe&#34; can be seen.  There is no weather currently, and all stars and planets are extremely clear.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Tonight, as I stood on my deck, I witnessed an &#34;aircraft&#34; with only 1 VERY bright light that was moving quickly enough that the alitude would have to have been VERY low, or the velocity was extremely high.  This caught my attention.  It traced a path above my house in only a few seconds, when an airliner can take a minute.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The light distinguished ((sic--extinguished??)), and I waited for the engine noise, only none came- just total silence.   I could not see the shape, only a bright light.  There was no further sign of it.  It was visible for a few seconds as it appeared to come from over the horizon to about 70 degrees vertical above my house.  I was facing easterly, so the path was roughly south to north.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The light was far, far brighter than the landing lights, anti-collision lights, or navigation lights on any aircraft I have ever seen.  I have witnessed dozens of &#34;shooting stars&#34; over my house as recently as the shower this summer, and it did not, in any way resemble the intensity, path, or time that a meteor has.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The light extinguished instantly as if it was turned off, and did not appear to burn out as a meteor does. I don&#39;t know what else to say-<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am baffled enough to write this.  I hope someone else in Connecticut saw this event and may shed some light on it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  The ISS was not visible from Guilford on this date, at this time.

It lasted between 30 and 45 minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The &#34;objects&#34; did not seem to be opaque, but almost like circles of light.  We also noticed extensions from the sides, almost like wings which made a flying or flapping motion.  They flew in patterns, almost parallel at times, and other times in more opposite figure eight-like patterns.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They most interesting thing they did was occasionally &#34;collide&#34;, after which they would ricochet apart and fly randomly until they got back into some kind of pattern.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were not afraid, because they appeared almost &#34;playful&#34; in nature.  There were no sounds that we could hear.  In addition, there was a strange flashing behind four clouds, which were close together.  The flashes would jump in sequence from one cloud to the next, although sometimes it would skip one of the four clouds, and only flash behind the other three.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Possible advertising lights??

I noticed as I moved south that this &#34;star&#34; was moving-ever so slowly up-in the five or so minutes it doubled altitude.  I would guess it to be about 10 miles out-since I could clearly see the planes coming in from the north over the mountains with their strobes and red lights on.  Mc Claren Airport would be about 20 miles from where I first saw the light (&#34;star&#34;).<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I approached the city the &#34;star&#34; had gained altitutde and then slowly just winked out.

I&#39;ve seen plenty of meteors and a few satellites fall and crash into the atmosphere (a sight to behold if you&#39;ve never had the priviledge!!!  Quite a light show!) but never anything like this.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was gazing at the stars at 8:00 p.m. while talking to a friend over the phone.  All of a sudden on the left skyline (would be east I suppose) a faint string of lights came flying across the sky in a V-shaped pattern.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The lights were very faint but still obvious to the naked eye.  They didn&#39;t blink either, not even flicker, and each light was perfectly intervalled with the next.  It looked like a flock of birds really, except that I haven&#39;t found a species YET that can illuminate in flight!<n> <n><n> <n><n> This V-Shaped string of lights &#34;flapped&#34; its &#34;wings&#34; while in flight and sped across the sky with a speed never duplicated by any of the man made aircraft I&#39;ve seen (and I live fairly close to the airport, I&#39;ve seen MANY planes come in, this was NO PLANE!!!)<n> <n><n> <n><n> As the craft was exiting to the western skyline, it &#34;straightened&#34; out and did a spiral like move, holding the shape of a circle for a few moments before looping back out into the flying V, and then it disappeared over the horizon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This entire show took only about 20-30 seconds before it disappeared into the night and I never heard the sound of an engine or anything remotely distinguishable as such.  Again, I&#39;ve never seen anything move like this, and certainly never this fast.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There were commercial airplanes in the sky at the same time this craft flew through, and they took easily 5 minutes or more to clear the amount of sky that this craft breezed through in 30 seconds!<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;m happy to see that others have reported very similar sightings in other areas.

There was extensive cloud cover and a fairly brisk breeze blowing the clouds along. I looked up and saw a glowing elliptical object moving below the clouds. It was yellow/white in the center and reddish/orange around the edge. Their were no blinking lights and no sound. It appeared to be about three times the size of Mars right now which is on a close approach to Earth. I had the object in sight for about 5-6 seconds before it slipped into the clouds and was gone. A short time later the clouds blew out and I could see the stars of Cassiopeia in the area where the disc was. I was so sure of what I saw I called the local police to report it and leave my number in case anyone else saw it. I am a MUFON investigator and will be filing a report with MUFON.<n>

The light was red so my mother and I were just waiting on the exit ramp for the light to change.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I noticed an unusual object hanging in the sky above the trees at my 2 o&#39;clock.  I thought it must be attached to the top of a very tall antenna hidden by the trees because it did not move.  Viewed from this angle it had the shape of a pan of Jiffy Pop (halfway popped) without a handle.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The &#34;pan&#34; was solid with a row of white lights set into the side. The rounded top appeared to be a framework of wire with a hazy, gauzy covering sort of like the angelhair that people put on Christmas trees.  I thought I could see through the framework because the rounded part of the object was the same color as the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I observed the object for about a minute.  It did not move and the lights didn&#39;t move in that time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Suddenly, the lights flashed a couple times and the object turned on its edge showing us the &#34;top&#34;. Then it looked like a frisbee, on edge, suspended in air for a second or two.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then it flew away on edge so quickly we were startled.  It was still the same color as the sky giving the illusion that we could see through it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Traffic had started to move when the lights blinked so I could only follow the object from my 2 o&#39;clock to my 5 o&#39;clock.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My mother turned to follow it but it was gone.<n>

It was a dark metallic brown and black craft which reflected the fading sunlight.  The base was round with two small spikey pertrudances jutting from the side of the base opposite of one another.  Atop the base was a slanted dome that from afar looked as if it had a superstructure that looked as if it were made of wire-mesh, resulting in a cross-hatched pattern.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It travelled in the same direction that the dome was slanted in.  When I saw it, it wobbled for about ten second, moving slowly across the sky, before it quickly picked up speed and flew away, becoming smaller and smaller before it became a tiny dot, when it flew out of sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This craft conforms to no pictures or descriptions that I have personally seen or heard of.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Student report.

I thought &#34;Not a jet, because a jet&#39;s tail extends behind it and stays in the sky looking like a whitish line and this ain&#39;t doing THAT!&#34;.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So I continued to watch this fireball moving across the sky, not super fast but definitely not slowly either!  The tail stuck right with it, both a beautiful, blazing  bright yellow-orange color....in other words, a fireball.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I called a friend immediately, told her what I was observing and what I took it to be--a UFO.  By this point, I couldn&#39;t see the object anymore, not one trace or hint of anything having been up in the sky moments earlier.  I kept looking up in all directions-nothing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then maybe 2 minutes later I heard what sounded like jet engines overhead but could see absolutely NO SIGN  of any type of plane, not when I first heard the &#34;jet engines&#34;, not before I heard anything and after losing sight of the UFO and not after the sounds were gone.

The way we figured out that it wasn&#39;t from this planet object was because it was way to high for a plane.  After we decided to go to the bus stop and about 10-15 minutes later i looked at the sky and we werent sure if it was the same object or another, but the second one we saw was very light then it turned out and it gained speed, then we lost it.<n>

Appearing in a group like shooting stars in their nature.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A few secs later i saw a bright glowing ball appear in the sky in this same area, an object i would call a fireball and move with less speed also East to West and vanish behind a cloud and for a moment causing lighting of the cloud. It did not see it come out of the other side.  More so i had my camera with me and i GOT THE THING in 3 PICS! I saw no signs of intelligent flight, but i can say it seemed to slow down as it moved and was VERY bright and color shifted from yellow to red.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Obviously if i had time to raise my camera and snap 3 photos it was not moving nearly as fast as what a shooting star&#39;s nature would be.  I was able to keep sight of the object for about 8 secs on its pass over.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On the largest photo you can see Mars and get an idea of the level of zoom was minimal  (did not have time to zoom)  Object was moving about 5 times as fast as a jet would cross the sky and was EXTREMELY bright when you compare it to Mars and realize how bright Mars was in the nighttime sky to your eye. I had my camera against a tree and the streaking does not appear in Mars only in this object.  Light it was giving off seemed to flicker and was very unusual in appearance besides the color change.<n>

We were anchored off the Northwest corner of Norman Island.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The night was very clear and all of the stars were extremly bright.  As I was laying in my berth looking out of the hatch, an object appeared.  It was oval in shape and had 2 sets of white lights around the outer edge.  It moved from North to South.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After the object passsed by the first hatch I sat up and looked through the secong as it passed by that one.  I moved to the deck area to find it continuing South until it was out of sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was difficult to determine the size as it was diffcult to determine how high it was.

The shape is indistinct but one can see the changing colors (green, red, white) with the naked eye.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It is impossible to judge the size, altitude or distance from us.  It appears about 23:00 and disappears very gradually into the distance in 30-45 minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Last night we could see it moving up, down and side to side abruptly but never too far from its original position.

The object was in the western sky and much nearer the horizon so that we had our backs to Mars as we watched the object. We observed the object with binoculars which made the changing colors, not just a distorted shimmer but a flashing, more apparent. It isn&#39;t the usual &#39;twinkle&#39;.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I checked periodically last night waiting for the object to appear and when I looked out about 23:00, there it was. The night before last, it was moving very distinctly in small increments back and forth and up and down. That&#39;s what really threw us. It didn&#39;t move as much last night. Springfield is 110,000 people and we live about 5 or 6 miles east of town and the last few nights the atmosphere has been very clear and absolutely beautiful, but I don&#39;t see any body behaving or looking like this.

It took a second to realize that no house&#39;s or business&#39;s were in that direction so I focused more intensily and it looked like a rectangular object with slanted sides and it just started to move slowly to the right and off it went up to the right on an angle and disappeared.

At first I simply thought it was a light flashing from an airplane, however, as I searched the sky I could see another airplane off to the left traveling southeast with it&#39;s lights flashing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The plane was further in the distance, but I was actually able to discern the form of the plane when its lights flashed.  But, the other light I saw was bigger and closer, but there was no form of an airplane visible.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I continued to observe the sky to see if I could follow the path of the light object to determine if it was a plane.  I continued to see this light flash quite a few times in various random places in the sky.  It did not travel in a straight-line movement like a plane, but somewhat in a wide zig-zag pattern, but more random--and it appeared to move towards my house.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The sighting ended in an instant with a large burst or flash of light energy.  The light that was round--morphed or opened up into a long rod shape (about a 180 degrees angle), and almost instantly disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At this time the object was nearly overhead and to my right, which was a west northwest direction.  After the large burst, I continued to search the sky for another few minutes to see if I could find this object, but it was simply gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Incidentally, there was absolutely no airplane sound or any other sound associated with this sighting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I hedged about whether or not to report this siting, since it was only a light.   But, decided to report it in the hopes that someone else will also confirm this sighting.<n>

We live in a very rural area, with no city lights to obstruct the night sky view and it was perfectly clear this evening so every star seemed visible.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As soon as we pulled out of our driveway and headed south we saw 4-5 VERY bright lights in a row at about 45 degrees up from the horizon in the south western night sky.  We noticed them at the same time and simultaneously we said to each other &#34;What the h--- is that?&#34;<n> <n><n> <n><n> The lights were in a row and glowing very brightly, probably 5x the brightness of the brightest planet/star in the sky.  They were so bright that we thought at first someone was shooting off fireworks somehwere south of us.  But it only took a second to realize that these lights were standing still, in a row.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We stopped the truck and got out to see better as soon as we saw them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Suddenly they began to move slowly to the west in this manner: the light to the far left end  of the row of lights would fade completely out and a new light would appear to the right end of the line and then the last one on the left would fade, then a new one appear to the right end of the line.  It kind of snaked its way along like that for about a minute.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then, we saw three more lights of equal brightness forming what appeared to be a large triangle formation around the first group of lights, but at a distance.  These lights glowed brightly, then dimmed completely out, then glowed brightly again, then dimmed completely out.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After about 4 repetitions, all the lights diappeared, then the sky in the area they had been in was filled with random sparkles of light, much smaller then the first lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After about another 30 seconds we saw a single bright light identical to the first ones more to the south and higher in the sky.  It got very bright then dimmed completely out probably 3 times before disappearing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then we spotted another one, this time in the west, about 70 degrees up from the horizon.  Same bright light, exact same intensity, same glowing and dimming pattern.  After about three reps it, too, faded completely out and we saw more of the small sparkles.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first I thought &#39;meteor shower&#39; but meteors don&#39;t come in in lines, nor fade and glow over and over, do they?  The last set of sparkles took on a pattern, like: 3 blinks, no blinks, 3 blinks, no blinks, and moved in a very randam, almost haphazard pattern.  It was too weird.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This all took place in about a five minute time span.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We got back in the truck, going on and on to each other about how cool and weird that was.  We headed east toward town and I spotted another light, exact same brilliance, to the southwest again, same dimming and glowing pattern, then disappearing.  And again, after it disappeared, there were two sparkly lights, doing the 3x blink pattern.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have never seen anything like this before, and would welcome any sensible explanation!<n> <n><n> <n><n> We saw several airplane lights in the sky at the same time, as we alwasy do at night, but they were obviously just that, airplanes, blinking, moving slowly across the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> These things were NOT airplanes.<n>

It also changed color several times as we watched.  It ranged from orange, red, blue, and green. The brightness of the light also varied during the time we watched.  It was always the brightest object ib the sky, but it seemed to periodically change in brightness, often emitting different colors of light in different directions.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As we watched we noticed an abundance of aircraft from the nearby naval base flying towards or in the area.<n>

The first time I noticed it was Saturday, October 23. I thought it was a star, but after observing it a long time, I knew that it was too bright, too big, and too close to the earth to be a star.  It did not move.  At that time, we had a full moon.  I noticed as the moon changed location, this object did not.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It appears every night at the same location and sometimes moves very slowly and other times stays stationary.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Last night, I got the best look of it of all.  I even had my neighbor come out and look at it with me. This object was very very close to us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As we watched, two other objects appeared and the larger one began to flash red lights as the two smaller ones seems to come closer to the larger one.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I live at XXXX Drive, Arlington, Texas 76018. From my tracking, the object appears first at 7:30 p.m. on the left side of my house and moves to the right side of my house as 10:00 p.m. approaches.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I even called the airport to see if the government was conducting some sort of aircraft exercise.  They knew nothing of such tests.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with this witness via telephone, and she seemed quite sincere in her belief that she had witnessed something unusual.  However, based on he description above, we believe that she probably was observing the planet Mars.

We thought it was unusual to have 3 airplanes that close together, especially since we don&#39;t see many planes here in northern MN.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They were headed in a westerly direction.  One of the lights eventually veered SW and then we heard the sound of it&#39;s jet engines so we knew it was indeed an airplane.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The other two blinking lights continued to travel west, making no sound, and then suddenly one of them took a 90 degree turn, which surprised us because airplanes can&#39;t turn that quickly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It turned again and continued to travel in a NW direction with the other blinking light.  We followed their course in the sky for about 10 minutes when suddenly it looked as if they connected to each other and 4 GIANT beams of light shone down from the craft.  It was almost too bright to look at but you could definitely tell there were 4 lights.  It illuminated a very large area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This lasted for about 5 minutes and then just disappeared.  No more blinking lights at all.<n>

The lights seemed to be straight across from each other, maybe a hundred feet apart or so.  They may have been about 4 stories up.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is a very small town in southern Indiana and I have never seen lights this bright and this low.  My first instinct was that an airplane was about to crash into our little town.  But after I got past the houses and trees, I didn&#39;t see anything anymore.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then as I drove a little further down the highway I saw a very bright orange light.  It was at about a 45 degree angle from my car about 2 or 3 times higher than a light or cell tower.  It seemed to come on for about 4 seconds then it disappeared and I didn&#39;t see anything after that.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The distance between the two occurences was about 1.5 miles.  I had just left my house and was heading to a business meeting in the next town.<n>

The first night we witnessed the same object approximately at 7:00pm while trick or treating with my wife, my neighbor’s wife and our children. All three of us witnessed the object traveling in the same direction height etc. I witnessed the object again on 11/1/05 around same time and on the third evening I was outside and it appeared again. I ran to my truck and got my Nikon D70 digital camera and quickly tried to focus it on the object, while resting the camera on the hood of my truck to steady the camera. The camera had trouble auto-focusing and I switched the auto mode to sports, and was able to get three pictures, 2 of the object and the third of nothing many seconds later. I have the RAW – NEFF pictures for anyone who wants to analyze them, however you will need Nikon Capture 4 software to view the images. My neighbor wants nothing to do with this, nor does my wife. An unknown man near to us during the Halloween sighting on 10/31/05, exclaimed, “It is a UFO!,” but we don’t know who he was, he was not from our neighborhood. After I did a radio interview on Coast to Coast, a Suffolk man contacted me and described seeing the objects again three nights in a row. This is not the first time I have seen orbs traveling in this direction (roughly South to North) a friend and I practically chased one in the daytime in the fall of 2000. I have since learned how to set the parameters on my camera and will be ready the next time to hopefully get better pictures. I have been told that digital pictures are not as reliable as film photos, but still a pretty good amount of detail and authenticity should be able to be gleaned from these two photos by those who know what they are doing, since I have no background or experience in this type of research.

It was moving from West to East.  After looking at it for a few seconds I realized it was something unusual. I ran in my house and grabbed my binoculars and now was standing on my back porch. As the object came over my house and back into view I looked at it through the binoculars and I could see only a perfectly round white object. It had no blinking aviation lights and was moving extremely slow like it was gliding or floating. I heard absolutely no noise for as a plane at that height of which I estimate to be between 4,000 and 10,000 feet I would have heard. The light did not change in hue or intensity no matter what angle on the horizon the object moved. The shade of white also did not resemble a plane&#39;s lights. As if flew over my house and was now 30 degrees in the sky and flying away from me, the light started to fade, not turn off but get dimmer and dimmer (in a cloudless clear sky) and then disappeared with no other lights visible. What was strange was 3 things. First there was only one bright perfectly round white light with no other aviation lights, 2./It moved extremely slow at the level it was at-It seemed that it was moving so slow that a plane couldn&#39;t have flew that slow and finally 3./there was absolutely no noise at the altitude it was at. I had realized within about 2 seconds that this was not a plane. As to what it was, I don&#39;t know just that it was unusual. And it is good to know that there are still things in life that can make you wonder.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Sighting of International Space Station.

The lights were so vivid and close but I could not see the shape of the object only say the lights associated with it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I pulled the car over to get a better look, me and my four year old daughter were in ahh just looking at the lights as they danced in the sky.  I was trying to make sense of the what we were looking at thinking maybe it was a kite with lights on it, but it was moving to fast and covered so much distance and there was no fluttering noises like kites make.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then I thought maybe it was a remote control airplane, but there were no engine sounds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When the object would descend and climb it would strobe 4-6 lights in front of it and when it would spiral it would only have 2 red lights at the tips of the craft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My daughter and I watched the lights/object in the sky for about five minutes till it disappeared.  Then I picked up my son a few minutes later at kids club and started telling him what we saw and where in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then my son spotted the lights in the sky and so we watched the lights in the sky while in the car driving east on Chapman Avenue we stopped at the red waiting to make a left (north) on Knott avenue, that&#39;s when we noticed the second craft in the sky with the same exact characteristics as the first one and we watched the two(2) objects flying in the sky flashing their lights and spiralling in all directions.<n> <n><n> <n><n> That&#39;s when the signal light turned green and I raced down the street to pick up my wife from work and I got to her worked I parked in front and honked like a mad man telling her to hurry and get in the car so I can show her the lights in the sky so I raced around the office buildings to the back where there was a clear view of the sky but when we parked we only saw one of the objects about 3-5 miles south east but she was able to see the objects lights and its extraordinary maneuvering capabilities.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We watched the objects for approximately 2-3 minutes till we lost sight of it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The whole sequence lasted about 30 minutes from 5:30 pm till 6 pm.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Please note, it was already dark outside since we had turned the clocks back on Sun. 10/30/05.<n>

I think of this constantly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was having dinner at a Restaurant located in Woodstock, Georgia on 92 Highway with my wife and stepson. After dinner we walked out to my vehicle when my stepson (age 9 at the time) pointed skyward directly above us and asked me what that &#34;thing&#34; was. I looked up, as did my wife, and saw a large craft directly above us flying at a low altitude. It was moving east along Highway 92. It was not making a sound and was in a perfect black triangle with orb type lights on each angle of the triangle. It was moving very slow. It was heavy overcast that evening and it moved in and out of the clouds. We watched it until it left view. I had no idea what it was, my reaction was one of puzzlement and did not feel in fear of it. I initially thought it was a government craft since a major AFB was nearby.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When we got home, my wife looked up information about it on the internet and it was the same craft that has been sighted in Belgium and Phoenix, AZ. After the interview with MUFON, I was given information that what I had seen was not a government craft. After explaining it&#39;s size in relation to my hand at arm&#39;s length, I was told it was a mile long. I was also told that someone else reported the same thing and the other person was across 92 HWY in a parking lot.<n> <n><n> <n><n> have not experienced any sort of trauma as a result of this experience. The MUFON investigator said it was still possible.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))<n>

She was pointing up at the eastern sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Four to five exceedingly bright lights were rapidly moving back and fourth against the sky&#39;s dark background.  We had never seen anything like this before.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The star-like objects were &#39;proforming&#39; as it were, a correografic dance in the sky, so it seemed to me, as they swooped at impossible speeds towards one another, then at angles, speed away again.  Some also seem to briefly hover in space before converging repeatedly in circles around one another.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Amazingly, my eyes were drawn to moving lights that I could see through the leafless branches of a nearby tree ajacent to the group I was looking at.  There were at least five more doing the same manuevers in that part of the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This phenomina lasted for about minute or less before the objects shot away from veiw in all directions.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I would estimate the objects to have been several kilometers from our observation location.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am a retired ((deleted)) teacher, 6X years old.

My name is ((name deleted)). I&#39;m a ((deleted)) driver from Polegate.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had just woken up this morning at about 7am and got out of bed.  I went over to the window and peered over to my next door neighbours garden as I frequently do and I saw a very odd shadow on the grass.  I could not see what cast it but it was hovering, spherical and moving across.  There was an odd humming sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Despite my best efforts I could not see the object fully above as it was directly over my house.  I did howver manager to make out a grey rum of whatever it was.  It was a durable looking material that must have been metal although seemed to be different to what I&#39;ve seen before.  It&#39;s hard to describe but it seemed a cross between metal, plastic and foam.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was extremly low and probably about the size of a small car.  It was definitely hovering at what I&#39;d say was about 20 ft above my house roof.<n> <n><n> <n><n> One of the things I remember most was an odd irritating heat sensation that seemed to come over me like a hot flush.  Being inside in a cool envirnonment meant that whatever it was wasnt affecting the temperature of the environment but just my body.  It was I&#39;m afraid to say quite frightening for myself.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I called up my son ((name deleted))&#39; to come and try to see the object and he looked out of his window which is at the front of the house.  He, too, saw the shadow and recognised that it was a hovering craft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I dashed over to the phone and tried to call a neighbour that lives near us to see if he could see the obkject as he could view it as it wasnt directly above his house but as I did the object seemed to rise and the shadow with it.  The humming dissapeared and the hot sensation left.  This craft had a helicopter movement, even better than that but was far too small and quiet for it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I haven&#39;t a clue what it was or what it was doing and I&#39;d much appreciate your help.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Best Wishes.<n>

I noticed a bright light about 10 to 20 miles ahead about 30 degrees above;  It was at least 1-2mm (perspective) from my viewing distance.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object was bright as Venus and about twice the size of Jupiter.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first I thought it was a helicoptor but the object did not move.  Also of note was that the object did not waver like a bright star would do as seen at night; the light was steady and bright, brighter than an airliner or helicopter would emit.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I got closer about 5 miles from the object (Loop 1604E and Highway 281 North) it started to disappear or vanish from the sky.  The object did not move away it just vanished.  At this time I was at stop light while it disappeared.

The duration of the sighting lasted about 2 minutes.  It was only after I left the area to catch my bus in order to get to work on time, (of all things!), that I realized it must have moved quite drastically from its original position as for the last 30 seconds or so of the sighting my neck was craned upward quite a bit and the object turned into a much smaller orange light basically round or ovoid in shape<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Source indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

Then another red light came towards it in the same path it had just gone. When they came within what looked like inches apart with the naked eye, they both moved along slowly together. I couldn&#39;t believe what I was seeing. I wanted to keep watching but had to move on to my other salons. It was only a 5 minute drive from where I was. I continued working, when I came outside later on I looked up to see three lights in a triangular formation moving across the sky. I can’t quite remember if each light looked like the same red star, or if it was possibly white lights of planes chasing what I’d seen. It was so long ago I can’t remember exactly. I just know it was an experience I’ll never forget. I’ve never seen anything like it since.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.

11/1/05 23:00|Jamestown|RI|Light|2-3 minutes|Lights in the november sky|11/8/05|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/047/S47420.html|448|ndxe200511| Lights in the november sky<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was about an hour before midnight on an unseasonably warm November first.  I was with my friend on a beach enjoying the clear sky.  The water was calm, the air cool and the stars shining.  We both witnessed a shooting star.  At first it was blue and after it broke up some, it turned green then finally vanished leaving a gray trail.  I saw a red shooting star that my friend unfortunately did not get to see.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was sitting on the beach facing east and turned my head to face north-northeast.  I first saw a flash of light, like a fat short lighting bolt with even sides.  The end of the flash bent to my left slightly, then disappeared.  What appeared then I can describe as a small dot of light.  It was an orange-yellow color and it just stayed in the same place motionless.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After a moment it started to move to my left.  At first I figured it was a helicopter, but it soon made a manuver I haven&#39;t seen a helicopter make (aviation has been a hobby of mine all my life).  It went down at a 45 degree angle to the right for a moment, then stopped.  It glowed different colors after it stopped, from yellow to orange, then the light suddenly disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We both watched in amazement of what we had just witnessed.  After no more then 10 seconds the light reappeared in the same position.  This time it was shifting from red, yellow to orange (in no particular order).  The light then moved to the left, and then in front of it several different colored lights appeared.  I would say there were 3 green lights and one yellow/white light.  The formation of lights slightly resembled an airplane, but pretty soon the lights were changing formation.<n> <n><n> <n><n> More yellow/white lights appeared and the green lights went into a triangular formation.  As the lights moved to the right, my vision of them was obstructed by trees.  As the last light was just about to vanish by the trees, it violently changed colors from red to yellow/white.  The rate it was flashing was like a strobe light.  It then was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The objects were only round dots, like the period at the end of this sentence.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Me and my friend are both 18 years old and male.  We were only star gazing looking at constellations on a beautiful night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A few minutes after witnessing this my friend became irrationaly afraid of a noise in the bushes behind us.  It was just a deer and nothing to be afraid of, and he knew it; but he still wanted to leave the beach.  I told him to calm down and to give me a cigarette.  I layed down on the beach trying to make sense of what happened.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Halfway through the cigarette I sensed an overwhelming sense of dread and panic, basically my brain demanded that I leave the beach.  I told this to my friend and he agreed wholeheartedly.  We walked back to my house and didn&#39;t talk much of what we saw, we mainly focused on the shooting star we both saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n> For some reason we both try to deny what we saw.  We told our friends but the memory is a burden, it feels like something only crazy people would talk about.  We both tried to agree to not mention it again.<n>

It was a clear night, but we soon were driving through what was to be guessed as a fog bank.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After rolling down the windows we soon discovered the fog was actually wood smoke.  After exitting the smoke later down the road a small glowing cone shaped object was seen innthe rearview mirror following us down the road.  It soon disappeared my view, as it was to close to the rear of the vehicle.  When it was out of my view the car backfired, and I saw sparks in the rearview passenger mirror, as if the object had hit the ground and rolled on the asphault.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Later down the road coming to a bridge, four figures were crossing the road towards the west.  Unbelievable, but I swear as we passed they were greys, in the middle of the winter and naked.  Ten minutes later, about one hundred feet out from the vehicle a red ball was following us.  Staying the same rate as us, and the same altitude as us, as we were heading up Thompson pass.  Nothing out of the ordinary until we got to the top of the pass.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then I saw what looked what to be a giant pyramid hovering over Valdez.  It had three lights, one on each corner.  After we got through the pass and into the canyon before Valdez, I lost sight of the triangular shape in the sky.   Once we got through the canyon and close to Valdez, I noticed the object was gone.  Before getting onto the ferry we noticed Alyeska pipeline response vehicles driving all over the city of Valdez.<n>
