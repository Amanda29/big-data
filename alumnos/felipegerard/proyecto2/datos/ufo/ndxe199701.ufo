I witnessed this UFO when I was leaving work to drive home.  It was travelling in straight lines, forming a triangular pattern, approximate airspeed was about 150 MPH as far as I could tell.  I had the impression that it was of the type described by Bob Lazar, UUP/element 115propulsion. After approximately 5 minutes,the UFO sped away to the north.  I believe that I was in some kind of mental contact with the occupants of the craft at the time,as the triangular course seemed to circle directly around me also. I am currentlyworking on some sketches of the craft, bu tI thought it important to report the event as soon as possible.  I will email the sketches in JPEG format as soon as they are complete.Perhaps they were interested in this location because it is in proximity to several of our National Guard military installations.<n>

It was the color of the stars or planets. I thought it was a train coming towards us at first, But it was traveling the same direction we were traveling so this was no train. The light was about at the same level as our vehicles. It traveled at about the same speed we were going and continued along with us for about five to seven miles.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After it disappeared, I called to my wife on the CB radio and said, &#34;Did you see that?&#34; She replied, &#34;I thought it was just me.&#34; I said, &#34;No, I was watching it too.&#34;  We continued on to Barstow, California and stayed there for the night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Still to this day, we have no idea of what the object was.<n>

My father whom has been famously a non-believer his whole adult life, has recounted to me a truly disturbing story.  Although it was a couple years ago, I finally decided to report his story. My father works for a local steel company, he would leave for the day shift at approximately 0545H every day.  He took the same route every day. Since we live out side of the city he would travel a back country road off the highway.  When he turned onto this road he noticed up ahead that it appeared to be the sun rising beyond the bush area.  He travelled closer, approximately a mile up the road, over a railroad bypass.  When reaching the max height of the bypass he saw what a large saucer type object to his left.  It was about half a kilometre from him.  He pulled over to the side of the road and observed it.  It hovered above the trees.  Predominately red lights with blue and white also.  They did not flicker but were continueous.  He told me that it was about 200 feet long in length and approximately 50-80 feet in height.  He remarked to me about how he couldn&#39;t believe how big it was.  It was noiseless and there was no other actions other than the ones stated above.  He observed for about  half an hour.  The reason he knows this, he told me, was because he pulled into work at 5 minutes to 0700H.  He left before it did, so it is unknown how long it stayed. He didn&#39;t tell me at first, he relayed the story to my mother, whom told me.  I questioned him right away.  He has refused to speak to anyone about it for fear of ridicule.  He is afraid of being called &#34;crazy&#34;.  He did not speak of it for a couple years, self-doubt was obviously taking its toll on him.  A week ago I asked him about it again and he gave me more detail, with vigor.  Unbeknownst to him I am relaying to you his story. I am my fathers judge of character.  This is a man that doesn&#39;t cheat on his tax returns, obeys all rules and is strictly honest.  I have always believed in the possibility of UFO&#39;s.  Now I KNOW there is UFO&#39;s.  I have no doubts of this.<n>

A telescope revealed a round shape.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I observed what I took to be a satellite, until it shifted direction, and then stopped.  It was slightly brighter than the brightest stars in the sky, and not an unusual color.  It would hover for awhile, then move, sometimes appearing to spin in circles.  I first looked at my watch at 19:11, after having watched the object for perhaps 10 minutes.The object hovered in basically the same part of the sky for over three hours, at times appearing to drift, and then bring itself back to where it was before.  It often just hovered perfectly still, and looked like a star. It was roughly overhead of Alta, very high, a little  to the northeast.  Witnesses who saw it move included a member of the Alta Fire Department, a dispatcher for the Alta Marshall&#39;s office,And two members of the astronomical society at the Hansen Planetarium in Salt Lake.  They happened to have a nice 3inch wide telescope, and were photographing the moon.  With a higher powered eyepiece, the telescope showed the object to be pefectly round, with a darker round circle in the center.  I think the telescope was about 12000x, if I recall correctly.  The object was absolutely still in the telescope.I think the image in the telescope was consistent with looking up at the underside of a perfectly round flying saucer.  No lights were apparent on the object.  It appeared to be reflecting light from the sun which gave it the appearance of a star to the naked eye. Conceivably, this was some type of satellite being put into a fixed orbit, except for the erratic motion.  With my arm outstretched, it moved the length of my thumb, at the most.  I would like more information on types of satellites.  Personnel at the Hansen Planetarium weren&#39;t aware of any satellites that can behave like that.  I am a former Assistant Chief of the Alta Fire Department.<n>

The strange part: it was being followed by a small helicopter w/ brite flashing red light, which made usual HELI. sound. The triangle,which looked more like a huge manta-ray, w/ short triangular tail, emitted no sound/was 2-ft.ball fields wide/moving at maybe 20mph, the heli. 1/2 mile behind it.

Oklahoma a bright object came from the north about 30 degrees above the eastern horizon moving rather slow. It was breaking up into several small pieces in about 15-20 pieces and burning a bright blue and white. It continued across the sky until invisable into the south. The surrounding light was hindering a good view of the object shape.I am a amature star gazer and I have seen the space shuttle reenter at night and a Russian booster rocket reenter (about 8 years ago). This object was about the same speed.I have been in the U.S. Air Force for 4 years stated at Altus AFB Ok.Local and national news has yet to say what that object might have been.<n>

It hovered for at least 10 minutes, then it faded quickly into black.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At approximately 7:15 p.m. on the evening of January 21, 1997, I was driving toward my home in Blackwell, OK, when I glanced in the sky.  In the west/southwest sky, somewhere between 9-10 oclock I would estimate, I spotted an object.  Thinking it was a star at first, I looked back at the road.  Then, thinking to myself that it looked larger than a star, I looked again.  I couldn&#39;t get a really good look at it while I was driving, so I stopped in a church parking lot to watch it.  The object was larger than a star or planet.  I watched the object for just under 5 minutes, in which time it did not move.  It was a golden colored object with a red &#34;tail&#34; hanging to the left.  The red light at the end of the tail occasionally appeared to be flickering.  I went to my parents&#39; home and they both went outside.  Both viewed the object.  We do not believe that it was a helicopter, due to the fact that the lights were large enough that if it were, we would have heard the noise.  We heard no noise at all.  My mother and I returned to the house to gather a few things and get in the car to drive away from the town and view the object.  However, when we went back outside, the object was gone.  Another witness we spoke with said she was watching as it disappeared, and it just faded into black, as if it were traveling away from her at a high rate of speed.  It did not appear to move from that position, so if it was moving, it would have had to have moved away at the same angle that we were viewing it from.  It did not just disappear all of a sudden, it was very bright (brighter and a little larger than the average star)and then began to get smaller and fade into black.  We proceeded to drive into the country and we never got sight of the object again.  We have not gone public with this story, but we would like to know what it was.  If it has a simple explanation, we would love to know!<n>

It moved along a ridge of a mountain before it suddenly disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A friend and I were driving from Phoenix to Las Vegas (I believe that the number of the highway is 93). We passed through Kingman, Az and a little later, around 10 pm, I noticed a light moving to our right. I brought it to my friends attention and we watched a single object come out of the east, travelling west over the ridge of a small mountain. There was only one object. It was small and luminous, but not very bright. It looked about three times the size of a regular star. I would have considered it to be a conventional aircraft, had it not been for the way it moved. It was extremely fast. It came in, slowed down somewhat, and then accelerated. Also, its path was a little erratic, not very smooth. After about only five seconds I lost sight of it. It could have disappeared behind the ridge, but to me it looked like it simply vanished. My friend and I are both senior psychology students at Arizona State University. My friend is extremely skeptic with regard to UFOs, but we both agree that it wasn&#39;t an airplane, a helicopter, or a satelite.<n>

I shot down very fast. We saw it for about 2 seconds. As soon as I was about to say something we saw four lights to the east of us. We were going North. The lights were diagonal flashing in a domino affect. The lights were a bright fire looking color like the color of a lighter flam. They danced in the sky in the same pattern for about a minute it. The length of the lights given the distance from the sky looked about 40 to 50 yards long. The lights disapeard with no fading or dimering just disapeared. Like I said the light show only lasted for 1 min. I don&#39;t know if the green triangular shape was the same thing we say from the east of us or if they were two different objects. The date should be right because I wrote it down the same day it happend.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Roberto Cavazos said. &#34;It wasn&#39;t high, it was low. It was going very fast. It looked like a fireball with a tail. It was very, very clear. It was not a falling star or anything like that.&#34;retired rancer, Francis Zuehl said, &#34;The object was like a ball of fire with a tail. It started on my right, heading to my left, south to north... ...It wasn&#39;t high up in the sky, it was low. It wasn&#39;t going down, it was going crossways, and it was much faster than an airplane.&#34;The 3-foot round, 60-pound sphere was found half-buried on Jan. 24 by rancher Ed Longcope. It was on the cover of the San Antonio Express-News. The Air Force confiscated it but later agreed to return it. Walter Andrus Jr., who heads the MUFON in Seguin, examined the sphere shortly after it was brought to the Guadalupe County Sheriff&#39;s department. He believes it is a fuel pod from a satellite. He said he knows of only one other such object recovered, because anything re-entering the atmosphere generally burns up. He speculated this one could have survived re-entry intact if it came in at an angle.The Express-News has many photographs<n>

It was hard to tell exact distance and size, since it was dark. (honestly, I&#39;m not very good at judging distance.  But I can tell you that this was very close!) The area is elevated and hilly. But my best guess, is it wasn&#39;t higher than 20 feet above the road we were traveling on.  It was stationary, and did not move.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I don&#39;t know the exact name of the area, but it is just east of Ellensburg, WA. We viewed this for such a short time, (maybe 40 sec.)

The brightness of it from a distance seemed to be a circular glow, but as we drove closer it seemed to come to a bit of a point at the bottom of it.  But maybe it seemed that way because it was dripping whatever it was...?<n> <n><n> <n><n> Sorry I can&#39;t offer more info.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I admire your research.

I&#39;d see 4 lights (not sure of size or shape), high in altitude forming a square. On all of the nights i&#39;d see them (this was third night), planes and helicopters would be flying around too, they&#39;d fly up to a craft and quickly turn and fly away. The crafts themselves made no noise and had white and light greenish-blue lights. On this particular night, the last sighting i had of them, they showed up around 6 pm EST and were there till about 8 pm EST. At approximately 8 pm, a small triangular craft flew right over the roof of my house. The roof is about 30 feet high, plus there is a chimney adding about another 10 feet, the craft just grazed it. It flew relatively slowly from the back of the house forward (heading north) and turned up and disappeared as soon as it cleared the roof. It was only about 15 feet from the nose to rear, if that, and had slightly rounded edges. It made no noise and the entire bottom was covered in small, irregularly sized and shaped lights in the same white and light greenish-blue of the other crafts. Their placement and shapes reminded me of a mosaic. I didn&#39;t see the top or sides of the craft. After the triangular craft flew over, the 4 crafts in the square formation were gone as well.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

It was almost like a light bulb . It stood motionless and made no sound. Right about the time that wee all started yelling for attention it flew away back the way it came.

I was in this stereo store while my son was outside talking to some of the people that worked there. (My son was about 19 or 20 yrs of age at this time.) He had called me out to look at what was in the sky to the East, sure enough they were flying saucers!  All of us were amazed!!. Other people from the shops there saw us outside looking up in the sky so they came out also and looked above and saw the samething. Wish I had a camera! These flying saucers where flying in and out of the clouds, staying for like a few seconds and fly out like they were taking turns. They must have been doing this for maybe a good 5 or 10 mins. They were silver and not quite cigar shape, but pretty close to it, but with a dome ontop. That day was a clear day, blue, but white clouds scattered. We don&#39;t get many clear days like that here, so it must have been either after it rained, (cause that&#39;s the way our days will look after it&#39;s rained) or a day after we&#39;ve had our Santa Ana winds kick up. So, it sure wasn&#39;t smoggy that day.  Anyway, thought I&#39;d share our experience. It&#39;ll be one that I can always share with someone and say I witnessed an opportunity that many will not have.

Read your email and I didn&#39;t think I&#39;d have the receipt for the car stereo, but I found it. It doesn&#39;t say what time of day of that sighting that we all saw, but it does give a date which was Jan. 15, 1997. The city I thought we were in was not Paramount, it was Pico Rivera which is next-door<n> <n><n> to that city. I was having my stereo installed in my car that day, my son bought the stereo for me for Christmas. Also, it was before 5 PM cause I remember calling the TV stations after I got home and it was almost dark.   From Pico Rivera it takes me about 30 - 45 mins to come home depending on<n> <n><n> traffic and there were no other stops I remember I made coming home and this was not in the morning and this happened before dark, but after 12 PM.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I did submit to your site on this experience prior to receiving your email and not looking for this receipt, however one correction: It was not in Paramount as I wrote on this form. I will write your tel# down if I ever happen to view a sighting again. Thank You for that!  Thanks for emailing me.

I was taking my husband to work.  It was on a road with little traffic during the day and none at that time of the morning.  There were areas of dense trees on either side of the roadway and large high tension electrical poles on one side of the road.  There was absolutely no traffic at that time of the morning.  As we rounded the bend to go into the main entrance to his worksite, we spotted an object that resembled a chandelier with many tiny white lights.  The moment I said, &#34;What the hell is that?&#34; the lights instantly turned red.  At that point it moved away from the electrical pole and slowly glided or drifted away.  I wanted to observe it further but my husband was in a rush to get to work on time.  After I dropped him off and went back out I tried to see if it was still there, but it wasn&#39;t.  It was definitely intelligently controlled, but did not feel threatened by it.  I was amazed and exhiliated.  It appeared to be approximately 25-30 feet in total diameter, in an oval or round shape with protrusions with white lights on it.  It was quite dramatic and beautiful.  I believe this object was a &#34;probe&#34; of some type.  As we approached it appeared to be absorbing power from the tension line.  We have never officially reported this to authorities for fear of ridicule, but have shared with some family members.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

Great speed, seen from 1/4 mile away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I don&#39;t recall what day, or exactly what year, however it occurred in January. Whatever the year was, it was the year of comet Hyukutaki, and the date of the occurance was the night that the comet was to be most visible, for our area and weather.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was driving home from work that evening, and in casual observance I was looking to see if I could spot the comet; not realizing that the comet was to be seen in the eastern night sky, and I was travelling west on hwy. 60. As I rounded the corner by Crysteel Manufacturing, I saw a luminescent sphere the color of silver, appear from the northern horizon proceeding to the southern horizon and disappering in the distance. At first sight I thought it was the comet, yet in a split second I realized that it was something else. As I wathced; this object flew &#34;nap of the earth&#34;, as it crossed over the expressway it appeared to be 100&#39; above the ground, and was about the size of a quarter in perspective from my distance to it.(1/4 mile). As it continued its flight south, it crossed over a grove of cottonwood, just grazing the tops and silohueting the branches as it passed each succesive grove of trees. The length of time that I observed this was about 6 maybe 7 seconds, and the distance that it travelled from one horizon to the other is about 6+ miles.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Naturally I was in disbeleif of what I saw, even though I knew I saw &#34;something&#34;, when about 3 seconds later the second object dropped out of the sky in a very steep angle, as if it had been waiting for the other, and proceeded in the same direction, but with greater speed; the bottom of the second object was at the same tree top height above the ground. This second object was a sphere as well, only of greater magnitude, about football field in diameter. The color of the second sphere was this amazingly emerald green.<n> <n><n> <n><n> To this day, I am still amused by the fact that I saw these two objects that were purposefully flying towards some objective, and that they definetly were not some natural phenomenom that were just ambling throught the air!  I also cannot get over how pristine and intense the colors of these objects were; that the colors were not necesarily a surface coloration, but rather a luminuous glow emminating from a reflective metalic surface, like the color you get from anodized metal.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We believe the comet was visible in the spring of 1997.  We have amended the date above.  PD))<n>

We went to this path by our house.  It had a slope on it and it was a nice spot for kids to go sledding.  My neighbor and I were doing just that when all of a sudden I look up and see what I thought was a comet.  I said to my friend, &#34;Hey look!  Check out that comet!&#34;  We both look at it for a few seconds.  Then he notices another similar &#34;comet&#34; to the north of the one I saw.  My first reaction was, &#34;Maybe this is a meteor shower,&#34; but I soon realised if this was a meteor shower why weren&#39;t the meteors visually moving.  I looked back at the UFO I spotted and saw that it had moved further up (it was on an angle like this \ from our viewpoint) and the tail had grown.  Then one of us saw a third UFO in the distance which was about 1/2 inch long at arm&#39;s length ( the first was about 1 1/2 inch and the second 1 inch ) I can&#39;t recall exactly what happened because we were both so excited, but #2 had grown and moved, too.  Eventually the third one moved and a fourth appeared.  Let me remind you that I didn&#39;t see any of these moving, growing, or appearing.  This kept on happening, one would move and grow while another would appear.  After about a half an hour there were nine UFOs and by this time #1 had grown to about 4 or 5 inches and had moved so it almost vertical ( they were moving in a circular pattern with one appearing when it was horizontal and increasing in angle from there ) as the others had grown proportionatly.  By this time we were both freaked out.  So we ran the half block home thinking aliens were going to abduct us knowing only what the media had told us about UFOs and aliens.  After that I became very interested in the UFO phnomenon and read countless books on the subject.  My neighbor however, I think has pretty much brushed it off as somthing explainable, but I checked and there was no comet or meteor shower that night.<n>

They were flying at an altitude normally too low for conventional aircraft.  Too slow for an airplane. . .almost as if they were gliding.  They made no sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On the evening of January 12, 1997 around 11 pm I was at my girlfriend&#39;s house and went outside to try to start her car (it had been very cold that week and we had been trying to start it for a couple of days).  I went inside the car, tried to turn it on and it didn&#39;t start.  I got out of the car and two bright lights hovering over a set of trees caught my attention.  I knew that there were no lights (city or otherwise) that should have been there so I looked at them for a second or two.  They were really bright but at the same time kind of dull (hard to describe).  I moved a few steps away from the car and they started to move in a northeasterly direction.  When I first spotted the lights they were probably 1/4 to 1/2 a mile away.  I ran inside and told my girlfriend to come out and check them out.  She got on her boots and saw them but went back inside because it was at least 10 degrees below zero outside.  I ran out onto the street and followed their flight path.  They fl!ew from a southwest to northeast direction and were probably 60-70 degrees off of the horizon.  The two lights upon closer inspection appeared to be made up of more than one light, possibly five. . .occasionally they would blink (they blinked quickly, unlike any other airplane light I have ever seen)  The thing that struck me the most is how they stayed _perfect_ formation. . .not straying an inch from their formation.  It was as almost they were part of the same craft.  This might be the case, but if this is so that means that this craft was at least the size of 2 football fields.  They were completely silent.  Billings is set against a continuous series of cliffs which are about 60-100 feet in height.  In comparison to the Rims (as they are called) they were about 200 feet off of the ground.  They were flying too slow for any airplane that I know  of (plus, as i said they made no sound)  It was if they were gliding.  I ran up a side street and watched them pass over the rims!and pass just south of the airport, if not right over it.  I watched them glide off until they went over the horizon.  It was very strange, as the entire time I knew this was something that I have never seen before in person.  I tried to call the airport to confirm any unidentified aircraft but couldnt get through.  If there are any questions please email me.  I can positively state this was not any conventioal airplane.<n>

I was driving east on Peters Colony Rd. in Carrollton, Tx.  My wife and I saw the craft in front of us over the city of Plano.  I dropped her off at home and got my camera, then continued to follow it east on Frankford Rd.  Another driver in a truck next to my lane was also looking at it through his windshield.  It was moving south, so I turned on Kelly Rd. (southbound) to follow.  On several occasions, I considered stopping to photograph it, but could not find a good spot.  I thought it might be a blimp, but it did not change shape as it made turns.  I had to turn again, to the west, on Trinity Mills Rd. as it moved to the west.  When I finally found a place to stop to photograph it, it was out over the D/FW airport.  I was in a resturant parking lot, where a construction crew was working that night.  The Josey Ranch house was across the street from me.  I took 7 photos (4 zoomed out, 3 zoomed in with a 210 mm lens).  I showed the photos to my best friends father who was a flight controller at Lovefield Airport in Dallas and, he could not identify the object.  About six months later (after he was transfered to D/FW Airport), he told me that another flight controller was talking with him on break and he described the same object that I had photographed.  I provided one of my photographs and the flight controller did agree that it was the same object.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was moving quickly through the sky.. duration from immediate happenchance view directly overhead to passing out of sight approx 10 - 15 seconds. This thing did not mean to be seen! Completely by chance I looked up and saw it. The night sky had just enough illumination to be able to see this large dark object. The site area was approx 3 miles from downtown Columbus. I have never seen anything like this in my 42 years of age and it has taken me 10 years to report it ( I was 32 at the time)... I am a professional businessman and father of two children, college-educated and very scientific-minded but skeptical of possibilities of likely Ets in this universe being able to travel light year distances to be here but I am convinced this was not a craft from this world.

Suddenly this object appeared coming from behind me above tree level heading in a SE direction relatively horizontal. It was very clear and bright (a whitish sort of metallic light). There was no haze or bluriness at all. The object was circular with very clear edges. It appeared to have either a raised middle section or a lighted area around the center. It was travelling at tremendous speed and was out of sight in just a couple of seconds. At first I thought it was a reflection but there are no street lights in the area and it was going too fast. It definitely was not an airplane nor a shooting star. It was too sharp and clear for a shooting star and too round for an airplane. Besides, it was going too fast for a plane, even a jet. I have worked at the University of Connecticut since 1961 and have never seen anything like this on any of the roads I travel to get to and from wor!k which is 28 miles from home. I have seen another strange sighting at home in Moosup, CT 06354. I was outside one night with my dog. While she was doing her business, I was looking at the stars. Suddenly a light appeared just like a light bulb had been turned on and darted across the sky. It was quite a while ago, maybe a couple of years, so I don&#39;t remember exactly which way it was going after it &#34;lit up.&#34; I think it went from NW to SE at a rapid rate and was out of sight in just a few seconds, probably five or six.<n>

I saw that something like a vortex came from the stars and I could see what appeared to be the stars and everything around it like a drop of water bouncing off more water, it looked like a chandelier.  I was so amazed. I have always had so much respect for the intergalactic and the planet Mars.  And I know so much about these things.  I love the Universe and it amazes me this happened to me.

This one looked to be the same as the other. We quickly sped away in the car to his house about 500 meters away. When we got out of the car the first one was still directly above us as if it backed up to follow us. The object made no sound at all, even though it was so low to the ground.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was dark out. It was in a residential area so there were houses and trees around. The object was rather large (bigger than any plane around here) We saw two of them, one was REALLY close the other was about 100 meters behind the other. Both of them were hovering. They were both dark in color, either black or gray. The &#34;spotlights&#34; were very bright.<n>

Also was sent to Unsealed Alien Files.  Interestingly no one has ever contacted me about it except for a few non-scientific fanatics.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The photo was taken in Hawaii, on the island of Oahu in the town of Haleiwa. The date was sometime in January 1997.  It&#39;s been a while.  I am a long time professional photographer (surfing and stock) who has been in the business for over 40 years.  One evening, after watching a movie with a friend, and they were leaving my home, they pointed out some strange lights in the sky, it was late about 1 am.  I decided, what the heck, never shot a UFO foto, and got out my big surfing lens (a Nikon 800mm f/5.6 and added a 2x tele-extender and used a very heavy duty tripod) and took about 10-20 photos.  The film was Fuji Velvia 35mm transparency, exposure was about f/8-f/11 for about 15 seconds.  It was very clear that night, no clouds or haze at all. I have my own film processor so I pushed processed the film to a speed of about ISO or ASA 200+.  I got two really good photos, this is a slide duplicate and digitized file of one of them. The bright light is not the moon.  It was shot looking s! outhwest from the north ground position, roughly far above the center of Oahu.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As far as I could tell (its really hard shooting the sky at night) the objects were at least a mile or two up in the atmosphere (from previous experience shooting aircraft with the same setup during the day), I would say the objects were about as big as a 747?  There were blinking multi-colored lights on their perimeters, and you could clearly see the outline of the craft thru the lens.  This was the second series of photos over about a 1/2 hour period.  The first series revealed only one object, triangular shaped, with pastel lights on each tip (maybe the Aurora?).  During the second series of exposures about 20 minutes later there appeared to be two &#39;craft&#39; and that is the photo I submitted.  There appeared to be a super bright beam that connected the two craft for about a minute.  Please be aware that the film was grainy and because it was &#39;pushed&#39; (the only way I could get a decent exposure), and super dark night. Its really tough to shoot this kind of thing at night and get anything at all.  As a professional there wasn&#39;t much else I could do to get the best exposure under the conditions.  I didn&#39;t want to shoot too slow because of shutter vibration, wind etc, and this was a very long, very heavy lens.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At this point I will have to tell you that I thought about calling the local news, but I am a fairly private person and didn&#39;t want the publicity.  I was able to call Art Bell&#39;s show several weeks later when I think he was interviewing Peter Davenport (my memory is a little foggy) but I remember Art or Dave mentioning that I could contact a fellow who Art had mentioned was a ufologist named Mark Bean in Nevada.  Apparently he had some high quality equipment and said he could enhance the photos.  I made some copies of the originals with a &#39;slide duplicator&#39; and it ended up being a good decision because I mailed him (Mark) the two best &#39;originals&#39; with the intent that he would scan them and return the originals.  I never heard from him again, and sent the photos with delivery confirmation, but there was no record from the Post Office that they were ever delivered!  A mystery!  I tried contacting Mark a few times, never got any replies, and gave up.  I just wonder if he ever got them!?  It was a perfect typical &#39;Murphy&#39;s law&#39; situation.  I was just glad I had made duplicates.  I&#39;ve been sitting on the &#39;dupes&#39; for over 10 years.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The one I submitted to Coast to Coast was from a duplicate that I took to Costco last year and had scanned to a fairly large digital file (about 4 mb). That&#39;s the one I sent digitally to the show. Please be aware when you make a duplicate of a dark photo like this you really lose a lot of the original quality in the second generation exposure, and then again when scanning the image.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have the &#39;triangular view of the single craft&#39; duplicate in my files and can look for it again. If someone could spend some time on these with photoshop and very high quality equipment they could probably get a better enhanced image or maybe recreate an artist&#39;s conception of what these objects looked like.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;ve been a techno geek in photography for over 30 years and still can&#39;t figure out exactly what I photographed, as I have shot other time exposures in darkness and have my work published in national photography magazines.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Please note: There are so many small details, and opinions I have that it would take a few pages to give my theory and opinions what these objects are. I always wanted to shoot a UFO, (doesn&#39;t everyone?).

The next|4/2/99|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/005/S05962.html|43|ndxe199701| I awoke in a to a ball of white light in my hotel room in Long Beach, the object came towards me and I ran into the bathroom. The next day in the SeaTac airport I saw a strange skinned blond man looking at me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was two years ago when I had my first private contact with biengs who I believe are very likely extraterestrials. It happened during a time in which I was descovering non-religious spirituality as a new way of thinking and living.  I was eighteen years old at the time.  The event took place while I was sleeping in a hotel room in Long Beach during winter break.  At approx. 3:00a.m. I felt something or someone awaken me. I awoke to see a brilliant white ball of light floating anD &#34;dancing&#34; outside the room balcony sliding door. It was about the size of a large grapefruit and moved through the closed sliding glass door. It came into the room and I had a strange intuitive feeling that this lightwas here to see me.  It moved towards the second bed and then to my  bed which was farthest from the balcony.  It came right up near my face (approx. 5inches away)as I sat in bed. I was not afraid but was worried that it might harm me so I ran to the bathroom and shut the door.  I stayed in there for about 20 min. and then I returned to bed and the light was already gone.The next day when my father and I returned home to Seattle in the evening I had another strange encounter at Sea-Tac airport. As I walked off the plane down the hall to the baggage claim ther is a mural on one of the walls of magicians doing magic tricks.  I had a strange feeling that someone was standing there waiting for me, so I looked at the several people standing against this wall.  I saw a young white male dressed in army fatigues who had unusually clear and radiant skin.  My initial reaction was that he was a manequin because his  skin looked like that of a porcelaine doll or plastic-like. He looked to be in his twenties and had non-U.S. fatigues. He was a bit over six feet tall maybe 6&#39;3&#34;.  He was waering a green beret and he had reddish-blond hair.  He had a very pleasent expression on his face, he looked happy as he looked at the blank wall across from him and then at me. Another thing he was doing was standing in the &#34;at ease&#34; position! .  I stopped for a short time to look at him. He stood in this position the entire timeand I left so that I would not get lost finding my father who was ahead of me.  I wondered if I should have went up to him but I wasn&#39;t sure so I didn&#39;t.  The thing that stuck me about him was his serene, happy expression. Usually total strangers do not behave in such a way and do not stand totally still with good posture. A few months later I happened to hear of a woman in Australia who had encountered blondish aliens dressed in army fatigues.  I also heard of another case in which a woman had telepathic communications with a blond alien who visited her in the form of a ball of light while she was in a hotel room during a U.F.O convention. Finding this out after the encounter made me think that this person might have been an alien.  Since then I have often felt that I am in telepathic comunication with some beings.  I notice that the more focused on spirituality I become the more these things happen to me. Recently on March 13, 1999 Iawoke to another ball of light in my bed room.  It was a bit bigger than the other one and it chenged colors from, white to lavender, to orange, to green, to yellow. It left my room through the window after about 15min.  Also when I am afraid to fly I feel as if someone takes all of the fear away and I know it is not me doing it. Unfortunately I do not have any photographs or video as I was unable to get to a camera of some kind. However, I could draw pictures of the events.<n>

I witness a small (star-sized) orange light travel roughly east to west(top to bottom of eyepiece) in about 3/4 of a second.  I immediately looked at that area with my naked eye, as did my husband, but we saw nothing.  Approximately 10 minutes later,my husband was viewing M42 with a 15-mm eyepiece.  He, too, witnesses a small &#34;yellow-orange&#34; light, traveling at the same apparent speed - although he describes its movement as &#34;erratic&#34;.Again, our attempts at immediate naked-eye confirmation yield nothing.  We continue to observe M42 in the hopes that we will see another light.  This time, we alternate: oneviews through the scope while the other observes M42 with the naked eye - at this point, we have ruled out satellites (&#34;erratic&#34; movement of the second light) and insects flying in front of our lens(none observed with naked eye - lights are in focus through scope - lights are visually quite small).  Approximately 10-15 minutes later (19:45), my husband is viewing through the scope,and I&#39;m watching Orion like a hawk.  With my naked eye, I witness a white light, again visually star-sized, &#34;come out&#34; of the bottom star of Orion&#39;s sword, travel in a small curve or hook, and then travel at a visualangle of about 45 degrees.  It moves in a straight line until it is approximately under the right star of the belt, and it simply &#34;turns off&#34;.  This takes about 2 seconds.The previous night, my brother and his friend were over observing M42 and Betelgeuse (19:00) and reported seeing &#34;shooting stars&#34; through the telescope.  My husband and I are amateurastronomers, and have seen meteors, satellites, airplanes - all of the &#34;reasonable&#34; explanations.  These three lights do not fit in with those explanations.  We have attempted over the past few months to figure this out, but cannot.  I can only say that we both have had an unshakably strange feeling about these observations, and I decided that posting this sighting might bring other observers of this phenomenon to us.<n>

It was about 11pm.  I was sitting on a rock in the middle of a clearing watching the sky and saw 4 lights.  If they had been motionless they would not have been detected because they looked exactly like just another group of stars.  They formed a perfect box shape at first. They moved exactly together.  Making squares, diagonals, all sorts of movements in all directions and most of the time staying in this box formation, but varying it a little. I watched this for about ten minutes, same thing over and over. They were very clearly there.  Then all at once they stopped and about a half a second later, they broke formation and all spun out in weird spiraling ways in the opposite direction until they were gone out of sight which only took about another half a second.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Matter of fact there were 3 of them together. One short, one medium and one that was taller than the two. They looked in on me and ducked out of sight as I looked to see them. Just out of sight. I never got up to even investigate. I knew they were only spirits. Yet much like the aliens we see on TV. So a night or two of visits and I just prayed and rolled over as I might if a demon or something was around. I knew faith was my only protection. Then the taller one on the third night came in my room just before time to sleep. I rolled over but watched him as he came around the end of the bed. He took the image of a device or sensor and stuck it in my knee. My body went paralyzed for a brief. Like an epidural shot. So I just waited until I felt ok. No real problem since he left right after that. Never opening any doors just appeared in my place. The next night the little on came up to t! he side of the bed nearest to my head and I could see him but like always knew he was in spirit form so I’d never be able to touch him or defend myself besides faith. He got up kind of close, about a foot, if even that much from me and said the word”THC”. I smoked right much marijuana back then so it wasn’t a surprise to hear the reference. Then he said a word I’d never heard before “Transduced”. I had a dictionary in the drawer by the bed. I looked in it right away for the meaning. Low and behold it means “by supernatural means” to travel in spirit to another place is to transduce yourself. I knew that I had really seen Aliens in my home. Then years later I had a bone spur in my heel. I worked at a temp service and was working extra hours on a good paying job. I had put in overtime and 12 hours that day even. My heel was hurting on the cement floors all day. Another alien came into my sight. In spirit and said he was send from God. He asked me if I wanted him to make it go! away. I just thought back to him. I think telepathically the ! answer “ yes” and a glow of light came from his head toward my heel. I felt it warm a brief. The pain ended, and I never felt it again. I did go get the spur removed as normal but never felt any pain to mention from it from that day on. A little on jokes with me all the time in the spirit realm which I see in both realms, gifted I suppose. He says he is from God sent to watch over me.  I think angels come in different forms. I believe I saw God even in person the same way. Once as an old man and another time as a big greenish grayish blackish supernatural being I think. Maybe even in flesh somewhere in space. He projects himself having instant Daffodils and honey bees, dipped in olive oil or with white wine sprinkled over the flowers as one of his favorite things to eat. Said he had only revealed himself to three men that in any way of the sort.  They were Rafael on a boat, Moses and then me the as the third, if you count me twice. Then it’s four. I lived in Israel 2000 yrs. ago. I w! as told by 3 psycic people that I was Messiah. I am supposed to reveal myself 2012. God hasn’t affirmed it. I just know Antichrist will rise and you won’t be able to put money in a drink machine and get it to work. God will give him that kind of power as best I have seen it. Then after brutalizing me as a young man and losing my friends and family, finally come looking for my resolve of his rein. Kill him and war it out before he gets more powerful. 40 days of war has been prophecied. I pray for you all. The number will be in telepathic form sent out for all who will receive. Your answer in your heart and mind already you see. Like a bad acid trip. Spirit romping it all down for the devils last stand.<n>

The small lights roughly the size of a small magnitude star were bouncing around on the horizon.  Shortly thereafter we observed 5 bright lights flying over us in a V-Shape.  They were identical to that of the Phoenix lights which were videotaped in March of 1997.  The V-Shape lights flew from the southeast to the northwest towards Las Vegas.  There was absolutely no sound from the object.  After the incident I telephoned Sky Harbor Airport who referred me to Luke Air Force Base who in turn referred me to Peter Davenport of the UFO reporting center in Washington state.  We only gave my aunt&#39;s name to Mr. Davenport.  I was quite shocked to learn of the March 1997 sightings again.  I decided to again report this when I heard Mr. Davenport on KFI radio and called in to the radio station.  They put me on the air but did not further question me.  I was left hanging.  This sighting, two months prior to the sighting of the Phoenix lights needs to be brought forward.  My Aunt&#39;s name appeared on a television show as one of the people who witnessed the Phoenix lights.  Her name is ((name deleted)).<n> <n><n> <n><n> My uncle who also witnessed the sighting is an engineer as is my cousin who was also a witness.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  This individual hear me discussing the Phoenix Lights sighting on a radio program (Lee Klein/KFI-AM, Los Angeles, 12OC02) and called in during the program.

It was oval, but more  rounded on top. It hovered very high in the same spot for about 3 or 4 hours. We would go in the house and watch tv and come out hours later and it was still there. It was very high up and after some years passed, I kind of dismissed it. Then, about ten years later I was walking with my three year old son in a park in a neighboring city and saw the exact same thing, only this time the craft was much lower in altitude and there were three of them. These craft were moving slowly across the sky. They were exactly the same  as the original ten years prior. Two of them were close and a third was farther away from the other two. The single one seemed to be leading the other two. They were all the same. Silvery, almost looked like a drop of mercury if you broke open a thermometer. Rounded edges, not like a saucer but more like a mushroom top. Only smooth and sheeny. They reflected alot of light like a mirror or highly polished aluminum or chrome. These sightings were ten years apart and exactly the same kind of craft. They were silent and seemed to produce no exhaust of any kind. Both sightings were in broad daylight and of sound and sober composition on my behalf.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

One of the witnesses reported that the objects had 4 lights each on the bottom of the craft, in a + formation. Object itself was not seen, but from the light formation, we are assuming the craft is triangular or airplane shaped. After 2-3 minutes of just sitting there, each object took off at tremendous speeds into a different direction(ex. object 1 came from the North, shot into the East, object 2 came from the South, shot into the West). The witness I spoke to mentioned that he couldn&#39;t remember any sound, but wasn&#39;t for sure. I am an independent Ufologist, and this report came to me from a co-worker who saw these objects with their brother. From the description he gave me, I first considered the possibility that these were convential aircraft, maybe refueling or performing some kind of training. However, the objects he described seem to fit the description of an airplane maybe, but after he told me that they became stationary, I&#39;d never heard of any airplane performing such a feet in mid air, at least not 100 + ft. above the ground. I&#39;m not convinced that these craft were extraterrestrial, but they don&#39;t have the characteristics of being anything I&#39;ve ever seen or read about that could be military or experimental.<n>
