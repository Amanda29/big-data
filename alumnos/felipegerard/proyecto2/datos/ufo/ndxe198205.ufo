5/28/82 18:00|Stewart State Park|OR|Formation|2-3 minutes|Glowing, colored, 3 object, light formation, merging into one bright ball of white light, and then disappearing.|6/12/07|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/056/S56844.html|1|ndxe198205| Glowing, colored, 3 object, light formation, merging into one bright ball of white light, and then disappearing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was nearing dusk on the beginning Friday evening of the Memorial Day holiday week-end, in approximately 1982.  I do not recall the exact date, and it could even have been 1983?  Myself, my wife and three children were camped at Stewart State Park on Lost Creek Lake in Jackson County, Oregon, with another family, a co-worker, his wife and their four children.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We had had a very full day and were all just sitting around chatting after eating dinner. I remember being very tired at the the time and feeling myself in an odd state of lethergy, when I noticed a roughly pyramidal-shaped formation of three glowing objects silently moving down the highway bordering the edge of the campground, moving over the edge of the campground itself, and moving roughly parallel to the highway.<n> <n><n> <n><n> From where we were camped I could see pretty much the entire expanse of the campground area and quite a bit of the lake beyond, at its edge, and a portion of the highway and the bridge across the lake, at its far edge. At that time you could see this, but now the view has has changed considerably due to the growth of the trees that have been planted around the park, that were then basically just seedlings. Now, you cannot see across the campground very easily and depending on where you are camped, you cannot even see the lake, itself.<n> <n><n> <n><n> But at that time I could see the other campsites across the park, I could see the smoke from their campfires, see people and I could even hear their voices. I could not hear exact words, but I could hear laughter and voices.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I remember feeling amazed that what I could clearly see had not caused the slightest spark of interest from any of the other campsites. And, I can recall being amazed at my own strange lack of excitement. I just sat there in somewhat of a &#34;funk&#34; and calmly said: &#34;Gosh, look at that.&#34;  My youngest son, who was approx. 12 at the time, was sitting next to me, and he said to me: &#34;Yeah, gee....that&#39;s funny.&#34; Also, in a very calm voice, and showing no hint of excitement, either.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A third person, the wife of my co-worker friend that we were camped with, who was sitting directly across the picnic table from myself and my, also acknowledged that she had seen it, too. But also in the same sort of matter-of-fact manner saying: &#34;oh yeah,&#34; very off-handedly, then she laughed continued chatting with the others in the party, who had seen nothing at all.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After many years, I discussed with my son what I had seen and asked him what he had seen. His recollections are far less vivid than my own. He cannot recall EXACTLY what it was that he saw, only that it certainly was something out of the ordinary. He too, remarked how he felt the same, in an odd sort of lethergy and the odd feeling of calm with a complete lack of excitement.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I also discussed the sighting very briefly with my friends wife, again many years after the incident. Her response was that she definitely saw something but couldn&#39;t begin to explain what it was, then laughed it off and she changed the subject, like she didn&#39;t care to discuss it. It was almost as though we were all drugged or had been zapped by something (though nothing of the sort had actually happened!).<n> <n><n> <n><n> My exact recollections of the sighting are this: The three balls of light were perfectly round and had to be at least as large as an automobile in size, judging from how far off they were from our campsite. One was red, one was green, and one was white. I remember at the time saying to myself that they looked like Christmas Tree ornaments, they had that same sort of glowing quality about them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They were solid objects and you could not see through them, and they were each surrounded by a sort of a whitish colored halo....you could see through the halo itself, in a sort of out of focus fashion. The halo was surrounding each of the objects seperately, but not collectively around the formation itself. The objects couldn&#39;t have been more than say 30 or 40 feet, at the most, from each other.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The were no windows or appendages on them of any kind....no markings at all, and they moved in complete silence, emitting no trail behind them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I watched them veer slightly from the highway edge of the campground and glide directly over the campground itself, and then out over the lake....going quite a distance over the lake before, in what felt like just seconds (or less), the three balls of light merged together, changed color to a very bright white, and then shot straight up into the sky, going extremely fast, and totally disappearing from sight. Again, not making the slightest sound, but leaving a very discernable white streak behind them, which just as quickly as it had formed, faded and then disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Oddly, I put the entire incident out of my mind, and did not even mention it to anyone in the group for the rest of that week-end, nor did my son or my friends wife mention it at all. I did not report what I had saw to anyone and it actually took me quite some time to later come to the conclusion that what I had seen was very possibly a UFO. Whatever it was, it was not imagined. It definitely was like nothing I had ever seen before in my life (I was approx. 42 or 43 at that time).<n> <n><n> <n><n> Does this sound at all like something that someone else has reported?  Now, many years later, when I tell this to others (friends and family), they all think I&#39;m pulling their leg about it, or they jokingly accuse me of being a &#34;bit swacked&#34; at that time.  It is not a joke....I did see SOMETHING, and I was not drinking at the time, either.  There was not a single drop of alcohol in either of our campsites, as my friend and co-worker was a recovery alcoholic and was, at that time, very early into his now 25+ year association with A.A., and I did not want to make him feel uncomfortable that week-end by drinking in front of him.<n> <n><n> <n><n> If you feel that this report has any merit or deserves further communication, please feel free to contact me.<n>
5/20/82 20:00|Cheshire|CT|Unknown|20 minutes|A sighting of the Hudson Valley UFO|11/26/03|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/033/S33042.html|2|ndxe198205| A sighting of the Hudson Valley UFO<n> <n><n> <n><n> I know this is old news.  I&#39;ve been reading about the Hudson Valley sightings and was excited to read that there are many similarities to what I saw, and I&#39;m certain that what I saw is consistent with those events.  Here goes:  I&#39;m really not sure of the date, but on the evening of the sighting, I was at the opposite end of my house, which was a duplex, sneaking a smoke with my 2 brothers.  I remember looking at the sky and saying out loud how cool it would be to see a UFO.  Suddenly, my mother called for me and said that I had a telephone call.  It was my friend from up the street.  He wanted to borrow an audio cassette of my brother&#39;s, and asked if I could bring it to his house.  He lived in the third house up the street from us, to the east.  As I walked to his house by myself, I looked up to my left (North) and saw a formation of lights heading Southeast.  There was no sound coming from the lights, so I figured this was something to keep an eye on.  I ran to my friend&#39;s house and told him he needed to come outside and see what was going on.  We walked further up the street to the east and just past the next intersection where we could see that the lights had stopped directly over the local recreation area&#39;s pond.  There was no noise, and no movement.  I can&#39;t recall whether the lights were blinking or not.  As we were observing the object, a smaller object of white light came over us from the original direction of the larger object (North to South) and seemed to fly up into the center of the lights, where it disappeared.  After a few minutes, the object started moving to the Southeast.  The recreationarea also has a big sledding hill, over which the object eventually disappeared out of sight.  We were pretty excited about the whole incident.  I went home and told my mother and brothers what I had seen, and on the local 11 o&#39;clock news, a report about it claimed it was a bunch of private pilots out of the Stormville, NY airport flying in formation as a practical joke.  Knowing that airplanes don&#39;t hover and do make noise, I can say with 100% certainty that we were not watching private airplanes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Again, I know this was a longtime ago, but I noticed in the articles on the ufoevidence.org wesite there aren&#39;t any mentions of anything being sighted in my area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

It looked like energy pure...<n> <n><n> <n><n> Realy I&#39;m not sure as to the correct date, but my brothe and I were sleeping down stairs at our home in Kansas. We were awoke late at night. The tree&#39;s were old and bent to the ground. (cotton woods) At least a 100 years old and as big as 4-5 feet in diamiter. I felt this, I don&#39;t know..Presence. The wind was blowing eradicaly. I was scared, but I had to see. I thought a tornado at first, but my yard was the only one afected. We were sleeping in the second living room with a big picture glass window that had no coverings. It was dark, I stood up, went to the window and as I looked I saw a bright light bounceing from house to house from at least two bloks away. In my front yard we have a flag pole that my grandfather placed for my uncle who was killed in WWII. the light seemed to grab ahold of the pole but slowly came to the windowsil. My brother was screaming at it to go away, but I could barely hear him. It was a magnificent bright light. It was full of depth and clarity, but distorted. I felt like something had me in it&#39;s grip but yet I felt whole. I think it scaned me! I never could remember how I felt until I was older. What broke my affixation on the object was our Mom. I don&#39;t know how long it had been, but Her yelling at us to shut up was what made the thing go away. I t bounced as it went, I could only see it till it went a half a block, and burst into nothingness. A blinding nothingness. My brother to this day I haven&#39;t spoke to about this phenomenon. My Mom&#39;s to old to remember,...ordid it steal her memory of what happend? I don&#39;t know? All i know is that it happend. My mother was yelling at us to shut-up, and when she came out to close the sliding glass doors I was standing in front of the window,scared and all she could do is say: You kids need to go to sleep It looks like a storm is comming and if it&#39;s bad you need to get your sleep.  The weirdest thing about the light was when my Mom came out of her room the tree&#39;s stood back up. I could be crazy,but I&#39;m not.  I get chills! just remembering!!!!!<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>
5/18/82 14:00|Marin|CA|Disk|20 t0 30 secs|high speed objects over the ocean North of San Francisco|4/25/02|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/022/S22476.html|4|ndxe198205| high speed objects over the ocean North of San Francisco<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was on a feild trip with my fifth grade class at a place called Fort Ross North of San Francisco.  Two of my freinds and I observed 2 disc shaped objects ping ponging around the sky above the pacific ocean.  Upon first sight of the objects I thought they were shooting stars, because of the shear rate of speed.  But as soon as they started bouncing around, foward, reverse, left, right we new we were veiwing something none of us had ever seen before.  While in flight they seemed to make hard angle turns as if from one point to another in any direction.  I guesed they may have been as far as 100 miles out to sea at times.<n> <n><n> <n><n> And maybe up to 6000 feet elevation all the way down to 500 feet in as little as a secound.  They cleared a set of coastal mountains that looked to be quite far away to the left of our horizon but then were instantaniously back centered over our feild of vision.  I guesed the experience lasted close to 20 to 30 secounds because my freinds and I had time to look at one another and ask each other if we were all seeing the same thing, which was confirmed.  At the time of the sighting I had a sense of feeling priveleged to be seeing what we were seeing.  My other freind shared a similiar feeling.  The kid stsnding to the right of me was terrified and refused to go camping the following weekend with his family.  The discs did have some sort of running lights, they circled the disc none seemed to stay a consistent color changing from red,green,yellow,white, and maybe blue every couple of secounds.  This event took place 20 years ago but is still crystal clear in my memory.  We were all in 5th grade not to young and not to old, we all new what we had seen. I know I saw a UFO that night to this day.  Years later I ran into my Freind Jeff with whom I veiwed the UFO with.  I just had to bring the incident back up, it had been 16 years since I had even seen him, he recalled the experience just as I had remembered it.  My guese is the ufos were either silver or a silver white it was dark but I could see the running lights reflecting off the craft.  They didn&#39;t appear to be to big maybe the width of a 10 person leer jet.  The ufos were silent from where we stood....<n> <n><n> <n><n> 20 years ago, but it doesn’t<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

No aircraft or noises after that.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Sitting at home in the evening, when a loud boom shook the house.  Maybe a sonic boom.  Not sure.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Ran outside with the curiosity of anyone my age (12) to see what had just happened.  Upon arriving outside, I saw a perfect&#34;cookie cutter&#34; round hole in the cloud cover.  The full moon was in the center of it.  The hole was HUGE!  The full moon was dwarfed by the circle in the clouds.  It is almost like something was there in the clouds and vacated immediately.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Didn&#39;t see any aircraft of any kind.  No lights or engine sounds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I then noticed I was holding my pellet gun for protection and was also being watched by the  neighbors.  I felt out of place and went back inside.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I would very much appreciate any kind of response to this.  I feel like it was very important.  But I have just found some one to tell that can&#39;t really tell me that I am a nut, if you understand.  Did any one elsereport anything similar anywhere near thattime?   Could be one year off either side.  Could it maybe be explained as a natural phenomenon?   Either way, I would just like to rid myself of the curiosity of the whole event.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.  PD))<n>

When i was nearabout one theater on the road i saw one circular object (around 90 mm dia.) up in the sky at the center of the road. The object seemed to be at the height of about 100 storied building. The object was illuminated ( same as tubelight). When i saw it it started moving towards front-left dirction off the road in parabolic trgectory. Within 10 secs. it vanished behind one building. I was aware that the building next to this building was demonished by muncipal corporation and that is why i started running expecting that i can still see this object through the gap. but i did not had to run much and by the time i reached to my class place the object once again came on the road (front-towards the center of the road again in parabolic tragectory). When it reached at the center of the road, i thought of showing this object to 3/4 boys near my class. But the light in the object suddenly went off exactly when i thought of doing so. I had to practically take down my hand which i had raised for tapping one of the boy. very fast response. i fell that the object was able to sense my mind.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

I had return to Detroit, MI from living in TX for 6 months.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Me and my sister were standing at a bus stop on Jefferson street near a park that sit’s in the middle of the Detroit river called Bel Island.  When a craft appeared to come from over near or from the river moving in a quick type of motion towards us we both were looking in the direction of it and stop our conversation and just were speechless. We both looked as if how is it that all of this traffic is moving and no one else seems to see this but us?  It moved so quickly we were lost for words until it left. It actually hovered over us as to observe. There was no sound. It had to be the length of a small home. It only stayed over us maybe 5 to 10 min and than left with the same sharp motion going straight than upwards so very fast. Well we than said very little until later we spoke on it. Here it is year’s later and I still think about it today.  There is no way that we are the only life, I know for myself and so does my sister. I would take any test given.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))<n>

He had rented a small home near Woods Reservoir Lake part of the Arnold Engineering Development Center Air Force Base.  My drive home is on a highway that cuts through the Air Force Base-it is all trees for several miles.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I reached the highway I noticed a red/orange glowing oval shaped object that hovered to my left as I drove and seemed to go with me.  Occasionally it would cross my path and dip in front of my car and quickly go back to the left and hover.  At first I thought I was seeing the reflection of my cigarette in the window and so I put out the cigarette and the object was still there.  It continued to hover and dip in front of me many times during the 15 minute drive.  As I reached the edge of town there is a large curve in the road and as I made the left turn on the curve the object flew above (instead of dipping in front of) my car, crossed over and to the right and disappeared over the trees to my right.  It was reddish orange, oval shaped and seemed to be brighter on either side of the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

Mother ship ascended in altitude and release one of the probes and then lost visual.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I know this is an 18 year old report but it still is vivid to me as when it occured. It was a mild spring evening when I was with my friend as she prpared to return home. Looking out her window I was studying the starfield when one of the stars did &#34;not look right&#34;. She thought I was pulling her leg so I went on to the back poch to investigate. After observing the object for ten minutes, two probes came out from the tree line on the horizon. The probes were bright glowing red and ascended effortlessly to the main ship. At this time I called the Erie aIRPORT AND spoke with the controller and told him what I was watching as I was watching it. He thanked me and three of us continued to watch this as it occurred. The probes entered the craft and the craft seemed to grow brighter and ascended slightly. A red probe was emitted and then the lights disappeared. whole sighting lasted 25 minutes. Air traffic control did not answer return calls and nothing in local papers after incident. I am recalling the incident from memory but do have documentation on file. I am ex-Navy with all sea duty so in my opinion, the sighting I have described here appears authentic since I have no other reson to believe otherwise. Good hunting!<n>

While playing we noticed low flying Air Force planes in the area. Since my brother was in the Air Force I could tell by the markings on the wings, and that&#39;s truely how low they were flying. A few minutes later one of my friends and I walked a block down the street to my house. As we were hanging at the end of my driveway we watched several bright lights coming toward us from the sky heading from the Watchung Mountains. It appeared that the Jets were passing by again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As they got closer and over head we realized they had surrounded a large round saucer like craft. The only way I can describe it is as a big metalic waffle iron. The bottom was glowing orange with blue sparks or flashes here and there.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We both just stood there amazed and speechless.

Knowing by now my memory of the event will not be totally accurate I have not wished to report it. However, the memory of something very out of the ordinary remains and particular parts of the memory remain clearly as if it only happened yesterday. I remember even to this day what I was doing just before the event and I remember my dog had been with me at the time that I was sitting outside my house in my yard. I don&#39;t remember seeing the object come closer to me, so that I can&#39;t verify that for its been too long. However, I remember seeing the object either a little higher or a little lower than the telephone line than runs through my backyard and wasn&#39;t more than 150 yards in distance from where I had been sitting when I remember seeing it. This object was a classic saucer shape. It still seems like it just suddenly appeared and I remember being unsure of what it was I was seeing. My parents didn&#39;t allow me to see scary movies, in fact I had no idea what a &#34;UFO&#34; was until I picked up a book in the school library at 6 or 7 years old, recognizing the picture on the front -- suddenly realizing I had seen that same thing. I remember the object hovering over the yard in the far corner, and the noise I heard is what I remember the most...a drowning repetitive sound that never changed in pitch. The moment I felt fear struck me when this object unknown to me at the time to what it could possibly be, overtook me when the lights from the object fell to the ground, like a spotlight. I can&#39;t say for sure what colors they were except that I believe it was possibly 3 colors, either red, white, and green, or red white, and blue. I&#39;m not even sure anymore how those colors actually formed on the ground other than it formed a circle below the object. My instinct even at that young of age took over, and I ran (luckily my door wasn&#39;t very far from where I had been sitting) straight into the house with my dog ! right be hind me. My Mom recounts the incident, still remembering me coming inside screaming and saying there was something in the sky. She says my dog was very upset and spooked, and acted like she was nervous. When my Mom went to look outside to see what I could have been possibly talking about, it had disappeared without a trace. My Mom also says she remembers me mentioning the noise and she questioned me, asking if it was a helicopter. I told her no, and described the noise to her. She remembers me walking out in the yard to show her where I had seen it -- in approximately the corner of my yard. For many years now I have tried to tell myself that if I saw anything it had to be something the military made. However I have never gotten over that feeling of complete fear when those lights hit the ground...as if whatever was in that object, knew I was there. I am a student of psychology, I know that the mind recreates memories, however there are three things I know I couldn&#39;t have make up -- the fear I felt -- that sound I heard and the fact it hovered without any wobbling. Recently, I have begun to accept my memory of the event and have done some research and that is why now I can share it with someone who might find the report useful in some way. I&#39;m not afraid that someone might think I was crazy, because I pondered the thought myself for many years and truthfully at one time I preferred that thought over the thought of it really being something unknown.<n>

Neighbors also saw it. I reported it to the police, but nothing cam of that.  After all these years I decided I want to let the sighting be known for whatever good it might do in the search for the truth.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was living on Normandy Drive, Pisactaay, N.J., at the time.  It was 8pm and at that time of year the sun is low in the western sky, but the sky is still bright and clear.  I usually went out back at this time to watch the sunset.  My yard ended at railroad tracks and power lines that went east to west.  Across a field on the opposite side I had a clear view of the distant Watchung Mountains in the northwest direction from my yard.  It was a cloudless clear sky.  I was facing due west.  The sun had just gone behind the mountains so it did not obstruct my vision.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After a while I noticed a small oblect in the sky coming from the west to east, not far from and paralleling the power lines.  It was coming directly towards me.  I thought nothing of it at first.  As it got closer I noticed it had an odd shape.  At first I thought it was a hot air baloon.  But, as it came closer and grew larger, I could see that it was in the classic shape of a flying saucer.  It came almost directly  overhead and it had to be at least 100 ft. in diameter or larger.  When it was nearly overhead, aboout 350 yards at its closest point to me, it made a 90 degree turn and went north gaining in altitude as it went.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I ran to get my neighbors.  Four of them came out and saw the saucer, but only after it had gained some altitude and distance so they did not see it nearly as close up as I did.  They were none the less amazed at what they saw because even when they saw it, it was plain to see that it was no known conventional aircraft.  There was a small local airport not too far away and my house was under major flyways for the N.Y. and Newark City area airports.  Usually at any given time you can go out and look up and see various normal aircraft or j! et trail s in the sky.  On this occasion, the sky was oddly empty except for one small private plane coming from from the direction (west) of the local small airport.  The small plane came to a distance of about half way between me and the departing UFO.  Even at these distances the UFO could be seen to be well over twice the size of the plane.  The plane looked like it was a two or four seater.  The plane suddenly made a 180 degree curved turn about and flew back in the direction of the airport.  I thought that was a strange maneuver.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We watched the UFO until it faded from sight into the distance.  At no time did we hear any noticable sounds at all coming from the UFO.  I told other neighbors later on, naturally, they thought I was crazy.  My neighbors who saw the flying saucer with me would not talk to any one but me about it.  To this day I regret that I didn&#39;t get any photos of the UFO, for that would have made it easier for meto tell this story, if I had photos to show as back up.  But that doesn&#39;t mean others in the general area didn&#39;t see the UFO as well.  So, someone may have photos of the incident after all.  I owuld like to know if anyone else has reported this sighting in May 1982.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD))<n>

Thick forest was on both sides of the autobahn restricting my view to the east and west.  It was a sunny, clear day.  Suddenly I saw a large, silver cylinder object streaked across the autobahn down the road ahead of me, going east.  It seemed to skim the tree tops.  There was no sound at all:  Nothing like an approaching aircraft, helicopter, etc.  This siting happened very quickly because of the incredible speed the UFO crossed the autobahn.  I did not see any wings, nose, or windows, and did not think it was an airplane then or now, especially because of the speed and the fact that it was flying so low.  I immediately asked my ex-husband if he saw the object, but he was either looking another way or dozing, I cannot rememember.  He certainly did not hear anything.  It occurred to me the UFO could be a Pershing II missile test launch, but it was far to large and the Pershing IIs in West Germany at that time were black.  I did not report this siting to anyone, but I know what I saw and it was very odd.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thank you.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>
