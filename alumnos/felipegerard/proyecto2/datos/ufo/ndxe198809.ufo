I was in my early teens. I remember that it was suppose to be the closest Mars was to Earth in some time and after doing some research, I learned that it was the perhelion of Mars on 28SEP88. I do not remember if that was the exact date we went out, but it would have been close to that time within a day or two. The news channel in Madison had announced it and that is why I knew about it, so I am guessing it was the actual date.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We went out around between 1900-2200, I don&#39;t remember, but it was night and a chilly fall night. We set up the telescope facing the western sky and I do remember Mars was about half way up the night sky. We took turns looking. While my dad was looking through the scope, I turned around facing east and saw a small circular orange light traveling from north to south. It was way off in the distance and I remember thinking it was moving faster than a normal airplane, but not impossible. I was very curious and thinking it had to be an airplane of some sort. I waited to see the blinking lights. Instead, after a short while, the object made what seemed like a perfect 90 degree turn upward and zoomed out of sight in an instant leaving a streaking effect that lasted just as short of time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

As someone who is an extremely keen aviation enthusiast, i am familiar with heights, shapes dimensions, speed etc....<n> <n><n> <n><n> Anyhow what i saw was an object that was a perfect circle, it had approximately 6-8 segments and was a bright silver, i stood and watched it for at least 5-6 seconds and then i could see it no more. I believe that the object was approximately at 60000 ft and probably 200ft in width. It was static and not moving.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My companion asked what i was staring at and i explained a silver disk..<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have never dispelled the fact that it could have been a weather balloon but i couldnt understand why its appearance was suddenly gone. Ever since that late British Summer i have always been interested in UFO siteings. With regards to my eyesight i do not wear glasses and 14 years later i still have a perfect eyesight and am compelled to scour the skies in both daylight and night time, as i know things are out there.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date may be approximate.

This window is located in my upstairs den. My house is located along a flight path, so I often see planes landing and taking off. I often track them with binoculars and watch the spectacular sunsets and military jets that are routinely streaking across the sky. My kids and I were on our way to dinner so I took a quick look with my binoculars out the window at a cloud bank. That’s when I saw an oval/egg shaped object tipping back and forth but going in a straight line. It was a dull brown in color and the sun was behind it. The strange thing is that when I lowered my binoculars in disbelief; the craft was not visible to the naked eye. But when I raised them it was visible again and still going along the same trajectory which was west to east, I believe. I watched it until it went out of sight from my point of view. It was solid and had to be huge. The way it appeared in my view was as clear and solid as planes at the height and distance have appeared to me. A military jet followed roughly along the same path but above it 3-5 minutes later.  I’ve always believed in UFOs but this is my first sighting. I personally believe they are spiritual in nature but I digress.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

During September of 1988, my ex-wife and I were driving from a police training school.I was driving my Ford Econoline conversion van E/B on State route 30 just outside of Mansfield,Ohio. The event occurred as follows.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was driving and my ex-wife asked me the time. I looked at the clock in the dash and told her.The time was about 15 - 10 minutes till 11 PM.At that moment there was a brilliant, white light flash. It was so bright that it filled the entire windshield.I yelled &#34;What the hell was that?!!&#34; My ex-wife immediately started screaming. I looked at her and saw what appeared to be a blue/white ball of light floating in midair between the dash and her seat. The ball of light silently went to the right, and it disolved through the door panel. We were both stunned!! It reappeared in an instant and resummed its same position. As the ex-wife screamed the ball of light reacted to her screams.The ball of light rapidly moved back and forth, as if it were on a track.I stared at the ball of light and saw that it was actually comprised of a large grapefruit size sphere of light. This sphere was orbited at its equator by at least (6) six smaller balls of light. This ball of light, did as the first sphere did, it moved to and through the closed door panel on the passenger&#39;s side of the van. This whole event took a matter of seconds to occur, yet, between 15 and 330,30 minutes had passed!1 I NEVER STOPPED DRIVING THE VAN!!! I NEVER PULLED TO THE SIDE OF THE ROADWAY. I have no explanation of what this was or what occured during the &#34;missing time.&#34; I can only report what occurred. My ex-wife did a drawing of the balls of light when we got back to her apartment in Canton. I have not seen her for a number of years, I don&#39;t know where she is or whatever happened to the drawing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

Anyways, i walk up to my friends house and me and about 4 or 5 other kids my age were just hanging out outside.  Finally it was time to walk home.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On that walk home by myself, just looking up clear as day a huge bright light, that resembled a mini sun.  It was huge and I didnt see any particular shape or colors other than it was round and the light that emulated from it.  Being that coming down my street at the end of the block was a wooded area (where miggy&#39;s now stands) and it was hovering i would say about halfway below and above the treeline, but it was set farther back.  But you could see it above the treeline.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I know i wasnt seeing things because a neighbor, a mom of 2 was about to get into her car, but she saw what i saw and we were just both staring at it like WTF.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I never really thought about it again till a few years ago, and i can not actually say what brought the memory up, but i did remember it, and the visual scenario of it sticks with me till this day.<n>

9/20/88 03:00|Riverside|CA|Flash|6-7 seconds|Unidentified patch of light in the night sky|9/28/02|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/025/S25224.html|9|ndxe198809| Unidentified patch of light in the night sky<n> <n><n> <n><n> This event occurred somtime in September of 1988, I don&#39;t recall the exact date at this time. I was working as a school district police officer and was sitting in the middle of one of the high school campuses, writing on my patrol log. I had the window of my truck down and was using the illumination from a security light on one of the nearby buildings to write by. The sky was clear, stars visible, no moonlight that I recall. Suddenly, the interior of my truck lit up like it was daylight. My first impression was that a truck with off-road lights had pulled up behind me and suddenly turned on all its&#39; lights at once. This startled me quite a bit, as I did not hear anything, even with the window down. I looked up from my writing and into the rear view mirror, only to discover there was nothing there. I considered the possiblity of a police helicopter shining its&#39; spotlight on me, but there was no helicopter noise. Also, the spotlight from a helicopter has a blue-ish tinge to it, and has an oscillating effect due to the vibrations from the rotors. There was no sense that the light source was moving, and it was white light, like daylight. I looked out the window into the sky to try and locate the source. As I looked around, I saw an irregular patch of white light in the sky to the northeast, about 40 degrees above the horizon. The shape was roughly elliptical, but had ragged edges. The patch of light seemed to be closing in on itself, and it disappeared as I watched it. The size of the patch when I first saw it was about 4 or 5 times larger that the full moon, but much brighter. I checked the newspapers for the next several weeks to see if there was any mention of meteors or other events which would explain what I saw, but nothing ever appeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I grew up near several airports and a military aircraft factory, and am familiar with conventional aircraft. While I am not an amateur astronomer, I like to look at the sky for relaxation, and have seen various types of meteors and bolides. I have seen countless missile launches from Vandenberg AFB, and have been watching satellites since Echo 1. I have never seen anything like this before or since.<n>
9/15/88 03:00|Darlington|LA|Unknown|15 min|Blade sound passes overhead while photographing wildlife at night.|7/23/00|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/013/S13402.html|10|ndxe198809| Blade sound passes overhead while photographing wildlife at night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Arriving at 2:00 am. Sitting in a blind along Amite River, a very rural area of only hunting lands and gravel pits for miles. I came to photograph to white-tailed deer in the area on family owned land.  The weather was misty rain, windy, cool with complete very low whitish cloud coverage, moving north.  I could see fairly well up and down river. ( No details, it was dark.)  At about 3:00 am I was reclined low in a blind, facing north. (upriver) I heard a noise coming from  the north. I did not really take notice if it at first until it started gradually getting louder and louder. The sound was just like hellicopter blades . (Not at full flying speed but rather landed and idled down to a speed of one blade pass per second.) And absolutely no other sound. No engines, turbines or anything. Just the sound of the blades. The sound came from the north and went right over me and continued on down stream behind me to the south. The blade noise was so loud it was deafening. It never missed a beat as it came, pass over and continued south. When it seemed directly overhead I pulled my head down even further mostly as a reflex, for it seemed that low. I knew exactly where the noise was (just like a jet passing in clouds) but I could not see anything.  It really scared me and I just froze there waiting. As I sat there about five minutes later I heard the blade noise on the other side of the river heading north above the treetops. When it FINALLY got daylight I hiked back to my truck, (about a mile) and went back to civilazition. I no longer photograph deer at night.<n>

Well to get to our house you have to drive up a moutain, literally.... I remember looking out the back window of the car and seeing a rounded object in the sky and it appeared to be following us on the base of the moutain. It had multi-colored lights and they all blinked on and off simutaniously(spelling???). I remember my brother also commenting on the event and we were all astonished by what we saw. It was nothing like we had ever seen before. It was moving to slow to be an airplane, and it seemed to just follow us like it wanted to know where we were going, it gave us an excited but eerie sensation. After all we were all younger then! But we all knew that what we saw was ABSOLUTELY NOT AN AIRPLANE. Even to this day that is something that one can NEVER FORGET! I don&#39;t really recall the actual month day and year that we had saw this unusual - force - in the sky behind us, but I do recall that it was slightly cold outside and it was dark. slightly cold as in a SEPT. OCT. or NOV. kind of night. and another weird thing that I have also observed not only with the sighting that my siblings and I had witnessed, but as in others that I have read about or heard about, alot or a great percent is near a moutain... WHY? Do they want something from around or inside the moutains, is it better for them to sneek around near moutains, I don&#39;t understand but just thinking about it is a little eerie.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

9/9/88 21:50|Dolly Sods Wilderness Area|WV|Cigar|15-20 minutes|Witnessed "military"; C-130 releasing dozens of parachutists to meet with cigar-shaped UFO.|5/15/13|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/097/S97703.html|12|ndxe198809| Witnessed &amp;quot;military&amp;quot; C-130 releasing dozens of parachutists to meet with cigar-shaped UFO<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was hiking and camping with a good friend in the Dolly Sods Wilderness Area in West Virginia. I know this area well and have camped there maybe a hundred times previously. We were sitting on a rocky point called Lion’s Head.  It is on the west side of Red Creek and from there we could see most of Red Creek Valley from Bear Rocks area up in the north to where it curves sharply toward the west toward Laneville, WV in the south. We were effectively looking down in to a long bowl.  Suddenly, a C130 transport plane appeared over the mountain to the south at treetop level.  As it cleared the mountain top  it dropped down to the valley floor and hugged the treetops.   As it came past us it was flying below the point at which we were sitting. It followed the creek up toward the area known as Bear Rocks. As it approached the top of the plateau in the north it suddenly rose high into the sky and a dozens of paratroopers jumped out of it.  The plane continued  and we neve! r saw it again. We were somewhat amazed at this, the land where we were was a designated wilderness area, and further up near Bear Rocks the land was owned by the power company. We wondered why the military would be conducting exercises there. We decided to hike up to Bear Rocks to see what we could see.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We arrived at Bear Rocks with daylight to spare.  We looked around for any signs of these men and in spite of the fact that we were able to see the entire plateau from there, we saw nothing. We decided to setup camp there and spend the night. The evening was uneventful. Then at around 10pm we heard a noise. It sounded like generators. Looking toward the northwest we could see lights and activity in the middle of the plateau on a small hill. We could see people moving around in the lights and could hear the whirring of the generators. Occasionally, we could hear a person yell out, but we did not understand what they said. All of a sudden, we were surprised to see a huge cigar shaped craft move slowly over the scene from the north. It was between 150-200 feet long and had small round windows along its length. It made no apparent noise. The activity was frenzied beneath this craft and went on for nearly 15 minutes. Then suddenly the lights and sound disappeared. We could not see! anything else at this point. We did not see the craft leave, nor did we see where the people on the ground went.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were a bit nervous about being there that night, but we figured they were far enough away that they would not bother us. We got up quite early and left.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On our way home we decided to stop by my friends parents house. They lived in a valley in Winchester, Virginia alongside the same mountain ridge as our sighting. They were both scientists and we were excited to tell them about it. My friends Mother had designed the original lenses for the first Land Sat satellite, and his father was currently designing some method for detecting marijuana plants from space for the government. The point is, these two were not stupid. Upon hearing our story they asked us if we had been smoking any wacky weed. They seemingly had a hard time keeping a straight face and I think they really believed we were hallucinating. We then went home, both of us frustrated by their ridicule.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About 6 months later I got a call from my friend’s father. He said, “do you remember the UFO you and my son told us about? Well the whole valley has seen it. It has been hovering over the north end of the valley for the past two weekends. The police cannot or will not identify it. We all saw it.”  He went on to apologize for not believing us previously.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Many years later I spoke with someone very connected to the UFO field, a good friend actually, he mentioned a story a CIA man told him.  He said the CIA man asked him where he though most UFO activity related to the government took place. My friend answered, &amp;quot;Area 51&amp;quot;. &amp;quot;No&amp;quot;, he said, &amp;quot;West Virginia&amp;quot;.  He continued, &amp;quot;The mountains there are full of caves and underground bases and located very close to Washington, D.C.. When someone has to go out and meet with one of them, they can sneak out and be back in a few hours. The president, for instance, is watched closely. There is no way he could get out to a place like Area 51 without someone noticing, but it is easy for him to sneak out in a car in the middle of the night unnoticed and be back before anyone can realize he was gone&amp;quot;.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date is approximate.

We where standing now under this something and we get the very clear feelling that he is watching us. For about 1 minute. Than he mooved very quick back on the same route he cames. And the second one follows him in 2m,3m like a doogy.It was like a master who shows to his &#34;greenhorn&#34; how to proceed with humans...! This objects got a very strange aura. The light get an very clear border. Like in ancient pictures when double exposure was used.

It was dark outside (maybe 8 or 9pm?) and at one point, I noticed what appeared to be an airplane flying very low.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then about five minutes later, it caught my eye again because it was still very low and didn’t appear to have moved so I remember thinking it must be flying very slow.  I watched it for a while and then decided it must be a helicopter that was hovering in one spot, but I began to notice that it was very large, much larger than a helicopter.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I turned off my radio and opened the car window to listen for the sound of a helicopter and heard absolutely nothing.  The object was a very bright light and was hovering over the Xerox building on Mustang Road.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I rolled the front passenger window all the way down to get a better look.  The light was so bright and I could only see the round light; no metal, no real shape, just a bright white ball of light.  It was huge; about the size of a 3 story house.  It was hovering about 100 feet above the parking lot and it did not make a sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I suddenly realized I had slowed down to about 35 mph on the highway and quickly glanced in my rearview mirror.  The cars behind me and in front of me were also traveling very slow and the two cars in front of me took the Mustang Road exit.  I traveled on towards Yukon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On my return trip approximately 15-20 minutes later, it was gone. There were no reports on the local news.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))<n>

On a Sunday in mid-September, I was driving to a Golden Corral located on the West side of Roswell, New Mexico then located on West Second Street just East of the State Police Station also located further out on West Second.  It was a beautiful cloudless evening and I was only thinking about what I might order for dinner at a restaurant that I had only visited a few times as I normally fixed meals at my apartment located on the corner of Sunset and, whatever the cross street was, that I was driving North on, when I saw the aerial object I am reporting.  I gradually became aware that something was in my peripheral vision to my far left and up in the air possibly 15 degrees above the horizon.  As I turned my head, while driving my little pick-up truck, I saw a huge gray metal saucer or disk shaped craft, full face top-view with it&#39;s top side facing me hanging in mid-air.  I saw what looked like an aerial and portholes on what I would call a conning tower.  There was no sound whatsoever and the thing was bigger than a house.  In a matter of the blink of an eye it was gone.  My immediate impression was it was either going straight down or straight up, to or out of the ground.  There was a YMCA building to the left of the object which gave me some sense of the size of the object. However, I realized I could not figure out where it went into or out of the Earth which makes no possible logical sense.  I became so excited by what I saw I abandoned all idea of going to the Golden Corral to eat and drove my vehicle all around the adjacent neighborhood going all the way North driving around the deserted runways of the old Roswell Municipal Airport which had been converted to a Municipal Bldg including housing the Police Department.  I drove all over the whole area including all of the streets that abutted to the Airport which included a golf course and a City Park.  By this time, the thought of eating had completely left me even though I had been extremely hungr! y when I left my apartment.  I drove around there up until almost dark and finally decided to return home.  I called the N.M. State Police Headquarters and the officer wanted my name and address after I gave him the basic details as written in this account.  He said something, at this juncture, which I have never forgotten, &#34;Well, maybe you were the only one who saw it this time&#34;!  I became very fearful at this point and refused to give him my name etc, because I held a government job and knew stories about what happened to other people&#39;s careers and lives once they reported something like this, and knew I didn&#39;t want to go thru that myself.  I quickly hung up.  Then I called the relatively new Roswell Airport which is located out where the old Walker Air Force Base was and spoke with an air traffic controller, I assume, in the Control Tower.  I asked him if anyone had reported seeing anything unusual in the skys or if anyone there had seen anything?  He calmly answered no and he wanted my name etc., also.  I hung up again. Then I called the Roswell Daily Record and surpringly enough got hold of an editor who just happened to be there.  I told him the story, but said I would not give my name or any personal information.  He suggested we go to a local restaurant at some future time since nothing much is open in Roswell on a Sunday evening.  He wanted to meet with me and discuss the event later!  I never called him and tried to forget what happened.  But, unfortunately, about two weeks later I had what I would call a serious depressive episode which almost got out of hand. That was just the beginning of my personal and professional problems.  I had other experiences later which were terrifying and which I have rarely discussed with anyone out of fear of ridicule and social and professional ostracism which to some extent has happened anyway, and that is why I decided to contact u and file this report!  This is not a joke and I am not psychotic!<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We are grateful to the witness for submitting such a nice report!  Date of sighting in September 1988 is approximate.

9/1/88 05:30|Carlsberg|WA|Disk|1min|The craft ,shapped like a saucer with spinning lights,hid behind a barn when I turned to follow it|8/16/02|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/024/S24195.html|18|ndxe198809| The craft ,shapped like a saucer with spinning lights,hid behind a barn when I turned to follow it<n> <n><n> <n><n> On an early trip home from work,I was driving north on Kitchen-Dick rd.As I approached the intersection with the Old olympic Hy.I was traveling about 50 mph approx. one eighth of a mile to the stop sign,I noticed a craft flying in the distance.At first I couldn&#39;t tell how far or what it was.But as I got closer to the intersection, I could tell it wasn&#39;t normal and it was flying directly over the road in front of me.By the time I arrived at the stop sign I could see a saucer shapped craft with circular lights spinnig in sections. The top and bottom spun in opposite directions. When I reached the stop sign it passed directly in front of me. I knew i had just wittnesed a UFO.So I turned the corner to follow it and drove about twenty seconds and it turned right over an open field about two hundred yards out and turned again lowering to hide behind a barn and house.I stopped my car oppened the door and staired for about thirty seconds waiting to see if it was going to take off.It didn&#39;t.I closed the door and drove five miles to my house and woke my wife to tell her about it.I was to afraid to pursue it from the road but it was the most facinating thing I have ever seen next to child birth.As a Navy brat raised next to a Navel Air Station in Jacksonville,Fla. for fifteen plus years,I know aircraft.This wasn&#39;t like any thing that I&#39;ve ever seen before.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.
