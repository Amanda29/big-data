1/1/58 22:00|Pep|TX|Fireball|2sec|Green fire balls, Texas Panhandle, late 1950's.|12/12/09|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/073/S73056.html|3|ndxe195801| Green fire balls, Texas Panhandle, late 1950&#39;s.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My recent &#34;lights in the sky, with military jets&#34; experience of 19-Oct-2009 (which I reported to you about) has prompted me to share two other aerial sightings I have had in the past.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am now 61 years old.  I spent my childhood in West Texas, up around Lubbock, Littlefield, Levelland...places like that.  My dad was a school administrator at two small towns, Pep and Bula, which were situated some 50 miles from Lubbock, 20 miles from Littlefield.  I think at least one of them is still on the map.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As a young lad I often accompanied older farm boys, and my older brother, on jackrabbit spotlighting hunting trips.  I usually rode in the back of a pickup truck whilst older boys with 22cal rifles shot at, and sometimes hit, jackrabbits that we caught in the beam of a good spotlight.  Just drive slowly along any country road with that spotlight sweeping the pastures and you&#39;ll catch the eyes of many night creatures there on the high plains of the Texas Panhandle.<n> <n><n> <n><n> If you&#39;ve ever seen a Texas jackrabbit run you&#39;ll appreciate that this is a most sporting form of hunting, taking a great deal of skill and marksmanship.  There is a quote attributed to Chuck Yeager about country boy&#39;s marksmanship...&#34;give a hillbilly a rifle and he&#39;ll hit the bullseye every time&#34;...or something like that.  Those farm boys were good shots.  I got pretty good myself as I got older.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On two occasions I witnessed &#34;green fireballs&#34; flashing across the night sky.  One I recall distinctly was traveling roughly southwest to northeast.  Being a young lad who read science texts avidly, I just thought to myself &#34;well, that meteor must have had a lot of copper in it&#34;.  I thought this, of course, because I knew copper oxide is greenish in color.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Years later, while reading a paperback coauthored by Kevin Randle, I read an account of many sightings of green fireballs in the US.  Some, it was reported, had their likely trajectories calculated to predict impact sites--but no debris was found.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So they say.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I saw at least two of these about 50 years ago, while riding in the back of a pickup truck underneath the brilliant clear night skies of the Texas Panhandle.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date is approximate.  PD))<n>
