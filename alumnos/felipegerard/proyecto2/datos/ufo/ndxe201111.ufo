It had three white lights on it&#39;s underside and one blinking red light on the back.  It was almost silent and was flying very low at a tremendously slow speed.  It looked very flat and. I could not believe how slow it was moving.  It took between 10 to 15 minutes to get out of sight.  It was moving southeast.<n>

Ceiling is approx. 13,000 feet of heavily overcast cloud cover tonight.  The object was definitely behind some clouds as they moved by because we could see them blocking it now and then.  The sighting lasted about 5 to 10 minutes.  After about 2 minutes, it began to pulsate.  At first it was kind of hazy and faint, but then became very large and bright.  A minute or 2 later, it appeared to begin moving towards an easterly direction at a very slow rate of speed, still pulsating.  It was quite a ways off to the north west of our location, north of the airport.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was no bad weather, or air traffic, that would have caused this light.  Also, there are no lights on in town tonight that would cause such a light to appear, let alone move through the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After 5 to 10 minutes of watching, we came inside.  I checked on it a few minutes later and it had disappeared.<n>

A truck went past me heading north on the other side of the road and I seen a light green colored light above it.  I thought it was a reflection off the top of the tractor trailer at first, but after the truck passed the light was still there.  The light then headed south and disappeared within 3 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The light was circular in shape and I couldn&#39;t see any detail except that it was round and glowed light green. It seemed a little lighter in color in the center.  It was in the sky not too high above the hay field to the left of the highway heading south bound.  After the truck went passed the light moved south towards the state line and disappeared within 3 seconds.  I&#39;ve never seen anything move that fast before and I did not see it after it disappeared. There was no hills or anything to obstruct my view so I do not know where the light disappeared to.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I seen this light about a mile outside of Koshokong, MO. on the North side heading South.<n>

I have a cat and a dog.  I had to continually let my dog out and I noticed 3 lights in a straight line that looked like stars at first glance but then I noticed that they were different in color and clarity.  More of a blue/white rather than yellow/white and didn&#39;t look like the other stars around.  I had never noticed this group of stars before.  I saw them at around 20:30.  I brought my dog in but he refused to settle down and go to bed.  He was very insistant to me that something was not right.  I let him out again around 22:00 and that star formation was completely gone.  All of the other stars that were in the vacinity were there but not those  3. My pets acted strange all night.  2 of my other friends with pets told me this morn that their pets acted strange also.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

While I waited for the dog, I stood on the deck in my back yard looking at the night sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I looked to the north and noticed a bright light in sky moving south.  At first all I could see was a bright white light and thought this may be a search light on a helicopter.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As the craft approached closer to my area, I noticed it was not a helicopter.  I continued to observe and as the craft became more visible I noticed the shape was triangular and had many lights and I could no longer see the bright light only red lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I ran inside to get my husband so he could see it too.  We both watched as the craft continued overhead and moved toward the south, and watched it disappear.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This triangular shape was boxy in shape and was very big, not thin in shape at all.  It was very large and did not make a sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was not moving extremely fast, and I witnessed the craft for at least five minutes.<n>

As I looked again I couldn&#39;t tell the shape, it was bright white.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It moved slowly forward, then appeared to move backwards.  Then it looked like it was going in tiny circle, then moving left and jerking back right.  We saw occasionally a bright red light attached to it.   My friend thought it was an airplane, but as I told her, planes to not move forward and back, in circles and then left and then right.  We then saw a plane fly over and she realized that indeed what we were looking at was NO plane.  I thought maybe a Satellite? but they don&#39;t move that way either as far as I know.<n>

Lights were originally believed to be that of a military transport on approach to Fort Bragg/Pope Army Airfield, until it was noticed that the craft did not have any blinking navigational aircraft lights.  Observer lost visual contact when traveling in the low spot south of 401/Ten-Ten Road intersection.<n> <n><n> <n><n> While waiting for the traffic signal to change at the 401/Ten-Ten Road intersection, the two craft lights were noticed moving east toward the Clayton radio/TV towers, one behind the other, parallel to the ground.   The two white lights appeared to be moving as part of one object and maintained a uniform distance during travel.  Rate of movement was faster than a helicopter.  Object was traveling approximately 20-25 degrees above the horizon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Observer spotted craft a third time after passing Wake Tech campus on 401.  Craft appeared to be making a sweeping flat turn, full circle, back toward south Raleigh, approaching from the south.   Observer lost visual at approximately the intersection of 401/Ransdell Road.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Observer spotted the craft a fourth time while traveling in the vicinity of Phillips Farm.  Craft appeared to be banking (left light was higher than the right light), lined up for flight over Garner/Raleigh moving at an accelerating speed to points north.  Observer lost visual due to trees at the top of the hill north of the Phillips Farm.<n> <n><n> <n><n> By the time the observer made it to the intersection of 401/Old Stage Road the craft was no longer visible.  Observer was unable to determine if he was looking at one craft with two lights, or two crafts with one light each.  Brightness of the craft lights did not appear to change during the course of the observations and always appeared to point out from the craft, even when accelerating away to the north.  Lights were not observed pointing toward the ground.  No noise was heard.  Observation period from first sighting to last sighting was approximately 20 minutes.<n>

11/29/11 22:30|San Jose (Puerto Vallarta) (Mexico)||Unknown|4-5 minutes|UFO appeared, got fuzzy, disappeared, full moon appeared for few seconds then disappeared|5/13/12|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/087/S87855.html|13|ndxe201111| UFO appeared, got fuzzy, disappeared, full moon appeared for few seconds then disappeared<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had a very strange sighting on November 29, 2011 in San Jose Mexico.  My husband and I attended a baptismal party for our friend’s 4 year old daughter.  We arrived late in the evening from about 10:00pm to 11:00pm.   The party was on acreage, far from the city and this property bordered on the jungle with no other buildings or houses in sight.  It was very dark that night, Christmas lights were strung around the yard, lighting up the area - tables were set up and about 30 out of 300 people still in attendance -it was a beautiful atmosphere.   The party was pretty much over most guests had been there all day but a group of us who arrived late ate cake and watched the children and adults dancing in the open field.  During this time I was playing “peek a boo” with a delightful little 2 year old boy.  At the same time my husband was talking with the boy’s father as the little one ran around the table popping up in front of me and then running away.  I happened! to glance up and saw 3 very bright lights in the jungle above the trees that I had not noticed before.  I was puzzled because I knew there were no buildings in that direction and what I thought I was looking at was the top floor of an apartment building with 3 apartment windows lit up from within.  I could have easily walked to it-it was maybe a football field away, it was very close, and the object very large.  Before I continue I will state that I do not drink alcohol, nor use any mind altering substances so I wasn’t “seeing things”.    I glanced down for a few seconds to continue my game with little boy and looked back towards the object I saw the lights changed somewhat.  The light on the left was yellow, the middle light was orange tinged and the third light was whiter.   The lights were not equidistance the light on the right was close to the edge of the object and the other two lights more closely grouped.  I stared for a few seconds puzzled and something very stran! ge started to happen.  The left side of the object began to ge! t fuzzy; blurry like it was fading away it was very very strange.  I couldn’t believe my eyes and I had a very strange feeling come over me.  I kept playing with the little boy my husband was in a deep discussion so I didn’t interrupt him, thinking back now I wish I did.  The next time I looked up at this object it was gone, totally gone!  I kind of shook my head and wondered what the heck was that?  Very puzzled everything running through my head, it clearly wasn’t an airplane, it wasn’t a helicopter, it certainly wasn’t balloons and it wasn’t Chinese lanterns.  I didn&#39;t really need to go through the list of what it wasn&#39;t because it was so obviously something solid, not moving, not making any noise and I kept thinking over and over OMG what was that?  Now here is the strangest part of the whole experience.   I looked back up at the area that this object was and there was the full moon!  I was stunned, and a thought popped into my head, “it’s the moon, that’s what I saw – it was on! ly the moon!”   What struck me at that point was that the idea that it was the moon  was “planted” in my head!  Again I kind of shook my head and said no way- what the hell – that wasn’t the moon I saw.  Keep in mind I am still playing this game with the little boy.  When I looked up again the full moon was completely gone!  No object, no moon, no more thoughts, gone completely gone.  The whole sighting lasted maybe 4-5 minutes; I am guessing the object to be about 100 feet long and about 25 feet from the ground just above tree top level.  I just can’t get this event out of my head, the disappearing, shimmering, fuzzy morphing weirdness just doesn&#39;t make sense.  The fact that I felt someone or something made me think what I saw was the moon, even though that wasn&#39;t the case. Then the moon itself disappearing!  It was the strangest experience I have ever had.  Since returning home I have scoured the internet looking for something that came close to what I saw and after 3 mon! ths I finally found an object that was almost exactly what I s! aw.  It was in a UFO clip I found on the internet and I copied then cropped the picture to give you an idea of what I saw from my perspective.  I listen to you on Jeff Rense and you always say to report what you see so that is what I wanted to do.  Very very strange.  I attempted to include my  picture but wasn&#39;t able to, not sure why though.  Anyways Thanks for your great work.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Stars were very visible because there are not that many city lights in our area.  This &#34;star&#34; seemed to stand out, so I started to watch it.  I noticed it was moving, but very slowly.  It was heading west.  There were no flashing lights like that of an aircraft, and it wasn&#39;t twinkling like a star.  It just appeared as a very bright star.  I noticed it stop, then change direction and head south.  The ufo stopped again, and started making jumpy movements.  It would quickly move in a small circle, then go through a series of zig zags.  After watching for approximately an hour, it would repeatedly travel north and south while making it&#39;s jumpy movements.  We noticed the shape of the light coming off the object would change like it was rotating or something.  It would get very bright and round, then change to a long shape, and finally go back to it&#39;s original dimmer shine.  We have never noticed anything like this before.  Our! thoughts at first was the ISS, but the movement of the ufo are not that of the space station.  It did not continue in a slow straight line as if it were in orbit.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.  PD))<n>

It was shaped like a boomerang or flattened V, I guess it is referred to as a chevron shape. It was all lighted, but not very bright, almost a translucent look to it with 5-7 lights with in it that were slightly visible, all white light though.  It was traveling from east to west at a moderate speed, at first glance it looked to be just over the trees, but I believe it was much higher.  We watched it traveling in a relatively straight path and then it was just gone.  I may have second guess myself except there were two of us and we described it exactly the same.  By the time the third one could catch a look at it it had blinked out or whatever you want to call it.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I saw:<n> <n><n> <n><n> 1. Three yellow lights in a small triangle also above the horizon.  I couldn’t assess the distance.  They traveled south for 2-3 seconds and then disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 2.  Less than a minute later three lights in a triad appeared further south, and again appeared to be above the horizon. They were positioned above the door mirror of my truck.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 3.  Almost immediately four similar lights appeared, at the same moment, further south from the second triad (which were still in the sky). These four lights were in a string; the light which was on the northern end of the string was slightly lower than the second light in the string, which was to the north and slightly lower than the third light, which was, again to the north and slightly lower than the fourth light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 4.

I had noticed a single whitish light in the distance, but wasn&#39;t sure what it was.  As I continued to drive, the light was still there, and the location had not changed.  It was dark, but the sky was still somewhat lit. We pulled over and parked in a church parking lot about a mile from our home, sat and watched. The aircraft continued to hover in the same area.  All of a sudden, the center white light went off, and two round larger lights came on.  The aircraft SLOWLY started coming towards us. At this point, I&#39;d say it was a few hundred feet up.  Neither of us could see any &#34;height&#34; to this aircraft. It appeared flat. It was VERY quiet, not like the normal loud airplane passover sound you would hear. Again, it was very low, and very slow.  It was so quiet that you had to listen really close just to hear the engine. As it started coming closer I could see that the lights we! re on either end of each wing.  As it flew over us, I could just make out outline of the underside of it, and it was triangular shaped, sort of like under one of the fighter jet, but clearly had no front end, and no tail. It was clearly a triangular shaped aircraft. I honestly have no idea how big this thing was.  I just know that at the height it was flying, it was a fairly large aircraft.  I&#39;ve never seen a plan fly that slow, and have never heard one that quiet.  Thank goodness my son was with me, otherwise everyone would think I was crazy.  I took a few second video from my old cellphone; the image is small, but you can see the two lights and lightly hear the engine. It was dark, so really the only thing you can make out are the two larger lights.<n>

When I looked I thought it was an airplane since it was near the airport.  At first I saw it as a diagonal line, 4 lights only at this time I didn&#39;t care but I stared a little longer nd it moved in a way.  That&#39;s when I alerted my friends.  You had to look at it for 20 seconds for it to move.  Then we noticed it became to be a triangle?  It started to slowly turn into just one bright light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I called your hotline and I was not able to be token seriously because the guy who picked says he receives a huge amount of prank calls from kids.  I am not one of them I just REALLY need to know and I need to be told if I were right or wrong or that more people believe me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The lights were yellow and in the middle of those shapes I MAY have seen a shade.<n>

I remember thinking that we should be hearing it because of how close it seemed but it was completely silent.  It looked like, from our viewing point to be very large possibly the length of a football field.  We both looked at each other in silence because we both knew it was something crazy so I started searching for my camera, but by the time I got it out and turned it on it has disappeared behind the tree line.  We tried running in the direction that it was traveling to try and get a picture but it was nowhere to be found.  I do not believe in aliens but this experience has really confused and made  me question everything I believe and I needed to te! ll someone who might care and not think  I am crazy.

As the road curved slowly over the next few miles, I could see mostly all around it, and saw no string or pole to support it, nor any sort of propeller or engine that would indicate it was a toy, or any kind of protrusion that would show it to be a balloon or something like that.

The lights were strange because they were exceptionally bright and looked different than normal aircraft lights. It appeared to be a bright light with smaller lights below it, I thought I could see a very small tail, like an aircraft, but the entire shape looked more round, however I could not clearly make out the shape, only the lights were very clear.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Of course, I initially thought it was an aircraft just playing tricks with my eyes, but it then started rapidly moving in a horizontal direction and stop, then rapidly in a vertical direction and then stop. I don’t believe, nor have I ever believed in UFO’s, but I was completely baffled, (and a little freaked out) so I turned my vehicle in a way I could keep watching this object. It moved 6-8 times in these incredibly quick vertical/horizontal movements covering a distance that no aircraft could cover and then seem to stop in an instant. Both my daughter and I witnessed this.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I eventually had to go by a very large building and when I came out from the building I could not find the object again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> All I can say is that I can’t explain what I saw but it is something I won’t soon forget.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((name deleted))<n>

I thought I may just have been paranoia, but for the last month I&#39;ve been seeing this &#39;star&#39; just to the right of Orion&#39;s belt (usually) move in unpredictable and unexplainable ways.  To make sure it wasn&#39;t like anything else, I&#39;ve been paying special attention to the way that airplanes and satellites have been moving. I&#39;m a scientific person--and so the fact that this shape was darting in every direction across the sky all the while beaming a blueish/white light seemed extremely bizarre.  Alas, it never happened when I wanted it to, but just tonight while I was on my balcony it appeared.  Fortunately, I had my family over and I ushered them back to see it.  They all noticed the scene, and all were aghast and more or less creeped out. The disk was distant, but a faint outline could be seen. It emitted one strong light from its center and a seemingly smaller light just above that. The shape rotated ! around in the sky in bizarre motions, and, while it first appeared to the right of Orion&#39;s Belt, by the time I stopped watching it, it was to the left.<n> <n><n> <n><n> While I&#39;m sure this tale isn&#39;t as bizarre as many others reported here, I was curious to see if anyone else had seen this tonight. It seemed as though anyone looking out at the sky in the area would have noticed the event.<n>

The lights were not above the trees and they were not on the ground they were midway from the top and bottom of the trees.  There was absolutely no sound.  I ran in the house and got my binoculars and came back out and all I could see was lights that were it. Then the lights disappeared.  I got in my vehicle and drove up the road to see if I could see anything in the woods. I saw nothing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The next day I took a walk up to the woods with my husband to see if there was anything on the ground.  There was no trace of anything on the ground.

It was very yellow, like a bland yellow, and would have random blue and red flashing lights as well. Normally I wouldn&#39;t think anything of it because I&#39;d assume it was just a plane or something. But it wasn&#39;t really moving. I went outside again the next hour and it was still there, in the exact same spot. As well as the hour after that. It was very creepy and eerie. I had started to stare at the sky because of all the stars and the little dipper was twinkling. And I believe it was Orion on the left side. The yellow &#34;star&#34; was in the middle of the two.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Tonight, I was outside for a couple of minutes to smoke a cigarette as I regularly do. I looked up at the sky, to gaze at the stars as usual. I saw the little dipper twinkling again, so I looked to the left to see if Orion was there again, and it was. So I stared in the space between them, awaiting what I might see. I watched an airplane go by, to the left side, and as I kept watching, there, out of nowhere, another yellow star. It was very different from last week though.  It was the brightest yellow, almost like a sun of its own kind. It was the brightest thing in the entire sky.  I couldn&#39;t take my eyes away from it, and as I was watching it, these beams/rays of light started coming out of it like roots sprouting from a tree! There were four or five of the beams, some even seemed a little zig zagged.  I was getting nervous so I kept turning away and going to the door, but then I would go and look again thinking my eyes were playing tricks on me, and they were still there.  Still growing a little.  I ran inside to get my younger brother, he&#39;s 18, to go look at it and tell me what he saw but he was asleep and his door was locked. I went back outside and watched it for a few more minutes, got nervous, and went inside and closed my door tightly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

I went out the front door (which faces the west)and saw a low flying triangular shaped aircraft with flashing red and green lights.  At first I thought it may be something like a stealth aircraft because the Chiefs were playing at Arrowhead on this night, but then I realized most stealth aircrafts do not make noise nor do they have flashing lights.  The strange thing about this object was that it was flying just above the tree tops and it stopped and hovered for approximately 2 to 3 minutes then it did a 180 (while it was hovering) and took off at a pretty quick speed.  When I looked to the north I saw a helicopter coming at a high rate of speed toward the aircraft (we have a police helicopter station within a mile of my house),but the aircraft just seemed to vanish leaving the helicopter to just fly in circles around my neighborhood.  I guess the thing that really has me questioning what this object was is that back in the latter part of August I was walking up our street and saw the exact same aircraft hovering above the school up the street.  On this occasion my neighbor was returning home and saw it also.<n>

The sky was completely clear with many aircraft circling, but, I immediately noticed an extremely large crescent -shaped object flying at what appeared to be a much higher altitude then the known aircraft. In comparison this craft was approximately 1.5-2 inches across, at least 4 times larger than any other discernible aircraft in the sky.  The object was emitting absolutely no light or sound, and at several points it appeared that areas of the craft appeared to vanish then reappeared.   At one point, there appeared to be a very low intensity blue light that pulsed from the center of the craft and radiated out towards the tips of the wings. In effect it was as if the light was internal with-in the craft, but, the craft was covered in a smoked glass allowing it to emit and be seen.  The craft appeared to be almost! the color of the sky, similar to a dark-cloud coloration, possibly a light blue, gray or silver hue, but barely discernible from the color of the sky at the time.  The speed at which the object traveled across the sky was at a much higher rate than any of the know aircraft in the sky.  It was traveling from the west-southwest of Houston toward the east-northeast.   Neither myself, nor my sister have ever seen a craft such as this, nor have any idea of what exactly it was.<n>

There is a lot of helicopter activity in the area from the US military Garrison in the area so at first I thought it was just a helicopter.  And it was coming from the direction of the base.  But as it got closer all I could see was this orange ball of light, no red or blue flashing lights or shape of the craft, just this orange ball with no sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was pretty big and low and passed right over the bridge. I am sure other people saw it in their cars.  I wanted to stop but there was no where to stop.  I watched it come right me while trying to not crash my bike.  I  watched it until it was right above me.  I tried to find it in my review mirrors but I couldn&#39;t find it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;ve seen many helicopters flying around the area.  Flying that low you can hear them, and you can make out a shape and you can see their flying lights. I don&#39;t think it was one of those Asian lanterns, it was moving too fast, and my 6 years of living here, I&#39;ve never seen one.  I am convinced it was neither a helicopter or a lantern.<n>

I even caught 2 pictures of it on my picture phone which made the object look much smaller than it actually appeared from my point of view. (will be posted on the bottom of this page).<n> <n><n> <n><n> First, I saw a bright flash out of the corner of my eye. I thought to myself that it must have been a spotlight rotating in the sky which I see from time to time but it never came back around so I dismissed it and moved on.  Soon after, I saw 3 bright lights in the distance behind the wood line coming towards the front of my house moving at a considerably slow speed and very quiet.  While moving forward nonetheless. shortly afer spotting the oblect in the distance, it finally arrived at the top of the horizon and almost over my house.  At this time I immediately called my brother, informed him of the spotting not knowing where he was and then hung up the phone to proceed taking a video with the camera on my phone.  When I was done, in my haste, I hit the end button deleting the video.  Quickly, I started to take a picture before it was completely out of view.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I acquired two photos; One showing an object with 3 bright lights in a triangular formation on the bottom surface of an object which was not fully visible due to the darkness of it over the night sky though I do beleive it was triangular aswell. The second, shows the same light formation, this time, with the 3 white lights dimmed and a red one in the center. For whatever reason it appeared this way in the photo, I don&#39;t know, but there was a red light in the center that I could see dimming in and out behind the camera, but luckily each picture portrays a good example of the different lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After the event I walked inside of my house. 5, maybe 10 minutes go by and my brother whom I had called in the beginning has now called me back.  To my surprise, he tells me that he is on the highway about 7 miles away and could see that where it would seem our house is from where he was at, there was an object over top.  I rush back outside and there was the same exact view I had just witnessed 5 minutes before, same path, same speed, and i was in the same spot.  This confused me because now I didn&#39;t know if there was two objects, or if this one traveled back around.  It traveling around is hard to believe because of the incredibly slow speed at which it was moving.  Unless it sped up when I walked inside and it made the loop.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Anyways, after the second go around of which my brother witnessed from several miles away aswell as me, that was the end besides the conversating between the family of what had just happened. The next day some programs on the television described a phenomenon world wide of sightings just like mine that still are considered unidentified.  I was excited and so was he :)  (Images are much smaller than they actually appeared.  Also I am sorry for the poor quality.  The order sequence of taking them was first, the one with 3 white lights, then as I was a little more towards the rear, I took the one that appeared red.)   Ok, i just pasted this and no pictures show up :(  maybe i can find out how to post them elsewhere. sorry.<n>

We were sunbathing and looking up at the clouds when I noticed what looked like a floating plastic bag up high in the sky.  On closer inspection it appeared to look similar to a boomerang rotating  anti-clockwise in a North Easterly path.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It moved about the same speed as a slow plane but bared no resemblance whatsoever to a plane.  After watching it for several minutes I then noticed a twinkling pulsing light.  It looked like a star that was moving about a 10th of the pace as a shooting star, but as this was around 4pm in the afternoon it was certainly not a star.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After moving our attention to this second UFO my friend and I both saw 2 red lights appear one directly above the other.  They appeared from nowhere, flashed for about 2 seconds then dissapeared.  They were somehere between the two slightly closer to the second UFO.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After these! lights appeared we both lost vision of the other 2 UFO&#39;s. I would love some insight to this peculiar afternoon, particularly on the 2 red lights as I have never seen anything like it!!<n>

It was 45 degrees above the horizon, maybe less, it was red and white.  It seemed to pulse.  I waited for it to move. I thought it might be a plane but there were no flashing lights.  It was just red and white.  I compared it to the stars overhead and they were not as bright, but similar in size.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then as I was watching it, it faded to black, very quickly but it seemed to be a visible fade.  I waited to see if it was a cloud passing over but it did not seem to be a cloud. It did not come back.  I would have thought it was a satellite, but it was not moving and I thought it was too late in the evening to see a satellite that seemed very close.<n>

At first, there were 5 lights were rising in a column which then separated, spreading out in different directions.  All but one blinked out after only a few minutes, and the last one remained stationary for another minute or so.  As that one blinked out, we noticed another rising below it.  This final light was the brightest, and we were able to watch it for nearly 5 minutes as it rose upward then sat stationary for about 30 seconds.  It flashed red and blinked out, also.  We noticed that the object was still faintly visible.  It appeared white and travelled to the north for several minutes, where we lost track of it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We live just a few miles South of Hill Air Force Base, and we are accustomed to seeing objects in the sky.  These were not jets, helicopters, or any other aircraft that we are used to seeing.  There was no sound.   I initially thought perhaps they were flares, but the objects moved upward, hovered, and changed direction.  Also, the lights were orange and round/symmetrical.  The odd way the last light flashed red before blinking out was unlike anything I have seen before.  We watched the news for some kind of report, but there was nothing.  Surely, there are others who saw this!<n>

I looked hard for a remnant of a faint light but there was nothing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I thought maybe behind a cloud but then realized I could see many and vast stars all in the area it vanished in - so this would rule out cloud cover.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Very odd sighting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In summary; it seemed to be fairly low in the sky moving generally toward me. One glowing cherry-red center and an orange-yellow halo which diminished over time to vanish all together, and then the red center grew faint quickly and it vanished from all sight completely; seemingly moving in an upward flight into the atmosphere. No trace of any light could be seen, I could see stars. But nothing at all.<n>

What was peculiar was it&#39;s flight pattern;as it was ascending nearly vertically at first,then headed towards, then almost directly over us, on a Northerly course,which we viewed through binoculars.  Upon getting a closer view we both concurred that the object was round, a pale orange/yellowish color and no regular aircraft running lights appeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We are both fairly skeptical middle aged men,sober and have aircraft experience ,possesing analytical and perceptive observational abilities.  We both concurred that what we saw had to be a UFO.  Regrettably no pictures were taken,but we both know what we observed an hour ago was not any kind of plane or type of aircraft either one of us have ever seen.<n>

It was kinda weird to me seeing a plane that low so I thought i would keep driving towards it and maybe I could catch what it is.  When i caught up to the craft it was hovering a couple hundred feet above the ground just over the treetops and it was visible to me as clear as anything Ive ever seen.  It was a triangle shaped craft.  As i was staring at the craft i noticed the bottom of the craft had white lights at each end of the sides.  Also there was small red and blue lights in the middle of the bottom of the craft.  The craft appeared to be a shiny grey color and was motionless and no noise was emitted. After looking at the craft for a minute or two I drove away.  The size was not very large, a little larger than a small sized plane.

We didn&#39;t stop because it was raining and it was way out in a field. but when we got to the out skirts of Jerseyville we seen the police with lights on head that way.

11/26/11 11:45|Auburn|WA|Circle|5-10 minutes|2 colorful orbs playing in the sky with mothership (white orb) watching...|12/12/11|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/085/S85514.html|56|ndxe201111| 2 colorful orbs playing in the sky with mothership (white orb) watching...<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was the first to see it.  It was a bright neon indigo blue orb; it looked as if it literally came out of the sky. It the western side of the sky towards the Pacific Ocean.  It began to fly towards us but then stopped, became a royal blue color and started falling towards land at a ridiculous speed but as it was falling it started to change colors.  It kept changing from a blood red to royal blue back and forth as it fell. The way the colors changed seemed like they morphed into each other. While it was falling it came to an abrupt stop and flew left or south bound. And when it came back up, another orb appeared. This orb was a stunning turquoise color and it would morph into yellow-green but mostly stayed turquoise.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Now these two orbs would just fly around in the sky, but not necessarily in the sky but lower than airplanes would. It seemed like they were just playing around with each other because they would fly around in almost a playful manner. Continually morphing into the different colors. The royal blue orb can fly the highest into the air but the turquoise orb could not it would remain lower.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Now, on the right side, a white orb began to appear.  It slowly appeared into a bigger white orb. The thing about all the orbs was that they were solids; they looked like they had a core center with a a lighter color aura around them. The lighter color was the same color as the core color regardless of how much it changed colors but it was more translucent. Now, the white orb never moved it stayed perfectly stil, almost just hovering in the air. There was a time when the aura on the white orb became bigger but went back to it original size.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The two colorful orbs were playfully flying around in the sky; i noticed they would never get really close to the white orb but will fly around it. There was about 3 air planes that flew by. It seemed as if the two that were coming north bound seen it because they were flying really close to each other like they were scared. Air planes do not normally fly that close to each other.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The two colorful obs began to play more vigorously; they were doing trick like going from opposite sides of the sky and flying really fast towards each other like they were going to smash but right before would steer off in opposite directions. Then slowly the two orbs slowly flew towards the white orb and formed a triangle. The triangle stayed in the position for a few minutes. It stayed perfectly stil just hovering in the sky. I believe the white orb represented the 90 degree angle. The royal blue orb was directly north of the white orb and the turquoise orb was left/south of the white orb.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After they stopped making the triangle formation, the royal blue and turquoise orb went back to the south/left side of the sky and they continued flying in a circular motion/ figure 8 motion. Then the royal blue flew back north from where it originally came from, the turquoise went back to the left/south side and just disappeared. The white orb slowly faded out.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What I noticed was that the positions the orbs came from, though they were very much apart, still formed a triangle. The best way to describe it was like connecting the constellations and it formed a triangle.  We watched for a while but it did not return; we returned about 10 minutes later but they were not there.<n>

I reappeared 5 more times.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On  Saturday, November 26, 2011.  Awaking around 4:45 am, I decided to go outside and check out anything that might be happening in the sky.  I was looking directly north over the shoreline of Lake Ontario, on the New York state side, approximately 30 miles west of Rochester, NY.  A white filled circle appeared directly north, 45 degree angle from the water surface, through a very light cover of clouds over the lake.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Quite large in size, half the size of the full moon, it was displayed for 4 seconds or so, it didn&#39;t move in the sky, no noise, and no flashing lights, then the circle disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It reappeared to the right (east) again, the distance of two times its diameter, same size, same distance from the water, then went out.  This occurred 2 more times and there was nothing.  I decided to flash my high powered light, no response.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I continued to look to the north only to have this happen again, farther to the east, approx. half mile around 5 minutes later (5:20 am).  Only one display of this white filled circle. The position over the water was the same.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I continued to watch until it happen again, 5:30 am, back where it was originally started.  Again same size, same display time and position over the water, no noise or flashing lights but only one display and no more.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I continued watching for another hour or so until the sun started to show itself.<n>

For some reason I felt compelled to look up at a star behind me, to the southeast.  As I was doing so, I saw the UFO come from the eastern horizon and zoom past to the southwestern horizon.  It was too low to be a plane, but too high to have been anything else.  It was incredibly fast. It crossed from horizon to horizon in the fraction of seconds.  It was a very bright color, orange and yellow, and it did have a tail, like a comet would have, but could not have been a comet.  There are no reports of comet sightings in my area. I suppose scientists might call it a fireball, but it did not appear to be on fire.  As it passed it didn&#39;t make a single sound, very eerie.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))<n>

If you view this direction with Google Maps Street View, you see the power lines going above the apartments, garages and alley – the object we saw was hovering above the highest power line.<n> <n><n> <n><n> DESCRIPTION My daughter and granddaughter had gone out my building’s back door into the alley and called my phone to come out and look. It looked like a burning object, and I thought maybe it was an aircraft or a meteor, but it did not appear to be moving and there was no contrail. Then we saw a big burning piece fall straight down from the main object. This piece was smaller than the main object, left a trail of sparks and embers, and seemed to burn out and disappear before it traveled a quarter of the way from the object toward earth. This happened two or three more times, additional chunks falling in similar fashion from the main object while the main object continued to burn brightly - I say “burn” because it seemed to change shape and flare the way a fire does, and it was bright reddish orange and yellow like flames.<n> <n><n> <n><n> DURATION This went on for 2-5 minutes (it is difficult to estimate the time since we were so stunned by this – it was unlike anything we’d ever seen before), and then the main object’s “flame” seemed to suddenly go out, although we could still see the object, now looking like a very dim star.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The dim spot remained stationery for another 30 seconds to a minute, then started very slowly moving downward. As it got below (from our vantage point) the highest power line, it appeared to start moving south as it also gradually sank lower – the southward motion seemed faster than the downward motion and we lost sight of it after 2-5 minutes when the building across the alley (east) from us blocked our view.<n>

It moved at a moderate pace and slowed down to a stall.  After stopping about 2-3 blocks from my house the object flew straight up and to the south at a high rate of speed (like nothing I have seen in the sky).  I thought it might be a helicopter at first, but this object made no noise.  In fact I thought to myself that it was odd that just about every dog within a mile was going crazy.  So much so that after the event when I went in to tell my wife what happened, my dog went flying out of the house to see what all the commotion was about.  It was a very gloomy winter evening and the clouds were very low.   I live along a flight path of the Minneapolis airport.   I waited for three planes to come in and land and could hardly see the headlights of one of the three commercial jets landing.  This object was flying very low.  Assuming it was about two or three blocks away I would guess it was 20 feet across.   Every hair on my body was standing on end.  It was the most incredible thing I have ever seen.   Nothing about the way this thing moved was consistent with anything I have seen during the 36 years of my life.  I&#39;ve been online looking for anyone else that saw it.  I haven&#39;t found anyone and post this in hopes that others will come forward.<n>

These round objects appeared out of nowhere and started to cross the sky.  The appeared to start out in in a straight line but were stagged by the time they were directly overhead.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The color was amazing and we immediately new that they were not an airplane.  They were a brilliant orange/rust color and the only time we lost them was when they went behind the clouds in the northern sky and several just dissappeared completely.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am a 43 year old male with a college degree in criminal justice and my wife is an office manager at a doctors office. Our dogs were acting odd during this event, they were growling and whimpering as the objects passed overhead.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke via telephone with this witness, and we found him to be exceptionally eloquent and objective, in his description of the event.

I&#39;d say I was about halfway between the Green Mountain Post Office and the bridge that crosses the Toe River which separates Yancey and Mitchell County.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It&#39;s already totally dark outside, and being a rural area the only light comes from the occasional house and any trains that might be passing - the tracks are on the other side of the river.  But there were no trains last night during my drive.<n> <n><n> <n><n> An object in the sky over across the river catches my eye, a bright, round, greenish-white ball which is moving somewhat slowly.  My first thought was along the lines of &#34;Roman Candle?&#34; I can&#39;t recall if it really seemed to be moving in an arc like the firework would, or if my mind was playing tricks with me because that was the only thing that made sense at that moment.<n> <n><n> <n><n> But then, just seconds later it disappeared, with an effect not unlike ships jumping into Hyperspace in the Star Wars movies.  It was there, then it seemed to zip away and just vanish.  At this point I had come to a complete stop in the road, but didn&#39;t see anything else out of the ordinary.<n>

I got my phone out and started taking video of the lights, when another formation of lights rose up, this time there were five lights, the same color, in a much larger, somewhat uneven triangle pattern (Same direction).  At this point people walking down the street, and eating outside at Tano stopped what they were doing to watch it, many getting out their phones as well and recording it.  There was at least one child next to me that was really scared.  Both sets of lights continued to rise up form the horizon, appearing to rise almost vertically, before vanishing as we watched, while passing overhead.  I&#39;m still not sure whether they were 2 separate craft with multiple lights on each, or 8 craft with one light each.  I live in the area, and come to this spot all the time, and I&#39;ve never seen anything like this in my life.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Note: I did see aircraft in the vicinity before and after the event, however they appeared to be civilian, and I am not aware of any that were in the vicinity during the event.  I would also prefer to be contacted by email if need be, only use the phone number if you have to.<n>

I took multiple photos of the clouds that were in a strange shape around the sun, one cloud had rainbow colors all around it.  then I noticed in the first two photos a light sphere was above 1 of the clouds, with a diamond shape right next to it, then in the second photo, the light sphere had moved higher.  We hadn&#39;t noticed the light sphere when I took the photos.  then the clouds began to move swiftly , perhaps the wind, but their shapes continued to look odd and very defined lines on edges of clouds.  I took several more photos, of the odd looking clouds, but without any more UFOs.<n>
11/25/11 05:30|Mullingar (Ireland)||Unknown|photo|I can't figure out what I have been witnessing!!|12/12/11|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/085/S85482.html|73|ndxe201111| I can&#39;t figure out what I have been witnessing!!<n> <n><n> <n><n> I decided to walk my dog before work as she was beginning to dig a lot of holes around the lawns and such so I thought that if I started doing this, it would calm her down a bit from doing these things.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It is still dark when I wake up so I decided to grab a torch and go with her then which is usually around 05:30 - 06:00 am.  As I walked along my local road which is a small road and very quiet, I noticed a red flashing light going across the sky which also changed to a yellow flashing light in quick succession.  At first I thought that this was a plane going across and carried on but still glanced up at it as I walked. I soon noticed that this object, whatever it was, was flying in strange flight paths as it moved up and down and also went faster and slower, like it was hovering in the air.  I was amazed to see this as I could hear no sound to prove that it could be a helicopter.  I carried on focusing on it and as I had a torch with me, I pointed it towards this and flashed the torch by turning it on and off just out of curiosity. Suddenly the strange lights just dis-appeared on me.  I carried on with the walk wondering to myself what it might be. As I had walked about a mile, I decided to turn back and head for home. About halfway back I noticed it again but in a different area of the sky doing the same thing, just hovering across the sky and stopping for a couple of seconds, turning to go the other way and then turning back the way it was going and moving on only to dis-appear again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I got home I looked again and just over my village, I noticed a white light about the same size of a star in the sky but much lower and it was hovering over the village itself going back and forward and up and down.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This amazed me so I said to myself to do the same the next morning to see if I would see it again and to my surprise I did!! It was the same lights, yellow, red and white changing to each colour quickly like they were going round in a circle. I had my camera this time but as soon as my flash went off these lights dis-appeared again and  nothing showed up on my camera.  I focused up on the sky looking around to see if I could find it.It was an overcast sky as rain was due to fall later that morning but yet I could see the stars. As I looked closely around the stars, I noticed that these so called stars were moving in different places, some moving fast accross the sky and stopping and others slowly, sometimes just dis-appearing. I found this so unexplainable and in between all these white lights in the sky the flashing red,yellow and white object appeared, going across the sky hovering up and down slowly as though it was examining the area( that&#39;s what it seemed like to me).  I grew really interested in all this especially because what I believed was stars were moving around also! The next morning I decided to go out earlier and was out at about 4:30 am with my camera and decided to just take random pictures one after another and see what I can pick up at the end of it all.  Over a period of 2 mornings, today and yesterday morning I took a total of 230 pictures and some that I caught were very interesting.  I caught one or two that I simply cannot explain and would be willing to share them with you if you would like to hear from me further on this matter.  That is basically all for now. If you want to hear from me then that is okay by me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Upto now I was very skeptical about all this but as of now, my mind is in two places as to what is going on around here in the night sky.<n>

The object continued to hover in the same spot for some 12 minutes.  It was unlike anything that I&#39;ve ever witnessed and at one point changed to a very bright blue/green color.  After realizing that this could not have been a helicopter because it made no sound whatsoever yet was within 1/2 a mile from my location, my concern prompted me to wake my roommate.  We were both in amazement because again, we had both never seen this type of foreign abject before.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Quoting my roommate &#34;I&#39;ve been looking my whole life to spot a ufo and as much as I&#39;ve wanted to see one, I can truly say that until this moment I never have&#34;   We both cannot believe that this object can in any way be of this world.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After observing for about 12 minutes the object suddenly moved vertically at a medium speed, then in a flash moved horizontally to the west and disappeared.<n>

Watching the starred sky, not a single cloud, I noticed what I thought was a shooting star.  After longer observation I realized they were 9 lights, in 3 different lines.  Three redish-coral neon lights in front row, three behind and three on the last line. I thought they were all togehter, like a long rectangular form, but then I noticed the three lights in the middle started to move from one side to the other, like if they wanted to outflank the one ahead of him, although it didnt. It went back to its original possition after a litte wiggling .They seem to aim for Cozumel which is the island in front of Playa del Carmen, where I live.  I watched carefuly until I saw them dissapear behind the trees.<n>
11/24/11 21:50|Visalia|CA|Unknown|15-20 minutes|4 lights moving in a precise pattern as though on the perimeter of a sphere.  ((NUFORC Note:  Advertising light.  PD))|12/12/11|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/085/S85479.html|77|ndxe201111| 4 lights moving in a precise pattern as though on the perimeter of a sphere, following us for 15 mi.to our home<n> <n><n> <n><n> This happened last night (Thanksgiving) between 9:45 and 10:00 pm.  We were traveling in our car south on Highway 99 from Fresno toward Visalia.  There was a cloud cover and I looked out my right side window ( West) and noticed some dancing white lights.  At first I thought it was a spot light being shown up into the sky, perhaps to attract people to a Black Friday shopping location.  However, there weren&#39;t any stores near where this was occurring.  I kept watching them while my husband was driving. The lights were moving in a very distinct and exact pattern.  There were four of them.  They were in a circle and they would rotate perfectly to the left about 90 degrees and then they all converged and meet as one in the middle of this circle.  Then they would move back out to the perimeter of the circle, rotate to the left,  then once again converge to the middle and start over again. I say circle because although I could not see anything but the lights, the pattern they moved in was a circle.  Each of the 4 lights was the same size and they were softened by the cloud cover between the  actual light and us. This changing of the pattern was constant and occurred several times each minute. It was as though they were on the outer edges of a round object, would rotate 1/4 way around the object, all come back to the middle of the object, then return to the outer edges.  I remarked to my husband that it looked like the lights were doing a square dance. The precision that they moved in was completely consistent every time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then, as we traveled down the highway the lights stayed right with us along the highway, traveling just west of us but staying with us,  I mentioned this to my husband, and he saw them as well. We had traveled at least ten miles since I first noticed them, but they stayed right with us. This really had our attention.  We took the off ramp to exit the highway and stopped at the top of the ramp as there was no traffic behind us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We watched the lights travel and stop right in front of us, (up in the sky of course) and hover there and the lights never wavered from their moving pattern, It kind of freaked me out that they stopped and hovered there as we stopped at the top of the ramp. We turned left and traveled three or four miles north to the road where we live, which is a state highway.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The lights stayed above us and to the right of us, but definitely with us.  We got to our road, and I was really feeling some anxiety. We turned left and traveled about 3/4 of a mile to our ranch and I couldn&#39;t see them behind us.  I was relieved! We had to hang a u turn to get into our driveway, and there were those 4 lights, hovering just off our driveway, right next to our house.  We rolled down the windows to try to hear anything, but there was complete silence.  I thought several crazy thoughts because it was very weird.  I felt like whatever it was knew I had noticed it and decided to follow us.  I was freaked out and got into the house as quickly as possible.  My husband had to go check on the livestock and said it was still out there when he came in.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I called the sheriff&#39;s office this morning and no reports of any lights came in from anyone, but they gave me the information to contact you, so this is what we saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My husband is a rancher and farmer, has been in business over 50 years I am a retired business owner, serve on several boards and am very active in the community.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Advertising light.

Its lights changed from white to red mimicking a regular craft, although several other colors were also a factor such as amber, blue, burgandy, and green... The colors seem to Pulsate and move around the craft on a clockwise motion assuming there were identicle lights on the opposite side of what I witness.  It made no noise and the only craft it could be compared to would be a blimp, but it was going extremely too rapidt.  The light were larger that what I can make out of the craft. Traveled from east going westbound toward Streamwood until I lost sight of it.<n>

Went outside at about 10 pm,the cabin where we are is far away from any big cities and looked at the horizon and saw a round flashing light in the sky.  It was not there the night before or the next night.  The object changed colors rapidly from pink, red, blue, purple, green and seemed to stay in one spot.  I watched this object through binoculars and so did my dad and we could not figure out what it was.  I took a video with my cell phone but it was pretty far away but you can see the object changing colors.  I even have a jet flying over it in the night sky and the craft still did not move. Ive been going to this same location for 15 years and have never seen this before in my life,  The craft stayed in the same place for about 45minutes then would shift position in the sky.  I watched this object for well over an hour and it had no noise or any jet like features.<n>

It was a beautiful day and I had one heineken and one wine over the course of over six hours.  Plus all of the beautiful food, just putting it in perspective.  Along Butter Lane which is a windy lane with a stream running along it, I saw a weird round sphere, bright red and sparkling like a firecracker floating along the treetops. I was scared! It was like nothing I had ever seen.  Plus there was no traffic along this road at the time so I was totally creeped out.  Another car passed me going the opposite way and then one followed me onto my street, which made me feel a little bit better. I&#39;m telling you, I was freaked out! I pulled into my driveway, locked the car door and made a beeline into my kitchen.  I put my purse on the counter, picked up my kitchen phone and went back outside.  I looked at the sky and the damned thing is coming from behind the houses across the street.  And it looked pretty close too. My best friend lives next door and he still had company from Thanksgiving from the cars in the driveway.  I dialed his number but it was on answering machine.  The thing was now gone.  But I know what I saw.<n>

In the Eastern sky over Lathrop CA and headed toward Manteca CA the next city over, there were about 8-10 red lights in formation floating in the sky.  It seemed that the lights were moving slowly West to East.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first I tried to rationalize the lights as Asian Sky Lanterns but all of the lights moved in formation like a flock of birds and always maintained the same speed and interval.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My neighbor also saw the lights, though I cannot say that he was sober that night.  Hopefully this report is part of a bigger puzzle from that night.<n>

As we were driving towards Knightdale, in Raleigh, on Highway 64 business, we saw something shoot from the sky straight down and disappear.  It had a glow to it as it shot down, and came down within a blink of an eye. Then, a little while later as we were standing in line on black Friday outside behind the best buy building, my boyfriend said, &#34;Look.&#34;  As I look up, and so did the other people in line behind and ahead of us, I saw two circular saucers flying in a staggered formation, one was slightly ahead of the other, across the skyline. It was almost like they were floating as they were moving, their movement was very fluid. Once we realized what they were, they were gone.  They disappeared extremely fast. They looked like they were very dark gray or black with dull, glowing lights around the bottom.  The other people in line also saw this, and were amazed. I know what I saw was not anything of this world.<n>

They did not seem to come towards the earth, but appeared to be passing by in space?  One of our witnesses seen two more 20 mins later, same area and projection of travel.<n>

One was behind the other a bit staggered and as I watched, the rear light turned towards the ocean.  I continued to watch the other orange light moving slowly towards Charleston, and I noticed a triangular shape..the orange light on the front tip.  It was flying extremely low, yet absolutely no sound, and the shape was very clear.  As I watched for about another minute or so, the object veered towards the ocean as well.  The orange light slowly began to dissipate and after ten seconds or so, it just disappeared completely out of sight.  There were no clouds as far as I could see.  It just disappeared.  I looked up higher to see if I could see more, then saw the blinking lights of an airplane coming the opposite way where the object disappeared.  Not five seconds later, I saw a beautiful shooting star!<n>

I looked out to the southwest and there above the tree line was an orange ball just sitting there.  I watched for a few minutes and thought why is it just sitting there and it didn’t look like any plane I had seen before.  There was no sound like a plane.  There was no sound at all.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I went out to the field that runs south along the side of the house so I could get a direct view of this object.  Once out there a second one moved vertically up from behind the tree line.   Now there are two of them sitting there.  Then, they started moving horizontally slowly back and forth, but they were not doing this in tandem.  They also moved slowly vertically, again not in tandem.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After about 3 hours one moved to the north again vertically and vanished behind the wood line and the other in the same fashion followed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I went back to the house but kept going outside looking up to see if whatever these were would show up and about fifteen minutes later I saw one coming directly overhead. This would be now moving in a western direction.  It stopped over the house.  It was now at a much higher elevation.  I watched it for about fifteen minutes and then went back in the house.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I returned and it was gone so I went to the front of the house and there it was stationary in the front of the house.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I decided to go back out to the field to see if the second orange ball might have returned to the place in the southwest where I had first seen these objects, but it was not there.  I was about to go back in the house when directly south two more orange orbs came up vertically from behind the tree line.  They were moving in the same fashion as the first two balls. And then they began to move horizontally to the south.<n> <n><n> <n><n> All these objects were moving, not drifting.  It was about 11:30PM and I began to get a creepy feeling about these objects so I went back to the house.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At 1:00PM I went back out to see is the orb that had stopped at the front of the house was still there and it was.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I came back to visit my mother at Christmas the orb at the front of the house was still there.  Between Thanksgiving and Christmas I had asked my mother if the object was still in the front of the house and the answer was always yes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It is no longer there, so I don’t know what these objects might have been but they were like nothing I had ever seen before.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I took the most interest in watching these objects but there were two other observers.  Whether they would be willing to write their opinions I would have to ask.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD))<n>

She ran outside and pointed out 5 lights that were moving quickly north.  My mom said that when she was driving, there were at least twice as many lights, arranged in two groups.  One group was arrayed in a wedge shape, and the other was in a line.  She had tried calling us on her cell phone, but she couldn’t find it in the car.  She saw a man that had pulled over at a nearby intersection who had gotten out of his car to watch the lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The remaining lights were all in a north-south line, more or less evenly spaced.  The lights were a strange amber / orange color, unlike any we had ever seen on an aircraft.  The lights did not blink, they remained a constant glow.  One by one the lights flew north rapidly and disappeared into cloud banks.  We couldn’t hear any noise from the lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was dark with a high cloud cover and intermittent showers<n>

We looked west/southwest and saw a bright, hovering light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first, I thought it was Jupiter or a possible helicopter, but I found Jupiter.  I had the other two look at the light, just to see if they could figure it out-that&#39;s when we thought &#34;UFO&#34;.  I ran and grabbed my camera and got a couple minutes of it.  I could see pulsating and the colors went from red to green to amber.  We watched it until it dropped behind the building next door. It moved slowly left to right and descended.  I looked at it with my Yukon Ranger night scope and it appeared to be just an orb of light that pulsated.<n>

My entire family saw the event.  I&#39;m not a believer, but this was undeniable occurrence.  The first one we saw went up and split into two and traveled into space at the same rate.  The next five were all in a single file line appearing in the same area. It looked like the fire trail from a Space Shuttle launch at night.<n>

My father who doesn’t believe in anything like UFOs starts to tell us that these two lights have been there for a while.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Hearing my father explain this I can see he was very serious about these lights and I can hear the fear in his voice.  The rest of us can’t believe what we are seeing and start to question if it’s a helicopter (nope they are to close together and there’s no sound), flares (it would of went out by now,) whatever explanations we are trying to come up with it is being tossed out the window.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As we figure out what we are seeing the orange lights suddenly move to the right of us.  They move simultaneously together gracefully through the sky, we try to follow them bobbin are heads trying to see through the trees when all of sudden the lights disappear. We all look at each other laughing trying to explain what we have just seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A day goes by and I try to see if maybe the local news or news paper put something out there.

The Power outage spread from Hamilton in Ravalli county all the way to Missoula in Missoula county.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There were mixed reports of what caused the outage.  The Missoulian reported that the National Weather Service reported that there where no clear or known reasons for the outage.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Another report by local news KPAX reported that high gusting winds may have caused it.  However, in Missoula winds were and still are 15 mph as reported by local hourly news on the radio.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I called my mom and she got on the internet to check it out and at that time she read their was a  local report that mentioned that witnessess saw blue-green lights in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I could not find that stated when I searched later but did see that all local reports via internet had been revised from their original ! report.  Possibly excluding the witness reports of the lights?  I think so.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have lived in missoula 22 years and Ive never seen an outage taking the whole city.  As soon as it happened I felt like sometihng was wrong.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So did my sister across town and because so many people were talking about it at the gas station where my boyfriend was working at the time of the event, he too said he &#34;felt something was up&#34;<n>

Then the light slowly turn away from me then continuing on its course flying very high from the northwest towards the north at about 35,000 feet then the single light was turned off, I quickly got up to see if there was any other sort of lights on the craft but saw none and the craft seem to have disappeared I could not see it or its lights.<n>

I make a left from my current street and head my ascent up a large winding quarter mile hill. As I put my foot on the gas I notice an object over head, pretty high in the sky, about 50 degrees up from my horizon. This object was red on one side and green on the other, but from a far away distance it just looked like a red and green small blob moving across the sky in a sweeping flying motion. As I neared the middle of the distance of the long street, the flying object went out of view and basically just disappeared. I don’t know of many helicopters or planes that visible or low at midnight but ill just pass it off as a normal sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I just ignored the sighting until all of a sudden at least 20 feet above my car there was a huge v like aircraft. This aircraft was about 10 ft long side to side and had a series of about 20 large square lights from side to side on the front of the V which was facing me.  The lights on one side were green and the other 10 or so extremely bright lights were red on the other side.  Once I saw this I swear my stomach dropped and I floored my car.  All I knew was that this wasn’t any toy plane at midnight or anything else I have ever seen.  This object flew over my car in the opposite direction I was going.  As I looked above over my steering wheel I could see the lights so distinctly like it was burned into the back of my eyes.  As I quickly drove off I could see it distinctly behind me until I got to a good observation point above the small city less than 20 seconds later.  It was gone. If anyone had similar experiences, please tell, or tell me what I saw.  Thanks<n>

I was looking an noticed that there was not just one white light but many lights flashing randomly in the sky around a large object that had many colored lights.

The closer it came to me i could tell that it was round. it had red yellow, blue, etc., lights in a circle pattern seeming to be the bottom.  It also had a few lights shining out the sides.  It flew verry slow and seemed to be traveling twords my car.  It came very close crossing right above my car.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was big as far as i could tell, as it was verry low and traveling slow.  I think it may have been changing colors and the pattern on the bottom was changing a little i cant be sure.  I was very scared and after i had passed the area I didnt really look back.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was scared it was following me because it had flew so close and right towards and then above my car.

The other three objects were very faint, however we could tell that the colour of these objects alternated between white, orange and red.<n> <n><n> <n><n> All four objects were observed to hover for periods of time, then move vertically back and forth, then horizontally, then in circular motions.  One object we observed shot across the sky from one location to another at a speed that seemed almost effortless.<n> <n><n> <n><n> One object, a bright ball, appeared and sped across the sky, then disappeared. It was bright white.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We returned indoors after we witnessed this activity.  I returned outside, but I could not locate the objects.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I would be most interested to have corroboration of this sighting from other people in the Toronto area.  As the lights were very faint and, by appearance, very high, I would suspect other people in the region of south-western Ontario may have also seen them.<n>

If I held a quarter at arm&#39;s length, they would have been about that size.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I first thought it was a string of balloons floating but there was no line apparent between them and they were moving against the wind.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Their height and speed did not change while visible.  They were at a height such that they would have had to be extremely large balloons if that is what they were.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They moved in a line except at one point where they formed a cluster and then moved back out into a line.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I looked down to get my phone to take a picture, and when I looked up again they were in a cluster, then one in the cluster began to move away and they formed a line again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They were visible for about a minute to a minute and a half and then seemingly disappeared. I was not able to get a picture.  The camera would not focus on them aga! inst the blue sky.<n>

I stayed by the window for at least three min, then saw the light outside starting to change color from little green to little red. I mean the sky was so bright i thought it was day time already.  I could not figure out what type of light actually does such good job from the distants.  it turned the night sky into day time and I could not tell where was the light coming from except the woods.<n>

I had been looking Northwest at the low hanging clouds over Merrill Field Airport (Small Aircraft Airport and turned my gaze to my left which is Southwest and said out loud to myself &#34;what is that&#34; and there at the end of a low hanging cloud was a round silver metallic object hanging motionless.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I live near this area and I&#39;m familiar with all of the small aircraft and helicopters that land at Merrill field. And this object was like nothing I had ever seen and was completely still.  This part of 15th is very busy so I went up the hill and made the first left to see if i could get a view looking East, no sign of the object,I drove around for quite awhile and it was gone.<n>

I thought I was seeing a meteor until the orange light appeared again and all of a sudden a small silver u shape craft with blue and red lights was traveling roof height a couple of houses in front of me. I thought it was a remote controlled toy until it made a sharp turn to the right and went straight up a few feet. I lost sight until I turned right and noticed it traveling the same height  and next to powerlines. At this point it changed into a ball of white light and slowly proceed up till it appeared to be completely stopped in one place. It was still dusk out and the object appeared brighter then any star. I had pulled over and called a friend and we both observed the object bouncing around in one place for about twenty minuets. Finally it stopped and appeared to get smaller until it looked like a star. I am shook up about it to this day,<n>

This area is more open with pastures for dairy farming and there is also a garbage refuse center so there is no city or neighborhood in the area.  It had just gotten dark as i was passing through the area so everyone had their headlights on, it had just rained earlier that day so the clouds in the sky were breaking up allowing for the night sky to be seen in fragments.  Driving along i had a sudden urge to lean forward over the steering wheel and look up out into the sky, it was kind of one of those feelings that i just got, not to look for anything in particular but just to look at the sky.  At just that moment i could see part of a cloud illuminate with a fluorescent green color and through a break in the clouds a bright ball of green light descended at quite a fast pace.  It dropped maybe 500ft or so from the cloud cover which might have been a 1000ft! above.  This green ball of light was traveling extremely fast toward the north and was only descending down to then sweep back up towards the clouds, before reaching the clouds it picked up speed, a lot of speed.  It stayed below the clouds but began moving so fast that it disappeared before my eyes.  The duration of the sighting may have only been about 30sec. but was indeed something I have never witnessed in my life.  The object was a solid ball of light, its color was green and when it began picking up speed there was no trail behind it.  It looked as though it had come through the clouds dipping for seconds before going so fast i could not see it anymore.<n>

It was already dark and shortly after 5:00 pm.  She was on the freeway very close to the Smith College exit into Northampton, MA when she saw flashing lights out of the corner of her eye.  She looked through her windshield to the right and saw a diamond-shaped object that appeared to be either very close--about 200 yards away and only 500 or so feet up--or very large.  This was a discreet object.  Each point of the diamond-shaped object had a red light.  These red lights flashed rhythmically and in unison. Every now and again, a white, translucent light would &#34;scatter&#34; flash across and around the body of the craft.  She says that the craft appeared to be metallic, that she could clearly see its shape, and that it was stationary.  She tried to take a picture of it with her cell phone, but was so rattled that her hand blocked the shot (she continued to! drive down the freeway during her sighting).  She glanced down to place her cell phone on the passenger seat and when she looked back up (after only a couple of seconds), the craft was gone.  She pulled over to the side of the highway and got out of her car to search the sky because she couldn&#39;t fathom how the object could simply disappear the way it did.<n> <n><n> <n><n> She said that the experience was &#34;freaky,&#34; but not frightening.  She said that she immediately felt that what she was seeing was &#34;not normal,&#34; and she said that she felt as if she was being observed during her sighting.  She also thinks it&#39;s significant that the object disappeared immediately after she tried to take a picture of it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When she got back to Smith College, she talked about her sighting to several of her friends, one of whom volunteered that this past summer, she had also had a sighting of a diamond-shaped UFO just sitting over a Burger King in Amherst.  This area of Massachusetts is known as Pioneer Valley.<n>

My wife was driving and said &#34;Look at That&#34;. I looked up and saw what appeared to be a Triangular shaped craft near by and flying lower than usual. The shape was clearly defined and easy to see. It was triangular in shape, an isosceles triangle the size of a large airliner. It was a grey/blue colour. It was moving very slowly and close enough that I should of heard its engines, but did not hear anything. I doubt it was more than a mile away and less than a thousand feet up. The craft was making a starboard turn and when I saw the rear of the craft there were lights across the rear except near the corners. Each corner had a white light as did the Centre of the triangle. The lights on the bottom of the craft flickered and it changed the appearance quite a bit, although you could definitely see the triangular outline of the craft. The arrangement of the ligh! ts made it appear like an air liner. A few seconds later, the lights flickered again and this time it looked like the lights of several small planes. looking back on thinks, I really should have pulled over and taken things in better. My wife really wasn&#39;t all that excited about it and just kept heading to the restaurant. I guess that was because the only real difference between what we saw and an airliner was the triangular shape. It seemed to move differently though, almost turning like a boat.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

11/21/11 02:19|Woodland|CA|Unknown|10 minutes|Early morning abduction/visitation on november 21, 2011|12/12/11|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/085/S85491.html|130|ndxe201111| early morning abduction / visitation on november21,2011<n> <n><n> <n><n> This event took place in my bed at my mothers house in the early morning hours of November 21, 2011.This is a report of an abduction by what I believe to be of alien origin.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It began as a feeling of something approaching my bedroom and I thought that it was the family cat making his way to my bedroom. The house has hardwood floors and that makes it easy to hear footfalls approaching the room you’re in. The footfalls were very light and faint and that’s what made me think they were from the cat. The next thing I know the “cat” was on my bed and I could feel it next to my head. I thought it was strange that the cat was able to jump up onto the bed and get to the far side of my head with out me noticing him walking over there.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The “cat which I will now call the ENTITY because I later believed that this is more closely a description of what was interacting with me. I tried to reach up with my hand and pet the “cat” but I could not feel him there . Next I felt him on my thighs and again I thought it strange that he could travel down to my legs without me noticing him walking down there. Once I felt him on my thighs I reached down to pet him again and once more he was not there , I could not feel him.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The room was dark and I was underneath a down comforter and a light quilt as the event continued. My whole body was now underneath the covers and my hands were laying on my chest, my body laid out straight , and I was lying on my back, eyes open. The next thing I realize is a feeling of strange energy-like infused foggy mist forming above my bed. The darkness in the room was being lit up slightly by this energized fog. In my mind I felt a very weird feeling of confusion and a feeling of something taking over my thoughts in some strange way. I should say that words can’t accurately describe what exactly was going on inside my mind, so the reader of this should just bear with me on this description.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The thoughts of the “cat” being on me was something I feel was a foreign thought being put in my mind to make me feel ok with what was going on. Again words can’t describe this feeling, I felt confused but not scared…YET. The very next thing that happened was a feeling of being stood up against a wall that had a depression in it the exact width of my body, with my hands at my side. This wall looked like wood grained paneling and my face was just a fraction of an inch away from touching it. The next feeling was that of motion. This motion was like the wall gave way and my whole body was moving forward into this wall, I was still standing as I moved into the wall. The motion continued forward then either up or down or I really cant say which way I was headed. The motion stopped and I felt like I was still in my bedroom though. The room I was in looked just like my bedroom, but I think that’s because this thought was being placed into my mind.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The next thing I see is an object that looked like an elongated cell phone with a touch screen face on it. This object was about eight inches long and the width was about 2 inches across. The screen of this object was lit and had something like letters or symbols scrolling across it . The vision of this object was so clear and real to me that I began to really wonder what the hell was it doing floating above me . this device was floating above my left side  perpendicular to the bed surface facing to my right side. I then noticed that it was streaming a strange light up over my body to a point up on the wall to my right about a foot from the ceiling. Now this really puzzeled me and that’s when I began to feel panicked. It was right then that I felt that this was really happening and It was impossible that this could be going on. I then felt that I should try to grab this device and make it stop scanning me. I could not move a muscle, I found my whole body paralyzed, the onl! y way I was seeing this take place was through my eyes that could not move either. I could only see what was in my field of vision all the way out to my peripheral limits.This was enough to see the whole room wall to wall. I was very scared to find myself paralyzed with this device traveling the length of my body up and down . I decided to scream and see if that at least made my mother hear me and come rescue me from this madness. I tried to scream and nothing came out, I tried harder as I began to really panic, tears were streaming down my cheeks now and inside my mind I was screaming like a frightened child. I had the feeling that an Entity was in that room with me and they were not going to stop doing what they were doing. I couldn’t see any “person” holding that device but I was sure they were near and controlling the whole situation. I tried to scream one last time and this time I heard a quiet scream eminate from my mouth and echo in the room.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Well this was enough apparently to scare away whatever was doing this to me. The device disappeared and the foggy mist was gone.  I thought to try to see if I was still paralyzed and thank god I could now move my arms and turn my head.  It was nothing like waking from a dream, it was like being released from a paralyzed state.  My eyes were open the whole time, and now I realized how frightened I was because the tears were wet on my face, I was shaking and I was out of breath. My next thought was to make my way out of bed before whatever it was came back and paralyzed me again. I was so scared like I never have been In my whole life. It took every bit of courage I had to get out of bed and run to my mothers room. I am a 50 year old man and I felt like a three year old running to my mommy for help. I did make it out of the bedroom and down the hall to her room. I spoke to her as I approached her room and she woke up and turned on her light to find me standing there shivering an! d crying asking her if she heard me scream.  She said no she did not hear me scream and what was goin on, why was I waking her up, what was the matter.  I thought this entity was just in the other room still watching me, so I was whispering that something weird just visited me in bed and that I thought it was still close by. We stayed in her room and talked about what happened for about an hour until I calmed downed. She tried to make me believe that it was a dream but I have had dreams and nightmares before and this was not anything like that. This essentially ends the event for the moment. It happened again about an hour later after I returned to bed, but that will be for a different time to report if at all because I can’t say for sure it wasn’t a bad dream caused by the original event…<n>

It was Sunday, evening between 8:05 and 8:10pm on November 20th, 2011. My daughter, (age 33) who was driving, said, “What was that! Did you see that?” She immediately stopped the car and we both looked to our left. We were in a heavily wooded area. What we saw were many, many bright lights. The lights were so bright they looked like burning magnesium. The lights were beyond the trees. My daughter describes them as more blue than I do. We were puzzled because they most appeared like fireworks but did not act like fireworks, in that they were not falling and fading out. What my daughter saw initially she describes as maybe a comet with a tail exploding. I did not see the initial “comet.” In reference to the many bright, white lights, I said, it is strange what would someone be celebrating on a Sunday evening in Snohomish. I erroneously thought we were looking due west towar! ds the town of Snohomish. We watched the lights for about 30 seconds and I said, “Let’s go up on the ridge to see if there are more lights.” So, instead of heading right at the intersection, towards our home, we headed left. (Given that we were in a heavily wooded area, there is no way to have seen a comet with a tail streak across the sky.)  About 1 ½ miles from where we saw the lights first we stopped. I realized the lights had been almost due north--not west. There were no more lights but there was a glowing gray/green column. The sky was fairly clear and the sky dark. We stopped the car and turned off the car lights to look at the glowing column. The glow was not such that it would jump out at you if you were scanning the sky but yet was very visible. The column was between 40 and 50 degrees on the horizon. We watched for maybe 30-60 seconds, and I said, “I’m tired, let’s go home.” My daughter had picked me up from the airport as I had been out-of-town for five days.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Just as my daughter started up the car and turned on the car lights, three bright white angular objects appeared and disappeared into the column or the column enveloped them. I said, “Oh, there are three more.” My daughter did not see this as her head was turned left to do a U-turn to head back home. Two of the angular objects were about as large as a VW bug, one was a little larger. I have no idea why I chose the VW bug as something to compare the size. I cannot describe the shapes---only that they were angular. I cannot say if they were triangular—just angular. They did not line-up but were somewhat in a vertical line. I had the feeling we were very close to whatever this was.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It struck me just how weird this all was when we neared our driveway I called my husband and said to him, “There has been an event in the sky, come and meet us at the end of the driveway.” He did, we drove across the street and up the hill. He saw the glowing column, but no lights. There was also a second, but much dimmer glowing column to the left of the first one. We watched it for maybe 5 minutes and then went home.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

They didn’t leave any trails or make a noise.

This aircraft was flying at a very slow speed and could move horizontally and vertically.  We were able to watch it for about 15 minutes.  I tried to take a picture of it but it did not turn out well at all.<n> <n><n> <n><n> October/November 2011 I am a night owl and we live in a relatively rural area.  I am always out watching for raccoons so they do not get the feral cats and typically am watching the night sky.  Lately I have noticed several bright lights that do not appear to be stars nor satellites (yes, my boyfriend already said that I was probably seeing a satellite, but I am college educated and have taken numerous astronomy classes, so I definitely know the difference) There are two distinctly bright orbs that appear to be relatively close.  They seem to set off some type of flare or flash and seem to illuminate.  Around the two brightest orbs dimmer orbs seem to come and go.  The bright object and the dimmer objects are very distinctly positioned, so these are not just some random lights, they are patterned.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Early this morning, Sunday, November 20, 2011 I was looking in one of my typical observation spots in the sky (same place we saw the aircraft object last summer) and all of the sudden there was what appeared to be a very slow shooting star and/or comet type object except I could see a disc like object in it and it left a very visible trail.  The disc disappeared; almost as if it were going into a wormhole or time warp, yet the trail of smoke or cloud lingered on beyond the time I stayed to observe (15 minutes+) I had never seen anything like it.  The sky was clear and my visibility was excellent.  I felt lucky to have seen something so amazing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I decided to go online and search UFO sightings in Skagit County, Washington to see if there are any other night owls or sunbathers who have spotted these phenomena?  I will continue to watch, most of the time I feel like I am being watched in return.  It is very odd.<n>

11/19/11 22:30|Stafford|VA|Other|~ 1 hour|Very large boomerang-shaped object with 3 large bright front lights and low engine noise glided low overhead|12/12/11|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/085/S85554.html|142|ndxe201111| Very large boomerang-shaped object with 3 large bright front lights and low engine noise glided low overhead<n> <n><n> <n><n> On the night of November 19, 2011, at about 10:30 pm, I was in my house in Stafford, VA.  I was by myself at the time.  The weather was clear.  I noticed through my sliding door a very bright object in the sky, toward the east.  The angle of elevation from my viewpoint was probably about 45 degrees.  The big lights were white, but it also had a few blinking red lights, not the normal red and green lights you would see on the wings of a commercial airplane.  I am accustomed to seeing planes in the night sky as we are on a path toward the DC airports.  This was much lower than the planes normally fly and was traveling roughly north to south rather than the normal south to north-flying planes we are accustomed to seeing at night heading toward the airports.  My first thought was that it must be a helicopter with searchlights and I wondered for whom or what they might be searching.  There was another plane in the area when I noticed the object, but it was m! uch higher and appeared to be just a plane on its normal route toward the airport.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I continued to watch it, the object moved very slowly in a southerly direction.  I noticed that the extremely bright lights were not aimed at the ground as if it were a search helicopter.  It moved behind the trees in back of my house.  I thought it was strange, but figured I’d seen the last of it so I went and sat down.  From my chair where I was watching TV I can see that same section of the sky. Maybe 5 or 10 minutes later, I saw what I assume was the same object traveling back this way, south to north.  As it got closer, it slowly turned and moved toward my house, just over the power lines.  When it turned toward me I could see that it was very large and had 3 huge, round white lights spaced widely and evenly across the front.  I could see for certain by now that it was not a helicopter.  Plus, we see and hear plenty of helicopters here due to our proximity to the Quantico Marine Corps Base and other military installations.  I am very familiar with the loud sound! of a helicopter going by.  As it approached, I began to hear that it was only making a low sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I walked out onto my back porch and watched as it got closer and closer.  It appeared to be getting lower toward the ground.  For some reason, I wasn’t afraid that it was going to crash, I assume because I could tell how slowly it was moving and it seemed to be under control.  It was simply mesmerizing and I was transfixed watching it.  I was frustrated that I was home alone and couldn’t yell for someone to come see what I was seeing.  As I watched, it glided by very slowly and rather quietly, but not silently, almost overhead.  From my porch, it appeared to pass about 30-50 feet to the south of me.  I would compare the sound and movement to a boat with a trolling motor, only flying, or the sound somewhat like a lawnmower in the distance.  It certainly wasn’t the sound of a normal plane engine, which would have been rather deafening at that close range.  I am not familiar with a plane that can fly that quietly and slowly or with the configuration of the 3 huge lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As it passed by, the intensity of the lights was no longer interfering with my view of the object.  I was looking at it from underneath so I could make out the shape, probably aided by the small streetlight that is almost below where it passed.  It was dark and appeared to be somewhat of a boomerang shape.  There were no lights on the underneath side.  If I were to compare it to a full moon, I’d estimate that from side to side it would be larger than 10 or 12 moons.  It’s difficult to say at night, but I’d guess it was about 200 feet above the ground.  From the time it first came into view from underneath until it went over the trees was about 10 seconds.  I could still see it through the small stand of trees beside my house, but I didn’t have an unobstructed view any more.  It was like standing on the runway if a 747 could glide quietly in for a landing, except it wasn’t shaped like a commercial airplane.  It was quite large.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It continued gliding across the road in front of my house, and across the field as it curved toward the south and disappeared beyond the trees.  A little while later, maybe 15 or 20 minutes, one of my sons came home and I told him what I had seen.  Within about another 20 minutes, I saw bright lights again traveling from north to south, similar to where I had seen them the first time.  At this point, my son looked out and saw the object and commented on how bright and low it was.  He watched until it disappeared behind the trees in our yard.  Typical of his not wanting to appear too excited and since he hadn’t witnessed what I had seen before, he went back into the kitchen, but I walked out behind my house so I could see behind the trees and watched as it moved south.  It never disappeared from sight, but eventually I determined that it was moving closer again and a little higher in the sky.  Oddly, the appearance of the lights didn’t change like it had turned around – ! more like it was backing up.  The bright lights were no longer visible.  It came back the way it went, behind my house, higher this time and moving more quickly, but with no white lights on the front, just the red flashing lights on the body.  I watched as it flew north and out of sight.  That was the last I saw of it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There are several rows of high-tension power lines behind my house, running somewhat north and south.  It was over these at some points, but didn’t necessarily follow the lines, especially when it headed south – the lines run a little more south-west and it traveled a little more south-east.  And, of course, when it turned and came toward me and continued in a slow circle to the south it wasn’t over the lines.  Other than my son, who just got a brief look at the object when it was more in the distance, I’m not aware of any other witnesses, although I don’t know how anyone out at that time could have missed it if it passed near them as low and slow as it was here.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is the second time I have seen something unusual behind my house.  The first time was a night almost two years ago and involved something large with only red lights, some blinking and some steady, descending into view through my back door then quickly flipping one end downward and rapidly descending out of sight behind the small hill in my back yard, at about a 45 – 50 degree angle, into the trees or the creek.  That whole incident lasted only maybe 5 or 10 seconds.  My first thought was that a plane had caught a wing on the power line and gone down.  My husband and I ran outside but never saw anything more.  From where he was sitting, he didn’t see the lights but followed me out based on my reaction of shock.  As I thought about it, I realized it didn’t have any white lights like a plane or helicopter would normally have at night and there was no loud noise as a plane or helicopter would have made at that distance.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I’ve lived in this house for 24 years and have seen plenty of planes and helicopters out the back door and windows, as that is where my den is and my chair faces toward that direction.  These two incidents were definitely unusual.  I know what they weren’t – weather balloons, swamp gas, ball lightning… but I’d certainly like to know what they were.  If the large object that nearly flew over my house is military and it’s ours, then good for us.  I don’t know why they would test fly it low over a housing development in Northern Virginia, though.  Very puzzling.  I can’t say that what I saw was an extra-terrestrial UFO, but it was F. and it was an O. and it was definitely U. to me.  If someone can give me a plausible explanation that would be great because no one with whom I’ve spoken has been able to come up with one.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is the statement from my son:  On the night of November 19, 2011 I came home around 11:00 pm and saw my Mom standing on the back deck looking up into the sky.  She explained to me that she had just been watching a large aircraft that had been slowly moving through the sky at a low altitude, with a strange light pattern that didn’t resemble an airplane.  Because we live near Quantico, I said it could have been one of their planes and went inside.  About 20 minutes later, she said she saw it outside again so we walked out onto the back porch and saw a much brighter than normal aircraft flying just over the tree line, heading south.  It was moving slower than the airplanes that we frequently see.  The lights on it didn’t resemble the lights on a normal airplane.  It had extremely large front white lights that didn’t shoot a beam forward like headlights, but lit up a large area around the front of the aircraft.  It seemed to be very large, bigger than a regular jet airplane, which we often see flying behind our house.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The aircraft continued along the tree line from our vantage point until I could no longer see it through the trees from the porch.  I thought it was gone, so I walked back into the house, but my Mom walked back up onto the hill to see if she could get a better look at it.  I have seen airplanes fly over the house my entire life since we are on one of the flight paths for Washington airports and we live near Quantico.  This didn’t resemble any passenger jet or any other aircraft I’ve seen over the years.  When passenger jets, helicopters and military aircraft fly over, they make a clearly audible sound.  During the time I observed the aircraft, I didn’t hear any sound coming from it.  I’m curious to know what it was.<n>

They were almost flickering like a fire seen from a distance, but they maintained a constant orange color throughout my observation.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I watched them move silently at a moderate speed to the south.  As they passed behind my house, I thought that I saw one of them make some erratic movements, but it might have simply been a distortion effect as there were some thin tree branches in the way on that side of the house.  They made no sound throughout the event.<n> <n><n> <n><n> An airliner passed to the west at about 15,000ft, maybe 20 miles away, and I would think that the crew probably would have seen it well if they had been looking in this direction, but during the busy time of an approach, they may not have noticed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My house lies right under the arrival corridor for aircraft coming in to ATL from the Southwest, which is a very busy arrival, so there may have been other aircraft in the vicinity that I didn’t notice.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Regarding my background, I am an airline pilot for a large airline based in Atlanta.<n>

This morning, at approximately 11:15--11:20 A.M., we were driving north on Myer Blvd. in McKeesport.  I stopped at the stop sign at the intersection of Myer and Riverview and my eye was immediately drawn to a bright light visible in the sky directly ahead of me above the northern horizon.  I saw that the light was reflecting from a metallic silver object, and I thought it was odd because it seemed so much brighter than the jets or planes I&#39;ve seen before in the sky.  My instant reaction was to think this was a conventional aircraft of some kind, and I watched it, thinking that in a second or two a wing structure would become visible as the craft moved toward the north-east.  When no wing structure appeared after a few seconds, I called my wife&#39;s attention to the object.  She immediately saw it at that point and was as puzzled by it as I was.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object appeared to be cigar shaped. It was metallic and silvery looking.  There were no wings, propellers, lights, or markings visible anywhere on it.  The object left no contrail, nor could we hear any sound coming from it (although a sound would have been hard to hear because our car&#39;s engine was running and our windows were not rolled down.)<n> <n><n> <n><n> In the center of the aircraft appeared what looked like a series of rectangular windows. (My wife said she didn&#39;t see this feature.) It was moving in a slightly north-easterly direction at about the same speed as a conventional aircraft would move.<n> <n><n> <n><n> With growing curiosity, I turned the car left and drove up Riverview in order to track the object and keep it in sight. We watched it head into the north-east for a while, and then it suddenly vanished.  I don&#39;t know if it flew behind the clouds.  We suddenly were unable to find it in the sky.<n>

It appeared in front of us with two outer white lights and two vertical red flashing lights in the middle.  It was as low as the tree line and clearly right in front of us.  It sped way ahead of us and stayed distant as we were driving down Salem church road.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At the light in front of chick fa le turning right onto route three it was first going the same direction as us.  And then quickly reversed and started going along right beside our car about normal building height.  It turned sideways and the lights started changing to yellow and it starting racing downwards scaring us half to death because it was so close we thought it was going to crash into our car.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We sped up and it attentively returned to normal direction. It follwed us unrolled we parked. Yet it stayed in the sky all night but moving upwards until it looked as small as a star.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The next day when the story wa! s told to our parents they said they had seen the same thing flying around the house at ten pm last night.<n>

The date was November 19th, 2011. The place was Alma, Wisconsin in Buffalo County along the Mississippi River. I was waiting for it to become light and passed the time by looking up into the clear dark sky to watch the stars and perhaps catch a few shooting stars. I was sitting facing North, looking a bit west.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was pleased to see two shooting stars within a minute of each other and then watched as a Satellite crossed the sky from my right to left or East to West. I was looking Northwest about 11:00 high at the time.  I just had glanced at my watch which indicated 6:05am when I thought I saw another Satellite coming again from the East at the same spot as the other Satellite.  At about half way across my line of sight the object suddenly stopped. Something I never saw before.  Then the object began a pattern of what appeared to be a series of 45 degree turns.  Each time the change of direction was sharp followed by an impossibly fast acceleration and sudden stop.  The distance traveled each time was consistent. It then settled into a clockwise pattern repeating the angles and advance as before. The object became dim and then bright leading me to believe it was getting further away and the closer as it circled.  Next it did the original pattern again of different directions before once a! gain, settling into the clockwise pattern.  I was afraid to take my eyes off the object in fear that I would lose sight of it. I also was aware that it was becoming light and that has dawn was approaching I would soon not be able to witness the event anymore. The object was still visible as more and more stars faded out.  I noted that there were 4 bright stars that the object was centered in the middle of, that were the last to fade. These formed a trapezoid around the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At shortly after 6:20 the sky became too light to see any stars including the strange object I witnessed dancing in the morning sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Later in the afternoon when I met up with the rest of our hunting party, I told them of my encounter. They were skeptical and were even making jokes when my 20 year old nephew chimed in and said he saw the same UFO that morning but was afraid to say anything.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I saw something similar when I was about 15 years old with friends, but over time decided it must have been our imaginations. I am now 51 and it was not my imagination that recent opening morning of Deer Hunting! I believe we have the ability to track most anything that comes close to earth and this would be no exception. I personally believe this may have been something our own government knows about or is testing high up in our atmosphere.<n>

Almost into Muskingum County we had noticed a really bright, what we thought was a star, light in the sky.  We kept talking about how bright it was and thought that it had to be a star because it wasn’t moving but that we had never seen a star that bright.  Even the North Star in our area doesn’t show as bright as this light on the clearest of nights.  My mom mentioned that maybe it was the position of the star or the fact that the night was so clear.  As we moved closer my mom said that it almost looked like there was a red light blinking on the side of it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So then we assumed it was a tower of some sort but the bigger white light still didn’t blink like most tower light do and have to because they are so high in the sky.  We got closer and it got brighter and larger.  As we rounded the bend and started to enter into Zanesville it was right there above a field and some houses on the West Bound side on 70.  What we had initially thought was one large white star, then a white tower light with one red smaller light, ended up being a triangle shaped object with 3 large separate white lights and two red lights on the back end points of the object. It was still very still, almost hovering over this area of fields and houses.  I wanted to pull off to the side but with the rate of speed I was going and there were cars right behind me I couldn’t get over in time.  The first exit into Zanesville was just around the right bend. We hurried off of the exit, then headed back west on 40 which runs parallel to 70 to the area that we saw this craft. We drove the road to the area and it wasn’t there. It was so big and so slow that it should have still been there. But it was gone. It just vanished.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke via telephone with this witness, and he seemed to us to be quite sober-minded and credible.  PD))<n>

We were watching this burning light in the sky right over the trees that did not appear to be a star.  It was to low and bright to be a star and there were no blinking lights to identify the object as an aircraft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We continued to watch it thinking that maybe we would see it move either away or towards us so we could identify it, but when It did move it was vary fast and the color of a burning ball of fire,  and the burning light did not move in a straight line it was more of a curved zig zag movement.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I continued to ask her if she was seeing the same thing above the trees as I was and that I was not just seeing something that was not there.  She confirmed that I was seeing the same thing as she was.  When it passed over us there were no noises coming from the light.  I am intrigued by this and so are the others who have spotted this same burning light in our town.  We continue to watch the night sky hoping we can get another glimpse of this burning orange and red object that continues to surprise us every time we see it.<n>

The object headed NW and held a very steady altitude and speed, almost as if it was on cruise control.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What was most noticeable were the lights on the rear end of the craft.  From my vantage point, I watched the object from behind and had a clear visual of the back end of the object.  It appeared to have a large panel of lights on the rear end of it.  In the center of the panel were three red lights in the shape of a triangle that illuminated in and out slowly.  There were other white lights that surrounded the triangular shaped lights in the center but these did not dim in and out as the red ones did.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I watched the object until it disappeared behind a tree line.  The light characteristics, altitude and speed remained constant throughout the entire duration of the sighting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am an avid stargazer and night sky observer and am very familiar with the characteristics of airplanes and helicopters, especially at night.  What I saw this particular night did not fit either of those descriptions.<n>

Traveling at 55 MPH on Ohio State Route 5, heading West-South West my friend saw a bright blue light, approximately the size of very bright star or small planet. The object had a light blue color to it and was very bright.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I looked at the object, which was stationary, for about 4-5 seconds.  Just then, the object made a sharp, fast movement to the right of viewing traveling about three or four inches in my scale of the sky view. It then rapidly decelerated, and continued to travel, this time at a slower pace, to the right where it disappeared behind the clouds.  The light had an approximate height of 45 degrees from the ground.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Visibility shaken, we both asked each other if we saw what we thought we saw. We continued along the highway, but were not again able to identify the object. When we returned home, we immediately turned to the internet in an attempt to see if anyone else had seen the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I do not believe that the object was either a helicopter or plane, due to its stationary state then instant acceleration to the right followed by rapid deceleration. The object darted and then slowed in a way I have seen no other object do so.<n> <n><n> <n><n> For the record, neither myself nor my friend had had any alcoholic beverages that night, nor were either of us under the influence of any legal or illegal substance.<n>

The sky was clear when suddenly an object appeared. I thought it was a shooting star at first, but it vanished and then reappeared.  There was not tail, or trail of any kind, no visible propulsion system and the object was silent.  It was smaller than a full moon and the shape was sort of like a boomerang, but with a point coming out the back in the middle. It was NOT “V” shaped, or triangular, or chevron shaped, it was rounded on the front, almost like a sickle blade, not pointed.  The whole object was glowing an almost orange-cream color. It was moving incredibly fast, I only saw it for MAYBE 5 seconds, and in that time it shot across the sky and I lost it as it went over my roof.  If I point to where I first saw it and where I lost it, my arms are at about a 110 degree angle. It was definitely not an air plane or helicopter, there were no flashing lights on it and it was moving! way too fast.  Its presence didn&#39;t seem to have any effect on my dog, I don&#39;t think he even noticed it, but I have never seen anything like it before.  I called the local Air force base to see if they were running any training exercises in the area and they said they weren&#39;t, and when I told them what I saw, they said it definitely was not theirs.  They referred me to call the air port and see if they knew anything about it, when I spoke with operations at Tampa International Airport, they knew nothing about what I saw. The light from the object didn&#39;t seem to go anywhere, as in it wasn&#39;t like a beam from a search light or anything of that nature, the object was simply...glowing. The object appeared in the NW and headed SE.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The night sky was clear, there were no clouds and the temperature was in the low 30’s F.  There was moderate ambient light from the streetlights and neighborhood homes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> While gazing at the night sky I noticed an irregularity of movement in the sky overhead.  I could not focus on it at first when it was directly overhead but as it moved away from me, I started to discern a shape to the form.  It was triangular with truncated tips.  The leading two edges of the form had what appeared to be a series of round soft edge openings that where slightly lighter than the main body of the object.  There were approx. 12 of these.   Their outline was not hard but was soft edged and appeared to be in motion.   The object itself was as black as the night sky.  There were no running lights thhat would normally be associated with an aircraft.  There were no other discernable features only the silhouette of shape with the leading edge feature.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object made no noise and it moved from the northwest to the southeast.  I would guesstimate it’s altitude to be approx two to three thousand feet.  The span of the object was significant along the trailing edge, approx. 300 feet.  The incident was approximately 20 seconds in duration from when I first noticed until it disappeared in the southeast horizon.<n>

They were approximately 500 to 600 square feet in size and were silently hovering just above the tree tops (cottonwood trees approximately 100 feet tall) on the west side of NE 29th Avenue as we were driving southbound, right before coming to the stop sign on NE 29th Avenue at NE 219th Street.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We had drove by it very slowly looking up towards it on the west side of NE 29th Ave and then continued on to the store, but in the short time of no more than 7 - 8 minutes they were gone when we drove back by the place we had just seen it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We scanned the sky as we continued home a few blocks down from where we had seen it on NE 29th Avenue, but now we didn&#39;t see anything.  It was totally gone or was it just out of our eyesight?

They were both heading east over highway 24 towards the prairies. they were only about 500 feet high and were the size of about a 5 bedroom house. They were exactly identical.  They both had a red, green, and yellow light at each corner.  The only difference is the one on the right had a white blinking light at the front and a red blinking light at the rear.  That did not blink with a rhythm like our aircraft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I saw them perfectly clear.  They were so black on the bottom, that they blacked out the light of the stars above them.  They were about 40 ft. apart from each other and never shifted from their flight path or elevation.

My mom, sister, girlfriend, and I quickly went outside where we witnessed 16 orb shapes blinking different colors and what appeared to be within the middle of them fireballs falling from the sky.  The fireballs looked similar to a flame thrower and a large rumble could be heard when they were seen.  The fireballs lasted for about five minutes from when I witnessed the event and the orbs remained for another 15 minutes afterward before they slowly moved away in all directions.  During this time, our cell phones, internet, and cameras could not picture anything.<n>

As I was walking back up the steps to the door I noticed a strange light in the East/Southeast.  At first it didn’t appear to be moving but seemed too bright to be a star.  I stood and watched and about 10 seconds later it started moving towards my house.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As it got closer I noticed it was triangular in shape and had two white lights and one red light on it.  The lights were very bright. It was flying extremely slow and at very low altitude, however I couldn’t hear it. I continued to watch and it flew directly over me.  It probably took 3 minutes from the first I saw it until it disappeared over the tree tops.<n>

I could only see the shiny reflection of them as it was dark out already.  It was just above the powerlines from my perspective, so not very high in the sky.  As I watched, it &#34;floated&#34; by in a very fast, steady &amp; straight direction.  If it were baloons, it should be gaining altitute but it just kept going straight from west to east.  There was no sound whatsoever.  As I continued to watch, it looked as if it tilted onto it&#39;s side and morphed into several lights in the shape of an M, then vanished.  I have no clue what it was, but it definately was not baloons.  As soon as it vanished, there were several planes much higher above flying around close together.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I came around the bend onward to our destination. Right above the tree line were three bright lights in a triangular shape. I asked myself aloud &#34;What is that? What is that?!&#34;  My daughter, who was in the front passenger seat said, &#34;I was just going to say that!&#34;  I told her I didn&#39;t know.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I continued on the side road around the second bend; it remained hovering in place to my right , no more than 2 to 3 blocks over from where we were.  There was no sound.  I slowed the car down. I told my daughter to get out the phone to take a picture but she said &#34;No, this is freaking me out!&#34;  I stopped the car and switched gears to reverse.  At this time the three lights faded into six small bright lights, still in the same triangular shape and it headed north very slowly among the treeline.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I dropped my daughter off at her friend&#39;s house (she ran in and yelling me she would call me in a bit). I could still vaguely see the lights as I backed out of the driveway, among the trees. I headed back down Carroll St. to Old State Rd. towards St Rt. 45 in Champion. I continued on until I reached St. Rt. 305 before heading home.  There was nothing in the sky that even remotely looked like this. This was between 5:50pm and 6:00pm.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have called and reported this to the Champion Police department, and was told that they would pass this information on to their officers.<n>

As I rounded the first bend, right above the tree line were three bright white lights in a triangular shape. I said aloud to myself &#34;What is that?  What is that?!&#34;  To which my passenger replied, &#34;I was just about to say that!&#34;  We had traveled down this dead end road many times before, and had never seen this! I continued on the side road around the next bend; the object remained hovering in place with it&#39;s three large lights about two to three blocks away.  There was no sound (I had my window cracked open). I slowed the car down and told my passenger to get out the phone and take a picture to which they replied &#34;No! I&#39;m freaked out!&#34; I stopped the car and put it in reverse. As I inched my way backward, the object dimmed the three lights until they faded and changed into six small bright white lights, still in the same triangular shape and it headed north very slowly ! among the treeline. I continued on to our destination just four houses away, no more than 200-300 ft., my passenger jumped out as soon as I pulled into the drive and ran to the house yelling &#34;I&#39;ll call you later!&#34; I backed out of the driveway and was still faintly able to see the lights between the trees on the bend. I headed back down Carroll St. around the bends. However, I was unable to keep sight of the object as I had to drive west before I was able to return to driving east or north. I turned east onto Old State Rd. until I came to St Rt. 45 in Champion. I continued to head north on St. Rt. 45 until I reached 305, before heading home. There was nothing in the sky above the houses or trees that even remotely looked like the object. There was one plane in the air that I could see at this time but was very high in altitude and moving along the basic flight paths. This incident transpired between 5:50pm and 6:00pm on November 17, 2011.<n>

It was almost a fixed point.  I stayed there for 10 minutes or so before I left, simply because I was busy and hoped I could capture it from my home, only 3 minutes away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Unfortunately, living amongst the mountains made it impossible to see the object as it was now blocked by a nearby mountain.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Also of note is the fact that it did not make any sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I don&#39;t know if it were a craft, but it&#39;s certainly a phenomenon unknown to me.<n>

The upper layer of lights extended past the edge of the bottom one, which appeared more rounded than rectangular.  I watched the craft leaving no contrail, and then, suddenly, jolting to a stop, it begin to move forward in waves, like it was being tossed in the wind.

Also, a satellite in low orbit should have been out out of the sunlight by the time is was directly overhead and this object never lost any of its brilliance even after passing out of sight to the east.  It also appeared to maintain its spacing behind the aircraft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Saturn had been recently very prominent in our sky but was much smaller than this object and the color was much different.

We thought it was strange that we could hear them, but could not see the lights from any of them. I could tell they were directly over us, judging by the sound. My witness and I leaned out of our windows to visually inspect the sky above us.  We were able to spot the silhouette of three CH46 helicopters that were completely blacked out.  Those are just the ones I was able to get a visual on.  We can’t tell how many others there were that passed overhead, I just know that there were several.  They were flying unusually low.  I can’t say exactly how high up, but you figure, those helicopters do not go above 10,000 feet.  They were much lo! wer than that, though. Maybe 20 seconds after they passed overhead, we got a visual on something else in the sky.  It was round and looked like a spot light.  It pretty much resembled the spot light from another helicopter. The light was pulsating at a very slow rate and was moving through the sky in the same direction as the helicopters that had passed overhead, but was at a good distance behind and at the same altitude.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Whatever was flying over us made no sound.  We could hear the beat of the helicopters in the distance, but heard nothing overhead. After approximately 10-15 seconds of having a visual, we exited the vehicle to get a better look.  Upon exiting the vehicle, we saw the light of this craft flash on and off maybe three more times and then it disappeared completely.  No lights, no sound, no silhouette.  It was just gone.<n>

I had heard a helicopter in the distance and dogs in the yard barking about 30 seconds prior and stepped outside to observe.  The helicopter was fairly low, about 500 feet or less AGL.  It appeared to be on the same heading as the object and appeared to be in pursuit.  I spend a good portion of my time observing and studying aircraft, and what I saw was quite obviously no aircraft.  It was completely silent and appeared to be traveling at 800+ knots.  It, along with the helicopter appeared to be on a heading of about 180 magnetic.  I believe that this was a UFO because of the incredible speed and the lack of navigation lights or sound that would accompany an aircraft.<n>

We suspect that she is an exceptionally capable witness.  PD))<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> UFO Sighting: November 16, 2011<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was driving home from work the evening of Wednesday, November 16, 2011 on County Rd D through the White River Marsh located between Berlin and Princeton WI.  It was very dark and I was about halfway through the marsh, I don’t drive very fast because the marsh road is very curvy and I was approaching some &#34;S&#34; curves when I noticed a car parked alongside the road with its lights on.   This is rare in the marsh so I was busy watching the car closely as I drove by because I had thought they had hit a deer.  I believe I kept watching the car in my rear view mirror because I can’t believe I wouldn’t have seen &#34;it&#34; sooner.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I rounded the 3rd curve, veering off from the Rustic Road, I looked straight ahead and there it was.  Straight in front of me, eye-height looking out my front windshield, the only way I can explain it was that I didn’t have to bend to see it above my car.  The object was just above tree height.  The object/row of lights appeared to be positioned over the abandoned farm area near the next curve.  I cannot believe the people in the house on the corner did not notice it.  There are only about 4 homes in that area of the marsh.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I saw a row of rectangular shaped lights that were illuminating the object above and below the lights but not the complete object.  It appeared to be circular in shape, maybe grayish in color.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first I thought and may have even said it aloud, &#34;Oh my goodness, do hot air balloons fly at night?&#34;  &#34;No, not with lights,&#34; I said.  It was that close to me at first, the ‘texture or surface’ of the object appeared to have the &#34;look&#34; of a hot air balloon or something similar to the :Airbus&#34; surface.  The big Wisconsin balloon flies low and close by in the summer sometimes, so that is why I thought it had a similar look to the surface of a balloon, but not colorful more of a matte gray. The illumination on the object from the lights reminded me of the haze around a streetlight when it is misting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> By this time, my mouth is wide open I am saying, &#34;Oh my God!&#34; over and over.  I’m sure I was barely going 10 mph but for the life of me I don’t know how I made it around the next curve without going off the road because I never took my eyes off the object,<n> <n><n> <n><n> Within seconds of first viewing the object, I could no longer see the object illuminated around the lights; all I could see is the row of vertically rectangular lights.  I assumed later that the object was moving from me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It appeared to be backing further away but off to the left of its original position.  The curve of the roads veers to the left and the object was still pretty much in front of me.  The lights were like vertical windows at night, framed by black darkness, I believe about 7 or 8 lights, and the &#34;row&#34; of lights was  slightly curved which seemed to support the circular shape I had first saw.  The sky was completely dark with the exception of these lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then all of a sudden the lights went out but not like someone had switched off a light switch but more like someone was pulling a curtain or drapery shut over each window, from my  right to left and then the lights were gone.  Right after they were gone a small flash appeared that looked exactly like the flashing lights of an aircraft flying at night except it only flashed once and then all I saw was complete darkness.  I kept watching in the area where I had last seen the lights to see if I would see movement or a shadow or something but I did not.  I kept driving slow and watching out the window to my left almost the entire way home.  I did notice a lot of jet-noise that night and also remembered hearing the jets flying at night the 2 nights previous to Nov. 16.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was strange because I met another car about ¾ mile on a straightaway in the marsh parked alongside the road with its lights on as well.  But I think this car would have been too far away to have seen it.  I am wondering if the first car that I had met parked alongside the road had seen it.  It was only about ¼ mile from where I saw the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The entire time I was driving, more like crawling while I am watching the lights/object   I am reaching in my purse for my phone to try to capture a photo.  Never did get it out.  But I kept staring at it to get a clear picture in my mind and immediately came home and drew what I saw.  At first I drew the row of lights with the light framing black rectangular darkness but when I also drew the row of lights with the darkness framing the vertically rectangular lights that appeared to be closer to what I saw.  I’ve scanned my drawings the first drawing is closer to what I remember.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I told my husband and my son when I got home.  They really didn’t react too much.  Later it was bothering me, I felt I should report what I had seen.  I did place a call to what I thought was the Green Lake County sheriffs dept but instead I had dialed the Green Lake City police dept.  As I explained it to him he kind of laughed, said he had not heard of any other reports but would mention it to the sheriff&#39;s dept if he spoke to someone.  He did say I could call them to report it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The next day I told a friend of mine at work of the sighting and he encouraged me to contact the UFO center.<n>

We would estimate it at a half mile long.  There were about 16-20 lights that were blinking.  They were in a nearly straight line.  We were traveling on Highway 89 towards Kanab and lost site of the lights at about Big Water.  The lights were traveling Northwest.   They did not rise or fall in elevation or change in distance between the individual lights.  We stopped the car at one point and could here no noise.  The lights were white, but I would say that at times there was an amber cast to some of them.  We started out watching them at 6pm on November 16, 2011 and followed them(traveled in the same general direction with them) for 40 minutes.  We finally lost them at Big Water.<n>

They disappeared behind our woods.  I parked the truck and ran to the outer edge of the woods to the west and could not see anything. Whatever it was must have headed north or northeast.   It was like a string of old fashioned white Christmas lights.  The string was in a east/west pattern traveling north.<n>

They appeared low in the sky and reminded us of stadium lights but in a horizontal pattern as I described.  We both asked, &#34;what is that?&#34; and they immediately went dark.  Within seconds, we stopped the car, turned off the engine and got out to listen.  There was no sound.  We expected a plane, helicopter or something, but it was silent.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is a rural, county road. There are no trees, etc. or other visual obstructions where we were.  The only other traffic was a truck 1/4 mile ahead of us that appeared oblivous to this.  There are no towers, city lights or nearby airport.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My husband and I have lived in this area for 30 years.  We are both retired teachers.  I am 51 and my husband is 62 and have never seen anything like this.  This is the first time I have ever reported something like this.<n>
11/16/11 17:40|Kayenta|AZ|Unknown|40 minutes|UFO lights near Kayenta, AZ|12/12/11|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/085/S85392.html|201|ndxe201111| UFO lights near Kayenta, AZ<n> <n><n> <n><n> On Wednesday, November 16th, 2011, at approximately 5:40p m in the town of Kayenta, Arizona 3 of my children and I were playing basketball outside on the drive way when we saw strange blinking lights in the Eastern sky from our position.  The temperature on that evening was about 40 degrees, not much of a breeze, no moon to show for, and the sun was about to set over the mesa in the west.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My oldest daughter was the first to see the lights and then my third oldest son and then my second oldest daughter. My oldest daughter and my son called my name to get my attention to look at the lights.  When I turned to look, I only saw a light indigo/purplish color sky with the North Star shining bright about ¼ up into the sky. I said, &#34;Where?&#34;  My kids pointed and said, &#34;Right there!&#34;  They were pointing eastwards just beneath the North Star.  I repositioned myself on top of the bed of my truck. I had to re-focus my attention against the darkening sky.  Then I saw the lights.  The lights were like lights on an airplane or helicopter only it wasn’t.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Aircraft lights was what came to my mind but how wide the lights made the object, changed that thought. There were about 15 blinking lights in a row (in a straight line pattern from our position).  Most of the lights were evenly placed from each other but on the left end there was a group of four lights that were close together (See small design below.  This design might change if copied and pasted).<n> <n><n> <n><n> .     .  .  .  .     .     .     .     .     .     .     .     .     .<n> <n><n> <n><n> The lights were white in color and against the background of the sky were no bigger or brighter than the stars. The blinking lights were irregular and all blinked at different times.  All the lights were permanently placed but moved as a whole, as if it belonged to an immense spacecraft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I would place the unidentified object approximately 25-30 miles wide.  The distance from light to light for a majority of the even placed lights was approximately 2 miles.  From our position the unidentified object was approximately 40-50 miles away, 3-4 miles high and moving slowly in a North Western direction.  My wife and I calculated these numbers after hours of discussing the event and looking over pictures through the internet and television in the following 2 days.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We could not see the outline or the unidentified object itself. We could see fog or somewhat looks like clouds beneath and surrounding the lights.  What was also strange about what we saw was that we could see the sky behind or through the blinking lights as if the object were transparent. I was thinking this object could not be of any aircraft on Earth. Not airplane, not helicopter, not hot air balloon, not weather balloons, or any unmanned drone. There was no sound coming from the object either.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At approximately 5:46pm I called my wife who was at the local grocery store working. I was outside with my kids observing the object in the East when I called her. I told her we see lights of a UFO. She said, “Where?!” I said, “Towards the East!” She said, “Wait!” That’s when she went outside to look for herself. She said, “Where is it at?!” I said, “Do you see the North Star?!” She said, “Yes!” I said, “Look just below it! There is a line of blinking lights! Do you see it?!” She said, “I can’t see it. I’m not good at looking at specific details”. I said, “Just look below the North Star. There is a line of blinking lights.” She said, “Yeah, yeah, yeah, I see it!” Then I said, “I recorded it on my phone. I got it on video”. When I checked my phone later that evening I couldn’t find the video. I discovered then that I didn’t actually record the sighting. I thought I pressed the record button but didn’t press it hard enough to initiate the recording.<n> <n><n> <n><n> While observing the unidentified object in the East with my kids, I called my brother, who lives in Mesa, Arizona, at approximately 5:48pm. I said, “We see lights of a UFO!” He said, “What? Where?” Then I explained to him exactly what I was seeing and what the UFO was doing. I asked my brother if he was near his computer. He said, “Yeah”. I said, “Look up the phone number where we can report UFO’s and call me back.” He said, “The National UFO Center or something?” I said, “Yeah.” At approximately 5:57pm I called the local Police Department to report the strange lights. I was outside with my kids when I made the call watching the unidentified object which was approximately in a North Eastern direction now. The dispatcher said, “Police Department.” I said, “Hi, I would like to report……is there a number where we can report strange objects…..cause…..this might sound kind of funny but I see….” The dispatcher said, “You mean the lights in the sky?” I said, “Yeah”. The dispatcher said, “We already got calls about that”. I said, “Oh, ok. Thank you”.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then at approximately 6:00pm I called my brother again. I returned back inside the house at this time. I asked him, “Did you find the number?” He said, “Yeah”. I wrote down the number to the NUFORC to report the event. I first reported it to the NUFORC at 6:04pm.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After reporting the incident, my kids and I stepped back outside into the night to check for the mysterious lights in the sky. The lights were now in a northern direction. At this time the night sky was clear. We could clearly see the stars and there were no longer any clouds or fog that we saw earlier when the object was located in the east. If there were traces of clouds or fog then the night sky hid it from our view.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My 3 kids and I observed the unidentified object, from start to finish, for about 40 minutes until it disappeared over the horizon of rocks north of Kayenta at approximately 6:20pm. After it disappeared over the horizon my wife arrived home from work.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At 6:23pm NUFORC called me back also wanting a written report of the event.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At approximately 6:25pm my wife, kids and I got into our car and drove north to Monument Valley, UT hoping to witness the strange lights again. In the next hour or so, all we could see was about 10 airplanes flying throughout the Eastern and Northern skies. With nothing else exciting to see we headed back home.<n>

My phone camera captured a round white orb to the right of the highway, just above the power lines.

This time it was white, and it was in a different spot. It slowly faded away, after that 2 more showed back up.  They were orange again one over the top of the other. one of them stayed lit for about 30 seconds and slowly faded away again.  I have never seen anything like this.  At first I thought it was flares, but flares fall, and they dont change colors.

I had just noticed a standard &#34;Shooting Star&#34; for comparison, which relative to this sighting typically have a more vertical trajectory path, are significantly faster [3 to 10 times than what I observed, by guestimate], and last a second oe less.  The object was traveling West to East PARALLEL TO THE GROUND AT HIGH [SUPERSONIC] SPEED but without Sonic Boom, nor any observed Noise, appearing to be BENEATH typical JETLINER CRUISING ALTITUDE [maybe ~2-3miles altitude], and in my clear view for seconds [3-5].  It appeared as an oval-elongated fireball, but with the suggestion of an underlying form. I noticed 2 concentrated light-like areas toward the front third, which I would guess to be either reflection off metallic substance, or concentrated &#34;Burning&#34; areas.  The Fire was relatively short - reminiscent of Rocket Exhaust, ovoid front to back.  It escaped my view behind an isolated tall tree, heading due East maybe within a couple miles from my local, and just disappeared, without evidence of Falling, nor continuing despite a clearing beyond the Tree[s].<n> <n><n> <n><n> Just days ago I heard [on Rachel Maddow MSNBC?], that a Russian Satellite had failed to Fire its &#34;After-Burners&#34; &amp; didn&#39;t make it into orbit, and if they failed to &#34;Fire It Up,&#34; it was due to return as &#34;Space Debris.&#34;  That would seem to be most consistent with my UFO, with the notation that it was traveling in what appeared to be a very stable path [almost deliberate], and consistently parallel to the ground.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke via telephone with this witness, and he sounded to us to be quite credible.  He is a medical professional.  The object was not the Russian satellite.  PD))<n>

It is by  a senior female of high reliability and standards yet she felt compelled to relate this observance to me because of it’s strangeness and visibility in the night sky.  She also wishes to remain anonymous  She took the dog out for it’s nightly walk at approx 945 pm EST.  her attention was drawn to the south-east sky by a commercial jet on landing approach to Newark Airport, the  sighting location is within the landing/takeoff patterns of Newark and she thought this was normal  However, in the clear night sky she observed a LARGE &#34;LIGHTED CROSS-HAIR&#34; being formed in the SSE sky, the rays of this cross were razor sharp, thin, white and seemed to emanate from an unknown source (not Ground based) and when they converged at a center point in the sky they all WINKED OUT  the same time , the process was repeated many times. The timing of the event was approx 10-15 secs with a brief interval between occurrences.  They repeated at least 8-10 times as she walked back into the house as  the cross-hair  rays were still being formed, extinguished, and formed again and again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> From her telling this to me at Thanksgiving  I took her out front of the house and she pointed out in the night  sky where this event happened, it was high over water approx 50-60 degrees off the horizon SSE,  and her statement of size was it was bigger than her hand held outstretched; it did not block it out.  Since I cannot pinpoint this exact date on that week of Nov 2011  it seems that this event was high in the clear night sky, stationary  and not of any terrestrial origin, advertising or aircraft production, it happened high over  coastal water in the sky over southern NY  but was viewed from Central NJ (Perth Amboy) location   Anybody else ever see this type of light show event here or other parts of the country?<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

It was dark; our speed was about 30 mph. coming down a hill.  Our location was 48.86 N and -122.64 W (Google map coordinates), in a very rural area with some houses scattered throughout the acreage.  I was on Olson Rd. in Ferndale, just south of Thornton Rd.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A small ball of light flew past our car, coming from the west and going east.  It was below street light level (if there were street lights, which there were not) and was similar looking to a falling star going sideways in front of us, with a slight glow following it.  It was hard to tell the size or the distance from our car and above the landscape.  It may have been 20-40 feet in front of us, moving quite fast and maybe the size of a softball?!<n> <n><n> <n><n> It happened so quickly that it almost didn’t register in my brain.  It didn’t occur to me to stop and watch it either.  After 3 or 4 seconds passed! , I asked my son, &#34;Did you just see that?&#34;   He said, &#34;Yeah.&#34;<n> <n><n> <n><n> I said, &#34;What do you think that was?&#34;  He said, &#34;I don’t know.&#34;<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am posting this now, because I just learned about you and a friend sent me a posting someone made in 2001 that was almost the exact same location and description I experienced.  I may not have ever brought it up with anyone if there had not been another person with me that saw the same thing.  I probably would not have trusted what I saw.<n>

Bright orange light<n> <n><n> <n><n> Date: Thursday, Nov 17, 2011 at 3 pm Subject: November 15, 2011 Sightings of two UFOs To: ufocenter.com   To: UFO Center Re: Sighting of Two UFOs at about 7:40 pm pacific time Location: From home located at far west end of Skamania County; a Second seen about a minute later was in east Clark County  Address:  XXX Huckins-Buhman Road, Washougal, WA 98671  I was outside at about 7:30 pm pacific time on Nov. 15, 2011.  I looked into a clear north sky.  My location was about 30 miles south of Mt. St Helens.  My elevation was about 500 ft above sea level. The skies are relatively free of light-pollution from Portland, OR, Portland is about 45 line-of-sight miles away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At about 7:40 pm I was gazing intently to the north sky and at the instant of sighting I thought I was seeing a meteor.  In the next instant I could see the object was fairly close to me and at a distance close to the earth.  It could have been 2,000 to 3,000 feet high, traveling west-to-east and in the distance only about 1-2 miles away.  My head was raised only about 15-20 degrees to place it in the center of my personal viewing window.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The shape was best described as a modern fishing bobber. I thought first to describe it as an onion, sis kabob or giant child’s toy--a top.  But its symmetry and aerodynamic shape made the fishing bobber or onion pretty good descriptors.  The front had a large diameter, perhaps about the diameter of an executive jet—10-12 ft.  The diameter of the object decreased gradually if one were to measure from the maximum diameter at the front and then moving toward the rear of the object, the diameter gradually decreased to a dimension of a foot or less.  However, there was also a long cylindrical rod which looked to be a foot in diameter, or somewhat less; the rod extended from the front of the object by about 5 or 6 ft, passed symmetrically through the entire body of the object and extended about 10 feet beyond the end of the bobber-shaped part.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The bobber-shaped part was a bright pumpkin orange  It looked like the entire object was engulfed in an orange flame. The flame did NOT burn as a liquid fuel with flames extending---there was a flame but more like the metal of the skin was on fire or just orange-hot.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The speed was subsonic-probably 400-500 mph.  I watched it in clear sky for about 2-3 seconds; then it sped into fir trees at a higher altitude on the hill; the trees are about 150 ft high.  But as I watched, it appeared in a second &#34;window&#34; through the trees for an instant and then out of sight. Its trajectory appeared very much in accordance Newtonian laws of motion-just a gravity-controlled descent with no obvious deviations---which might have been caused, says, by steering.  All is very quiet here and I listened intently to hear a crash; I heard no sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The country-side is familiar to me.  I would say that it impacted on a flat-topped hill, called Bear Prairie which is north of me; the point of impact would have been about 2-3 miles from me. To give you a latitude and longitude, I would say it crashed near the north end of a short road, called Bear Prairie Road and at its end and intersection with Skye Road.  These places should be easily identifiable on a good map of this area.  If my estimates are way off, it might have traveled as far as the valley of the North Fork of the Washougal River, Bob’s Mountain, but certainly not beyond Silver Star Mountain (5,000 ft in elevation)  and about 20 miles away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This appears to have been the routine death of a satellite or other man-made object falling from orbit.  The only really curious thing was that about half a minute later I saw a 2nd orange-glowing object which was traveling at about the same speed, but it was 6-7 miles away to the west of me.  It was traveling in pretty much the opposite direction---from the east to the southwest toward the hills that rise up north and above downtown Washougal or Camas.  Or if it was traveling in the gap in the hills which rise to the north of both towns, it might have landed in one of the cities, the Columbia River or in Northeastern Portland, perhaps even as far as the Portland airport.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Probably not a very exciting entry into your log of UFO sightings, but interesting for the record and probably of interest to the Air Force that probably likes to keep track of where satellites that fall to earth.<n>

The lights went out as fast they they lit up -again in a line formation.  The line was slanted and the illumination started at the bottom of the formation.   It was similar to the sightings posted on 11/17/08 in the Oshkosh/Omro area of Wisconsin.  I did note a separate aircraft which appeared like a regular &#34;airplane&#34; that flew just below this line of light formation.  The &#34;airplane&#34; was traveling to the west.   These were 2 separate entities - the &#34;line of lights&#34; was not part of the airplane.  I also had spotted a &#34;falling star&#34; near the area about 20 minutes prior to this sighting.<n>

Observed was a reddish/orange light approaching from the East. The light appeared to be moving fast over the Capital Hill/First Hill neighborhood and may have been 1000 to 2000 ft in elevation.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As the light approached closer it appeared to slow down and seemed very large.  The light started to shift towards the north and appeared to get smaller.  It appeared to climb in elevation and started moving at a faster rate.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The light disappeared and there was a flash of light that lasted a millisecond.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The normal route for air traffic to Sea-Tac International Airport was an approach from the North to the South.

I couldn&#39;t tell very well since it went buy so fast, but I saw a dark grayish hue around the light, maybe it was a disk, but I&#39;m not sure.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object was maybe give or take 2000ft above and went buy faster than a jet fighter.

It was floating around the way a helium balloon would with a consistent medium brightness, about 250m up.  Then, it stopped moving and elevated as an commercial airplane approached.  As the two got closer the mysterious light dimmed.  When it became almost invisible in the night sky, it flashed white, then disappeared.<n>
11/14/11 18:05|Lafayette|IA|Light|15 seconds approx.|Stationary High-Magnitude Light Dimming Out|12/12/11|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/085/S85326.html|234|ndxe201111| Stationary High-Magnitude Light Dimming Out<n> <n><n> <n><n> Returning home from a long bike ride shortly after the fall of night I was walking my bike in an open area along a bike path in the countryside --about 7 miles north of Cedar Rapids -- with open farm fields to my right &amp; left when I noticed a striking pairing of objects.  Both objects were stationary and appeared to be stars at first, although I wondered if one might be a planet.  They were perhaps 2 to 5 degrees apart (uncertain exactly but not right next to each other).  In retrospect 24 hours later I would hazard two finger widths apart.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Jupiter was visible about 50 degrees to the left of the pair and at roughly the same height above the horizon.  My thought was it might be something that would be mentionable in a current astronomical magazine due to the strikingness of the combination.  Only minutes to moments before, I was checking out 3 high-flying aircraft in the northern sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had been out at night on my bike frequently all throughout this year and it must have seemed unfamiliar enough to me to zero-in on it so quickly when I first looked in another direction.  The upper object was the brightest shining with almost approximately the same magnitude as Jupiter (although it seemed a bit smaller than Jupiter).  The lower object was not especially exceptional other than possibly being a brighter star for a lower altitude.  Both objects appeared whitish.  Jupiter appeared to be about 25 to 30 degrees above the horizon incidentally.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Muddling the matter were high and elongated thin cirrus clouds nearing the pair.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Anyway as I was looking at the two the brighter one dimmed into nothingness quite abruptly (but it did breathtakingly dim as it wasn’t quite instantaneous).  This occurred before any obscuring by clouds [emphasis: certainty].<n> <n><n> <n><n> The puzzling aspect however was that it appeared absolutely stationary and not moving like a satellite would be moving out of solar glare.  Once years ago I viewed the ISS at Kennedy Space Center and that seemed to travel at a fair pace across the sky, though I wonder now how it would appear at the very end of visibility.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I noted the time via my cell phone at 18:05 hours.  I then resumed riding and as best as possible given conditions continued to observe  that area of the sky for almost 30 minutes but high and thin clouds had more or less covered that region of the sky preventing visibility in that region.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was unable to get a clear fix on the second object which might have dimmed out soon after the first one or it may have been a star slowly masked by the cloud cover.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

There was definitely a structure there but i could not make anything out.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I continued to stare in the same location in shock, another one came, on the same north path.  It did not make any noise at all.  As a matter of fact, unless you were staring in the location that I was it would definitely have been missed.  Hopefully someone sees the same thing.<n>

I saw an oval object with lights all around it hovering on top of the Macy&#39;s at the Metro North Mall by 169 highway.  It was stopped there and not moving for about 2 minutes, then took off heading towards Southwest.  It was going very fast but it went from being really low to up.<n>
11/14/11 15:08|Wautoma|WI|Fireball|15 minutes|Four orange fireballs seen over Wautoma, WI|12/12/11|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/085/S85323.html|237|ndxe201111| Four orange fireballs seen over Wautoma, WI<n> <n><n> <n><n> At dusk on November 14, 2011, just south of Wautoma, WI, I was leaving my bowhunting tree stand and walking towards my car.  As I looked up into the darkening sky I saw 4 bright orangish, yellow fireballs in a diamond formation.<n> <n><n> <n><n> These flashes of light all appeared very low in the sky.  Immediately they got much brighter and larger but stayed in the same general position for a second or two.  They then disappeared as quickly as they had appeared.  The light seemed to fade out and slightly upwards and the scene was over in 3 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About 20 seconds later as I was staring dumbfounded at the sky wondering where they went, 2 fighter jets came flying in to the exact vicinity where the ufo&#39;s disappeared.  They were very high and not identifiable to the visible eye as fighter jets but the roar of the engines were so loud and the speed at which they traveled was so fast there is no question that is what they were.  These 2 jets then began combing the sky, from the east towards the west, and back and forth for the next 30 minutes, at least.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Once I realized they were fighter jets searching for the ufo&#39;s I called my hunting partner who was 7 miles away from my position.  I knew nobody would believe me so I wanted my cynical friend to see the jets.  Well we were talking on the phone and he heard and spied the jets too.  Within another minute or two both of us identified 3 orange fireballs, now much further to the west.  From my location they were in a line and they once again only appeared for a few seconds, brightened, and then quickly faded away.  My friend counted 3 also and was saying that there was another orange fireball, the fourth, more directly above him.  I could not see that one.  However, the fighter jets were combing the sky where they disappeared, they were clearly tracking and trying to follow the ufos.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was also Monday night football and the Packers were playing the Vikings at 7:30 PM.  They were supposed to have a fighter jet flyover before the game, which never happened, my brothers were at the game and no jets did the pre game flyover, they were all busy with the ufos.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About 8:30 PM, we were watching the packer game in the cabin.  I thought I could hear more fighter jets and looked out the window.  Both of us saw another orange globe of light west of Wautoma that disappeared seconds after seeing it.  I went outside and could see the flashing lights and hear the roar of two jets that were still combing the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am 26 years old, college educated at UW-La Crosse and an avid outdoor enthusiast.  I am open to the possibilites of extra terrestrials and this confirmed it.  Why else would fighter jets be racing across the central Wisconsin sky and not performing at the packer/viking monday night football game which is one of the biggest events of Wisconsin&#39;s year?<n>

As I was writing two small red lights caught my eye not because there&#39;s always air traffic from local airports but they started with a small but bright flash from 1-2 miles away.  Heading straight for me, they made a smooth turn in the flight path towards the airport.  Meanwhile there was a small plane close ahead but a little lower so I used that as a measure for the spheres when they were closest to me. They were big, at least 3or4 small planes in height stacked up. The second one was identical,seemed independent and followed close behind the first.  They maintained the same speed as the plane ahead,and made no sound.  As the plane went to land, they kept going making a turn.  At that point I was hoping to see there opposite sides but they started to shrink in size and went out like a old tv set would shut off when the picture turns into a line, then a dot, then disappears but very slow.  They had beautiful red coloring to them but a different red than I have seen.<n>

My dog freaked out.   At the same time a friend who lives 15 miles away witnessed this same light and his dog freaked out aswell.   I was wondering if anyone else noticed this.  I have never seen a UFO and don&#39;t nessasarly beleive in them, but I can not think of another explaination.   My girlfriend has witnessed a similar occurance.

The objects were stationary in a standard triangle formation.  After about 45 seconds they began to move and seemed to &#34;stack&#34; one on the other with visible distance between them.  They then began moving North and upward.  The top craft released one small, broad yellow burst.  Once they began moving they were out of sight in about 30 seconds.<n>

It was a clear night and I was looking at the stars when I witnessed an unidentified flying object.  The closest object I can say it was shaped like was a bullet.  It glowed bluish-white and moved very quickly in a direct line north to south for about 2 seconds prior to vanishing before reaching the horizon.  I was walking with my girlfriend and her mother but I was the only one that witnessed it that I&#39;m aware of.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I figured it was a paper lantern that someone had let go but then all of a sudden it took a sharp turn to the right, probably about 60 degrees or so and started going a lot faster than it had previously.  We pulled off to the side of the road and I rolled down my window and shut the car off and I heard this roaring engine, completely different then how a plane, helicopter, or even jet would sound.  It was unlike anything either of us had seen before.  We turned the car around in a parking lot to get a picture of it and as soon as we got it turned around it disappeared behind clouds and didn’t reappear.<n>

I-93N heads almost due east at this point and the light was traveling in approximately the same direction.  The light seemed like it wasn&#39;t too high.  I&#39;ll estimate it was maybe less than a mile in the air although it is hard to say.  The light suddenly became not visible before it made it over the horizon or flew far enough away to not be seen.  Conditions were clear and there were no fog or clouds which could have obscured it.  There was at least a few other cars on the highway and I&#39;m wondering if anyone else may have noticed it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides little contact information.

Reds, blues, other colors, and flexible?  Silent. LAX also uses the same path 24/7.

Larger than a small plane, yet you could see through it!. It passed where the LAX airport was and continued (north of airport) travling east fast as a jet!

I am currently working as an IT professional.  I am a qualified Mechanical Engineer with a post graduate degree in Automobile Engineering.  It was a full moon, in an otherwise dark sky.  Not many stars were visible since there is considerable light pollution in Delhi.  I was testing my new Binoculars (80 X 80, 32M at 1000M) to see the moon in detail.  Then I turned to spot a few stars which were not very clear to naked eye.  Suddenly I saw something, which I initially thought to be a flock of migratory birds, through naked eye, which seem to be glowing, or more precisely, were illuminated by a constant, dim, yellow light.  Instantly I realized that there are no birds that produce photoluminescence, hence I took a close look with my binoculars.  I seemed like a formation of some flying objects, shape of individual object was not clear.  The formation was triangular, and seem to distort a bit as it flew through the sky.  Also, the formation was flying at considerable speed, as I have seen aircraft flying though same sky occasionally, at comparable speeds.<n>

He banged on the window from outside (I was in the living room)to get me to come look. I got outside and he told me to come quick and was having me look in the sky for a light he saw. It was gone. I thought he was funny and I laughed it off. I &#34;yea&#39;d&#34;  him and went back inside.<n> <n><n> <n><n> He came in a few minutes after, telling me he was sure it was not an airplane and going on and on about the glowing ball in the sky. I continued to watch tv with our son and my husband went back outside. A few minutes after, he banged frantically on the window again, for which we (myself and my 7 year old) both went out the front door to see this thing my husband was talking about.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am not sure what I saw. It was a ball, flying across the sky, unlike anything I have seen before.  It was red-ish, orange-ish-yellow-ish (hard to explain... kind of like a ball of fire. It was not falling from the sky. It was flying.  I would have thought that it were a plane or helicopter with some red lighting or something... but there was no sound whatsoever.  That was something my husband kept saying.... what the hell is that... and listen.... there isn&#39;t a sound.  It was not windy or raining... it was dark, but not black out (we had street lights and so on).  I wouldn&#39;t not have believed it if I hadn&#39;t seen it.  I would have thought it was a completely explainable aircraft, had I not seen it myself.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My husband was glad I saw the second one, because I apparently looked at him as though he were a little off or something.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am THE LAST person who you would think you would hear this from.  But I know what I saw was not something usual. If I found out there were some special thing going on at the nearby airport (PEASE, which is a tiny airport, not used for commercial flights), I might have dismissed it.  We have had air shows there before.  But there is nothing going on there that I can find.   And no reports on meteors or any other odd things in our area.  Someone else HAD to have seen it.   I checked the police logs online.  I also checked the local weather center and have been looking for a logical explanation. I have not yet found anything.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.  PD))<n>

To the south I noted a light coming towards me heading north to cross the highway.  It caught my eye because the leading light on this craft was a pale-blue, or almost aqua in color and did not flash.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I watched it start to pass over me I noticed only a rear light, which I can only describe as a dull dirty white glow.  It was difficult to make out the shape of the object because of the time of day, it was twilight, and the sun had gone down below the horizon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I thought that it might be a helicopter and I expected to see that shape, but that is not the impression I got of it from its silhouette.  The object was not moving fast and seemed very low, if I had to guess, I would say that it was maybe 500 feet above the ground and travelling at approximately 100 mph.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In closing, I spotted this object coming from the South, heading North and it seemed to be passing slightly west of Milford, Nebraska.  There were no flashing lights, as one would expect to see from an FAA aircraft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> If you have any answers as to what this may have been, I would truly appreciate it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have never seen anything that would make me report it, but this object was extraordinary to me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thank You Sincerely<n>

I got the binoculars out and looked at the 3 objects that were closer as the others were too far.  They looked like pure clean white cone like jelly clouds! They drifted from left to right very slowly and were wobbly!  I would guess they must have been approx. 2,5 meters high and 1,5 meters across.  Very strange!  Then after drifting from left to right at the same height, they moved forward above and over my house until eventually i had to leave for work!

At 11:15 PM, as I was near the border of Missouri and Arkansas, I happened to notice how clear the sky was from my windshield.  I was attracted to the sky mostly due to the number of stars that were so visible.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I turned to my driver side window to get a better look and immediately saw three bright lights that looked like large stars in a V formation.  It was clear right away that they were moving in my direction and that they were in our skies as opposed to out in space with the rest of the stars.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I’ve seen many planes, helicopters and blimps in the sky and could easily tell that this was not what I was seeing.  There were no blinking lights on these objects; they were just balls of light.  There was kind of an excitement as I thought I may be looking at UFO’s.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had to break my concentration from what I was seeing so that I could watch the highway for a few seconds. The break in concentration was enough to bring me back to reality and I thought that when I looked back I would recognize that they were just airplanes.  When I went back for my next look they were closer and I started to notice other really small lights in a cluster around the original three balls of light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I noticed how many lights were actually in the sky I thought that I had to be seeing traffic from an airport.  With this in mind I noticed that none of the lights were landing or taking off.  They were all still moving in my direction as if they were going to cross over the highway.  They were coming from the East and moving West as I was traveling South on the highway.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About this time, I thought I have to get a picture of this.  I started rolling my driver side window down, steered with my knee and was switching my cell phone to camera with my right hand.  I pointed the phone in the direction of the lights, checked the screen and then snapped a picture.  I didn’t really expect to catch anything, but I checked anyway and noticed I caught three lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Now, the lights were pretty far over my left shoulder and it was hard to watch them as I was driving.  I started to roll my window up and saw a helicopter flying low to the ground, parallel to the highway, and in the direction of the lights.  I tried to catch the lights in my rear view mirror, but was unable to find them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At this point I was pretty excited and decided to send the picture to a friend and post it to Facebook.  The next couple of hundred miles I was overwhelmed with thoughts and questions and it was all I could think about.  I stopped for the night in Little Rock and immediately opened the picture on my computer so that I could zoom in on it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was shocked to find a triangle shape made of lights, a green glowing disc, and another light that was cut off because it was out of the frame.  After really examining the green object I noticed that it was reflecting light from above rather than glowing.  You can really see this because the structure of the object is casting shadows.  There are bumps that stick out on the edges and there is a dome exactly centered.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I guess I caught the object as well of a trace of the object because of my shutter speed.  I don’t know much about photography so I’m not sure what would cause the object and trace to appear the way they do. I’d guess it would have something to do with the motion or speed that the object was moving.  I didn’t actually see the green object with my own eyes; I only saw different size and colors balls of light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After checking out the image, I Googled &#34;Memphis UFO&#34; to see if anyone else had seen the same thing.  It didn’t take long before I found MUFON.  I emailed my picture to the director; I had no idea what else to do with it at the time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Since I’ve had this sighting it’s become a huge part of my life.  The last two months I’ve been obsessed with UFO’s and have watched every documentary, searched the internet, and spent countless hours staring into the sky.  I’ve met other people (young and old) who have witnessed similar things and noticed that it became a major part of their lives as well.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I know that we cannot add contact information into the report, but I would love to speak with anyone who has seen something like this.  I’m not sure if there is a way for you to contact me, but if so please do.<n>

We turned into a neighborhood and stopped in an empty culdasac.  We thought it was stationary for the first 45-70 seconds, then realized after it dimmed slightly that it was moving and very fast.  Turned around to go opposite way and another one was directly behind us and also moving very fast.  We continued down the road the way we were originally heading and the first one got super bright again and crossed over the road but farther up than us and disappeared.  The other one looked like it had changed shapes and resembled a very small yellow cresent moon.  And the moon it  self was almost full. we got home stood out in the driveway and realized there were like 10-15 planes and jets all over the skies going back and forth in the direction we saw these things.  I do not believe that was a coincedence.<n>

Not being very good with direction, I can just say as I was facing the sky, the full moon was just starting to be visible among the tree tops, to the left.  I saw four pulsating orbs (reddish-orange in color) -- for lack of a better word -- in a rectangular formation, quite spread out.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They were moving very slowly from right to left and faded away as they got to the point where the moon was just becoming visible (about 6:05 p.m.)  As I continued watching, one-by-one orbs were &#34;launching&#34; from the same point at the horizon line and traveling, again, from right to left.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At this point, none of them were in a formation, but just kind of slowly traveled until they faded away.  I would guess there were about 15 of them.  Luckily, I was able to get my neighbor to come out and she observed the same thing (with the exception of the first rectangular formation).  I would guess the whole episode lasted appr! oximately 5-10 minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am a 54-yr-old woman with a steady job, very educated and intelligent.

Looking out the front windshield at the 10 o’clock angle I saw an odd shaped silver object in the clear cloudless sky.  It was a bright reflective silver and I kept looking at it as it shrank and became a small dot and then disappeared.  I pulled the car over and got out and continued to scan the sky and there was nothing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have been a nurse for 30 years and my background is science.  Last year I saw my first UFO and I questioned what I saw, I evaluated everything until I could no longer deny what I had seen.  I consider myself fortunate to have had another opportunity and glad that this time I could keep my eye on the object until it disappeared.<n>

Each moving independently of each other at a constant speed (about the speed you would expect an aircraft would fly in the city) and in slightly different northerly path.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The lights appeared low enough that if they were aircraft an engine would be heard, but they were silent.  Once the first two had flown far enough north to start to dim, another light was seen moving from south to north along the same line, about a minute later another, and then another minute later, another light.  All were watched to the point of them being far enough north that they dimmed and could no longer be seen.  I have never seen lights of this intensity or color in my life.<n>

It slowly moved above the treeline for about 100 ft, before it seemed to take a turn towards an area of the hill where Interstate 81 is located.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Basically that sums it up.  I stayed awake for maybe a half hour afterwards, but it did not reappear.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A little about myself- I was never a skeptic, however I had never seen a object like this.

I thought maybe they were just balloons or something.  I took another look and realized just how far away they were and then one started to circle the other in a clockwise motion.  After circling a few times they seemed to attach themselves to one another and we just watched until we could no longer see them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> These objects did not emit light and I believe the only reason we could see them was because of the city lights and the full moon.<n>

I was on second floor, looked out and up my window.  I saw the underbelly of a flying craft that covered the complete view above me. I saw two distinct round red lights adjacent to each side underneath.  I followed flying object as it went over the pacific.  It seemed either round or oval shaped, not sure.  I saw big red and white lights blinking. The entire view was huge compared to the normal plane lights I usually see.  The under belly was metalic, minus the big red lights.  But it was hard to make out everything under there as it was such a surprise to me to be experiencing this.<n>

I look up to what they are pointing at and I see, what appears to be a triangle shaped object with white lights on each vertex.  In the center of the triangle three red alternating lights were blinking.  As the craft moved, it made no sound, so I immediately ruled out it was a helicopter or a small aircraft.  As it descended closer to the tree line, it reflected the light of a street lamp and the shape was different than from when I initially saw it.  The craft almost resembled a triangular boomerang.  Then it moved over the trees and disappeared into thin air.  Thinking I was crazy and sleep deprived, I drove on and continued into my neighborhood.  Nonetheless, I look up out of my driver’s side window and I see the lights of the craft right above the tree line.  I slow down my car and roll down my window to double check if it was a helicopter.  The craft the completely silent also seemed to &#34;hover&#34; and slow down when I did. I turned a corner and it followed me briefly for approximately 50 yards.  That’s when I looked at the road for split second to make sure I wasn’t going to hit anything and when I looked up the craft was way off in front of me probably a half to a quarter mile away.  I continued watching it until the trees blocked my view.  As I got home, I got out of my car and looked for it in my driveway since my house is at a slightly higher elevation than the street.  The u.f.o was gone.  This sighting freaked me out, and I know I’m not crazy, but I know what I saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

It was cloudy and had just stopped raining.  I noticed two very yellow lights perhaps 3/4 of the way up the sky to the northwest.  These lights were almost a lemon yellow.  Very peculiar and odd looking.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I stood there looking at them while my tank was filling up when they started moving apart.  First one started moving to the Northeast.  A second or two later the other started moving West.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The one moving Northeast continued down to about halfway up the sky when it rapidly vanished.  I&#39;m not sure if it went into the clouds or just turned off.  It didn&#39;t jut blink off but faded out over about 1/2 second.  The one moving West disappeared behind the gas station and I lost sight of it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I would guess the whole episode lasted about 15-20 seconds but I wasn&#39;t checking my watch so I can&#39;t be sure.  I wasn&#39;t frightened.  Just transfixed and curious.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.  PD))<n>

I-26 and was near exit 104 (Piney Grove) when I saw what I thought was a low flying plane headed East, almost directly over the road but slightly South of the road.  It was dark outside and the craft had several white lights (4?) underneath that blinked on and off about every 1 or 1.5 seconds.  It was flying very low and slow and as it approached and flew overhead I looked up twice and saw that it was circular in shape. I thought perhaps it was foggy outside and that the glow from the lights made the craft appear circular (it had been very foggy on a prior night, but it actually was clear this night). I am not sure if it generated any sound as I had the radio on, but certainly there was no loud engine sound.  I wanted to turn around to follow the craft, but I had just passed an exit.  I thought it had the shape of a sort of metallic jellyfish but without any tendrils.   I could not locate any media accounts of this sighting, so maybe i! t was a plane after all.<n>

I thought it was a plane or a street light or something.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then we pull up to the next intersection and he points it out again.  This time I see a vertical line of four lights.  One was red.  We turn onto the street where the church is off of and we get a better look at it and notice that it’s triangular shaped.  And the red light was in the middle.  And we also notice that it’s spinning slowly and moving.  We were basically following it though the parking lot of the church until we parked at one end of the parking lot.  The object was spinning slowly as it moved across the sky at about 30 or 40 mph.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We get out of the car and watch it continue moving in the same direction (East) until it was too far away to see.

It is a very clear Night no cloud cover.  We noticed a large craft flying low that changed directions and tilted to fly towards where we were standing in front of the yard on the other side of the Road.  We questioned why it was so bright and low.  We also heard nothing that sounded like jets or planes.  As the craft reached towards the road we noticed 3 distinct white lights on each corner and a flashing red light on top of the craft and the craft was approx. 5000 ft up which is not normal for planes that large to fly in this residential/rural area.  It then flew over us silently tilted once again to make a faint turn and realized it was an isosceles triangle.  It slowly flew past and above us down Governors Bridge Rd towards route 50. It was so clear and unbelievable that we witnessed this craft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I ran inside quickly to get my phone to take pictures b! ut it had flew off and didn&#39;t return.<n>

I turned to the west to view the sunset for a minute and when I turned back around the moon was gone.  The sky was clear - save for a few wispy clouds.  I was equally astonished to notice that the time was 4:40, and the date was 11-8-11, also significant as these are Cardinal numbers.  And it wasn&#39;t until 4:44 that I was able to identify the moon again.  The only explanation I can think of is that the &#34;asteroid&#34; blocked the moon from view.  Four years ago on 4/15 at 10:10 I filmed a waxing crescent moon which became partially obscured by a cigar shaped shadow (vertical) which began its trajectory in the center and moved up at an angle, exiting the tip of the north side of the waxing crescent.  George Noory reported that a small asteroid was a &#34;near miss.&#34;  Shortly thereafter NASA reported they were no longer allowing astronomers and universities to view incoming photographs from their satellite images simultaneously upon arrival.  I hope this information has been useful.<n>

There was absolutely no sound from it at any point. In all my years I have never seen something like this before.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was no shape of the object other than a light. From memory, I have to lean toward a white light but I cannot be sure. It may have been yellow, but the color would be no other color other than white or yellow. Like said though, from memory I aim towards a white light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am able to write this information clearly, other than the color of light, because I had written to my friend by email as to the event that took place, so months later now I am reporting this event that took place since I was able to come across this site.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thank you.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

The dog saw it too and we both looked up to see a very large object, or group of objects, overhead.  It was very similar to a flock of geese, but the V was inverted as it was moving forward, and one leg of the V was curved.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It felt to be fairly low in the sky.  I could see individual darker objects, evenly spaced, which made up the V or were positioned along the perimeter and no lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There were no wings flapping or noise, and if it had been geese the size of the dark objects would have allowed me to see necks and wings.  It was moving very quickly overhead.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It disappeared before you would have reasonably expected to no longer be able to see it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was a very unusual sighting, unlike anything I have ever seen before.<n>

It was a breezy afternoon...The sky was a beautiful pink and as I was enjoying the view, I noticed in the distance coming from the southeast, what I believed was a balloon someone let go. I even called out to my son to look at the balloon!  But then I thought it was too high.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I continued to watch it, I realized it was not at all a balloon as it never weaved. It was a simple black, what appeared flat looking circle. Seemed to travel as fast as a jet may.  There were no lights or ridges on it. It was like seeing a black polkadot cross the sky above me. It disappeared heading northwest.  I was so mesmerized by it that I did not dare run in to get a camera, I was afraid to lose track of it.   I wish I would have.<n>

Appeared to be approximately 500 feet in the air, separated by about 50 to 75 feet, moving slowly for first 15 seconds, then speeding off faster behind the tree line. No sounds of jet or prop engine noise despite being so close to my location. I immediately turned on the police scanner to determine if there were any aircraft over the town or on approach to the local airport (Wilmington International). No aircraft traffic reported inbound, outbound or in the greater Wilmington (NC) area at the time.  Verified the radio traffic at the airport with a call to another amateur radio operator and also confirmed with the airport&#39;s arrival/departures website.<n>

We got out of the car and the lights split apart, 4 crafts flew above as a very low speeds and altitude.  They were all quiet with very little sound.  They were flying towards Marfa Texas, straight towards the Marfa lights.  They all began to circle back around to the left back to the direction they came from when a 5th craft began flying directly above us.  It was a triangle with one red and white light on each side and a very bright white light in the front, almost like headlights.  After turning they all went toward Fort Davis.<n>

Seen in broad daylight then became invisible<n> <n><n> <n><n> The sighting happened on route 33 just outside of lancaster ohio. a silver disk hovered about 100ft off the ground right off the highway just before 9 am. i rolled down my window to get a better look at and i saw that it had a bright white illuminated rim and appeared to have a smooth silver bottom with deep segmented indents which makes it difficult to determine if the entire craft was spinning or if the bottom was spinning or changing shape independently. it had a gold or orange tint to the top part and I have to say the bottom metal part was far more shiny than any other metal i have ever seen.I am unsure if the craft was moving or stationary because my car was in motion but it seemed to move 20ft in my direction then it dissapeared. there was no audible noise accompanied with it. when it dissapeared it became transparent. it did not seem to &#34;go&#34; anywhere<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

It sounded like a vuvuzela.  I don’t think the sound came from the craft but it made me look outside (it was a very clear night no clouds in the sky).  When I looked outside I noticed something above the horizon just a small ball of light maybe a couple miles away.  It was blinking different colors changing from red to blue to green sometimes it stayed a solid white light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first I thought it was an airplane, but I noticed it wasn’t moving.  I watched the craft for 15 minutes and I got up so I could write down what I saw.  I was not exactly sure what I was looking at.  When I returned and looked back out of my window the object was gone.  I was certain at that point that I just witnessed a U.F.O. and needed to report it immediately.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thank you for your time and I hope this helps someone<n>

They both were hovering in practically broad daylight when we first saw them.  We could not understand why no one else could not see them, because even though they looked like stars to the naked eye, they were both moving, or hovering in the air.  Fast forward to 11 p.m. that night, and we were outside of my house, and sure enough, we caught a glimpse of apparently the same craft, but this time it was just one.  I swear that it looked just like a start moving, and I brought out my telescope and looked and looked and looked trying to see if I could make out anything besides a bright star looking object that was hovering.  I could not, and slowly from the north east it hovered until right over the mountain range by my house, and slowly hovered down disappearing from sight down into the mountain range. Scared us to death.  Hope someone else saw this! same phenomenon last night.  This is NOT A FAKE SIGHTING. ill put my reputation on it.<n>

Straight ahead, I noticed a white light moving horizontally, from west to north, just above the tree line.  I thought it odd that it was so low and close, yet I heard no noise.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My view was partially blocked by a few leafless trees, so I could not be sure if the light was steady or blinking.  It moved with a steady velocity, neither slowing nor speeding up.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was moving towards dense forest, and would soon be blocked from my vision, so I walked down my driveway to observe for as long as possible.  I watched it until I could no longer see it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Oddly enough, I did also see a shooting star just west of the light, while i was standing in my driveway.  This was an interesting comparison to me, because what I&#39;m reporting was definitely not a meteor.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I do live about 30 miles from an airport which use to be the site of an air force base and also about 10 miles from a smaller airport.  I have seen every sort of aircraft imaginable, but nothing like this.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I do not consider myself a UFO buff, nor am I the type to seek out sightings or contact.  I felt the need to report this because it was so odd, low, close and soundless.<n>

11/6/11 19:00|Frankfort|KY|Chevron|2 hours|Observed two objects with pulsating lights that changed positions, 4 additional objects released.  ((NUFORC Note:  Capella?  PD))|12/12/11|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/085/S85191.html|345|ndxe201111| Observed two objects with pulsating lights that changed positions, 4 additional objects released from these<n> <n><n> <n><n> On the evening of Sunday, November 6, 2011, at 7:00PM EST my wife was outside our home (which is 3 miles southwest of Frankfort, Kentucky).  She noticed a bright pulsating light to the north-northeast.  I went outside and immediately noticed the object, which was about 40 to 45 degrees above the horizon and appeared to be hovering over downtown Frankfort, Kentucky.  Object was noticeably brighter than stars in the sky.  Weather was clear at the time, no clouds noticed in the area.  When I first saw it, there appeared to be two smaller red pulsating objects circling below it, then these disappeared.  The main  Object appeared to occasionally give off a flash of white light, kind of like a photography flash bulb.  Object was hovering at high altitude, much higher than the helicopter traffic we often see in this area.  It did not emit any noise.   Object moved up and down very rapidly but remained fixed over the same area around 7:15pm.  I am estimating it was 3-5 mi! les away, guessing in the area of the intersection of highways US-127 and US-421, this would be on the north side of Frankfort, KY.  We observed this until 7:30pm and went back inside.  I went back out at 8:00PM, the object was still in the sky in about the same position as before.  At 8:15pm, Object also appeared to fall suddenly dropping maybe 5 degrees on the horizon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At this point, we saw 3 small but very bright red lights dropping down out of the main object one right after the other.  Two of these began heading due west at slow speed.  The third red light remained hovering below the main object, then at very high speed moved towards the other two red pulsating lights.  They then moved into a triangular formation and headed off due west at slow speed.  At this point, I went inside and got a set of binoculars, through the binoculars I could see that each of the red lights was actually 3 pulsating red lights in a V or chevron type shape.  Hard to tell size but definitely! in a V shape and flying in formation.  The red objects did no! t emit a ny sound.  At 8:20pm we noticed a similar object to the east had appeared also with the same pulsating green, red, yellow lights. Then about 8:25pm we saw the eastern object drop suddenly in altitude and stop. Suddenly the eastern rotating object dropped a single red flashing light...through the binoculars it also appeared to be 3 flashing lights in a V-shape, also headed due west at slow speed.  Same type of 3 sets of pulsating red lights in a V-shape as the previously observed ones.  Aropund 8:45pm, The westernmost object moved south at slow speed towards us, this would have put it over downtown Frankfort,KY or US-127. The eastern object I would guess would be in the Versailles Road/US-460 area maybe ?? We called the Franklin County, Kentucky dispatch center non-emergency number, they said quote &#34;What do you want us to do about it ?&#34; The dogs in the been barking continuously all night since about 6:30 if that means anything at all.  At 10:30PM this evening we went back out! side, we observed that both of the main objects were gone.   I am age 40, a human resources professional for the US government and a current graduate student.  My wife is age 33, a manager for an oil company and has 1 year of college.   I have been around aircraft my entire life having lived near 2 airports, plus spent 20+ years in the Civil Air Patrol.  Our event is not consistent with any aircraft I have ever seen before or any type of aircraft marker light beacons.  Objects were much brighter than stars in the night sky, weather conditions were clear with 3/4 moon, no clouds.  I&#39;ve never seen a star change position and drop objects...I have seen a meteor shower and &#34;shooting stars&#34; before, this was not either of those.<n>

I reported it quite some time ago when it was viewed outside my home.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This time it was off in the distance maybe 10 miles away. It was climbing at a shallow angle and moving to the northeast. This is similar to the path it took the first time I saw it.  The area it was over would be the Blue Mountain just north and west of Harrisburg.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The speed of the object was faster than regular aircraft and it was moving away from my location.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So this would place me behind and some what to the side of the object.<n>

There was some sparse cloud cover and I pulled over after I realized that the object did not display any typical required aircraft lighting.  The area is in the path of several major and minor airports in the Norther Bay Area so there is a lot of air traffic and the object was moving too slowly to be a falling.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I began to shoot digital photographs. A neighbor and two others were getting into a car in the adjacent driveway and they asked me what the object was.  I told the neighbor that I did not know and that is why I was trying to take photos, to which he replied &#34;Beam me up, Scotty&#34; indicating that he did not recognize what the object could be either.  It then changed direction and brightness and began to drift Southward over the University area, under the cloud cover, an estimated 200&#39; to 500&#39; above the ground and about a mile to my East.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I continued to take digital photos and tried to adjust settings on the camera to get a better image until it drifted too far away for the optics to capture an image.  At least five minutes from the initial sighting to the object drifting over the Southern horizon.<n>

It started getting dark about 30 minutes prior to my going outside tonight.  The skies are clear and the moon is about half full and brightly lit.  While looking up at about 6:02 pm, I noticed a spherical object moving North at a very rapid speed and the only light from object seemed to be from the moonlight only.  It appeared faintly lit by the moon&#39;s light only and had no flashing or strobe lights and faded into the northern sky.  It also appeared to move in a straight line heading north.  There also was no sound coming from the object.  Our Columbus (Ohio) International Airport is also about 2 miles North from the sighting location.  Maybe their radar picked it up?<n>

I pulled off the road into a mall parking lot and quickly got out of my car so that I can see it more clearly and tried to take a couple of snapshots with my blackberry phone which I sort of knew would not capture it.  I was a light grey and blended with the sky.

The first time was east at about 45 degrees, and this morning was, North West, at maybe 60 degrees.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The blink was probably as bright as Venus.

I said then what is that coming from the north, as he turned around, he saw another object that was exactly the same following the first one.

We pulled over to the side of the road and watched for 10 minutes as this continued, then seemed to stop.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The objects were just above tree level on the horizon. They moved at helicopter speed in a straight line parallel to the ground. They appeared suddenly, travelled for some distance, and then disappeared suddenly as they reached the same point in the sky. Their path was roughly parallel to the Northern Cross star formation, which was further to the west in the northern sky at that time of night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> For the most part, the objects moved in a straight line.  We first saw five in row.  One of them was slightly lower than the other 4, which were in a straight line.  The next group included three in a broad triangle pattern.  The rest came in smaller groups of 1 to 3 at a time with slightly longer intervals between appearances.  All seemed to move at the same speed across the sky along the same flight path.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The blinking lights of an airplane were visible in the same vicinity.  However, we could not judge relative distance and do not know if the plane was close to the objects or further in the distance.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We called the local police to see if anyone else reported this, but were told that no had as of 9:00 am on the next day.  This is a heavily travelled road in a densely populated area.<n>

I would say the distance from the ground to the object was the distance that you would normally see a small plane fly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object came to a complete stop for a few seconds, about four cars stoped at that point.  Also I would say the size of it was about the size of a car.  It totally disapeared because of the trees.  I then drove south on 301 to try to find an open area without trees after that I did not see it anymore.  The estimated time frame of the sighting was about five minutes.<n>

I was out in the stand around 5:00am Saturday morning.  The sky was crazy clear that day.  I made my way out to the deer stand.  Once I got there I opened a can of pop and sat back in my chair.  Started to stare into the sky.  I was looking for the few constellations that I knew (example:  Orion, big dipper, little dipper) just trying to pass the time. I happened to notice there was quite a few extra stars than normal around these constellations.  Then things got weird.  I started to notice a few of them moving.  Then some more started moving and then more.  There was a ton of them! Just one solid light could be seen.  Some moving in a straight line others were zipping in and out and around the others.  One came screaming across the sky and stopped at a dead halt.  These were definitely not comets or asteroids, too high for planes or helicopters.  Silent, they were too high to hear any sort of engines running.  I left the! deer stand around 7am.  As the sun started to come up it became harder and harder to see the lights in the sky. My buddies kid was hunting with us.  He had mentioned seeing something when we got back to the house.  At first I wasn’t going to say anything until he mentioned it.  I didn’t want anyone thinking I was crazy.  If I had to put a number on it?   I would say there was about 20+ objects in the sky that morning.  The next few days the sky was too cloudy to see anything in the sky.  I wish I would have had a decent camera to have videotaped this sitting.  My buddies girlfriend who live up there says people see things like that in the sky all of the time.<n>

The blinking light caught my eye and at first I thought it was an airplane, but then I noticed it was staying sort of stationary.  Then after looking at it, I realized, no, it wasn’t stationary, it was moving slightly left then right, then left then right, the up, then down, then left then right, etc.  It also changed shapes, and the colored lights changed from red to blue to green to yellow, etc.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In wonder, I yelled for my husband to come see.  He was downstairs, I was up.  Instead, he yelled, “What is it?” To which I told him I was looking at a UFO.  He looked out the window and just moments later yelled, “I see it!” and then verified where in the sky I was seeing it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It continued to “wiggle” in the sky and change colors.  It also changed shapes from round or spherical to oblong or blimp shape.  As it changed shapes, the colors changed.  It was almost like it was rotating.  We called our son who lives about 1/6 mile down the road.  He went outside and he saw it too.  He reported seeing the shape stay the same, but the colors changing and it appearing to move.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We could see the color changing and movement with the naked eye.  We looked at it through the binoculars, and it was DEFINITELY colored.  It was like looking into a spectrum.  All kinds of color!  Yet the next time you looked at through the binoculars it was all white.  Mostly it was colored.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It appeared to be high in the sky like a star, light up like a plane, and hovering like a helicopter.  It was too high to be a helicopter and it didn’t make any noise that we heard.  It stayed in the night sky and we decided to go to bed.  The next day, I posted on Facebook and friends told me it was a planet or comet or something.<n> <n><n> <n><n> November 6, 2011 –Again, we saw the same UFO in the night sky, again changing colors just as much, but moving back and forth and up and down just a little less.  Of course- when we saw it this night, we were at my Son’s house and remember he didn’t report seeing the same movement we did.<n> <n><n> <n><n> January 3, 2012 - My best friend – who lives about 15 miles away saw a UFO, possibly the same one.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Tonight, January 4, 2012 - Due to her sighting, I looked into the night sky, and the color changing orb is back.  Movement is not as strong, but the color changing is definitely there.  We talked on the phone and although trees and such near her house made it where she couldn’t see it earlier in the night, she did spot it later this evening.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Commentary - It might be a star or planet or something, and maybe pollution is causing the colors, but what is causing the movement?  It is usually about in the same spot (when it’s out there – it’s not always there) near Orion’s Belt.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
11/4/11 22:15|Lawrenceville|GA|Cross|10 minutes|Slow, low flying object with two red and two white flashing lights that made no sound and changed directions.|12/12/11|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/085/S85154.html|378|ndxe201111| Slow, low flying object with two red and two white flashing lights that made no sound and changed directions.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was driving home from work on Sugarloaf Parkway between Lawrenceville Hwy. and Five Forks Trickum at approximately 10:10pm.  I saw a craft flying lower than normal (not as low as the tree line, but not as high as a small plane would fly).  It seemed to be flying slower than would be possible for a plane, so it caught my attention.  Then I noticed it had two flashing white lights and then two flashing red lights in sort of a cross or square pattern.  I figured it was a small plane because of the flashing lights, but the fact that it was so low to the ground and was moving so slowly kept my attention.  I kept my eye on it as much as possible as I drove down the road and it seemed as if it changed directions (like it made a sharp right turn), so I thought it was either a helicopter or a trick of the eye as I was driving.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I lost sight of it, but then when I arrived at my home (less than five minutes later) I saw the object again directly over me (which was odd since it was now flying in the complete opposite direction of when I last saw it).  I was out of the car, standing still and it was moving very slowly overhead.  We are directly beneath the regular flight path of jets heading toward Atlanta airport, so I&#39;m very familiar with jet traffic in the area (which are much higher in the sky, but I can still hear them powering down as they prepare to land at Hartsfield, about 40 miles south).  At the same time the object was flying over me going north, a regular jet was flying overhead south toward Atlanta and I could clearly hear it.  In less than a minute the jet was completely gone and I could not hear it anymore, however, the lower object was still slowly flying over me, and that&#39;s when I realized that the lower object was not making any noise (so it was clearly not a plane or a helicopter). ! It made its way over the tree line and was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I stayed out waiting to see if it would come back for another hour, but it didn&#39;t.  However, a small plane did fly overhead (because I am near a small local airport) and I could clearly hear that it was a plane and it gave me a good reference for what altitude the small planes in the area fly.  The object I saw was definitely much lower than that plane.  I want to say that it was a box shape, but I&#39;m only basing that on the fact that the two white lights and two red lights were at four corners, but they almost appeared to be on one flat side rather than around an object.  The two white lights flashed together and the two red lights flashed together.  So, I can&#39;t really say what shape it was, maybe flat, maybe square, maybe diamond shaped.  It seemed more like it was meandering along quietly rather than hovering.  Almost like it was making a sweep of the area.  I tried to take a video of it with my phone, but I only got it for a second, so you can&#39;t really see anything.  I do! n&#39;t know what it was, but it was definitely unusual and I would be interested if anyone else has seen anything similar in the area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

One was very large compared to stars and airplanes... it was hard to tell what the shape was but I would say it was round.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The lights were all very close to the ground, from where we were they were very far and seemed a little too close to the land.  Mainly because there were airplanes flying a lot farther up from the lights.  And were barely visible.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The bigger light was flashing, and when I took a picture of it, it turned out very orange, couldn&#39;t tell if there was any color because of the brightness.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We drove somewhere close to the water, enough to see the bay bridge and the light.  By time we got there the two that that were below the bright light disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> And then there was just a bright light just hovering and making no movement.

Individual lights in the group would suddenly flash brightly and disappear.  Thought originally it might have been a satellite breaking up.  However, as we continued to watch, more lights would flick into existence and other groups would appear elsewhere in the sky, but all due West from our viewpoint.  Another group of four lights appeared ahead of the original group, equidistant from each other in a straight line covering about 100 yards.  These too blinked out but reappeared BEHIND the original group.  General color of lights yellowish but as those that blinked out were extremely bright white.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was a beautiful, clear day and I could see a small white object way up there in the sky.  We just watched it as it moved constantly, rotating in all directions, and progressing north, south, east, and west. It moved slow, fast, and even remained at a standstill for a few moments.  We watched it lower towards the Gulf until it was out of our site, as we cannot see the water past the houses.  It was not a parachute since there was no plane (we would have seen one, the skies were so clear, and it had no contrails.<n>

Was on my enclosed back porch, which faces east,  smoking a cigarette and saw an orange ball drop from the sky.  As I was looking in the direction that the ball fell, I noticed that a &#34;star,&#34; or what I thought was a star, start dancing around in the sky. It shot back and forth, rocked back and forth like a cradle, did circles in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The light was white, but every so often a red light would blink.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This started on Friday morning and I have seen it for the third morning straight now.

But the impression I got was that it was one craft with 3 lights.  I watched the skys for a bit longer then went inside to text about it. I then went back outside about 15 minutes later and at about 2:20 am saw about 7-8 dim white lights in a line, each light slightly staggered from the previous one.  This object moved as one object, it was likely a cigar shaped craft and it moved from North to South.

I kept looking out over the Gulf and noticing an orange-red spherical light in the sky.  I told my husband to stop in a spot where we had a clear view out over the Gulf.  We both witnessed 3 orange-red lights in a triangular formation.  They would appear for several seconds and then fade out.  At one point all three lights were showing at the same time; then one would fade out and then another fade out.  They appeared stationary while we were watching.  Eventually we saw the same type light farther out near the horizon until all the lights faded away.  There was no noise, no strobe blinking like an aircraft.  We’ve never seen anything like it.  We watched for about 5 minutes.<n>

At first I thought it was an airplane, but it never left its position.  It blinks rapidly between red, white and possibly green or blue.  I thought it could possibly be a satellite and shrugged it off.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After seeing this object in the same location for the last two weeks, my curiosity has gotten to me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Tonight, while outside I see another one exactly the same size and appears to be the same distance away off to the Northwest.  I asked my family to come outside and see if they are seeing the same thing or if I&#39;m just crazy.  They also thought it was an airplane until I asked them to go look after five minutes.  They both were still there. I have no idea what these could be.  Maybe they are just satellites, but these weren&#39;t there two weeks ago and the second one only appeared tonight.  Very curious<n>

It was moving too fast to be an airplane if one had been flying at that altitude.  It was also too slow to be a satellite.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The color of the light was bright white and did not change in intensity as the viewing angle changed.  There appeared to be a dark halo around the light with a small ring of light on the outer edge of this halo.  This might probably be an optical effect associated with the human eye though.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object faded from view approximately five minutes after the object was spotted.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There is an airport flight path near this witnesses home.  This witness is familiar with this path and the object was not on any known flight path.<n>

Then, 2 more came up from the horizon, heading straight up, got just above the tree line, and then disappeared.<n>

I could tell that it wasn&#39;t in the water because the river was flowing pretty good and I figured that if it was something burning that it would have moved with the water.  I checked for reflections of some sort but I could not find any thing. I kept my eyes on it because I didn&#39;t want it to disappear before my co-worker came out. I asked him what he could see while I was pointing to it.  He said it looked like fire he said he has never seen that before. I have never seen anything like it.  It burned out a few minutes after that. It reminded me of burner like on a gas stove.  The sky was cloudy and the water showed no sign of displacement.  And the sounds were normal.  Hope there is some sort of explanation for this occurrence.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain semi-anonymous; provides little contact information.  PD))<n>

I first thought it was two helicopters searching for something.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then the light on the left (facing me) begin to move slowly beside the other light until the two lights became one.  I thought to myself if it was a helicopter it would be impossible for the two to get so close.  After a couple of seconds they separated and flew in opposite directions with red &amp; white blinking lights like on an aircraft.  The direction in which I was facing I could see the power light (red) from the train station but these lights where further off in the sky.  I looked in the daylight to see if there was some tall tower with lights and I did not see anything.  It may have been the airforce or something but I thought it was strange.  I watch the news to see if any testing or training was going on in the airspace and nothing has been reported.  Of course my family thinks I am crazy, not sure what I saw but I saw something.<n>

It was 7:15pm, I went out and looked south and saw the large orange ball about 400 feet above his home.  My friend asked me to tape this but my camera was not charged.  I got out my binoculars and looked and saw an object that looked like an upside down lampshade, thinner at the bottom and wider at the top.  It was generating orange, red and yellow lights.  It left moving south to north.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I asked my neighbor to call back if he saw it again and he did at 8:10.  By this time I had my camera charged and I filmed the second object moving south to north for a couple of minutes.

The object appears reddish in color predominately, but changes to blue periodically and back to red.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was curious, but did not act on this information until late Nov 18, or early morning Nov 19, when I finally reported it to the dispatcher at the county sheriff&#39;s office.  She told me she would send a deputy out to investigate, but I have not heard anything on it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On or about Nov 21, I told a neighbor of the incidents and she and I watched the object together for a half hour or more.  The next evening, my neighbor and I saw two of the objects, and later that evening (early morning Nov 22) I observed an object approximately 90 degrees to the west of the first object I observed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Now on Nov 23, at approximately 8pm central time, I observed the object once again and notified my neighbor to come and participate.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What we discovered over a period of approximately 30 minutes of observation was at least eight objects of the same apparent design in different areas of the horizon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Some of the objects are faint and other are much brighter, but with them all a person can see what we deem a tail below the main object, and all the objects change color  occasionally to blue and back to red.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thus far, I have observed the objects in the North, at a medium altitude judging by eye, in the East, Southeast, West and North.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There are at any one time as many as 8 objects in the sky at any given time. They are not planes, towers or balloons.  No balloon would be more or less stationary for three weeks running.  Much too high for towers and of course planes are not stationary either.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At times the objects appear to make a loop or two in the sky and then become semi stationary again, only to do it again in a few minutes.  At other times the move a fair distance either vertically or horizontally and back to semi stationary.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is very curious and I would like to know what the objects are and who is responsible for them being in the night skies.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am not familiar with holograms, but as far as I know, this is not a rational explanation any more than a plane, tower or star.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Any other reports of a similar nature?  Curious in Texas.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))<n>

The sky was clear, around 60 degrees and a 10-15 mph wind.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I was leaving the location, I had placed some equipment in my truck and noticed a very large, bright white light to my South, towards Johnson City. It did not compare with Venus, Saturn, or any other planetary object.  It resembled aircraft landing lights, but 5-6 times larger, and about 30 degrees above the horizon, but appeared to be maybe only 1-2 miles from me.  It was the size of a dime at arms length.  It had the flickering illusion you see with aircraft on approach, but it wasn’t far enough away for that.<n> <n><n> <n><n> From this location, there are absolutely no airports, hospitals, etc to allow for low aircraft, and I have never seen a light like this.  I watched it for about 15 seconds, and it didn’t appear to be moving.  I foolishly turned my back on it to lock a gate to the location I was leaving, and in that 5-6 seconds, when I turned back around it was simply gone.  I had a wide open view of sky, and no where for it to have gone.  It had either just “turned off”, went quickly up or down, or zoomed off while I wasn’t looking.  The sky was empty of any aircraft what so ever.  Only stars and a ¼ moon setting about 60 degrees to the right (West).<n> <n><n> <n><n> While I do not consider this a major or impressive sighting, only a very strange light, what does bother me is how it left me feeling.  I am usually very much wanting to look for phenomenon such as this when out in the country away from the city lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have seen my share of very unexplainable things in my years, but this event left me feeling very uneasy and wanting to get out of the area immediately.  This is very unusual behavior for me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Anyway, I simply wanted to make report of it in case anyone else saw it and reported it too.<n>

He said hes seen strange things his whole life and how he just looks up and wonders.  im sitting next to him like yaaaa man kool question aha whats life about.  so hes pointing out planes and what not telling me how they all make him wonder.  a little after looking at something i thought was a plane he stands up yelling LOOK LOOK!  pointing up so i look up and maybe 100-200ft above us is a GIANT ((word deleted)) pitch black star wars lookin triangle.  i couldnt believe... i still have trouble fully believing because it was so dark and the ship blended in with the sky so i have no definitive picture in my mind..just the feeling. i asked my friend as soon as wqe started staring at it if he was messing with me! and he yelled no man look at that thing!

I looked outside, it was dark, 1015pm, and all of a sudden a large bright white light came over my house, moving at such a speed and so smooth.  It moved away from me but continued to be a very bright white ball of light,moving in a northwesterly direction.  I knew it wasn&#39;t a plane as when I watch planes come they seem to move so slow sometimes you think they arent even moving.  No noise was discernable, like a helicopter is unmistakeable.  Also it was moving away from me and the light did not change in shape or size.<n>

The front 5 to 6 lights formed a irregular circle followed by the rest in a zig zag line.  We heard no sound even though they seemed close enough to have heard some type of engine, although not close enough to make out any shape other than seeing the light they emitted.  The lights seemed to disappear in the clouds with one white light traveling back toward the northwest for a short period of time.  The entire episode lasted for less than 5 minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We have never seen anything like this before. It was somewhat unsettling.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.  PD))<n>

I was driving in my car.  I saw these things that looked like balls of fire. It was sprinkling a little bit so maybe it wasn&#39;t but it sure looked like it.  I only saw three at first they were in a triangle like shape.  They didn&#39;t stay that way though.  As they were floating(I say that because they were moving very slowly as if the wind were just carrying them)two of them started floating in and out of each other as if they were racing.  Then out the corner of my eye I see another one.  It was nowhere near the other three. I tried to take a pic. on my cell phone but I was driving in bad weather conditions at night and what i got looked like a fake or like a street light.  Either way it was no good.I called my husband and told him about what I had just seen. Ive looked on the internet to see if anybody else saw them that night or if anybody anywhere has seen the same thing. Ive looked at some pics. but have seen none that look like what I had seen.  I know what I saw and I believe what I saw was something out of this world and my husband also believes that I seen something strange that night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> bright flash in bellingham area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A flash of light lit my whole house.  My dog freaked out.  At the same time a friend who lives 15 miles away witnessed this same light and his dog freaked out aswell.   I was wondering if anyone else noticed this.  I have never seen a UFO and don&#39;t nessasarly beleive in them, but I can not think of another explaination.  My girlfriend has witnessed a similar occurance.

I ran outside about 1 minute later and saw about 8 round bright red and orange flickering objects hovering in the sky about 1/2 a football field away from me.  They made no sound.  They looked like glowing balls and the closest ones moved away pretty quick. Other people took out phones for pics or videos. I ran to my car and got my video camera and proceded to take 2 videos ( 1.5 minutes and 22 seconds, decent quality ).  They look less red in the video then what my naked eye saw, so I mentioned while taking the video that they were red. 2 more caught up and they followed the others leaving in the same exact direction. I believe they were the size of a car.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Here is a link to the video http://www.youtube.com/megahobbytube#p/u/6/FUBJ_kBYJ7s<n>

I was about to drive myself to the market.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Accordingly, I noticed a few very bright stars when suddenly, one of them started to move slowly towards the moon (crecent moon, I believe). The &#34;star&#34; slightly changed direcction (it didn&#39;t fly in a straight pattern) until it&#39;s own light vanished into the dark skies. I kept looking for it, but it totally disappeared from the sky view (which is completely strange for a star).<n> <n><n> <n><n> Now, I work for the military and I have seen plenty of planes, helicopters, and other types of aircraft and this was absolutely no known man made aircraft, at least not to my knowledge. I only report this incident in order to keep record of this fascinating event, and to share it with others.<n>

I watched what appeared to be a star flying through the sky ( i see these often but tonight there were several)  I watched it as it traveled down the horizon and disappearing over trees and the end of my driveway.  A few minutes later I see an orange Ball poke out from the tree line at about 15,000 feet up. (we have airplanes and helicopters over our house at least every hour this was much lower then flying range) I grabbed my son and brought him up the porch as I didn&#39;t know what this thing was going to do.  The orange ball slowly paraded over our driveway silently moving as it was about lined up with our house my wife came out I yelled for her to come quick  and we watched it increase in speed and moving at a 45 degree angle into the sky and appeared to either park or land on a star because when! i went out the next night it was still stationed where it stopped assuming it stopped and didn&#39;t land or drive by out of sight.<n>

I noticed a small, orange light appear in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After a second or two, another orange light appeared just above it and a bit to the right, forming a small diagonal.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Just as quickly as they had appeared, the first light went off followed by the second.  As they disappeared, they seemed to &#34;shudder&#34; off into the dark.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This was the third sighting I&#39;ve had in the Myrtle Beach area and the second in the last 2 years.  Every sighting has been the same in color and shape, from what I can tell.  My very first sighting was in September of 2003 and was too close for comfort.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After seeing orb-like orange lights along the coast and then in the Carolina Forest area, I experienced what appeared to be two extremely bright white lights (I&#39;ve described them as looking like the headlights on a car) hovering silently just above a two-story house, over the driveway.  There were six witnesses that night, but only three of us believed what we saw was a UFO.<n>

PD))|12/12/11|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/085/S85086.html|440|ndxe201111| Strange Lights Seen in Ohio Hang Above for Two Nights<n> <n><n> <n><n> The first strange light was viewed in the 308 degree North West from 40 degree 55&#39;58&#34; N, 81 degrees 27&#39;55&#34; W.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It appeared to move not only up and down but also in a circular pattern twice over the 30 minute period. It mainly &#34;quivered&#34; from its original spot in between two nearby stars, which, to the other witness and I, provided a point of reference to verify that it was in fact moving. It appeared to have a halo of incredible darkness around it that sometimes restricted how much light we could see from our viewpoint.  It also appeared to be spinning on an axis at a perfect 90 degree angle, which revealed &#34;pillars&#34; of light (for lack of a better descriptor) that emanated outward every 45 degrees around the edges of the base sphere of light that seemed to be constant.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The second strange light was seen in nearly the exact opposite direction of the previous light, but it was lower in the sky and seemed closer to us.  This light appeared very much like the first one but was much more active.  It moved in a pattern that resembled the symbol for infinity for a few seconds, then would slowly creep back towards its original position, then move again, slightly yet definitively and quickly.  This second light even made a zig-zag pattern to the left and right of its original position relative to the nearby stars.  It too even showed a pinhole-effect (restriction of light) which seemed to be caused by a &#34;ring&#34; of darkness around it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Both of the lights also had a constant &#34;flickering&#34; effect to them that seemed like it was inconsistent, and may have been a result of the light&#39;s spinning, as when the pinhole effect would take place the light became much smaller and perfectly spherical.  These were the two brightest things in the sky besides Jupiter at this point of the night, and your eye was drawn to it.  They moved fluidly and unlike anything I&#39;ve ever seen, almost as if someone had an incredibly powerful laser pointer and was trying to hold it steady, but the light came down on us and not from the ground up.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Like I said we were all very far away from it, and when we saw planes fly near them from our point of view they seemed to be possibly as far as in orbit around our planet, and possibly as close as 50,000 feet up.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Both of the lights were viewed extensively and this was the second night in a row I have seen them both in very similar positions in the sky if not the same position.  I downloaded an app on my phone that shows all of the stars in the known universe by pointing at them in the sky and both of these objects did not register with the app as anything known to us in the sky.  This includes planets, constellations, galaxies, and even satellites (there are even Russian craft).<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have also been recruiting more witnesses since yesterday and tonight three more of my friends verified that they too were seeing the same event of these incredibly strange lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Possible sighting of stars??

11/1/11 00:00|Belchertown|MA|Other|~3 minutes|Unexplained lights in the woods by Quabbin Reservoir|11/19/12|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/094/S94347.html|444|ndxe201111| Unexplained lights in the woods by Quabbin Reservoir<n> <n><n> <n><n> Ill first state that what I saw was not a craft, but lights beaming through the woods Route 9 by Quabbin Reservoir.  It was a little after 12 midnight and I was driving home from a friend’s house.   My friend was fast asleep in the passenger seat and I was about 10 minutes away from being in the downtown area of Belchertown where I lived.  We were driving along, I had the radio on listening to some music and I was still very much awake, even after a long day.<n> <n><n> <n><n> All of a sudden, on the passenger side of my car, the woods light up like a football stadium.  The light was a bright harsh light beaming through the trees in all direction, but not above the tree tops.  The next thing I know my car went dead.   All the lights in the dashboard, headlights, radio, GPS, engine everything.  It almost seemed like my car had a catastrophic failure.  My friend abruptly woke up and asked “What ((deleted)) just happened?”  I said I don’t know man there’s something going on in the woods.  I thought it was the military or something at first but it all seemed like something out of a Sci-Fi movie.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was travelling the speed limit, which I do believe is 50 MPH on that stretch of road.  I quickly thought to slam on my breaks, as I couldn’t see a thing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I coasted for maybe another 45 seconds to a minute down the road. As I was coasting, my car all of a sudden came back to life. Still coasting, still in gear (I never touched the ignition or put it in neutral) my engine came back to life, headlights and everything. When I looked at my dashboard clock, it had reset itself, as did my GPS.  I reached my house a few minutes later and my friend got in his car and drove home. A few days later I contacted my friend and asked him what he had seen and he bluntly stated “I don’t know what you’re talking about.” Which brings me to why I’m posting a year later… I brought the incident up a week ago, and he told me exactly what I had seen. He was skeptical to admit the situation a y! ear ago, and finally decided “it wasn’t all in our heads.” I’v! e always believed in the extraterrestrial, and now he does too…<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date is approximate.

11/1/11|New York City (Bronx)|NY|Changing||Upon my rooftop.  Every night.  ((NUFORC Note:  Date is imprecise.  PD))|12/12/11|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/085/S85068.html|445|ndxe201111| Upon my rooftop.  Every night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In the Bronx, New York, I have witnessed hundreds of white or beige ufos chasing blue lights.  The blue are of a beautiful blue color hovering slowly about 16 ft. above our heads.   My nephews and I spend a lot of time on the roof of my apartment building (that I am a former superintendent of) about 6 stories high.  We are located just one block away from the Yankee Stadium.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I can guarantee anyone who will come and visit me will indeed witness what we have been witnessing for the past ten years.  They appear so very often about 10 or 15 minutes apart from each other. We&#39;re up to a point that we point them out and continue on a different conversation as though we haven&#39;t just seen a ufo. Many of my guests have left my premises with their mouths dropped in a state of shock.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They hover very closely and extremely obvious.  The white oval ones seem to have a light inside of them and the blue ones seem the same, just a lot smaller.  When the white ones chase the blue ones they catch up and carry them out back towards the direction they came from.  For some funny reason we barely notice an attachment between the two of them.  Seems like a string or a stick like object. Very thin.  These objects never look completely oval, they seem to change shape like some type of liquid metal.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Like I said before, anyone can come visit me and we are guaranteed to see a whole bunch, sometimes even fleets of about 20 to 100.<n>
