We could hear sounds from far away, jets overhead at cruising altitude preceding their noise, dogs barking 1 mile away, ticking noises from the cooling car engine after it was turned off, etc. We saw an object with three lights, one at each corner or close to each corner pass silently overhead. The lights were not marker lights, not strobes, they remained constant. the lights were not beam lights, but rather seemed the size of one&#39;s fingernail on an outstretched arm. The color was a yellowish sort, rather like the color of street lights. There were no other strobe or marker lights required by th FAA on all aircraft flying in commercial airspace, and there was no noise. It passed in a straight path and constant speed overhead from north to south. We thought perhaps it was a stealth bomber returning to Whiteman Airforce base but the lack of lights and noise caused us to question it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

The program was describing a sighting that took place in the 1600’s or 1700’s by the crew of a sailing vessel.  The object in the animation, that was built from the written accounts of the sighting was exactly what I saw one afternoon in San Juan Puerto Rico.  I was doing a preflight inspection of my aircraft and while walking around the nose of the aircraft I saw an object ascend from a swampy area just off the concrete area of the apron, approx. 150 yards.  The object was a very shiny blue with the color slightly darker toward the top and a little lighter toward the bottom.  What caught my attention at first was it was a perfect sphere.  It rose slowly at first going straight up to a height of about 200 to 300 feet.  It stopped just for a second then slowly started moving in the direction of the city, toward the west.  As it moved it appeared to gain altitude slightly and veer a little then it gained speed until it was over the town.  At that point it went straight up at a very fast pace.  I lost sight of the object at that point.  Except for the slight veering it did while moving from my location to town all changes in direction were at right angles. Also it made now sound that I could hear. Why I thought this was not some natural object was because of it’s color, exact shape and right angle movements.  The object itself was exactly like what was described on the UFO Files last night.   What also is fascinating to me is that the object from my sighting and the sighting I reference is 300 years or more apart.<n>

They seemed to be incredibly high up, but even at night when things are pretty quiet I heard nothing as I would expect from a plane or planes flying over. The lights-which had no tails-simply flew from north to south. It was practically over as I realized I was seeing something visibly odd.When asked of the size of the group, I said it was about double the size of a full moon-the whole group.Their speed was unimaginably fast and their light was constant-no brightening or diminishing.They appeared separate but moved as one.<n>

It was the size of about 1/6 to 1/5 the diameter of the moon.  It had an orange tail that was about 10 degrees long.  It was travelling from East to West and burned out about 4 seconds after I first saw it.<n>

Smell of ozone shortly after.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was standing outside at approx. 7:25 pm when I saw a bright green fireball silently fall behind some trees to the NNE.  It appeared to go down somewhere between my location and the town of Curlew, WA.  I am just south and slightly east of Bodi Mt.. (17 miles south of Canadian Border) A few minutes passed and a light breeze came up from the N. and I smelled a *very* strong smell like just before a rain storm. I think this is the smell of ozone.  This may or may not be associated with the phenomena. There was only a faint wisp of cloud cover and the 1/2 moon was nearly at appex. The fireball reminded me of a flare but there was no sound or scent of explosives. By about 8pm there was considerable airtraffic in the area.  Again this may not be associated with the fireball either but just something I noted. This is the thrid fireball I&#39;ve seen since mid summer. One of the others was also green and in the northern sky and the other was reddish abd in the southern sky.  I don&#39;t remember dates.  I wrote them off as unusual meteors until I heard of the reports on the Art Bell.<n>

From the corner of my eye to the left of the steering wheel I spotted a flash of light. As I focussed I saw a orange fireball descending into the atmosphere or speeding east in the early evening sky. The object was quite large, slightly smaller then the full moon from the city vantage. The centre of the object was orange and it was glowing white/orange. The fireball disappeared at the height of the buildings or treeline. At this time it was early dusk and quite light in the sky. I could only see one bright star visable and was light enough I did not have my headlamps turned on. There was plenty of traffic. This is downtown Vancouver. I had one passenger with me. I asked him if he saw it! He described the same thing I witnessed. He has made a taped statement for me.<n>

It was still dark.  I saw a large, straight line of about 10 lights moving quickly and soundlessly across the northern sky.  The formation formed a perfect horizontal line, and as it continued to move, the line of lights changed formation into a horseshoe shape and I lost sight of it as it passed behind my building. I heard absolutely no sound as this happened and the lights were yellow-white like a light bulb. I was not able to see if the lights were part of one object or independent of each other<n>

We noticed a bright white light moving South fairly fast and high in the atmosphere, towards another white light that was above the other. I called my husband and since we both work for an aerospace company in the area we could tell it was not any type of an aircraft, to be that high, bright and stop so suddenly. The three of us (mother, husband and myself) stood and watched it for about 5 minutes and my mother had to leave, then about 5 minutes later the lower light omitted a blue flash and disappeared in an instant, the other one stayed, and about 10 minutes later it disappeared, but this time i didn&#39;t notice the blue flash and reappeared in a different part of the sky, i watched it for another 15 minutes or so and it seemed to disappear into a cloud staying with the cloud as if to move with it, hiding. About 10-15 more minutes it appeared again in a different part of the sky lower this time, and i could see it very well, no clouds, finally it disappeared as if to fade away.<n>

I am saying the object emitted other objects because it emmitted the tail.I don&#39;t know what a meteor&#39;s size would be normally so maybe this is typical- I  myself have just never seen anything like it.<n>

I saw a bright, white, spherical object moving across the clouds (it was bright enough to contrast the cloud) heading from north to south, bisecting the Interstate. It was moving fairly rapidly from my perspective, then it either vanished, or disappeared in to the cloud.  Seconds after it disappered, a darker object appeared at the same level, in the same cloud, but heading in the opposite direction at a slower rate of speed.  After watching the dark object for a while, it appeared to be an airplane, but I had not seen an airplane approaching before the white sphere disappeared.<n>

It seemed very low and had no FAA required strobes,and was silent. I&#39;ve never given much thought to seeing a UFO but here was one, Ive lived near airports all my life and can tell most aircraft just from their light pattern. It took about 3 seconds to realize this was nothing Ive seen before. It passed directly overhead slowly then faded into the light pollution to the west. I was freaked out about it, and as I stood there a brilliant light shot back in the opposite direction that the triangle had come from at a teriffic speed. Five seconds later a commercial airliner from Love Field came into view, headed east. It must have been seen by the 737, but I dont know if they reported it. I haven&#39;t till now. I keep up with aircraft developments and this didn&#39;t fit the bill. It doesn&#39;t even make bad sense to make a secret test flight the wrong way down one of the most crowded outbound flight paths in the US. Needless to say, I look up a lot since then.<n>

Collins Colorado at a mountain home at about 8500 ft elevation.  At 11 pm they saw directly above two identical objects approaching each other, appear to meet, then cross each other&#39;s path, and diverge.  The general flight direction of the entire event was from east to west, and the event lasted approximately 10 minutes.  After the two objects crossed, one&#39;s flight path was directly overhead, and its speed was very slow.  It was observed to fly west and appeared to hover far in the west for a long time.  ((witness names deleted)) showed two other people the hovering light in the west.  By this time it appeared no more unusual than a first magnitude star. At the crossing point of both objects their largest angular extent was the size of a ping-pong ball at arm&#39;s length.  There was no sound heard throughout the sighting except near the crossing point when a very faint jet aicraft-like sound was heard for less than one second. Since it was dark during the sighting, no shapes were observed for either object.  However the distinguishing features of both these objects were three whitish lights arranged in an equilateral triangle, with a brighter red-orange light in the center of the triangle.  The red light seemed to pulsate.  Strange as it may sound, the red light appeared to grow especially intense during moments of skepticism as the observers speculated about these objects actually being terrestrial aircraft. This pulsation apparently linked to thoughts was most intense as the one object was hovering in the western sky.<n>

Objects were first seen from the southeast about 75 or 80 degrees off the horizon.  The objects were redish orange in color and appeared as square shaped light through a 6X spotter scope on a 4.5 inch relecting telescope.  The objects were not abreast each other in a perfectly straight line. At one time, one object fell behind and then quickly caught up to the formation.  The two sets were close to being in line with each other at a distance of 8 to 10 lengths of a single formation. The objects continued to move at a constant speed toward the northwest.  The two formations then separated at about 70 degrees off the northern horizon; one direction unknown, the other moved west and the formation appeared to close in on its self, but still abreast one another.  The objects could be seen with the naked eye, and appeared as fuzzy or hazy lights, not sharp like that of a star. The objects then appeared to fade or diminish in intensity as they moved westward. The object were obscured from view by trees and could no longer be followed. The objects were first noticed while I, an amateur astronomer, was observing Jupiter.<n>

It was a Saturday night, after 9 p.m., and we were sitting on the back porch. I thought I had seen a shooting star, so we were both watching the sky for more. All of a sudden a bright ball of white light lit up the sky in front of us. It was approximately 100 feet over tree-top level. Comparitively, the UFO was about the size of a baseball in the sky. It then travelled quickly from a west to east direction at high speed, leaving a tail of light behind it like a comet. It made no audible sound. It was a wooded area we were in, so it was out of sight quickly -- we only witnessed it for a matter of seconds. We both stayed out for an hour afterwards hoping to see it again, but it never came back.<n>

I looked up and saw a pewter grey disk directly overhead.  The disk was hovering at a really high altitude.  Underneath the disk was an orange ring of &#34;energy&#34;.  We observed this craft for over 10 minutes and it never went away.  My friend thought it was a weather balloon but admitted that he was unsure what it was.  There were two other couples at the summit but we are not sure if they saw it too.  There was no sound and it left no trails.<n>

I could see it going from west to east, as if it was following the interstate highway, (interstate 80).  It was moving faster than what a plane would travel, but slower than a falling star.  I have seen plenty of falling stars, and this did not have the same characteristics, mainly the fact that it was brighter, and larger, and did not lose substance as it travelled.  It went east over the horizon as far as I could see.  A fellow officer who was working also remarked on the radio that he had seen it also.<n>

I then went to my backyard becuase there are less trees,and looked up and saw nothing.I then went back to the front of my house,(same route),and once i arrived at my driveway,near my deck,almost ready to enter my door,i saw a very bright white light. (I did not see it when i was leaving my house,becuase it was in back of me.)I then went inside to get my binoculars and zoomed in the light was steady and did not blink,the shape did not change.  I then looked above my roof to see if there were any other objects near it,and i saw what at first i thought was a comet.(Some haze)I zoomed in and i saw 5 white circles,with steady non blinking light,the objects did not move,all the circles were the same size.(The circles were much smaller and farther away than the other object to the right.) The circles were arranged one behind another equally spaced in a arrangement that looks like a hook. I was pretty convinced this was a comet,as soon as I looked at it becuase one circle in the middle had a little haze around it.But that would not explain how the much bigger circle and much closer circle did not have haze around it also.  It was very cold out and i went inside for about 15-20 min then went back out to see if the objects moved,and they did not.I then zoomed in on both objects again and there shape did not change and they did not move.I went back inside after 5 min,then i went back outside after my dog started barking (he does this alot i doubt it had anything to do with the light).But I did find it strange and i was a bit scared becuase he stayed outside for about a hour,and i thought the weather got to him,or he got to a fight with another animal. I yelled out his name a couple times 4 or 5 and he came in. I then went back outside with my binoculars for a final look and the objects did not change. I went back inside.  I assume the objects may have stayed out there all night until the early morning,but i was to cold and not very impressed by it,(i thought it was a comet),but know think otherwise.(After hearing all the reports. The report of this object sounds very similar to mine! : http://www.ufocenter.com/S3913.html   Except that it did not move fast. And i saw the object a hour after his,[makes sense if it was coming to me it would take a while]and the object he viewed was moving east(coming towards new england),maybe this is the same object.Also there seems to be a few white only objects. ALSO:This object sounds the same an occured in my state!! AMBER OVOID UFO SEEN IN PORTSMOUTH, RHODE ISLAND http://www.sightings.com/ufo/spainreleases.htm On Tuesday, September 22, 1998, at 4:18 p.m., Roscoe Sweeney (a pseudonym), a 22-year-old sailor in the U.S. Navy, &#34;was driving north on Burma Road&#34; in Portsmouth, Rhode Island (population 13,840) &#34;one mile from the Melville shipyard&#34; when he spied a UFO. &#34;It started above the tree line, about 10 degrees above the horizon, and disappeared into the clouds... Ended up slightly 30 degrees up. The departure angle was close to 45 degrees. It departed into the west and up.&#34; &#34;I&#39;m a reliable judge of speed. This thing was smoking and accelerating! Speed 400 to 500 knots, with a behind-the-trees dash at Mach 1 (600 knots), easy.&#34; &#34;It was the brilliance that brought my eye to it. If I had done a slow blink, I would have missed it completely. This was truly an amazing sight.&#34; He described the UFO as &#34;oval, like if you put your thumb and index finger together to make the OK sign. No blinking lights. Glowed like looking at a picture of the filtered sun...amber/gold.&#34; Portsmouth is on Aquidneck Island in Rhode Island&#39;s Narragansett Bay, about 25 miles (40 kilometers) southeast of Providence, the state capital. (Email Interview) I could check my local airport -(tf green),[across the cornfield]next to my house, to see if they spotted anything on radar [<n>

I have only told family members about this and I wish I had known about the reporting center at the time.  I didn&#39;t write it down and wish I had.

Now if this had been a satalite it must have been VERY close to the moon because the shadow was moving along the land at a very quick pace. I could not have been somthing to far above .5 miles of the moons ground the shadow was not to large. I followed it Down (in reality it was up the telescopr give a reverse upsidown view) to the Mare Crisium. where it STOPED momentarily for about 30 seconds neer the crater Gauss and then WOOOSH it was gone in a split second. It must have gone to light speed or something, because it was gone in on time.<n>

I thought he was watching the TV, when he said &#34;Did you see that?&#34;  I said &#34;What,,, on TV?&#34; He said &#34;No, outside&#34;  So we both got up and went out on the front porch and looked up.  We didn&#39;t see anything, so he started telling me what he saw.  I had heard a bit on Art Bell radio show but, just let him tell me. I asked size, colour and direction.  He said the ball and the tail were green.  It was clear sky, no clouds, fog down low across the valley and fields.  We were inside with the TV on, so didn&#39;t hear anything.<n>

9/24/98 23:59|Wyola|MT|Disk|half an hour|I looked forward and noticed in the upper right hand corner of the wind shield a dark well defined disk shaped object.|11/1/98|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/004/S04487.html|50|ndxe199809| The day was Thursday September 24th.  My wife and I were traveling west bound on I-90 where the Wyoming and Montana border meet at approximately midnight.  We decided to set a goal of getting into Montana before stopping for the night, finding a motel room in a small town.  There were loads of deer crossing signs and we nearly hit one crossing the road.  Because of the lack of cars on the road we were able to switch to high beams so I was tunnel visioned, while driving,  to watch for deer on the road.  It was then that we noticed the solar flare stuff that was lighting up the sky that has been in the news lately.  We pulled over to the side of the road to look at the brilliant illuminating effect.  We totally shut the lights off and stood looking up at it amazed.  We got back in the car and I wanted to continue looking at the shimmer of white light.  The only place I could do that was behind me over my left shoulder.  It was then that I noticed a quarter sized perfect circle cutting out one of the shimmering flare areas in the sky.  I looked at it several times.  Then I looked forward and noticed in the upper right hand corner of the wind shield a dark well defined disk shaped object.  I said to my wife &#34;You will think I am crazy if I tell you what I see&#34; and she joked that it must be a UFO.  I said I  think so and asked her if she saw the object.  She said she did and she continued to watch it.  She said it was moving and I meantime was looking at two and sometimes three directly ahead of us.  The third of those objects kept collapsing in on itself.  There were no lights on any of them.  They were not clouds, as the sky was perfectly clear.  The quarter sized circle thing had vanished but directly out my driver side window was a long very large cigar shaped object - dark but very clearly defined.  Sometimes it was rectangular and sometimes triangular.  Very clearly defined but dark.  Then that object became more abstract in shape. In the upper left hand corner of the windshield appeared a large object saucer shaped with a raised area in the middle.  It appeared to have at least one porthole type feature.  It stayed in that position for what seemd like 10-15 minutes as we drove along.  We were both scared crazy but kept driving at 65 mph.  The object stayed in what seemd a fixed position in the upper left hand corner of the windshield and the shimmering light quality of the flare effect revealed sort of a greyish color to the object.  All at once a long line of blackish linked wing like things, seemingly all linked together, moved closer and closer and seemed like they were almost at the end of the car hood and then vanished.  Then everything was gone. The next day I woke up and my eyes were burning and very, very bloodshot.<n>

They disappeared as fast as they appeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I don&#39;t even believe in UFO&#39;s or even the phenomenon that I witnessed last night, but replaying the video has prompted me to tell someone. September 24, 1998 North Pole Alaska approx 2235 AKDT until 2243 AKDT Northern sky low just west of the North Star. I had been outside filming the Northern Lights which were spectacular last night.  I happened to look out kitchen window and saw two orange fiery balls hovering just above the horizon.  I grabbed by video camera and filmed them.  Only a short time did both appear together as the one on left was lower and believe the tree line blocked clear view.  They did not move forward or back or up or down only when they finally disappeared as they seemed to slowly lower and sink into the horizon. The object can be seen clearly and rotating, I think counter clockwise. You can clearly see gases or image like fire encircling the objects. They appear like giant asteroids but how could they appear so close and yet not enter the atmosphere.  I have NEVER seen nor witnessed anything like it.  You can hear the dogs howl and whine in fear of whatever it was.  I tried to call local news etc., but guess they think I&#39;m nuts.  I called the Air Force Security at Eilison AFB nearby and they put me on hold and simply said.  &#34;Contact public affairs in the morning and they will come and pick up the video.&#34; Dave Myers System Programmer University of Alaska 907-474-6266<n> <n><n> <n><n> Witness was interviewed on Art Bell 9/25<n>

The light appeared too large, moved at a rate to quickly, and angle to steep for it to be an airplane.  It also moved to slowly for it to seem like a shooting star.  It did not leave a trail. The path of the object was linear and did not vary, and descended from east to west at an angle of approx. 30 degrees. The light from the object seemed very white. I only witnessed it for a period of less than 5 seconds before my view was obstructed.<n>

I wanted to open the sliding door and stand out there and look at it, but I was too afraid.I just stood there staring at it. It was grey and it didn&#39;t look like it had lights on it. I was the only one in the kitchen so I was the only one who saw it. My vision shook all of a sudden and everything was a blur. I opened the door(I was no longer in shock.) there was a flash of light and it was gone. no body believed me.<n>

Last night at about 1:30 am, we decided to take a study break and walk around outside.  After about 1 minute, we saw an object near the horizon.  It was a small circular white light that was traveling at a slow speed.  Since there is an airport nearby, we thought we were seeing the landing lights of an airplane.  However, the object slowed to a stop and then emitted a white flash and disappeared.  The flash was not very bright, but yet it seemed to cover the entire sky.  We estimated the object&#39;s distance to be about 2 or 3 miles.  We heard no sound.<n>

I was facing at 310 degrees (compass heading) and looking up at what I think was the Big Dipper.  To the left of the &#34;handle&#34; of the Big Dipper, at about a 45 degree angle from the horizon, a ball of white light with a greenish glow arround the circumfrence;  looked as if it dropped straight down.  The light  lasted about 2 full seconds.  I&#39;m not sure if there was a &#34;tail&#34; or just the image of the bright light on my  retina.  I would approximate the size of the ball of light as about 5 to 10  times the size of the dot of light of Jupiter which was in the sky behind me.<n>

Outside, while facing northwest of downtown Bellevue, WA a friend and I observed a white/green fireball drop from a high altitude then disappearing (not slowly burning out, but instantly &#34;turning off&#34;) roughly 200 feet before hitting the ground and before it disappeared behind any structure or treeline.  It &#34;fell&#34; at a rate faster than terminal velocity or any aircraft but nowhere close to that of any &#34;falling star&#34; that I or my friend had ever observed.  We observed it from a high altitude and it became brighter and larger the closer it got to the ground.  At the instance of its disappearance it was brighter than any firework, flare, or aircraft landing light and 1/4 the size of a full moon.  Distance was the most difficult to judge.  We &#34;estimate&#34; its distance 2 miles.  Seemingly falling into/towards Lake Washington.<n>

It appeared, from north-east to south-west and disappeared abruptly. I was listening to Art Bell at the time and had just heard about green fier balls and such appearing all around the country. At the exact moment that I heard the guest say that  it was important to try and get an exact time of sighting I saw the object in the sky through my windshield. I noted the time on my vehicles digital clock and have since compared it to other clocks. My vehicle clock is one minute slow, so the exact time of my sighting is 10:49 pm on Wednesday, 1998. The object appeared stright ahead of me at about 80 degrees and disappeared to the left at about 50 degrees above the horizion.<n>

The fire ball was about as big as your finger nail with arm extended. This white ball had a tail following it. In the middle of the white ball was blue. Like the color of natural gas burning on your stove. I looked like a shooting star, but was too close to the earth and too big. I live in the northwest part of Houston. I was sitting in my garage, looking south- southwest when I saw it. I didn&#39;t see where it came from, it appeared and fell to the earth very fast. It dissapeared behind the house across the street. I&#39;ve never seen something like that before. I thought it was a plane crash. Nothing on the news untill I heard your director on Art Bell&#39;s radio show last night.<n>

It was much bigger and much much brighter than any star, but smaller than the moon (maybe 1/6th to 1/8th the size of the moon.  It looked like a bottle rocket except it was green and the angle wrong.  It was traveling from East to West, coming down at about a 45 deg. angle.  It lasted about 3 to 4 seconds.  It looked like it landed in north Kent.  It had all the characteristics and trajectory of a meteorite except it was a little slow for a meteorite, but I think that may be explained if it were moving toward or away from me.  It did seem to be low in the sky (I could see it at the top of my windshield and it ended up about half way down on the right side. I have seen one or two like it before in my life except they were not green.  It did not do anything funny like stopping or changing direction.  I think the green comes from copper material in the meteorite burning up.  My final conclusion:  It was a meteorite.  Probably the most spectacular one I&#39;ve ever seen, certainly the most colorful.  When I got home about 2145 I called my flight instructor and told him about it.  Then I turned on my radio about 2218 and tuned into the Art Bell show and heard you guys talking about what I saw.<n>

It was trailing faint red sparks.  I believed it burned out before reaching the horizion as i continued to follow the trajectory after it wnet out to see what would happen nothing did but I had no horizontal reference point so it may have passed over the horizon.  The direction noted at the time was Northeast to Southwest.  The altitude upon sighting was extremely high and then it lost altitude as it moved to the Southwest from the Northeast.  The range from inception was just South and an undetermined distance east and it moved considerably down range during the sighting.  As for the altitude and range estimations no Earth visual clues were availible.  Immediately upon seeing this object I noted my watch as 9:11 Pacific Daylight Savings time. The object itself:  Since there was not a frame of reference the exact or reasonably estimated size object is unknown.  The object was large and the green light probaly could have illuminated clouds if they had been around.  The color was bright emerald green.  The center of the ball was almost bright white/green and it was about 20% of the diamter of the object.  The object also trailed a sparky red tail that was about 2 times longer than the grren ball&#39;s diameter.  Interesting to note is that I was driving at about 60 mph and the object was spotted out the top of the windsheild.  I wonder how far it may have traveled before I started observing it.  Also interesting there was no noise from this object.  Bacground on the author.  B.S. Civil Engineering from University of Washington.

We have spent many hours out there in the evenings observing the high altitude jets on their way to Seattle; and counting satellites as they orbit and the occasional metorite.  I mention this only to indicate that we are very familar with the normal nighttime sky activity. At approximately 9:10PM, I interrupted our conversation, pointed at the sky and said WHOA!.....WHOA!......WHOA!......WHOA! as I tracked the light across the sky.  It is my exclamations that now help me estimate the time duration of the event.  In this time it traveled from the east to the west in about a 60 degree arc until it passed behind a tree.  I also estimate the angle from the horizon was about 60 degrees to the south of our location in Cascade Park, Vancouver, WA. Some things I noticed most unusual:  The speed slowed and became brighter toward the end of my vision, glowing a bright greenish blue.  The size of the fireball seemed larger at the end, about the size of  a baseball in the air at 30 feet.  Also, even from the beginning of the arc the speed of this object was much slower than and metorite I have ever  observed and we did enjoy the recent summer meteor showers.<n>

I was travelling home on the freeway named above, and looked up just in time to see this green fireball.  I thought it was strange, since it was big enough to be very close, yet it did not die out, like fireworks would do.  It just kept moving towards the west, and then disappeared over the hill on my right (out of view).  There was one other person with me in the car, but that person was talking and did not see it.  It did not give it any more thought, until I turned on the Art Bell show, and heard a lady in Seattle call in and describe the very thing that I had just seen. I know the time was right about 9:10pm, because I had just left a store in the University District, and the travel time to the point of observation was about ten minutes.<n>

She said &#34;I wonder if it was a UFO.&#34; At 10:15PM I was listening to Art Bell and realized I was not the only person who saw an object in the night sky. I then decided to report this event.<n>

At 21:10, I was standing outside on the roof garden enjoying the night air. When I looked to the south, I saw a bright green fireball coming out of nowhere and descent fairly slow and dissappear in midair. There was no sonic boom or explosion or any smoke afterwards.The object had a reddish coloured tail. It was circular and appeared to be aproximately the size of a car but round. I was the only person standing on the roof garden when this occured.I am a Licensed Practical Nurse by trade and was off duty this particular night.<n>

Object appeared to have a direct trajectory of 20 degrees downward as it traveled.  Initially appeared to be a meteorite, but blossomed into fireball within a half second of being spotted.  Fireball developed, appeared to be white/greenish white.  Looked reminiscent of re-entry of manned space capsules seen in pictures.  Appeared to be eminating from center of object and fanning out to the rear.  Object moved relatively slow compared to the quick meteorites seen in shower months.  Object appeared to burn out, dimming in intensity and just before extinguishment appeared to have several apparent red embers floating behind it. From south of Bothell, elevated at approximately 75 ASL, it appeared as one looks directly south, the bearing was from 160 degrees on the compass going to approximately 250 degrees. There was an aircraft on final for SeaTac who would have had an excellent view of the object, appearing to be about even with the 520 bridge on their approach.  The light as it extinguished appeared to be at an altitude well above the airliner on approach.  No other aircraft were noted to be in the area at the time. The object, for reference, seemed at it&#39;s biggest, to be about 33% the size of a full moon as it is typically seen overhead. The observer is a former military electronics technician, with some aviation experience, and on track to earn his private pilot wings in second quarter &#39;99.  The observer was standing outside with a clear view, on a clear night, with no obstructions impeding the event.<n>

The fireball was on a slightly downward course for the duration of time in which the object was visible (5 seconds). It disappeared in what seemed to be mid-air. There were no viewing obstructions as the particular area was flat farm land. There was a long white tail following the object. From past experiences witnessing meteorites we are quite positive in saying that the object seen tonight was not such space debris. I am a government employee with the B.C Ministry of Forests (Victoria branch) and I am currently the president of our local soccer association. My son is 19 years old and currently employed with a local restaurant. I am 48. I hope this is helpful.<n>

What I saw was what appeared to me as a shooting star, the object resembled a shot from a roman candle that was what I judge as about 10 times that in diameter.  It appeared at the area that I described and traveled at a high rate of speed in a strait line towards the horizon and appeared to be traveling in a descending northwesterly direction.  This lasted about 1.5 seconds and the object disappeared at about 10 degrees above the horizon.  The object did appear to have a slight bluish or greenish tint and was quite bright.  The tail seemed to have the same property of a comet as best as I can describe. The object though appeared to be at a great distance from my location, but still appeared proportionaly large from my perspective. I thought this interesting, mentioned it to my girlfriend who was riding with me.  She had not observed it.  I thought nothing more of this until listening to The Art Bell show this morning at 3 am, and heard the reports from Seattle from Mr. Peter Davenport. I felt compelled to report this in some manner. Observer is a 32 year old profesional non-drinking single male<n>

Right around 9:10 PM we were walking in a SE direction when I noticed a bright light in the sky but partially obscured by a tree. The light appeared to be about the size and brightness of (Jupiter?), the bright planet currently visible in the southward sky, but pale green in color. I soon noticed the light moving toward Seattle (west) and at a downward angle. I told my wife to look. We both witnessed it as it streaked into full view for about three more seconds. The light appeard to get bigger and brighter as it moved and had a small orange-red tail. The largest the light ever got was about the size of an eraser held at arms length. It seemed to disappear or burn out about 30 degrees in the horizon. My wife&#39;s first thought was that it was a firework because of its color and brightness. I believed it was too far and too low in the horizon plus moved too far and fast to a Roman Candle. It basically looked like a very bright shooting star - but green.<n>

Seem to recall a short trail, not like a meteors&#39; train, however.

The size was like something 5 inches in diameter, held at arm&#39;s length.  Surface was dull metallic, illuminated by city lights, a pink glow.  It was completely silent and had no exhaust, no visible running lights.  Path was a slight arc across sky towards southwest.  It lasted approx. 1 minute. I immedi- ately called a MUFON field investigator, reported details at approx 9:05. I am a trained observer with a private pilot&#39;s license, a graduate of the MUFON Field Investigator Class, and was wearing lenses which correct my vision to 20/20.<n>

I was minutes away from viewing Rivera Live on CNBC which starts at 21:00, that&#39;s how I took note of the time. I was looking out the picture window into the sky as I often do checking out the helicopters and airplane lights in the distance when all of a sudden what looked like a falling star fell about a 1/2 a mile in front of me falling from the North to the Southeast. It was green &#34;fireball&#34; emitting a gold haze with a gold tail. It fell for approx. 6 to 8 seconds and then just disappeared. I immediately yelled to my husband that I had just seen something that looked like a falling star except that it was green and big. I said it was something strange, something I&#39;d never seen before. The size of it: If I held my hand out at arms length and put my thumb and forefinger together and looked through them, it would be the size of a 1&#34; diameter marble.<n>

The last was still being created as I watched.  I live in view of Portland Int. airport and a military air strip near by, and have not in the decades I&#39;ved lived here seen that many con trails at once. I also noted it because while they did appear to be very high, I could see the craft better than I thought I should be able to, as though they were unusally large, they seemed longer than they should be, but they were so high I could not hear any sound from them at all. I noted it in the back of my mind and went on about my business, until Art Bell came on and I heard about the large sighting in Seattle a couple of hours later.   Wondered then to myself if someone may have known what was about to happen, and was on their way to take a look. Then later when the caller from vancouver said he&#39;d seed that unusally moving &#39;craft&#39; at about 14:00 that afternoon I really became convinced I should report this, just in case anyone else noted unusal military looking activity that night.<n>

Silvery to almost translucent, pulsating between visible and near invisible.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was driving west on Route 9 in Westborough MA at 1359 23 Sep 98 when a truck in front of me let out a puff of smoke.  The visible smoke did not disipate as I expected. My eyes were then drawn to what was really happening in the sky. What I saw was what appeared to be a funnel cloud rotating and shifting while changing density dark to light. Then this appearant funnel formed into a more roundish but not perfect round object that moved from right to left and then back left to right. Again this movement was accompanied by darkish to near translucent appearance. After just a few seconds the object appeared to me perfectly round, and pulsating between silver and near translucent.  It was if the object was trying to be invisible but not able to achive it totally. I am a very creditable person, a simple software sales person. I can&#39;t believe something like this has happened to me. There are no drugs involved here. I am a former member of the Air Force Intelligence Command who was in the right place at the right time on my way back to the office from a simple lunch meal.<n>

Then I realised that I was in the middle of Texas and the lights of the nearest town were not even in view so it was unlikely that anyone was sitting in that field setting off a single bottle rocket. Also, it was too big and travelling downwards from left to right trailing sparks behind. It was a baseball sized ball of green light trailing yellow and reddish sparks. So then I assumed I saw a meteorite, although I&#39;ve never seen one before, but I thought it was weird that I did&#39;nt see it hit the ground.  I was listening to Art Bell a few hours later and heard all sorts of reports about similar sounding sights, except I had felt that this was smaller and closer to me.  Of course, in the dark it&#39;s impossible to tell, but now I suppose that if it was actually very far away, that would explain why it disappeared, if it was falling behind a distant hill.  The land was pretty flat but there were a few hills. I&#39;ve seen shooting stars, but they are obviosly as distant as stars and in the upper sky, this was definitely within the atmosphere. As for my background info., I&#39;m 27, a bartender in New Orleans, and was travelling home from vacation with my boyfriend.  He did not see it because it was gone before I could say &#34;wow, look at that!&#34;<n>

While leaving for work on a crisp, cold, clear, starlight morning I stopped before entering my jeep. Above, against a starlight night, I saw a green-white orb traveling southeast through the sky. It was twice as bright as the North Star, soundless, and traveling half as fast as a shooting star--much faster than any plane I&#39;ve ever seen. There were no other navagation or strobe lights on it. I was alone and thought it odd. I felt no strange paralysis or anything like that; I just watched it fluedly traverse the sky in one straight, quick, silent slash then I went to work. I only saw this one object. It seemed far away, high in the sky, much too bright to be a star, and much too fast to be a plane. I&#39;m a well educated person and a realist. I don&#39;t know if there are any spooky grey beings out there or what our government is testing.

I was facing towards the Northwest and suddenly something streaked across the sky directly above my position.  It was heading in a Northeast to Southwest direction.  The sighting was very brief, maybe a half second, as the object moved very quickly.  At first I did not think much of what I had seen.  After further consideration of the event, I began to realize that I could not figure out what it could possibly have been with any certainty. When I had originally sighted the object, my first thought was that it must have been a shooting star.  I then rejected this idea as it did not &#39;burn and spark&#39; as other shooting stars that I had seen in the past.  The object had been, in fact, rather dull in appearance.  It had no luminescence to speak of and my best guess is that it was only illuminated by ambient light from the ground.  There are streetlights and other less intense light sources in the immediate area.  The night was clear and visibility in the sky was quite good.  The moon, if I remember correctly, was low on the horizon and not full.  I do remember that whatever the moons&#39; aspect, its light did not interfere. I had been rather pleased by the clarity of the stars and this is why I had been looking skyward in the first place.  Dirtectly behind me was a streetlight that was approx. 120 feet away and I had faced away from it in order to see better. The best way to describe what I had seen is to say that it appeared to be a small orb or disc that was a dull, metallic color.  It had no external sources of light and did not emit any noticeable sound.  There was no trail or glow to the object.  As I had indicated previously, it appeared that ambient light was reflected from the object.  It looked rather dim/dull and was only visible for a brief instant.  This leads me to believe that it was travelling very low to the ground.  I had considered that it may have been a bird or bat.  I dismissed that notion also as its velocity was far greater than any bird or bat I had ever seen.  I also briefly thought that it may have been a airplane of some kind.  I again rejected that idea as the circumstances and my perceptions of the object strongly refuted this.  There is alot of low-flying air traffic in this area.  This is due to the nearby Air Force base and small commercial airport that share runways.  Mostly they are rather large commercial and military planes with a few small, private planes and jet fighters.  However, the vast majority of the air traffic are large planes.  The Air Force base is part of the Strategic Air Command. The only other information that I can provide is that, by my estimation, the object covered 30-40 degrees across my line of sight.  The object appeared very suddenly and had disappeared just as quickly.  This reminded me of something flying low and only visible by ambient light from the ground.  The object moved in a very straight trajectory.  This is the best and most accurate description that I can provide of the events and observations on that occasion.  I do not completely rule out any possible explanation to what I saw that night.  I can say that, whatever I had witnessed, I am perplexed and had never seen anyhting similar.<n>

A streak of light appeared directly in front of my view facing East. The width of the tail seemed larger than an average meteor tail, and had a greenish blue tinge to it.  The head of the source of light seemed to be fuzzy in nature, more like a fireball. The time I have given is only an estimate.<n>

At this point I noted an object moving rather slowly (speed est. 250mph) on a course of 250 degrees.  No sound came from the object.  It appeared a dull copper from below and was shaped like a very thin, elongated boomerang.  I thought it might be gease flying at night since several lakes are nearby--but no tell-tale calling amongst members of the flight could be heard.  I blocked low level lighting as best I could and observed the object make a slight 15 degree banking turn slightly to the WSW.  I lost sight of it against the background of a streetlight.  I hold a Masters Degree in Aeronautical Science, and have worked in the aerospace industry for several years.  I currently teach college level Astronomy.<n>

I immediatly noticed what at first appeared to be a very bright star low on the horizon.The object remained stationary and as I approached the definate V-shape became very clear. the object had 4 or 5 white lights on each arm of the V, totalling 8 or 10 lights in all. I travelled approximatly 10 blocks before no longer being able to see it as I passed it. As it was now behind me I continued on to work. This road was very well travelled and I am sure someone else must have seen this also as it was so low as to be the size of my thumbnail with individual light clearly visable.<n>

At first I thought it was an airplane landing light but it was far too bright. The Object was about a quarter the size of the full moon. It appeared at about 45 degrees above the horizon and disappeared at about 10 degrees above the horizon. When I first saw it it looked like the tail was comming from the front end of it and then it formed into a ball then it formed a tail out of the back end like a normal metor. This all took place in just a few seconds. The object was a very very bright white. It looked like it was going toward the Northwest, it looked like it was about 10 degrees West of due North. I heard a caller on Art Bell&#39;s show describe the object as green but he also said that was through his visor, I am assuming this was the same object I saw. The object appeared to me as if it punched throught the atmosphere or something, thats why I saw the tail at the front first then turn to a ball then form a tail out the back.<n>

One of my friend and I, after watching it for a while, turned around and rode AT TOP SPEED back to our house. My other friend and my brother followed us after about 10 seconds.

The show location was at the Ford Development Center/proving ground in Dearborn Mi.  The weather that night was exceptional.  Clear skies, low humidity, mid 70&#39;s in temperature.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It is important to note that the show consisted of two musical acts.  They were country musicians Deanna Carter, and Alan Jackson.  There was no light show, no laser stage lights. Nothing of that nature at all.  That is important for me to mention due to the fact I have had several people attempt to tell me what I saw, when in fact they were not in attendance.  More then one person has said that what I saw was due to stage lights.  Nothing could be further from the truth.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Between acts all the stage lights were turned off and no lights at all were directed at or coming from the stage while the equipment change was made for the next act.  Most people at this point were standing around talking and waiting for Alan Jackson, the main act, to take the stage.  My girlfriend and I had brought a blanket to sit on.  During the equipment change on stage we had both laid back and were relaxing in silence while we both looked up into the night sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was at this point, while laying on the blanket looking up into the night sky I noticed something off to my left in my peripheral vision moving slowly across the sky.  The first impression I had was that a flock of birds were flying over the crowd.  As I watched further I realized that these were not birds but a group of what I can only describe as dull white orbs moving in what I would call a random pattern.  I do not know the exact number but I would put it at about a dozen or so orbs of dull whitish light.  They were not bright, but more of a dull luminescence is the way I can best describe them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I watched the group of lights move over the crowd, my best estimate is that they were at about 100-200 feet or so above ground level. All of the sudden the lights broke from their random looking pattern. They all began to move in what I can only describe as an amazingly fluid, aerodynamically impossible manner. This is the part that is like trying to describe a vivid dream to someone. No matter how I try I cannot convey how absolutely strange and otherworldly their movements were. The only thing I can think of that might describe their movements would be dolphins swimming underwater. It was such a smooth, fluid, acrobatically impossible way of movement I was stunned.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What happened next was even more amazing. At the exact same time the orbs broke from their amazingly fluid movements and formed a perfect looking circle. They held that pattern for perhaps a half minute or so. Then they broke from that pattern and resumed their fluid looking aerial acrobatic display. Then as suddenly they resumed the random pattern I had first saw them in. From there they continued in the same direction I had first saw them. I watched them as they proceeded to move at their original slow pace until they vanished down the horizon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At this point I looked to my right to see if my girlfriend had observed what I had. She was looking from the sky to me and she asked me something to the effect of &#34;WHAT THE HELL WAS THAT?&#34; My girlfriend was a person who did not believe in anything that couldn&#39;t be explained logically. She was an atheist, and as far as UFO&#39;s were concerned they were the for looney people.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Later that night when we returned to my house I told my sister and her boyfriend who were staying at my place what we had seen. They listened and I got the feeling that they were not impressed with my description of this otherworldly sight I was describing. Well the next morning when my sister got to her job at Ford Motor company she met one of her coworkers in the elevator.  The first thing out of my sisters coworkers mouth was &#34;I went to that concert last night and I saw the most amazing lights in the sky I have ever seen&#34;  She proceeded to tell my sister what she had seen and it was obviously the exact same thing I had seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have over the years been looking for anybody online who was from this area who may have seen something like this that same night.  One of your reports is from a man in Westland Mi, not far from where I saw what I did.  He reports that he saw something on 9/22/1998 at 12:10 AM.  Which in fact would place it on the same night I saw what I did on 9/21/1998 at about 9:00 PM or so.  So it seems that in SE Michigan on the night of 9/21/1998, and the morning of 9/22/1998 there was some very serious activity in this area.<n>

These were observed while I was in the shower with no inside light and no outside lights on in the retirement community. I didn&#39;t notice them until they were more than half way across my field of vision. Ten minutes later when I stepped outside to look at the sky where they had been an aircraft suddenly zoomed by going in the same direction but lower in the sky with steady bright lights and making a very loud noise. Details of this craft also were not seen but there was a light at the front and one much lower and further back giving the impression a third light may have been on the opposite side thereby giving it a triangular shape.  This aircraft had much greater speed than the others.<n>

Followed  by three black helicopters<n> <n><n> <n><n> A huge craft that from a distance looked like a blimp, came from Boynton Canyon, flying toward the Southeast. It flew by our back deck at a distance of about 500&#39; above the homes in our 55 or over community. There were three of us sitting on our back deck drinking ice tea. It was huge - at least the size of 4 football fields. It was lit up with windows similar to those you see in a ferry. They were stacked 4 to 5 levels high and all lit up. It was silent, but it had wings and also a huge turbo type engine in the back. It also had some metal girder type extensions. It moved slowly, and we really got a good view. None of us moved, as it moved farther away we got up and watched it head toward the Village of Oak Creek. Following behind were three black helicopters, seemingly escorting it along. My husband would not let me call anyone or report it for fear of men in black. Enough time has passed that I don&#39;t think we have to worry about that now. To this day, all three of us can draw it and remember it in detail. It was the most amazing thing we&#39;ve ever seen. Nothing was ever reported in the paper or on the news. I&#39;ve heard that others saw it in the Village and I did report it to Peter Gersten, a ufo lawyer, and Rob Meyer a UFO guide  in Sedona, Arizona.<n>

Different heights and distances from my position. NOT stars, planets or aircraft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have been witnessing a recurring sighting of something in the sky over Redding since the 21st of September.  The object(s) are still appearing as of tonight, the 12th of October.  These objects have been witnessed by three of my neighbors as well as my Grandmother, my Nephew and another friend.  The first object appears in the western sky at around 7:10 PM.  It slowly, almost imperceptibly, traverses the sky in a diagonal, downward track until it reaches the crest of a mountain called Boley Mountain which is roughly 6 miles from my location. It then disappears on the other side of the mountain.  Within three minutes, the object, or another identical object, appears in the northern sky, roughly 30 degree&#39;s above the horizon.  From this position, it tracks opposite from its path in the west until by 12:30 AM, it is very high in the northeast.  The object does not get much higher and does not move east or west.  The latest I have watched it is 2:30 AM.  At that time it had moved slightly south.  I got up at 4:30 AM about four nights ago and saw nothing but stars, the moon and planets.  I noticed on the 28th that another, seemingly identical object would appear in the eastern sky at the same time this object moved.  The eastern object must be either over or just east of Redding Municipal Airport.  On October 4th I started finding more of these objects in different positions around my location or encircling Redding.  On the 5th, I counted 16 that I could see.  These objects can only be identified as bright white, green and/or blue and red lights with the red light appearing to pulse or rotate around something.  Very reminisent of the old police &#34;bubble gum&#34; lights or maybe lights reflecting off of one of those aluminum christmas trees.  None of the witnesses, including myself, have been able to see a discernable shape.  I am using a fairly new pair of 20X50 Tasco binoculars to view this.  Not the best but I all I have available.  My neighbor, who was actually the first to see this, has tried to view the object through his 35mm camera using a 300mm telephoto lens.  Still could not make out what it is.  He took some time-lapse photographs of the first object but is not confident of the outcome since all he had was 200 speed film.  I have snapped several photos using a Kodak Max one-time use camera.  I know these will either be blank pictures or of poor quality but they are at least pictures.  Since I am now dealing with so many of these things it is difficult for me to list every objects position and behaviour.  Some of the new ones to the southwest actually appeared very close to the ground. However, being night time and not knowing the distance of my binoculars yet, they could have been thousands of feet in the air.  I think they were close to the ground because of my location and knowing the area they appeared to be over.  I have sensitivity to bright car lights so could not investigate even though I wanted to. I am a white male, 47 years old and have spent the last 17 years working with computers, 14 of those with Tandy Corporation in Texas. I am currently a private consultant.  I do take medications but none would cause this level of hallucination.<n>

Off to the south I saw a silver cylindrical shape which was horizontal and appeared to be a jet but was moving very slowly as it moved across the horizon north it changed shape and became more like a &#34;saucer&#34; continuing north it flattened out, wavered back and forth sideways and the completely disappeared into thin air.  The sky was completely blue.  There were no clouds for the object to disappear behind.  The object was flying in front of a mountain range which was visible behind the object.<n>

It was in the east just north of being over head. I watched it move from the east until it was out of sight in the west. It travelled just below the cloud level which appeared to be at the height of the Sierra Nevada mountains, about 12,000 ft. The clouds were moving west to east. I watched it for about 2 minutes, at its closest it was 3/16 inch in diameter at arms lenght. It travelled in a straight line at a constant speed. It made no sound. It appeared to change color from white to black and back to white like it was winking, and when it moved in line with the sun it reflected light like silver metal also winking. I work for the Post Office and I was on vacation taking photographs. Unfortunately I was unable to take a picture because I use a 4by5 view camera. A freind of mine also whitnessed the event.<n>

It was still visable for about twenty seconds then again shot off to the north and disappeared.  It was more than likely outside the atmosphere and looked no different than the North Star.  I witnessed this object zig-zag and manuevor.  Something was controlling this object.  No sattilite can manuevor at that rate of speed.  This object would move quicker than my own eyes.  I watch the skies periodically and never have I seen something in this nature.  I live by Dulles Airport so I know what should and shouldn&#39;t be flying around my house.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was about 10:00pm on Wycombe St. in Centreville Va.  My french friend and I were observing the traffic of airplanes above when something caught both our attention at the same time.  An object very far away moving at first very slowly.  This object had the appearance no different from what a star would look like.  At first I thought it was just a sattilite until the object moved very quickly to the left and to the right and then to the left again.  Then the object remained stationary for about two or three seconds.  My friend and I woke up the neighborhood with obsenities.  About that time the object zipped to a more northern area in the sky very very fast.  Right after that it shot off out of our site within the blink of an eye.  I will never forget that experience.<n>

When I looked at the moon, I saw three UFO in triangular shape.  At the beginning I thought they were only stars but suddenly they started to travel very fast in different directions for few minutes and then they traveled so far that disappear in the ski just like that.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This was not the first time that I have seen strange movements.  When I was in Boqueron beach (Cabo Rojo, PR) some years before this event, I saw a fireball coming from the ski and going inside the water.  It was late in the night.  This event was so fast that probably nobody else saw it but me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I still do not understand how I could see that fireball since it was very fast.<n> <n><n> <n><n> People never believe what I have seen.

They were to the east, above Burien I suspect, about 8 degrees in the sky, and the size of a pea when held at arm&#39;s length.  I tried to make them out, but although they weren&#39;t distorted or fuzzy, there was no discernible detail other than the strange luster.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The objects climbed upward at a diagonal to the north.  I watched them until they disappeared.  They didn&#39;t zoom off or climb into the cloud cover, as there wasn&#39;t any that day, they just seemed to pop out of existence one by one, like each one became invisible in turn.  The curious thing is that even though they appeared to climb, they never got smaller in size.  They weren&#39;t moving very fast.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that date of the event is approximate.  PD))<n>

I have tried to establish the approximate date. I was outside my home, cutting hedges on the East side of my home and took a break.  I was looking at the sky admiring the light clouds and blue sky.  There were 2 cloud levels.  One up high, maybe 12-15,000 feet.  A lower one, that was approximately 8,000 feeet.  I know it was fairly high, as the lower clouds were wispy, not stacked cumulo Nimbus clouds.  I also live 2 miles from Willard Airport, outside Champaign, IL so I am used to watching planes fly overhead as they use the transponder here at the airport. I had on sunglasses due to the brigth sun, and my eyes are sensitive to it.  I was looking East and suddenly observed a round object appear out of nowhere.  The object was circular in shape. I observed the object appear to make a lazy left turn.   The object appeared to be a dirty copper in color and was huge.   I state the object appeared to make a left turn as I observed the underside of the craft.  It appeared to swing up.  The underside tilted up towards me at an approximate 30 degree angle.  I could definitely see almost the whole underside of the craft, and see it&#39;s circular shape.  The object then slid back flat, and disappeared !!   I couldn&#39;t believe it. Thinking about it, I could not see the craft until it tilted.  This has bothered me.   Why couldn&#39;t I see it until it tilted, and then after it returned it disappeared again.  It was large enough, and close enough that I should have seen something !!! Using basic geometry I figured out it&#39;s basic size.   A cloud level at 8,000, even less, and an approximate angle of 45 degrees in the sky one can reach some conclusions.   I figure the object was approximately 2 1/2 miles from me.   I live in a small town, and estimate the size of this craft to be approximately 100 feet in diameter, based on comparing barns from approximately 2 1/2 miles away.   Smaller then a full moon. Would be approximately the size of  full moon and add a half moon to it.  Larger than a half dollar held at arms length. I declined to report this for fear of what our gov&#39;t is doing.  I work in law enforcement and don&#39;t need to be labeled crazy.   I have dated a young woman who has a family member in  the military.  He told her to stay away from Internet sites that delt with UFO&#39;s, as they are all monitored by the gov&#39;t.  When pressed for mor info, he refused to answer more.  I do listen to you on Art Bell.  I think he&#39;s doing great work, as you are.    Recently I heard you on Art&#39;s show and decided to report this.    Thanks<n>

We had been talking about strange light activity my aunt has been seeing in the sky over the mountains of the region (most of the area is mountainous) when we noticed a strange set of lights moving towards our position from above the tree line approximately east of our position. The craft was shaped like an egg except it was wider than it was tall, it wasnt as round as an egg rather more flattened. At first you couldnt hear any sound but for some reason as it came closer we could hear wind as if the craft itself was causing a disturbance in the air with its motion through it. The craft as it approached was about 40 to 50 feet off the ground, just above the tree tops. It was comprised of what seemed to be gun metal colored panels and had blue and white lights in succesion around its entire circumfrence. Im not exactly sure if the panels were gun metal colored but they appeared that way in the light that the craft itself was emitting (it was dark and the only reason we saw it was because the lights on its sides illuminated its shape enough for it to be seen). Id say the craft was maybe 250 to 300 feet away from us and appeared to be quite large, probably the width of about two and a half black hawk helicopters side to side. The craft was silent except for the sound of wind moving through trees under the craft (I know what helicopters sound like and this thing did not emmit such a loud sound, rather literally the sound of wind moving through trees). It flew in an easterly direction away from us and then over the mountain. Id estimate its speed at about 35 to 40 miles an hour because i was able to get a good look at it as the event happened. My mother, my aunt, and myself looked at each other to make sure we had all seen the same thing because during the event we were all speechless. Thats something my mother doesnt like to talk about (shes quite christian and doesnt want to believe its something unexplainable) and my aunt stays adamant that she sees crafts like that and strange lights in the mountains on an average basis and im inclined to believe her, she claims that the lights have been a common occurance since she was a child. Im inclined to believe her because when i happened to mention me seeing strange lights in northern new hampshire to her once she told me about her personal experience with seeing lights in the mountains.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.

Boulder City is in the east-west flight path for McCarran Airport in Las Vegas.  Many planes fly over every day and night.  I&#39;ve been out in the night before and never do these flights ever really stop.  This night, I was watching stars and planes through binoculars.  I put the binocs down as the news came on the radio.  I noticed there were no planes overhead at that moment.  Then, while looking straight up (at Casseiopia, slightly to the back of me) I saw what looked like a V-shaped constellation, but it was moving. It was absolutely silent (while every plane can be heard in the still night air), it seemed about as big as my fist held straight up, and was headed due south.  Lake Mead lies directly north of where I live.  By the time I got my binocs up to look closer, I just barely located the craft before it disappeared over the top of my house and I never did get a good close-up look at it.  Within just a few minutes, the regular flight traffic reappeared.  Could this have been a Stealth craft?<n>

I was traveling northbound on I-5 and exactly at 23:51 hrs. (check clock) I seen this brilliantly lit greenish-white, perfectly round fireball. It was moving at a very fast pace at a downward-slanted position. Disappeared behind the mountains, but seemed to be headed towards Edwards Air Base in Lancaster. Really didn&#39;t believe what I was seeing and ask the driver in front of me if he had seen it. He said he hadn&#39;t seen anything, no one was going to call him crazy. But I know it was real, the cb radio has never been so quiet and nothing was said for minutes. I wanted to get off the hwy. and call Art Bell, but remembered he had a repeat show on that night. I&#39;m really not sure if it was 9/18 or 9/23, but diffenently one of those days. By now I&#39;m watching the skies like crazy and 2 weeks later I was coming off Tehachipi Mtn., west bound on hwy.58 into Bakersfield, it was cloudy night, but there was this one star like object in the sky in the southern direction. It&#39;s light kept going on and off like it was sending some kind of morse code, then finally went out and disappeared. This went on for about for almost 20 minutes. I really felt it was talking to something. If you wish to contact me at anytime, I will gladly pay for the call (see occ. section for info). In the meantime, I&#39;ll be watching the skies.Keep up the good work.<n>

After proposing to my girlfriend and drinking hot cocoa, we layed on our backs and relaxed just looking at the night sky, when we noticed a black triangle craft pass directly overhead going N.W. to S.E. this craft was definitely within hearing range.  It was at a pretty low altitude. This craft made no noise! The only lights we noticed were very faint almost non-visual dots down the front bottom sides. This craft was flush w/ the night sky, meaning, this thing could have definitely been cruising over the city all night long with very few if any people noticing it.  My biggest suprise overall was definitely the fact that there was no noise coming from this craft at its altitude. Any human craft I know of would definitely have been heard at this position in the air above us.<n>

No tail or explosion.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was traveling south on I-5, just passing the Del Mar Race Track. My friend was in the car with me.  I saw a green light floating above the area where the race track is, near the coast.  It moved east while decending, then it moved west.  It was the green color that caught my eye, I had heard on Art Bell&#39;s show of people having sightings of green flashes.  I grew up on the coast and the only green flashes I had heard of were the ones that appeared at the time of an intense sunset, but I knew that those were optical illusions.  So I was interested in this ob- ject in the sky that was green.  It was star like in size, but too low to be celestial.  And it wasn&#39;t flashing like any aircraft would be. By the time it caught my friend&#39;s attention it had turned white.  We both watched it travel west a little further then it just went out. The sky wasn&#39;t too dark that we wouldn&#39;t have seen something even with- out a light on it.  So we both searched for something but were amazed that nothing was there. Shortly after that you were on the radio announcing all those calls you received.  I finally found some spare time to submit my report.

Last year the same light went horizonal across the sky. It was traveling faster than a jet. Very fast, but straight. This light just showed up from nothing! It was very bright and green and pulse down slowly down to ground.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Green pulse seen in Diamond Bar last Friday night. I did not report it until I heard people in Seattle have seen one. I thought you should know. It is the second green pulse light see in a year over Diamond Bar. The one Friday night at appox. 9:00 showed up very low like 1500 feet in distance. It was stopped in air, and went down toward earth. The area I figure was a hills and cows pasters. It was a green, light that flashed also white, but pulsed more green.<n>

It was shortly after dusk. It was dark but not yet pitch black. I was driving past the primary power distribution site for the local hydro power facility near Cornwall, Ontario, Canada. The facility is on the high ground about a mile from the road.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I noticed a bright shaft of light above this facility. I thought at first it might be a helicopter inspecting the transformers. The light was extremely bright and well defined. There was no sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I then realized that it was too wide for a normal spotlight - possible 100 feet wide.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The light then acted in a manner not possible with our technology. Still bright with well defined boundaries it began to slowly withdraw upward.  The object that it was withdrawing into was not visible.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Light in our technology is either on or off. A light beam as we know it cannot slowly withdraw. The light boundaries were too well defined to be a natural phenomenon. For this reason I believe I was witnessing a paranormal event.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My wife also witnessed this sighting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.

North to south.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was looking at the night sky when I observed a roughly triangular shaped object whose margins were unspecific. The &#34;object&#34; was transparent in the fact that I could see the bright stars of the Milky Way behind it. The night was quite clear and the star feild exceptionally sharp. As the object passed across my feild of vision the stars behind it tended to blur somewhat in comparison to the stars outside the margins of the &#34;object&#34;. There were no other visible lights except for the stars. The trajectory was from north to south. I am a Licensed Practical Nurse. I am a trained observer by profession.<n>

I was letting my dog out one last time for the night and like usually I glanced up at the stars.  I was looking to the east at what I think was a planet.  Not sure though. I noticed the object next to it.  I thought it was a star and I staired at it for about 7 minutes. Then all of a sudden it began to move slowly and shot off into the horizon.  It travelled eastward out of my view.  Its speed was incredible.  I have never really told anyone about this, but I thought it would be good for someone to know.  Maybe somehow...someway...someone else saw this.<n>

Due to it being rather chilly out that evening they lit a nice camp fire to keep warm and talk about the days events. She said it was a beautiful night as the sky was clear and they were able to view the stars above.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The witness said way in the distance to the north you were able to see the sky lit up from the city lights in Prince George. Straight in front of them was the Fraser River and across on the other bank was a tall stretch of trees. Approximately 100 feet above the tops of the trees sat a &#34;huge&#34;, pulsating glowing orange/yellow ball of light which appeared to be swaying slightly. They said it came out of nowhere !! Looking at something so large and very close they all got frightened and all asked one another what is that.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The light stayed in it&#39;s position for a while and then it started moving away in the opposite direction from the witnesses towards the southwest rather quickly. Also the lady said there was no sound coming from the object, yet they could hear the odd car traveling the highway. The estimated the object to be twice a large as a full moon and of course as it moved further away is grew smaller in size due to the distance between the witnesses and the object. Something else she told me, as the circular object moved away, it did not shoot high into the night sky, but flew away in a straight line. I asked if the object lit up the area, she said no.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Everyone figured they observed it for approximately a couple of minutes, although the witness felt they had watched it for a life time due to the strangeness of it. They were going to check the fishing nets that were set that night, but after seeing this thing, they did not want to go anywhere near the river and went back to the tents. When they all returned home the next day the woman called the local Prince George radio station and told them what they had witnessed, as she wanted to know if anyone else had reported the same object, but no reports came in.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thank you to the witnesses for their report.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Brian Vike, Director HBCC UFO Research Phone/Fax 1 250 845 2189 email: hbccufo@telus.net Website: http://www.hbccufo.com<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We express our gratitude to Brian Vike for submitting this report.

A smaller green light departed from the red light, moving quite erratically through the sky,while the red light remained stationary.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am an Aviation Safety Inspector with the FAA.On Sept. 15,1998 at 11:30pm a friend called me to say that she really believed that she was watching a UFO from her waterfrount home,near where I live. I went outside and did not see anything. I then drove down to the boat harbor down the street where I observed a large red light moving very erratically across the sky. It was utterly silent. The light varied in altitudes, the lowest point being approximatly 400ft agl.The red light became stationary and a smaller green light emerged from it and moved in an almost grid like pattern,moving quite fast. The red light remained stationary while the green light moved in all directions around it. This lasted for 40 mins. The green light then dissapeared in what appeared to be in the red light. The large red light then shot straight up in the sky with a right hand trajectory The night was clear, calm and about 40 degrees with a multicipy of stars.<n>

Off to the top left a blue/green ray of light.  Every 30 seconds (Aprrox) two white lights from the sides went off.  The location of the whit lights was quite a distance from the bright light.  A much smaller green/red light came off this main light and flew off toward Lena Point.  The green/red light came back, flew under the bright light and flew iradically over the airport area.  I watched this from 11:00PM to 12:30AM with my two children and we finally fell asleep.  At 11:30 I called my friend and she went down to a store called Deharts and watched this with some other people that were standing there. The bright light would bob around, go straight up, left, right and eventually went much higher.  I will mail a map and try to draw for you what I saw.  I did not see an outline of this object as the light was so bright.  Juneau does not usually have clear skies and this night was very clear.<n>

I was about to leave my girlfriends house, when I noticed what appeared to be a neon orange doughnut slowly approaching from the south.  This object looked like a doughnut, round with a black center and made no noise at first.    As it got closer, it dropped a small blue ball of light that fell approx. 30-40 feet then went out.  It did this four times by the time it was overhead.  By now I had become quite excited (my girlfriend was crying like a wuss) and produced my lighter and began to flash it at the object which looked like it was less than 1000 ft above us.  After flashing my lighter a bunch of times, this thing stops. it didn&#39;t slow to a stop, it just stopped.  I stopped flashing my lighter and waited for something to happen.  It dropped another blue light, so I flashed my lighter again.  When I flashed my lighter at it, it moved pretty damn fast to the left and then to the right, then changed it&#39;s shape to a thin horizontal line and with a bang just like a car backfire, it shot away at an amazing speed and left a small cloud of white smoke that faded as fast as it appeared.  The bang that was heard woke my girl&#39;s dad up.  We told him what we saw and what it did.  He told us we probably saw a military aircraft that was dropping flares.  What a crock of you know what!  I am very military oriented, and I know that was no damn plane or jet we saw.  I also saw this same craft with ny mother about a year later.  Did the same thing (dropped blue balls of light) but this time it was cloudy and it made a sharp angled left turn into a cloud before anyone else got to see it. If anyone else has seen a this craft or one like it, please report it!  I would like to hear if anyone else has seen this!!<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

It was partly cloudy and we could only see the object for about 10 seconds before it went behind the clouds. It was around 2200 Hrs. In the middle of Sept. There was only one object that we could see.<n>

It was like strobeing lights coming out of the sky, but the lights stayed in the same spot for over an hour and stopped ever 112 seconds and started back up again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was a cloudy night and my husband and I decided to sit out on our back porch to watch, what we thought, was lightening. After watching it for a while, we noticed that the strobeing lights never moved from the same small section of clouds and that there was no thunder or noise. Strobeing rays flashed downward out of the clouds erraticly, from the same spot for over an hour, stopping every minute and 12 seconds, just to start back up again. Every single time that we timed it, it was exactly the same spacing, between the pauses. Then all of a sudden, at around 23:??pm, they stopped. To tell you the truth, I have no idea what we were watching, except that it was very strange and that we have never seen it again, since that night. Note:  We live out in the country and there are no towns for miles in that specific, western direction. There is nothing out that way, other than other homes out in the country.<n>

I forget which month exactly because it was so long ago.  I believe it was in September.  The weather had just started getting cooler.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was in my house and had stepped out to get some air.  My house was located between three mountain ranges.  I saw the object appear over the mountain in the west.  The object seemed to be triangular in shape even though all I could see were lights.  There were 4 lights in all.  Two formed the back ends or base of the triangle.  While the other two were on the tip, one being smaller than the other.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first I thought it was a plane but it moved to slow to be any aircraft I know of.  I watched the object for about 5 minutes until it disappeared to the east.  The really odd thing was that during the entire time no sound was heard from the object.  Later that night there was a glow in the eastern sky as if there was a fire, but no fire was ever reported.  Being a small town news of things like fires spread quickly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The next day there was a significant increase of military aircraft flying all over.  I don&#39;t mean way up in the sky but literally right over the mountain tops.  This went on for about 2 weeks. I counted at least 4 different types of jet aircraft though I know not of what models they were.  I don&#39;t know if the two are connected but it seemed odd to me that the increase in activity happened the next day after I saw the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My mother and father also saw the object but my father to this day still believes it was a plane.  I do not. I know I haven&#39;t provided a lot of information, but I have told what I know.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date is approximate.  PD))<n>

We could not help noticing a very large egg shaped ring of steady yellow lights at tree top height, that was assending very slowly to the southwest.  It continued in a steady course for 2 ot 3 min&#39;s, maybe more as we watched.  It was absolutly silent.  No sound whatsoever!  It continued it&#39;s course until it was almost out of seight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Whatever was in the center of the ring could not be seen.  We figured it was a lighter then air craft...but there were no sound of engines.  Maybe a ballon...but I don&#39;t believe they are allowed to fly at night and the shape was not cosistent with a ballon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So to this day we don&#39;t know what the heck it was.  I would like to know if anyone, anywhere has observed anything like this, or if anyone may know what it could have been?  My wife, daughter and myself have only a passing interest in UFO&#39;s. We neither hunt them or venture an oppinion about ET&#39;s.  But after this encounter, we sure would like to know what the heck that thing was. Once you see something it is a huanting experience.  I only wish I had a flash camera.  It was so close I don&#39;t see how I could not have gotten a very good picture.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

It&#39;s movements were distinctly were not that of any conventional aircraft, that&#39;s for sure. There were also mutltiple colored flashing lights. As it got closer to me, I could make out a dark metallic hull. The actual lights were in a circular-disk shape. It went away, and came back about an hour later. When I got back to Wadley, I talked to a friend who saw it from town,10 miles away. The sky was very clear that night, visability was excellent.<n>

I had been at just gotten to work and had time to spare the set and it was dark the parking lot lights had not come on yet so the sky was pretty clear.  There were no clouds, it was a perfect evening.  I had glanced around a bit and was going to grab my book, when I saw a plane in the sky which looked like either a medium sized prop plane or a private jet.  Behind this plane about 50 to 100 feet or so was glowing red ball.  The plane could not be that long for the altitude it was flying at.  Behind the glowing red ball was what looked to be 3 helicopters in formation.  I was able to tell they were helicopters because the lights on the tail were flickering from the tail rotor.  The flew from east to west until they dissappeared over the tree tops.  I tried in ernest to find someone to witness what I had just seen but again I was early and no one was around in time to see it.<n>

I just recently found this website and thought I would post the experience.  Again I&#39;m not sure what I saw but I know it wasn&#39;t anything that could be explained at the time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> One night I decided to go outside and cool off on the patio.  I looked up and started to star gaze to pass the time when I noticed that the stars&#39; pattern flickered in and out almost like someone was moving a huge rectangle of glass across the sky.  The size of the anomaly was pretty decent, about the size of a large passenger air plane.  The weird thing about this is that there was no sound distortion in the air, so I knew it wasn&#39;t a plane or big helicopter, and there was no wind so it wasn&#39;t as if there was some strange item blowing across the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I watched the glass-rectangle thing start to cross the horizon, it looked almost as if it paused, then moved again in stops and starts.  I decided then to go inside to grab something to assist in viewing it better like my binoculars or video camera, but when I came out the pattern was gone.  There were no lights, no oblong shapes, no sudden heat, and no repeat of what I saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Just thought I&#39;d send this up in case anyone had ever seen something like this before.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness provides no contact information.

9/15/98 18:30|New York City (Manhattan)|NY|Triangle|10 minutes|Object zig zagging east to west and stopping in distance turned out to be huge triangle with many lights when it flew directly overhead|9/12/03|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/031/S31409.html|165|ndxe199809| Object zig zagging east to west and stopping in distance turned out to be huge triangle with many lights when it flew directly overhead<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was headed to dinner break with my partner (i was driving) heading downtown on Ninth Avenue around 56th Street when we both noticed a light behaving strangely in the sky. It was just around dusk and must have been in late summer. We took our break at 7:00 pm and were about three miles from our destination in heavy traffic. We were both used to seeing planes and helicopters in the sky as NYC gets a lot of air traffic and the area where we were looking in lower Manhattan was a popular flight path. But this thing was zig zagging in the sky and then coming to a complete stop. It seemed impossible. My partner is a veteran of the armed forces and he and i had never discussed the subject of ufo&#39;s. We kept our eye on the object while speculating as to what kind of plane could be capable of that kind of flight and why it would be doing that in what is a heavy air traffic corridor but could come up with nothing. We continued to drive south, in the direction of the object when we saw it change path. While it had been zig zagging from east to west and back again it suddenly started to head north in our direction. We were stopped at the red light and i cannot tell you how but it must have been moving very fast because it just seemed like all of sudden it went from an indistinguishable bright object to a huge triangle with many, many round lights on the bottom of it and it was directly overhead. My partner and i each had our heads out our respective windows just saying &#39;what the @#&amp;@!% is that thing!?&#39;. There so many lights. There must have been three rows of lights following the shape of the triangle. The lights were completely round, big and gave no glare. We could make out no landing gear, no windows and it made no sound. It was dark silver or gray-silver in color. No one on the street was looking up but this woman in a jeep who was stopped at the light next to us (we were high up in a van) looked up when she saw our expressions and she got the same look we must have had, laughing and yet dumbfou! nded at the same time. The light changed and the object continued north overhead and we went to work and told our supervisor who didn&#39;t really believe us. But i swear this really happened. To this day, if you walk on the streets of NYC you will see that New Yorkers just do not look up. I can&#39;t explain why neither my partner or i didn&#39;t yell at people to look up, but i think we were just too shocked and trying to make sense of what were seeing and then the light changed and it was gone behind us. I think it was huge because we could see it so clearly when it passed over us, yet we hadn&#39;t seen it descend and must have been fairly high up. It&#39;s hard for me to speculate on this as i have no clue about how to calculate distance and size in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My partner and i were doing outreach with the homeless at the time this happened. As i said he is a veteran of the army. I have done social work most of my life. We are both New Yorkers.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

The shape was an upside down &#34;L&#34; traveling left to right across the field of my vision at an estimated 1 mile distance and 1000 ft. altitude. Now the part that is so incredible: The speed was so tremendous that even what I believe to be somewhat distant moved 120 degrees or more across my field of vision in literally a blink of the eye. It was so fast that my eyes could hardly track it. If I had blinked, I probably would have missed it. It was faster than any plane or rocket I have ever witnessed. It must have been making many thousands of miles per hour! Until I saw your website, I was not aware that other people had seen similar colored light arrays. My memory is now uncertain as to date and time but the object remains in my mind. I probably can&#39;t add much more to this report if contacted but hope it has some value.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.  PD))<n>

I noticed that the big cumulo-nimbus cloud in front of me suddenly lit up.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I looked up, I saw about six or seven circular beams of light decending down through the cloud. They were all in a perfect circle and rotating counter clockwise (from a ground perspective). They fanned out away from each other slightly. They took up most of the whole cloud...very big...it was hard to estimate the size of the source, but it was quite large and the lights would have had to have been very strong to penetrate that far. I know because I have been a Professional Commercial Photographer for over 25 years.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object was behind the cloud because the light source was strongest at the top and disipated as it fell through the cloud....I would guess a couple of hundred feet below the cloud.  During this time the lights continued to rotate at an even moderate rate.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After I had viewed this for around 20 seconds, the whole thing, still rotating, did a pitch and yaw manouver and then slowly ascended back vertically, lighting up the whole cloud again as it departed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The size and behaviour of the light source ruled out any aircraft that I know as I have worked in very many aircraft and helicopters.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Although at no time did I see the object itself, the combination of vertical movement, rotation and pitch &amp; yaw was most unusual. As a photographer, I know that the light was decending through the cloud and not reflected from the ground or from any other source.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of sighting is approximate.

It was a sunny clear day,,i was out on the patio laying on a lounge chair and i happend to look up to a very clear blue sky,,,and saw a strange,,,oval silver object floating is best way i can describe this,,,,,it was floating fast from north to south,,,,,i watched it because i am out there all the time ,for twenty years or more and have never seen anything like this,,,it waw mesmerizing,,,,well i just told myself this must be a weather baloon, since i hadn&#39;t ever seen one before.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The dates i have given are approximate,,it was during the last part of the &#34;clinton&#34; administration. The president was comming here to stay at a place called, &#34;Chautauqua Instution&#34;, this is a place he had visited in the past as govenor. This was to be some kind of meeting with dignitaries, i am not sure of the excate reason for this visit. The president flew in a day or so before the first lady, and came in on &#34;air force one&#34; hellichopter. A day or two later, Hillary flew in. I was home that day,,,,,and as the chopper carrying the first lady flew towards my home,,,,i went outside,,,on my front walkway to try to get a look at it, as this is not something that normally happens. I saw the chopper , which was realy loud come into clear view,,,,,on another clear sky day,,,,not a cloud in the sky that day,,,so i could see this , and it was flying very low,,,what i saw next,,,,was what realy caught my attention,,,,,and i couldnt stop looking at this shiney silver,,,,orb,,flying directly above the &#39;air force one&#34; chopper, that is when i thought to myself,,,this couldnt possibly be a weather balloon as i had thought the first time i saw one of these in the sky. What realy bothered me,was that i would have thought that the air space in our area would have been closed , with the first lady and airforce one flying.  I went into the house,,,,,and i couldnt help but wonder,,,,,what in hell had i just seen. How is it possible, that something would be allowed to fly,,,this close,,,,to air force one. I thought about calling someone,,,but i didnt know who,,,so i let it go,,,thinking that ,,,i couldnt possibly be the only person to see this. Its just not possible. I never heard any reports on our news about anything seen by anyone that day. All i can say,,,,,,is that god as my witness,,,,i did see a sliver oval object flying with that chopper,, right over the first lady. If it werent for that, i think i would just ignore it,,,but i felt i had to say something to someone,,,the thought of this just doesnt totaly fade awa! y. I am sure that the dates i gave that are not excate, as i dont remember excately when it was,,,,but it was in the last part of his administration. I am sure that this date can be checked in the archives of our local news paper,&#34; the jamestown post journal&#34; I have to say,,,i said nothing for fear of being ridiculed,,,,this is not something that i realy belevied in. In all the years since,,,it has bothered me to not know if anyone else had reported this that day. If there is a chance that weather balloons would have been allowed to fly that day i sure wish i knew..so i would not think about the strange siteing. This is the first time i have ever in my life seen anything odd in the sky, i hope its the last.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was silent.  It slowed to a stop, it had a small cockpit on the south top side, I noticed light smoke inside the cockpit,it then started moving again and appeared to be having trouble, it headed down directly into the woods and disappeared from my view, it either landed or crashed into the area across the street known as the Cherry Farm, a neighbor and myself did a light search but never found it, this is private property and in my opinion it is still there. I have never talked about it because its hard to believe, I would be more than happy to have my neighbor talk to you and confirm this account.<n>
9/15/98 04:00|Salt Lake City|UT|Sphere|2 to 3 sec|UPDATE: Sept 15,98 sighting, MUFON report|3/2/04|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/035/S35201.html|171|ndxe199809| UPDATE: Sept 15,98 sighting, MUFON report<n> <n><n> <n><n> UPDATE: ---&lt;( MUOFN Summery Report By Guy Richardson MUFON Investigator.)&gt;---  I met with Mr. ((name deleted)), at his home Saturday, October 21,2000 to take his statement regarding the UFO sighting he witnessed on July 6,2000, the details of which are included in a separate report.<n> <n><n> <n><n> During the course of the interview Mr.((deleted)) recounted another sighting witnessed on 15 September 98 that had not been submitted to MUFON until now. While the reconstruction of a UFO sighting that occurred two years ago poses obvious problems for the investigator, it should be noted that the witness made a written account of the incident within days of the its occurrence. The information contained in this report corroborates remarkably well with the account of two years ago.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Mr.((name deleted)) web site is: http://rockc.tripod.com.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Subsequent to our first meeting, Mr. Rock accompanied me to the Westminster campus where we reviewed the sighting on location and made measurements to establish the distance to the UFO from the witness when first and last seen during the course of the sighting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There are ample points of geographic reference on the campus to establish, with a high degree of confidence, thedistance to the object; however, the estimation of the apperent size of the object is made with leddcertainty. The narrative that follows reflects calculations of size and distance based on these measurements that, while stated in exact figures, should be regarded as the best approximations obtainable without the aid of special equipment.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At 4:00AM on the morning of September 15 1998, Mr. Rock was working at Westminster College located at 1840 South, 1300 East, in Salt Lake City. He had stepped outside to throw away trash and sip some coffee. The witness stated that the night was cool, around 65 degrees; visibility was clear without any clouds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> While facing west, sipping coffee, he fired his laser pointer, which is used at work to identify areas that require cleaning, into the sky in the general direction of Jupiter+.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Within a minute or two of firing the laser, a gray, spherical object, calculated to be 70 feet in diameter*, appeared, in the western sky, hovering over an adjacent building at a distance of 260 feet from the witness at an altitude of 40 feet above the ground. The appearance of the object was sudden and was not preceded by movement from some other location.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It simply appeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Upon seeing the object, the witness turned off the laser pointer.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Mr.Rock stated that at that moment he was quite awed by what he was seeing and doesn&#39;t recall feeling or thinking much in the ensuing moment. The object sat completely motionless for 2 to 3 seconds then moved north toward the witness at a speed estimated to be 60 mph**. Witness stated that the object had no apparent period of acceleration; i.e. the object was motionless one instant and then moving at 60 mph the next, without any incremental increase in speed. He watched the object pass over him, headong northeast when lost from view as the object passed behind a building. The moment before the sphere moved out of view was when it was in closest proximity to the witness: 60 feet away at an altitude of 40 feet, with a calculated diameter of 58 feet*.<n> <n><n> <n><n> During these last few moments, the witness observed the underside of the sphere, which he described as &#34;Reddish, pinkish with pits and pings and very much crater-like&#34;.  He added that, apart from the bottom, the object was smooth,gray and featureless.  Witness also said he felt as if the object was aware of him.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As the object passed over the witness it went behind some trees and continued east behind a building.  The witness pursued the object on foot but before he could clear the tree cover he heard a bang and when he came into a clearing the object was nowhere to be seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Witness stated that he then returned to work and was very excited but was not able to relate the story to any of his co-workers because he doesn&#39;t speak much Spanish and they do not speak English.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Witness said that he was not able to sleep more than a couple of hours during the next two days because he was so excited and impressed with what he had seen.  After a couple days the witness contacted Peter Davenport, at the National UFO Reporting Center, who was given permission to tape the conversation.  That conver- sation was aired about a week later on the Art Bell&#39;s &#34;Coast to Coast&#34; radio program and should be made available when archive conversation, at that web site, is completed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Witness stated that during the entire event no sound was heard coming from the sphere nor was there any perceptible emission of any kind.  There was no disturbance to the immediate surroundings caused by the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Astronomical data for the date and time of sighting:  Moon: 18 degrees altitude; 84 degrees azimuth, 16% waning crescent  Jupiter: 23 degrees altitude; 241 degrees azimuth   +Data confirm the witness&#39;s statement regarding Jupiter&#39;s position in the sky.  The moon, while low in the sky, would have been behind the witness in the east.<n> <n><n> <n><n> *Calculated diameter of the object is made for when the object was first and last seen.  There is a difference of 12 feet between the two perspectives that probably reflect an uncertainty of the actual size rather than to suggest the object changed its size.<n> <n><n> <n><n> **Based on a total distance of 310 feet traveled by the UFO from initial sighting to when last observed, the calculated speed is 70mph if the time required was 3 seconds or 53mph if 4 seconds had elapsed.<n>

It was 4:00 am and I just stepped out the back door of the Bamberger building with a bag of trash and a cup of coffee. I put the trash in a trash can and stopped to drink some coffee. I was having problems with the batteries in my laser pointer that I  use for my work. I was pointing it towards jupiter in the western sky. I only had it on for about 1 to 2 minutes when in a blink of an eye a solid spherical object appeared over the Gore building about 150&#39; to 200&#39; feet off the ground. It startled me so I turned off the laser pointer and watched it for the time it set there, (about 2 to 3 sec.) it did not bob or weave, it sat as if it was locked in place. then in an instant it was moving about 60 mph across the top of the building in front of me then turning to move past me on my right, almost strait over my head, it looked like it was only 6o feet in the air as it passed over, the size wasabout 2&#39; feet wide at arms length ) it did not make a bit of sound at all or even make a breeze, I could see the bottom of the object and up the side, the top was black reflecting the night sky, a band around the lower middle reflecting the city lights and it had a reddish glowing tint on the bottom. the texture on the bottom was like it had small pits and pings, very much crater like. As it passed over I ran under it to see it out the other side of the tree cover, but before I could clear the trees I heard a bang sound, when I got into the clearing the object was gone. ( I am not sure if the sound was related to the object or not.)<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with this witness via telephone, and he sounded to be a credible witness.

It was traveling from south (buffalo) to north niagara falls at (quessing) 300 MPH. Military C-4 transports fly trainning exercises regularly from Niagara Falls AFB and I am using thier speed as reference. This object did not appear to be traveling at a high altitude, however, I have no physical reference short of the visual &#34;sharpness&#34; of the illuminated object. Specifically, this object looked like a bright &#34;pure white&#34; spherical light moving fast and completely silent. The light was abnormal, almost a pure well-defined white; I can&#39;t really describe it but it was not an incandecent light source. The object continued in a lenear path for approximately 1.5 sec and turned extreemely bright then vanished. Sound crazy, but it was like it energized to warp speed or something. My wife and I both witnessed this object and we haven&#39;t seen anything since.<n>

It also seemed to change shape ,as i was watching it move over head.I felt a most incredable rush,as i have been a believer in ufo&#39;s,though have never actually seen one,till now !!

The city lights were illuminating them enough to tell they are a light color,a dull silver or grey. I&#39;m not sure how high up they were but they were below cloud cover. I would guess the size of them at 15-20 feet in diameter. They made no sound. They were flying fast but I was still able to watch them for 15-20 seconds.I am 32 and have lived in Calgary my whole life, married with a 6 month old daughter and 3 yr old son.

I though it was a CHP car coming up from behind me because the flash was about the color of a police car light.  When I looked out my driver&#39;s side window, I saw a very bright blue-green light about 45 degrees above the eastern horizon.  It moved straight downward for about six seconds then appeared to burn out.  It didn&#39;t have a tail and it seemed to move slower than a shooting star or meteorite. It was about 1/4 to 1/3 the size of a full moon.  It was distinctive because of it&#39;s blue-green, almost bright cyan, color.<n>

Used a spotting scope. Lights pulsed in some pattern.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On Saturday September 12 1998 My wife and I were at my grandparents farm in Sheridan, Oregon. My wife first noted an interesting looking star, and upon looking at it I decided to get my spotting scope. When veiwed through the scope it became apparent that the object was not one light but rather a group of 7 independent lights.( at this time the lights were all blue and in a triangular pattern they later changed to 4 different colors  ) These light were pulsing at fast rate, and they appeared to be pulsing in some pattern. alternating in paterns of 2 colors at one time. O .    . O        O .             . O .   O  .  O  .  O The object then tilted on axis, and only the row of 4 lights were visable. At this time the lights changed from blue to yellow, green, red and blue. My wife noticed that the lights also appeared to change shape from round to rectangular and then back to round or oval. We witnessed a second object that had only two lights and these lights also cycled through the 4 colors of the first object. The object with the 4 lights was in a northeastern direction, and the 2nd object was in a northwestern direction respective to our position. Distance is hard to judge, but the objects moved away from each other. The second object moved below the tree line, and the object with four lights moved in a hook pattern to a higher point in the sky. We watched the first object for a period of 1.5 hours (from 20:30 to 22:00)and the second object was seen only for the first five minutes of the event. My mother also viewed these objects. I grew up in this area, and am familiar with the surroundings. I am a dental technician, and my wife is a self employed cosmotologist. My mother works for a major telecommunications company and has worked there for over 40 years.<n>

I say to him &#34;get it up, get it up, get it up&#34; becuase his angle of attack is nearly paralell to the ground to gain sufficient speed for take-off.  The wing-like aeroplan-apparition, white or silver in color then lifted at a very shallow angle and accelerated to an incredible speed directly northbound over I-5, I noticed that his wing-tips grew smaller and smaller, closer and closer together untill it was just a dot that disapeard within 5-6 seconds.  At first I thought it was a Cessna or Beech or duster on the field.  Cant say weather it took off north or south of 198, but is was no jet and thats for sure.

Object was in a flat horizontal projectory. More information can be found in depth at the URL above.<n> <n><n> <n><n> UFO Spotted on Mt. Baker, Washington (September 12, 1998) UFO Skywatchers from several parts of the United States gathered this year at Mt. Baker&#39;s &#34;Snowline Inn&#34;. The group was gathered for the yearly rendevous at this location where organizer, Tom Sanger, of Arizona, had his UFO experience in 1988. He and a buddy were hiking near the US-Canadian border when they were closely approached by a UFO. Oddly, the ridge closest to the UFO&#39;s position is called the Pleiades. Since then, Tom has gotten a group together every year for the outing to Mt. Baker. This object was clearly seen by ten people that were in our party and 4 others that were set up farther away with telescopes. It initially approached from west to east traveling approximately 7,000 miles per hour, according to retired Air Force personnel in our party. Far too fast to see through binoculars or telescopes. It was clearly visible for 5-10 seconds before it faded out. Interestingly, it was on a horizontal trajectory and not arching as a meteor would. The UFO had an orange corona as something traveling very fast in the atmosphere. It was the size of a pencil eraser at arms length. Distance was difficult to judge in the darkness, but it was between Mt. Baker, and Mt. Shuksin and at about 15 degrees. Last year, several residents of the area reported bright green lights over Goat Mt. and what appeared to be a large round circular area &#34;cut out&#34; of the snow. The area is only accessible by air or walking. There are no logging roads to get up there. The &#34;cut&#34; was on the northern slope where there are no residents on the other side to see it. Local deer hunters ran across it. Shortly after, black helicopters were seen in the area flying over the area of the missing snow. No mention was ever made to anyone in the area as to what this might have been. After we observed the UFO, the moon rose and shone brightly. We could clearly see a dense fog rolling into the area making it impossible to see any further. We opted to leave. In the 8 minutes it took to get everyone going, the fog was so thick you could hardly see the one in front of you. The road was twenty miles of winding hairpins. That combined with fog was more than we wanted to chance. We took off down the road slowly at first. We passed only one car coming up. Our driver, a lady from Arizona named Tina, was sharp eyed and spotted Owls in the trees alongside the road. She stopped and we shone the flashlight on them. They stayed put. We saw about four of them on the way off the mountain. Were they really owls? One might wonder.... The following morning at breakfast, we spoke to the driver of the car that was coming up the mountain. She said there was no fog when they got to the top. Amazing, since it was only 20 miles, and they were almost to the top when we passed them. This fact and that our driver could spot owls in the trees on a treacherous road at night in the fog was just totally amazing. If Tom has this next year, it&#39;s a must go for me! You can&#39;t spot them if you don&#39;t look for them! If you want to take part in it, email me and I&#39;ll put you on the list. Your mind is like a parachute. It only works when it is open!<n>

I went outside and what I saw was a white colored object moving west slowly. It seemed to be fairly high up-I don&#39;t know how high, but lower than what a commercial airliner flies at. This object was getting brighter and dimmer while moving west. There was no sound associated with it. It was going slow-not even as fast as a slow plane. There was a smoky looking circle of haze around this object, but as we have had forest fires around here maybe it was just leftover pollution, although the rest of the sky is clear today.The object moved west for about three to four minutes, then appeared to gain altitude and began going south. I watched it until it was very hard to see, then came inside. I thought, initially that maybe it was a helium balloon, but I have seen those in the sky before and this did not seem to be one. I have never seen helium balloons reflect sunlight like this object did. It definitely was NOT any aircraft that I have ever seen, and it was moving too slow to be a weather satellite. Last week, at about eleven thirty pm, my fiance and I saw a strange object in this area, and about fifteen minutes after we saw it there was a very fast moving jet that flew overhead(airforce?). If you would like more information on what we saw I would be happy to let you know. I am 29 years old, female, have nine years of law enforcement background, and am not a nut. My son is six years old. My fiance is 31 and a University Police Officer(and also not a nut case).<n>

Was reported before but did not get posted.  Was on another short vacation in Colorado in Buena Vista Colorado and stayed at the Rainbow Lake Resort located almost at the top of Cottonwood Pass.  While on a wind down walk with my mother-in-law, we both stopped to view the many stars in the sky that we otherwise could not see where we live in Texas.  While gazing at the stars we both noticed, at the same time, some movement within the milky way star groups.  What appeared to be a star that was stationary began to move and drop out of formation.  We figured it was a star burning out and shooting across space.  With further viewing with the binoculars we both noticed that it slowed down from going north and then started changing colors to blues, purples greens, orange in many revolutions of colors then it fired back into the star group within the milky way.  Strange to see this, we both thought, then the object zapped out of the group again and then with incredible speed zig zagged across the sky like no jet or object of flight the man can build. The directions were qucik and precise and at angles that no airplane we could design. I am ex-Air Force Special OPS and have never seen this display of exact super speed movement.  My mother in law proceeded to ask me what that was, and I advised that we may have just experienced a UFO.  The object continued to change direction back and forth at different angles and of course changing colors in its movement.  The colors seemed to increase in speed with the super fast speed of its directional changes.  Then the object became almost stationary but still showing very slight movement....moving northward.  Then the colors became intense and the objects colors started a revolving movement and it increased in speed faster than any jet I have known of...and proceeded north in the direction of Canada across the sky at very high speeds until it just disappeared. My mother-in-law to this date does not want to talk about what we saw that night.  She i! s a very Christian women and this defied her beliefs.  My understanding of this UFO is that it is not of our world, and if it is our government toy, we stole or enhanced the technology from another world to make this happen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date may be approximate.

It was flying very low and I could see obvious framework on the front end in a protruding triangular-like shape with an &#34;elbow&#34; on the side where I was viewing.  Similiar to placing a cigar into a large triangle and the bottom of the triangle being horizontal so it would be a stand if it were to land.  There were 3 large port- hole windows (that I could see) which illuminated bright white light.  There was no noise coming from it or any vapor trail.  It moved at a steady pace and kept going in a Northerly direction til out of site.  It really drew my attention not only because it was low but you never see any aircraft flying in that direction over my house because of the circling pattern of all of the aircraft waiting to land at Lambert Field.  Have also seen a bright green light falling to earth but it burned out right above my privacy fence so maybe SOME of the reports of the bright green glowing fireballs are just meteor showers even tho I must say I have never seen bright aqua-green meteors before.<n>

It was the year 1998 in San Angelo, Texas.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I went outside  because there was nothing to do inside. When I looked in the sky I saw a very big glowing red glowing fireball moving accross the sky with no sound. The moon was out too, it looked about a little smaller than the moon, it was big.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The fire ball had a really long tail connected trailing behing it. As the ball continued to move accross at a really slow pace,  about the same speed  and height as a plane moves accross the sky, this was no plane though it looked like a big comet or meteor.  I have never seen any thing like that before, and I&#39;ve seen a few comets and meteors.<n> <n><n> <n><n> AS the ball moved accross the sky, the tail stayed glowing red and stretched accross the sky as far as I could see.  I wanted to call my mom who was asleep at the time inside.  But I didnt want to wake her.It lasted about an hour, the tail stayed lit a little longer after the ball kept going out of sight.  The tail just faded away real slowly afterwards.  I could tell it looked like it wasn&#39;t falling down to Earth, it just kind of looked like it kept going around the world.  I looked for some pictures on the net of what it looked like but found nothing.  IT looked like a comet but alot bigger and closer.  Pluse it was red and glowing, not blue.  I thought it might have been a spaceshuttle taking off but now I have seen how they take off, strait up in the air not accross the sky.  To this day I dont know what it was.  I have never seen it again I dont think it was an alien thing or nothing like that, just a UFO.  This is the truth, if anyone else has seen anything the same please say something.  I&#39;m just trying to figure out what it was. This was in south side San Angelo around 1997 and 1998.  I was in an urban area so someone else had to have seen it.<n>

Appropriately enough, we were out at the Oceanside Municipal Airport and there were about 20 or so adults, including a couple of elected city councilmembers, standing around chatting, getting ready to leave the venue when I spotted what I thought at first was a cheap skyrocket. I thought this because of the sparks and firey trail coming out from behind. The object was moving at a high rate of speed, but maintaining a level flight in a direct westerly to east path. I had enough time to realize that this was not a meteor or a skyrocket and something unusual. I shouted to everyone, pointing up to the sky. Everyone was able to watch this object travel east into a bank of light clouds. It didn&#39;t look that high, but the next day I read in the San Diego Union that the same object had been observed by people as far away as north of Los Angeles. What makes me write this report nearly three weeks after the fact was hearing Peter on Art Bell&#39;s program tonight (09/24/98). At approximately 10:15 p.m., Peter played a tape recording of a woman reporting this exact same object that she saw as she traveled on State Highway 18 toward Lake Arrowhead in the San Bernardino Mountains. She claimed it flew directly over her...she said it was at 7:15 p.m. This definitely was not a meteor, as most so-called officials have explained. I am a 30-year veteran of journalism, a daily columnist for the North County Times, (circulation 96,000), which covers northern San Diego County. This makes the second time I have observed a UFO in the presence of community leaders. I&#39;ve written about it both times and have received phone calls from readers acknowledging what I saw.<n>

Turning to the North I was amazed to see the brightest object in a night sky I can remember. The round object was moving very slow, and it was so bright it was lighting the air around it giving it the appearance of a halo. As it decended the halo disappeared and the ball faded out in a linear fashion, keeping its original size as it darkened. I told my wife about it and when I heard the other reports coming in last night 9-23-98 it reminded me of my experience and I thought it might be interesting to others. My background is degree in physics, retired from semiconductor industry and 43 years as a ham radio operator - K5BTV.<n>

The glow from tip to tip was of even intensity - no core that was sharper  or brighter.  It was not a meteor, - it traveled even faster than what I have perceived meteors to travel.

I went out to get some air and look at the stars.  I looked up at the dig dipper then looked to the south.  I thought the 10:30p.m. flight was comming in a few nimutes early.  I noticed that the plane had on what seemed to be landing lights.  I also noticed that it seemed to be comming in pretty darn fast.  It did not slow down when it should have nor did it desend as it got closer.  The object was not following the normal routeen.  It Passed almost directly overhead so I was able to get a very good look at it.  As it approached I could see it was not shaped like the 737 that normally came in at 10:30 p.m.  The wingletts at the located at the tip of eash wing looked to be about 20 feet tall and had 4 virtical lights or windows on each side of the winglett.  These lights or windows looked simular to a two tube, four foot, floresnt light. There was a row of these lights or windows on the under side of the leading edge of the flying wedge.  I tried to call the control tower to ask if they had seem it.  They would not take any calls, the next day I went over to the control tower to ask if they had any notification of the craft and was told NO!  I have not talked to anyone else who say it.  The craft was about 500 to a 1000 feet of the deck it made absolutely NO sound as it spead up to the north. I watched it from horizen to horizen and it only took about 2 minutes do disapera into the northern sky.<n>

Light stopped and hovered for 1 1/2 hours and was observed by my son and I.  Light was a bright white and then would emanate bright flashes of red, blue and green.  Light did not change its position in the sky at the same  pace the stars did and clearly appeared much closer than any star.  At one point, a bright red light shot off to the north and downward to the horizon from the light.  About 40 minutes later, another red light shot out to the south from the object at an incredible rate of speed.  The main light appeared to shift position to regain a position relative to a star we were measuring against.  The sky was perfectly clear.  We were in the woods with no background lighting other than a full moon.  Comparing the position of the light to a map, the light may have been in proximity to McChord AFB. No other aircraft ever flew in proximity for the 1 1/2 hours we watched.<n>

The observation was brief as it was moving at a high rate of speed from the West to the East. I&#39;m currently a police officer for a local city police department in St. Clair County, Michigan. I have been a police officer since 1991 and have witnessed one other strange observation way back on 1984 in Livonia Michigan which was also witnessed by two other subjects. The incident was reported in our local newspaper (Livonia Observer and the Detroit News). I can supply dates and times if you are interested. I became a member of Mufon several months ago and I&#39;m aware of several of the reports out there about &#34;Green Fireballs&#34;. I also listen to Art Bell and have heard Peter Davenport on the radio concerning these incidents. I decided to finally send you this report after hearing other people report similar  observations.<n>

They went up in steps and each one was a bit smaller than the one beneath it. It was white. Rectangular windows went all the way around it. On the bottom was four &#39;legs&#39;. These were silver poles with flat disks on the end. On the top were lots of antennae and aerials. Some of these were flashing. The windows also flashed. I heard a sort of beeping noise and a whirring noise. The thing was flying upwards on a sharp diagonal and it went behind a large cloud. I was scared so I ran into my house. It was flying fairly quickly and was quite large.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

We were using our binoculars and night vision and were looking at the stars in the night sky. A large light slightly brighter than a large star which had been sitting motionless for a half hour suddenly, started moving from N.E. to S.E. at approx. 45 degrees above the horizon We had been watching planes fly slowly by during the evening and knew immidiatly it was a UFO.  We have seen ufos many times before so are familar with their flight pattern. From a stopped position it speed up three or four times faster than the planes or jets that we could see in the distance.It varied its speed slowing down and speeding back up for about ten seconds than James who had been looking at the ufo with his binoculars took them down for a quick readjustment.  I looked at my night vision scope in preparation to looking through it.  This took about one second for both of us to make these adjustments when we both looked back to our amazement it was completely gone from the center of the sky a distance that would have taken a plane about ten minutes to travel. We both realized even more deeply how prevalant and a part of the universe UFOs really are.<n>
9/4/98 22:03|Hartsdale/White Plains|NY|Triangle|5-7 minutes|Observed at altitude of approximately 300 feet based on ceiling (5000) and aircraft approaching local airport (White Plains Airport).|10/2/99|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/009/S09748.html|222|ndxe199809| Observed at altitude of approximately 300 feet based on ceiling (5000) and aircraft approaching local airport (White Plains Airport).  Object was estimated at at least 1000 feet.  Three white lights at each apex, a blue/white (vgery bright) strobe amidship and a red strobe (also bright) at trailing edge.  Size was based on approximate altitude of 3000 feet.  Traveling (estimated) at 50 mph or less, no noise whatsoever.  Object was leading with flat edge, not an apex.  Color was dull aluminum and appeared to be contiguously lit as if it had a light f it&#39;s own.  No other lights were in view.  Direction (corrected from original report) was North by North East.  Reported to Michael Lindemann and Jeff Rense and posted to Jeff&#39;s site as well as Michael&#39;s CNI News.  Also sent rough drawing to Michael, FYI.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I heard a dull rumbling sound during most of the day, and was listening to the beginning of the Jeff Rense Show.  I was interested in hearing the guest that evening (I believe it was John Velez).  I never made it.  I heard a dull rumbling sound again, went out to my terrace and at first saw nothing.  In a moment, I saw (with no sound at all) what appeared to be a huge object described above.  I was shaking with excitement, as I had never seen anything this large.  I knew the ceiling was low because of the cloud cover, I knew the size was huge, not only by virtue of the obvious appearance of great size, but that aircraft were making landing approach to White Plains airport and appeared miniscule by comparison.  Also, they were flying well under this UFO. I went inside to get a pair of binocs, one of which was hanging from my 4 inch reflector.  The binocs are 20X.  I saw the object at greater amplification, but no further detail. I called out to my wife to come out and see this, (onto my terrace) but she did not hear me.  She was in the shower.  I reported my sighting to a chuckling tower person at White Plains, FAA on Long Island and to MUFON.  I never filled out a report to MUFON, as I was not at all impressed with the caliber of individual who was sent out to interview me.  This also, I recently reported to MUFON.  I have since dropped my membership.  But that&#39;s another story. To my knowledge, no others in my condo complex were out that evening, although if no one heard me screaming to my wife to come out, I&#39;ll eat my hat.<n>

I then saw that the object had two lights. I retreived my binoculars. The two lights were at the ends of a cylinder. I watched the object until my view was obstructed by trees.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At 20:45 (PST) on 04-September-1998 I observed an object in the sky travelling in a northwestern direction. At first I believed the object was a satellite. As I watched the object I noticed that it had two lights and not one. I quickly obtained my binoculars so that I could observe the object more clearly. Upon doing so, I noticed that the two lights were at the ends of a cylinder-shaped object. It was difficult to make any other details of the craft out as the magnification of my binoculars are not that high. The lights on the object were about the color of a star and did not blink as you would find with aviation lights. I observed the object flying in a straight line with no sound. the object appeared to be travelling at a slow pace then seemed to gain in speed. I watched the object until my view was obstructed by trees in the area. It is difficult to say what color the cylinder was, it appeared almost transparent, yet it appeared solid. This is not the first time I have had a sighting in this area, to date this is my fourth.<n>

As we drove West on Southern State Pkwy., just past Exit 22 (Meadowbrook Pkwy.), a blue-green sphere shaped object zoomed very fast across the sky from East to West. We did not have the radio on and the windows were open. There was no sound from the object. After arriving home about 20 minutes later, we noticed the clouds looked like they were cut in half with a knife and we saw a huge white streak of mist and/or exhaust going in the same direction as the object flew.  the moon became very visible and we saw some stars. 5 minutes later approx 12:05am, we heard heliocopters in the distance. As the white streak dissapated, the haze and clouds covered the sky again, the stars were no longer visable and the moon was back in the haze again.<n>

And then within a few seconds it sped of at an incredible speed and disappeared. This is very similar to what I had seen a couple years previous. Also the next night Me and a friend of mine returning from byron,mn to rochester saw something green break up very close to the ground. believe it was a meteor or space junk?<n>

These five points of light were moving with-in paramenters they set for themselves. They were changing the&#39;yre positions to different points...very quickly. So fluenlty infact,,they&#39;re movement looked like they were acting as one, trying to create 3D looking shapes. They would buzz around like flies within a cluster...then STOP..FROZEN, but in another perfect looking 3D shape.(as if you could connect the dots, with your eye&#39;s).. The shapes had depth. Thats what convinced me they were trying to make us see...shapes....simple 3D shapes...these lights had pilot&#39;s inside....they had supreme intellingence and total understanding of they&#39;re whereabouts in space, and they&#39;re positions apart from each other within the cluster. They were performing arial stunts..like birds mating...UNBELIEVABLE!! To describe how far away they were......If you look into a clear night sky...you can always see what looks to be sattelites whizing across the sky....they only go in one direction..either left to right or right to left...these lights were the same distance away from me...they were far away...but very close at the same time, almost too close....... I watched them as if I was watching kids play in a playground...It looked a a science fiction movie, or a java-applet..on your computer....I didn&#39;t want them to go..they did....they just moved on...peacefully. With-out a doubt..in my mind......I am 110 percent positive..this was nothing made from human technology. I&#39;m a smart person...I have perfect eye sight.....I would laugh in anybody&#39;s face, that told me I was seeing an illusion. Maybe if we all just took a moment out of our busy lives, and looked into the skies...maybe we would all learn something or two!<n>

You could say it was probably a dream but it&#39;s not. I was lying bed and I felt someone or something lift me up.  I was taken into this room that contained this bright light as soon as you walked in.  I was tied up onto a chair, like an electric chair.  They took pictures of me and they opened up my wrists.  The stuck a computer chip- like thing onto inside my left wrist.  Which I hink has moved up to my inner elbow area.  Then they shined a laser ray gun thing on my wrist and the opening disappered, and I stopped bleeding.  The creatures doing this to me, seemed human.  Except for one thing, they all had a big eye on the back of their heads.  They all looked like men in doctor coats, except the coats weren&#39;t white, they were black.  Then they gave me a drink that made me fall asleep.  When I awoke I was on the FLOOR of my bedroom, with out a scratch, other than itchiness on my left arm.<n> <n><n> <n><n> that&#39;s all<n>

White luminous disk traverses 70% of the northern horizon from east to west in 1 to 2 seconds parallel to horizon.  It was too high to be a plane over the Portland Airport yet quit low and too parallel to the horizon to be a shooting star.  Within 10 seconds another (more faint) object was seen traveling at a high rate of speed (yet much slower) in a northerly direction over (what I would call) the coastline of Oregon.  This was too fast to be a plane but much slower than the east-west object.  Yet both objects had a similar destination west of the coastline of the Northwest U.S. and disappeared.<n>

This lasted for approx. 30 min. until they flew from view behind the trees to the west. There were no tailights as you see on airplanes which we view all the time as we are on two flightpaths, one for Toronto Pearson International airport and one for Mount Hope airport in Hamilton.

Not being much of gamblers, we went up on the top deck. After about one hour of standing on deck, my wife quietly said, in utter shock, to &#34;look begind you&#34;. I turned around and there were 3 triangular shaped UFO&#39;s in formation, approximately 500 ft. away. 2 were on the bottom, one hovering above these, forming one huge triangle.(Overall size of each object was approximately 50x50x50 ft.) They each had red lights that remained constant, around the perimeter of each triangle. They also were sloped backward in position, approx. 10 degrees. As we stared in disbelief, they made no movement OR sound. After about 3-5 mins., they all traveled back and away in unison, again no sound. All these years we have felt that our military has some real advanced technology, OR maybe they don&#39;t. Having been priviledged to witness such an event, we have only recently heard through media of similar objects like these. Not knowing anybodies reaction to our story, we kind of chuckle to each other that we have been fortunate to have seen and believe.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.

Two very different formations. On the second sighting saw about 5 military jets that flew extremely close to I-10 vehicles.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were taveling westbound on I-10 on September 1, 1998, approximately 8:30pm, between Desert Center and Indio, California.  The first sighting was about 10-15 miles west of Ironwood Prison on the south side of the road.  We saw four huge, round orbs of very bright, intense yellow-amber light.  One orb was higher than the other three, which were all level just below the mountin tops.  They were all very close, about 1-2 miles from the road.  We watched at length as we traveled.  The orb of light on the left, although the same size as the other three, clearly was hovering much higher above the mountain range. The others were all in one level line, seemingly intentionally just below the crest of the mountain range.  Suddenly the higher orb simply vanished.  It did not fly away.  It did not leave a trail (the moon was very bright and made it possible to see the outline of items in the area.)  It vanished so quickly and suddenly, followed almost immediately by two of the other three, and then the third, in the btween the remaing three.  Although we could see the entire surroundings, including trees, poles, and mountain outlines, we saw no evidence of the four orbs once they were gone.  About 10-15 miles further west, just past that mountain range, they suddenly appeared again.  This time much brighter, closer and larger, about 1 mile away from us.  The formation was now more like a &#34;v&#34;, with the left appearing higher, the second from left even with the fourth, which was on the right, and the third from left at the base of the &#34;V&#34;.  THe groun was illuminated completely by the light from the objects.  At that time we spotted the first two of what we believe were five military jets.  One jet came so very, very close above the traffic that it startled us.  We watched the orbs and the jets for another five minutes, and then needed to continue toward our destination. We did not see them disappear, and we could still see the glow long after our view was obscured by the mountains, but traffic obviously was slowing g! reatly behind us, perhaps to watch.<n>

I had just turned west on I-70 at Crecent Junction, Utah and had traveled just a few miles past the town of Thomson Utah when I glanced over to my left and saw way off on the horizon a straight line formation of five different colored flashing lights. I was with my partner and I exclaimed that I thought that there were five helecopters hovering out there with different colored strobe lights attached to them. As he continued to stare at them he told me to pull over because something was strange. He noticed that the lights were flashing in sequence from left to right and were very stationary in the sky. I said that they must be radio towers and he said that radio towers have lights all the way up the tower not just one light at the top. Then we noticed that the lights weren&#39;t really the type of light that we were accustomed to seeing. They had a funny little glow that didn&#39;t quite look normal. Then we realized that they were in the same color sequence as a rainbow, from infra red to ultra violet and in five different colors.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I decided to turn on my amber yellow strobe for some unknown reason and when I did that the flashing sequence started to speed up. They started flashing in sequence from left to right very fast and they started to grow together very quickly which means this thing started to speed off in the opposite directing very vast. It&#39;s really hard to judge distance or size the way they sat out on the dark horizon but I would guess the formation to be about two hundred feet between the unfra red light and the ultra violet light, but I really don&#39;t know for sure. There was no sound that we could hear. We couldn&#39;t see any other shape attached to the lights. We saw only the five lights. My partner looked over at me after it disappeared an asked me &#34;How long do you think we sat and watched those lights?&#34; I replied, &#34;About five minutes.&#34; I retired right after that so I haven&#39;t seen him since then but I&#39;m sure I can find him and he will have no problem cooberating my story.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is the second report that I&#39;m sending and I&#39;ve now reported all of the ufos that I&#39;ve seen in my lifetime.<n>

The reason I especially noticed it was that it did not stay far away as a star would. It seemed to be staying in the same place all the time, so as I drove down the motorway and approached it I literally drove underneath whatever it was.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This places the U.F.O.s to the west of the county and within just a few miles of the outskirts of London.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I looked up through the car windscreen I saw that the craft was very dark grey/black, triangular shaped, with lights at each corner. I could see that the underside of the object was divided into sections. I wondered if it could have been a Harrier or the &#34;invisible&#34; Stealth bomber or something but I didn&#39;t see any wheels hanging down, just the white lights at each corner of the triangle. When I have mentioned this to other people over the years they always ask if there were other vehicles on the motorway but I just cannot remember now - I was far more interested in what was directly above me!  It seemed to be hovering and there was absolutely no noise whatsoever. When I told my husband later about this he asked about the noise level. Ovbviously a normal aircraft would have been extremely noisy, especially as it seemed so close to the ground to me, but I definitely did not hear anything.  I got the impression that it was hovering.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I see from your reports that other people have seen similar things far more recently which is why I decided to report my own sighting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))<n>
9/1/98 19:30|Avoca|PA|Triangle|approx 2 min|Driving South on I-81 around 20 miles South of Avoca Airport. Saw large object hovering right off the side of highway.  Nighttime spott|4/1/00|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/012/S12470.html|242|ndxe199809| Driving South on I-81 around 20 miles South of Avoca Airport. Saw large object hovering right off the side of highway.  Nighttime spotting so shape hard to make out.  3 very bright white lights on front, tiny rapidly blinking red light on side facing us.  I am only guessing the shape to be triangle since night sky and bright lights made it difficult to discern<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am hoping to find someone else who has seen what my fiance and myself witnessed at around 8:30 pm on Interstate 81 in PA near Wilkes Barre. We were driving home one evening after spending the day at the Italian festival in Scranton PA. We were on Interstate 81 South near the Scranton/Wilkes Barre International airport in Avoca when we first saw this object. We took notice of this thing because it was extremely high in the sky with 3 huge very bright white lights but with no of the typical blinking lights which are common to known aircraft. We paid little attention to it seeing that we were so close to the airport and chances were that it was some kind of commercial aircraft. We wound our way past the airport on 81 south and continued for another 20 miles or so before we came around a bend in the highway and out of a small patch of trees which are common on this highway when we saw it again. It now was no more than 150 feet off the ground with its 3 bright white lights now hitting us in the face, nearly blinding us. other cars on the road around us began swerving as we did due to the sudden loss of visibility. My fiance began saying things like &#34;What is that? Is that a plane?&#34; I at first thought we were about to witness a horrible plane crash but the thing never crashed. It did not even move all that much! As we got closer to it, I wondered why this thing didn&#39;t shoot over us to the north toward the airport if it were indeed a jet coming in for a landing at the airport. As a matter of fact, the craft was not moving horozontally at all. It was making a slow vertical descent over what I could only describe as a small industrial park. I had a good vantage point to judge how high (or low) the craft was in the sky since it was near a radio tower. This huge craft was definitely lower than the top of this nearby radio tower. I quickly opened the sunroof on the car and stuck my head outside the top of the car. the only thing I could hear was the traffic of the other cars and trucks on the highway and the wind! rushing around my head. This craft made no noticeable sound. Later that night I thought that perhaps what we saw was a large helecopter or a harrier jet of some kind. these are the two craft that to my knowledge can hover without horozontal movement. If this thing were a helecopter, it would have had to have been one of those big old Chinooks who&#39;s rotors make enough noise to shake the very ground if it were to be at the low altitude that this monster was at. This thing was RIGHT off the side of the highway so a chinook would have been easily heard from our vantage point. I invesitgated the possibility of a harrier jet. I learned that harrier jets were not only way too small to be this craft, but also make a terrible noise when using its engines to hover as this craft was doing. As we passed along the craft&#39;s right side, I tried my best to discern a shape of some sort. I could not see any wings at all on this thing to speak of, but I was able to barely make out a very small red light on its right hand side blinking in a very rapid fashion. This red light was very small an was toward the rear of the craft. The shape I could not define to an absolute seeing that it was against the night sky but my eyes saw that the craft was very angular and rectangular from the profile view I had of it. I kick myself every day for not making my fiance turn the car around to get a second look at it. Again, this crat was BIG. The size of a large commercial jet at least. Yet, what kind of commercial jet has the ability to hover? It di not pass us on the highway...we passed IT! It did not move save in a slow smooth downward motion. Again, this was Early September 1998 along interstate 81 near Wilkes Barre, PA at approximately 8:30 pm. i never have reported this to any authority due mostly to the fact I did not know who to contact in this kind of a case. I am not the only one who saw this thing on that particular night as the highway was full of cars and trucks. A friend of mine who used to drive from our college in Columbia county i! n North Central PA to his home in upstate NY told me in confidence even before I saw this craft that he had seen something that matched my description to a tee pace his car and a tractor trailer while he drove home one night on 81 northbound. The craft in his description flew over very quickly and then suddenly slowed and flew over his car and the truck for around 1 mile before veering suddenly and disappearing to the West. The trucker and my friend honked at each other after the craft flew over almost to ask each other if the other saw what they saw. He described the craft as &#34;very large with 3 bright white lights.&#34; I hope someone someday will read this and respond either by follow-up post or direct email reply and tell me what the hell that thing was. A little info about myself. I am now a 23 year old white male. Computer Technician. While I held an interest in UFO&#39;s and the like, I never gave them much credit until this incident. I have visited other UFO sites in the hopes of finding someone else who has had an experience along I-81 in PA, with no luck. At the time of the sighting, i was a 21 year old college student at a state college in PA.<n>

There were two levels of clouds. The lower clouds were wispy, about 8,000 feet I&#39;m told.   I took a break and looked East.   I was looking at approximately a 45 degree angle thinking how nice the day was and observed a dirty copper colored round disc appear.  The disc appeared to be travelling Southbound. I observed the disc appear to bank to it&#39;s left as I could see the bottom of the disc, and it&#39;s shape - round.  The best I can describe is hang an object from a string. Push it away, and as it swings back you&#39;ll see the bottom for about that long in time.   This object was huge.  It then disappeared as fast as it appeared.  I never saw it until it started to bank, and it disappeared after banking.   It was unbelievable at the time. It was above the lower cloud level. Using basic geometry, if the clouds are about 8,000 feet and I&#39;m looking at an approximate 45 degree angle then A squared plus B squared equals c squared.   ( right triangle )  My best guess is it was 2 1/2 miles away.  I have travelled to the country and gotten about 2 1/2 miles from barns to estimate the size of this object.   My best guess is this was approximately 100 feet in size. It was far larger then the moon when full, and a half dollar held at arms length. I work in Law enforcement. Have for ten years.   I &#39;ve been within  400 feet of unknown objects, twice 25 years ago on separate occasions at night.   I&#39;m not crazy.   I know something exists.  I have thought a year about writing to you. I also have dated a person who states her brother works in the military and they monitor all UFO sites on the Internet, and he told her to stay away from them.   Whether you get this remains to be seen. You may email me should you choose to do so.  Thanks<n>

However, there was sound eminating just quiet as they passed overhead.   20  minutes later a second object  went past in the same direction from a diffferent angle.   A tear of joy ran down my cheek for being selected to see them, In my mind and heart  I projected Love and Light towards them.   My awareness is growing....... Look towards the sky…<n>
