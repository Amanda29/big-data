I was looking up into the sky and observed, at first, what I thought might be a flare or a rocket. But the object was travelling upwards. I got my video camera to tape the object. The object changed from a bright white to a very red color. I zoomed in and out to get some reference as to the relative location of the object. It travelled upward and then seemed to hoover. I taped it moving around in a small area bounded by some stars or planets. There was no noise or any other phenomena associted with the event. I was certain that the object was some type of UFO. The video tape is not as clear as what I witnessed, but the object and stars are visible. I tried to make a copy of the video, but the copy quality was not good. I still have the original video tape and would make it available for reproduction.<n>
12/24/89 23:45|Orrington|ME|Triangle|15 minutes|Large dark triangular object with two round lights on either end and smaller circular lights in the middle|1/10/09|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/066/S66755.html|3|ndxe198912| Large dark triangular object with two round lights on either end and smaller circular lights in the middle<n> <n><n> <n><n> Playing cards late one night I kept noticing a bright light over the island several hundred feet in front of our lakehouse. This was not unusual because plans often came across the lake as one of the flight paths to the Bangor Airport. What was unusual was the light stayed the same with out changing and there was no noise. Both, my husband and I kept saying &#34;that&#39;s weird&#34;, but were convinced it was a plane. After some time we knew this was not right and went out side to see what it was and to our amazement we could distinquish in the night sky, a large triangular shaped object hoovering slightly above the trees of this 3 acre Island. Had the object been more directly over the Island, it would not have been much smaller  in diameter; the air seemed muffled, but there was no sound. Two large round lights which looked like the burners of a gas stove(bluish) were on two ends and under the object, in a circular form were smaller lights (greenish- if I recall). It must have been at leat 200 feet long (at least) My kids would swim to island, but it was about 1/4 mile in front of our house. There was no noise! My husband started to walk closer to the shoreline, to get closer, but I was scared. When he did that it seemed to start to move slowly toward us, and I ran to the house. When I stopped and looked back it sat still for a moment or two, and that just bolted off (still no noise). We called the airport the next day to see if the stealth had been in, but we got no where for information. I have written on-line,somewhere, but never heard anything. No, we were not drinking, do not have psychological issues, or obsessed about this issue. Just very weird, and after this event I would wake up screaming on many occassions, which I had never done before..yet, I had no idea why. And, nearly six  months after the event both my husband and I were slammed out of bed (in the middle of the night) by nothing we could see. We sat up most of that night trying to figure out what was wrong with us, or the house.! . Maybe it had something to do with the object, maybe not...? WE sold the house, and the doctor that purchased it has told me he&#39;s been happy and not mentioned anything &#34;unusual&#34;, and (of course) I was not about to say anything.  Maybe it was really the stealth, and maybe I just had some night screams for normal reasons (I don&#39;t know what, but perhaps it happens), But, there truely is no explanation for the violent forced blow sending both, my husband and I, out of the bed and on to the floor...<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.

I watched it for awhile before actually getting my video recorder.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The light went straight up in appearance and seemed to be a rocket.  It lasted a seemingly long time.  Then it hovered and moved relative to a planet or star.  It stayed that way for a long time, just moving slowly and eventually fading out but still moving.  It was the middle of the night, summer and hot.  The air was calm.  I looked out to the west and nearly straight up as that is the only direction the light travelled.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I recorded 3 minutes of the light as it moved relative to a planet or start.

The object hoovered over the trees behind the graveyard. We all just sat there and looked at it until it went away, then left. My parents have always been reluctant to talk about it because of course, people woundnt believe it.

I was only 10 years old at the time. I am 22 now, and have waied a long time to share my story.<n> <n><n> <n><n> One darkish Winter morning, my mother and my father were walking my sister and I to school. Our school was fairly close to our old apartment building in Chicago on the Westside.<n> <n><n> <n><n> To get to our school, you have to walk across a huge empty field. This field was covered with snow.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Anyway, we were coming across the field,  a few other people were ahead of us. Then it happened.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was a SUPER loud crashing sound. Louder than anything I&#39;ve ever heard. Later, I found out that this noise was heard all across Chicago, and some close cities. So you know it was LOUD! Then I saw a white round object that looked hard, hovering over the field. About as high as your average house. It was low enough to scare everybody on the field.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was a bright strip of light, coming from one side of the Saucer. There was a crazy beeping sound, and everybody on the field hit the ground. We covered our heads in the cold snow. We were scared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When we got back up, the object was gone, and the sky had gone back to being dark.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Everybody was shaken up. Laughing about what we had just seen. We didn&#39;t know what to do, this was 1989.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was only 1 white spaceship. It never landed. But I believe that it was trying to land on our snow-covered field. But when they saw humans, they scared us, and left.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am now 22. I&#39;m black. I&#39;m in college. My father is now dead of a heart attack, he would be 44 in October. My mother is 44. She works at a hospital. She&#39;s the sweetest lady. My sister is 26. She graduated with a degree in pschology from a 4-year university.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  We will request other reports from the other witnesses.

I went out on the porch and observed a white light which looked like a star. It was hard to judge it&#39;s distance but it exploded every 3-4 seconds and dimmed.I was looking east towards Santa Clara along Evelyn Ave.This same phenomena also happened on Feb. 7th 1991. This time at 22:30 (approx.) After 15-20 minutes a C-141 came from the north and flew around the area. I talked to a 7-11 cashier closer to the event who jumped under the counter he was so scared, this was several days later. Probably police reports filed on this one.<n>
12/15/89 18:00|Glennwood|OR|Sphere|1 Minute|A brightly lit perfectly round sphere floated in front of the car at a traffic signal.|6/12/07|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/056/S56511.html|10|ndxe198912| A brightly lit perfectly round sphere floated in front of the car at a traffic signal.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A &#34;family member&#34; and myself were waiting at a traffic light on Franklin Blvd. in a small burb between the cities of Eugene and Springfield.  We just picked up a pizza to take home on one of these foggy evenings at this time of year.  The fog was just starting to condense and lower towards the ground as it was visible by the city lights. It was already dark and you could see the moon rising to our left. I was a passenger in the car and noted to my co-occupant that the moon was rising. And then I saw another more bright, round sphere-shaped object coming from the left side of the vehicle. It appeared at first to be the same size as the moon. But it moved steadily and became brighter as it crossed our plane of view from left to right,(East to West). The object was a bright white lighted sphere, a completely round ball. It&#39;s size seemed to be approx. 15-20 feet in diameter. As it moved I got the attention of the person with me and alerted him to it. That is when I noticed that he was in a state of mild shock, for he would never believe in anything like UFO&#39;s, ghosts or any thing out of the ordinary. I quickly focused my eyes on this thing in disbelief myself. It floated slowly in front of us about roughly 1000 ft. away and about 150 feet off the ground. It appeared to be manuevering around trees and it would rise up into the lowering fog layer creating a glow in the fog. It would then drop back down towards the ground. At one point it came close in and I could clearly see that it was a three dimensional object for it had a shadow feature on the bottom and was more bright in the middle and less towards the edges. I got really excited and told my &#34;family member&#34; that we should follow it because it moved slow enough to be pursued. It eventually disappeared behind a hill and then my fellow occupant suddenly grabed me by the neck and very forcefully said in no uncertain terms,&#34;Don&#39;t tell anyone we saw this thing!&#34; And then he just non-chalantly turned the car out onto the main road and drove off a! s if not hing ever happened. I was shocked by his reaction to witnessing this together. For I thought; aha...now lets hear him deny that there are things in this universe that cannot be explained! To this day he claims to have no recollection that we ever saw this thing together. He is either under some kind of spell or in deep denial. It was several months later that my memory of this experience hit me like a sledge hammer and It took me a while to realize It was not some kind of strange day dream. Part of my curiosity about him having such an agressive reaction to something from out of this world is that he is a very close personal friend to an influential congressman and a prominent businessman in the community. His fear would be based on their reputations in the community. So, I remained silent for many years. One strange thing did happen one evening over a card game with some friends and we got on the subject of UFO&#39;s and the like and I told my friends about this experience and Brian suddenly had this wierd look and he recollected a story from a close friend back in Indiana when he was in high school. His friend told him about seeing this exact same thing from a car parked on the side of a country road and it had landed in a recently mowed hay field. They apparently had a good look at it and were able to size it up based on these rolled up balls(bales) of hay. It was three times the size of one of the hay bales, and Brian&#39;s friends brother got out of the car and walked up to it and actually touched it! Later they found themselved in the car together and it was near morning. They claimed to have lost some time. When Brian&#39;s friend came to, his brother grabbed him by the neck and said those exact same words that my &#34;family member&#34; said to me in 1998! &#34;Don&#39;t tell anyone we saw this thing!&#34; Now this really blew me out of the water, because I had always wondered if I was simply loosing touch with reality over this experience. My friend Brian is a musician and business man as well and I have never heard him talk o! r discus s anything outside of this realm of existence. Strange, what is this thing? A probe? A time travel device? There was no sound or other lights around or near the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

Black metallic rectangular shaped. It was close, hovered, and soundless.  We were speechless.  In addition, my car actually died and did not start until the craft was out of site.  When it moved, it rotated.  I was thankful my friend saw it with me or else I would have questioned my sanity.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Before I saw it, I did not believe in the possibility and was strongly against the existance of such things. However, ever since, I am very interested in the possibility of UFOs and possibility of other intelligent life forms.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am glad that I saw this.  Even though many didn&#39;t believe us, we KNOW what we saw and experienced. I will never forget and could draw a picture of it even now...almost 30 years later.<n>

I was walking across the street towards Papillon Helicopters.  Noone was flying at the time and the town was pretty deserted as it is every winter. The sun was going down, but there was still plenty of light out. I looked east out over the helipads and saw a saucer like shaped ship hovering over the tree line. I looked up and down the street to see if anyone could see this and noone was around. The ship sailed towards me without a sound.  There were a lot of different colored lights around the middle of it that seemed to be slowly spinning or pulsing around the craft. It appeared to be flying about 50 to 75 feet off the ground and was bigger than a large helicopter. The ship hovered over the helicopters for what seemed like three or four minutes and then slowly ascended up and back over the tree line. It was totally silent and I didn&#39;t feel any fear, it was just hard for me to accept that what I saw was real.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

I immediately called my wife when I got to work after I first saw it, but I never told anyone else until now. Because of this incident I never have to wonder anymore of the existance of U.F.O.&#39;s.

It was a clear and very cold night with a dead calm wind and no moon so it was very dark. Suddenly I felt a breeze come up at approximately 5 mph. As a Space &amp; Atmospheric Weather Forecaster I instinctively looked up and much to my surprise saw a diamond shaped object at a zenith of approximately 70 deg. The object was completely light up all along the edges with a dull very dark red or burgundy color. It made absolutely no noise and was moving northward at a slow rate of speed. I sized it up by stretching my right arm upward and at that distance comparing it to my finger length. It was as long as my middle finger. I watched it for approximately 5 minutes until it disappeared across the northern horizon.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

This made no sense though, since AB is way south and west of this location.  AB does not base the B-2.  They were later deployed to Whiteman AFB.  I have seen and heard the B-2 since then, and can tell you that what I saw was not that.  I would estimate size as roughly front to back 50 ft side to side 150 ft.

Out of nowhere there appears a huge triangle of lights. Only three lights but super bright. But I could still look at the lights without squinting my eyes.  There wasn&#39;t any noise at all from the object. I noticed all the horses stopped moving and the ducks stopped making noise as well. It just hovered over the pond. Its lights lit up the pond and the area around it.  I couldn&#39;t take my eyes off of it. Then it just zipped out of sight, like someone turned off the light switch.  Gone and still no noise.  I looked over to the other gate and ask the other person if she saw that and she said yes. We never! mentioned to each other again.

My father did not know how to get back on the highway, so he was going to wave the other car down and have them tell us directions. My father came to a stop and waited for the other car to pull up. Except it stopped about 25 feet infront of us. That is when we notice that the head lights seemed to be floating in the sky. After a few seconds my father pulled a little further up, and the lights raised about 15 feet in the air. My step-mother freaked out at that time and opened her window. She thought that it may of been a helicopter( I have since lived by a hospital that life flights out and know better). There was absolutley no sound what so ever. Not even a car motor. It remained there for about a minute and then it raised a little more.  Then, suddenly it shot kind of diagonal into the sky. And eventually straight up and out of sight. I would like to put that the speed that it traveled was amazing. Not helicopter like at all. I do not know if it was from this world or not but I do know what I saw. What my whole family saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

I was sitting facing almost due west in a small parking lot on business hwy35/Steele rd. I was looking out the windshield and started seeing something shiny and small coming toward me about 60ft in the air.  There was a small antenna tower behind the building I was in front of so I tried to estimate the height by the tower. It couldn&#39;t have been much higher than that. The closer it got the more confused I became.  At first (with the sun setting behind) I thought it was an ultralight flying due to the slowness and altitude.  But then I realized it wasn&#39;t one object but 5.  I have excellent vision, especially from far off, so I knew within the space of about 30 seconds it was more than one thing coming in my direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As it flew closer and went over my head it seemed like they were almost floating.  They were totally silent. They looked like big chrome balls, about 2.5-3 feet in diameter, and they were in a v-formation.  The reason I say &#34;chrome&#34; is because I could see reflections of everything around me in the balls.  Maybe they were mirrored, I don&#39;t know.  They flew right over my head and just kept going. I lost sight of them almost immediately because across the street from where I was parked there is a farmhouse with big oaks in the front yard. It looked like they were traveling roughly parallel to Steele Rd.  I have never come across anything like that in any description of a ufo. It still drives me crazy that I have no real idea of what those things were.  Were they some kind of drone?  Did they have some little creature in them?  No blinking lights, no sound.  I didn&#39;t feel anything weird except jaw-dropping amazement.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Just me for years afterward wondering what the heck they were.<n>
