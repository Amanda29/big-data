I was 17 at the time and living with them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The three of us went outside and Witness #1 directed our attention to two bluish-gray chevron or boomerang shaped objects low on the horizon.  They were identical in size, color and shape with one exception explained below.  Instead of being parallel to the horizon, both objects were perpendicular to it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The objects appeared to be about 1 mile north of us traveling west at very low speed, perhaps 5 mph or less.  The lead object was perhaps 500 to 1,000 feet in front of the second object.  We did not hear any sound from the objects, but I did not expect to since they appeared to be about a mile away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Witness #1 went back into the house and returned with a pair of 10 X 50 binoculars.  All three of us had a turn viewing the objects with them.  I noticed while viewing through the binoculars the top third of the second object was blinking into and out of sight (similar to a fluorescent bulb immediately after being turned on) at the rate of about once per second.  I was left with the impression the second object was experiencing mechanical problems or some sort of malfunction and was being escorted or possibly towed by the first object as the distance between them never deviated.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After watching the objects for several minutes, they both disappeared behind some trees and we never discussed the incident again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of sighting is approximate.  One of several seemingly high-quality reports from the same source, who describes himself as a public employee, who had a great deal of responsibility.  We suspect tha the witness is a very good observer.  PD))<n>

I was about 10 to 12 years old. I was in my yard and turned opposite the river to face downhill. Across the street silently hoovering above my grandfathers house was a saucer shaped craft with half egg shapes on the top and bottom. There were green and orange lights on top and I&#39;m not sure those colors are correct since I&#39;ve put the memory away a long time. It was early evening the light was waning but the ship was clear to see because it was so close. I can&#39;t remember how long I stood there and stared at it. I guess I was mesmerized. I don&#39;t remember any fear or panic. The weird part is my mother and her best friend were 100 feet behind me looking out over the river engaged in coversation. I remember later telling her what had happened. I don&#39;t remember the ship leaving. Years later she had no memory of me telling her any such story. I told my grandfather the story at a family get together when I was 30. He was a no nonsense German Catholic who believed in hard work. He said years earlier when my mother was young, she and a sister and brother were in the back seat of grandfathers car when they saw a UFO in a field outside of town. He pulled the car over and watched until it left. He said it matter of fact like watching a flock of birds leave. My mother doesn&#39;t remember this either. This is my only sighting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

I was asked to empty the teapot and make a new one for our guest.  I took the teapot out the back door to empty it and as i looked up in the sky i was freightened to see these two massive bright yellow teardrop lights (not pulsating). These two objects had their larger ends facing each other and the smaller ends appeared turned up resembling the cartoon devil eyes.  It was hard to determine if it was one ship and these were the windows or was it two ships.  The sky appeard so dark around these lights.  3 tiny lights were in between the larger ends but unable to say wheather or not they may have been stars. I don&#39;t recall any noise.Appart from the shape they didn&#39;t seem to have a 3D effect and i have no idea how big they actually were.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I got over the shock i tried to get my mother to come out and witness it but by the time i convinced her there was nothing but a bright glow over the hills to the west.  She said it was reflection of the moon.  I didn&#39;t buy this for a minute and have been curious about what i saw and perhaps sending my story to you will help me get over the experience but i kind of want to see another one so i would know that wasn&#39;t seeing things.  This happened when i was 16, I am now 45. I never indolged in drinking at that age and never drugs.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

We first thought it was a commercial jet, but we heard no engine sound at all.  I estimate the altitude to have been fifteen to twenty thousand feet.  About the time the object was directly overhead, we heard what sounded like a military aircraft in hot pursuit.  Its rate of closure was fast enough that it was about to overtake the silent object.  We stood transfixed as the silent object made a precise 90 degree turn to the southwest and accelerated OUT OF SIGHT in no more than two seconds, leaving the military aircraft helplessly behind.  We watched for a short time after that, but nothing else happened.  That is all we saw.  I verbally verified it with my elderly friend to be sure we both saw the same event.<n> <n><n> <n><n> She confirmed that she had.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About the same period of time, I can&#39;t remember if it was before or after, along this same stretch of road, a farmer lost some of his pigs to mutilation.  Their nostrils and rectums were surgically removed.  No tracks led up to or away from the carcasses.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Local law enforcement was unable to make any determination as to who or what it was.

It happened in Maple valley WA near Lake Francis 244th se and 188th cross street. I was a student in the 7th grade It was not a ball of light or anything like that , it was a craft with shape and design. There seemed to be an aura or haze just after it vanished.<n>

I was ten years old and at home playing in the yard.  It was sunny. A change in the afternoon light caught my eye.  I looked to the sky and saw a spherical object that appeared as a bright yellow light and hovered in the direction of the Sangster International Airport. It hovered for approximately 5 seconds.  There was no engine noise.  Then, in a sudden movement, it moved behind some gathering clouds and disappeared.  I lived near the airport and was quite accustomed to seeing planes land and take-off, and hearing the noise of aircraft, everyday.  This was no ordinary aircraft.  I remember my heart racing for a few moments as I was quite scared and excited by what I had seen.  I have never again seen anything remotely like that.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous.  Date is approximate.

She worked at a local hospital, and she was a doctor!  I at that time was a stay home mother!<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have had 6 encounters through my life, this was one of them, at the same apt.  I got up a few years later to go to the bathroom and there was an alien in the bathroom, I seem to know her!  I asked her if I could touch her and she let me touch her hand to be sure she was real!  The same alien was out here in the desert around 20 years ago and she informed me that they are not from another planet, that they are from our future 25 thousand years from now, that we could not find any life on any other planet so we found a way to use time travel and we changed our dna!<n> <n><n> <n><n> The first time we were living out in a desert and they came to our car and took us out after my mother went crazy over what was happening to us, they were all white and glowing, we hovered over the desert floor, we were taken into a foggy yellow whitish fog and the next day we were back in the car and my sister tried to tell our parents what had happened and my step dad asked her to point to where they took us and as she did a cactus came up from the ground and went through her hand and all we did was try to remove the needles !!Now this was around 1951 or 52!<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

It was dull aluminum in color, made no sound, and left no trail. I was taking my baby daughter to daycare before going to work as a school teacher. I was terrified and pulled over to watch. The craft finally went out of sight and i resumed my journey. I called Columbus Air Force Base, and they said they were&#39;nt interested. I had never seen such a craft before, but when i related the sighting to my family, they treated me shamefully and said i must be crazy!<n>

At approx. 3:00 in the morning, my backyard suddenly lit up with a brilliant bright, white light.  The light came from above the trees because the shadows looked like shadows at noon.  There was no wind to disturb any of the trees or shrubbery.  Above the trees were yellow and red strobing lights.  Accompaning the bright lights was a very high pitch warbling sound (think typical sci-fi sound effect).<n> <n><n> <n><n> I pulled on some pants and ran outside with my dad but by this time the object had turned on what sounded like a jet engine and headed toward the east.  The warbling continued but the primary sound was one of a jet.<n> <n><n> <n><n> With the departure of the object, everything returned to quiet.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We have rarely spoken about this incident.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

It was a clear day with no cloud cover or smog. Suddenly a disk-shaped craft, not very big, zipped down over Crown Mountain in a curvilinear movement and hovered over southern Vancouver, directly in the center of my vision. There was no sound or fumes, and, although the craft was clearly technologically skilled in design and fabrication, it was equally clear that there was a sentient being controlling it, as it moved with choice and a certain sense of style, and not in a robot-like way. And although it was still quite far away from my window (approx. 2 miles) i felt uncomfortable by the way it was hovering so deliberately in front of me; as if it was looking directly at me somehow. That was just my subjective feeling, but i record it in case others might also have felt that way.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Before i had a chance to draw my breath and yell to my family, the craft zipped off again, down the valley, going at an incredible speed. The total distance covered by the craft in the space of under a minute (including hover time) was approximately thirty miles.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At the time i was 12 years old and not under the influence of drugs or alcohol, devout and not given to lying.

It appeared somewhat like a gigantic jellyfish; a living organism floating approximately 3500 feet above the ground.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The event lasted a long 3 to 5 minutes.  Afterwards, this phenomenon slowly swirled toward the horizon, disappearing into the eastern sky.

No windows or doors seen. A slow buzz was the only sound it made. It got closer to the ground as I stood by myself staring at this strange object(I was twelve years and five months old then). It descended to about 20 to 25 feet from the ground and radiated heat as it neared the ground, not scorching heat, but you could feel the temperature raise. Suddenly it went straight up to the sky on a perfect straight angle and dissapeared at tremendous speed.<n>

The telephone operator was very quiet for a moment, and then replied, &#34;Oh, my God -- you saw it too?&#34;  She then said the Kings Island had not participated in any type of advertising, and that she had witnessed the same object from a different location the night before.

It was fall in small town Iowa, Onawa. My best friend’s mother sent us to get cigarettes for her (if that doesn’t tell you how long ago nothing will). The railroad tracks ran through their back yard. On the other side of the tracks was a large grassy area owned by the railroad. My best friend, her younger brother and I were just crossing this empty area headed for downtown Onawa when we saw a slow moving object in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was between 8-10 years old as was my best friend, and very smart—later I found I have a genius IQ. I stood staring at the object and knew immediately that it wasn’t an airplane. My father was a jet mechanic for the Air Force during Korea and then the Air National Guard and had taken me to many air shows. Before and after seeing the object I have never seen an aircraft with square red lights, and believe me, I have looked. The object was saucer shaped, moving not far above the town. It had square red lights that lit sequentially from right to left with a gap that made it seem like the lights were running around the object. There was no sound as it moved along, moving south to north. As we watched a building blocked our view. We ran to see if we could catch a further glimpse of it, but it had vanished.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My friend’s younger brother told me later that he had seen the same object one night hovering above the grain elevators two blocks from his house. He saw a beam of light coming from the object trained on the elevator for a few moments, then it took off. Because we were children no one believed us, but I went home and drew a picture of it so I could remember it and look for a logical explaination as I got older. So far I have found no aircraft with square red lights on it, but I&#39;m still looking.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Source indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.
