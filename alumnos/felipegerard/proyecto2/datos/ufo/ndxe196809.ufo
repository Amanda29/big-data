According to my brothers, this object was rectangular in shape,about 50m square in dimension,at an altitude of about 300m (only an estimation), the object had port-holes and was silent.<n> <n><n> <n><n> But as a kid, what struck me most was the fact that my brothers said the object constantly changed colours &#34;throughout the spectrum&#34;.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Recently, I quizzed both my brothers on the incident, this gave new elements to their story; apparently, the craft was not perfectly rectangular, but the bottom of the craft resembled the hull of a ship...<n> <n><n> <n><n> Also, after about 1min in a stationary position, the craft fell, in the words of my brother &#34;as if you let a feather drop from your hand&#34;, the curb/or trajectory then sent it east in the direction of Wales in the UK.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

This station was on Woodbridge Avenue and led up to a town about two and a half miles away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At that time the Raritan Arsenal was on the east side of the road and there was a strip of woods about a half a mile wide owned by the arsenal running up to the  the town on the other side of the road.  They saw a light go down in the woods and he closed the station down.  They drove up there and told everyone for about a week that they saw a flying saucer on the side of a service road.  Then, very oddly, if anyone asked about it, they would deny knowing anything about it.  They had spoken to the FBI, and maybe this had something to do with it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was sriving down this road some time after this, and the traffic was stalled.  At some point I saw an MP directing traffic in the  road and thought to myself that this was the place were those people saw that thing.  The army had the woods there roped off and a tracter trailer on the side of the road.  Some time after this I was shooting my shotgun back there and walked into a field and thought for a moment that I was standing where there had been a fire, probabley in the summer, fires being common from people sitting back there and throwing cigarettes out the window.  But I then saw that there was a smooth edge to the area and the grass was not burnt but scortched, and I was standing on the edge of a circular area about a hundred feet across, with all the bushes, mostly blueberry and about six or eight feet tall and everything else crushed down.  There was no construction going on there, and this would be a hard hoax, since it would require heavy machinery and controlled burning near fire towers.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I can&#39;t find anything about this.  If you have information, it might be listed under the Raritan Arsenal, the Edison Arsenal, or the Woodbridge Arsenal.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Also, in 1993 I reported a strange light, and the next night there was a completly silent helicopter that flew by my house for at least an hour and a half.  If you know anything about this sort of thing, I would be grateful to know<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

The object was on the eastern horizon in the early evening.  It appeared to be a few miles away.  However, by far the most salient feature was the light coming off the craft.  It came in long rays - just like you might see in the movies or on X-files.  We could see these rays come from the craft to us - kind of like we were being scanned somehow.  The rays were very long and surprisingly s-l-o-w.  This continued for 10-15 seconds.  The rays were transparent but slightly dark - kind of like long veils of silk. The craft kind of dissolved into space after this &#34;apparent&#34; scan.  Over the time it was in our sight it covered about 10-15 degrees of arc.  It was probably at a height of several hunder feet but not above the clouds. This experience was shared by myself and a friend.  We were shooting baskets in the schoolyard. It was unforgettable. Make of it what you can!<n>

However there were multi-colored lights ringing the craft. We were all of the opinion that it was at a fairly low altitude and there was absolutely no noise emenating from the craft.  It was traveling from the Northeast to the Southwest at a rather slow speed and eventually it disappeared behind trees.  I really do not believe that it was a blimp because the part of Iowa we saw it is pretty rural.<n>

Dak.  I&#39;d been chosen for TDY training.  Finishing early one day, my former crew of Security Police returned from 3 days afield.  They were buying all the binoculars &amp; cameras they could afford.  It seems a ball of light was hovering up &amp; down over a missile site in &#34;India&#34; Flt.(White Owl/Plainview area). The Strike Team was sent to check unusual alarms &amp; reported it.  The dayshift crews(SP)and cook went up to the roof of the LCF &amp; watched this action in the distance for several hours.  The &#34;Capsule Crew&#34; officers reported strange readings on their monitoring instrumentation.  The Missile Wing Hdqrs. back at Ellsworth called the LCF Security NCO, saying: &#34;You DO have something out there, don&#39;t you?&#34;  The object was never seen again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This event occurred about 2 months after Rapid City newspapers reprinted accounts from papers in Wyoming and Colo. about USAF Security Police Strike Teams (2-man, in a pickup truck)had been &#34;chased&#34; from missile sites all the way back to Base, not just the LCF, at full speed, in those states.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Since I read the newspaper accounts and had worked with these peers, I&#39;d have expected some report of this to be on-file.  Apparently, such is not the case.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was NOT a witness to the object, itself.  If my peers had been joking, they would not have purchased the items mentioned.  All of us had SECRET clearances at the time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> To my knowledge, none of my peers were &#34;warned&#34; at all, about keeping this &#34;quiet.&#34;<n>
9/10/68 21:00|Tontitown|AR|Unknown|1-1/2 minute|Mysterious illuminated cloud appears over the National Forrest.|2/24/07|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/055/S55343.html|11|ndxe196809| Mysterious illuminated cloud appears over the National Forrest.<n> <n><n> <n><n> One September night in 1968, at around 9:00PM we were watching our B&amp;W television when a sudden static interference and noise came onto the television that sounded as if a large engine was trying to start.  The interference caused vertical lines on the television as opposed to the normal horizontal lines caused by a passing aircraft in those days when using a VHF antenna.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My father hurried and went outside and saw a small cloud hovering near the tree tops over the Ozark National Forrest which was located about a mile to the West of our house.  This small cloud had a straight lightening bolt from its center going to the ground.  When the lightening bolt ended, the television static and the starting noise ended.  This bolt of lightening reappeared 3 times and lasted for about 5 to 10 seconds each time with a 15 seconds delay between them.  The cloud was slightly illuminated with a white-bluish light and remained stationary during this whole time.  I ran outside just in time to see the last bolt of lightening and after it ended, the cloud disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> One of our neighbors that lived at the South side of the National Forrest called my Dad and asked him if he had seen the lightening and heard this motor trying to start up in the forest?  The sky was clear that night with no other clouds in the sky but this very low strangely illuminated cloud.  It was very eerie!<n> <n><n> <n><n> A couple of months later in November, during our Thanksgiving holiday school break, my brother and I decided to venture into the National Forrest and look for some kind of clue to what this could have done to the ground or the trees in the forest.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We found an approximate three foot diameter by twenty foot deep hole in the ground.  The edges were straight as if a plug had been removed from the earth.  There was no loose dirt or rocks in or around the hole.  No sign of the dirt that was removed.  There were three triangle shaped pad prints, approximately one foot in size embedded into the ground around the hole at equal spaces.  This hole in the ground was among the trees where a vehicle could not get into and at that time there was no road access into that part of the forest.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My Dad informed the local Forest Ranger, who was another neighbor, to find out if this hole in the ground was some project the Forest Service had going.  He went to investigate because he had no knowledge of any kind of operation going on in the forest.  When he went to investigate, he put a fence up around the hole to keep game animals from falling into the hole becoming trapped as he found had already happened.  He was amazed of this and called the Sheriff.  No one ever came up with an explanation or figured out what had taken place there.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was only 10 years old at the time and I can still remember this as if it happened yesterday.  My Dad, the neighbor, and the Forest Ranger have all since passed away.  I am sure this hole still remains in the forest with no explanation of how it got there.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

9/10/68 19:00|Colorado Springs|CO|Sphere|3-5 minutes|Possibly observed a "mother ship" with three smaller craft darting about it.|2/18/01|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/016/S16321.html|12|ndxe196809| Possibly observed a &#34;mother ship&#34; with three smaller craft darting about it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At the time I was by myself in the back yard of a friend whose home was at the foot of the Rocky Mountains. Skies were clear with just a few wispy clouds. While admiring the sun setting over the mountains, I noticed four bright spheres of light traveling due west at a high altitude and a fairly high rate of speed. Because the sun was reflecting off of the surface of these crafts, I could not make out any details. However, one craft was much larger than the other three and it traveled in a straight line. What made this sighting unusual was that the other three craft kept darting around the larger craft, which made no sense. Understand that I was in the Air Force at the time, and I worked at NORAD inside of Cheyenne Mountain where my group analyzed secret data about new satellite launces worldwide. At first when I observed these bright craft, I thought that three fighters were trailing behind a tanker plane to refuel. However, I soon realized that none of the craft were lining up behind the tanker. In addition, these craft as a group did not form either a V or diamond or box pattern, which is required by military law. Instead, the three smaller craft seemed as if they were &#34;hotdogging,&#34; and at the rate of speed they were traveling and as close as they seemed grouped, this struck me as very dangerous. I watched these craft, scratching my head all the time, for three to five minutes until they disappeared over the mountain range. I later discussed this event with some of Air Force friends, but none of them did not see the event nor had they witnessed anything like it. This event prompted me to go out and by several books about UFO sightings. While paging through one of the books, I came across a chapter about &#34;mother ships,&#34; and that they had been observed to have smaller craft darting around them. As soon as I read that, I realized that that was what I had witnessed. I will admit that it&#39;s possible that three fighters were hotdogging around a tanker, but I guarantee you if the pilots had been caught, they! would h ave been court-martialed.  By the way, I was in the Air Force for eight years, and though I witnessed hundreds of all types of aircraft in the skies, I never saw an event like I did on that one particular day.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

It was about 9pm, in the fall, September.  I was pacing back and forth next to the sidewalk, speaking with my girlfriend, who was sitting on the curb.  As I turned and faced north, out of the corner of my eye, I saw a light in the sky.  I turned and faced it and pointed at it and said &#34;Look!&#34;.  My girlfriend jumped up and we both watched it for about 10 seconds.  Then I ran to the front door of my home and yelled at my family to come see.  They were slow to respond.  By the time I went back to my original position to look at it, it was gone.  My girlfriend said it went over the small mountains to the south east.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Its appearance - flawlessly circular, burnt orange, constant hue with small mechanical like random pulsations of equal size on its surface.  Moving slowly in a straight line, silent!   Size difficult to determine, because of it&#39;s circular shape, and dark blue background of the clear night sky.  My best estimate - between 40 to 200feet dia, approx. altitude of 400 to 1000ft, approx. speed  40-50 mph. Direction - north north east to south south west.  About 10 degrees off of horizontal, decline.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The most striking characteristic of this object was:  silent operation.  No sound whatever.  Also, the appearance of the random pulsations against the burnt orange surface.  And it&#39;s apparent size in the sky.
