It appeared to be the size of a half dollar in your outstretched hand. There were no clouds and I could see stars clearly and the lights of an airplane.  The object appeared to be circular but it was as if I was observing it through thick clouds which made the object look fuzzy.  I did not observe a tail like a comet&#39;s tail but a streak of light that appeared to be the same green color.<n>
11/30/99 19:00|Ephrata|WA|Unknown|20 minutes|Two craft 3 miles from each other close to the ground seen by two in Central Washington November 1999|1/22/04|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/034/S34594.html|4|ndxe199911| Two craft 3 miles from each other close to the ground seen by two in Central Washington November 1999<n> <n><n> <n><n> THIS IS ABOUT THE: Sightings of two different UFOs within moments of each other in central Washington State, November 1999.<n> <n><n> <n><n> LOCATION:  13 miles north of EPHRATA (pronounced E - frA - ta) WASHINGTON on Sagebrush Flats Road.  (Sagebrush flats road goes at a North by Northwest track from the town of Ephrata to the south.)  TIME:  about 7 pm PST (Dark outside), November 1999  SETTING ONE: About 13 miles northwest of Ephrata, Sagebrush flats road comes out of a small canyon (gentle rolling hills on either side of the road) onto a 2 mile wide (north to south) and 5 mile long flat area with wheat farms and high power transmission lines.  The lines are suspended upon the very tall erector-set towers such lines are usually found on.  The high power lines cut across the flats coming from the Northeast (Grand Coulee Dam) and going to the Southwest.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I was traveling north and approaching the high power lines, I noticed a very bright light traveling very slowly (maybe 10 miles an hour) an estimated 20-50 feet above the lines.  It was to the northeast and coming towards me – as the road intersects under the lines at a 90 degree angle.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The single light was very bright; such that I couldn’t see the craft behind it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Not wanting to be directly under the craft when it got to my location, I went maybe 1/8th mile north on the road – all the while watching the light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I stopped the car and got out to watch.  There was absolutely NO sound from the craft holding the light.  I watched as the light came to the road and made a 90 degree turn to its left and slowly followed Sagebrush road south.  As it slowly, and at a very low altitude, approached the small canyon, the canyon and adjacent rolling hills were illuminated as if it was a bright summer day.  Since the craft/light was now going away from me, I could not see the light, just the effects of the lights illumination.  I still could not see nor hear the craft holding the light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I watched for maybe 10-15 minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> SETTING TWO: My home is about three miles northwest (as a crow flies) of where I saw the light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I got home to my wife, I said to her, “You will not believe what I just saw.”  My wife excitedly interrupted with, “You will not believe what I just saw.”  She went on to tell me that 15-20 minutes before I got home (the same timeframe of my sighting) she had stepped outside and looked up to the east.  Hovering, maybe 50 feet above her was a very large (an estimated 150 feet to each side) black triangular shaped craft.  It made no sound.  At each corner were several small bright orange/red lights.  These corner lights gave enough definition of the craft for her to tell it was triangular.  She watched for maybe two minutes and then, out of fear, stepped back into the building.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There isn’t any way these two craft (my light carrier and my wife’s black triangular craft) could be the same craft.  It seems too much of a coincidence that these two craft were in the same general area at the same time.  I’ve always wondered if the light bearing craft was looking for the triangular craft.  That possibly, the triangular craft was hugging the ground for stealth reasons.<n> <n><n> <n><n> NOTE:  I should mention that this remote farming country has frequent daily (and nightly) over flights by military craft coming from the airbase in Spokane, Whidbey Island Naval Air Base north of Seattle, McCord Air Force base outside of Tacoma, and from Canada.  None of the usual military over flights are of strange craft.  Some are large but quiet (not silent) craft.  I felt my sighting was probably of a manmade craft – just silent and for some reason closely navigating the high-power transmission lines.  My wife and I have no idea of the origins of the large black triangular craft she saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I stopped and stayed in my car while it continued to descend until it was hidden from my view behind a 3 or 4 story building.  It was a large oval shape. The underside was completely illuminated in a white light with several flashing white lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was traveling north by automobile in central Palm Springs on El Segundo St. between the convention center and the Spa Hotel &amp; Casino on November 30, 1999 at about 5:45 pm. I observed a large oval object in the sky coming towards me in a southwesterly direction. I stopped and stayed in my car while I observed it. I had no competition from street lights since Palm Springs has few of them. It was at a low altitude and was descending. I continued to watch it until it was hidden from my view behind a 3 or 4 story building. The underside was completely illuminated in soft white light.  Several flashing white lights were located around the perimeter.  I continued to observe it for about 3 minutes. It did not resemble a blimp, but I did try to contact the Palm Springs Airport but was unable to navigate through the menus to reach a human to confirm if a blimp had been in the area.<n>

He sd that all of a sudden he had a weird feeling come over him, his earphones began to have static.  HE looked behind him and there was nothing there,then all of a sudden a bright light shined over his shoulder, and dissappeared in a second.  Sd that then he noticed several airplanes ( seven or eight)flying overhead in a different directions.  Most were not commerical, he thought thhat was strange too because he sd that he had never noticed that much activity in the sky in the past.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We have not received any other reports of unusual activity in Illinois as of the time of this writing.  The only conventional aircraft we are aware of that might cause em interference are E3A/AWACS and EA6B &#34;Prowlers,&#34; although any military aircraft with &#34;look down&#34; radar might be able to cause such radio interference.  However, those types of aircraft generally do not fly 1) at low altitude over populated areas and 2) in formations of 6 or 7 aircraft.))<n>

I had spent the night in Markham , Ontario, North of TOronto  at my son&#39;s house as I live too far to go home to Peterborough, Ont. when I teach at night.  As we do smoke inside of the house, I got up around 6:30 and went right away outside to have a cigarette...(bad addiction but..) It was cool and crisp with a clear sky and a bit nippy. The sky was very clear.  The moon was there over the garage and also the usual little star that I see every morning as I leave early. To my surprise I observed a triangle shaped object that seemed to move towards the earth???? It got bigger and bigger as it came closer. I watched it on my frontlawn for approx. 15 minutes and then went back to get a coffe as I did not believe what I had seen! It was something I had never seen before.  I stayed inside for a few minutes and went out again and it was still there! I am not on medication, and do not have apocalyptic visions although I am aware of the Millennium anxiety.  I am a professional in my 50&#39;s (Technical French translator and part-time French teacher at the college level.<n>

I see two faint dots of light moving toward the pole star like satellites in polar orbit. One, however, was converging on the other. Near the top of my field of vision, about 5 degrees of arc from the two dots I saw a quick meteoric flash. The second dot then grew very bright, brighter than Venus, which also shown in the sky in the the Southeast, quite a way from both the dots and the meteor.  Right after the quick meteor flash, the second dot turned around the first dot and then they both continued on with the second dot behind the first and back to the faint moving point of light it had been as it converged on the first.<n>

Vivid green lights could be seen from the outside of the object with red lights in the center. We recorded the object on and off for approximately an hour using an 8mm comcorder with a 64x digital zoom.  We ended up with about a half hour of tape.  On the tape, the object  appeared to be circular in shape with the green lights coming from the outside and red lights coming from a dome in the center.  It appeared to move closer and then farther away, at times becoming indistinct on the tape at its closest.  Then, near the end of the tape, it seemed to take on a mushroom-like appearance and became white in color.  At around 02:00, it seemed to move from south to north.  I can send a copy of the aforementioned videotape.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note--Upon receipt of this report, we first suspected a twinkling star as being the cause.  However, the objects reportedly were not visible on the following night, according to the source.))<n>

At that instant he looked up at a easterly angle towards the little dipper, when he did he said wow,what is that ? I had already looked up by that time and noticed a disk shaped object with a dark center and white around the outside. it was not a light but more like white against a dark sky. the object traveled from about three feet of my sight to the left of the little dipper as scale to about a foot to the right of it in a straight line and then dipped downward at about a seventy degree angle for about a second and then turned right at a 90 degree angle and traveled directly away from me for about a second and a half before dissapearing from sight. This area is near L.A. international airport and there is alot of air traffic and after seeing the object we compared times of airplanes covering approximatly the same diastance and by our estimations the object was traveling 50 times faster than a commercial airliner. and covered the complete horizon in about three and a half seconds. I am a 39 year old male and my occupation is a printer. my friend is a 39 year old truck driver. He and I agreed immidiatly afterwards that we had never seen anything even remotly like this and I had never even entertained the thought of seeing a U.F.O. in my neighborhood. We were at liberty park playing a game of night frisbee disc golf when the sighting occured.<n>

No trail. Very bright and green...heard about these on Art Bell over the last few months, but first time in 45 years seeing one! I&#39;ve seen lots of meteors...but this things was huge and was very strange because it didn&#39;t appear to &#34;burn-out&#34; just went to far down in the horizon to see it any more and it never became smaller either. Plus because it had obviously brighter areas on it, which gave it a kind of 3-D appearance and was fuzzy all around the edges of the sphere. I was with my fiancee when we both saw this, which I was very glad that he had also seen it since I he had been with me two nights ago when I saw another odd object in the sky(see earlier report form). I was coming back from picking him up from his work place tonight.  I called two local TV stations but no one else had called it in. Channel 8 asked for my name and phone number, and Channel 39 said to call back and speak to their meteorologist, which I will in a few minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Same area of town approximately as earlier sighting on 11/27/99.<n>

At first I thought it was a star or planet (was brighter then Jupiter) as it was starting to get dark and stars were starting to appear in the twilight.  Then I noticed it was moving slowly south, and my impression was it must be an airplane landing light. (To the east and southeast is the landing pattern for flights coming into Burbank Airport.)  But as I watched the light suddenly went out.  I noticed a very faint star like appearance in the same vicinity moving in the same direction for a few seconds as I searched for the object, and then it was gone. I thought that was odd.  I then noted a couple of planes coming into Burbank further away than what I had seen and a light plane flying in the northeast, none of which looked like what I had seen.  Thinking about this now, it was as if something had jumped from near to far instantly.  Also the light went out and I didn&#39;t see anything until I noticed the very faint star-like object in the area and it also seemed to be moving southward, albeit more slowly.  I also see planes coming in from San Francisco or so in the western skies (to LAX), but have never seen anything flying above Jupiter Mountain using landing lights.  Jupiter Mountain is south of me and across the valley.  I am at 3000 foot elevation and Jupiter Mountain is 5000 foot elevation and about 1.5 miles away across the valley.  I am in the Angeles Forest, a 50 mile drive from Burbank, 18 miles south to Santa Clarita  and 18 miles in the other direction to Palmdale.  The time was about 5 PM.<n>

Me and my friend both exclaimed &#34;WOW&#34;, and saw the light move from about 80 degrees to about 30 degrees in less than 2 seconds, Westwards. It is the fastest moving object we have seen, and we do not believe that it was a rocket. We also exclude it from being a falling star (green color).<n>

I saw two round objects which seemed quite large flying VERY slowly (one slightly behind the other). They made no sound.What amased me was how slowly they flew and the amount of light they made. The &#34;flying objects&#34; were travelling from east to west. The other driver also stopped and was amazed at what he had also seen.<n>

The apparent meteor left a long trail, was very bright, was white in color, and flickered like a fireball.  At the end of it&#39;s visibility it seemed to flash and disappear.  It made no sound.  I witnessed the object just above and to the right of my dead-ahead horizon point.  I watched the object travel very quickly from upper right to lower left of my field of view, from about 30 degrees to about 10 degrees above the horizon.  (this may be skewed a bit because I was on a city street with lots of 3-6 storey buildings on both sides, and I was driving slightly uphill).  The object seemed very bright and very large and I would say that it is the biggest, brightest, longest-lasting meteor I have ever seen.  I say this because I try to go out to the country and watch meteor showers whenever I know about them, so I have seen lots of meteors.  I&#39;m sure that meteors are sighted all over the world every day, I am really curious if we are in the middle of a meteor shower right now and if anyone else in my part of the country also witnessed this object or other objects.  If you are able to follow up, please let me know.  I&#39;m curious.<n>

It was 8PM and the night sky was clear, black with no moon. The milky way was clearly visible. A brilliant white ball of light came into view; From the driver&#39;s point of view it entered from top left of the windshield, crossed over to just left of the middle and then blinked out.  From the passenger&#39;s point of view, it descended then accelerated parallel to the ground away from us fading from view. The light was huge, spherical, brilliant and white and would have measured 1/4 inch diameter at arm&#39;s length. I have watched the Leonid showers twice now, last year I counted 110 meterors in one hour, this year only 30 but with a spectacular finale. I can say for certain that this ball of white light did not resemble any of the 150+ meteors I have observed. It did not resemble the commet I saw several years ago, or any object I have ever seen. It traveled at the speed a blue angel would travel during an air show in a dive toward the ground. It&#39;s speed was not as fast as the meterors I have watched. It was also huge in comparison to the meterors I have seen. Unlike the meterors, there was no trail of debris behind it. The passenger described the light as having a metallic look after it dimmed and thought it was some sort of craft which accelerated away from us but I can&#39;t confirm that observation as I was also watching for cattle on the open range; having previously come upon a group of cattle standing in the middle of the road. The sighting lasted between 5-8 seconds in which time the passenger was telling me to flash my ligths at it, I had time to do just that before we lost sight of it.<n>

I&#39;ve satellites at twilight in space, this was not a satellite.  This was within the atmosphere (2500 FT up) NO sound. It moved from NW to SE at very high rate of speed.  Faster than any craft I&#39;ve ever observed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The craft appeared as a single steady white light against a clear sky.  Other craft have flown at the same approximate height and higher, including jets and travel at much slower speeds, additionally they all have some blinking or colorized light which is observable.  This caught my attention because of the steady FAINT white light (or reflection) AND the speed AND the silence.  Things were pretty quite just after midnight!  Yet this craft made NO sound and crossed my field of view within 3-4 seconds.  I could NOT decipher any shape whatsoever.  The light was oblong and at arms length from my distance of view and about the size of an aspirin, although it was not in space, nor near space, it was definitely between 2000-3000 feet in altitude.  The local airports are directly west of my location.  It came from the NW and was headed southeast, which is the Atlantic Ocean. The flight path of the craft I observed was unique.  I have lived at this location for twelve years and do not recall ever seeing a craft flying along the trajectory I observed this craft flying. Unfortunately, it all happened so fast, I was unable to photograph or film the sighting. I would like to know if anyone else by chance saw this? Or, if you have an explanation, please contact me.<n>

It was around 5am.  We stopped at ur last stop to pick up my friend.  His dad owned the farm where we were going to hunt. My brother and I were outside waiting for him.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were standing beside my truck.  It was still very dark but the sun was on the way up.  So we could see the tree lines.  I was looking back over the fields where we would be going to hunt when this ball of flame appeared.  It was about 700 yard from us.  It came up over the tree tops and was stationary there.  As I watched it You could tell it was moving.  It moved very slowly almost not noticeable but because of the tree tops I could tell it was moving.  It moved out and over to the middle of an open field.  I would say about 100 yards from where I originally saw it.  I would say it was as big as a recliner chair.  I never took my eyes off of it and watched it and just like someone turned off a light switch it was gone.  Not gone like it to! ok off just gone like it disapeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Needless to say I was scared to death to go into the woods there until it got light.  We always went in the woods long before daylight but not that morning.  To this day I dont know what I saw and probably will never know. My brother and I never talked about this again.  I was watching a UFO show tonight and thought i would share this.  I used to think people were crack pots.  But what we saw was real and unexplained and people wouldnt believe my story either thats why I never told anyone.  I hope this helps verify someone elses story that may have saw something like this.<n>

From my sixth floor Apartment window facing due west, and without any obstructed view, I observed the formation of contrails in the southwestern skies. They were flying at high altitudes and moving from west to east and east to west. Later others started to form from north to south making a matrix in the southwestern sky neat the setting sun. I noticed two very short contrails that were changing speeds and at times stopped in mid air and changed direction these contrails appeared as right angle slashes and could have easily gone unnoticed as they blended in with the whispy clouds. I observed them moving under independant control! They seemed to be able to lengthten or shorten the contrail emission. I also observed jet aircraft flying toward these objects. The objects would change postions when the aircraft was remotely near them. One object seemed to park in a postion facing the setting sun. The other was further west from the sun and was also parked for a good bit of the time. A jet flew toward its postion at a higher altitude. It took off from its stationary position in a 90o angle to the south west. Then it accellerated leaving a long dark colored contrail( all other contrails were white) behind it. When it accellerated I could clearly see a round reflective object at the head of the contrail. Its speed seemed very fast. Much faster than any of the other movement I saw. Then I decided I should try to report it.<n>

They were moving at a high rate of speed, and were maneuvering relative to one another.  At one point they came close together, then moved apart to form a v shape.  Four people, two adults and two children witnessed the event.  Also, the objects made no sound as they passed over.  It was clear with no clouds.  I am 5 miles south of LAX and we have seen many planes fly over.  We had never seen anything that could move east to west, and dart back and forth, north to south before.  The objects disappeared into the horizon to the west over the Pacific ocean.<n>

As stated, I had just scored (the winning shot I might add) and threw my head back, and hands up in victory, when I exclaimed &#34;What the heck is that?&#34; I saw 4  fairly dim &#34;lights&#34; if you will, bluish-green in color, tracking east to west at a pretty good clip. The speed, east to west was constant. Their speed relative to each other, varied. My first thought was they were those spotlights used for attracting attention to businesses around the area, except there were no clouds to reflect the light, nor were there any &#34;beams&#34; emanating from the ground. Lastly, spotlights travel in a set pattern, extending out from a focal point, then returning, these definitely came in from the east, and disappeared on the western horizon. Now, all the while, these four lights were not just moving east to west, but performed maneuvers similar to those of the previously mentioned spotlights. At one point, they all came together, sort of spun around each other, then separated back into a new formation. While almost directly overhead, two of them stayed stationary in the center, while the other two, (one on each side of the two stationary lights) made circles as they flew. A little hard to explain, but if you hold up two fingers on each hand, put the index fingers touching side by side, and start rotating the second fingers in opposite circles (one move clockwise, the other counterclockwise) you can get an idea of the formation as it passed overhead. Of course, the tips of your fingers will represent the lights themselves. Now remember, these varying &#34;formations&#34; are still moving at a constant speed east to west. They traveled somewhere between 3/4, and 1/2 of a persons field of view, meaning east horizon, to west horizon in just about 10-15 seconds. The speed seemed fast, yet they almost seemed to be moving in slow motion. They made no sound whatsoever, which was noted immediately, since they did not appear to be that high in the sky. I cannot guess at an altitu! de, because I don&#39;t know the actual size of the objects. If they were the size of a car, then I would guess somewhere between between 1000 to 1200 feet. (ONLY a guess)  The two children who also witnessed this are my kids, and while they were enthralled by what they were seeing, once the objects moved out of view, became very scared and &#34;clingy&#34; for a lack of a better word. They were obviously shocked by what they had seen. Like my friend said, we live close to the airport (actually 2, LAX, and the smaller Torrance airport), so we know what planes are, and the normal tell-tale signs. (shape, lights, engine noise, flight behaviors, etc.) We had to play it off in order to calm the kids down. Later that evening, after getting them calmed, in bed, and convinced the aliens were not landing tonight, I went back over to my neighbors to discuss what we had witnessed. We both agree that we don&#39;t know what we saw, but we don&#39;t want to label it, especially without any other evidence besides our own accounts. A very surreal experience.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

So I said to her, do you see that light? She looked ahead and said she see&#39;s it. Right as she said that the light just faded out. We both were like wow! And then it just re-appears at the one oclock position. We watched it for a second, and then it just faded out again. We did see a light that seemed similar, but it was very far in distance now. We thought we saw it again over some light towers near the tollway, but that light again just faded out. We don&#39;t know what the light was but it just seemed odd, a shimmering light that fades and re-appears in different locations.<n>

I yelled for my neighbors to come out and they did just in time.  The craft was staying in the same place and started going faster and finally disapeared.  It was going west to east.  After that I couldn&#39;t sleep.  When I get certain feeling it is usually right.  I had that feeling.  Not only is this the only sighting, I have seen 5 others. I have the strangest feeling that my hypothesis is correct that it was an ailien space craft.<n>

October or November of 1999 to be exact. I never reported it before because I never really told anyone about it before. I thought people would think I was crazy for claiming I saw a UFO. To this day, even though I saw one, and I know what I saw, I don&#39;t believe anyone when they say they&#39;ve seen one. That being said, here is my experience.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was living in Raleigh, North Carolina. My job was in Rocky Mount, North Carolina NE of Raleigh. This night I was driving to Rocky Mount to stay at my parents house because I had to wake up really early the next morning. Since I was going to be in town a friend and I decided to get some dinner. I was driving to the restaurant on highway 64 going east. I had just passed the Nashville exit when I saw a long, thin yellowish-orange light just above the tree line. It was insanely bright and perfectly still in the air. It looked to be about three or four football fields long. Maybe even longer. I seemed to be about 10 miles from it so I knew this thing was huge. I watched it as I drove down the highway occasionally losing it behind some trees as the highway curved. The whole I was watching this thing and driving, I ran down a list of things it could possibly be. The list included a blimp, which it couldn&#39;t have been because it was too big and perfectly still, it wasn&#39;t the hospital that I was going to be passing because it was to high in the air and the hospital is the tallest building in Rocky Mount but not that tall, and I was absolutely certain it wasn&#39;t a plane. It was to big, to bright, and motionless.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The last time I lost it behind some trees was the last time I saw it. I must have had my view of it blocked for 10 or 15 seconds maximum, but when the part of the sky it was in came into view again it was gone. I would have seen it fly away but didn&#39;t. In a matter of seconds I was under where it was floating on a clear sky so I would have seen it if it was still there but turned the lights off.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I pulled over at the exit, again, pretty much right underneath where it was. I was looking up and noticed to small, fast moving planes flying in from the SE. These were obviously fighter jets flying in formation from, I am assuming, Cherry Point, which is an Air Force base SE of Rocky Mount. The two jets circled, in formation, pretty much in the same spot the object was and flew away, back toward the SE.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I rolled my window up, put the car in gear, went to dinner and haven&#39;t spoken much of it since.<n>

Then all of a sudden they just shot straight up and then headed northeast. C. Two of us were wearing watches and they stopped during some part of this .There was really no specific sound - just a type of hum (almost like when your ears are stopped up). 4 of us were sick to our stomachs and experience diarrah for a couple of days.<n>

They were white lights and then the ones in the center came from white to reddish.   They didn&#39;t move but stayed in one spot the whole time.

They had no idea what it was so they took a left away from the lights.  As soon as they turned the lights must have came over two miles in two seconds the lights got right behind them.  About ten yards away.  The lights were like huge spot lights in a perfect strait line behind them. The lights followed them around curves and up and down hills, the kids were now going about 80 miles and hour and it was still behind them.  Suddenly they stopped and disappeared.  What was wierd was the 8 lights in perfect pairs of two spread out across the road, reaching beyond the telephone poles on both sides, but never broke any of them.  The lights were about 8 feet above the vehicle the kids were driving.  The lights were not higher than the poles, but never touched them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 3 boys were driving down a country road tuesday night about 9:00.  They were not to far from one of the boy&#39;s house.  They came to a &#34;T&#34; in the road and were going to go right.  When suddenly they saw 8 Bright lights in pairs of two about two miles away.  They thought is was four pickup trucks lined up, parked in a field.   Not many people live out there so they decided to go left instead of right, just because they didn&#39;t know who it was.  When the boys tured left, the lights started to move towards them in a perfect line ( **  **  **  **)just like that.  They thought all of the vehicles were coming towards them through the field in a strait line, so they stepped on the gas peddle.  They said it was not 2 seconds later and the eight lights were about ten feet behind them, the lights made the whole inside of the truck glow.  It was like 8 huge spot light hoovering above the road.  What was wierd, the lights stayed directly behind them for about a mile and a half as the boys drove eighty.  The lights spread across the road, and they were even much wider than the road, why did it not affect the telephone poles or trees, the lights went right through them.  The lights were directly behind the boys, or maybe just a few feet above them but not much.  The boys topped a hill, and went down it but the lights suddenly stopped.  The lights stayed on the hill, and the three boys will not go back there.   The boys are not lying, one of them has gratuated from high school, one is a junior, and the other a senior in high school.<n>

I was coming home from my math class that was held every Tuesday nighs from 6:00pm to 8:50pm at the Clovis Community College Center.  This one specific evening, I was taking an important Math exam and I didn&#39;t finish my last problem until 7:53pm.  By the time I got into my car, the time was exactly 7:56pm.  I started to turn the ignition on, I turned on my headlights, I turned the heater on and made sure that my doors were secure locked.  I put my reverse gear in, and backed out of the dark, cold desereted parking lot.  I turned left on Fir Ave.  Then, I turned another left onto Peach, where there&#39;s a Honda North dealership at the corner.  On Peach, I made a right turn to E Herndon then made a left turn on Willow.  As soon as I got onto Willow, that&#39;s when the UFO encounter happened.  I was driving along Willow when I put the right signal on, to turn into my residents.  That&#39;s when this bright white lights shot through my windshield.  The object was real similar to the incident that occured on July 24th, 1997 that had occured in Clovis, CA.  The object did not appear to have any sounds, but it was their blocking my view.  I kind of panicked because I&#39;ve never seen such bright white lights before.  I braked lightly and pulled over to the right curb.  I then looked around the sky, but apparently the object had diappeared.  Since then, I&#39;m always looking up in the sky to hope one day that I will see one and able to post my encounter on this anonymous forum.<n>

I was observing with binoculars.  the shape passed from left to right (horizontally), close to the moon&#39;s surface.  I would extimate that the length of the  object was approx 1/40 the diameter of the moon.  It passed across the moon in about four seconds.  As it passed, it cast a shadow on the moon.  The shadow on the moon was slightly higher than the object itself.  The shadow was the same size as the object (I suspect the object was very close to the moon, very large, and moved very fast).  The object was dark against the bright moon.  The shadow did not seem to be any darker than the object.  The object looked like a fat cigar or a skinny football.  As the object moved across the moon it could not be seen (no lights).  The object did not appear to be orbiting the moon (did not appear again).  Could it have been an asteroid?  This object was not in the same orbital plane as the moon around the earth.<n>

They did not blink, but rather had a pulsating glow at the center of them. They also had 2-3 lights that strobed white light very quickly. They did not move very quickly, probably at about 50-100 MPH, and i estimate that they were at an altitude of 1000 - 2000 ft. I was on the west hill of Kent, and i guess they were probably over the Kent Valley, which is a few miles away. They made no noise or sharpe movements<n>

My 2 daughters and I were up in the middle of the night but I forgot what we were doing. My younger daughter (a teenager) went out to get something out of her car on the street of our subdivision culdesac and came back in afraid of something going on outside. She called her sister to go outside to see it with her. they didn&#39;t want to tell me because they knew I&#39;d get in the car and go investigate it. So they stayed out there for about 10 minutes and then came running in to get me to come look at it too. They were scared and shaking all over, talking fast, explaining to me that they were seeing some sort of coded message going on with light across the field from our subdivision at a small aircraft airfield.<n> <n><n> <n><n> First of all, every animal for miles around was making noise. It was amazing to me that not one person got up to see what all the noise was about. Not one light went on in any houses around us. Every dog in all the neighborhoods we could hear were barking their heads off. The cows and sheep in the pastures around our subdivision for miles were mooing and baaing, without stopping. Constant. Something was going on, that was for sure. I&#39;d never before or since experienced such a thing with the animals. There was a slight fog in the air, so that sounds were sort of muted or diffused. Even though it was dark out and the sky was dark, we could see this cloud formation over at this little air field at the end of our subdivision, which was east of us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were in farmland area. The airport was only supposed to be for small aircraft, yet many times in the middle of the night, we heard big, loud, jets coming in for landings that woke us up with the booming of the jet whining as it came down and I feared it would crash into our house. Or land on our house, it was so low and so close. I wondered about that all the time. Many times, also, I would wake up in the middle of the night to broad daylight, I thought, as helicopters were in my backyard with bright lights shining in my high ceiling windows that I didn&#39;t have blinds for, shining lights into our yard. The helicopters were so low, they shook the house and were so loud, they woke us up along with the lights. I wondered why the neighbors never complained about this as it was a constant source of aggravation to us. I always suspected something funny was going on at that little airport, because these big aircraft, helicopters and things weren&#39;t supposed to be coming in and landing there. I don&#39;t remember hearing any taking off, either. Only landing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This one night with all the animals raising a ruckus, tho, something even stranger was going on. The girls pointed out to me a light across from us, across the field and landing strips of the small airfield that was either coming up from the ground going into the clouds or coming from the clouds going to the ground. It was impossible to tell because it would suddenly be there and then gone, in a straight bright thin light between the ground and the clouds. But it was a single white light like a laser light that would flash really fast and then go out in very sequential patterns like morse code. We stood shivering on the lawn watching it and counted as it would go, one, two, three, stop. One two three, four, stop. One, two, stop. One two, stop. Sometimes it would go all the way up to 21 and stop. But it would have repeating patterns of numbers. I never knew morse code, but I remember WWII movies and how it sounded as they tapped it out. This looked like what it would sound like, or it was obviously some message or code being played out before our eyes. It would pause between sets of numbers and then do another round of them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We stood there in the damp darkness, watching for at least 15 minutes, counting and wondering if we should be writing this down to see if someone could figure it out later. Someone who knew codes. The fog was weird, too, because it wasn&#39;t everywhere. It was here and there in patches, otherwise, it was a clear night. The whole night and outside had a strange, surreal feel to it. Not quite right. Something weird going on here. There were no clouds anywhere else but over the airfield where the light was going on and off. It was no beacon to warn planes and no spotlight. I&#39;d never seen it before or after in the 7 years I lived there. I wanted to get in my car and drive over there and see what was going on, close up, but the girls were too afraid and wouldn&#39;t let me go. They made me come in the house after awhile and were afraid of what was there and what it was doing. We watched out our living room window for another hour or more and it continued, unabated, while the animals never stopped making noise. Finally, we got tired and closed up all the windows and went to bed. I don&#39;t know how long it went on before we saw it or how long after we went to bed with all the animals howling. I still can&#39;t figure out how it didn&#39;t wake up the rest of the neighborhood, but not one opened a window and told their dogs to shut up or anything else. It was like we were the only ones alive on the planet or in the neighborhood to see and witness it.  About a year before that, we were standing talking in the driveway at night in the dark, and we saw a triangular black object with lights underneath slowly and silently go overhead while we watched it cruise by. It was pretty high up and very dark. Nothing reflected off it and it seemed flat and triangular. It came from the east, where the airport was and kept on going west right by us. I thought it was probably one of our military planes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> If anyone has ever heard of anything like these laser lights going from sky to ground or ground to sky of clouds, I would like to hear about it and figure out what it was. It&#39;s been on my mind and I keep wondering what it could have been, what we should have done differently to find out and to try to find out what we saw. Why we saw it and no one else woke up. Why the animals were carrying on. The helicopters bothered us the whole time we lived there. They also bothered us where we moved to where I saw another sighting I reported, in Santa Rosa. In fact, black helicopters have been bothering us ever since 1973, in every state and place we&#39;ve lived.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

I looked closer and realized what I was seeing and asked my mother if she wanted to see a UFO up close.  Then I awakened my Mother-in-law and my husband, when we came back upstairs it was heading slowly off towards the mountains.  When it reached the mountains it turned sideways to where the &#34;bottom&#34; of the craft was facing the house, the clouds arond the mountains were glowing with the light from the craft.  The first craft then desended behind the mountain and a few seconds later the second craft, coming from the southeast, approached the first at a high rate of speed and desended behind the mountains in the same area as the first.  The clouds stayed aglow for about forty-five to fifety minutes after they were no longer visible from behind the mountains, then the light just vanished. The first craft was only about a half a mile from the house when sighted, we live on five acres.  The craft was scaucer shapped with a small dome on the &#34;top&#34;, with extremely bright &#34;yellow&#34; and &#34;white&#34; lights around the exterior circumfrance of the craft and illuminated almost the entire five arces.  The &#34;bottom&#34; of the craft had a triangulare shape within the circumfrance of the craft with a red light in the center of the trangle.  Only the &#34;yellow&#34; and &#34;white&#34; lights rotated, or pulsed, counter clockwise around the craft, the red light was constant and glowed.  The second craft was the same configuration as the second where the lights are concerned, yet it was much smaller than the first.<n>

Craft was randomly shining light onto ground below it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Driving northbound on I-75 towards Lima, Ohio. We were just south of mile marker 117. Conditions were foggy and dark. Noticed mirror sphere like object moving slowly through a field just east of the highway. Object became noticed when the ground beneath it was lit up. There was no visible source on the craft as to where the light was coming from. The object was noticed as mirror like due to the fact that the ground was being reflected off of it when the light would activate. Unknown on the exact distance of the craft but it was fairly close. I pulled onto the shoulder where I could observe the object better. The object was moving southbound very slowly. The light would activate randomly and had no particular pattern. The light was no particular color and you could detect movement by the reflection off of the object while the light was on. When there was no light from the craft you could barely see it due to the fog but you could make out faintly the outline of the top portion. Traffic was sparse and other cars/trucks passed but no one had stopped. After a few minutes the passenger of my vehicle rolled down his window. We could hear no sounds but could still see the object. It them simultaneously lit up and area of trees to the north of us and the area where we were parked on the shoulder. The lights went off and the object left at a moderate speed north bound over the tree area it had just lit up. You could actually see the fog flow around it as it moved and thats when we got a good look at it. It had no visible windows or lights on its surface. It was smooth and shiny. The object faded out of view. We drove off slowly up the highway to see if we could pick it up again. But we had not seen any other lights ect...<n>

As I was watching out my window to make sure he was ok I saw a light coming up the street and I thought it was a neighbors car coming up the street and the light got closer and closer till it was upon him and circling around and on top of of him but I could not see where the light was coming from so I kept watching because I wanted to know what was going on.  Before I could make some sence out of it I saw, the reflection of lights that were upon him were glemming off of our work van parked infront of our house, I than saw two round colored lights about the size in-between a tennis ball or a soft ball one was red and the other was amber.  I was also assuming that the craft had to be over my house for the reflection to appear in the work van and as fast as it appeared on the van it was gone like it knew it could be spoted.  The whole experence lasted about 30 seconds I just could&#39;nt beleive my eyes when I saw what I saw.  I also feel that this UFO was going to take my husband away because the lights were all around him like they were trying to take him for some weired experiment.  So when it left I brought him inside the house to be on the safe side.<n> <n><n> <n><n> THE STORY I GAVE IN THE ABOVE SUMMARY DECRIPTION IS DETAILED ENOUGH AND IF NOT CONTACT ME AT THE INFORMATION BELOW.

One craft or three I don&#39;t know.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is an addendum to a report I made approx 16 hours ago concerning a craft of unknown identity spotted in Austin TX. Craft Size: It was between a quarter and half-dollar held at arm&#39;s length. Of course that is an estimation and I cannot give it any weight. I can say that the circle / lights were distanced 1 1/2 circle / light  diameters apart and if linked would from an equilatoral triangle. An imaginary cicle periphery drawn around the three lights would be 2.5 times the size of each light. The craft proceeded north triangle point leading. The lights had depth to them and appeared as shallow domes of light. The effect was something like viewing a tent with a lightsource inside. You don&#39;t see the source but its interaction with the tent material. So too were these lights. They appeared to softly luminesce these shallow domes in a very off orange color. As I mentioned somewhere between subdued peach and burnt ocher. During and immediately after the incident I recorded other visible activity in the sky and this consisted of three other, conventional, aircraft. None interacted with the object and appeared to be normal air traffic. The closest was at least 3-5 kilometers away and the farthest between 8 and 12. Two were generally northeast and one (the farthest) was west. Austin-Bergstrom international airport lies east southeast approx 5 miles away. I hope this comletes this report accurately for you. If I can clarify anything further please let me know. A copy of my initial report is enclosed below. My wife and I were returning to work after a lunch break. I stepped outside and looked up to see the moon. Instead what I saw were three dome shaped lights that were moving north at a constant rate of travel. All three lights were the same color something between a subdued peach &amp; burnt ocher. They did not blink or flash. The lights were either three individual craft moving in perfect triangular formation, or they were attached to one indistinguishable craft. All moved exactly in unison! The craft covered about 40 degrees of sky in less than ten seconds and maintained a constant velocity. No noise accompanied this sighting. I shouted over and over at my wife to &#34;Look at this! Look at this!&#34; She was closing the door behind me and turned and observed the craft for about seven seconds. After continuing across the sky in a straight line the UFO disappeared seemingly winking to nothing as it went into the night. My wife was extrememly shaken. I too felt this, but I also felt excitement. Disbelief. Never have I seen anything even close. I am an Army veteran and am trained in aircraft identification. This was absolutely not a conventional powered aircraft. Nor is it anything I have ever been instructed to watch for. Very chillingly this craft is a near identicle copy of a recreation I observed very recently on TV of a UFO reported all over Britain in one night and investigated by that fromer MOD official whose name I cannot recall. I believe the show was &#34;Sightings&#34;. The event is less that 2 hours old and I am back at work, but my mind is not focused and I feel as though I am running on Auto. What do I do now?<n>

We had the hunting dogs chasing a racoon trail and everything was going fine. Until we looked off to the east i believe and saw a HUGE object entering the earths atmosphere. You could see the steady streak of flames it was leaving behind. At the time it hit the ground there was a very bright White light that filled the whole sky, you could not see your own hand if u held it in front of your face. It made no sound as it crashed to the ground. We really have no idea of what it was until a few days later the local news station said nasa had reported it as space debrie that landed in Austrailia! which i find really hard to believe since the object was so big. This is not even the strange part of the night. As the night continued the hunting dogs that we had takin with us were not responding to a call. These are very expirenced hunting dogs that have worked together for several years. About 30 mintutes later we heard one of the dogs barking about a mile and a half down the road we picked it up with our truck, but the other dog was no where to be found. These dogs have never split up when they are hunting so we found this odd. About 15 min later we finally heard the other dog its bark was very distant from where we were standing. We walked into a field in the general direction we heard the dog. The field was very open and directly infront of us about half a mile down in the field was a bunch of tree&#39;s so we figured the dog mush have a racoon tree&#39;d. We headed off in that direction and when me and my uncle were in the middle of the field a huge round object appeared and was heading directly towards us. My uncle and I at first thought it was a plane and listend for the sound, as it slowly made it almost directly under us. The object had made no sound what so ever it just hovered. There was lights in the middle of the object that were evenly spaced and you could tell it went around the whole spacecraft. I was scared an asked my uncle if it was a plane, and he said no it had way to many lights to be a plane. I got really nervous and was shaking all over my heart was pounding so fast. Then the object went by us and wasnt seen again. After the object had disappered from site we heard the dog barking(again) this time very loud and very near from where we thought it once was. We picked up the dog and left the area immediatly not knowing exactly why the object had appeared or why the dogs were seperated and found about 1 mile away from each other.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

I made eye contact with the object (flying in a northwesterly direction) which had displayed a flashing beacon and looked very typical of the kind of aircraft one might veiw in the night sky. Then my eye was drawn to an other object which was flying below, also in a northwesterly direction(this craft was heading more north than west)however,this object was flying at a great rate of speed and traveling at a much lower altitude. The object looked &#34;completely black&#34; and traveling &#34;without lights&#34;. It seemed to be traveling without sound as well,however,there was noise from the conventional aircraft flying at a much higher altitude above,so maybe the one craft masked the sound of the other. The black craft had a very long &#34;thick&#34; body with two very odd looking short stuby, shark fin like wings attached, however I was viewing the object from the side and it was at a slight angle,so the object could have been triangular.The craft appeared to be ascending!The cloud cover is quite thick tonight (a marine layer) and the black craft almost blended in with the cloud cover. As it passed over I could see patches of cloud mist against the craft&#39;s black body. I would have never noticed it had it not been for the sighting of the first aircraft flying overhead.The black craft looked very out of place and it gave me the distinct impression that it was trying to remain hidden.It looked very ominous and strange.The black craft was about the size of a thumb veiwed in the horizontal position at arms length.I would guess that the object was at about 6000 to 7000 feet,but that&#39;s just a guess(the conventional aircraft was much higher.) My veiw of it was only for a few seconds,then it vanished.I have been watching the night and day sky for years and I  have never seen anything like this!It was very weird!!!<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  The following information was submitted 22NO99 to supplement the first report.))<n> <n><n> <n><n> (clarification) of sighting and reporting of black craft on 11/19/99<n> <n><n> <n><n> The altitude of the craft was hard to estimate.Craft was probably smaller than thumb at arms length!

We always look at the sky and note the constalations and locations of planets and, this morning, commenting on the &#34;bust&#34; of a meteor shower and were hoping to see remenants.  In a moment of silence on the CB radio, I was looking at the night sky with no cloud cover, I scanned from the west to the east when at about 11 o&#39;clock from my vantage point there were two &#34;stars&#34; very bright and very close together at at right to left angle.  These &#34;stars&#34; were so bright I thought I had lost my bearing and was seeing double on  a planet.  Just then, the other driver said, &#34;Do you see what I see ahead?&#34;  I said, &#34;Yeah, they were never there before&#34;  We both were watching them and these very intense lights began to fade.  This was weird because unlike a light bulb going out they faded slowly for a good 5 to 6 seconds into the darkness.  There was no movement and no clouds to dissapear into if this were a plane.  We talked among ourselves and concluded, based on the landing lights of aircraft in the area that these lights were far too bright, too far apart and too motionless to be that of conventional aircraft.  We both decided that I should report this to you.  Thank you.<n>

As it approached, it seemed to form a triangular formation. I remember thinking that it looked like geese, but realized it was a &#34;string&#34; of glowing balls. The balls were golden/white in color, looking like dimmed light bulbs, and the formation appeared to be, perhaps, balloons tied together. My daughter and I figured that&#39;s what it was, catching the reflection of the moon, but as it went over our yard, we realized that balloons could not hold the triangular shape we were seeing. Also, the breeze was coming from the west and this formation was travelling north to south at approximately 25-30 mph. It made no noise whatever. It was very large. I have no way to determine the altitude, as it was dark outside, but I could clearly see that the individual &#34;balls&#34; were round in shape. The formation continued due south and then appeared to veer southwest as we lost sight of it. I called a friend who lived in that direction and asked her to look for it, but she didn&#39;t see anything. We were surprised to not hear anything on the news about it or read about it this morning in the paper. We are both sane females and as we discussed the event, as it was occuring, there is no doubt that we both saw the same thing at the same time.<n>

I swear it&#39;s true.  I just happened to be outside smoking a cigerette and was watching the big passenger liners on thier way to Lindberg field to land. Suddenly what I saw made me think: &#34;Why are the stars moving??&#34;  Four Lights, like stars started to move toward each other; like this: *    -&gt;               &lt;-     * *    -&gt;               &lt;-     * Then they came together:     ** Like this:     ** Next I heard, then saw 2 Jets coming from the north in full afterburners, headed towards them.  Before the jets could get close the 4 stars/UFO&#39;s took off back the way they had come. (they were together for about 5-6 seconds).  Two of the UFO&#39;s went so fast that they were out of sight in just a couple sec&#39;s.  The other two went back to where they had been when I 1st saw them and stoped there - looking like stars again.  When these things stopped they stopped instantly!  Now for some reason unknown to me, the 2 jets went after the 2 UFO&#39;s that kept going, not the ones that had stopped(??)  The entire show happened in just about 20-25 seconds.  I kept watching but nothing else happened so I went inside as it was geting chilly. So, thats it - absolutely true. Unfortunately they were too far away to make out any kind of shape - they just looked like big lights in the night sky!  I was so lucky to look up just at the right time to see them.

After 15 minutes while the object was hidden from my sight behind tall buildings, I saw it again and it was traveling parallel to the earth - tipping a bit northward without losing its llumination. I initially dismissed this incident until I read about the numerous sightings the next day - about a meteor shower in the MID WEST.  I still find it odd that a meteor would be observed in NJ, and a specific meteor would be traveling at a slow speed north-east for 15 minutes - the sighting I saw could have originated off the NJ coastline. which houses numerous military facilities. ilitary s- off the NJ coast near a military installation.before I dismissed it as another object - until I read the numerous accounts of odd sightings in the midwest.  This observance was from Edison, NJ at approximately 7:10=7:15pm.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My husband and I and our 6yr old (and 18 month old) were driving home from my in-laws in Edison to our home in Colonia, NJ. As a passenger in the front seat, I looked out the right front window and saw an odd sight up in the sky.  A traveling, silent light, intense as the North Star ((sic)), was at an equal altitude of the plane traffic in and out of Newark airport, NJ. My husband said I probably just saw a shooting star but I&#39;ve seen a few shooting stars in my lifetime and this was different. My 6yr old in the back right hand seat said it was comet (he didn&#39;t see it initally). For about 3 minutes we passed tall buildings near Metropark train station that blocked this unusual light&#39;s view.  After we passed the tall buildings, I looked up in the sky, not thinking it would still be there (I thought it was also a firework or a comet). However, the sparkling tail heading almost parallel to the earth, tipped a bit northward at the same altitude I originally saw it. My 6 yr old then saw it. My husband was busy driving and just saw one of the many airplanes that were escorting this object. The next evening I went to www.sightings.com,(as I do most every day) and read about all the articles where people in the mid west experienced odd sightings. My husband called me later in the day and said that it was on the news I probably saw a meteor - I can still in my mind see the strange object flying northward - When we arrived in our driveway, I saw about 6 (what looked like airplanes) surrounding this odd illuminated object. ... can a comet fly northward for 15 minutes? Can a shooting star fly northward also? Can a firework continue for 15 minutes without losing illumination or speed?<n>

As I looked there was a craft moving from left to right.  At first,  I thought it must be airliner,  but no vertical stabilizer, then no wings, no engines.  No sound,  no trail.  Figure it was 10 thousand ft altitude,  maybe 5 miles away. Almost a thumb width at arm&#39;s length. The color was that of a titanium golf iron or wood, very polished and seemed to be reflecting the sun.  But the sun was nearly down,  and the craft was not in a position to reflect any sunlight towards me. Craft was moving NE to SW;  climbing at say 20% and accelerated out of sight. I&#39;ve seen a drawing of this craft somewhere,  probably a book.<n>

We saw quite a few meteors, all of which crossed the sky from ne to sw. I said do you see that? That star is moving. She said, yeah, I see it jumping around. I said that&#39;s not a star, I grabbed the binoculars by this time it had moved about 15 to 20 degrees from center sky to the right which was N. Through the binoculars all I could see was a bright star like glowing light moving N. I put the binoculars down and looking back up said where is it? She said, pointing  about another 20 degrees N, it&#39;s right there. And we watched as it moved out of sight. She said it could have been a plane. I said Oh come on, we&#39;ve been lying here watching it, thinking it was a star all this time it wasn&#39;t a plane. Look there&#39;s a meteor. The meteor shot across the sky which appeared to be the same section where the UFO moved from. She said I know but that&#39;s what everybody would say it was. I said Oh, what time is it, looking at my watch, it&#39;s a quarter to 6, I&#39;m calling the UFO hotline because it wasn&#39;t a plane, what kind of plane do we have that could stay in one spot appearing to be a star, then start glowing brighter and moving doing loops looking like it&#39;s moving from one star looping and going to another star looping going straight for a second or two and looping and going out of sight. She said I know, I saw it, it looked like a bee flitting from flower to flower and then moving on. Time 6:00...I said are you believeing that there&#39;s another one. Only this time it moved sw about 20 degrees and disappeared. It is still dark and clear no clouds. Time 6:25...She said look there&#39;s another one. This one was more to the left. It moved about 30 degrees to the left, which appeared to be moving in a straight line. Time 6:30...She got up and pointing to the E she said there&#39;s the brightest star I&#39;ve ever seen. I looked up and to the E, Oh that&#39;s the N star. The sun getting read up come up. I&#39;m still lying watching the the stars in the sky. She came back, and I said well the N star is comming up but these stars are not moving with the rest of the sky. Then I realized these  were satellites or appeared to be satellites since they were not moving. She said that many. There was 6 to 8 scattered across the sky. I had heard about how you could tell which were satellites and which were stars, but this was the first time for me to visually see the satellites. Now the N star is almost over head to the W there are clouds forming. To the E the sun was starting to brighten the sky. It has been a very long time since I have taken the time to lie out under the stars and just watch the sky. It was a very interesting. I&#39;ve always felt UFO&#39;s were out there but now I know for sure. I&#39;VE SEEN ONE! Not up close but they are there! December the 12, 13, or 14, the next know meteor shower, I plan to lie under the stars and again watch the sky from the same spot. Who knows what I might see?<n>

I saw a few bright ones and was about to go back in the house when I noticed movement out of the corner of my left eye (I was facing south).  I saw 7 or 8 luminous circles flying in a V or chevron formation.  They were moving very fast east to west and made no sound.  They covered an area about the size of my thumbnail held at arms length.  The circles were not bright and had they not been moving, I probably would not have seen them.  They were out of sight in about 20 seconds.  Afterwards I wondered if these circles were on the underside of a large delta shaped craft since the allignment was maintained. I am 65 years old and have been interested in astronomy since I was 13.  I have never seen a UFO before.  The local UFON group had no reports that day.  I guess I was just lucky.

However the formation was about 2 1/2 fingers wide, which would have been close for an airplane, but there was no sound. The formation would have passed overhead, but it wasn&#39;t observed until 30 deg from azimuth. Also, it would be unlikely to observe leading edge lights while going away.

As it grew closer I noticed it was triangular in shape.  It made a banking turn and continued north and out of sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am a police officer for a suburb of Columbus, OH.  I had a ride-along passenger, who is a reserve officer for another agency in the area.  We were attempting to find a dark area within the city to observe the Leonid Meteor Shower as it was a slow night.  We had driven back into a railroad yard and stopped the cruiser.  We had been there no longer than five minutes when I noticed an object coming from east to west just west of downtown Columbus.  At first I assumed it was an airplane.  I quickly realized this was not the case.  It appeared similar in shape to an F-117 Stealth Fighter as it approached head-on.  I say this because it seemed to have similar sharp angled features.  After watching it for about 5-10 seconds I told my partner to get out of the car as I was doing the same.  I pointed in it&#39;s direction and said &#34;Do you see that thing?&#34;  He too spotted the object just before it began to make a slow right banking turn.  As it turned, it showed it&#39;s underside completely to us.  It appeared to be an equalateral triangle shape.  There were no flashing lights of any kind on the craft.  It&#39;s underside had some sort of distortion to it almost as if it were camaflouged.  There was absolutely no sound coming from the craft.  It appeared to be relatively close to us and I actually tried to shine my spotlight on it to light it up but it was too far away to be illuminated by it.  We often have the police helicopter fly by as we are close to the heliport and it was much larger in size comparison than the helicopter although it appeared to be at a similar altitude.  After completing it&#39;s turn it leveled off and continued north having just made a 90 degree turn.  It was travelling slowly across the sky; slower than the helicopter would to use it as a comparison again.  It just seemed to glide as a stingray does through the ocean.  It disappeared out of sight to the north of our location.  I called another officer to meet me and we told him about the incident.  He suggested I call Port Columbus Airport.  I end! ed up ca lling the Airport Police and identified myself to them and asked if there was anyway they could find out if the tower had anything unidentified on their radar.  After being on hold for a couple minutes the dispatcher advised me she&#39;d been in touch with Tracon and they had nothing unusual on their radar in the time frame I&#39;d reported.  I cannot say what the craft was but I can say it was like nothing I&#39;ve ever seen and the odd part is that it was completely silent.  I have seen and F-117 fly and I know they are quite loud.  I can also say with 100% certainty it was not any type of meteor.  It was close enough to us that we could distinctly see it&#39;s edges and shape although it was not self illuminated.  I could not say for sure what color it was as it just appeared dark in the sky.  It would have been very easy to miss had we not been looking right at it.  I am truly baffled by what we saw.<n>

Between 1:15 A.M. and 1:20 A.M., I observed 3 pale orange lights in a perfect triangle. At first, I thought they were 3 meteors. I first noticed them just behind Orion&#39;s belt. They were moving at a constant rate of speed due west. They left NO tail. The formation DID NOT change shape in any form. At arm&#39;s length, there was about 1/2 inch between the lights. If they were at extreme altitude, at the speed they were moving, there should have been a sonic boom. At lower altitude, if an airplane, I would have heard the engine sound and didn&#39;t. I watched them for about 15 seconds until they faded from sight just south of the bright star about 40 degrees to the west of Orion. They moved this 40 degree distance in approximately 15 seconds. They were NOT meteors!!<n>

It took about 15 seconds. I didn&#39;t hear any noise. Though it was shaped like a wing (flying wing/boomerang/triangle are ways to describe it), and it was dark grey overall, there were lighter markings as well (lighter grey specks) -- perhaps camoflage paint? (Again, I&#39;m assuming this was a Stealth bomber) I couldn&#39;t judge its distance, but it was about the size, relatively to my perspective, of the three stars in Orion&#39;s belt)<n>

They appeared to interact together for about 10 seconds and then formed into the shape of a triangle for about 3 seconds and then moved swiftly across the sky to the South.

It also was seen to blink out after a couple of minuets.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My friend, my wife and a physician from the local hospital were looking at the Leonids when we saw a hot pink ball of light above the tree tops to the south west rise up and zig-zag across the sky.  We watched for about a minuet or two and it to blinked out of sight in the middle of the sky like the first sighting earlier that evening.  This sighting occurred approximately three hours and some odd minuets after the first sighting which we phoned in.  The difference in this sighting is we had more witnesses this time.  The physician has a good knowledge of the stars and was at a loss for words about the sighting.  It was almost as if he didn&#39;t want to believe what he saw.<n>
11/17/99 23:30|Tucson|AZ|Triangle|1 minute|Sighting of large flying triangle north of Tucson AZ|12/16/99|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/011/S11368.html|105|ndxe199911| Sighting of large flying triangle north of Tucson AZ<n> <n><n> <n><n> On the night of 11/17 I was in Tucson on business. I looked for a spot to watch the meteor shower. I drove up a dark road north of Tucson, in the mountains looking down into the valley. Approx twelve other people were present, including a few students from Univ of Arizona. Sometime after 11 I heard someone say (not shout) &#34;what is that?&#34;. I looked to the east and saw three huge bright lights heading in our direction. As the craft banked, it was clear that it was a solid, triangle-shaped object. As throughout the night you could occasionally see planes flying towards Tucson Int&#39;l Airport, it was easy to get an approximation of the size. It was at least twice the size of a large commercial airline, and probably three times the size. Without a doubt, it is the largest aircraft I have ever seen. As the craft passed by, it made NO SOUND. This was not a trick of the wind as you could hear other planes all night long. Approx five minutes after the craft passed, three military planes passed overhead in loose formation, heading in the general direction (east to west) of the first craft. Five minutes after that, three more jets passed over in a tight formation moving fast and in the exact direction of the original craft. Several people had to plug their ears when the second group of three passed. I am an executive level individual, which I only tell you to hopefully help validate what this report states. If I were asked, I would think that what I saw was a large military transport of some sort. I know the size is accurate since there was plenty to which to make comparisons. It was the only aircraft to emit no noise that night. It made a graceful arc in front of our location, so the shape was easy to see. I would judge the speed as similar to a jumbo jet while landing (ie it seems they are going slower than they really are). I had a hard time finding this report format, so this is a bit dated. If someone would like additional info, it is ok to call or e-mail me. Anyone who states these craft do not exist does not know what he or she is talking about. I am not saying it was aliens or anything like that, but the craft is there. Thank you.<n>

Appears to be surrounded by a haze, could not definitely say the shape but looking through with binoculars it appeared to be cylindrical.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Wednesday, November 17, 1999 My sister and I were looking out the window to see we if could see the meteor showers. Living across the Hudson River in NJ from NYC we knew our chances our were slim since NYC is so lit up.  But for about an hour we are watched this light in the sky above NYC.  It flashed colors of bright blue to green to yellow to red and then repeated itself.  I have been to Pine Bush, NY and a few times we thought we saw something when we realized it was a star affected by the atmosphere.  But this was different.  I focused on larger stars and the atmosphere was not affecting them like this one. It was not moving towards or away from the horizon.  It moved slightly north to south and was, and I am guessing at this, about 3 miles above the skyline.  Planes landing at NYC airports were below it. We tried to focus with bincolars but it was too far away to get any definite shape but it appeared to be cylindrical.  We watched this for approximately an hour. The next two nights we looked for it again but did not see it.  The planet Venus? and the moon were visable.<n>

The whole object was consumed in this hot pink light. We viewed the hot pink light as it zig-zaged across the sky making sharp patterns and turning back in on itself.  It would accelerate up and down as well.  ((name deleted)) went to get his binoculars out of the car while I kept an eye on the object.  While he was getting the binoculars it just blinked out.  While on the phone with Mr. Davenport we thought we saw what was another UFO in the south east but determined that it was only a star after closer observation. There was no way that the first object we saw was a star or a conventional aircraft. Of that we are both absolutely sure. Since Mr. Davenport was on the phone when we saw the star we thought it necessary to include it in the report and let him know that we were in error.  Having said that we end this report.<n>

We had planned to drive out to the eastern Plains in a few hours to catch the peak of the Leonid meteor shower and wanted to get the scope ready to examine Saturn while in the darkness of the countryside. My husband was actually looking through the scope and my mother and I were standing up looking at the planet unaided when I saw movement in the sky just below and to the right of Jupiter. I looked and saw what appeared to be a very large, irregularly shaped &#34;object&#34; moving at an accelerated rate through the sky. Now when I say I saw it, I&#39;m not sure that entirely describes how I witnessed it. This thing, whatever it was, was camouflaged exquisetely. To be perfectly honest, I don&#39;t know how it even caught my attention in the first place. It almost appeared to be a piece of the night sky itself. Immedeatly, I started screaming and pointing at the object as it glided silently almost entirely undetectable. I was screaming &#34;Oh my God, look! Look! Look! It&#39;s f---ing huge! What the f--- is that?&#34; My mother spotted it a half second later and began screaming as well. When my husband saw it he began saying it might be a military aircraft and to watch closely as it passed by the stars that were in it&#39;s path. The military theory was quickly extinguished when we saw light from the stars behind it pass through revealing that it was actually transluscent. We began to run to keep it in our sights but then lost it in the glare of streetlights. We were unable to re-establish visual contact with the phenomenon. We returned to the house and scrambled to call Buckley Air National Guard. The individual there procceded to remind us of the meteor shower and offered the number of the Denver Airfield. The person there was equally apathetic and offered us the number of NUFORC. All three of us  then drew pictures of the object independently without disscussing the details and ! came up with three remarkably similar shapes. The shape, like I&#39;ve stated before, was an oddly irregular boomerang shape. I say boomerang for loss of any other descriptive word, for the object lacked the symmetry associated with a boomerang yet retained a decidedly boomerang shape. It appeared to be a slightly different texture than the sky which is probably the only reason it was visible at all. It&#39;s speed and apparent size were also immense.<n>

I have no history of mental illness and no criminal history.  I was driving east in SW Fort Worth on Old Grandbury Road and almost to the intersection of Hulen when I looked in front of me in the sky slightly south and noticed a cylinder shaped silver object.  I thought it was a plane but all of a sudden it disappeared before my eyes.  I looked all around in the sky but it was gone.  A second later a small plane flew in the same area with a contrail behind it.  My sister and I had a extrodinary sighting 25 years ago and for some reason we never reported it or told very many people about it and in fact forgot about it almost instantly until about 5 years ago.  This time I want to make sure it is reported and if it was a plane thats fine but still I have very large doubts since it was gone in an instant.  Can you please let me know if anyone else saw anything odd today?<n>

Both the receiver and I were outside,(trailers are put on a large scale platform, and titled into the air, to empty out the product into a conveyor/hopper), Both the man that worked for the receiver and I were looking up @ the nose of the trailer, up in the air, when I noticed a dim light, slowly brighten ,,to a very bright light(like a reostat, landing light brightness), I turned to the the reciever and said, did you see that?, and he replied, &#34;that&#39;s what I&#39;m lookin&#39; at&#34;. We both watched as this light SLOWLY,(reostat action again), dimmed to black/nothing.We looked @ each other,,and both commented on the &#34;oddness&#34; of what we both saw. @ this time it started to appear again,in the slow, reostat increase, IN THE SAME SPOT, and stayed the steady, landing light type brightness, and then gradually faded to black. We looked @ each other again, and &#34;Jim&#34; said that this was to strange. We both could clearly see the stars, and there was no running lights of any kind(and we are located just south of an airport, requiring the use of these). I travel the southwestern US in my job,,and have seen several questionable things in the night sky, most of which I have always attributed to meteors or comets, this series of light were neither, to the best of my judgement. There was no aircraft noise in the area, no running lights were seen, and no contrail/ tails were seen preceeding what we had witnessed. We both agreed what we had seen was out of the ordinary. After we waited/looked for awhile, &#34;jim&#34; said &#34; musta been a lost UFO, turned on his cab light to see his mapbook&#34;, we both chuckled, and i mentioned that this was one for The Art Bell show(which I had just finished listening to you both on).<n> <n><n> <n><n> Bright, white lights, fading in, and out of intensity,,of landing light intensity.<n>

All three objects moved together at the same time,and moved up and down,and east to west and back.we observed all three objects for atleast 2 hrs. then we returned to the house to notify others that witnessed the closest object,after a few minutes,I myself returned to the woods behind the property, and from that point on cannot remember anything!!! I wokeup in my friends house the next morning and no one could explain how I got inside the house ,allentrances were locked and secured and no signs of entry were to be found !!!!!! I have no keys or anyway of entering their house without someone letting me in.....all three objects were bright white with occasional flash&#39;es of red and green on the outer perimeter of each object,and all three even though very far apart moved together in unison!!!!!These objects were observed on a totally clear night with no visible moon or ground lights!!!!This incident was witnessed on top of a small hill with almost no ground obstrutions except for a few trees!!!!!In other words a unobsructed view of the sky!!!!!<n> <n><n> <n><n> At 2:35am. Myself and my bestfriends son were trying to watch the southeastern skies,in the backwoods property behind my friends property.We had already been outside watching for meteorites, starting at 2:00am.At 2:35am. We both noticed an object ,a very bright object rise above the southeastern woods!!!The object was hovering yet moving side to side and moving in very deliberate movements...Behind the first object but off to the left, yet very far in the distance was the second object,it was definately moving like a mirror image of the first..After aprox. twenty minutes off to the northeastern sky a third moving bright object dropped into view and almost seemed to line itself up with the other two objects. Once it lined up with the other two ,all three started to move in unison,first north to south then up and down this pattern of movements continued for atleast one and a half hours!!!!!! After awhile we went back to my friends house and woke up the parents of my 16yrold companion.They both observed the first object from their backporch for about 5 mins. At that point the parents and the 16yr. old went back into the house. I returned to the backwoods to resume watching the three objects. From that point on,I walked farther into the woods and observed the first object coming closer to me!! F rom that point on I donot remember anything more!!!!!!!! In the morning I awoke aprox. 10:00am. upstairs in a house that was locked and no one recalls either hearing me enter the house or letting me in!!!!!!The lady of the house seen me upstairs laying down completely clothed and still wearing my wool hat,and shaking,but still asleep she did not wake me at that time but expressed astonishment,later that I had gotten inside the house with absolutely no one hearing me enter or anyone letting me in the house I have no key to their house and the only other entrance is a very noisy sliding door that was shut and secured!! I know that we could&#39;nt have been the only one&#39;s to have seen this but no one else has admitted to ! such!!!! !!<n>

It did not seem to move at all, just to hang in the same position.

The shower had not been very strong until approximately 02:00 in our area,  the cloud cover was minimal, and I was able to identify many constellations, paying particular attention to the East where the news reports said to look for the shower to develope.  Very clearly on the East horizon there appeared a very high and extremely bright orange light surrounded by a hazy triangular or slightly arrowhead shape that crossed slowly across the sky directly overhead.  I&#39;ve seen the shuttle re-entry overhead at night when told to look for it and it was similar in approximate altitude/size/shape but not in color.  The shuttle appeared pinkish.  The object simply SLOWLY crossed overhead horizon to horizon EAST TO WEST DIRECTLY OVERHEAD.  It took approximately 30 seconds. THE REST OF THE EVENTS THAT NIGHT WERE IN NO WAY SIMILAR.  I observed scores if not hundreds of extemely fast moving white and yellowish/white streaks moving almost entirely in the opposite direction, West to East.  These seemed to be the typical meteroites that I have observed for years.<n>

The thing is I&#39;ve seen thousands of shooting stars in my life and never have I seen two together moving slowly, then speed up, move together and turn together at an extremely hard right. It happened so fast and then it was gone, I wish it would have lasted longer or I could see it again.<n>

We noticed a cluster of lights in the sky that looked abnormal.  During a period of approximately two hours we watched this &#34;cluster&#34; move around in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A group of at least six lights caught our attention because of their spacing.  They were very close together but initially appeared to be a star constellation.  After close observation we noticed that the lights were moving.  They would move one direction than another direction.  Their movement was very erratic at certain times.  They appeared to be traveling in unison.  Occasionally other lights would shoot out from the area of the lights.  This light would streak across the sky very faintly similar to the meteors but much fainter.  It was hard to distinguish if the six lights were one object or six different objects.  Occasionally the six lights would move so fast it would leave a streak or tail.  The object&#39;s shape was like a kite with a tail plus one extra light in the middle that was brighter than the others.<n>

I was traveling South on I-35 at the time, I was just a few miles South West of the State Capitol buildings.  Not a big deal, but it was the first time I had seen a fire ball of this size and type.<n>

At first I thought it was a comet or meteor, even a plane crashing. I called to my roommate to come outside and look. She thought it might be a flock of geese. Then we got a good look at it, but we both saw it differently. I saw a boomerang shaped obect, the struture glowing orange with two round white lights at the tip of each end and no light at the front. She saw it as a series of orange lights defining the shape as a boomerang. She did not see the white lights. The first time we saw it, it was very high in the sky, it came from the south and flew east. When I first saw it, it was moving very slowly, then it darted behind trees to the east. We both lost sight of it. Then it reappeared maybe 1-3 minutes later.  We don&#39;t know for sure what direction it came from the second time, it was just there. It appeared to be closer and larger the second time. It also appeared to be going back in the same direction it came from. We dont remember what happened to it, where it went the second time, it seemed to dissappear, but it could have been obscured by the light haze in the distance.  After we lost sight of it, a flock of geese did fly by and we could compare the object and its movemnet to the geese. It was definately not geese! We did not hear any sound either time. We are both students at the University of Missouri, Columbia. (Uploaded by investigator)<n>

They remained there for quite some time and then sped off.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I saw 4 craft at around 11:15 p.m. last night floating in the sky around the Big Dipper. They floated about rather slowly in circular patterns and one sped off almost immediately after I first saw them. The other three remained for nearly five hours and didn&#39;t really do much except float around. They remained in motion constantly (not much motion, but it was noticeable) all the time I watched. The craft themselves appeared to be rectangular or oval in shape and didn&#39;t appear to have three dimensions at all (i.e., flat or something?). They were primarily yellow, green and red in color, with two yellow bands (apparently glowing) on their &#34;top&#34; and &#34;bottom,&#34; running all the way across, from &#34;front&#34; to &#34;back&#34; on all four of them. In between the two yellow bands was a section of alternating red and green lights that appeared to either move or change colors in a regular pattern. I am a 19 year old student with an interest in the sciences (primarily physics and astronomy). I don&#39;t really know what other information about me you want -- I&#39;m not a &#34;wacko&#34; or mentally unstable or anything. Also: this isn&#39;t the first time I have seen these craft, either. I see them usually a few times a year, but never this many and never for this long, so I decided this was noteworthy. Thank you for your time.<n>

Noticed a group of lights, very faint, in the shape of a huge boomerang, possibly a delta shape. It was a perfectly clear night, in a location where light pollution is relativly low. I told my wife and best friend about this sighting, they noticed that I was spooked, but didn&#39;t have interest. They accompanied me soon after, only because they wanted to see the meteor shower. My friend @ 0:34 saw the exact same object in the exact same line of path where I witnessed it for a second time. The line of path was North to South. It took approx. 5 sec to cross 70 degrees of sky, and I guess it was approx. 40K to 75K ft. in alt. (guessing 2-3 times an airliners).

The tail would grow to about the length of my thumb and then recede back into the star. The effect almost looked similar to that of say, a jet afterburner being turned on and then off. The object appeared to be about the same height as aircraft flying, I would guess around 30,000 feet? However, it did not appear as though it was a star. It made no sound or noise and was stationary during this time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I watched the object and this tail grow and then shrink slowly (maybe the process of its tail going back into it took about 30 seconds, hard to recall). for about 20 minutes. I then checked into a nearby hotel, the Hampton Inn, and told the woman at the front desk about what was outside. She said people sometimes see weird things all the time and followed me out into the parking lot. When she looked up, she saw the object as well and remarked that it appeared to be changing colors, red, orange, and I believe yellow.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After that I decided to take my 35mm camera and drive west on I-180, back towards the desert and away from any lights, to take some photos of the object. I wanted to be sure that I captured it as best as possible so I took the photos with the aperture left open for around 30 seconds. Unfortunately I did not have a tripod when taking the photos and tried to position it on the ground braced against my jacket. Some of the photos, it is apparent that there is movement from the camera itself. Other photos clearly show the “tail” in question. After taking photos for roughly 15 minutes and beginning to get creeped out (I was in the middle of the desert and it was probably 12:30 or 1:00am) I saw a plane begin to approach the vicinity of the object. At this point, the object started to move in I think was an S type pattern. After that I was too freaked out to stay out “alone” in the desert and headed back towards town and the comfort of my hotel room.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A few days later I arrived in Los Angeles (my destination), and had the photos developed at a 1 hour photo lab. I specified that the negatives not be cut so that they could be scanned at some point. Feel free to contact me if you have any questions and I’ll do my best to recall any other info.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

A few more seconds passed when I stopped my truck and got out to watch and noticed I could hear the crackling and rumbling sound of fire.  It was a HUGE meteor burning up in our atmosphere and I thought I was witnessing the end of the Earth.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I watched as parts of it broke off and fell into the tail.  As each piece joined the tail they hit the next one knocking it farther back.

The fact that I could hear it meant it couldn&#39;t have been too far away. I estimate within 100 miles because it was inside our atmosphere. For something to appear visually to be six inches high at 100 miles I estimate it would have to be at least as big as the island of Cuba. I feel honored to have witnessed it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date is approximate.  PD))<n>

As it glided to the south east I lost site of it because it then blended into the night sky.  It flew in a straight line, no noise, and no lights on it.  My husband told me to explain to him how large it was in proportion to the Moon.  The Moon at the time was half full, I invisioned it to be full, and told him the span of the wings were twice the span of the Moon.  I saw a Stealth Bomber fly over the Indy 500...It reminded me a bit of that.  This though, from my vantage point was shaped more like a boomerang, and very-very large.

I was amazed of the brightness of the object since I had never seen any meteorite like it before. It was at approxitmatly 45 deg. when I first noticed it going in a due east direction. The object was a very bright green. It &#34;appeared&#34; to be at 3000 feet altitude so I turned around the block expecting to see it hit the ground. As I was going in the opposte direction it fragmented into maybe 6 or 7 smaller pieces. It fizzled out behind a 40-story building as I was about 3/4 miles from that building. Fort Wayne doesn&#39;t have many tall buildings so I had a clear view of the object until it ended. I&#39;m not sure if it made a noise or not when it passed. Duration of time visually was between 1-2 min. I&#39;m sure there was others who saw it since I was driving on a 4 lane(one way) street in middle of town.I work as a Maintenance Technician at a Country Club and see things as they are but this is uexplainable to me.<n>

But I realized it was moving because it was getting closer.  It wasn&#39;t so bright anymore and it kept moving inch by inch, and eventually moving pretty fast.  As it flew over me I knew it was a UFO because it looked like triangle with straight sides and it was 3-dimensional.  I was amazed that i couldn&#39;t move.  It felt like it was moving in slow motion.  I could hear my heart beating and as the object kept moving I seen three lights one at each corner.  I still couldn&#39;t move I was so moved by this object.  And eventually when the object was out of sight i caught my breath and slowly stood up as if i was frozen and wen&#39;t inside telling my sister what i saw but she doesn&#39;t belive me.<n>

C.S.T., and I knew the exact time because I had checked my watch. The sun had been set about 2 hours, and because a cold front had passed through the area a few days before, the sky was extremely clear. While I was waiting for the dog , I just looked up into the clear night sky to stargaze on this unusually clear night. Toward the East I saw what I naturally assumed to bea flock of birds in a V formation. They were moving relatively quickly, silently, and elegantly from East to West, then after a 15 seconds  or so, headed Southeast. I noticed no significant sounds nor any flapping ofwings, and their color was brownish, and individually each more all winged shaped. I found this weird because I&#39;ve never known birds to flock orfly in a V formation well after sunset and so silently. I only told a few close friends and my wife of this event, and only after I saw it reoported on this site, did i finally decide to report it myself.<n>

I said to my wife and kids, &#34;Look at the size of that airplane&#34;. It was very large and seemed to be a triangle shape. I realized it was moving much to slow to be an airplane. The night sky is very clear here and I could see the size of it by how much of the stars it was blocking out as it moved southward. It was in my estimate the width of about 3 football fields and had 3 very bright lights that were white. One light was on each corner of the craft. It appeared to be of a triangualr shape. My son asked me why we couldn&#39;t hear it and I realized that as close as it was, we should have been able to hear it. There was no sound. Very rarely do we see aircraft in the sky over San Manuel and when we do, they are at a very high altitude. This craft was at approx. 5000 feet and about 1 mile to the west of where we were sitting. Suddenly, the craft turned to the west and either disappeared or turned off its lights.<n>

I thought it was the landing lights of an airplane approaching Columbus Airport until it began to separate into two perhaps three distinct pieces with smaller debris all seeming to stay in the same flight path (as the tail of a comet). I assumed it to be a meterior as the season was correct for meterior showers, but the time was too early being 19:30 hours.<n>

My wife yelled at me and said what the heck are those things in the sky. It was eerie. At first I thought it was incoming rockets, or meteors. But they were in some sort of formation, equidistant from ech other. When one slowed up they all did, when the leader faded, they all did.<n>

The colors consisted of bright white, and followed with red, orange and blue lights. My family ran out on our deck to watch in amazement as the object traveled North East. Right away we called another family member who lived in the direction it was going. Soon after he had called us back also in amazement because he had saw the same thing. I then decided to call the sheriff department to report it. At the time that i called there had already been 400 sightings.<n>

Broke up into 4 pieces.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Approx. 7:00-7:15pm Tuesday evening I was driving west on West Chester road, (about 12 miles north of downtown Cincinnati, OH) when I noticed a Bright white fireball in the western sky. Knowing that the Leonid showers where near I thought &#34;Wow, this could mean they are starting early and should be very good tonight&#34;but quickly realized that the Leonids would be from the East, not the West. It quickly turned bright green and grew to the size of about 1/2 thumbnail at arms length. An orange tail stretched out behind the fireball to a length of approx. 1 1/2 to 2 fists when held at arms length. It arched across the night sky in front of me from the left of my windshield to my right passenger window and appeared to break into 4 large pieces, (now yellow) and drop behind the trees to my right. It appeared very low in the sky and most remarkably, it seemed to move in slow motion for a metiorite. To illustrate just how long it was in the sky, about 1/2 way through its flight, I had time to slow the car down and remove my seat belt to watch it. Just then I saw the headlights of another car approaching from the other direction and since this was a winding country road, I thought I had better pay more attention to my driving and proceeded to drive past this approaching car and when I pulled off the road to see if I could still see the tail, I was shocked to see it still traveling above the tree line over my right shoulder.                            I am a photographer, 41 years old, 20-10 vision, and have watched the Persius metiorite shower every year for the last 18 years from a beach in North Carolina. I have seen metiorites impact in the ocean and have seen them so close that my wife and I could hear them breaking up. None have ever lasted for more than a few seconds. This reminded me of the film of the re-entry of the U.S. space station over Australia many years ago. This was the most impressive event I have ever seen. Most of the city saw the object and the radio, (700 WLW) talked about it for the rest of! the nig ht. Reports included the 5 air traffic controllers at Greater Cincinnati Airport saying that they were &#34;frozen&#34; by the sight of this and that they had never seen anything like it in their 15 years in the tower. When asked if it appeared on radar one replied, (sic) No, I think it was was too fast for the radar to pick up, but when pressed he replied that he was too busy watching it out the window to look at the radar scope. I wonder if they will review the tapes. Tim Headrick, the weatherman on our Chanel 12 WKRC-TV said that he also saw the object and it appeared to him to be at least the size of a semi tractor-trailer. He commented that it could be one of three things; 1) Leonid metiorite shower 2) Re-entering &#34;Space Junk&#34; 3) &#34;Something else&#34; infering a UFO You might like to talk to him.<n>

I was traveling in the Chicago area and looking for my hotel around 7PM EST. I had just turned onto a side road in the Downers Grove/Oak Brook area that runs east along the main expressway into Chicago.  Further east toward the Chicago skyline and in the center of the sky I saw what looked like a bright green fireball following by a trail of red.  There seemed to be several red balls in the tail.  The bright green object was at least 1/3 of the total length of the object.  The objects moved together train-like and didn&#39;t seem to change distance.  It moved northeast across the sky.  I pulled off the road and watched for about 15 seconds before it disappeared to the north of the Chicago skyline. Earlier that day, I had seen a plane pulling a banner around Chicago.  Thinking about it, I wondered if perhaps it wasn&#39;t the same plane lit up at night.  A week or two later, I mentioned it to somebody else who said they had heard a similar story on the news.<n>

I also reported it to you. And their was a note that said you wanted to contact anyone whom had seen it. Again, I was walking my dog, was facing south, and over my left shoulder caught a bright object. I turned and saw 4 very distinct egg shaped objects, equidistance to each other, travelling due east at an extremely high velocity. From the point I saw them they were at about 11:30 and were out of line sight about 3 sec. I have spent many nights watching the perseiddes and other showers, let me tell ya, this was&#39;nt no meteor. They glowed a yellow orange and made no sound...I was awestruck.

The lights were horizontal when we first saw them. I held my hand at arm&#39;s length and opened my hand as far as I could.  Then I held my hand up to the lights and they spanned longer than the distance between the tips of my thumb and index finger.  It passed over my subdivision as it continued in it&#39;s path. It took approximately 10 seconds for it to travel from one end of my subdivision to the other (about one mile), but the lights spanned over at least 1/4 of that mile.)  It was very long. We heard no noise, but it was traveling at a low altitude -- lower than the airplanes fly over the subdivision as they ready to come in for a landing. We could not make out a form of the object it could have been cigar shaped or disc shaped (assuming that the lights were positioned on the outside edge of the object.)  As it moved, it passed behind some clouds and then reappeared.  Then the string began to slowly aim downward at approximately a 45 degree angle to the earth.  It continued downward and I could guestimate that if it were to hit the earth, it would hit somewhere in Flint, which is 10 miles NE of Swartz Creek. At that point, we could no longer see it. (I was expecitng to see it either ascend and reappear or to see some flash or something to indicate that it crashed).  We did not see it again.    I felt that the object was at least 5 miles away when it began to tilt downward. The distance between each light remained constant throughout the sighting. Fint&#39;s Bishop airport is about 4 miles from Swartz Creek.  There were no planes near the object at the time, but I could see about 4 planes much higher in the sky and much further away.  I have lived here for 35 years and what I saw was in no way an airplane.<n>

The object(s) were travelling at a speed much slower than I am used to seeing a meteor travel at. My first impression was that an aircraft was on fire. The object seemed to be directly overhead and took about 15 seconds to cover my field of view. This is my third encounter of this type. If you check on Alta Vista for &#34;Harwood Ontario&#34; you might find some material on my first sighting some years ago.This one was a day-time sighting and left a noticeable smoke trail. The other sighting was about two years ago in Hamilton and looked almost identical to last nights, although slightly smaller. To the best of my knowledge they were both thought to be &#34;re-entering space junk&#34;. Having had fifteen seconds to observe this last sighting, I am leaning towards the &#34;space junk&#34; theory. Not to denegrate anyones theories on UFOs , but this object last night was most definitely some sort of fire-ball. Looking at a map of N.A. it would appear that this object would have gone over Central Mich., S. Ontario, N. NY, Vermont, Maine Nova Scotia and S. Newfoundland.<n>

It went from horizon to horizon traveling from west to east - the exact opposite direction from which the anticipated Leonid Meteor Shower was to occur. I did not actually time it, but I believe that it was visible between a minute and a half and two minutes--long enough for me to study it as it traversed the sky. As the fireball crossed the sky, it gave off several very bright colors that appeared to be a metallic disintegration or burning. It was glowing predominantly white on the leading edge with blue just behind the white. In my mind, the blue indicated that a copper compound or copper substance was involved. There was some red and yellow as well, and as I observed it, I could clearly see chunks coming off it and burning up in the same manner as the main fireball. It left a smoke trail, but I did not hear a sonic boom as I expected that I might. My first thought was that I was witnessing the reentry of the MIR space station, or something similar in nature. It did NOT appear to be an intelligently controlled craft--unless it was a craft in great distress. It would be difficult to say exactly what I saw.  However, I do know that what I saw was NOT a meteor, and clearly NOT associated with the anticipated Leonid Meteor Shower. I have been watching meteor showers for over forty years now and I know exactly what a meteor looks like.  I am appalled that the news media was so quick to report that this event was part of the anticipated Leonid Meteor Shower.  That was clearly NOT what I witnessed. I have been a pilot since I was in my teens and spent four years as an air traffic controller for the FAA.  I am also an amateur astronomer and I feel very comfortable about recognizing and identifying anything that appears in the sky.<n>

At 7:10 p.m. I witnessed several (5-7) bright amber colored lights traveling in an easterly direction.  The lights were in a straight formation.  At first I thought they were lights on a new antenna or something until I realized they were moving.  The lights were bright, they sparkled (not blinking like a plane) and they each appeared to have a small tail.  They did not appear to be too far away, although I guess the distance could be deceiving. I stopped my vehicle right on the road and watched them for about 10 to 20 seconds.  During that time they traveled about a quarter of the way across the sky from west to east.  They remained in a straight line at the same distance apart the whole time.  I did not hear anything, although my windows were up.  Another car approached from behind so I turned onto the next road, hoping to see them again, but never did. I know what a meteor looks like, and this was not one. I thought it may be a plane on fire, but nothing like that was reported. It could have been space debris? Afterwards, I drove back to the original spot looking for some explanation (house lights, spot lights, reflections, etc) but found nothing that could explain it. I thought I was crazy until a friend at work told me that a friend of his had seen similar lights on the same night.  Then I searched the Internet and found similar reports from the same night.<n>

They seemed to be going relatively at the speed of  normal aircraft crossing traffic. They went by us on the left and we lost site of them as they moved to our 7:30 position. We had those  lights in sight for about 20 seconds. While we we observing the phenomena we heard Lufthansa flight 470 report the sighting to Toronto air traffic control center. Their aircraft was about 5 miles to the right of us at 35000 ft. also going westbound as they reported seeing the lights to the left at roughly their altitude. ATC responded that there was nothing special on there radar. While we still had the lights in sight, we also reported the sighting to air traffic control and shortly after another aircraft in the area did the same but we did not note its flight number. It was a very spectacular sight and something that we had never experienced before. We were speculating at the time that it might be a satellite or space debris coming crashing down in the atmosphere.<n>

When I immediately looked out I saw almost out of nowhere were these balls of light with tails flying totally in a straight line.  I&#39;ve never seen anything like it.  I proceded to call the St. Clair Shores police dept. to ask if anyone else had seen what I saw.  They said they didn&#39;t have any other reports.  I then called my mom, two girlfriends(that I didn&#39;t get ahold of) and my fiance and described what I saw.  I was then informed about the metior showers but it didn&#39;t look like that to me.  It was going west to east horizontally in a line, not vertically.  My mom then heard the program on the radio and called me to tell me other people saw exactly what I saw and they were describing it on the radio.  I live in Southeast lower Michigan and someone said at 19:04 someone reported it in Northern Michigan. I also called our local T.V. station to report what I saw after hearing the radio broadcast.<n>

The object was first seen in the left side of our field of vision, first it was dismissed as glare, or a row of houses, because it wasn&#39;t moving. Then the object proceeded to cross our field of vision moving from north to the southeast. It appeared to be a large airplane, traveling close to the ground and close to us, it almost appeared to be a crashing airliner. The only problem with it being a plane was the absence of sound, nothing could be heard except the wind and passing cars. If a big airliner was to pass that close, you would definately hear it. The driver of the car and I discussed the fact that it looked almost like two or three airplanes following close behind each other,or as if they were connected, fusealage to tail. There appeared to be lights on the craft, with a higher concentration near what is assumed to be the front of the craft, than to the rear of the craft. Since the sight looked so much like a crashing plane, we kept waiting to see an explosion, while keeping a lookout for a landing sight, or some other sign of landing. Once the craft passed out of out field of vision, it was not seen again by us, even though there was ample opportunity to see the skyline in which it departed, once the trees cleared. The color of the craft is undetermined, as to the fact it was dark outside, but the craft appeared to be darker than the night sky, as if it were black, or some other dark color.<n>

(I was talking to my boyfriend on my cell phone as well.) I saw 5 balls of light total, 2-3 much brighter than an average falling star. I&#39;d say that in comparison to the brightest star in the sky, the size was perhaps 4 to 5 times larger as well as brighter. They were moving VERY slow, almost hovering. All 5 were very close together and they never strayed from each other. I kept saying &#34;Wow! wow! wow!&#34; to my boyfriend the whole time, thinking that I was witnessing a meteor shower (I&#39;ve never seen one before). They didn&#39;t seem to fade away until about 25-30 later. They were yellow in color with no tail. I kept looking up in the sky after that, but I didn&#39;t see anything. I normally wouldn&#39;t be writing in to report this, but after talking with another witness, he said it would be beneficial to you if I report what I saw. I&#39;m not a sceptic of UFOs, nor am I a believer. I DO, however, have an open mind about things. And the fact that there is a REMOTE chance that this may be something other than falling debris from space (as stated in a Detroit newspaper the next day) compelled me to write to you today. I hope that this helps in your studies.<n>

I was south of it facing north from 10:00 position in sky traveling to 2:00 position looking up at it at about a 70-75 degree angle.  As it traveled, hundreds of yellow-white sparks flew away from it leaving a trail.  The center of the object was green and red flames and made no sound. The center object was rapidly diminishing, burning up. All of the white sparks burned out so nothing hit the ground. It was quite small with one or two sparks flying off of it when it disappeared out of sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It caught my eye thorough the windshield as I was driving home on my street.  It was dark and there were many plane lights in the air(we live near an airport).  I&#39;m sure it was seen by some of those planes although it appeared to me to be at an altitude between the ground and the planes so they would have had to look down to see it.  It looked like a firework display that moved across the sky.  I pulled into my driveway as it passed by. I was alone and saw no one else in the neighborhood.

It changed colors as it passed from Vanilla White to a sky blue. It made a slight whistling sound. It continued to travel; didn&#39;t fall to the ground. It was already dark here, so the color change was clearly visible. I have never seen anything like it in my life.<n>

About 10 objects of varying sizes travelling about the appearent speed of vehicles on a highway  about a mile away at 90 deg to my line of sight. Roughly 30 deg. in elev. from horiz they appeared at first like cars going over an overpass with headlights shining on the guardrail. I watched for about 20 sec. as the objects, travelling horizontally, finally dimmed and went out roughly together. The largest of the objects were obviously still intact when they cooled and would have landed. As distance was difficult to judge from one position its hard to determine rough location but from my perspective they were heading in the direction of eastern Lake Ontario My questions are:1, Would they have been leonids travelling from west to east? 2, Would they have been leonids being that big? 3, Could it have been an opertune reentering of terrestrial hardware 4, Did I report this to the proper authorities &amp; if not, please advise. Also please reply.     Very respectfully    ((name deleted))<n>

I was out doors when I caught sight of the object for about 10 seconds, about 20-30 degrees above the horizon when it was northwest of my position, and it was moving in a generally southwest to northeast direction.  It was very obviously far away, fast moving, and high in the atmosphere.  Just from my own perception and from it&#39;s rate of travel and straight path, it was obvious to me that the object was very massive and huge, MOUNTAIN-scale.  It was travelling in an inertial straight line skimming the atmosphere, leaving a fire trail and sparks behind as it went.  I would definitely qualify it as almost an asteroidal near miss event.  It was far enough up that it was seen throughout northeast USA.  There was videotape of it shown on local television.<n>

We had been deer hunting all day and were discussing the day&#39;s events when I caught a light out of the corner of my eye. The picture window in the living room was directly to my back and I looked up and saw this orangish (extremely bright!) object followed by several other smaller but similar objects streaking across the sky from southwest to northeast in direction. I yelled at my friend to &#34;look, look now, hurry!, he jumped out of his chair and looked out the window and saw the last 2-3 seconds of it. Through the window I would guess that I had a view of approximately 20% of the sky and I saw the object for 8-10 seconds.  I know you have a lot of reports on this but thought you might like another. The time and date are specific as I checked the clock immediately.  I am an avid meteor watcher.  I try to observe all the meteor showers and was going to go out later that night to try to see some that were expected but did not plan on seeing anything like this. The meteor shower for the 17th was a total dud in this area except for this fireball which I do not believe was related at all.  I have seen many shooting stars, some quite amazing and none of them begin to match this one size, brightness or duration!<n>

I was leaving my parents&#39; home at about 19:08 when I saw what appeared to be a meteor or space junk re-entry. There was a large object with a thin white to red to blue trail following. When I first saw it I was facing NNE and the object was traveling left to right, just to the right of my center of vision at about 30 to 40 degrees elevation. The object travelled in a north-easterly direction and broke up into about 4 pieces that stayed along the same path as all of them faded into darkness. I heard all of the hullabaloo on WLW AM 700 in Cincinnati and later on the Art Bell show on AM 1100 from Cleveland and I was kind of surprised. Yes the object was large and it headed in the opposite direction of where you would expect a leonid meteor to come from, but it didn&#39;t exhibit any non-ballistic or unexplainable motion. I have been interestested in UFO&#39;s and astronomy since I was very young and I have seen many more spectacular meteor events than the one on 11/16/99. I am sure that it was a meteor.<n>

North, East of Detroit Metro. Wayne Co. Air port.) My family and I had just finished dinner clean-up when I walked into our &#34;Great Room&#34; to hear something my son was telling me. While listening to him I saw a bright  flameing object enter my field of view through the tri-angle shaped clearstory windows flanking our fireplace. I immediately (triping over my son) lept to the window in about 5 strides. Where I saw it passing west to east through the view of the tri-angluar window. I then ran to the east side of the room to a doorwall that had partially opend curtins where I saw it disapear. My son was confused, at first at why I was running around the room while and claming a plane is crashing, untill he saw what I was talking about. Then  I went to get gas and two guys pulled up next to me and asked if I saw the comet? I went on to my brothers house in near by romulus (south of the airport) for my niecses&#39; birth day. When I arrived needless to say the topic of conversation was the &#34;fire ball&#34; in the sky. Both my brothers inlaws and his oldeest daughter and her husband  saw it in seperat incedents. I thought they would say they saw it to the North, going from west to the east, but they too saw it to the south(they were further south of where myson and I witnessed it.This indicated to me that whatever it was, was a lot higher in the sky, and a lot larger than I had antisipated. I found out the next day that two people in my &#34;American History&#34; class I was atending at Eastern Michigan Univ. also saw it. One of these people is a girl that said she was heading down I-94 east bound Just west of I-275 when she saw it pass over, off to her right. I also talked to a friend of mine who lives s/w of me who was walking with his wife and they witnessed it also.<n>

I had just arrived home from work (I am a practicing Doctor of Chiropractic in Baltimore and travelled straight home after office hours). I was standing on my front porch.  I was totally sober and do not need sight corrective glasses.  The objects moved rapidly...about the speed of fast, low flying fighter jets.  They caught my eye because of the straight line formation that they maintained and the number of them. I originally thought that they may be jets but the comet like tails did not apply...jets don&#39;t have a highly visible tail at night and do not appear as an orange ball of fire. The comet-like tails dissipated into a shower of small sparks.  The largest was in front with smaller objects following.  All travelled in a straight, level line. They all began to disappear at the same time when they reached the north-east sky leaving a twinkling of sparks behind for approximately 1 second after the disappearance of the round objects which then slowly faded away.  This occurred during the Leonid meteor shower period but was unlike any falling star that I have ever seen.  The size, color, speed, formation, number, and sparking tail did not fit the appearance of a falling star (a falling star appeared within 20 seconds of the occurrence but was of a silver appearance, was much smaller in size, fell from overhead to the horizon in the north east sky, and disappeared as it approached the horizon).<n>

It was such an unusual sight that I caught my breath and stopped walking to watch. The front light seemed larger, maybe about the size of Venus. The trailing 3 lights were slightly smaller.  All were very bright neon green. They seemed to be perfectly spaced apart and were all moving at the same rate of speed. The rate of speed seemed slow for a &#34;shooting star&#34;.

The lights appeaed to be about thumb to little finger in size at arms length. The two green lights were bigger than the white lights. Within the row the lights were not evenly spaced but as the formation moved the distance between them remained the same and they remained in a line. I couldn&#39;t see anything connecting the lights. The length of the formation filled the width of my windshield. As they passed towards my left I rolled the window down but I could not hear anything other than the traffic which had slowed down considerably during this event.

It looked to fly directly over our campus, west to east, but it was fairly impossible to tell just how large or how high up it was.  It really freaked me out though...  There were about 10 other people within 100 yards of me on campus that noticed it too, and I heard loud yells of astonishment coming out of the windows of the dorms on campus near me (apparently they saw it too...).  Unfourtunatley, I had a limited field of view because of the surrounding buildings, but started to run to try and get a clearer view once it went behind a building, but couldn&#39;t get a clear view.  I later heard on the radio that the object had been seen around town, and was being explained away by local authorities as &#34;space debris&#34; on the radio.  It was a very big, very dramatic fireball, the likes of would never have imagined.  Later that night, I went with a friend to an observatory on top of one of the classroom buildings to try and see some of the Leonid Meteor action that was supposed to be taking place that night.  After being there for about a half hour, we were standing next to two older couples who were up there for the same reason.  One of the ladies suddenly said loudly, &#34;what is that?!&#34;  I looked up and after searching for an instant, I saw to my utter amazement a trianguler shaped object with no lights move silently overhead.  The clear night was disturbed by only a few very wispy and insignificant clouds at what looked to be about 2,000 plus feet, and the object just happened to catch my eye because of its movement, but my friend, and the other three older people couldn&#39;t spot it.  It was relatively the same shade as the night sky, and again, had no lights on it.  Well I felt like Iw as frozen, I was so surprised by the whole e! xperienc e.  I watched the object for a good 15 seconds before it disappeared above some of the low-level clouds that I mentioned, and was heading from north to nearly due south.  It the single most shocking-awe inspiring thing I have ever witnessed in my life.  To describe the craft in more detail, again, it was triangular in shape, and moving point-forward.  It had molding or cross-beams underneath that met in the center, and extended straight out to each of the three triangle points.  I am extremely familiar with military and civilian aircraft, and wasn&#39;t anything I&#39;ve ever seen or even heard of.  It was completely foreign.  And, again, possibly the wierdest and most disturbing thing was the fact that it had no lights, and flew SILENTLY directly overheadat what appeared to be no more than 4,000-5,000 feet i&#39;d estimate.  I know this sounds nuts, but I swear that it&#39;s absolutely true.  TO the say the least, it was one interesting evening.  First, the unbelievable fireball object, and then the UFO that I saw at the observatory.  And the fact that I wasn&#39;t even the first one to see the UFO helps me to be able to assure myself that, yeah, this really happened.  I will remember it for the rest of my life.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We have amended the date shown above to November 16, 1999.  Please see many other sightings for the same time and date.

At 19:05, I was walking facing eastward when I saw three bright lights.  They appeared to be decreasing altitude at first then changed and continued to the south.  The objects were &#34;flaking&#34; off small bits of light.  I continued to watch them until they disappeared to the south.<n>

My first thought was that someone had set off a bottle rocket; then I thought, as it was so bright, that it was a firework.  I got out of the car to listen for the &#39;boom&#39; and began to realize that the &#39;bottle rocket&#39; was on a horizontal trajectory and was not making any noise.  As it travelled overhead I tried hard to make sense of what I was seeing: the light of the leading part was very bright and there seemed to be trails of light off of it, but they did not expand in size the further they got away from the further they got away from the main source of light - they seemed more like dashes. I don&#39;t know how many of these following trails there were - more than one, I am sure.  I can&#39;t judge distance.  It seemed so close.  And it seemed to travel leisurely, unlike the brief blips of shooting stars I have witnessed. The &#39;bottle rocket&#39; continued to the east, disappearing into the trees to the right. Another man who was also in the lot at the same time and I briefly discussed the event with him.  I asked him what he thought he saw.  He said it was a large plane with trails of &#34;fire&#34;.  We both agreed that it made no noise.  I said that it seemed very close. We looked up to where it had been and could see the blinking lights from a far away plane; we agreed that it seemed to be much closer than the plane. I noticed the time when I returned to the car: 7:05 p.m. When I returned to the nursing home tonight others mentioned that one of the nurses had seen something while on break the night before.  She wasn&#39;t there for me to question. I am 51, female, interested in astronomy but not knowledgeable; I did go out this summer to watch for shooting stars during the August meteor showers(whose name I can&#39;t remember); this is the most interesting celestial event I have ever seen.

I am a 31 year old male who has worked in the security field for the last 13 years so I am trained to notice detail and times that unusual events occur. I also attended College at Wright State University Dayton Ohio and Lived on Campus which was right in the flight path for all aircraft landing at Wright-patterson airforce base so I am familiar with all conventional aircraft and I had never before seen an object of this type<n>

The lights never blinked, burned out, left sparks or changed position relative to each other.  They were spaced roughly evenly apart, with some a little higher or lower than the centerline of the formation. The length was equivalent to a grapefruit held at arm&#39;s length. The sky was clear with no stars and a half moon.  The unusual thing about this was that the formation was absolutely rigid from horizon to horizon.  I&#39;ve seen meteors before, and this did not look like that.  It could have been a solid object.  The altitude could have been 5,000 ft. or 50,000 ft., it was hard to tell.  I was looking about 45-60 deg. up from the south horizon as the formation moved W to E. There were two other planes far away, but none near or chasing the lights.<n>

It was about 19:05, and we had crossed over the Adams-Allen county line about 4 miles ago. I had heard about the meteor shower expected to start that night, so I&#39;m trying to look at the sky frequently. About that time, I noticed a bright green light about 10-15 degrees above the horizon, at about my 10 o&#39;clock position. From the angle that US 27 runs, this would have been about due west of me. I thought it was too low to be a meteor, but kept glancing at it, thinking it was probably an airplane. After a few seconds, I could start to see a short, green tail below and to the left. This got my interest, so I kept watching it. It appeared to be moving in our general direction, because it was getting higher in the sky and I could see more of the tail. Thinking this was going to be one spectacular meteor, I slowed down and pulled the car over. By this time, we had been watching the fireball for about 30 seconds, and it was now so high in the sky that I had to lean forward against the steering wheel and look almost straight up to see it. The tail was bright green, and took up a good 30 degrees of arc. It wasn&#39;t nearly as bright as the fireball, which was an intense white-green light, but it was bright enough to be easily seen. The tail was also as wide as the fireball, and had a cluster of about 5 bright greenish-white points of light in it, immediately behind the fireball. Trailing farther back in the tail were about 3 more lights, not grouped together. All of these were about the same color, and were bright enough to be easily seen in the tail, but the fireball was by far the brightest. I was stunned enough by what I was seeing that I didn&#39;t pay as much attention to some of the details as I should have. For example, the exact number lights in the tail, their motion relative to the fireball and each other, the exact time or duration, or the exact spot I pulled over at. I had n! ever see n anything like this, and kept thinking that it was moving awfully slow for a meteor. We sat and watched, discussing what we were seeing, while it moved farther down the sky toward my 4 o&#39;clock position, or about due east of me. As it got closer to the horizon, I noticed a gradual color change from the intense green-white to an orange color. Also, the fireball and tail were much dimmer and hard to see now. The trailing lights were all we could see as they became dimmer and darker orange, until I lost sight of them about 10-15 degrees above the horizon. I wasn&#39;t sure if the change in color and intensity were due to the meteor burning out, or if I was simply looking through too much atmosphere to see it well. From start to finish, I estimate the whole event took around a minute, maybe a minute and 15 seconds. My son saw most of this also, and was able to describe it in good detail to my wife later that night. Some background on myself: I&#39;m 35, a metrology technician for a major telecommunications company, and a ham radio operator.<n>

Thought they were fireballs...leaving &#34;ashes&#34; behind. These &#34;fireballs&#34; were emitting fire. Already wrote to the wrong place about this. I wrote the report as...witness saw 4 or 5 &#34;Strange fier-balls&#34;. Friend described the first one to be as big as my park. I thought it was a joke and told her and her husband, that it was from the meteor showers. At the time, that it what I thought, and wrote Mr. Davenport about it...though, at the wrong place. Now, it is after 1:30am, and I just heard Mr. Davenport on Art Bell. What he described was just what my friend&#39;s husband saw while driving through Trenton, Ont, Canada. They (fireballs) were streaming not streaking, down. The first one was mighty huge and the other 3 or 4 other &#34;fireballs&#34; were following in accordance. They were actually &#34;following&#34; the first big one. Instead of dust trails, the witness saw &#34;ashes&#34; coming from the tail end of these...&#34;fireballs&#34;. Now I know, that meteor showers do not do such thing. They go any which way, but they do not follow each other like what was witnessed. All I can say, is this...THEY&#39;RE COMING!!! YOU CAN&#39;T STOP THEM...THEY&#39;RE HERE!!! And no, I&#39;m not a lunatic...I&#39;m just being realistc...like Peter Davenport and all of you, who maintain this website...Be careful out there folks.<n>

It as sparkling somewhat like a sparkler except the colors were only yellow and white. I was turning east so when it passed my line of sight followed. The object appeared to be a little larger than a basket ball, althuogh I could not see the back portion. I noted that it appeared to pass through the tops of two maple tree in the neighbors yard and I stoped in front of them and could see a smoke or vapor trail into the trees at the end of the feild behind the yard. I&#39;m an aviation nut and have spent some time watching planes landing and feel that I can estimate the speed to have been under 200mph. I beleive that the object would have come to ground in less than a mile. The elevation at the point I saw the object is 850 ft and there are some ridges beyond that point that are 850 ft +. I&#39;ve been trying to get better cordinates in order to limit the search area and intend to look for it. Within 15 minuets helicopters searched the area.<n>

A neighbor witnessed the object with me and said it could not have been a meteor because it was traveling too slow and did not burn up.

I would estimate that the object was at about 1,000ft altitude, with the length of the object at around 300-1,000ft, and estimated speed of the object at around 75-100mph. I first saw the light through some tree branches and thought someone was lighting fireworks off. Then when the object passed a tree where I could get a look at it I said &#34;what in the world is that?&#34; because my neighbor was getting out of his car. When he witnessed the object, he said &#34;are we seeing ufo&#39;s or something?&#34; He dismissed the object as being a meteor because it was moving so slow, and because it was fairly close to the ground. The object went right over Wright Patterson AFB and continued in a north-westerly direction.<n>

The large window next to the television has a half moon window above it. I witnessed a large  long continuous light passing across it slowly. I often see aircraft passing in the night, but this was huge, bright and moving slowly. I jumped up from the sofa and ran to the window. Looking up  at this moving light I noticed many, many smaller whitish lights moving alongside the huger light. I was alittle scared because it was like nothing I had seen before. I have seen meteorites flashing across the sky in arches, but this moved slowly and in a straight direction. I would say from the position of the window that I saw this from, that it was moving in a north easterly direction. It looked like a large passenger train, deep and long in shape. I ran to my front door and outside believing that because it was moving so slowly that I would continue to be able to see it, but it had already moved out of vision. I called my husband at the hospital, where he works to tell him and to see if anyone else had seen this. Later in th evening on the news, other people described that they had also been witness to this strange phenomena.<n>

I noticed a bright light. It was apprx. 45 to 60 degrees up from the horizon travelling from west to east. The object was apprx. the size of a thumb at arms length. The main body was bright white and had a trail behind it with varied colors of blue, red, and yellow. The trail also had 2 or 3 additional white lights in it which appeared to be more objects rather than part of the trail. The trail looked more like burning particles or embers rather than a fire trail. The trail was very long about 10 times the length of the main body. At first glance I thought I was witnessing a missle flying through the air. I witnessed these events for apprx. 30 seconds. It did not appear to me to be a meteor, but could have possibly been an extremely large piece of space debris.<n>

They appeared to be moving mch faster than an airplane and in perfect fromation.

I was looking out the driver side window of my car when I saw 4-5 bright red lights low in the sky.  At first I thought it was a large plane getting ready to land at the Martinsgurg airport because it was in that direction and there are large planes that land there.  But the lights were far enough apart that it grabbed my attention and I thought  &#34;that is a VERY large plane.&#34;  At that point the lights appeared to make a sharp turn very quickly so that they were suddenly in front of me at a height that I could see them straight out my front wind shield.  They were all evenly spaced and looked about the size of lights you see on an airplane when it is about 500 feet up and the first light had a tail like a comet.  I slowed my car to watch it as did the car infront of me. Then the lights disappeared and there was no trace of the lights and I looked and looked for them.  I looked at my car clock so that I could document the time and it was 7:05pm. It was a prefectly clear night.  I have a fasination with watching the sky day and night and have seen many meteors, satalites, etc. and nothing has looked like this.  When I got to my friends house I told him what I saw.<n>

At 19:05 on 11/16/99 I had stopped for a coffee break at a small service station at Whitmore Lake, Mi. This is approx.10 mi. north of Ann Arbor,Mi. I walked out of the station, facing approx. due south. I noticed a bright light in the sky approaching from what I believe to be 250-270 west degrees. As it got closer, 4 smaller objects became visible trailing the large one. I had a very good view as the objects passed at approx. 20 degrees off vertical to my south. As they got closer, short blueish-white tails became visible. There was absolutley no sound. The smaller objects appeared to change position in relation to the larger one. My best description of shape is roundish to teardrop. Estimated size was  a dime held at arms length for the large one, and a B-B for the smaller ones. I had a completely unobstructed view for near 2 mins. It faded out of sight-range headed 75-90 degrees east. I have been an avid night sky watcher for years. Truck driving for 17 years mostly at night. I also spent the mid 70s as an Air Force flight line mechanic.My first thought was it was a meteor, as i had been anticipating the Leonids. When I first saw this Iwas expecting it burn out soon. I was greatly surprised to watch it almost from horizon to horizon. The skies were completely clear. Many aircraft were visible in the area as I was approx. 30 miles NW of Detriot Metro airport. It had to have been visible to pilots and ground controllers in the area. As I said, I have been sky viewing for years,and this was something completely new and different to anything I ever saw before. I can be best contacted between 1200-1600 eastern time.<n>

The fireball was white and orange, and, from where we were, appeared to possibly have been breaking apart.  It seemed to be moving quite fast.  We only saw it for approximately 10 seconds, though we may had witnessed it longer had there not been trees above us blocking our view.  We attempted to follow it, but when we had initially seen it we were pulling up to stop sign, and by the time we could go, it was too late.  My friend and I are both amateur UFO enthusiasts, and I had come to the conclusion that what we had seen might had been a comet, but we marvelled at the size of it.  It was rather large.  Upon hearing about all the reportings of it, I thought it would be best to also report what we had seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> NUFORC Note:  We assume the witness is addressing the event that occurred that evening, and that was witnessed from Wisconsin to New York, and as far south as Tennessee.

After opening them, I was heading back to the cab of the truck. A bright light had captured my attention. I looked up and saw what I thought to be a comet or meteor. I was rather excited to see it coming right over me. I noticed as it went overhead its color was similar to burning copper. It was traveling rather slow. About the same speed as a small propeller aircraft. In its tail was sparks such as a chain being dragged along the road, or as some fireworks give off. I climbed in the truck and got on my c.b. and tried to talk to a friend of mine, but there was nothing. No static or other truckers talking. I thought there was a problem with my c.b., but when the meteor passed the chatter came back. There were other truckers taking about the meteor and that they had also experienced a brief radio blackout. I got back to the factory to deliver my load (which is 8 miles away) and I was telling another driver about the meteor. She had said that it caught her eye as she was backing to a loading dock and her c.b. went quiet also.<n>

The fireball was white in color, then I noticed in seemed to break into 3 separate, and smaller pieces. The 3 pcs where moving almost in a row. I noticed that the objects where bright enough to make the vehicles in front of me to cast slight shadows. The objects changed color quickly to blue , then yellow, green, then red, finally orange amber. As the colors changed, the brightness dimmed respectively.  By the time the objects turned amber, and dim They disappeared over the eastern horizon.about 10 degrees south. I was 4 miles from home at this time. My home co-ords are: 39deg 55&#39;28&#34;N, 83deg 49&#39;31&#34;W. When I first noticed the single object, it was appx 60 deg from north horz. and 90 west(exact middle of sky east to west). About 5 seconds later it divided into 3 then, it took about 50 seconds or so untill they disappeared from my view. I don&#39;t do drugs, and had not been drinking. I&#39;m a quality engineer by profession. Have been an amateur astronomer since childhood. Have NEVER seen anything like this before. At first I thought it was a meteor, but knowing Leonids comes from almost the opposite direction, I think this might have been space junk. This event was similar to fireworks. It appeared  to be losing altitude, thought it was going to crash at first. It would be interesting to find-out what this is.<n>

I went into my house and, after about 15 minutes of pondering what I had seen, I called the sheriff&#39;s office.  The person I spoke to said that they had received a lot of calls and that what everybody was seeing was just part of a meteor shower.  It was an evening when the Leonids were supposed to be visible, but it was my understanding that this was only in the eastern sky.  This really large, object moved parallel to the horizen, from west to east. (I&#39;m writing this 7 months after the event; I keep thinking about what I saw!)<n>

Appeared from the North East at approx 39 degrees from the horizon . The object was moving unusualy slow for a meteor and was following the horizon as it went past.  As it passed at almost a due north position it began to to drop bright yellow spheres of what appeared to be debris from the mainbody.  The colors and brightness were like nothing I have ever seen. It continued on a trajectory parallel with the surface and went out of sight.  Absolutely the most outstanding light show that I have ever witnessed.  My impression was that it was space debris because of the trajectory and the speed which again was unusually slow for a meteor. Unfortunately I was 20 yards from my video camera at the moment it appeared.  Sorry I can&#39;t provide a picture.  However Whas 84 had a listner call in about 1045PM to the talk show and stated he had live video of this event as viewed from Southern Indiana and he stated that it would be on the 11pm news.Ironically just out of curiosity I did a search on compuserve for the meteor shower for this week and found your web site just earlier today, now that&#39;s good timing !!!<n>

I looked out the window, and from my seated position on my sofa could see a streak of fire/light contining four or five very large fireballs, moving across the sky towards the eastern horizon.  I rose from my chair and moved to the window to see just a faint view of them above the neighbors house, lost to the Eastern horizon.  I commented to my wife of what I had seen, but I don&#39;t think she had an opportunity to see them.  I was reminded of the &#34;string of pearls&#34; photos that I had seen of the asteroid that struck Jupiter a few years ago.  It reminded me very much of that.  I perceived it to be a huge falling star, several individual objects, very, very bright in color, almost white, moving at a very high rate of speed across my field of view.<n>

Only 1 (one) object was observed at the date and time noted above.  It was golden in color with bright green and orange showing up at one point during the observation. I have seen a similar object like the one described above in the late winter of 1995 while standing at a bus stop.  However, the second observer, my mother, has most likely observed a UFO in the late fall of 1978 along with my sister.  Their observation of the craft they seen that night sounds increadible.<n>

(EST).  We have changed the estimated time in this report.))  Light bacame bright and changed into elongated form then split into 3 or four objects heading east somewhere around ~20,000 feet<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was in the American Airlines flight 785 scheduled to leave New York Laguardia at 17:55 on 17 November 1999.  We left about 15 minutes late from the gate and didn&#39;t take off for about another 35 minutes.  After we left the ground the pilot came over the PA and said we had Philadelphia out the left and would soon see Wilmington.  I looked out my window to the North.  I knew it was north because I had located the big dipper and had found the North star.  We were heading close to due west.  Out my window I noticed a light and thought it was another airplane.  The light appeared to be at a slightly lower altitude than the one we were at.  I watched the light and noticed that it was getting brighter.  Thus it was either getting closer or increasing in brightness.  I thought it was an airplane and started getting nervous as it appeared to be coming directly at us.  That is it&#39;s brightness increased.  I then noticed that it got extremely bright in the center and appeared to have an airplane like shape.  That is a bright center and tapered to the east and west as if it had two bright wings.  All this time it appeared as a bright white light.  Next I heard the pilot say something about a meteor out of my side of the plane.  I then noticed that the bright flattened shaped light appeared to explode into two or three more objects heading due east.  I then truned and told the fellow next to me that he should look at the meteor too.  He did and also saw what followed.  The bright initial light appeared to slowly fade into nothing.  The 2 or 3 objects that were left then headed due east.  One after the other apparently on the same course.  They moved very slowly and had a long tails that were about the same distance or a little less than the distance between the two stars of the big dipper which point to the north star.  The tails appeared to be the same length.  The were about the same luminosity except for the front which was slightly different.  I did notice that after the length of the tail there was no sign of ! a dim ta il, it was totally dark as was the rest of the sky.  The objects moved off to the east at constant altitude.  The total episode taking from 30 seconds to as much as two minutes.  I was distracted by the pilots comments and then that it was a meteor so I didn&#39;t watch it continuously and really did not see the objects disappear.  I did notice that at some point they were no longer visible.  The trajectory of the objects was neither up or down in the vertical direction.  The witnesses included myself, the person sitting next to me and at least one pilot.  I am not sure about whether other people on the plane had noticed the event.  I am not sure of the time but believe it to be between 18:45 and 19:15 Eastern.<n>

It was travelling from my left to my right, west to east.  I watched the light until I could no longer see it, 15-20 seconds.  It was behind a group of trees so I never saw it in the open sky.  The color remained greenish with white splotches.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I first saw the object it was just a spere or ball shape.  It startled me so I dashed from my vehicle to the corner of my house, about 3 seconds.  When I next looked the object had elongated into what looked like a streak of green and white.  There were many breaks in the streak because of the trees.  My first thought was that it might have been a firecraker someone had set off, but it lasted to long.  It appeared that from the head area little white lights kept on being emitted.  The light  travelled from my left to my right, which would be a west to east direction.  It maintained a straight path, never vering in any direction.  I never saw the object in the open sky, as it moved behind a tree line in front of my house.  We live on a hill and I had only a slight upward glance to see it plainly.  It appeared to be very close to the ground from my perspective.  I have never seen anything like this before.  I have seen shooting stars and this was nothing like that.  The closest thing I could think of that it resembled was seeing fireworks on the 4th of July, close, right here in my own town.  I contacted our local sheriffs office the morning, 11/17/99, to see if anyone else had seen this light.  They told me that they had received about 200 call regarding this light starting at about 7:02pm est the night of the 16th.  I was told of Eric Shipman who also saw the light, and who has contacted your office via phone.  We had a great talk and I got your website from him in order to file this report.  I don&#39;t necessarily need to be contacted by an investigator, but have no objection to it either.  If you are interested in the number of our local sheriff office it is 740-286-6464.  I don&#39;t know what kind of information they documented regarding all the calls they got. But it might be another source for your office.<n>

I was about 1 mile south of the I-75 and I-70 interchange. I saw a large slow moving ball of fire moving horizontally from west to the east. At first I thought it was a jet on fire. The Datyon Airport is just a few miles west/northwest from where I was travling. The object was burning with a greenish yellow color. A long train of fire was behind it. At first it looked like one object. As it went to the east I saw several pieces behind it. (In a train formation) The object(s) never lost any altitude as I watch it move. The next day I saw a short video of the object that someone had video taped. The video was shown on either channel 12 or channel 9 WPCO news.<n>

I looked up to check the traffic and the object caught my eye.  I was alone.  A car did pass by when I was looking.  There was a fireball in the sky.  It had a long tail.  Holding my hand at a distance, the tail was longer than my hand.  The main part was throwing off debris.  They quickly burned out.  There were two smaller objects trailing the main object.  They were keeping pace with the main object.  In respect to actual meteorites the object appeared to be moving rather slow.  The object did not change direction at all while I was watching it.  It appeared to be a natural, though rare event.  There was an event filmed at a high school game in Pittsburgh several years ago, that this fireball reminded me of.  It would be interesting to see if it came down anywhere on land.<n>

The object was orangeish in color with a bright whitish round object at the leading edge and 3-5 smaller whitish round objects nearly equally spaced behind it.  I am not sure how long it was but when the center was straight ahead of me, it spanned the length of my windshield and I could still see the tail end out the driver side window. I had assumed that it was a meteor since the meteor shower was tonight, but the more I thought about, it was not like any meteor I have ever witnessed with my eyes nor seen in pictures.  WHen I heard the other witnesses describing a similar nearly identical object on Art Bell tonight, I was prompted to file a report.<n>

Sometimes I enjoy watching planes fly above the city. I was looking out my window early in the evening on Tuesday, November 16, 1999, and I saw a very bright, white triangular shaped object with a long bright white tail. It looked large enough to be close but I didn&#39;t hear any sound from it. It moved directly east towards Lake Michigan and eventually I lost sight of it. I probably saw it for 15-25 seconds. I&#39;m not saying I think it was a UFO, but I don&#39;t think it was a regular plane either. Plane lights generally flash, this object was a solid bright white the entire time. Plus, it had a very bright white tail. Finally, it moved very quickly. I think when a plane moves that fast it makes some sort of sonic boom sound. The main reason I&#39;m reporting this is because I think anyone who saw it would be interested in knowing if others saw it. I&#39;d like to know more about it.<n>

It came from the west and was traveling slowly towards the east It had 4 cylinder type bright lights with black or dark spaces connecting them. It lasted for around 1 minute.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Looking out my livingroom window (about a 7&#39; wide window) a tail form bright light went by the window. The quarter moon was just above the tree line and this object passed by my window some- where between the moon and the tree line.  It was low. It was not high in the sky.  I was standing walking towards the window in a dark room to turn the T.V. on. I was not sitting looking out the window at the sky.  The object had 4 sections. There was a bright light with I believe window type things around it.  Then there was a dark section then another bright light then another dark section then another bright light then another dark section then another bright light.  They were definitely connected.  I stood in awe for around 30 seconds then ran outside my front door.  It was traveling from the west to the east across my front yard.  It was not a whoosh - fast movement. It was not a slow movement. It was just there cruising across my yard.  There was no wind noise or engine noise. There was no sign I saw something go by.  It was gone within a minute or so.  We have a field on the west side of our home and a woods on the east side. The house faces the south and we have a railroad track behind our house. When I ran outside I saw nothing but a lot of stars in the sky. I saw on the evening news the next evening a picture someone sent in of the meteor that was breaking up. That was NOT it.  What I saw was definitely different. I have seen many shooting stars, many meteor showers and I have also seen the Northern Lights once. I live in a country atmosphere without any city lights around. I have one neighbor to the south of us. There house faces the east where ours faces the south. My husband came home from work around 1:30 a.m. that evening. He was listening to ART Bell on A.M. 800 CKLW and he heard many people calling in and describing EXACTLY what I described to him when I called him at work around 7:30P.M. or that same night.  I have never seen an object like this in my past. I&#39;m not sure what I saw but I know it was not the meteor the media is telling me I saw. The object did not leave a trail. It was bright and clear with no haze around it at all.  No color just a bright brilliance. There were no aircraft in the area. Thank-You!<n>

At first I thought it was a firework, but it was maintaining a horizontal path from horizon to horizon.  I would characterize it as something entering the atmosphere except it appeared to be lower than normal 747 style traffic, or it was quite large, but the detail in the flame would make me believe that it was closer to the ground that far away.  Also there where small orange lights coming out the back.  I believed it to be ember type material breaking away but the lights fell directly back, one at a time evening spaced and they didnt fall away as I would expect waste material to do.  They were evenly spaced and fell directly behind the object, but still seemed to be keeping up with the green flame which is why I think it was not just a meteorite.  Apparently from the number of calls you were getting many people seen it,  i was in my car pulling out of a coffee shop at the time so I dont know if it made noise.  there were probably 10 to 15 people seated outside the coffee shop and I noticed that all of them were up and looking as well.<n>

It was approximately seven p.m. when I taped the message on the mailbox and was walking back to my house.   I suddenly saw something huge over my right shoulder.  It seemed to be only about a block away.  It was shaped like a long triangle- almost like a cone on its side.  It was made up of pulsating pale green lights, and it was moving east very slowly.  I looked around to tell someone--I know my mouth had dropped open. My labrador retriever was waiting at the gate for me, but he was the only one around.  I actually started to stop a car that was coming toward me from the direction of the object, but by that time it was disappearing behind the houses.  I estimate it was visible for about ten seconds.  It&#39;s difficult to gage the size of the object, because I&#39;m sure my perception cannot be correct.  It seemed to be the size of a semi-truck less than a block away. I came inside and told my family, then I called the police department to see if anyone else had seen this huge green triangle over Central Avenue.  The dispatcher said yes, it was a meteor shower.  That&#39;s what everyone is seeing. I&#39;m sure everyone who sees what I saw tonight will be told it was a meteor shower. But what I saw appeared to be some kind of machinery.  A giant, silent piece of machinery.  Shortly after I called the police we noticed an unusual number of planes in the area. I have no idea what kind of machine I saw.  I wonder if Wright Patterson has something unworldly going on.  I don&#39;t know, but this is what I saw.<n>

This object had a tale extending at least four moon widths in length dropping material of a reddish color as it traversed very slowly across my field of view. I watched and slowed down as 9 to 11 seconds of time elapsed, and the object seemed to not change in intensity or size, but went over the northeastern horizon. The magnitude of this object rivaled the half moon present at the time. An accurate indication altitude was not readily apparent to me at the time, but the feeling I got was that it was large and not high up, moving very slowly for a meteor. My crude estimate of altitude is 3-4 miles.<n>

As the light receeded, and very quickly dimmed, several individual, smaller lights became visible in the tail.  These lights were spaced (in quite significant length) out along the line of trajectory, and also disappeared very quickly.   I thought of the comet Shoemaker Levy as it broke up before it impacted Jupiter, when I saw the individual lights trailing out in what seemed like a great distance.  I cannot understand why these individual lights were not immediately visible, when I first saw the object.  They only appeared when the initial bright light had faded.  There were perhaps 3 or 4 individual lights trailing behind, with perhaps the space between the last and second last light larger than the space between the second last and third last light, etc. I was in my car travelling north along Campground Road when I saw it. Earlier this Fall I saw a very similar bright light, travelling in the about the same direction, at about the same speed which at that time, I dismissed as fire works as I only saw it for perhaps one or two seconds as it passed overhead.<n>

My neighbor also saw it &amp; began calling for his wife.  At this time I ran into my house to get my husband and we watched as it passed outside our kitchen window and dissapeared past the horizon in the west.  It was huge, as large as an ocean liner and moving at least 60mph.  This was the same night as the Leonoid meteor showers, but this was NOT a meteor!  Alot of other people in Ohio, Michigan and Kentucky also saw this object.  Those who did see it have said it was definately not a meteor or satillite.<n>

My back was facing the row of windows overlooking our back yard and approximately 50 yards of woods separating us from the next street over.  My 2 year old daughter was playing on the couch next to me, facing the windows, when she gasped and looked up out the windows.  I turned around quickly, my father a few feet away looked up.  We saw what at first looked like the bright lights from a bottle rockets, traveling horizontally in the woods.  But then we realized the lights were not dying out.  From what we could tell as it glided over the treetops, it was in my estimation at least 60 feet long and narrow.  Cigar shaped, traveling about 20-25 feet in the air at about 20 mph.  When we first saw it, my father recalled the meteor shower expected in 2 days, but as it went by, we realized it was too close to the ground, and definitely not fading.  It also traveled in a steady straight line with respect to the horizon.  The lights themselves were almost like white light.  Some seemed stationary on the object while others streaked by with the continuous movement of the object, sort of like a trail along side.  It was like a long skinny bus moving through the sky.  It made no sound, but about 10 minutes later, the phone module on the wall emitted radio (police-type) sounds, with the phone on the hook.  My mother said that that happens every once in a while and thought it was unrelated.  I have always believed in the possibility, but I have never seen anything like that.  It was so surreal.  The eerie part is, if my daughter hadn&#39;t looked up at that moment, we never would have known.  My skeptic father came right out and said he was creeped out. I will check with the state and local police and watch the newspaper to see if anyone else saw it.  I would like to take a walk in the woods there tomorrow and see if anything was disturbed.<n>

At approximately 1900 hours, we witnessed five medium-sized orange fireballs with long tails that sparkled at the ends.  There was a quiet burning sound associated with them, but they were definately not jets or any other type of airplane.  They were all moving at the same speed at an even pace, all equidistant, flying from the west to the northeast.  As they were going toward the northeast, they winked out like a dimmer-switch being turned all the way down.  The police officer checked with her dispatch and the 911 center was lit up with phone calls from all over the city.  One woman apparently described what she saw as a Chinese dragon, the orange lights moving as a Chinese dragon in a parade.<n>

Out of the corner of my eye, an extremely bright light in the sky caught my eye. I turned to look, and saw 5 or 6 very large balls of light in the sky. The moon was full and I had the porch lights on, but the balls of light were highly visible. They were as bright, if not brighter than the moon. What was remarkable, to me, was their size. They looked like baseballs, compared to the other stars in the sky. The main one was about the size of half the moon.  They seemed to travel in a cluster, but not necessarily at the same rate of speed, but it may have just been my perspective. I said &#34;oh my god!&#34; and ran along the deck of the house to keep it in view as it went behind a tree.  There was a trail arcing behind the cluster, each ball had it&#39;s own trail and they merged into one tapering trail. This trail was very colorful, starting with a green, then red, orange, then sort of purpleyblue. It was beautiful, and I&#39;ve never seen anything like it before. It arched across the sky and was visible for about 30 seconds, maybe less, and then suddenly disappeared.  The tail didn&#39;t linger after the balls of light went out. I called a friend who is &#34;into&#34; astronomy and he said it was probably a bolide. I looked up &#34;bolide&#34; on the Web, but none of the picures of bolides looked anything like what I saw. This was very crisp and clear, my first thought was that it looked incandescent and like someone had drawn it in the sky, like a cartoon.  I watched the news to see if anyone had reported it (actually I thought it was probably part of the Leonids, even tho it was earlier in the night than the Leonids were expected) but I didn&#39;t see anything on the news, so I thought I was the only one who saw it. I told my cousin about it - she lives in Cadillac MI, and she had seen it too! She told me about your web site, where I saw the request for people who had seen this to fill out a report. It was eerie because the event was totally silent.<n>

I had to duck down and look up to see what she was talking about. It was a great fireball with several small pieces breaking off and trailing behind it as it traveled from the West at 260&#39; to the East at 080&#39;. I had to look up at about a 50&#39; angle to see it as it passed directly in front of my vehicle&#39;s position due south of me. I continued to follow it even after it stopped burning. It turned a dark amber and I could clearly see that it was a large, somewhat round, meteor. It disappeared into the haze at the horizon between 5 to 10&#39; elevation. I would estimate its speed to be 4 times that of the space shuttle. It was visible for atleast 30 seconds if not longer as we did not see this from the start of the event. Several local TV stations have shown home video of it which I will send by UPS.<n>

We left about 15 minutes late from the gate and didn&#39;t take off for about another 35 minutes.  After we left the ground the pilot came over the PA and said we had Philadelphia out the left and would soon see Wilmington.  I looked out my window to the North.  I knew it was north because I had located the big dipper and had found the North star.  We were heading close to due west.  Out my window I noticed a light and thought it was another airplane.  The light appeared to be at a slightly lower altitude than the one we were at.  I watched the light and noticed that it was getting brighter.  Thus it was either getting closer or increasing in brightness.  I thought it was an airplane and started getting nervous as it appeared to be coming directly at us.  That is it&#39;s brightness increased.  I then noticed that it got extremely bright in the center and appeared to have an airplane like shape.  That is a bright center and tapered to the east and west as if it had two bright wings.  All this time it appeared as a bright white light.  Next I heard the pilot say something about a meteor out of my side of the plane.  I then noticed that the bright flattened shaped light appeared to explode into two or three more objects heading due east.  I then truned and told the fellow next to me that he should look at the meteor too.  He did and also saw what followed.  The bright initial light appeared to slowly fade into nothing.  The 2 or 3 objects that were left then headed due east.  One after the other apparently on the same course.  They moved very slowly and had a long tails that were about the same distance or a little less than the distance between the two stars of the big dipper which point to the north star.  The tails appeared to be the same length.  The were about the same luminosity except for the front which was slightly different.  I did notice that after the length of the tail there was no sign of a dim tail, it was totally dark as was the rest of the sky.  The objects moved off to the east at constant altitude.  The total episode taking from 30 seconds to as much as two minutes.  I was distracted by the pilots comments and then that it was a meteor so I didn&#39;t watch it continuously and really did not see the objects disappear.  I did notice that at some point they were no longer visible.  The trajectory of the objects was neither up or down in the vertical direction.  The witnesses included myself, the person sitting next to me and at least one pilot.  I am not sure about whether other people on the plane had noticed the event.  I am not sure of the time but believe it to be between 18:45 and 19:15 Eastern.<n>

Once again, this appeared as a light with very long lines of light trailing it. Eliminated this as a reflection in that it was crystal clear and I could distinguish in my depth perception that this was well in front of me.  Trailing light appeared mostly white but had other colors mixed in.  The light crossed my view and turned heading past me on my right.  For a brief second it appeared the light was coming at that point from the electrical lines to my right, but moved to appear to stop atop the ridge paralleling the Ohio River.  At that point there appeared to be 4  distinct light from that point.  Then all traces disappeared.  I do not have any opinion 1 way or the other regarding ufos, but cannot explain what I saw.  I am 100% sure this was no reflection.  The object moved at a speed approximating that of a slow aircraft.<n>

The lights where traveling from the west to the east at a slow rate of speed(it resembled a blimp landing). The lights looked like they were 1/4 to 1/2 a mile away about 30 degrees up 500 to 700 feet above ground. There was a bright light on the east side with what looked liked a long series of bright and dim lights the length of it aprx. 100 to 150 feet long. The trail lights wasn&#39;t like a trail from a comet it had distinct shape and it was not hazey like a comet trail. It was rectangular in shape long and thin band(resembled a banner on a computer). The back of the object was slightly higher than the front aprx. 30 degree angle from west to east. As the light&#39;s drifted into the tree line the lights changed to a reddish orange color than went behind the tree line. After I top the hill the lights were gone. I watched the light&#39;s for about 20 seconds. Please feel free to contact me if you need more information.<n>

I slowed my car and pulled over onto the shoulder. I was in a panic when the next thought was this was a meteor which had not burned up. The size if it was huge, approximately the size of a doppler radar globe. I was trying to remember how large of an explosion would be generated by one this size when it began to slow down. As it slowed, the tail was breaking up into sparkles and it sounded like static as a television shuts down-crackling. It was moving West to East. It passed over a gas station toward fields. I sat there a moment in shock but too afraid to investigate in the dark. The next morning, I left for work early and drove down the country road it had &#34;gone down&#34; in. There were no broken trees or holes or scorched fields. I have no idea what I saw but it was not a plane, nor a meteor. It was about tree top level and speed was observable, meaning it was not in the far reaches of space.<n>

Between my bldg. and the guard shack I noticed a new light in the night sky. looking s-se and about 30 degrees inclination a bright yellow-orange, more yellow than a halogen light, sitting in the sky. No motion whatsoever could be discerned. I entered the guard shack and told the captian of this and he came outside with me and it was gone. no trace anywhere in the sky. I blew it off for the most part, however I did discuss it with colleagues and a late night guard seargant and my girlfriend as well. I forgot about it until I read the reports from last night at CAUS.org. I work and live very near two different airports and know that even at a great distance at night you can see both strobes and movement of aircraft and I noticed neither of these. I also live in an area where we have quite a bit of aerial police helicopter activity and the search lights are very different from this. No one I have spoken to has seen this but me.<n>

This ball travelled in a straight Horizontal line across the sky in an easterly direction.

We observed the incident for 30 seconds or more.  There did not appear to be any overhead electrical lines or aircraft in the area.<n>

They will be submitting a report as well a bit later as they are not at home right now. This is as fresh as it gets as I wrote down the descritions as they talked verbatum.*** Mother and son were driving South in the town of Sycamore Ill to Dekalb, Il to visit her daughter. They were still within the city limits and on a main road when the sighting occured. The son excitedly told his mother to look out of the window to the right and at first saw the lights of a small low flying airplane. Then she saw what the son saw and she said, &#34;almost had a heart attack&#34;. She pulled the car over to the shoulder extreemly quickly and both exited the car to look at the object. The mother and son both saw what appeared to be a large &#34;fireball&#34; type object streaking across the sky from the West to the East. She described the size as that of a basketball or two in diameter with a long, solid tail coming off of the end that was 10 &#34;heads&#34; long. she said that the head of it was very clearly defined and circular. They both agreed that both the head and the tail were multi-colored and that the head was mostly red with white, purple, and yellow. They both watched the event for what theysaid could have been as long as 4 minutes from the time the son saw it until it dissapeared below the horison to the East. The object was moving quickly but slow enough for them to stop get out of the car and watch it traverse the sky for some time. The son was particulary adiment on the fact that the object &#34;lit&#34; the surounding area enough that when he looked into the car he could clearly see the dirt on the floor of the car in an otherwise dark area. The woman also agreed that the surroundings were definately illuminted by the object but oculd give no exact mesurement because she never took her eyes off of the object. The woman was particulary shaken because she grew up in a house where her brother was a meterologist and spent much of her life with her head pointed to the sky and said it looked like no meteor she had ever seen. She said, &#34;I&#39;m fourty years old and I have NEVER seen anything like this in my life.&#34; The last thing she mentioned was that after the event, both her and her sons eyes &#34;felt strange&#34; and that they &#34;stung and felt slightly burned&#34;. She said that her eyesight was physically diffrent as they drove on and even an hour and a half after the event when I spoke to them her eyes still felt a bit strange. Finally I asked her if she could give some kind of real life example and she said the only thing she could equate it to was how the &#34;meteor&#34; looked in the movie Deep Impact.<n>

The light traveled in a southwest to north east direction across an arc of the sky roughly equal to the apparent distance between the tip of my thumb and the tip of my outstretched forefinger at arms length. The light seemed to follow  a slightly meandering path, though that might have been an optical illusion (I&amp;#8217;ve noticed that the eye is often fooled when trying to follow the path of blinking lights, like a distant airplane, at night. While this light was not blinking, the same effect might have been occurring here.)The light started out bright white and gradually faded to a tiny dull red point before disappearing completely. In total the object was in view for 7-10 seconds. In my opinion it was moving too slow for a typical meteor. It also lacked the characteristic streak of a meteor. This light was a distinct pinprick of light throughout the observation. It actually resembled a satellite, but the fading effect and the apparent erratic course was unlike any satellite I&amp;#8217;ve ever seen. Thinking it was an airplane, I made a conscious effort to discern strobes. There were none. I am 42 years old, work in marketing at a major national corporation, and have no bad habits that affect my powers of observation. I am an experienced outdoorsman with a better than average familiarity with aerial and astronomical phenomena.<n>

At first I thought it was an airplane but it was flying too close and too fast.  In comparison to an airplane i would say to probably flow 10 times as fast.  I&#39;ve watched airplanes fly across the sky before but no normal airplane goes that fast.  It also eluminated a bright green light, which was constant.  My Fiance came out and was also stunned.  It flow as if to go right over the horizon.  i also noticed alot of air traffic.<n>

At my point of veiw i lovst sigh of it because the tree blocked it. i was in nashville at the time of this and then i watched the news and in sumner couty it caught the grass of fire. i saw the main fireball then i saw pieces in the direct back of this blazing fireball. They say it has to do with the meteors, but im not sure about that i think its something more to this than meets the eye. I would love to find out what this is all about thank you for reading this.<n>

At first i thought that maybe a plane was crashing, because it was going really fast, but it was neon green so that wouldnt have made much sence. Well, with my girlfriend right beside me, we watched it for about 5 seconds when, as it kinda got close to the ground, it seemed to stop for a second and then split into 5 or 6 seperate balls of light, like 5 or 6 airplanes. Which reminds me, it looked as though it was near the airplanes in the sky so it couldnt have been too far off the ground, especially towards the end. Now, i know tonight there was supposed to be some meteor shower, but that didnt look like it to me, but if i could get some feedback on that then that would be great.<n>

I noticed to my right (west) a stream of blue green lights glowing in the western sky, just above the horizen moving in an eastern direction. At first I though that an large airliner was making an approch to land,except for the fact that there were no landing stips in the area. I pulled over and got out of the vehicle as fast as I could. I continued to watch the three balls of light drift almost directly over me. The stream was stretching across the sky at about 30 degrees right above where I was standing. The tail looked like orange yellow sparkles that faded as it passed over me. It faded or burned up completely just as it passed over me. I heard on the radio at about 13:06 EST that they mentioned that the Leonids meteor shower would be active but that the sighting that they descibed (very briefly) was what I had seen was not part of the Leonids but mearly a stray! If it was a Russian rocket booster (Yeah right!),they should get a gold medal for making it this far east.<n>

After I traveled approx. 1 mile I came out from behind a wooded area and there it was, huge alternating red and orange ball of fire on my left. Flying at least 100 mph toward the east. The tail was changing in length and intensity as it went over the highway in front and above me. Approx. 1000 to 2000 feet off the ground. It appeared to have something maybe burned up debris being set free of the tail and falling.

As it grew closer i realized the object was to large to be a plane. In addition it had no flashing lights or landing lights. It was very long in length, possibly 200&#39; to 500&#39; feet. It had a row of what apeared to be windows yellow orange in color, with several lights in the front and rear the same color. It seamed to slow as it got closer to my truck, almost directly in front, about 1/4 mile away. It dipped down behind some trees, and dissapeared. My son as well as myself witnessed this object. When i came around the trees i looked to see if this oject had landed. There was nothing I could see. It was night and I did not wish to get out and look around.

I was traveling home on the evening of the 16th, and at 6:05 p.m., a light out of the corner of my eye caught my attention.  When I looked up into the sky, just above the woodline, I saw a streak of white light with a greenish tint to it traveling very slow in a northern direction.  There seemed to be broken up in sections, like the lights might have been windows.  I had heard earlier that day that there was a meteor shower scheduled for that evening, so I thought I was seeing one of the meteors.  But it traveled so slowly, so I continued to watch it while driving down this curvy road.  The view of the object was cut-off by the woodline every so often so I couldn&#39;t tell if it was a low flying airplane of some sort.  I&#39;ve been in the reserves for 13 years now and I&#39;ve flown in transport planes and they can fly at a very slow rate also, so my next guess was that, maybe a C-130 or something like that.  I knew that in a moment I would come to a clearing and I would get a good view of the craft, because by the time I came to a curve, the object was completely obscured by the woodline.  When I came to the clearing, which was only 8 seconds from the last time I saw the object, it had vanished.  It was a clear, starlit night.  I heard nothing, but I had the windows up.  There wasn&#39;t any traffic in front of me or behind me during this event.  It wasn&#39;t a reflection of any lights on the inside of the vehicle or the other side of the vehicle.  The craft, or object, was moving ever so slow in the same direction as I went around a few curves.  I&#39;m not a believer in UFO&#39;s, but I don&#39;t renounce them either.  I&#39;m the type of person who has to see it to believe it.  I would like to know what it was though.  I know the heading of the craft is right because the next morning (this morning) I took a compass to the sight and noted my bearing.  Just thought you&#39;d like to know.  Thanks for listening.<n>

Last night around 6:05 pm (central) he was driving home when he saw a streak of light that seemed motionless. He said that if he had measured it in the car window it may have been about 1 1/2 to 2 inches long. He&#39;s not sure about the width as his view was partially obscured from the trees. He noticed it for quite a few minutes from what I gather. He said it didn&#39;t seem to move, in fact it seemed to follow his car. He said it was very bright and was greenish/white in color. He thought he&#39;d get a better view when he came around a curve and it was less wooded. When he did, where this object should have been it was just gone. He slowed down and looked for it but it was gone. I believe he said it was in the western sky.  If it helps, on the map we&#39;re about in the middle of Tennesse, nearly on the TN/KY border. He has asked that our names not be used, just kep confidential to you only. Email if you need to. Thanks.<n>

In my car driving south I see a ball of blue green light coming towards me. I stop my car.This ball stops over the road for 15 to 30 seconds. Then goes east at a very fast speed as it is going off in the distance I can see about 6 to 7 smaller balls comeout of the big one and I type formationand I could see it a very long ways out East then it went almost straight up into the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am a 27 year old Male. I have been running a computer company for 8 years and curent live in a suburb outside of Chicago. I went to Embry-Riddle Flight school were I have got my license to fly aircraft have a few hundred hours of flight time. I understand flight and what it is al about and the concepts of flight.  I have always belived in UFO activity but tonite I am stunned by what I saw. It was approximately 6:05PM CST on 11.16.1999. I was driving SouthBound on Route 59 throught a fairly heavly wooded and dark area. I was talkin on my cell phone to a friend about a program we have been workin on together when all of a sudden I looked up near my rear view mirror ahead of me to see a Greenish Blue ball with a small glow about it it seem to havea slight trail of glowing vapor behind it. Now I have had already been hearing about the metour shower that was expected over the next few days so I was thinking it was a meteor, but I still watched as this object became larger as it aproached my vicenity of where I was. Now I started thinking something was strange as everything around me started getting very bright. The object stopped in  south of me  almost instantly and kind of hovered for about 15 to 30 seconds. It had a blue green color that was an auora to it and a whitish green core to the ball.  I was trying to explain to my friend about what I was seeing but had a hard time explaining.  As I watched the object it started moving east a a quick pace. As it proceeded east now I could see small balls coming out of it and trail directly behind the main ball. It rapidly moved east as could see it for sometime. I could see it glwoing as it went through a small cloud cover and I could then see it going straight upwards. I don&#39;t know how else to explain this han from what I have said about. It is just a strange thing and have felt I need to tell someone about this. Thanks- TG you can contact me by email if your interested in talking to me. However I ahave a busy schedule.<n>

The most interesting quality was the duration and angle of descent.  It seemed like  30-40 degree angle and it was traveling, at what seemed to be a slow speed.  But in actuality, you could see parts of the meteor breaking up.  It was quite beautiful.<n>

It was to the north of us and heading from west to east. At first I thought it was an airplane crashing to the ground.  I was waiting for an explosion.  It never came.  It disappeared beyond the horizon.  Later that night, we heard on the radio that many people had seen it in this area.  From Missouri to Illinois.  I&#39;ve seen meteors and this was no meteor.  I don&#39;t think it was a UFO under anythings control either.  More like space junk.  It was huge and moving slow in a straight line.  Size of a quarter at arms length.  FANTASTIC!  Sparkles emitted.<n>

This object was low and moving in a straight line directly in front of me (south). The distance of first contact to the end of viewing was about 180 degree&#39;s from horizon to horizon, and about 15 to 20 degree&#39;s up. The time envolved with this event was about 10 to fifteen seconds. There were 4 other drivers in the yard that saw this object, and they confirmed what i had seen. The terminal is in open area, with very few obstructions, so we got a very good look at this object.<n>

Shortly after I saw the green fireball moving west to east, I saw 4 more familiar looking meteors, which were very quick streaks of white light which diminished quickly, and they all moving from north to south. The green fireball, moved much slower, in a different direction, and was the same brightness all the while I observed it. I lost sight of it when it was obscured by my neighbor&#39;s house. I thought this object was unusual enough to report since I have never seen anything like it. Other than the above, I really couldn&#39;t give you any more info.

Hurry!&#34; Everyone ran to the front yard where we all (8 people) saw a large light almost as large as my outstretched fist, It was yellow but quickly turned the most brilliant neon green, it had a massive vapor trail behind it.  It was traveling Northeast.  Based on how long it took my husband to call us out and adding the time we watched it it probably glowed for 30 seconds.  As it left our line of sight it seemed to be breaking up small yellow colored sparks seemed to be lagging behind and then fading in brightness until I could no longer see them. Now, we live in Paddock Lake, Wisconsin.  If you check a map that is at the bottom of Wisconsin nearly in Illinois and about 15 miles straight west of Lake Michigan, outside of Kenosha.  I called a friend in Missouri to talk to them about it and the man there had seen the event also a glowing orange turning to yellow headed Northeast and he had enough time to stop his car and point it out to his kids.  He stopped his car thinking it might be something about to crash into the ground and he wanted to get a bearing on where it was headed.  He lives in Cabool, Missouri which is in the middle of nowhere. It couldn&#39;t have taken this object more than a minute to travel 650 miles.  He knows it was about 6PM when he sighted it and they may even make a report today themselves.  That&#39;s all I know.  I have seen LOTS of meteors but honestly none have looked like this. It reminded me of a green glowing fireball video I saw of an object that swept across the western U.S. not so long ago...do you remember that one shot on video and it wasn&#39;t completely dark yet?

I looked out hte window and saw this green and white thing moving across the sky.  We than ran outside and seen the object glowing and looking as if it were going to crash.  The lights than broke up into pieces, the orange and red tail was glowing behind it.  Even though it broke into pieces it still continued to fly in a path.  This is where it picked up speed and disappeared. My husband works in a mill and i make signs for a sign shop.  We did see this thing in the sky.  The both of us had seen the same thing at the same time.  The object was not very high in the sky flying very low .  We know what we saw, we just can&#39;t explain it.<n>

Thought it was a plane crashing.  When it went over the horizon, I waited for the sound of a crash which never came.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I walked outside of my house just before 6:00 pm to walk the dog.  The sky was clear, dark and the air temp cool.  I noticed how starry the night was. About 10 seconds after walking outside I looked up straight up and saw this massive fireball with a long trail behind it.  My first instinct was it was some sort of a jet plane going down.  Although the airport is 5 - 7 miles away, planes from Milwaukee &amp; Chicago fly over my neighborhood on their approach.  This &#34;plane&#34; was coming from what seemed to be SE and headed E/NE.  I thought that if it was a plane, it had taken off from the Madison airport to the SW, encountered problems and continued an arc that brought it E/NE and over my house.  Elevation seemed to be maybe 4000 feet and then as it headed towards the horizon &amp; went over the trees, it looked like it was going to crash on the east side of town or in the village of Cottage Grove. The speed of the object was no faster than a plane making a landing approach.  It moved silently.  When I first noticed the fireball, it was directly overhead.  From that moment until it went over the tree horizon, about 45 seconds to maybe a minute went by.  It was long enough that I contemplated running to my next door neighboor&#39;s house to tell him to come out and watch this. After the object dissapered and I heard no explosion, I went on my walk with the dog (who by the way did not act strange during this event)all the while trying to figure out what I had just seen.  I knew about the upcoming meteor shower, but I thought that 1) it was so huge, I didn&#39;t know meteors looked like that 2) I thought the meteor shower was going to be in the middle of the night.  When I got home, I ran in the house &amp; turned on the local news.  The Channel 3 weatherman was on and talking about the meteor shower.  Since I turned on the TV in the middle of talk, I missed most of what he said.  He was indicating however that the meteor shower was already starting &amp; that was what people were seing.  He said (paraphrased), &#34;we&#39;ve just had several calls about sightings, and that&#39;s what you&#39;re seeing folks - the meteor shower.&#34;  So that did it - I just assumed I saw a meteor. Then last night I turned on Art Bell, because I was curious to hear if he would talk about these impressive meteors.  Boy was I in for a surprise.  When you came on and played the tape from that lady in Northern Michigan, I nearly died.  It was incredibly similar to what I saw.  Like she said, it was moving slow enough to pull over and get out of a car.  Just incredible. To give you a bit of background - although open to the idea of UFOs and such, I have never seen anything which I would describe as unidentifiable until last night.<n>

We watched it as it appeared to bounce over the road and then land in a nearby forest or that was the last place I seen it im not sure if it landed or not.<n>

The streak appeared to be a meteorite at first, because of the upcoming lenoid meteor showers, but it did not lose brilliance or change color as it streaked across the sky. It kept the same speed and shape and color and size as it &#34;flew&#34; from West to East, following the path of I-64/40. The object dissapeared over the horizon after about a minute. It continued through the trees, which was obvious because we could see it.<n>

As we watched the fireball began tilting upward instead of falling and then did a circle and flew towards the southwest.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My parents, and my son and I were driving down Bardstown Rd. heading from our small city of Mt. Washington into the city of Louisville which we are about 10 miles or so south of. We were headed northeast on Bardstown Rd. and my son said look a plane is falling. I looked out the window and immediately got excited because I&#39;ve never seen any type of plane that would be that distance in the sky above appear that large. We are in an airpath that routinely has airplanes fly over our house night and day. We&#39;ve lived in this same house for 23+ years so I know what the normal planes look like in this area. This looked like a big fireball falling from the sky. It was a color of light orange and had like a ripply haze around it. Whethere this haze was the effect of the setting sun or not I can&#39;t be sure. My mother said it looked to her like something out of the movie Armageddon. This fireball was going in a course straight down. My father argued it was just a plane going over the horizon but he could get a proper look at it since he was driving the vehicle. My mother, my son and I continued to watch this fireball spellbound. I can&#39;t say for certain the exact height this fireball was in the sky but I know it appeared to be above where the planes usually fly. If I strectched my arm out the fireball would have been at least the size of my fist. If it was any smaller than that it wouldn&#39;t be by much. Now as I said my father argued it was an aircraft going over the horizon. Keep in mind that it was still daylight here as we were watching this fireball in the sky. The sun was starting to settle in the horizon and the sky was still pretty light. It got dark maybe a half hour or so later. Now as my mother, son and I were watching this fireball go down, i noticed a shift as did both of them. The fireball changed from a falling pattern, went up about a 90 degree angle then it completed a loop and moved off in a southwestern position. We were floored. This fireball was clearing falling straight down and then did what was a! basic l oop and headed a new direction. There were no planes in the area at all either that we could see. Just this lone fireball trailing it&#39;s tail. It was about that time that we went up a hill on Bardstown Rd and around a curve and could no longer see the fireball in the sky. Later this night after we returned back to our home I watched our 11pm news on Channel 11 broadcast from Louisville Ky and found that the story had made the nightly news. They of course reported that it was either a meteor(which there is no way.this thing was way too large) or that it was falling space debree. Since I&#39;ve never seen space debree fall I&#39;ve no idea but space debree doesn&#39;t do loops in midair to any of my knowledge. Also on this newscast on Channel 11 they had a State Trooper from Seymour, Indian on there. He actually got this object on video tape except it was darker when he taped it as he said it was 7:00 PM or so and you can see different colored lights in the fireballs tail. He also said on the news as I told you that he&#39;d never seen anything like it. If I can help with anymore info please contact me. I&#39;m also a commercial artist so if a sketch of this thing and the loop it did would help you let me know and I&#39;ll do one and email it out to you.<n>

I slowed my vehicle and sturned into a parking lot to watch. The object was a brilliant, blue-green fireball. It came from just south of due west, and headed just north of due east. The object was breaking apart and parts were breaking in many directions in back. It appeared to be low in the sky. I had observed the leonids in 98, and this object appeared much more massive, detailed, and took approx 2.5 minutes to arc across the evening sky. I lost sight of the object as it disappeared over the horizon (Lake Michigan.) I returned home in Mequon, called the television station and returned outside. A full ten minutes after the event, two faint, parrallel contrails were still visible from the path the object had followed in the sky..<n>

Evidently, hundreds of people in the Cincinnati area saw the same object, and the incident was reported on the 11:00 news. Object was long with several bright lights which were in a peculiar formation.  Object was first seen through a window of my house.  Upon discovery of object, I hurried out the door and onto the deck which overlooks a lake.  Object seemed to &#34;float&#34; through the air at a relatively slow speed.  There was no audible sound from the object. Although, it was flying at a pretty low altitude, it was difficult to view object in great detail.  I think this was primarily due to the nature of the object itself.  Again, it was a rather long object and maybe can best be described as an abstract &#34;floating train&#34;.  Object was in view for approx. 30-50 seconds all the while traveling at a relatively slow, steady speed.  Then simply disappeared.<n>

From our view this was more like 20 degrees to the horizon, and I had first thought this may have been space debris. With a large meteor in the lead and tumbling smaller pieces trailing, truly an awesome show. But NOT A UFO!<n>

We were traveling east toward Mexico MO and were nearing Rt E on our way to pick up our child from day care when I noticed a bright green object in the sky north of our location.It had a copper-colored tail trailing behind. I asked my husband what it was and he looked and observed the same thing. It was traveling NW to SE at a very rapid pace,and I thought it was going to impact the ground. It then slowed in speed and leveled off having lost it&#39;s tail in the process. It then sped off to the SE and over the horizon. The sky was clear that night, and the humidity level was relatively low. The temperature was mid to lower 50s. My husband is 41 and I am 39. My husband has an Associates degree and works as a machinest for a local university. I have had some college and work as a customer service manager for a restaurant supply company. We are from New Mexico and have lived in Missouri for the last 13 years. We have two children and travel the above route twice a day to work and back.<n>

We thought it was a plane with an engine on fire since we are airport police officers at the Dayton International Airport. The object broke into several smaller white pieces travelling in a straight line approx. west to east.These smaller objects then changed color to a glowing red similar to charcoal embers. The object appeared to be right over the airport. I turned on the ground control radio to listen for any radio traffic about it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We saw the object and thought a plane was in trouble at the airport. We realized it was not a plane but thought it might be a meteor since a shower was expected later that night and the following night. I believe the object fell apart over the airport. The object appeared to be directly over the airport and was travelling at a rather slow speed. A few minutes later someone from Fayette County Emergency Communications Center called our dispatch office and asked if we had a plane go down. They had received several calls about the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note--We believe the witness describes the event of 16NO99.  We have changed the date here.))<n>

I was traveling about 70 MPH and saw this shaped traveling in the sky along side of the car. I thought it was a shooting star, but it didn&#39;t have a tail and it was airborne too long.  It never disappeared in the sky!!!!  As I slowed down, the object got closer and I was able to see it much clearer.  This object had several windows that were seperated by some kind of bar and very bright lights.    I was stunned by what I saw and pulled off the road to get a better look, but The craft disappeared.  My husband said there were several shooting stars and meteors sighted that night and airplanes were chasing the stars, but these were not stars and this was not an airplane.!!!!

Usually a fireworks display rocket is travelling upwards away from sight, but this was verry bright and appeared to be like something was on fire, so bright that it was difficult to tell if it was high in the night sky or low.  It was travelling fast notheast untill it distinguised and was lost in sight.  It also lest a trail of light as it was travelling in a horizontal path, and the light caused a bright line.  My wife and children all witnessed it.  My wife also thought it was some kind of aircraft on fire or so.  I called the police department and they told me no one had reported anything.  I also called Midway Airport and they also had not noticed anything in the sky.<n>

But while I was looking through the binoculars, the lights went out, one by one. There was no sound, and the object looked to be west of Phoenix. I don&#39;t drink or smoke, and I&#39;d never do drugs, so I know I wasn&#39;t imagining things.  I&#39;m not a believer in UFOs, but ((name of investigator deleted)) convinced me to write to this website.<n>

The sparkling fragments traveled Eastward towards me as a whole group. Once the items passed almost overhead and slightly North they took on a greenish-yellow color and appeared to be several fireballs traveling in a train-like fashion. I could not hear any sound from them. They continued to move quickly across the sky and disappeared into the Eastern horizon, slightly North.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was waiting in the drive thru line at the Dairy Queen in Medina Ohio and the passenger with me said &#34;what do we have coming here&#34;? I looked across the vehicle and out the passenger window and noticed what looked to me as fireworks. It was a cold November day and I remember thinking to myself that this was an odd time of the year to see fireworks. The colors were flickering blue and purple and began traveling toward us in a cluster. The two of us were astonished! We both got out of the vehicle and looked toward the colored fragments. As the fragments began to pass overhead they took on a greenish yellow color and appeared to be fireballs with tails traveling in a row. Smaller fire balls could be seen in the tails of the larger fireballs that were in front. They moved swiftly accross the sky and seemed to disappear into the Eastern horizon. Neither of us could believe what we had just seen. There were other customers in line behind us that sort of looked quickly to the sky almost as if they wondered what we were looking at but I don&#39;t believe they acctually saw the fireballs. I was on my lunch break and was angry that I had left my digital camera at work. The image is etched in my mind forever. I saw a brief article on the evening news that someone was calling it space junk and another an asteroid. I heard on the radio that people were calling in reports of a sighting and they were telling us that it was part of the Leonid meteor shower that was due to be seen the following night. This did not occur in the constilation of Leo. I have yet to get any kind of explanation of it. One of my fellow workers told me that his daughter had seen the same event and seemed very puzzled about what she had seen. My work friend told her that it could have been part of the meteor shower but after what I had told him I witnessed, he realy didn&#39;t know what it was. I realy wish I new for sure!<n>

I quickly got up and ran to the east door.  Through the glass door I saw around 5 (white with yellow/orange)balls of light travling in a straight line,directly behind eachother, like slow comets with short wide tails.  The tails were aout twice as long as the objects, and slightly wider.  Each tail stoped before the next object began.  They were decending to the east at an approximate angle of 60 degrees. I called for my daughters and we quickly went outside.  We saw them go down below the tree line toward Lapeer.  They went over my house, to the south.  My wife saw the same thing, she was 10 miles west of us in Flint. I immediately called the police.  They received several calls, including the flight administration saying a plane went down.  This was no airplane or meteor.  There were no flames, only a strange, plasma like tail that disipated. I heard no sound.<n>

Fireball (short tail &amp; enormous vapor trail).<n> <n><n> <n><n> Appeared at the western horizon similar to a helicopter light , bright but with an orange glow. As the object crossed from west to east it appeared to narrowly miss a plane , on its landing path into Chicagos O&#39;hare Airport , about 30 degrees on the horizon. On approach it was obvious it was not a helicopter or headlight on an airplane. Its appearance was that of a fireball. It had a greenish metalic core surrounded by an orange glow. It could have been flaming except it did&#39;nt have a flaming tail but it did leave an extremely large vapor trail in its wake. My second thought was a meteor but the size of it (a dime held at arms length) I was waiting for a catastrophic explosion similar to when the dinosaurs became extinct but that did&#39;nt happen. Ther were four small 24 carot gold colored objects following directly behind it changing positions with each other rather than falling like a spark would. This object or objects passed overhead from horizon to horizon in approximately 10 seconds. It did not fall from the sky but flew from west to east.<n>

It also hovered and then went forward very slowly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At 14:00 on November 16th, my wife and I were going west on James River Expressway just past Glenstone Boulervard in Springfield, Missouri when to the north, at a distance of less than 1/4 od a mile, we observed an unidentified flying object at less than 1000 feet in altitude that was hovering. It was a cylinder shape, with no lights. The best way to expalain it is a jet airliner fuselage with no wings, no windows, no tail and no visible means of propulsion.We pulled off of the shoulder and other cars slowed down to see the event. It hovered for three minutes, then went slowly to the east at approximately 100 miles an hour. It made no sound,and had no contrails. After about four minutes, it sped up and then vanished out of sight. The day was perfectly clear.20 minutes later, going south on 160, we observed 4 fighter jets in loose formation going northeast toward Springfield. They appeared to be F4 Phantom jets, perhaps from Little Rock Air Force Base or maybe a base out of Oklahoma.I don&#39;t know if these jets are related to the first event. I know one thing, my wife is buying me a camcorder for Christmas to carry in the car after this event.<n>

The object had no appendages except for a slight dome on top which appeared which less reflective or more translucent than the rest of the craft. Having flown and soloed in aircraft ( but never completed enough hours for a private rating ) before, I would estimate its altitude as somewhere around 5,000 feet, its airspeed between 100-125 knots, and its distance from me possibly 3-5 miles. Although I didn&#39;t have time to look around while driving, I&#39;m sure others must have seen this incredible sight too.<n>

As we kept driving closer to it, the object was just motioneless and hoering over the tree tops to our left off the freeway. It was no more than a block or so off the side of the freeway. As we kept driving we got to see a side view and if I recall I think I saw a faint green light at the opposite end of the 3 white lights, I was driving so I was unable to keep a steady watch. Me and my passenger knew it was NOT a meteor as I saw one the night before and could not have been a plane as it did not have red or blue blinking lights and was not in that shape. Shape was approximatley a V shape to a triangle. this at my guess lasted for about 4 minutes. As we kept driving my passenger looks back and was able to still keep it in sight. When I was returning back about a 1/2hr later I looked for the object but it was no where to be seen.<n>

The flashes of light were so bright that I thought something big had to be happening.  There were 2 distinct instances of the bright light.  The first one flashed about 3 times, then there was a period of  about 30 seconds went by and then another eposide came again.  I got up and looked out my window and there was noting to look at.  The light shined through my south window. I just happened to find this UFO sight.  I entered bright shinning light into the search engine and there was a sight telling about the light that I saw too.  Just to let you know...<n>

I live in an apartment complex. My place is by the street, but normally, cars that pass during the night have a much fainter brilliance from the headlight, and it lasts longer.  This time it was just a brilliant and quick flash of light. The night sky is very clear.  I&#39;m very close to Mather AFB, now closed.  There was no sound.<n>

It was many times brighter than Venus can be,and it waxed and waned in intensity over the course of 20 minutes.  There was also some faint reddish light.  It moved slowly toward the south covering approximately 45 degrees of the horizon.  A small plane flew nearby and the light of the plane was nothing similar to this light.  This light did not have a regular strobe like an aircraft and there was no sound.  At one point near the end, its intensity decreased to about that of the surrounding stars, then slowly increased back to its original intensity.  We finally lost sight as it went into the distance and trees obscured it.<n>

Apprx. 23:00 i was driving my son home from some school function and I we were about 1/2 mile from our home I noticed some werid lights in the sky.  It was just before 8:00 p.m. and was compleletly dark out. I noticed them because they were so low to the ground.  I kept driving toward my home and pointed them out to my 12 yr old son and said to him &#34;what the heck is that&#34;?  He said what I guess all 12 yr olds would say &#34;I dunno know&#34; &amp; went back to the radio.  As I proceeded up our street I kept saying what the heck is that.  In the late 80&#39;s I lived next to a US Marine air base and helicopters were always flying overhead.  I dont mean the little news helipcopters but the but huge kind.  Super Stallions and some other kind.  Anyways, I first thought that it was a helicopter cause these werid lights where just hovering.   But I would be dammed if I couldnt hear the helicopter.  Once thing I remember about those big helicopters is you can hear them and feel them when they fly that low to the ground. I couldnt get a good fix on the shape of these lights because of trees and homes, but about 30-40 yards from my home I got a very very close look at this &#34;thing&#34;.  I stopped the car, but kept the engine running and opening the window and I couldnt hear a thing, nothing silence except for the neighborhood dogs barking.  The object was no particular shape.  The closest we could come up with was the lights made it look like the letter &#34;T&#34; upside down. I turned the radio off and still nothing but silenec. By now my son, but now gave his full attention to this thing. We stared at this thing and we both remarked that it was nothing like we ever saw before.  My son kept saying it had to be a helicopter.  We were looking toward the northeast approx. 100 yards away from us and was flashing colored lights in not particular sequence.  After apprx 5 minutes a section of this &#34;thing&#34; separated from itself and kep! t hoveri ng while the main section took off in the sky toward the east.  Then after a moment or two the smaller of now 2 sections took off after the larger section.  We took on after it  and watched it move very fast across the sky and out of our vision.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

I was looking skywards to observe a flock of geese flying overhead.  Just above the geese was a sphere that appeared to be about the size of a two story house.  If it were not for the geese I would not have seen the object because it was very stealthy.  It was afternoon near sunset and I could see the golden glow of the sun and the horizon reflected on the side of the sphere.  I must say it was beautiful and it seemed to be a very sophisticated object.  I was never quite sure of the existance of ufos or alien technology, but having actually seen one so clearly, I am now somewhat disappointed in the government&#39;s lack of informing its citizens of the reality of such craft.  It flew quickly, left no contrail and was silent.  I will never forget it as long as I live.<n>

No other objects in sky whatsoever.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I and a friend were car pooling to our job from Edina to Roseville, Mn. Heading north  on Hwy 35w. I noticed it first and was unsure of what I was seeing. I wached it for about 3-4 minutes w/o saying anything so that I could be sure. The sky was completely clear. The weather was crisp and slightly cold. It was low in the sky (say about the size of a pen point at first sighting and as we drew closer by about 10 miles about the size of a pencil eraser at arms length). It was a very dark color...Gray bordering on black. At first it had definite edges. It reflected light at the edges. It stayed in one spot, seemingly motionless. I mentioned to my friend after a few minutes who is a skeptic and asked him, &#34;What the h*ll is that?&#34;.  He didn&#39;t know either.  By the time we were as close to it as we were going to get it had dissipated into a cylinder shaped &#34;cloud&#34; or &#34;mist&#34; and was losing shape slowly. My father being a pilot I grew up around airports, airplanes and airshows and have always kept an eye to the sky. I have never seen anything like it. If it was a &#34;cloud&#34;, why would one tiny, dark cloud form in a sky barren of any other weather formations? My friend was a little bothered by it and chalked it up to weather. I&#39;m not so sure.<n>

It was as big a a very large house would be and perfect in shape and whitish in color.   It was as if someone took paint brushes and painted a perfect circle in the sky and just left it there.    And at one point I thought it might be con trails that just came together in a perfect circle but that would be hard to do.   I have been a pilot and know that it would be impossible.     I watched it for some ten minutes and then it was just gone.   There was no sound to it at all and at that time of the morning there was no one out that I could see to confirm this with someone else.   It has taken me so long to report this but I was away from home and didn&#39;t return until this evening. And there seemed to be some light going around the object but they seemed to blend into the object.<n>

We noticed these two red lights moving from South to North, but could not see any shape of an aircraft with the lights.  The lights were very odd.  They looked diffused.  We had to keep re-focusing on them to keep them in sight even though they were directly overhead and not that far away.  We estimate the lights at an altitude of 10,000 to 20,000 feet based on the planes that were in the sky at that time.  We live about 24 miles from O&#39;Hare airport in Chicago. At any given time, we can see at least a dozen planes in the sky.  The sky was perfectly clear.  The strangest thing was the lack of any sound and the way the lights appeared.  Lights from other planes in the sky at the time were sharply visible.  These were fuzzy. Both my wife and I have college educations and have been in the business world for decades.<n>

As it reached about 2-o&#39;clock it faded away quicky as if some one just turned it off.  It was a very bright round white light that was constant.  There were no other lights.  There was no sound. The snaking motion or wobble, was very distinctive and could not have been a plane as there were no other lights or sound.

The Contrail on the west was a standard straight line. The contrail on the east was the so called &#34;donuts on a rope&#34; ,or &#34;Aurora&#34; type. They were spotted within high cirrus cloud formation. Sorry, no pix.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Not much more to report. Contrails were white in color, appeared to not have much distance between them ( 1/2 mile perhaps ), were very visible and stable for as much as 40 minutes. My wife and I observed this from our back yard. We both have prior experiences with unexplained phenomena.<n>

A bright white light appeared in the sky and we watched it for several minutes. We were unsure if it was a bright star or an airplane&#39;s landing lights..but it didn&#39;t twinkle like a star and seemed to hover and move side to side ways and exhibited strange characteristics unlike any other light source...natural or man-made. It was easy to see it was imminating from the bottom of the object since the glare was directed downward. As we questioned it&#39;s origins it responded by gyrating in circles...kind of like a spinning top when it starts to wobble. Then like a flash the object responded to our curiosiy in it&#39;s size and in an instant went from being a bright light in the distance to a large craft(maybe a half mile in diameter)...it is at this point that I grabbed my girlfriend and started to run like hell! Terrified I turned to look over my shoulder, at the same time the Craft jumped back up into sky and dissapeard behind some clouds. As I looked over my shoulder one last time I saw the same bright white light popping in and out from behind some clouds. We got in the car and started home...but our curiosity got the best of us and we went back to see if it was still there.  When we returned the sky was very dark...we could hear a very lo pitched hum and smelled an odd burning scent like fuel but not gasoline. We were so terrified we haven&#39;t been back since. What was this?? PLEASE HELP!<n>

At the end of that time it simply disappeared.  There was no cloud cover and the sky (barring normal light polution from Dallas) was as clear as it gets in this area.  It&#39;s outline was made up of six lights.  I live near the Addison airport and I&#39;ve seen many airplanes in the sky.  However, every airplane I&#39;ve seen has lights that are flashing.  This thing did not.<n>

Sever minutes later, I observed three more in a triangle form like you would see if fighter planes were in a flanking position.  There was one bright light that remained stationary for about twenty minutes.  Then the bright white light started doing eliptical patterns.  Then as I look to observe the first object, it was doing eliptical patterns in the opposite directions as the bright light.  All that I saw was recorded by time in a notebook and I even mapped out the things I saw. The bright white light at two different times emmitted a white light and a red light that went away from it and went out of view.<n>

It was night, and very cold.  We decided to wrap ourselves in a pile of blankets and watch the characteristic &#34;smoke&#34; enter the valley below.  As the mist covered the city, and all we could see was ambient light, our gaze shifted upward to the stars. At first, we thought that what we saw was simply a star until it moved in a triangular pattern.  It was a red/blue light that was about 4-5 miles away, high above the city below.  Scared, we ran to our car for shelter.  Our two dogs that we had with us suddenly became silent....and believe me they had been fussing most of the night until this light appeared. Once inside the car, another light, yellow and green hovered to the west of where we were looking.  This was about 500 yards away.  It hovered behind the treeline and then above it.  It moved in the same triangle pattern as the other light.  We locked the doors and watched for about 3-4 hours more before passing out of exhaustion.  I do recall feeling like my mind was being read, and as I thought this my friend asked me if I felt as though I were being scanned. WE WERE NOT ON DRUGS AND ARE BOTH CHRISTIANS BUT I MUST SAY THAT THIS EVENT HAS HAUNTED ME EVER SINCE.  WE NEVER SPEAK OF THIS INSTANCE SINCE WAKING IN THE EARLY DAWN.  WE CONFRIMED OUR SIGHTING TO EACH OTHER AND THEN DROPPED IT. My research has uncovered the mystery surrounding the &#34;Brown Mountain Lights&#34; that US Geological teams have investigated with NO results. What the hell were these lights?????<n>

I continued over these tracks, at the time thinking this was just a low flying private airplane concerned about the bad weather.  At the time there were tornado warnings broadcasted throughout the area, mostly cottage countries...<n> <n><n> <n><n> However, it seemed to me that these two white lights were stationary as I headed towards them.  While I came between the 100 or so meters between my car and the object which separated us, I realized that this craft was indeed hovering in its position.................<n> <n><n> <n><n> now it is for real...<n> <n><n> <n><n> i hate sceptics... i lost sight of this craft while I turned a corner on my incline up the escarpment... the trees were too high for me to see the thing... but once I reared the corner, I saw It in all of Its glory... OMG.. it had just finished turning around in a 180 degree fashion.. umm.. i crept up slowly.. it was right above my head and it travelled a speed of less than 10 K/M per hour...<n> <n><n> <n><n> I ducked my head out of the window and i noticed it made no sound at all.. fear.. fear is all i felt and i entered my car again and left the scene.. I wish I stayed longer to see what the craft would do, but I fled in fear.. fear.. fear....<n> <n><n> <n><n> I can draw exactly what this craft looks like.. there was only 50 feet or less between my eyes and the machine itself.. it has an elongated cockpit with a couple of mini wings on either end behind the standard cockpit seat... then there is an outstretched wingspan with a concave ending.. the tips of the wings have bright white lights upon them.. the underside of the craft is unmarked.. there are two rows of lights here, not as bright as the wing tips..   one side is red, the other green.. i do not remember which is where.. there was also some sort of bay door on the underside of the craft..... I was directly below this....  I dont know if they took me or not...<n> <n><n> <n><n> I would really appreciate however, if anyone has seen this aircraft.. I hear it can fly away at super speeds, something I did not stay around to witness.. I can draw exactly what this thing is.. if I had a camera...

Visible until disappeared on horizon<n> <n><n> <n><n> Travelling from Cheney to George, Wa, I was awakened by my stepfather (who was driving) at approximately 12:45 a.m.  He said jokingly that there was a UFO outside my window.  A bright blue-white flashing object appeared coming from the west, parallel to the freeway. I estimate it was 2000-4000 above us, moving at barely subsonic speed.  There were no green or red marking lights, only the flashing light.  As it went nearly directly overhead, each time it flashed, I could make out the shape of the craft.  The flash came directly from the center of mass of the object.  The easiest way to describe it is to (no joke) start with a mental picture of the Batman searchlight image, then make the &#34;wings&#34; a little thinner and angle them back another 20-30 degrees.  There appeared to be a pointed projection where the &#34;head&#34; would be and it continued towards the rear like half of a pencil thin fuselage might be attached to the integral &#34;wings&#34;.  Then halfway out, on each side were similar projections, front and rear of the &#34;wings&#34; and again at the tip.  I think there were 5 in all: one center, two midway, two at tips. The brightness was such that it would be equivalent to several parking lot searchlights combined: several million candlepower!  We joked about it for 30 seconds or so, I looked out the back window, and it flashed brightly until it disappeared below the horizon to the east.  Presumably it was headed for the air force base near Spokane.  There must have been others that noticed it, as there was still quite a bit of traffic on the freeway.  We heard nothing, but at 75 mph, wind noise is significant.  The abscence of normal marker lights was strange. I am a soil scientist.  I read quite a bit and know a little bit about aircraft-not too much.  This did not look quite like the &#34;flying wing&#34; (B-something or other) that is commonly talked about.  Maybe other descriptions will help you piece this puzzle together.  Hope this helps.  This is my first report, but not first sighting.<n>

Moved, then became stationary.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This location is just east of Sacramento, CA. Just about 2 or so miles south of Highway 50, on Latrobe Rd. It is in the foothills, and very rural. The stars show brightly. I would be happy to draw a picture for you if you are interested. Looking south, the moon was very round and bright. I looked up and saw a bright star-like object with a fire colored tail moving to the right of the moon. I called two other people out of the building and by the time they got there the fire had gone out. The light continued to move to the right and downward. It stopped at about &#39;3 or 4 inches&#39; from the moon and stayed there for at least 2 hours. I work graveyard, and I had just arrived at work, so I know the time is correct. I came out on my first break at 12:00am, and the light was still there. I know next to nothing about stars etc. but it seems there is usually one in that position. However, we did see this light move rapidly down to that position. I&#39;ve been noticing little things up there over the past few months, but I attributed them to my eyes playing tricks. This, however, was no trick of the eye. I thought it was just one of the meteors that I&#39;d read about and heard Art talking about, but it stopped dead still, so I just thought I&#39;d mention it!<n>

One of them pointed to an area of the sky and said &#34;What is that?&#34;  We all looked and saw what appeared to be 3 smallish objects flying in very tight formation.  The objects emitted no sound at all, and it was difficult to judge the altitude because none of the objects had any lights whatsoever.  Only the light pollution from the city illuminated them.  They flew very quickly from east to west.<n>

I was at a spiritual retreat on an approximately 5 acre site owned by a 1st presbeterian church. the moon had already set. I was with two other men.  then there was this bright flash, like a camera flash going off. very similar to it since it was that quick strobe like effect and once.  I turned my head enough to see the source in my side vision. the source was too big to have been a meteor.  it was too short to have been a flare and I know since I&#39;ve done sailing before and seen flares shot from ships. the flash lit up the entire country side.  The two men both saw it as well and didn&#39;t know what it was. there was no sound associated with it. later that evening, high winds and heavy fog rolled in that was gone before the next day. I worried a bit about my friend&#39;s father.  My friend often has unexplained nosebleeds but does not know what he thinks about ufos, whether to believe or not.  his father claims to have seen one at one time in his military service and he lived not 10 minutes from where I was. My father and I both have very bad headaches tonight (11/14/19 ~2100) and I have not seen him in at least three days so it is unusual for them to hit us both with no common precursors, though I do not know if that has anything to do with the UFO or the general supernatural forces that often surround us. I was asked to report to this site by a man named David who was also at the retreat with me.<n>

I am a truck driver and was returning from a run and was near Moorehead KY when I observed what appeared to be a bright star at first glance.  However, being fairly familiar with the stars I knew this wasnt one.  This object appeared in the ENE sky at about the 1:00 position on the horizon.  It started as very bright, and then dimmed until it had disappeared, and continued on this cycle for about 3 minutes.  At the dimmest, it was not visable, however at the brightest, it appeared to be a greenish color, almost neon bright.  Then the object moved across the horizon to the WNW horizon, leaving a tail such as a comet would, then stopping and proceeded to repeat the cycle of dim to bright.  After about 3 minutes at this position, it returned to its origional position, repeated the cycle, then disappeared.  I can not say for sure this was a ufo, or what it was, however I do beleive I know what it was not.  I am sure it was not a star or any visable planet, and I am reasonably sure this was no military aircraft.  Anyway, I thought you may want to check this out.  Sorry, no photos were taken as no camera was available.<n>

I didn&#39;t give much thought to seeing a shooting star, as I have seen many before.  Suddenly, some motion in the sky to my left and towards the front of the house caught my eye.  As there is a streetlight there I could not quite see clearly with the artificial light as four sphere shaped objects came into view.  Once they were above me I could see them against the background of the clear night sky without the contaminating light from the street.  Three of the objects were traveling in a tight, equilateral triangle formation, as the fourth traveled behind and perhaps two to three times the distance between the objects in the triangle formation.  I am an empirical person, and I attempted to explain away to myself these objects as something else, but found that I could not as I watched them until they disappeared over the trees.  I can not be sure what the altitude of these objects was, but they seemed to be fairly close to the earth.  Due to the fact that they were only visible to me (from horizon to horizon) for about 5-10 seconds, I tend to think that these objects were traveling at a fairly low altitude.  These objects emanated a slightly bluish-white aura, yet also appeared to have a dull, metallic appearance to them that seemed to reflect light coming from the earth rather than emitting any themselves.  They did not appear to be all that large.  I watched closely to see if there would be any variance in the symmetry of the triangle formation and noticed none, except for the fact that the triangle seemed to &#34;flatten,&#34; maintaining the perfect equilateral formation yet appearing the way that it should have relative to my viewpoint.<n>

A few minutes after the last of the boats seemed to be away from the storm, my friend said &#34;look a flare&#34; we thought a boat was in trouble, my friend who first spotted it said it came up from the water so we thought it was a flare. It was red, It stood still about 2 klms out to shore, it kind of sat there for about 30 seconds to 1 minute then did little zig zags then it went up on about 45 degree angle then flew a straight line until it went out of sight behind the nrth cliff of the beach yet it was still a fair distance away, the cliff just obstructed our view. We were excited as 2 of us believed in ufo&#39;s and the other 2 do/did not yet we could&#39;nt explain anything that flew that way or at that speed. After about 5 mins of shaking excitment we decided to go back to our campsite as we got up and turned around, there it was only this time the red light was flashing on and off as it seemed to be resting on top of the mountain/hill approximately 600 metres in front of us, then we noticed it was not resting it was hovering and slowly ducking behind the mountain/hill as we screamed out in excitment to the 5th person in our party, funny enough it&#39;s haze could barely be seen once he joined us. He kind of riddiculed us but we were shaking uncontrollably so I guess he kind of believed our story. It even seemed as though it did&#39;nt want him to see it cause the second he joined us you could barely make it out. We are no longer in contact with him anyway. The next morning my friend who did&#39;nt believe in ufo&#39;s (which to me gives the story credability b&#39;cause I know too much of these things to have u believe me, as my mother is an active speaker in this country on ufo phenomena and even regresses abductees) said &#34;I had a dream about those aliens last night&#34; I jokingly replied &#34;then you were abducted b&#39;cause abductions usually flash back as though it were a dream&#34;, what threw me is that she then said &#34;then you were abducted too b&#39;cause you were on board the ship with us&#34; Well that gave me the chills and I asked her to tell me all about her dream.....which sounded to me like a classic abduction but I don&#39;t know if u r interested in that part of the story, but to me it&#39;s the most important cause she described things that I knew others had described in other abduction cases yet I was&#39;nt the one that remembered it was the non believer who had no knowledge of abduction case histories. I was carefull not to feed her information as I have knowledge of people who are drama queens and make these things up. And I really wanted to hear if she spoke of things she had noway of knowing such as the appearance of the tall blonde female, who showed us writing that made no sense to us, on a board, yet we were shown this for some reason my friend said. She, my friend said the boys, (our boyfriends) were not with us it was just us 3 girls.<n>

11/12/99 19:00|Denver|CO|Rectangle|1-2 mins.|Something(s) rising behind me as I was driving home from work.|11/17/99|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/010/S10733.html|354|ndxe199911| Something(s) rising behind me as I was driving home from work.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Within 2 miles from home driving back from work on Florida Avenue, I noticed in my rearview mirror a bright white rectangular light about the intensity of a street lamp at a distance of 50 feet directly to the east.  It appeared to be rising over Ruby Hill Park directly behind me. I say rising because I was descending the hill and it appeared to &#34;peek&#34; up over the crest of the hill directly behind me in line with the street as I continued away from it.  It could not have been a car, however, as it continued to appear to rise above the level of the street even at the top of the hill, though that thought initially crossed my mind.  I had never noticed such a light at that location behind me, but thought perhaps I had just been inattentive previously not to notice. As I continued, two more appeared to rise above the hill flanking the first one so they appeared to be in a triangular formation behind the first one from my vantage point.  Since they had the brightness of a street lamp, I thought that was what they were.  However, the street lamps at distances much nearer faded from view due to their lack of strength and the edges that direct the light downward as I drove away from them.  I also thought they could be lights on top of tall buildings that were there and I had never noticed, or were being built, but the direction I was viewing has no such construction taking place, nor does it have any tall buildings. I pulled into a filling station to get gas, then thought I would try to look for them again later that evening, as I had plans to go out with some friends.  However, I was in the back seat and did not think to look for them the rest of that night.  The next night, though, I looked for them and they were not there!  Additionally, the part of the city I could normally see was occluded while those lights were there.  This would lead me to believe that the 3 lights were not just separate lights, but were actually part of one large craft.  But I really have no idea what they or it was.  I have just not seen it since. A few more facts:  the rising action stopped and the object(s) seemed to be stationary once I saw all three.  The rising action could have even been an illusion because the land begins to rise a mile or so west of Ruby Hill.  I might note, however, that I was only about a quarter of a mile beyond the hill when I started to notice the first one.  They were not following me, nor were they moving in any direction like a plane or jet.  The light quality seemed to be gas lights of some sort, but much brighter proportionately.  The object(s) were probably a distance of 4 to 10 miles, depending on how big they really were.  I don&#39;t know why I was so casual about the whole thing, but I just felt it was an interesting phenomenon.  I had had three previous sightings which were much more interesting.  One of them was chronicled here about a year ago.<n>

It had two halves,divided by light ( I never saw them separate though)and it had a glow around it, not really a glow, there just seemed to me to be no sharp edge. The whole unit glowed light orange.Each halves (as I looked through Binoculars) apeared to have tubes that slightly resembled viens running along them. We got the call from a neighbor down the street to check out our back door and see what was out there. We all went out(8 of us) looked south and saw it perfectly still in the sky. (remember it is 5pm and it is still light out!!! We stood there watching it till we got cold(mid november)then everyone went in the house, I grabbed a coat and went back outside,but it was gone, I was so disappointed!!!<n>

At first I thought it was the helicopter for the near-by hospital but then I realized that it wasn&#39;t any helicopter and wasn&#39;t like any kind of plane I have ever heard of.  It was long and had several lights (I think three and I know that the end lights were colored differently)  As I moved I realized that the object was not moving at all.  I on several occasions went by groups of trees that blocked my view but when I got pass them the object was still there.  I came to a corner and turned in the direction of the object to see it better and it was gone. I have to say that this did not look like some kind of alien spacecraft---like I would know (ha!) But it didn&#39;t look like a plane or helicopter either.<n>

The object was approximately 40&#39; above the horizon. The object was in my sight for only about 3 to 4 seconds but it was traveling at a high rate of speed ( faster than an F16 on a strafing run ) and then disappeared like a shooting star burning out. In structure the object appeared to be a tight cluster (3 or 4 )of extremely bright red and orange lights. The night was clear and cool and if I remember correctly little or no moon. Sighting took place in a suburban area.

ANGELS AND UFOS!<n> <n><n> <n><n> On 11-11-1999 I went outside to look at the sunset, as I did I saw luminous patches of sky. I went inside to get the 35 mm camera. I came outside and took some shots of the bright lights in the sunset. Now these lights were more like pieces of sky, like sheets. I quickly ran out of film so I went inside to get the videocamera. When I came bacl out there was a sphere type ufo over my neighbors house in the distance. I started to film. While I was filming it another ufo appeared in the frame from nowhere. It appears as a small dot and grows ito a cigar shaped ufo, clouded or encased in mist. The Cigar and the sphere are under fire. There are small  very fast moving spheres running from right to left perfectly horizontal. The two ships fire a weapon at these ultra high speed spheres. Now, these spheres were not visible to the naked eye, only visible when the tape is played back and only clear in a frame by frame view. The  cigar ship that is above and to the left of the atationary sphere spits out a long silver thread shimmering like snail trails. then the snail trail blows up to become another ship. The three form an isoceles triangle. The two cigar ships are changing color from green to red. Upon close examination of the avi file you can see the ship change color as it charges it&#39;s weapon the green flashes are charge up and the red is discharge. Remember I have the videotape proving every word I write. The craft fires a green plasma ball. The green balls of energy deflect the ultra high speed spheres the spheres come in two colors black and white. After a few moments of shooting like crazy the amount of ultra fast spheres decrease. Then Huge patches of a Luminous substance is manifested right out of thin air. These patches are like the ones I first took the photos of. Then several large patches of Luminous &#34;Stuff&#34; gets sucked into the bottom of the extraterrestrial craft from the bottom. Now you must think I am making this up. But I have the tape. It was made with my Son and my Daughter present. In the middle of the tape my wife comes home from work and finds us on the porch with the camera. This is not a joke! This is the most seious footage that has even been acquired. You can see stills here:((URL deleted)) Theere you will also find a copy of the letter sent to the President and Vice President as wellas to all 100 U.S. Senators. These craft have the ability to appear out of nowhere. They do it without warning. They are laying down suppressive fire during some type of extraction process. They are performing some unknown business in our atmosphere. This is an EXTREMELY BIG deal. BUT! If you don&#39;t come to my aid, by viewing and questioning and doing your part. The extraterrestrials that so want to meet us will be even further delayed. It&#39;s that simple! When will we be ready! If you are ready write me. We here in New Jersey need to fight for recognition of this reality. I have the undisputable daylight video! On 12-13-99  ((deleted)) news is coming over to film the area in preparation for a live broadcast on Thursday. The Senior Correspondent is ((name deleted)), and he will be doing the interview. Stand Tall Folks, now is the time. I have had this footage for some days now and it has modified my perspective as it has to ALL who have seen it! The video trancends language and speaks to the higher self of every individual. Now yes those who would believe nothing will not believe this either, but that will make it easier for you to push them away before the explode and get you all messy. Those who doubt will be swayed by this. But those who actively participate in diss- information, and in just being an eternal detractor will be destroyed by this tape. This tape &#34;IS&#34; the truth. The &#34;TRUTH&#34; is no longer out there, it&#39;s in you and this tape will bring it out! And allow you to have pride in your inner knowlege. Knowing without proof is faith but knowing with proof is cake! Throwing away things that are &#34;NOT&#34; cake....well in that there can be no loss when the rest is all cake! I hope you can understand that. I am:  ((Name deleted)) {Woodbridge} NJ Pax Humana<n>

Instead a vapor trail, orange in color, rose in the sky and leveled out heading east. The trail remained the same size, when it was overhead I saw that there was a round object at the head and noticeably separated from the trail. I photogaphed it with my digital work camera (I am a newspaper photographer). It was probably a jet or something like that, but so unusual looking. I can send an image if you would like to see it. My brother thinks its a jet.  .<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I left work around 10 miutes to five today, November 11, 1999. I noticed a trail in the sky to the west, in the directon that we usually see the Vandenburg launches, and that was what I thought it was. It was still light out, but getting dark. The vapor trail seemed to rise but never got any longer. It headed toward me, to the east. The color was orange. I thought well maybe I should photograph this, so I  my camera out of the truck and took some pictures as it came toward me, as it became level with me I could see from the ground with just my eyes that here was a round object ahead of the vapor trail, and separated from by a distance about the same sizes the round object. The trail and object looked at arms length to be about 4-5 inches long. The picture clearly shows the gap. Does a jet plane have a gap behind it and the trail? If so I guess it could be a jet, the color  the trail, very distinct. Could it be caused by the sun angle, sun was below the horizon I think. Anyway, color was unusual and certainly round shape unusual. Would the roundness be another bit of work by the sun angle? I have a picture if you think it is worthy of further study I can send it.<n>

The elevation was 4100 feet.  We had just passed a sign, so that is how I know it was that elevation.  I was driving, and something made me look to the sky above the mountains to my in a Northwest direction - I think it was the movement in the sky.   I was surprised to see something that was clearly not a plane because it had no wings or tail, no lights, and no trail behind it.  It looked like a silver metallic cigar-shaped craft that with rounded edges, and was larger at one end (the left as I was looking at it) than the other.  I could not see if it had windows, but it was very large.  I am not a pilot so have no reference for size, but my guess is that it was quite a bit larger than an airplane. The object was moving very slowly from North to South just above the peak of a mountain.   It would periodically slow down and then speed up.  I said to my friend a couple of seconds after I first sighted it - &#34;((name deleted)), what the heck is that?&#34;  To which she replied that she had no idea, and that she had already been watching it for at least 1 - 1 1/2 minutes and was trying to figure that out herself.  She kept thinking (and hoping) it would show some wings or something to indicate that it was a plane.  We both got very excited and said &#34;oh my God, I think it is a UFO&#34; at the same time! At that point I looked at my watch to verify time, and it said 4:20 PM.  The sun was setting in the West, and it caused the craft to shine quite brightly.  We were behind a mountain at the time, so the sun was not shining in our eyes.  I did look for signs for some reference as to the exact point, but there were none around.  There are quite a few mountains in this area.  We both watched the object for approximately 30 seconds, and were discussing it when it took a 90-degree turn very quickly due West, became transparent, and then disappeared.  ((Name deleted)) did not witness it becoming transparent first, only that it disappeared instantly.  We believe she must have blinked during this time because that is how fast it occurred.  I then pulled over on the side of the road and grabbed my camera and video camera in case it came back, because at that point I was convinced that I saw something otherworldly or perhaps an experimental craft of some type. We both remarked how it began to move away as we were talking about it.  We then kept looking to see if we would see anything further, or perhaps see planes in the area that would indicate a flight line to or from an airport, but saw nothing until we reached the San Diego Area.  We saw no planes or helicopters whatsoever going to or from El Centro at all once we reached the mountains.  We are from the Midwest and are unfamiliar with mountains, but perhaps a topographical map would indicate the tallest one (the one we were on) for a better reference. ((name deleted)) had never seen a UFO in her life (she is now 53), and is convinced that this was a UFO.  I should also mention that ((name deleted)) was driving first, and then I got very sick and made her let me drive to minimize the sickness.  I do get carsick, but this time was probably the worst I&#39;ve ever felt.  Also, about 10 minutes after the sighting, I was compelled to pull off to the side of the road to collect rocks two times.  The second time, we pulled 100 feet behind a stalled van, and right as I returned to the car I looked in the rear view mirror and saw a semi truck cab driving at around 90 MPH on the side of the road straight for us.  Just before it would have hit us, it swerved back onto the highway.  I have the overwhelming feeling that that was a message of some sort.<n>

In a heavily populated area..  For the north about 30,000 at the time I guess.  I had gone to the store for a walk mostly.  And I heard the neighbors dog whining and whimpering.  I had taken one route to the store, (a lady from the block let me cut through her yard as long as I didn&#39;t break anything) and cut back through an empty lot to get to my street.  That&#39;s when the dog started freaking out barking at something else.  There was a pile of old telephone poles at the end of this street and it was already pretty dark out.  And u seen it crouched over between these power poles and the fence of my neighbor two doors down..  I didn&#39;t know what it was, I was uneasy.  I think I surprised it or something because my legs were wanting to run but I froze.  The minute I thought about running it looked at me and came up to the edge of the power poles..  Leering over the top of them.  I only caught a glimpse of a..  Heart shaped head..  Sort of. With big eyes.  Just looking at me.  I&#39;m not sure what happened but I felt fear, like it meant me harm.  Then the two neighborhood dogs started snapping like when you walk by their yard.  Defensively and I ran..  It pursued me to the end of the lot.  I ran home to and locked every door behind me.  A few minutes later the dogs stopped barking all together for a few hours.  Like a wolf was just around or something..<n>

The event happened around 6:10 p.m. on 11/10/99. I was driving in a valley between two ridge tops in a heavily wooded area (Hillsboro-House Springs Road). This area has no streets lights of any kind and there is farmland in the valley between the two ridge tops. On my left there was a break in the ridge, and a light (almost moon size) was hovering stationary to the left of the break. I rolled down the window and stopped the car on the road. There was no audible sound coming from the light. Shortly thereafter, a car was coming up behind me so I proceeded forward. The light moved at a very quick speed horizontally to the right (about 15-20 degrees). I lost sight of it after that due to trees obstructing my view. The total event time of the sight of the light was about 1 minute. The only other sighting I have had was in 1976(?). This involved several traveling red glowing objects, observed while going down the Mississippi River on the ship the Admiral. I was not the only person on board that saw them. ship the Admiral<n>

It was stationery about 40,000 feet as observed for several minutes. I observed one airliner jet manuveur in direct course with said object to a point that, from a point of my visibility, no more than 10 miles. The object disappeared before the airliner could get close enough. A second appearance occured after the airliner was out of my sight. It appeared to be in the same place. At this time, it was very odd that the airliner had altered it&#39;s course to intercept the object. On the second appearance, there where two Air Force Jets that were enroute( one from the east and one from the west).The object only remained stationary for about thirty seconds. The two jets came close to the object, but did not intercept it. Before the jets had reached the object, it(the light object)made a quick flash to the left and diappeared again. The two Air Force jets turned opposite of their own path. I remained outside for any other appearance for several minutes. After the jets were out of site, I returned inside my home.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It crossed the sky before my vehicle,while I was stopped at a red traffic light. It moved rapidly,but not as fast as say, a shooting star.  It made no changes in course, nor did it make any noise whatsoever. It was equal in brightness to a full moon.I also noted the object left a luminous trail,approx. four to five diameters of fireball while I watched it crossing the sky.<n>

When it moved, it was slow and steady, stopping on occasion. Almost as if it was scoping out an area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was about 2:15- 2:30  am on Wednesday morning I was driving west on Webster ave in the Bucktown area. While waiting at the stoplight at Damen ave, I was looking ahead and noticed something in the sky that was hovering and very brightly lit up. I thought that it seemed a little strange that it was not moving at all. When the light turned green I moved ahead crossing over Damen ave and all the time looking up and to the left to try to figure out what it was. When I got directly by it (and this thing was not that high up at all) I became so excited that I stopped in the middle of the street and got out of my car because I thought that if it were a helicopter there must be some noise happening. But when i got out of the car, I looked directly at it and there was absolutely no noise at all! I was so excited that I tried desperatly to get a good look at it but it was so dark that all I could see were at least three lights, two yellowish white and one bluish white. It started to move to the east and i followed it with my eyes until it started to slowly move to the north and then behind the church going nw. I jumped in the car determined to follow it but as it moved off I lost view of it. The thing that was weird was there was no noise, the way that it hovered and moved and the fact that it was pretty low in the sky totally freaked me out. I just know something was strange about this and i felt very much like this object was kind of scoping out the area. I called the hotline for the first time to report this because this is the only time I have ever seen anything like this and felt that it was important enough to report it.<n>

I was looking out the slidding glass doors from my bedroom balcony from my bed.  The door was ajar enough to hear ambient noise from outside. I was still in bed, but awoke and idly watching a star around 15 degrees above the horizen to the west.  Keep in mind that I am located on a hill adjacent to downtown LA and there is a lot of ambient lighting in the area including all of downtown LA with its major lit-up skyscrapers only a mile from the site towards the south. Visibility was good, but by no means crystal clear, hence the object I was looking at was either a major star or planet nearly directly west.  I notice a smaller but clearly distinguishable object slowly circling the brighter object.  At first I thought it was an airplane or a helocopter, however at this time of night, I discounted the possibility of an airplane as it was an unusual at this hour (I know LAX traffic patterns well and they don&#39;t fly over the city at this hour).  At any rate I couldn&#39;t take my eyes off of it and wandering what it could be.  Too high to be a helecopter; no sound.  Within a few seconds the smaller object simply turned, acerlerated and litteraly shot away like a meteor- across the northern sky from west to east. No big deal, I smiled and made a wish.  After a while, I began thinking that it could not be a meteor, meteors don&#39;t turn at right angles. There was no breaking apart or trail characteristic of meteors either. There was no sound.  It was quite amazing.  What was it? All of this activity would have to have been seen over the entire LA Basin as it took place at a great distance from me.  I am mostly curious if other may have seen it...surely they did, but did they see it slowly turn and then shoot like a bat out of hell?  If it was actually approaching earth during the slow turn, then it must have been a major asteroid.  If it was so easily visible during this period of time, it must have been huge to reflect that much light for so long.  And after that initial circ! ular app roach it was moving..really moving!<n>

The weather was nice approx. 68 degrees, slight wind, puffy clouds, no fog, best I could tell there were no airplanes in the area I was driving.<n>

We had finished a &#34;sweat&#34; and were sitting inside of the structure that contain the sweatlodge. There was no moon, no wind, and it was clear outside with all the stars shining bright. Loud noises could be heard as we were sitting inside. Going outside I looked around then up and 2 very large, circular were practically motionless in the air above us. Their dark round shapes were very clear against the stars above. There were many lights, not search lights, but more like windows all over the bottom of the 2 objects. I watched them and called the other person and he too came out and saw them. We went inside then came out later and they were still there and starting to move northeast. We are up on high ground and looking SW could see another coming very fast. It slowed to almost a stop immediately and made a formation of 3 like geese but only on one side. They started to move NE very low to the ground. You could walk faster than they moved. They took up much space in the sky. All 3 had many lights or maybe windows on the bottom. My Friend was in the Air Force and we talked about this time and again. He had no words to describe what we saw. They were not helicopters. They were not B-52&#39;s. Nothing could move this slow or appear to be motionless in the air. I in fact called the Minot AFB three times and was told that no aircraft of that nature was in the area. I was told that I probably seen a UFO. They were very low to the ground that you could almost throw a rock up and hit one. We finally got dressed in a hurry and started our vehicles up and drove up the short hill and they started to move in formation NE and were above the trees by the hill. There were no blinking red lights, green lights, no blinking lights at all on these objects to indicate port or starboard sides or the middle of the craft. This event occurred about 3 miles west of Mandaree where I have Sweat on top of the hills. The view is clear for miles around. I have the exact date in my book which I can s! end or g ive later.

It almost looked as if there were two of them but perhaps it was the same red streak from the fireball I witnessed. It was about the size of 1 1/2 full moons. It was very bright and caught my eye even though I was driving on mountainous roads from Blueridge, Ga. to Dahlonega and then home. I keep a cell phone in my van at all times and it was turned on lying on the passengers seat connected to the AC adapter which emits a light on the phone. At the same time I saw the fireball in the sky my cell phone cut off. I could tell this last fact easily because the light was off. I tried to turn the phone on but could not and it stayed off for about 30 seconds. Then I was able to turn it on. I could not tell if the fireball type object had fallen to earth because I was traveling on a narrow state highway with trees on either side. It was an exciting event to witness<n>

It disappeared behind a gathering of trees to my right.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had left the local library at 8:00 p.m. and was traveling home along a rural road. I was heading south when I saw a blu-green ball of light with a long yellow-orange tail come from the sky and fall behind some trees to my right. I am not a good judge of distance, but it was close enough for me to see that it was not a star. It did remind me of the light from a large roman candle, however, this light came from the sky, and not the ground When I returned home, I mentioned this incident to my husband who shrugged it off as a meteor, however, the fact that it was blue made no sense to me. That evening I got chills down my spine when I heard Peter Davenport come on the Art Bell show and share that this ball of light was seen from Florida to North Carolina. I am a 33 year old stay-at-home mom who has never seen any resemblance of a UFO ever! However, what I saw was certainly something I could not identify.<n>

It flew in a straight line, slowed a bit then speeded up again, it traveled a great distance in seconds,near the horizon it veered right and disappeared out of sight.  I could see many aircraft in the sky, because we were north of Sky Harbor airport. The speed of this light was amazingly fast in comparison to the aircraft in the area.  I&#39;ve seen hundreds of meteors in my life and am positive it was not a meteor, a plane, a bird, a bat, a reflection, a satelite, or a rocket.  I&#39;ve never seen anything like this before and am writing this because I have no idea on what other recourse to take.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I work an evening shift and at 7:30pm two co-workers and myself went outside because they smoke cigarettes. I don&#39;t smoke, but just went with them to talk.  We went up to the top floor of a four story parking lot for employees of the company.  The weather was great, were in Phoenix, there were plenty of stars, were near downtown, so the city lights drown the sky, yet it was easy to see the entire sky from this roof top.  Squaw peak mountain is several miles to the northeast of us and I could see a light mist near the peak.  Off on the east I could see some light clouds on the distant horizon.  Planes could easily be seen circling for a landing or take-off from Sky Harbor airport to the southeast. I saw a huge thick bright meteor to the east headed straight down, very bright with specks of bright green. It burned up and I was impressed with the thickness, brightness, and straight down direction that it had. It seemed very close, but I know these things can actually be very far away. All three of us saw the meteor.  We continued talking and about ten minutes later I commented again on how beautiful the meteor had been and the others were agreeing, just then, my friend said whats that, I turned around and saw the light zooming across the sky.  My first thought was a plane, it looked like it had a dim red speck on it. I&#39;ve also seen birds fly by a night at close distances that appear to fast high flying vehicles, but I quickly dismissed this being a plane or a bird.  Phoenix is full of helicopters, I see them alot. This was definitely not a helicopter. Way too fast, went very far, fast.  I thought it might be some type of reflection. No clouds, it varied it speed, slightly, then veered right.  It wasn&#39;t a reflection.  It happened very quickly and the third person in the group never caught eye of it.  I&#39;ve seen satelites before and I even saw the shuttle fly by one morning as it was about to land in California. This was faster than that. Did anyone else see anything? Just when you think you seen it all....I! was ama zed!<n>

The flash was diffuse but fairly bright in a cone shape -- lasted about a second or two -- the bottom covering about 50 feet or more. I quickly looked up directly above the flash and spotted a round light floating slowly toward the east at about 100-200 feet. I ran and got my binoculars and watched as it slowly continued moving to the east. This was a single steady white light with a greenish tinge which appeared to be somewhat dimmed by the thin clouds (created by multiple persistent contrails during the day). Within a few seconds it disappeared into heavy cloud bank. I have been watching aircraft in this area for over a year and am as sure as can be this was not an aircraft. On another night, I saw two flashes several seconds apart coming at an angle onto the nearby Lewisville Lake toward a yacht which was flashing its light also -- but did not see a source at that time. Are this surveillance spheres? -- Are these signals (short flashes)? -- Are they taking some kind of photos? What could be the purposes of brief pulses of light? Perhaps there is more than light involved?<n>

This thing was almost glowing, it could not have been a reflection because the jet was in the same spot at this point only higher, and there was not glow to the jet, then as I made a right turn, it put the two behind us, I was driving so I wasnt looking back, then my husband said oh my God it just vanished the jet was still heading the same way, but it was gone.<n>

It was not there the night before, and hasn&#39;t been there since. If I had to guess distance, I would say maybe 50 to 75 miles out.

I was going home from work after the a late-shift about 2:30 or so, heading North on GA-400. I just passed through the tollbooth about a mile back and everything lit-up with a wierd green light.  It was like a green flare had just lit up the road all around.  Maybe thats what it was?  If so it was a BIG flare! Anyway, I looked up and saw what looked like one of those little nyquil cold capsules magnified about a million times flying overhead.  It was glowing and radiating a lot of light but I didn&#39;t see a con-trail like the jets or a falling-star has. It didn&#39;t streak across the sky.  It appeared to be flying steady. I thought, &#34;well there&#39;s something you don&#39;t see everyday&#34;. I watched it travel from SE to NW and over the horizon for approximately 15-30 seconds. There weren&#39;t any other cars on that 2-4mi. stretch of road with me but I caught up to some traffic few miles up. Well, I just thought this was an interesting phenomena and wanted to see if anyone else had seen it too.

We headed out and started our soon to be odd journey to gleason.  we had just passed Irma hill, a BIG landmark in the area, when we heard a very strange sound. It sounded like our transmission fell out of our car and landed few cm from our current location.  A blinding flash filled our soon to be bewildered company and vehicle.  Our car stopped almost immediately. As soon as our car stopped, now illuminated, these beings emerged and appeared to surround our stationary vehicle.  The description of these beings is as follows: 6 feet tall, with a triangular shaped head, and  strange tenticles, not long, on their chin.  They spoke in a somewhat bubbly English voice.

They were exceptionally bright which attracted my attention initially, but too low on the horizon to be stars.They were a white light similar to an LED light. I could not detect any movement. After 10 or 12 seconds, it just faded away. Again I could not tell if it moved away, or just faded. The sky was hazy, but clear, and stars could be seen. I am a 50 year old truck driver and travel this road daily. I am familiar with the lights and terrain of this area.<n>

I was travelling on northbound Interstate 35, joining 35 from 183.  I was heading north towards the Braker Lane exit.  The time was approximately 8:45 p.m. on Monday, November 8th,  and I had just left my office to join some friends watching the Dallas game that had just started at 8:00.    As I was travelling north on I35,  I became aware of an extremely bright, pulsating object in the sky.   The object appeared to be descending rather slowly,  and was extremely bright - several times brighter than any visible stars in the sky.  As I exited on Braker Lane,  heading along the frontage road,  I still managed to track the object.  The object descended appromately 1000,  then changed direction,  heading almost due south.  By that time,  I was travelling east on Braker lane,  and became aware of more details about this peculiar object.  The object appeared to be accelerating - my estimate would be approx. 400-450 miles an hour at this point.  Something else caught my eye - 2 tiny lights that were trailing this object.  By this time,  Both objects had passed me,  and I was looking behind them as they continued south.  The original bright object that I first sighted now appeared to sport several red blinking lights on the anterior of the object - these lights blinked in sequence, similar to standard navigational lights (however,  there were at least 5-6 of these lights on the anterior of the craft).  In addition,  there appeared to be some kind of strobe or circular light on the belly of the craft - this appears to be what accounted for the extremely bright, pulsating light that I had witnessed earlier.  However,  as the object was starting to become perpindicular/head away from me at this point,  this characteristic had become less apparent.  The two white lights that were trailing the craft (from about a mile) appeared to be the exhaust of a seperate,  conventional jet aircraft.  As I arrived at my friends house I immediately stopped my engine and climbed out,  stil! l tracki ng the two objects.  The first thing I noticed was that the first craft was extremely silent - no audible propulsion sounds were discernable.  In addition,  dogs in yards directly under the craft&#39;s path were barking loudly,  and this could be heard distinctly as the craft passed over the subdivision.  What appeared to be a jet aircraft followed this path shortly after the unidentified craft,  and this audible noise did not disturb the animals.  I lost sight of both objects as they passed over the horizon,  but that is not the end of my sighting. At approximately 9:10 pm the same night,  I had stepped outside into the backyard of my friend&#39;s duplex to smoke a cigarette.  I must make the disclaimer at this point that I was in no way under the influence of any psychoactive/hallucinogenic substances,  or even alcohol. Stunned by the earlier sighting,  I watched the skies as I smoked the cigarette.  To my suprise,  looking east over the roof of the duplex,  I spotted a bright light of similar intensity slowly arcing up in a straight path.  Iridium satellite, or some other orbiting satellite,  is what I first thought.  The altitude/speed seemed consistent with an orbital satellite - however, as this object passed right over my head,  I was again able to glimpse the flashing red lights on the anterior,  and then knew it was the same object as I had seed earlier.  However,  this time the object&#39;s altitude was (estimated)  at least 50-60000 feet,  and it&#39;s speed had to be several times supersonic,  at least mach 8-9,  to account for the terrific speed in which it traversed the sky from horizon to horizon.  It&#39;s long,  arcing flight from horizon to horizon occured within about 4-5 seconds,  and that was a good indication of it&#39;s altitude and speed,  as I watched it ascend from the east, pass straight over me,  and continue to the west,  until it passed from my view.   I did not see any conventional aircraft in pursuit this time (no conventional aircraft to my knowledge could demonstrate  this type of acceleration/speed). My final thoughts:  The red blinking lights indicate possible navigation lights,  lending an earthly explanation to this - could this be an Aurora sighting?  One thing&#39;s for certain, though,  this is new and completely unconventional propulsion system.  I believe that the bright, pulsating glow of the circle? underneath the craft has something to do with the propulsion - just by shear virtue of its intense luminosity.<n>

This noise was heard for a period of approx 2 minutes, at two times, approx 15-20 minutes apart.  I expected this noise to proceed over my house as a plane would, or die down as the plane left the area, however the noise droned on at the same level for 2+ minutes then abruptly ended.  This noise vibrated my house, upset the dog, and there were dogs\coyotes howling in the woods during this incident.  My daugher claimed to see a flash of light accross the western sky after the first incident.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I heard an engine sound, that sounded like an aircraft engine.  WE frequently have the Air National Guard flying over our house so I didn&#39;t take much notice.  Our house began to vibrate slightly and the dog began to bark and I noticed that the sound was not proceeding over the house as a plane would.  I went outside and listened to the engine sound and waited for the &#34;plane&#34; to pass over the house, or for the sound to die down as they flew away.  The sound continued to drone on for approx 2 minutes, there were coyotes howling in the woods behind my house in the direction of the sound. Due North. The sound abuptly stopped.  I went inside and my daughter came down stairs.  She to had heard the sound and after it stopped she claims to have seen a flash of light accross the Western Sky. I questioned her about the flash, thinking it could be the flash of the sunset.  She said it was very sharp and bright.  Approx 15-20 minutes later we again heard the same engine noise in the wood North of my house.  Again it lasted for approx 2 minutes and then abruptly stopped.  Due North of my home is approx 4 acres of woods and then a seclued farm field.  We did not see any craft or ship of any kind.  The only sighting was the flash. It was after dark at the time, and I can&#39;t think of what could have been in the woods at that time of night making that kind of sound.  It was louder then a chain saw, or tractor.  It made my house vibrate. The best decription of the sound would be that of a aircraft engine.<n>

I watch it closely while driving but could not get my binoculars on it fast enough.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was driving north across Iowa City at 10:30 AM. The sky was clear. I saw a round white object in the north. It seemed small at first but then hovered and seemed larger and a bit like a giant inflated beer can seen in beach commercials, like a cylinder standing up. I headed north on a One Way street trying to keep it in view and it was moving slowly North or a few degrees east of North as it moved away across the Interstate 80 out into the country. About this time I noticed contrails moving to the west from two jets but they seemed different form the hundreds of commercial jets seen daily. They were close together and were very clear for the distance away. I was trying to get home to get my 10 power binoculars. By the time I got to my back yard the object was to far north to be seen even low on the horizen and I chose not to chase it out into the country. It could have been drifting slowly with prevailing winds but I judge its size to be at least 20 feet high from how big it still appeared after almost 10 minutes of viewing as my car moved north. Also the two planes appeared at about the same heading as the location of the white egg shaped object and I even thought for a while they were two UFOs but then I could make out that they were a sort of jet plane, but perhaps they were UFOs, they seemed different than most jets I see and were moving close to each other although they seemed to be of different size and shape.<n>

I proceeded to get binoculars. And when i returned the object was perhaps 4 or 5 miles away and south of my position. And i continued to watch the object through the binoculars. Was difficult to keep the binoculars steady. Bu i saw the same thing through them. One blinking white light, and two to three gold lights! Estimated speed was maybe 50 to 70 mph. Didnt hear any noise from the craft. Will try to keep an eye out for the object again in the future. The gold colored lights were the most unusual part of the sighting! I have never seen lights like this on any flying object before!!!<n>

It had a rotating light which seemed to be mostly white and only a flash of red and it seemed to have a hazie appearance about it.   But mostly it was white and just sat in the sky in the north/east sky just rotating and hovering.    Then it was as if someone just turned off the lights and it wasn&#39;t there any longer. There was no sound that seemed to generate from the object just silence and stillness.   I couldn&#39;t even hear any crickets,   that&#39;s how quiet it was.<n>

Their flight pattern was different than a normal flying object (plane,helicopter) which was what raised a flag in my mind.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What made me look closer at these objects originally was that I first saw two objects that seemed to be &#34;too close&#34; to each other flying at roughly the same altitude.I continued to watch and the object on my right seemed to &#34;catch up&#34; to the one on the left. At this time I noticed two more sets of lights that looked just like the first two sets I witnessed. The second set seemed to follow the first set off to the North past my house. Lastly, after I saw the second set one last set of lights similar to the first two sets appeared and moved to the north. I remember thinking how many of these things were there? And why don&#39;t I hear anything? Surely if they were helicopters, and five of them at that, it would stand to reason that I would hear something no matter how far away. I say helicopters only because the way the objects were moving, planes could&#39;nt. Nothing super speed or anything like that, but erratic enough to know that it was&#39;nt a plane. When I say erratic I don&#39;t mean to imply that they were flying in any aggresive or dangerous way, just simply not something you are used to seeing in the sky. They all appeared to know were the others  were. As far as what they looked like I do not know. All that I saw were white lights, one on top and two on either side slightly lower like a little pyramid. They seemed to blink but not on purpose. It looked more like just that they were in motion that was causing the lights to fluctuate. Thats it.<n>

Jupiter is due East in the sky and at about 35 degrees above the horizon.  The object was traveling due North at a constant elevation.  I watched the object for 10 minutes until it _faded_ out.  The object faded at a position of North-North-East.  It took about 10 seconds to fade out.  There were no perceived lights on the object.  There were at that time 5 aircraft in the sky traveling from East to West all with their running lights blinking.  Atmospheric conditions: Clear, moonless, wind less than 5mph, temp 40degF.<n>

It was sunset but the was not in the sky and there was a sunset at the time the object was so strange that I pulled off the road at a gas station (at the SW corner of Skokie Blvd. and Dundee Rd.). Since I was on my way to shoot video I had 2 Digital Video cameras with me 1 (a Canon GL-1), which already had a fresh battery in it and some tape also. I parked my car and got about 34 seconds on tape. Today (Nov.8) I contacted the Palwaukee airport control tower and spoke with a man who said to send him some stills from the video which I did and e-mailed them to him. I also called the FAA and was given a few numbers to contact. Upon reching someone, who thought it to be very interesting gave me the number for the UFO Center. I am a 31 yr old digital video editor producer, I mostly work with music videos, when I looked at the tape on my computer it looked like a big black snowflake (diamond shaped), it had structures sticking up and down on it but from a distance it looked almost like a big black kite, there were no lights at all and was just sort of floating moving NW from my position. I have a Video Broadcast Processor whic I was able to lighten up the picture and it is like nothing I have ever seen. When I first saw it I had to pull over it looked like nothing I have ever seen before!<n>

The crafts were long thin enlongated rectangles, appearing as flying  florescent light tubes in this rectangle shape, entire perimeter outlined in contingal light.  approx distance 1/8 mile from us.  A single craft first appeared flying at high speed, from NE to SW.  Within 1 minute, three additional craft appeared, flying at low speed, then the craft individually accelerated, much like a airport lineup.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The observers are both male, ages 58, and 54.  1st time sighting for one male, second time sighting (prev was Oklahoma City cir: 1964 of 3 hovering saucer shaped) other male. Neither male drink, both professional business men. The 4 craft sightings were in Chaco Canyon Area, N.W. New Mexico. appox 9:30PM, Sat, Nov 6,99.   The flight direction was S.W., assumed craft came from Dulce NM, a N.E. Direction.  Duration of the sightings was approx 60 seconds for the first singular craft, and 120 seconds for the following three craft, which appeared 1 minute after the first craft. The sky was clear, star filled night, with blinking commercial airplane lights flying in a S.S.W. Direction immediately preceeding the sighting period. All four craft had same lighted features - resembling enlongated rectangular florescent (orange/red) outlined (appeared like flying florescent tubes)(bright,like those used in store windows).  We were close enough, the light blocked actually seeing the craft itself.  Estimate distance to be less than 1/4 to 1/8 mile. The first single craft, came in at relative slow speed (but much faster than a helocopter, then shot off at very high speed.  The following three craft also accelerated at approximately the same place, but each took their turn, with a few seconds inbetween these individual accelerations.  The craft were silent. The three craft flew in a line formation, but at different intervals of space inbetween when they arrived. Our visual position was below the horizon, as we were in a shallow canyon approx 3/4 mile wide, 100/200 ft deep.  I would estimate the distance from the craft at approx 1/2 mile (based on USAF flight line military experience). Because of the brightness of these long lights, I could not estimate the length of the craft, nor see anything behind the lighted area. I am interested if there are other reports of these wierd shaped craft, resembling flying neon tubes.<n>

Object appeared to be a ball of light that divided with a dark line (like a hamburger) and at one point appeared to turn on edgewhere three white lights in a triangle pattern were visible.  After observing for several minutes, a digital camcorder was employed to capture the phenomena.  At about the time the camera was set up three more objects joined the first.  The newcomers were slightly smaller appearing and at times faded to deep red or blinked out completely.  At one point, the objects appeared to &#34;shoot&#34; white lights between each other that traveled at high speed from one to another.  The light show went on for at least 45 minutes and 22 minutes of it are on tape.  It is noteworthy that the camera turned off several times when pointed in the direction of the lights (CCD overload shutdown??) even though the lights did not appear to be of extreme intensity.<n>

No noise was heard and no evidence of any kind was left in the sky. It seemed when it first appeared to be a streak of very fast moving light then it was a large circular shape when it flashed,then their was nothing.It happend within a matter of seconds. Their was not even enough time to get the others attention right in front of us. It was my husbands friend that witnessed it with myself and he doesnt want to talk about it because he does not know what to say..<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had invited many friends over for a partylite candel party and it was the end of the evening and two friends remained to chat for a while longer. It was about 1:30 or so and we were on the back porch while the guys chatted about sports and we were discussing the other couple&#39;s new relationship. My husband and my friend stood facing myself and his bestfriend. We were outside because I do not allow smoking in the house and it was rather cold so I was standing part way in the door way to keep warm. As we were talking it appeared something was flying over the small wooded area behind our townhome. Thinking it was just a small aircraft because we are so close to the airforce base I payed no mind until it was right in between the trees in the back yard it flashed a huge round bright light and then appeared to be gone. I yelled what the hell was that and the person beside me had seen it to and we were in amazement and didint know what to make of it. The two that had not seen it passed it off as a meteor or a large fire display of some kind. But seeing the pattern it flew in, It was coming over the woods to the north of us and seemed to speed up Flash and then disapear. Im not saying it was a ufo but it was something I can not explain and I would love for someone to ease my mind that it was a meteor or something . I cant help but to believe that people do really see unexplained things..Please respond if anyone saw this and has a reasonable explanation. No one will take me seriously. I am not a drinker I am a very sane person whom works hard for a living my husband is an enlisted person in the usaf. This is merely a coincidence. But please respond!!!<n>

No military around here.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((Follow up report.))<n> <n><n> <n><n> I sent a report in last night. I did not tell I got this on VHS. The tape shows the light.

As I watched it longer it began to look like the little dipper,BUT the figugures are to high and to faint and the pattern changed. I went in and called your hot line and after I talked to PETER I went back outside and looked for them agian. They are still there! Ther pattern has changed to more of a arrow with fainter &#34;stars&#34; Twinkling next to the point of the arrow. And the whole configuration has drifted further west. I went and got my sister and she saw them to. It is 2323hrs now and I went outside and look for them with binoculars ,8 by21,and THEY ARE STILL THERE! and have changed their pattern yet AGIAN.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I first saw them it was 10:30pm and they were in a &#34;little dipper shape. I thought they were stars but when I compared the other stars to them I relized it wasn&#39;t the little dipper becuase they are ALOT HIGHER THEN THE OTHER STARS and they are closer togather and as I kept watching them their we&#39;re other fainter,smaller lights around the &#34;dipper&#34; part.  After I got off the Phone with Peter I went back outside and looked for them agian and they were still thier but further west in the sky and had changed their pattern agian! This time the pattern was more of an arrow shape and around the &#34;tip&#34; Or &#34;point&#34; of the shape the faint smaller lights were still there too. I remembered I had some binoculars and I got them and went back and looked at them agian! They are still there and in a different pattern. With the binoculars I could see the shapes better but not well enough to describe in detail. But, They are white lights, round white lights. And the fainter lights stay next to the tip of the shape ( which is toward the west). That all I can take for this experience!<n>
11/5/99 21:35|Springfield (14 mi.

I saw two blinking white strobe like objects in the south sky, extremely close together. ASNd they appeared stationary. It startled me because I did not think aircraft could get that close and also there were no blinking colored lights. Four minutes later, an extremely bright red fireball, descended at a very low altitude of 5000 feet or less, at a 20 degree angle in the vicinity of the blimnking strobes. The fireball went from west to east and disappeared behind some trees. Then the two strobe like objects departed each other, one going to the east and one to the west.Then at 21:55, three aircraft with blinking green lights started circling the area where I lost sight of the fireball. They circled around about 12 minutes and then departed the area, going north toward Springfield. After the fire ball incident, I also emailed the meteorologist of a local TV station to see if there were any reports of any fireballs.<n>

Had red and clear lights on it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We live about 20 miles south of Topeka, KS on a farm. Last Friday night my wife came into my office and asked if there are Choppers that do not make any noise? I asked why and she said &#34;there was something hovering in our field and it was flying silently in a jagged fashion&#34;. Seems our hunting dog was whimpering loudly and my wife went out on our porch to investigate. By the time I got there it had left the area. She described it to me as a silver disk with red and clear lights and no strobes. After the event I observed an abnormal amount of aircraft in my area. I am close to Forbes Field but not in a pathway and normally never see any aircraft near my place. It was quite clear the something was stirring up the hornets. The next day we let Murphy, or dog, out to run and he went right to the site of the hover and began to dig a hole and then laid in it. He would not move, we had to go physically pick him up and bring him back to our house. I checked the hole he had dug and did not find anything unusual.<n>

It moved very graceful, yet crossed the sky at such a fast pace.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I just finished working out at the running track at the intermediate school. It was 7:30 pm and I was laying on the bleachers looking up at Jupiter. I was laying with my head pointing NW, suddenly a object shaped like a Chevron caught my attention. The object was over on my right side moving SE at a slow speed. It was completely dark out and there where no lights on the craft, it looked dull and light in color, almost transparent.The funny thing was it made no noise, I live under the route that most planes take heading east out of LAX and John Wayne Airport. So we can always faintly hear the sound of the jets when they pass over head, but not this one. I watched it for about 20 seconds until it disappeared. I continued to lay there and wonder about what I just saw, then at 7:40 pm the same shape crossed the entire sky from right to left. What was so different was the rate of speed, it took about 5 or 6 seconds to crossover my line of sight. I was still laying on my back, so I could see the whole sky. The shape was traveling so fast, yet it looked to move so graceful. What a sight! Then at 7:57pm, I seen the same thing again, only this time it was on my left side, traveling much like the the first sighting, slow and graceful. Well thats it, I&#39;m a believer now, it was such a sight. Its now 9:15pm and I&#39;m going back out to see if its still hangin around.<n>

11/5/99 18:15|Santa Clara|CA|Rectangle|5-10 minutes|On Friday Nov. 5, 1999 just before sunset, a gigantic metalic colored dominoe shaped object flew over the San Francisco Bay Area.|5/24/05|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/042/S42485.html|418|ndxe199911| On Friday Nov. 5, 1999 just before sunset, a gigantic metalic colored dominoe shaped object flew over the San Francisco Bay Area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On Friday afternoon (~6:15 P.M.) Nov. 05, 1999 I was playing with my dog in the backyard of my home in Santa Clara, CA. which is directly behind Paramounts Great America Theme Park.  There were light partial clouds that day and no fog, so any aircraft was clearly visible.  Seeing aircraft on a continuous basis to and from San Jose International Airport and Moffett Field was common at that locale.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This evening I noticed the incoming flight patterns of the P3 Orion naval aircraft from Moffett Field.  The planes appeared to approach from the north, then turned west toward the air field (from my perspective).  They would first appear to be small twinkling lights, then as they got closer, of course, they would finally take the shape of an airplane.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then, suddenly, I noticed one of them appeared to be tumbling from the sky?!   I ran to the fence and thought to myself, Jesus that plane is going to crash!  I&#39;m actually going to witness a plane crash!  But as it got closer it looked like it was diamond shaped?<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then it shape shifted into what appeared to be a slow moving metalic colored dominoe moving southbound in the north sky!  What...in...the...hell...?!  I lost sight of it as it passed behind my neighbors roof.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I rubbed my eyes in disbelief and shook my head violently!  I thought to myself, okay I am not crazy, when this thing reappears from the other side of the roof it&#39;s going to be a Boing passenger liner on it&#39;s way to San Jose Airport.  Much to my surprise, when it reappeared it was, in fact, a gigantic wingless craft cruising as slow as you please right over the Bay Area!!  AAAAAh, it&#39;s happening, we&#39;re being invaded by aliens!!!!!<n> <n><n> <n><n> I ran frantically screaming into my front yard trying to direct anyone&#39;s attention to this craft.  My mother, niece, grand-nephew, friend (a former nuclear powered submarine pilot), and four of my neighbor&#39;s (one of which was a retired senior engineer from Lockeed Martin) came outside to see what I was yelling about.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then, in disbelief, we all watched this UFO perform some of the most amazing arial maneuvers I&#39;ve ever seen with my own eyes!  First, as it was moving in a southernly direction, it made an immediate 90 degree turn west.  No banking, no arch, I mean on a dime!  Then, it suddenly ascended, glowing orange as it rose!  I thought aloud, &#34;look a plasma, it&#39;s striking a plasma!&#34;  My neighbor, Mr. C replied, &#34;no, it&#39;s catching the tangent rays of the sun.&#34;  I asked, &#34;How big is this thing, a couple, or a few football stadiums maybe?&#34;  Wild eyed, Mr. C replied, &#34;No, much much bigger...like maybe half the size of the Bay Area?!...I don&#39;t know?!&#34;<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then it made a series of zig-zag and square moves which took our breath away, but the most spectacular move was it&#39;s northernly directional shot accross the sky!  It flew so fast that visually it seemed to elongate, or stretch like a rubber band accross the sky to an abrupt stop!<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then, from it&#39;s north easternly point in the sky it ascended at a very fast rate until it appeared to be a star in the early evening sky.  It stayed at that point in the heavens for several hours until it just disappeared (~03:00 a.m.).<n> <n><n> <n><n> Unfortunately, we were all so shocked we didn&#39;t have the presence of mind to get a camera or camcorder.  No calls to the authorities were made either.<n> <n><n> <n><n> For weeks I looked through the San Jose Mecury News paper and watched the televised news reports for anything related to the event that I and my family members and neighbors witnessed.  Nothing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;ve watched programs on UFO&#39;s and read countless testamonial from eye witness accounts of similar such events, but nothing related to that particular event on that particular day.  It amazes me that something like that over such a heavily concentrated population center never made it to the media.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I still don&#39;t know what we saw on that day, but I couldn&#39;t keep this to myself any longer.<n> <n><n> <n><n> That is why I purposely looked for this web-site to report this event.  I&#39;m sorry it took me so long.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of sighting is approximate.  PD))<n>

In a few minutes it changed to a bright glowing oval shape with a slight dome and blinking lights at the top and bottom. At first I thought it was a blimp but it was so brightly glowing. I thought how could it be it was night and dark outside. Did I see a blimp or what. After it hovered over the freeway it tipped to the east. I left the freeway and spotted it over the bay as a fuzzy almost round shape.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I would like to know what I saw.  An easy explanation would be a blimp that was lighted in some way.  We do have blimps up at times but that have bold lettering easily seen but this was not evident.  I didn&#39;t know who the ask maybe you can supply information.<n>

This did not appear to be a plane or helicopter due to the erratics manuvuers it was making. It stayed in the same area, approximately 10,000 feet high over the south shore of Long Island. It had an up and down, side to side and even a diagonal motion to it. Periodically there were faint blue flashes emitting around it. It was a diamond to saucer type shape. I tried to look at it through binoculars but could not focus. After about 15 minutes, it slowly moved southwest unitl it disappeared from my view over the tree line.<n>

My wife and I were in bed just falling a sleep to Art Bell&#39;s radio show.  Both of our eyes were closed.  When the light happened, it was like me looking up at the sun in broad day light.  She experienced that same thing.  Neither of us registered that it had even happened for a minute or two till she asked me if I had seen it. I said I had and that disturbed both of us.  We discussed if it could have been head lights passing over our apartment window, as we are on the second story, but both came to the conclusion that it could not have been so as it was just to bright.  We didn&#39;t see any craft or anything, but it was not a normal occurance.<n>

It was 10:50 PM last night, cold and very clear night when I was about a mile from my exit Kent Des Moines Rd off I-5(not far from SeaTac airport), I noticed three sets of lights - two of them together and one a little further away - which were stationary and looked like street lights. I discarded the possibility that they were plane lights because the lights were stationary.I pointed it out to my wife, and as we got closer we realized they were neither street lights nor plane lights, well at least not man made. When I took the exit and was waiting at the signal light, I could clearly see one of the two objects that were together right above me. The object was moving very slowly ESE to WNW almost stationary above me and was not making any noise. It was like a disc, and I could see different colors - white, yellow, green/blue, same goes with my wife she had  a better look than me because my eyes were on the road. She was kinda worried at the signal light and wanted me to drive away quickly, I guess she didn&#39;t want to be kidnapped by them. So I didn&#39;t go back to get another look and we couldn&#39;t notice the objects as I headed east after taking the exit and descended down Kent west hill on Kent Des Moines Rd. But we both were pretty sure it was nothing man made, because those objects were pretty stationary and were floating in the sky like a leaf.<n>

I always look up because jets fly out of Seattle-Tacoma Intntl Airport right over the farm. This jet was making the typical 747 rumble in the sky so I looked up. It was heading SE. suddenly I noticed the a bright object was flying high in the sky to the left of the 747. The object flew over the top of the 747. The object was much higher then the 747 which I figure at 4-5 thousand feet. This object was at least 20 thousand feet or higher. The object left on contrail but other jets in the sky at high altitude were. The object was heading toward the sun so I soon lost sight of it. One other thing, as it flew forward it looked like the object &#34;skipping&#34; left and right of a straight line. The shape of the object was elongated arrow shaped. Color- It was reflecting the sun light. I couldn&#39;t hear any noise because of the jet. This sighting lasted less then 2 minutes.

I could see no color but it had a very strong glow in the sunny daylight noon hour.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Time was 12:05 MST Thursday Nov4 1999 I was travelling west on Highway 16 just North of a small town called Spruce Grove.  I notice this particular bright cloud out my drivers side window looking south.  I looked at it and it had sort of a comet looking appearance about it --mainly this cloud seemed to have a tail and then I noticed it was moving.   I looked to the side several times and it seemed to be moving a pace similar to an aircraft.  I had to drive about a mile in order to find a place to pull over and observe the object safely.  When I picked up the object again in the sky it had move further south and was still quite visible due to its brightness. I measured the size of the object in the air with my arms extended and it measured to be about 1/2 centimetre.  It moved behind a cloud and then reappeared and move steadily off to the distance.  The pace was consist while viewing this object.<n>

It moved very slowly across the sky, making a quiet puffing noise. This is the description of what thousands of people on the Gazelle Peninsula of East New Britain saw in the sky over the weekend. The people of the remote Bainingo ranges, cut off from television and anything else that is modern, possibly had the best description. They say a craft, which had huge lumps on the sides with light flickering around it. Some Bainingos said the object was lit up all around like a red-hot stone in an oven pit. But what they saw was exactly what others on the Gazelle Peninsula witnessed on the same night, Thursday, November 4. The people who saw the flying craft concluded that they were witnessing a spacecraft from another planet. On other parts of the province, similar sightings were made, although their descriptions were slightly different. Over on Duke of York Islands those living on the island closest to New Ireland Province reported seeing a huge craft hovering just meters above the seas off St George Channel, and traveling at a very slow speed. They claimed they saw other smaller crafts with bright lights circulating the bigger craft in a playful manner. They claimed they watched the craft until it disappeared over the high mountains in New Ireland. At Rangulit village, in the Baining area, on the same night, naturalized citizen John Berenti of Namatanai in New Ireland, and his family were sitting on the verandahs of their home when, all of a sudden, a huge craft appeared just above the top of the mango trees. &#34;It was so big, about 200 meters (660 feet) to 300 meters (990 feet) long, and 50 meters (165 feet) wide. &#34;It was moving very, very slowly across the sky and was lit up like a shooting star and it had two very bright lights at the tail. &#34;We honestly did not know what it was, but it certainly wasn’t an aircraft,&#34; Mr. Berenti said. &#34;It was traveling too slow, far too slow. &#34;It did not make any loud sound, just a quite puffing sound as it glided gracefully over the tree tops,&#34; he said. Mr. Berenti said his entire family saw the craft. He said the people who lived there, who saw the craft, lit handheld fires and chased after the craft, wanting to see where it would go. Mr. Berenti said he had never seen anything like it and he was troubled by it. &#34;It cannot be associated with anything on this planet.&#34; He considered that the bright glow around the craft was its magnetic field, keeping the force of gravity away.&#34; About 50 kilometers (30 miles) across the sea from Lassul Baining, Police Officer Raymond Theodore was sitting under his house along Vuvu Beach, North Coast of Rabaul, around 8:30 p.m. when he noticed what looked to be a huge craft traveling just meters above the seas. &#34;First I thought it was a ship but then we saw it travel over Waton Island.&#34; &#34;It had very bright lights at the back as it moved along, but it made no sound,&#34; he said. Others who saw the craft gave similar accounts.

In other parts of the province, similar sightings were made, the Post-Courier reported. &#34;We honestly did not know what t was, but it certainly wasn&#39;t an aircraft,&#34; one resident said.

At first I thought I was looking at three very brightly shining stars widely spaced apart in a north westerly direction but pulsating strongly. Then it occured to me that stars are not reddish-orange usually but these lights were as high up as the stars.They did not move,made no sound nor did I see any outline other than the lights would be at each corner of a huge triangle. I watched for about five minutes,went inside,came back out and they had gone.<n>

When I looked closer it was moving slowly up, then it shot up into the air.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was looking out of my bedroom window, I noticed an unusually bright star in the sky. Looking closer I noticed that it was slowly moving up. I thought that it was my imagination or a trick with my eyes so I went to my window to look properly. To my astonishment it was moving up, very slowly however, after about 1 or 2 minutes it shot up into the air, probably taking no longer than a second to be totaly out of sight. The object was about 30 degrees above the horizon and was in the North-East. I couldnt predict distance at all due to the object having no particular shape or features. If it wasnt moving I would have thought it as being a bright star. Since it was I automatically thought either sattalite or aircraft, but no sattalite or aircraft or anyother craft that I know of has that accelerarion and moving ability.<n>

We were very close to Area 51 at the time of the sighting.  I was able to capture approximately 10 minutes of what I believe is very striking video.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Early November 3, 1999 my brother and I were searching for Area 51.  After a long tiring drive down the roughest dirt road I&#39;ve ever seen we tired and gave up.  Then as we drove down Extraterrestrial Hwy.  I noticed a light in the sky.  It appeared to be below the moon, but was brighter and larger than any star in the sky.  I video taped the object for several minutes we then stopped the car to get a better video.  I was able to capture about 10 minutes of video before my battery died.  We thought the object was amazing, but figured once we were able to view the video we would realize it was just a star.  However, I don&#39;t believe what we saw was a star.  We did witness an airplane fly through the general area (I&#39;m not sure if that is on the tape, however), but it was hard to tell where the plane was in relation to the light.  To the naked eye it appeared to be a bright light, but when I was able to zoom in on the light it appeared to pulsate.  At one point I was completely zoomed in at holding completely still and the object moved about. Recently I watched a show about sightings over Phoenix in 1997.  One man&#39;s video taken a few days before all of the other sightings was an exact match to the sighting my brother and I had.  The light was still in the sky an hour later when we reached our hotel.  I have made a copy of my tape and would very much like to have someone with some expertise in the field view it.<n>
11/2/99 20:25|South Pasadena|CA|Circle|3 minutes|While sitting in my patio, I glanced up and was amazed at an array of glowing orange spheres moving across the sky.|11/9/99|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/010/S10412.html|433|ndxe199911| While sitting in my patio, I glanced up and was amazed at an array of glowing orange spheres moving across the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was sitting in my patio listening to music, and I glanced up and saw a W-shaped array of large, bright, glowing, orange lights in the sky. My first thought was that it looked like the constellation Cassiopia because of its shape. But it only took about 5 seconds after my initial shock to realize I was seeing something extrordinary. As they drifted westward, they moved in a random, criss-cross manner, very unlike balloons. As two would maneuver across each other, they would brighten. The thing that struck me was that they couldn&#39;t be balloons if they were moving that quickly back and forth, and also they were staying grouped together tightly as they moved across the sky instead of drifting apart as balloons would. Their movements looked very unnatural. One by one I lost view of them as they crossed the constellation Aquila. If anyone else in the L.A. area saw this, please contact me. I would very much like to hear a description of what someone else saw.<n>
11/2/99 20:25|Duncan|OK|Other|4 seconds|Looking high into the eastern sky, I saw an "arc" of dim orange lights gliding silently from the north, and curve towards the southeast|11/9/99|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/010/S10414.html|434|ndxe199911| Looking high into the eastern sky, I saw an &#34;arc&#34; of dim orange lights gliding silently from the north, and curve towards the southeast.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I work nights, and had just come out of my house to get in my car around 8:25 pm.  As I usually tend to do, I looked up toward the east to see how clear the sky was, and my attention was immediately drawn to an arc of 12-14 extremely dim orange lights coming from the north, almost directly over my head.  They glided silently toward the south, making a slight turn toward the southeast and then faded and vanished as they turned.  The whole thing lasted about 4 seconds.  I can&#39;t make an estimate of the altitude, but from one end to the other, the arc was about the width of my fist at arm&#39;s length.  It appeared to be fairly low in the sky.  It was the smoothest motion that I&#39;ve ever seen anything move with, and seemed very surreal.  What struck me as odd was that the lights were so dim that they were barely visible in the dark sky.  I tried to discern whether they were individual lights flying in a formation, or if they were all on one object, but it swept by so quickly, I couldn&#39;t tell if the stars were blocked from view as it passed over.  There was positively no sound.  I kept watching and listening for a few minutes but nothing else occurred.<n>

Two were smaller with 3 lights each,1 larger craft with a circle of lights in the center. The two smaller crafts were to the westside,one ahead and one behind, the larger craft. They were moving very fast,with no sound, and no flashing lights. All the lights were dim and white. The lights that made-up the circle on the larger craft had a little blue tint to them,there were about 5 lights to the circle.<n>

I THOUGHT AT FIRST IT WAS 2 AIRPLANES BUT AT 1:00 IN THE MORNING WHY WOULD THEY BE THAT CLOSE? THE FIRST WAS TRAVELING NORTH,THE SECOND WAS HEADING EAST. THE THIRD CAME FROM THE WEST HEADING TO THE EAST. THEY WERE TRAVELING ERRACTICALLY, UP AND DOWN MOVEMENTS. EACH WAS EXACTLY THE SAME IN SIZE,EACH HAD TWINKLING RED AND WHITE LIGHTS. AS I WATCHED,THE ONE TRAVELING NORTH HEADED OFF TO THE WEST. THE TWO HEADING EAST CONTINUED. THE NIGHT WAS CLEAR AND HAD NO WIND. THERE WAS NO SOUND COMING FROM ANY OF THEM. THE SAHPE OF THEM APPEARED TO BE DISK ALTOUGH I DIDN&#39;T SEE ANY OUTLINE,THE LIGHTS WERE BANDED TOGETHER IN A ALMOST RECTANGULAR SHAPE. THE FIRST OBJECT TURNED AND HEADED NORTH,TOWARD MY HOUSE.THE TWINKLING RED AND WHITE LIGHTS TURNED TO THREE VERY BRIGHT WHITE LIGHTS IN A TRIANGULAR SHAPE. I STILL SEE NO DEFINED SHAPE. I GO INSIDE AND LOOK OUT MY FRONT WINDOW AND SEE THE OBJECT GO OVER,CHANGING BACK TO THE RED AND WHITE LIGHTS. FEELING RATHER SHAKEN, I GO TO BED.<n>

WHEN IGLANCED UP MINUTES LATER I REALIZED THE LIGHT WAS NOT TURNED ON. I LOOKED OUT THE WINDOW AND REALIZED THERE WAS SOME SORT OF CRAFT HOVERING ABOVE THE TREES JUST PAST THE FENCED IN AREA OF MY YARD. WE LIVED JUST 1 MILE SOUTH OF THE CITY AND THE SKY LINE WAS LIT FROM THE CITY LIGHTS SO I COULD MAKE OUT HTE SHAPE OF THE CRAFT. IT WAS A VERY SLEEK SAUCER SHAPE SEEMINGLY EVEN TOP AND BOTTOM. THERE WERE LARGE WINDOWS SEPARATED EVERY EIGHT TO TEN FEET BY POSTS. THE INTERIOR WAS LIT BY A VERY BRILLIANT LIGHT THAT DID NOT SHINE OUT OF THE VEHICAL ONTO SURROUNDING TREES WICH WAS ODD. STANDING IN THE VEHICAL WAS WHAT SEEMED TO BE A MALE FIGURE , HUMAN IN SHAPE, LEANING ON A LEDGE WITH HIS HANDS ON IT, LOOKING AT OUR HOUSE. WHEN I CAME TO THE WINDOW AND HE SAW ME LOOKING AT HIM HE DID NOT MOVE AND JUST CONTINUED LOOKING AT ME. I WAS FACINATED. BECAUSE OF THE LIGHT FROM THE CITY BEHIND IT I COULD SEE THE CRAFT JUST FLOATING AND GENTLY ROCKING AS IF A BOAT ON WATER. I STARTED SCREAMING TO MY HUSBAND, WHO WAS ON 2THE OTHER SIDE OF THE HOUSE IN OUR BEDROOM, TI HURRY AND COME SEE THIS. JUST THEN THE CRAFT GENTLY TILTED SO THAT I COULD SEETHE BOTTOM AND STARTED TO MOVE SLOWLY TO THE EAST. BY THE TIME MY HUSBAND GOT TO THE WINDOW IT WAS ABOUT 50 FEET OFF THE GROUND AND 50 FEET AWAY AND ALL YOU COULD SEE WERE THE RED AND WHITE BLINKING LIGHTS ON THE BOTTOM. HE TRIED TO TELL ME IT WAS PROBABLY A HELICOPTER BUT I EXPLAINED TO HIM THERE WAS NO SOUND SO IT COULD NOT BEEN A HELICOPTER BECAUSE THE NOISE WOULD HAVE BEEN VERY LOUD THAT CLOSE TO THE HOUSE. A FEW MONTHS BEFORE THIS THE CITY HAD TO REPLACE A LARGE TRANSFORMER THAT WAS IN THE AREA THE CRAFT WAS IN . A FEW DAYS AFTER THIS INCIDENT I NOTICED CITY TRUCKS IN MY PROPERTY CHANGING TH! E TRANSFORMER AGAIN. I HAD NOT CALLED THEM THIS TIME. THE FIRST TIME IT WAS CHANGED I HAD NOTICED THE TRANSFORMER HUMMING AND CALLED THE CITY AND THEY CAME OUT NAD REPLACED IT. THE CRAFT HAD BEEN OUTSIDE MY HOUSE FAR SOMEWHERE BETWEEN 10 AND 20 MINUTES. 1 OR TWO DAYS LATER WAS A MAJOR METEOR SHOWER AND I WAS OUTSIDE WATCHING IT WHEN A LOW FLYING GREEN BALL OF LIGHT PASSED OVER THE TOP OF MY HOUSE GOING THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION OF THE METEOR SHOWER.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date in October is approximate.

IT WAS HEADING S-SW, AT A VERY HIGH RATE OF SPEED. THERE WAS NO SOUND AT ALL. AT FIRST IT APPEARED TO BE A FLOCK OF BIRDS, BUT THE FORMATION WAS ENTIRELY TO BIG AND MOVING TOO FAST. IT WAS ONLY VISIBLE FOR A FEW SECONDS. AS IT FLEW OVER IT SEEMED TO CHANGE SHAPE SEVERAL TIMES, BUT IT KEEP A CONSTANT FLAT PLANE( IN OTHER WORDS IT DID CHANGE ALTITUDE), THE FIRST SHAPE WAS A TRIANGLE, THEN A RECTANGULAR SHAPE, THEN SQUARE, AND FINALLY BACK TO A TRIANGLE. THE COLOR WAS ALMOST TRANSLUCENT, BUT IT DID HAVE A SILVER METALLIC SPARKLE TO IT. THE COLOR APPEARED WAVE, LIKE WHEN A FLOCK OF BIRDS ARE FLYING THE WAY THEIR WINGS MOVE UP AND DOWN. WHEN IT CHANGED SHAPE NOTHING BROKE OUT OF FORMATION. IT WAS PERFECTLY SEMETRICAL. WE LOOKED AT EAH OTHER AND TRIED TO FIGURE OUT WHAT WE SAW, THEN WE LEFT. THE NET DAY MY CO-WORKER TOLD ME THAT HE HAD SEEN THE INFOMUS BLACK HELIOCOPTERS FLYING AROUND IN THE DIRECTION THAT THE CRAFT WAS HEADING. ANOTHER CO-WORKER SAID THAT HE ALSO WITNESSED THE BLACK HELIOCOPTERS FLYING AROUND. THERE IS AN AIRFORCE BASE CLOSE BY AND I KNOW FOR A FACT THAT THEY DO A FEW STEALTHS STATIONED THERE. I DON&#39;T KNOW FOR SURE WHAT WE SAW, BUT SOMETHINGS NOT RIGHT. IT JUST SEEMS A LITTLE TOO WEIRD.<n>

Initial reports state that perhaps the local plant was emitting fire balls from released gas into the sky. The local plant however ruled this out. Deputy ((name deleted)) arrived in Notrees in time to see bright lights hovering and descending in a slow manner. Contact with oilfield worker, ((name deleted)) working on ((name deleted)) Oil Company well # 34-97 stated to deputy that this had been going on for about 30 minutes. Deputy then arrived at the mobil home of retired school teacher, ((name deleted)) who reported the bright lights and her mobile home roof shaking a lot. Contact with the local Confederate Air Force reported no activity that night. However, the following day, 2 rented cars with men and one woman interviewd people in Notrees TX. They answered no questions however. Some intervied claimed that the people seemed military in their speach. radio kchx and kmrk had some calls about the incident in the morning shows, as well as cbs affilite kosa channel 7.<n>

No engine noise and travelled slowly. Object emitted pale-white light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am a biomedical scientist and my wife is a business owner. I noticed an egg-shaped object travelling slowly towards Southwest from Carmel Valley. The object was visible from 17:50 to about 17:59 PST (complete darkness) and had an approximate altitude of 1,000 to 1,500 ft above ground and 2 to 3 miles out. The object had two or three strobe-lights. Their apparent location was on top of the object and on the bottom of the object, and one at or near the tail region. The strobes flashed top-bottom--top-bottom--pause-tail-top-bottom ... the tail strob could have come from an object following the first at close distance. The object emitted a pale, white light and appeared to have dark, window-like areas. I was unable to hear any engine sound, which at that distance should rule out any conventional helicopter. It could have been a blimp, but the egg-shape and light emitted from the object would rule that out. I managed to alert my wife who can corroborate my observation and take several digital pictures of the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness forwarded eight digital photos of object.  They are interesting in appearance, but unambiguous identification of the object is not possible from the photos.  Text of follow-up report included below.))<n> <n><n> <n><n> Classification: UNCLASSIFIED<n> <n><n> <n><n> Dear Mr. Davenport,<n> <n><n> <n><n> thank you for your interest. Here are more details:<n> <n><n> <n><n> 1. Other witnesses: the ones I know are my wife and our 5 year old daughter.<n> <n><n> I noticed it when turning into our street while driving home. Given its size<n> <n><n> and the illumination, it should have been noticed by anybody in Carmel<n> <n><n> Valley at that time. My first thought was, why is a coast-guard helicopter<n> <n><n> hovering over our area, but after a closer look I noticed that the shape was<n> <n><n> too round to be such a helicopter, plus the object was illuminated, which<n> <n><n> would not be the case for helicopters, and also there was no red painting on<n> <n><n> the object. The object seemed to radiate a dim light all over the surface,<n> <n><n> ruling out a search light. My second thought was that it was a blimp, but<n> <n><n> the shape was more egg shaped than cylindrical, and again the illumination<n> <n><n> radiating from the object would make it unlikely. In addition, it did not<n> <n><n> appear to have any carriage attached underneath, and window like structures<n> <n><n> were on the body, which would not be the case for a blimp. Given the<n> <n><n> proximity to Miramar, it could have been some experimental aircraft (I did<n> <n><n> not see any wings attached). Also, sunset was much earlier, so I do not<n> <n><n> think I saw a reflection of the setting sun at a higher altitude in the<n> <n><n> object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 2. When I first saw the object, it appeared to be stationary, but after<n> <n><n> getting my camera and following it carefully, it seemed to move towards<n> <n><n> South/Southwest about 1 mm/ min at a meter&#39;s length from my eye. It moved in<n> <n><n> a straight line and appeared to head towards Miramar. It did not make any<n> <n><n> engine noise, which I should have definitely heard if it was a helicopter<n> <n><n> from the distance I was at.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 3. I was facing SE and the object moved from left to right away from me. I<n> <n><n> will confirm this with a map and send it to you, since I never paid much<n> <n><n> attention to the direction our house is facing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 4. The apparent size when I first saw it compares to the moon in length and<n> <n><n> 3/4 of the moon in height. When I took the pictures, it was about 1/3 of the<n> <n><n> moon in size and when it disappeared behind a hill it was about 1/4 of the<n> <n><n> moon. It was much bigger than any star or planet.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 5. The pictures were taken by hand - exposure was automatic (probably  in<n> <n><n> the range of 2 seconds) the light appeared whitish-gray by eye, but looks<n> <n><n> more yellow on the picture. You should have received one set of 8 images<n> <n><n> (DSCN0080 through 0087), they look pretty bad and you will have to correct<n> <n><n> for my movements because I did not have a stand to put the camera on. I did<n> <n><n> not have binoculars handy unfortunately.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Let me know if you need exposure times for the images.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Sincerely,<n>

I looked down and shook my head in disbelief and when I looked back up it was gone. Was it a UFO? You decide.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

At first they were all clustered together, then they seperated into 3 groups. I live 16 miles from where our mail is delivered(77831), and am 18 miles from Huntsville Texas.  The clusters remained stationary for at least a half an hour, then they formed into one unit again as in the beginning... forming a vortex shape and then shooting straight upward at an extremely high rate of speed.  Faster than a rocket launch!  I JUST found this photo today, it happened to be the only frame left on my roll of film or I would have taken many, many more!  A friend suggest I submit the photo and information to you, even though it&#39;s &#34;dated&#34;.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Source indicates that date is approximate.  PD))<n>

A bright meteor passed near top of sky but my attention was instantly drawn to an object [not related to the meteor]about the shape of a football and 3x larger than an airliner flying [floating silently] from north to south, sideways, rather than end to end. the bottom was gold and I think translucent. I saw the lights of Las Vegas reflect off bottom [no lights on ufo at all]. As it got past the south limits of the city] about Sloan area] the object disapeared because of no more city lights reflecting off bottom.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I remember seeing the same object in an online ufo picture taken in Las Vegas in about 97&#39;. I thought that pic was a hoax and obviously the Sanyo blimp.

11/1/99|New Orleans|LA|Cylinder|10 minutes|Black cylinders over French Quarter|4/28/01|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/017/S17249.html|449|ndxe199911| ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n> <n><n> <n><n> Black cylinders over French Quarter<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was browsing through your site to see if anyone from New Orleans has reported seeing black cylinder objects crossing the sky over the city.  I read a report of a someone who saw something similar to what I have witnessed three different times in the French Quarter and the Central Business District of New Orleans.  The report I read said in 2/01, the witness only saw one black object slowly moving across the sky.  Every time I have seen these objects there were two in formation, casually crossing the sky, all three times I witnessed them at dusk.  They move very slowly in a direct path from NW to SE across the city.  The most dramatic sighting occured the first time...I was on my balcony, in the late afternoon, on St. Philip St. with my friend, when I noticed the objects moving across the sky.  At first I thought they might be birds flying from Lake Salvador to Pontchartrain, as there is always an increased amount of birds in the sky at nightfall.  I soon realized they weren&#39;t birds and I told my friend to check them out.  He got a little freaked out by them but we watched them slowly move across the sky.  About the time they  had reached the Eastern part of the city, and I estimate they were over or near Lake Ponchartrain, an incoming airliner apparantly swerved at the last minute to miss them, the sound of the jet&#39;s engines increasing as the plane veered to it&#39;s right and up to avoid the objects which just kept on their course.  We were pretty amazed at the whole thing. I have seen the objects twice since then, both times at sunset and both times they were flying on the same course over the city.  We have a lot of Military  bases near us in Mississippi and Florida, and we often get F-15s and even those warthog planes flying over.  I suspect it may be aircraft from a base because of the routine in flight pattern and time of day.  But whatever they are, they aren&#39;t using jet propulsion and they aren&#39;t prop-driven.  They are just black cyliners moving slowly  across the sky and are un-affected by the motion of the wind.<n>
