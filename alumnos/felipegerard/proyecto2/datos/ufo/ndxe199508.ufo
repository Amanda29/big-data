Something "square" underneath, maybe doors.|11/2/99|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/001/S01243.html|1|ndxe199508| Sometime in August 1995, he believes, the caller arose to go to work.  He went outside his residence to start his car, when he looked in the morning sky and observed one peculiar light, larger than the moon, hanging in the sky.  Then, he realized there was not one, but two of them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They looked like round balls of light with different colors around them.  There appeared to be a square-looking object, which he interpreted to be a &#34;door.&#34;  Then he could see, he thought, something dark underneath the bright light.  The dark object appeared to be saucer-shaped, and black.<n> <n><n> <n><n> He got video footage of the object(s), which was aired on Channel 8 in Reno.<n> <n><n> <n><n> He will send written report.<n>

Two more went over in the next 10 minutes or so. I went inside the house to get my sister as a witness. After about 10 more minutes another one went over, passing from horizon to horizon in ablout 2-3 seconds. No sonic boom or sound was made. It was quite large, about 3 inches wide b/n fingers held at arm&#39;s length. Over the next 35 minutes about 6 more went over towards the East. All had a distinct triangle with three lights at the points. As  it went over, you could see stars diifused through the &#34;body&#34; of the craft which was very weird. It almost had a cloaking effect, something you would see on Star Trek. At about 2405 CST about 10-12 points of light went over in the Northern sky and halfway across the sky, they did a zigzag through weachother at tremendous speed. They were not meteors as they left no trail of debris or burn up. They went over the horizon and that was it. Reported this all to MUFON in Oct 95.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Primary observer: former Marine, law enforcement major in college Secondary: college graduate, business major lights: all white<n>

8/29/95 02:00|Elizabethtown|KY|Triangle|1 minute|Black Triangular shaped craft with 3 pulsating red lights.|12/9/03|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/033/S33435.html|11|ndxe199508| Black Triangular shaped craft with 3 pulsating red lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> First off, I have a horrible concept of time so the day and year are estimates.  However, my memory of the encounter is clear as if it happened yesterday.  If verification is needed, proof could probably be provided by contacting one of three sources.  First, one could contact The News Enterprise since a short article was ran documenting the appearance of the object.  This article noted that two witnesses had seen the object, two policemen in fact.  I&#39;ve no idea if they filed an official report on the matter but contacting either the Kentucky State Police post in Hardin County or the Elizabethtown Police Department might yield further information on the subject.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As for my encounter, I was driving home very early one morning around 0200 after playing Dungeons and Dragons with my friends at the comic book store I owned when I saw the object.  I was on Hutcherson lane, about a half mile off US1600 when I experienced a compelling urge to look up in the sky.  What I saw surprised me.  Hovering above a field, roughly 500 feet in the air (hard to tell depth due to visibility and no frame of reference) was a triangular shaped object that would have likely dwarfed a football field had it landed.  At first it was difficult to discern the shape of the object since it was black and I was viewing it at night, thankfully it was a clear night.  Due to the three orange/red lights, which seemed to pulse slowly, I was able to make out the silhouette of a triangle.  The craft just hovered there as I drove under it, making no noise at all.  As far as I know, the military does not have an aircraft with VTOL capability that can hover without noise for an extended amount of time.  The cops that viewed the object spotted it from Ring Road, as far as I know, I&#39;m the only one that got a close look at the craft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As for the article in the paper, it stated that further investigation into the matter would be handled by one of the government agencies (I forget which one they mentioned now).  A few days later after the initial article, it was determined that the &#34;craft&#34; was, in fact, reflections from the fireworks at the Heartland Festival.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I assure you, what I drove under was no reflection from fireworks (fireworks that were over well before midnight by the way), nor was I high, drunk or no medication of any kind at that time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

8/25/95 01:00|Morris|AL|Other|40 seconds|There was a roundish object with glowing, shifting lights lining the edges of the craft as it hovered silently above the trees.|11/20/01|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/020/S20517.html|27|ndxe199508| There was a roundish object with glowing, shifting lights lining the edges of the craft as it hovered silently above the trees.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had to guess a bit on the exact date and time of the event, as it was several years ago, and it is something I really don&#39;t go around telling alot of people about. I had just left a friend&#39;s home, who lived in the small town of Morris. I always enjoyed riding around and listening to music, and after driving a bit, I headed back towards his home, becuase the road he lived on was, at the time, somewhat secluded, and great for star-gazing(since it was away from city lights).<n> <n><n> <n><n> I pulled off the road, rolled down the window, and had the radio softly playing. I was digging around for some cassettes to listen to, and something caught my eye. It was up to the left, just over the treeline. It seemed quite large, and was moving very slowly. The lights on it were glowing softly, and not flashing in quick succession, as aircraft usually have. I am a UFO buff, but didn&#39;t think that was what it was at first; my guess was it was a helicopter. It was way too slow for a plane.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I turned down the radio and listened. However, I heard nothing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Now, at the time, I was unaware that some UFO sightings were marked by the lack of noise accompanying the craft, so it was a shock to see this thing hovering so low above the treeline, and not hearing a sound. I was totally scared. It dawned on me that it was not anything recognizable to ordinary citizens. I tried to convince myself that it was a sort of experimental thing maybe, that the military was working on. If so, they were pretty far from any bases.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then as I sat and watched, I noticed the colors around it seemed to melt into each other, much the way the Mars looks on a good night-- it went from orange to green to red, softly and slowly changing as it moved slowly above the trees, as if it were looking for something.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had determined in my mind that if this thing headed my way, I was going to speed up the street to my friends house, who was only about a 1/4 mile away. My heart was pounding. It was hard to really make out the exact shape, but it seemed roundish, with lights all around the base. As I said, time and secrecy has dimmed my memory a bit. Though I know if I saw it again, I would KNOW what it was!(And I have, but that is going ahead of myself.) Then it did what I hoped it wouldn&#39;t-- it stopped in mid-air. I froze. My hand was on the key getting ready to crank the car and take off. I watched it as it began slowly rotating in a circle. Then after a few rotations, it began moving off behind the trees, back towards town.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Since it only seemed to be about 2 miles away, I decided to chase it. I was scared, but I hoped to find someone who mihg tbe stopped on the road who also saw it. I sped off in the direction it went, but the whole way back to town, I never passed a single car! Typical.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was a long time before I told anyone, except my friend, and I swore him to secrecy. He said he believed me because he could tell by the sincerity and seriousness in my voice that I was not playing around.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As a sidenote: a year or two later, NBC ran a UFO special one night, and they showed a re-enactment of some policemen in a small town who had seen three UFOs. They described what they saw, and in the video re-enactment the UFOs looked exactly like what I saw that night! My mouth hit the floor, and my heart raced as I was suddenly taken back to that night. It was a Wednesday night, and my wife wasn&#39;t home(she had gone to church). So it was frustrating once again not to have something tangible to show someone that would help validate my experience. I keep hoping to see that special again, or that maybe I will find photos resembling what I saw, but I have yet to come even close.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  The date is approximate, and we have arbitrarily assigned a date, such that the report will sort to August 1995.  We note the similarity between this report, and a very dramatic incident that occurred over Ontario, Canada, and western Pennsylvania on Friday morning, August 25, 1995.

The other 3 were at 120deg. from each other.This happened from 22:00 to 22:30 1000m from Canada&#39;s Wonderland parking lot.Approx. 50 people were standing in the parking lot pointing upwards at the object. On the way home(00:15)heard three loud bangs(six sec. apart)accompanied by truck getting bright each time.Then saw white tear drop object with long halo and tail surrounding it. Taped video of meteor over Toronto on news the next day.Didn&#39;t look like tear drop object so ran tape slow motion and on 8 frames saw diamond object going up to meet meteor.This really occured. Did some research and found out that an object had struck somewhere in Windsor and caused a fire.A small basketball sized object had landed in Geogian Bay. Windsor is West of Toronto and Georgian Bay is approx. north. I don&#39;t see how a meteor could split in two pieces and these two pieces go in such different directions given the velocity of a meteor. There were many witnesses to this event.

As it came closer to our position, it was moving west to east, I realized that the lights were all part of one craft which was triangular in shape and a fourth light underneath became visible as well.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When it was nearly overhead I pulled my van over and got out, much to the dismay of my children and a friend who was following behind, she kept screaming to get back in my car but I couldn’t I just could not believe my eyes.  The craft seemed to then hover directly over my position and I was looking directly up at the middle light which glowed a yellow reddish tone while the outer lights where more a blue white tone.  They didn’t flash or blink, nor was there any detectable noise though the huge craft was maybe 100 feet above me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The craft measured approximately 60 to 70 foot across (front being decided by the direction of motion) and was dark in color.  It was just after dusk so to be able to distinguish whether it was dark blue, grey or what, I only know it was a dark color with three lights around the perimeter at its triangular points and one underneath.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The whole incident took nearly 4 minutes and I got the feeling we were also being scrutinized by the craft’s occupants as we were doing the same to them.  Then the head lights of a third vehicle flashed behind me my gaze went to the oncoming car then quickly back to the craft.  Then without any sound which was audible the craft rapidly accelerated until it was a mere flash, in a split second it was gone moving eastbound at a rate of acceleration impossible for any known craft to do going from a stopped hover to a speed at which the lights began to blur as the craft raced off to the east.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have not reported this incident until now as I know people will think I am nuts but I am a Licensed Practical Nurse by profession and trained to observe and report, though this incident is permanently etched into my memory.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The other driver, the friend who was following is afraid and refuses to report the incident.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.

My ex-girlfriend and I were awake, talking as we began to fall asleep.  Then my ex nudged me and asked what the light was on the window shades (which were pulled down half way).<n> <n><n> <n><n> I looked at the shades and noticed a flickering light sort of.  I told it that it was probably heat lightning.  Then a moment later she nudges me again and asked me to go take a look.  Now the bedroom had two windows which were looking right into the back yard.  Also, there were some woods and a pond behind the house as well.  The pond was about 60 yards from the window view.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I got up and went to the window on the left, and my ex went to the window on the right.  I looked out the window and saw what looked like someone walking in the woods with a flashlight.  That&#39;s what the flickering must have been.  I told her that either someone was walking in the woods or even might have been fishing in a boat and they were using a flashlight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> She then told me to look to the left, that she saw a light on the water.  I looked and saw a light reflecting off the water from a house on the other side of the pond.  But then I leaned forward to look to the far left (which is not where she was looking)just to see if anyone else was out there.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What I saw next shocked me.  In fact when I saw it, I couldn&#39;t even move, it&#39;s like I was paralyzed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There were 4 balls of light, each about 4 or 5 feet in diameter, and each a soft but bright white.  The four balls were rotating around a central point, each spaced equally from the next.  The balls were rotating slowly in a clockwise direction, and as a whole, were also moving away from the house to the left behind some trees.  They were hovering above the water about 3 feet.  Before going out of sight, the balls began to pulsate in intensity.  After a couple seconds, they simultaneously changed color to blue then red, while still pulsing.  I don&#39;t recall which color they went to first, but those were the 2 colors.  All the time they were pulsating, rotating and moving as a unit in an easterly direction over the water.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My ex-girlfriend did not see these balls of light, because I was in such an immediate shock  I couldn&#39;t move and I couldn&#39;t tell her.  I was sweatting from every pore of my body.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As soon as the balls of light went out of view, another strange thing happened.   We both witnessed this.  From above the trees where the balls of light had gone, a very bright white light began to &#34;scan&#34; the small patch of woods to the left side of the back yard.  My grandmother was living in a small trailer right at the water&#39;s edge at that time and the light had gone systematically left and right and down level by level until it completed...It even &#34;scanned&#34; my gandmother&#39;s trailer.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In an instant, the light disappeared then instantly, our backyard had been systematically &#34;scanned&#34; as if the light was directly above our house.  Then, the light was gone for good.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Notes on the event:  there was complete silence, no crickets, no tree frogs, no wind, no sound whatsoever, even the source of the lights was completely silent.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am a customer service rep and technical sales rep., a college graduate and I graduated magna cum laude with a B.S. in Medical Technology.  My ex-girlfriend was from Italy, she had a B.S. in humanities.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date may be approximate.  However, a dramatic sighting occurred over western Pennsylvania at 00:40 hrs. on Friday, August 25, 1995.  Please see reports on the NUFORC website for this date.  PD))<n>

I went about a quarter of a mile down the road and saw a blue light about 10 feet above the trees, about a 100 yards away from the road.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It began to make a straight line toward the road as I was coming, then it cut to a 45 degree angle to intersect with me and my car.  I had the window down and the radio off, I looked at the digital clock and it read 12:44p.m., it kept getting closer to me, I was traveling about 20 miles an hour.  It got as close to 20 feet of my car about 10 foot above a thin tree line, it was almost baby blue, 10 foot sphere that made no noise and did not move up or down in the air, it went straight, almost like hovering.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So I did what anyone would do in my situation, I gased my car to the floor, still looking out the window, it just took off, and as I was still flying, I looked at the clock and it read 12:45p.m., needless to say, I drove home in about 3 minutes, that is 7 miles. I have not seen it since.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Many other reports of this incident.

I immediately got up and went towards the window and saw this large hamburg shaped object moving across the tree tops in the back yard about 50- 75 ft.high.  It turned everything blue including me and the bedroom.  I woke my husband but by that time it had passed (about 15 seconds).<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was living in Niles, Ohio, at that time (August 25, 1995) 12:42 a.m.  I was in bed and noticed in the distance bright lights coming towards my home.  As it got closer it was a large  blue/green colored spaceship with four large lights or windows.  The blue rays came down through the trees and lit up the back yard and bedroom as well as myself.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I got away from the window because I was&#39;t sure if it was coming down.  I would say it might have been approximately 25 ft. in diameter.  It is hard to judge size when in the air.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It came from north and curved around to the east very quietly.  It only appeared for about 15 seconds and then went out of sight due to other trees and roofs of homes..  It was just above the treetops (50 - 75ft. high.)   It was shaped like a very large hamburg bun.  New metalic looking, with orange lines on the surface, rays of blue lights lights coming out of bottom and four large windows or lights on front.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with this witness via telephone, and we found her to be seemingly quite credible.  We received many other dramatic reports about this incident, which was seen over Ontario, Canada, as well, where it generated several news reports.  One news camera crew caught the object on video, and it clearly was not a typical fireball or meteor.  In addition, the video, a copy of which NUFORC received from Amy Hebert, a UFO investigator from The Colony, TX, clearly shows a small, bright object rising from apparently ground level, passing behind clouds in the distance, and perhaps merging with the &#34;fireball&#34; as it passed overhead Canada.  The object was reported to have stopped and hovered over southern Pennsylvania.))<n>

The object took about 4 seconds to traverse this entire distance. The object appeared to move at a constant velocity without acceleration.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object was emanating bright light of a strange blue-green tint.  It was not as bright as a car&#39;s headlights.  The object appeared to have a precise circular cross section.  (I was struck by, and focused on, the object&#39;s precise edges.)<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object did not trail a plume or any other meteor-like scatter.  The object was dark at the top and near the center, and I could discern various precise geometric structures in these darker area, as if they were mechanical or machine-like.  The object displaced abou 1/2 steradian, equivalent to that displaced by the moon:  therefore, the object appeared to be the size of the moon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I believe the object was quite distant from me.  Just before the object reached the left-hand horizon, it emitted what we physicists call an S-wave.  That is, a spherical &#34;bubble of light&#34; emanated from the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This spherical &#34;bubble of light&#34; obviously was not travelling at the velocity of light, but it was moving very fast, possibly faster than the velocity of sound.

Then on the last night something compelled me to walk to the edge of a river bank, I was not sure why my interest suddenly grew but I left my dad who was cooking by the fire and proceeded to the water. When I looked up I paid attention to a specific star that was just below the big dipper, suddenly it began to move in a western direction, after 10-15 seconds it stopped and went back to the east, this continued and the bursts continued at different speeds, after a few &#34;laps&#34; in the sky it began to make a zig zag patter &#34;Z&#34; after making a star pattern in the sky it stopped one last time for about 5 seconds before shooting straight up and disappearing; I walked back to where my dad was and he did not say if he did or did not see the light in the sky, since then my experience with sighting ufo&#39;s has increased…<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

I was looking out into my backyard, and a large red light, with a smaller white one (neither flashing), slowly travelled from the west to the east.  After coming into my view, it passed behind some buildings (about half a kilometer away), then seemed to be travelling north, stopping (from my point of view) behind a tree in my backyard.  It immediately reappeared from behind the tree and travelled back the way it came, repeating this 4 or 5 times.  It wasn&#39;t making any noise, and didn&#39;t seem to be moving in any way that a plane would move.  It was travelling about as fast as you&#39;d expect a plane to travel, though.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

As we were watching a small light dropped out of the cloud on our right side then a second later another one dropped out of the left side.  They both hovered there for maybe 5  seconds, with the one on the left being a little higher in the sky than the one on the right.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then they took off to our left ,,,which would be east,,,and were gone in a flash.  The cloud continued toward us looking like it was going to pass right over us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My girlfriend at this point grabbed our 3 year old daughter, who was asleep and ran in the house being very scared that it was going to do something to us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I followed her in the house and got my binoculars. When I went back out it had gotten within 500 yards of our house and with my binoculars I could see in the cloud and saw a huge ship with windows and doors  made of some dark kind of metal.It made a light sound like the wind blowing very light but the lightning type flashes made no sound at all.I watched it as it moved slowly to the north at about 10 mph.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

I noticed|8/7/07|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/057/S57890.html|76|ndxe199508| At approximately 4 a.m. I wass sitting at at truck stop off Interstate 26 near Bowman South Carolina doing some paper work.  I noticed from just above tree level a craft surrounded by lights emerging from just above tree top level.  At first it appeared to be a small triangular object decorated with lights such as a hang glider.  Then as more of the object drifted into view it appeared to be one huge object that was made up of three smaller triangular objects.  Almost as if three hang gliders were attached together making up a larger triangular object.  As more of it became visible and it drifted into full view I realized that it was not hang gliders due to the enormous size of it.  It was almost silent.  Perhaps a small engine sound was barely audible such as a putter or hum, but not sure about that.  Then just as if it realized that it had drifted into a populated area it stopped, hovered, then the lights blinked once.. twice... three times... then absolutely dark it went.  But it was bright night and you could still see the object hovering above.  It then made a slow lumbering change of direction back to the cover of the tree top canopy and away from the interstate.<n> <n><n> <n><n> If you&#39;ve ever seen the floating laboratory that scientists use to study the rain forest canopy in South America.  It is a floating helium filled raft like craft used by scientsts to drift over the rain forest and gather data and experiments.    This UFO was similar to that with lights.  I&#39;m convinced that it is definitely man made due to it&#39;s crudeness and slow mobility.  It probably is hydrogen cel or helium and is manned by military special ops types doing training<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

I&#39;m writing it as it was told to me. Around 0200, I was making my rounds in the factory I was working security for.  I was alone in the building and was making my check points when a phone on the ohter side of the building started to ring.   I thought it was odd.  It rang as if an inside call, single ring.  When I got there, I was about to pick it up and it stop ringing and another one crossed the factory started to ring without interruption.  As if the call was transfered.  As I made my way back to answer that one, another phone started to ring, then another and another.  Then all the phones started to ring at once.  By this time I was freaking out.  This was impossible!  As I sstood there, I looked up and saw the baloons on the ceiling begin to move as it blowing in the wind.  There was no wind and the baloon are secured to the cieling.  They are there to alert of gas deposites in the cieling by changing colors.  Then after several mins. of standing there every thing stopped.  I ran to a phone and called for someone to come up and stay with me.  As I was about to hang up the phones staarted to ring, including the one in on my hand.  I made my way to the nearest door ass I was over comed with fear.  When I got outside, I heard a loud humming noise above me.  I looked up and saw a disk shaped object hoving over the factory.  It was as big as the building, gray in color with red, blue and white lights circling around it.  There was a light green light coming from the object shooting down on the generator of the factory I was in the one next door.  From the outside,  I could still hear the phones ringing.  after several seconds, seemed liked hours, I light stopped and the disk shot straight up in the air.  At the same time the phones stopped also.  I then used the phone to call a freind of mine at a storage factility several miles away.  he reported the same strange things happening.  I had someone with me the rest of the night.  In the morning, upon inspection of the generators,  we say scorch makes on the vents and the generators had bur! ((name deleted)) out.<n>

I had goose bumps. Then I hit my friends leg and yelled look and they did and yelled what is that.The object then shot off north like the u.s.s. enterprise on startrek it left a shape of the ship after it streaked off and line after it left. It was like it was in two places at the same time. The ship was huge it made no noise. I yelled at two other drivers,the driver behind the car next to mine on my right nodded her head up and down and sped off. I could not catch her. I and my friend made a police report in dearborn.I also called airports,NASA,and FBI. They gave me a number to a scientist and he said he&#39;s studied ufo&#39;s since WW2 and said that&#39;s what we seen.

When I did wake up the blinds were lowering. I was scared. I told fellow employees and supervisors and no one disagreed it was unbelievable the cloud around the ship pulsated.the ship was a reddish orange like a phoenix.<n>

All of a sudden the dog started crying put its tail under her legs and hid, and then as if on cue this blinding red light came through the blinds and felt a humming in my body but could not hear anything, my girlfriend who was right next to me at the time felt exactly the same thing, we were both scared to death i have read a lot of books and seen a lot of documenterys on ufo&#39;s and aliens and this has convinced me and definately convinced my girlfriend who was not a beleiver in this.  we both tried to peer through the blinds but the light was just too blinding it was just hovering above our house and where we lived in redmond was on the top of a hill over a valley so there was absolutely no doubt that this is indeed genuine.  i now live in london and have done since early 1996 and i hope the zip code i gave you is correct because i do not have my u.s. license anymore and the zip im pretty sure is correct. this craft if i may call it that was incredibly bright and huge and would  be amazed if nobody else saw this craft, i cant stop thinking about this sighting it really has got me hooked on trying to find the truth behind all of these sightings and beleive me they do exist i just hope that a member of the public from redmond also saw this and could verify my story.…<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

A series of 3 lights in a trianbular shape under the craft. It was silent and slow moving. It came out of the northwest and was traveling south east at about 35 to 40 miles per hour.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was traveling home form work on I 88 west bound out of Chicago at about 9:00pm. Around Naperville road I noticed a line of lights in the distance about 20 degrees off to the right of the highway. It was very low in the sky. It was not in the flight path of either O Hare or Midway airport. As I continued west bound I realized that what ever it was would be passing directly over head in a few moments. As I came closer to it, I noticed that what seemed like a line of nine lights was a series of three triangles with three sets of lights in each. I slowed to 25 to 30 miles per hour as it passed directly overhead. There was no sound as it passed over the highway. The lights were to bright to allow any sighting of the craft itself, although the outline of the configuration of the lights suggested that the craft was V shaped wing. The altitude is only a approximation. If it were higher in the sky then it would be of a larger size, if it were lower it would be slightly smaller. I have flown ultralight aircraft and no a little about determining altitude from the ground level persective. Other cars had slowed down and were also looking up as it passed dircectly overhead. It traveled towards the very populated Naperville area.<n>

At the time, I was entering my senior year at U.C. Davis.  I am now a practicing trial lawyer.  I was returning home from a job training that had lasted all day.  I had consumed no alcohol and I wasn&#39;t under the influence of any drug.  I have never suffered from any delusion.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I was driving on the causeway, in the middle lane, I noticed two red dots hovering over my windshield.  At that point in time, I couldn&#39;t tell how high they were.  I could only see them from my peripheral vision.  I assumed I was being speed tracked by a police helicopter.  So, I tapped on my brakes to slow down, as I was speeding.  I could clearly see two red lights, one hovering directly over the other in a vertical position.  At this point, I was sure I was being tracked by a helicopter.  I couldn&#39;t see any shape, and my fear grew, because I was sure I was going to get a speeding ticket.  The red lights hovered only about 50 feet over my front windshield.<n> <n><n> <n><n> To my amazement, the red lights came to hover directly in front of my car, and suddenly white lights lit up and illuminated the craft and the entire freeway.  I was so shocked.  I looked around to see if any other cars on the freeway could see what I saw.  To my left, there was a red Jeep Cherokee with about 2-4 college girls.  I could clearly see the woman with light brown, shoulder length hair looking over her steering wheel, eyes fixated on the craft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At this point, the craft was still only about 50 feet over our cars.  White track lights lit up one after another to create a moving effect along the outer circumference of the craft.  The craft was shaped as if two low sloping cones were put together.  So, from the top or bottom I imagine it looked circular.  From the side view that I witnessed, it was diamond shaped.  The craft was silver in color and had no other edges.  The track lights would take about one second to travel along the edge of the craft; again, these side white lights were extremely bright, like flood lights.  The craft remained lit for about 3 minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> All of a sudden the very bright track lights went out, and one could only see the two vertical red lights.  The red lights then shot off westerly in the fastest acceleration I could ever imagine, leaving a solid red line in my vision.  Seconds later, I could see the red lights darting hither and to over the hills around Fairfield and Vallejo.  I could see this darting behavior for about 30 seconds to one minute.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The girls in the red jeep and I pulled off to the Mace Blvd exit in Davis, CA.  We both got our of our cars, screaming and yelling, &#34;Oh my God! Did you see what I saw?&#34; We asked each other if we had cameras.  Then, I got in my car and sped off to my apartment.  I screamed for my roommate and a friend to grab a camera.  I told them about the incident.  Then we went out toward Vacaville on Highway 80 West.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I could no longer see the red dot over Fairfield.  So I pulled off to an 7-11 store and asked if anyone else saw a UFO.  I got some really wierd looks, and my friends thought I was a bit loony.  When we were getting back into my car, we could hear loud sounds of jets.  We looked up and there were numerous Air Force jets, fighter jets, cargo jets, etc., flying in two or three separate formations.  They were flying low and we could all see well over 20 jets flying west in the direction of the UFO that I had seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It has been 13 years since I saw this event.  I tried to forget about it, but it has to be the single most influential event that has occurred in my life.  I live a pretty eventful life as a trial attorney, but this has never left my mind.  I think of this event often.  My memories of it are very clear.  The event has caused me to question many fundamental things about my existence, my religion, and my government, questions that are yet unanswered.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

At that current moment, for some strange reason, I thought &#34;UFO.&#34; I seen these four little creatures, aproxamatly 3-4&#39; tall. There were two down by my calf muscles. The other two were up higher, close to my waist. It appeared as if they were doing some sort of an experement on me. Then I blacked out. I woke up about 11 o&#39;clock. The four little creatures were gone. The light was still flashing, I forget exactly when it quite.

My husband was steering the boat and my daughters and I were enjoying the scenery. As I was looking tomy right, I did a &#34;double take&#34; because I remember thinking quickly that the arrangement of the hills looked different than usual. I saw an extremely large, silver disk hovering (no sound) in between two hills and the port holes, many of them, were clearly visible. It was suspended and I could see the remainder of the darkening sky around the edges of it. I said to my husband &#34;What in the world is that?&#34; As I kept my eyes on it I looked then at my daughters and I think they were looking at the shoreline thinking that I was talking about a pretty home or something. I looked at my husband and I don&#39;t think he heard me because he didn&#39;t respond to my question. I think the engine of the boat was too loud. He still looked straight ahead. Then the hill to the north began to block the disk and it went out of my sight. I thought I should ask my husband to turn the boat around but at that time I couldn&#39;t believe that I even saw what I saw. I never did say a word to him afterwards. I did tell my oldest daughter eventually. It&#39;s a difficult subject to talk about. I continue to tell myself that I didn&#39;t really see it - but I know that I did. The image is as plain as ever.<n>
8/15/95 21:00|Hampton|VA|Other|3-4 secs.|Two orange-red dots flying at very high altitude and exhibiting great speed and unusual manueverability.|11/20/01|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/019/S19846.html|98|ndxe199508| Two orange-red dots flying at very high altitude and exhibiting great speed and unusual manueverability.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am unsure of the exact time period when I observed these objects, but I believe it may have been around the time of the Hyakutake? comet event. I was standing on my back porch looking at a small area directly above when I observed 2 orange-red &#34;dots&#34; that in my best estimation were traveling several hundred yards or more apart and at great speed and altitude. Suddenly, one object turned toward the other object, and with amazing precision and speed came along side the other at now less than 50 yards away. Then they disappeared behind trees across the street from my house. I am now 34 years old and have been fascinated with aircraft(identified and unidentified)since I was about 8 years old. I am somewhat familiar with many commercial and military aircraft. I find myself compelled to look at them any time I happen to hear or see them in flight. In my judgement, these objects were easily at an altitude twice that of a commercial aircraft at cruising. I believe my perception of altitude was enhanced by my witnessing a meteor around 1987 while standing on the rooftop of a local 10 story building. The meteor&#39;s trajectory was virtually straight in from my vantage point. I was very fortunate to be in the right place and time to witness it from beginning to end. Furthermore, regarding the U.F.O.&#39;s, what truly amazed me was the movement of the one object that veered closer to the other was that it didn&#39;t fall into a position slightly behind the one that stayed on a straight path. It seems as though it turned , accelerated and then matched speed again with the other all in less than 1 sec. over the previosly mentioned distance of separation. In my opinion, these were not f-15&#39;s from L.A.F.B. or any other aircraft from anywhere around the Hampton Roads area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

It was some time ago when I saw this but thought I should document it as it was the most dramtic. I have had two other sigtings, one prior to this report and one afterward. My first sigting was in Scottsdale, AZ about Summer of 1982. I saw three red light that were in a triangular formation that spanned about the space of 3 to 4 football fields. It made no sound and was much lower than any aircraft would have flown. The odd thing is is that the three lights flew as if it was one craft. YOu could not focus on the space between the tiagular shaped lights. It flew off slowly over the Pima Indian reservation.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My second sigting, the one mentioned in this report was near Flagstaff, Arizona while camping. Two craft came over a bluff moving very slow. They were oval shape (I am not sure if they were oval shape or circular as I saw them from an angle) with the perimeter out lined in singular lights. After moment when the craft came over the bluff then came military jets moving at much greater speed and passing the craft. The two ships did a semi-circle around our position and went back over the bluf again. As they started to go over the bluff in the center of one of the craft a warm colored light came on and the faded off as if it was like a dimmer switch. the light in the center was about a 1/3 the size of the craft itself. The strange thing about this is I don&#39;t remember falling a sleep that night and was awoken a couple of hours later by a third person who was meeting us at our camp site. I don&#39;t remember falling a sleep.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The third time I saw somthing was the event over the Phoenix Valley a few years ago. I awoke out of a sleep and walked to the window and saw the lights over what looked like camelback mountain (I was in the east valley.) Why would I have awoken out of sleep to see this? Anyway, People think I am full of it when I tell them these stories but two out of three times I was with another person.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

But then two more lights came on at either end of the row and then the object turned into a V-shape and sped off at a high rate of speed in an eastern direction.  I had no witnesses though for by the time I said, &#34;Hey look at that!&#34;  The object had already disappeared from sight.  A couple years later I mentioned this to my grandma and she told me that my great-aunt had seen the same sort of object.

(These visits continue today on behalf of the Georgia UFO Group).  Each visit was in response to members of that community who were reporting multiple observations of unknown aerial activity.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Ths first visit was made on 15March98, taking along a team of MUFON personnel, including Field Investigator Jack Dowless who lives in that region of Georgia.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The witness was found to be a mature successful businessman who has for 12 years lived on the highway along which this upscale mountain community is located. The witness was found to be an intelligent and well read person, an active church member and an obvious PILLAR of the Murray County area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> His home was located at 2600 feet of altitude on the side of Fort Mountain overlooking a large valley toward Grassy Mountain to the north.  His north wall lets out onto a full patio, the exit being a huge glass wall/sliding door.  This area is within the Chattahoochee National Forest, abutting the remote Cohutta Wilderness. Location being about 70 miles north of Atlanta.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The witness was cooperative and requested to remain anonymous due to his church work and business ventures in both Georgia and Tennessee.<n> <n><n> <n><n> FI Jack Dowless conducted the interview with occasional questions from this writer.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The witness stated that on an unrecalled date in September of 1995 at about 5:00PM EDT, the weather was clear and sunny. To the NW, he observed an object out over the valley and it appeared to be teardrop in shape.<n> <n><n> <n><n> He estimated that it was about 300 yards from his home, essentially stationary, but with a tilting motion that also revealed the top. He got his nearby binoculars and about half of the 1 - 1 1/2 minute observation was made with magnification. He further described the object as seeming to be SOLID, and of a dull aluminum-type metal, about the color of galvanized pipe.  Addtionally he estimated that it was about 30-40 feet in length, 12-18 feet in width, thickness of 8-10 feet, tapering to 3-5 feet, with a canopy or cockpit-type of protuberance on top.  The witness also described a black &#34;hole&#34; that opened in the top center/side of the craft.  Clear but bright icicle-like rays were projected from the circumference of the hole out to a distance of some 50-100 feet.  After about 20 or so seconds, the hole closed and the craft resumed it&#39;s original appearance.  (Witness later told this writer the &#34;rays&#34; might be compared to the shiny tinsel icicle-like decorations put on Christmas trees.....they blow in a stiff breeze).  The object then suddenly vanished.  No unusual odors, sounds or other effects were noticed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The witness had sketched in detail what he observed.  Much later, the witness and his brother was watching a documentary on the Fox Network and got the &#34;UFO Hotline&#34; number.  His brother talked him into reporting the incident (brother lives elsewhere in Georgia).  This was corroborated when the writer later interviewed the brother on several occasions. During later discussions with the witness and his brother over the next few years, ALL DETAILS REMAINED THE SAME.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Due to the witness&#39; unobstructed view of the valley, mountains and sky, he stated he was in fact a regular skywatcher and  had some small interest in UFOs since they were always in the media.  He went on to describe some other events he had witnessed, as well as those of his neighbors.  Subsequent visits to this community to speak with other witnesses found his information to be absolutely correct.  This writer and other MUFON of Georgia personnel in fact personally witnessed a minor event from this location at a later date and subsequent to that, WITNESSED WHAT WE FEEL WAS A SURPRISING (!) UNEXPLAINED EVENT very near this witness&#39; home. (As one member described it.....&#34;That&#39;ll wake you up in the morning boys&#34;!......this particular episode will be described in a future posting to NUFORC).<n> <n><n> <n><n> Overall, subsequent interaction with this witness during later visits to Fort Mountain further established his credibility to this writer.<n> <n><n> <n><n> FI Jack Dowless indicated he felt that no conventional aircraft could be mistaken in this case due to the close observation, lack of sound and vanishing of the object.  He did speculate a bit about some advanced experimental aircraft due to the close proximity (about 55 miles) of the Lockheed facility located within Dobbins AFB north of Atlanta.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The above described craft remains UNIDENTIFIED to this day.  On 20Sept05, during routine review of the various reports at NUFORC, this writer noticed the witness illustration from the 2June05 St. Louis, Mo. report.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The similarity of that sketch to the Fort Mountain sketch is extraordinary.  This writer is currently forwarding a copy of said Fort Mountain sketch to NUFORC for further scrutiny.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Additional reports from the Chatsworth/Fort Mountain area can be found in the NUFORC&#39;s Georgia database after 15March98. As indicated, another is due to be posted in coming weeks.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Tom Sheets/Founder-Georgia UFO Group<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We express our gratitude to Tom Sheets, and the Georgia UFO Group, for sharing this report with NUFORC.

The color was degrees of brown colors. I stood up and punched my hand to be sure I wasn&#39;t dreaming. After a few minutes the craft began to disappear starting by its front (I mean from the direction it was heading to) just as an eraser was erasing it from the sky. When it was erased completely I went to the street and asked the neighbors about wither they saw it. No one saw it. After a few months one neighbor who lived in the next building in a high floor and is not very smart said that he saw the same view and remembered the beautiful decorations of the windows.<n>

The object went from one part of a forest to another and then back again, it did this for about 5-10 minutes. When the object was moving i opened the window and it was silent, I think it could have been running on electricity or something.<n>

We saw some truly spectacular lights up in the sky to the south east.  We pulled the car over, and watched for nearly a half hour.  It was clear that these lights were lightening up in some low-level clouds; never striking the ground (maybe 1500 feet? 2000?).  It was a semi-cloudy evening, extremely dry air, and warm (68-70 degrees)--no rain.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The colors lit up as red/pink, white, aqua, green and an ivory color.  After about 10 minutes of watching, (roughly 11:15) a Redmond Police officer pulled up and watched the remainder of the &#34;show&#34; with us.  Because of the odd lack of actual bolt lightening strikes and lack of audible thunder and the funky cloud cover, some of the lights actually looked oval or round, but it was clearly a reflection of the light off/in the clouds.  It was truly one of the most spectacular lightening shows I can ever remember seeing--especially in Washington.  The air literally felt and even smelled &#34;electric.&#34;   As you likely know, dry lightening storms are rare in Wa.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The &#34;storm&#34; appeared to happen in a very localized area of the sky.  Very near Union Hill, but I&#39;m sure it could have been seen by anyone on Novelty Hill and the Redmond Plateau (perhaps even Education Hill) as well and seemed to be contained to one &#34;group&#34; of very puffy, white, billowy clouds. For as long as I watched these lights, I have no doubt that it was just a very cool weather anomaly all friends and the Redmond Officer all agreed that is was lightening, albeit very strange lightening.  The color flashes would have been really wild if you were on top of one of those hills which are about 500-800ft in elevation.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As far as I know, the &#34;storm&#34; was never reported, which I thought was odd since it lasted for about a half hour and it was so vivid. I recall watching the news the following day to see if it would end up on the weather report, but if it did, I never caught it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It may be worth noting that the officer got no calls on his radio while he stood with us on the shoulder of the road, and he was with us for 15-20 minutes. I don&#39;t recall him radioing anything in either.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> Original Report:<n> <n><n> <n><n> Occurred : 8/16/1995 23:30 (Entered as : 08/16/1995 23:30)<n> <n><n> Reported: 10/18/2003 5:19:37 AM 05:19<n> <n><n> Posted: 10/31/2003<n> <n><n> Location: Redmond, WA<n> <n><n> Shape: Unknown<n> <n><n> Duration:5 minutes<n> <n><n> <n><n> redmond washington sighting 1995  in one evening in the summer of 1995, when i was living in redmond, washington i was in bed with my girlfriend and my dog was in the room in her basket, we were watching tv it was about half past 11 at night give or take 15 minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> All of a sudden the dog started crying put its tail under her legs and hid, and then as if on cue this blinding red light came through the blinds and felt a humming in my body but could not hear anything,<n> <n><n> <n><n> my girlfriend who was right next to me at the time felt exactly the same thing, we were both scared to death i have read a lot of books and seen a lot of documenterys on ufo&#39;s and aliens and this has convinced me and definately convinced my girlfriend who was not a beleiver in this. we both tried to peer through the blinds but the light was just too blinding it was just hovering above our house and where we lived in redmond was on the top of a hill over a valley so there was absolutely no doubt that this is indeed genuine.<n> <n><n> <n><n> i now live in london and have done since early 1996 and i hope the zip code i gave you is correct because i do not have my u.s. license anymore and the zip im pretty sure is correct.<n> <n><n> <n><n> this craft if i may call it that was incredibly bright and huge and would be amazed if nobody else saw this craft, i cant stop thinking about this sighting it really has got me hooked on trying to find the truth behind all of these sightings and beleive me they do exist i just hope that a member of the public from redmond also saw this and could verify my story.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note: Date is approximate.

I know it is fact and I always keep this with me as my life experience:  When I was between the ages of 10 and 13 (1993 - 1996) I attended YMCA Summer camp in Silver falls State Park in Silverton, Oregon. I remember one amazing experience I had involving triangular craft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My friend ((name deleted)) and I left our cabin group and stayed behind in the cabin area of camp, while the other children went to dinner. Alex and I lied down on a mattress pad outside of the cabins and were watching the stars. This area of Oregon has very tall fir-trees and we were watching the sky through a gap in the trees. From our right side a round bright white light crested over a large evergreen tree. It seemed to be no more than 30 -50 feet above the treetop. It moved closer towards us and as it did, two more lights become unblocked by the tree and a clear triangle shape was formed by these bright lights. The craft seemed to be the size of a large sized airplane. It was silent and moved very slowly. I remember expecting to see men repel from it on ropes, but it suddenly moved to our north and disappeared VERY quickly. Then in the horizon something caught my eye to our right side, I looked to the horizon through the trees and saw three bright white objects come together from different areas of the sky. These three objects formed a triangle of the exact proportions of the craft that had been close to us. To my amazement this formation suddenly accelerated vertically and disappeared into outer space. I kept my eyes steady in the sky, my eyes following its trajectory. Then I witnessed what appeared to be three stars break away from the night sky and come together to form yet another triangle with the same proportions as the first craft. This triangular &#34;star formation&#34; then suddenly shot across the sky like a meteorite, leaving a white streak in the heavens. Afterwards I asked ((name deleted)) if he saw the second and third triangle formations and he said “no”. When I asked him about the first craft, he seemed uninterested in discussing it. We never spoke of it again together and our friendship ended soon after that night. I rarely speak of this event. This was such an amazing encounter and when I read other flying craft encounters, I have never found one as interesting as my own.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

Suddenly I noticed something very strange in the sky and without even thinking there may be vehicle behind us I stopped the car immediately unable to take in what I could see. In the sky  ahead of us were five round white lights appearing to be linked together. From the distance we were they wqere about two feet across each circle of light. They began to move in a strange way across the sky still linked together like a sidewinder snake. Then they changed colour some red some remained white one green, then suddenly turned white again, broke apart and disappeared at enormous speed in different directions across the sky and disappeared. Throughout this whole spectacle my husband and I sat mesmerised in the car and didn&#39;t even speak to each other.(some ten minutes) After it was over I turned to him and said &#34;Did you see that?&#34; of course he had and I was glad that he was with me as no one believed us and I would have doubted my own sanity had I alone seen it.

I happened to have a perfect view.  What happened was impossible and I would like to talk about it more.  You can call me at 847-((number deleted)).<n> <n><n> <n><n> Please contact me this has been disturbing me for a very long time and I need to talk about it.  Thanks  Hello my name is ((name deleted)) this is a real documented case of something very strange that took place.  No one knows or is willing to talk about it now.  It was documented on the 10:00 news in Las Vegas about 7 years ago.  The Government said nothing they neither denied it or tried to cover it up. I along with several friends had a perfect view.  However I did not see the entire outcome this just ending.  If I saw the whole thing I think I would have locked me up in a mental hospital.  Who knows maybe it affected me more than I thought.  And that is why I&#39;m acting so strangely.   My friend or co-worker saw the whole thing and that was the last day I saw him.  He never came back to work because it affected him so much.  All you had to be doing was looking south at the right time and you would have seen an amazing sight.  What I saw lasted only several minutes and the main display only a few seconds.  It will be a day that I will never forget.  I believe it took place August 13 on a Saturday night around 8:30pm what year I don&#39;t remember anymore.  It was about 6 or 7 years ago so the date can easily be checked out.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At any rate I was pulling into the showboat hotel.  I was driving a cab at the time so you know I was completely aware of my faculties.  It has just turned dark. Right around 9:30 I saw my friend or co-worker standing over his van looking directly south.  Normally my first instincts would be to ignore him and get into the cab line as quickly as possible.  But he looked like he might be in trouble so I pulled over got out of my cab and asked him if everything was all right.  He said yes but look at this.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I looked where he pointed and I said so what there&#39;s nothing there.  Everything was pitch black all you could see was a nice clear sky and the stars.  You could see forever that&#39;s how clear the night was.  Then all of a sudden something happened.  I thought I saw a shooting star. Beautiful crystal clear white lights shooting straight up like something you might see at the end of a comet.  Little tiny crystals or like very tiny little white stars.  Millions of them shooting straight up about as wide as normal full size airplane from wing to wing.  They were so clear you could see every one of them.  Like I said I my first thought was like it was a shooting star.  But then I said wait a second this thing is going straight up beginning from several miles up.  A shooting star goes across not up that defies the laws of physics.  It went up for maybe half a mile before the lights started to fade a way.  When I saw that I went into a state of shock.  When the lights fizzled away a tiny ball appeared about the size of a helicopter.  Difficult to tell the size because of the distance between us maybe 20 miles or so.  The ball hovered and from that ball more light appeared like the first white light.  But this time the color of the light was red very bright red.  It came shooting straight out towards us.  It came outwards and moved down at the same time.  And when that light sequence faded another ball appeared just like the last ball.  Now there are two balls at least 300 yards apart.  Now more red light appeared the same as the other red lights.  But these shot straight across.  And when those lights faded away another ball appeared.  The three balls formed a perfect triangle.  The crystal lights that appeared like I explained did it precise formation.  Extremely amazing thing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Now you have three orange balls about the size of helicopters hovering for several minutes.  The more you stared into this thing the more you thought you saw an out line of  a ship.  But you couldn&#39;t be sure.  Then the lower right ball started to rotate and all three balls vanished and that was all I saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I discussed it with my friend and we saw the exact same thing.  But he saw the beginning, which I did not.  He said the lights came down from the stars.  He was so scared he took the rest of the night of and I never saw him again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was on the ten o&#39;clock news.  They did a short section on it.  With no answers then at the end of the news they said it was Elvis coming down to the mgm.   A lot of people who saw it convinced  themselves that it was all a fire works display.  But there was a problem with that.  The first problem was that it was completely silent.  The second problem was that the part I saw started half way up the earths atmosphere and was amazingly clear.  To this day I can&#39;t watch a fireworks display because it&#39;s way to primitive.  The next day no one would talk about it especially the news network.  When I told them I had a perfect view of it they just didn&#39;t want to hear about it.  Whatever this thing was it was huge.  The government can&#39;t hide things forever.  Eventually one time somebody will have no choice but to listen to the Aliens when they come.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I need to talk about this please contact me at 847-((number deleted)) or e-mail me at ((e-address deleted)).  I know Aliens exsist and I belief that this is a bigger cover up than Roswell.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

We were following each other on PA Route 15 along the Susquehanna River when we saw two spiraling fire balls directly above the state capital of Harrisburg.  One was bright orange and the other was bright white both with tails and were descending at 45 degrees intertwining each other as they fell.  We were heading to northern York county for a campout.  After we dropped off my car we traveled together and saw the same glowing orange and white fireballs about 25-30 miles south of the original sighting.  Since then, I&#39;ve seen hovering orange orbs on several occassions the most startling being a sighting in Tioga County, PA in a remote area near my family&#39;s cabin.  The orange orb just appeared as I was leaving my cousin&#39;s house across the valley and just sat there stationery for about a minute until it simply dissipated. I&#39;ve seen military-style flares before and shooting stars and this was neither. Around this time I was experiencing a number of paranormal experiences including ET dreams and visitations.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

It looked almost like a computer chip, all bumpy on the bottom.  No sound, maybe somelight wind.  It went over my head and next thing I noticed I was out on my drive-way, where I wasn&#39;t a minute ago.

I looked up through the windshield and observed a very small dull gray disc shaped object hovering just above and in front of my car. I got out of the car and felt a pressure coming from the object like wind, but it was not wind........It made my hair fall back on my head. Closer observation showed an almost black area underneath the object. It only hovered for about 45 seconds somewhere around 50 feet up in the air and then it shot upward without any sound whatsoever. After it departed, a white substance came floating down to the ground. I picked this up, and to this day I still have it in a sealed bottle.<n>
8/12/95 03:30|South of Sarasota|FL|Changing|~5 minutes|Proximal sighting of shape shifting, falling leaf UFO.|6/4/14|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/109/S109525.html|137|ndxe199508| Proximal sighting of shape shifting, falling leaf UFO.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On or about 03:30 in the morning of Saturday, August 12, 1995, I was witness to what can only be described as a genuine UFO sighting on I-75 Noth bound, just south of Sarasota, Florida.  I say to have witnessed a UFO, not claiming it was extra terrestrial in nature, but, a flying craft that was unidentifiable.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am former miilitary, and I will not describe the nature of my military experience other than to state that I am very familiar with most if not all known aircraft, whether civilian or military to make any identification of such vehicles with a certain degree of accuracy and confidence.   What I saw on this occasion, is entirely foreign to my experience and remains so nearly 20 years later.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On the afrementioned morning, I was driving a 1992 Ford Taurus, a vehicle kept in excellent mechanical condition, traveling on North bound I 75, on my way from Hollywood, FL, to Tampa, FL.  As I began to approach a very well lit section of the interstate, some 10-12 miles South of Sarasota, Florida, I caught sight of what I first took to be a rotary wing aircraft in distress.  At this point, the interstate is divided by only a 40 yard or less median, and the craft was above the emergency lane on the opposite side, or on the South bound side of I75.  The craft appeared as a helicopter experiencing tail rotor failure of some sort, as it was descending in a seemingly uncontrolled fashion, pitching side to side and coming down like a falling leaf.  It dropped from about 500 ft to about 150 to 100 ft above ground in this fashion when it suddenly stopped, right above a tall highway light, to shine a bright beam of yellowish white light onto an empty, older model sedan, that was parked on the southbound emergency lane of I 75.   This craft was approximately 30 to 35 ft. In length, an approx. 10 - 15 ft in height, and 10 ft + in breadth, it had no windows, no wings of any type known, and overall this craft seemed to change shape and color, with an almost fluid manner.  As I approached this scene with! my vehicle, I lowered my driver&#39;s side window to get a better look, as got immediately parallel to it, being less than 120 ft. distant from its location.  As I passed it, outside of the normal rush of air noise, the other vehicle made absolutely no sound, it was noiselessly hovering, frozen in place.  The surface if this craft seemed to have a multi faceted airframe, and was oblong shaped. The facets on the surface seemed to change planar configuration , as the edges converged with one another to constantly change its outer shape without changing its dimensions.  The craft emitted what  seemed to be intermittently dull and brighter levels of light intensity in colors that were in the off white, yellow, dull orange and almost beige range.   The craft did not appear to have any visible signs of doors, hatches, windows or ports of any sort.  As I was experiencing all this with my head half out the driver&#39;s window, I suddenly became aware that my car&#39;s engine had shut off, and I began ! to struggle against the loss of power steering.  The craft remained motionless, still shining a beam of light on the parked vehicle.  I immediately turned my attention to my car, shifted the transmission to neutral and turned the key on the ignition, my vehicle started up again instantly.   I turned to look at the craft again, it was still there, however, within a second or so, it turned off its beam of light , and began to slowly ascend in a perfectly linear and vertical attitude, some 50 - 70 ft, when it suddenly, just vanished.  I did not see it fly off in any direction, I just saw it disappear, there was no more light or movement, just empty air.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Weather conditions on this date was slight to medium,  low cloud cover with the expected high humidity for that time of year, approx. 72 F.  All this took place in a time span of less than 30 - 45 seconds, and although I did lower my speed to about 40 MPH +/-, the actual experience seemed to have taken more than a minute.  Once the craft disappeared, it did not reappear again, and I have not seen anything like it since.<n>

It was foggy at the bottom of the hill and after starting up I saw it and parked onth e shoulder and stood dirrectly under it. It was triangular in shape. 120-150 &#39; across the back, 100&#39; back to front. It had 4 lights  down its belly. Simsilar to a florrecent light but no defined center. Completely silent I don&#39;t know if hair standing on end from ship or adrenalin. It just floated off into the fog in the valley. Igot back in my truck and hesded on west.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was leaving louisville Ky. on I-64 heading into In.. After climing the fist big hill I started noticing a lot activity in the clear sky. It was about 01:45 I noticed what seemed to be landing lights but a very stange shade of white. It&#39;s movement seemed odd also because it did not seem to be getting closer fast enough for it&#39;s size. It finally turned to the noth and after awhile I for got about it. 20-25 miles latter I caught ashight of the odd lights agiain still dirrectly in front of me. On this part 64 the road is hilly and curvey and I lost sight of it each time I went in the valleys. I came around a left hand curve and started up the hill and when I came out of the fog it was hovering over my lane at the top of the hill. I was almost at the top when I pulled onto the shoulder and jumped out of my semi and stood in the middle of the highway in my socks looking up at a triangular 100&#39; from front to back and 120-150&#39; across the back. It had 4 lights across its belly from front to back like aflorresent bulb but you could not see the center of the light. It seemed to be constant with no breaks on either end or down each side of its slot in the bottom of this ship. The air was completely still with not a sound comming from this craft.I grew up on Air Force base&#39;s  and have seen and heard just about every thing flowen in our inventory of air craft. I stood ther for 3-5 min. before it just floated off into the valley into the fog. the back of the craft was also triangular in shape. From  top to bottom 30&#39;. With twp small lights one on each side like tail lights. No sooner had it dissapeared then two trucks came around the curve and up the hill. Of course after it had left. I got back in my truck and one of them asked me if I needed any help. I can only say they did not see it. On the other side of the hill is tree small truckstops. I did not hear anyone talking on the radio about it so I guess no one ther saw any thing either.<n>

Slow day, so a few of us are hangin&#39; around outside helping one of the guys work on his car. We are in the parking lot of a small strip-mall. (Not all of these sightings happen out in cow country.) Two of us go inside to get a few sodas, on our way way back outside we hear one of the others yelling &#34;Get out here, you gotta see this sh*t!&#34; We ran. It sounded like an emergency from the tone of voice. So there we are a group of five all pointing up at the sky slack-jawed. The traffic just keeps goin&#39; by like theres not any UFOs dancing around in the sunset.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There were 3 &#34;craft&#34; from what we could tell. Each identical to the other, they were shaped like a discus and appeared to be a metallic color with a soft glowin&#39; white halo that surrounded them. They flew in perfect unison and in ways that seemed impossible, especially to what we know of as vehicular flight. It only lasted a minute or two but the lil&#39; airshow was spectacular. As they flew away (quite fast), it was like all 3 &#34;ships&#34; flew into each other and became one burst of light... poof... gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> One of the guys, the manager, comes out just in time to see the last half of it. He drops whatever he was holding. This is were I get confused. He can&#39;t believe what he sees... even while 5 of us point it out. He goes into complete denial on the spot. To this day I&#39;m sure he wouldn&#39;t admit to it. He didn&#39;t go into hysterics or anything like that, its just that He went back inside saying &#34;No. Nope. No way.&#34; Which was actually stranger than seeing what were probably our own creation. I should note that this happened not far from the Millington Navy Airbase NAS Memphis. (Formerly the largest by enrollment and most active training center for new Navy &amp; Marine pilots.)  We stood around outside, looking up &amp; talking for several minutes afterward making sure that we all saw the same thing.

My freind was telling a story of no real interest to me.  I looked up and saw what looked to me like a plane moving above without its lights on, just visible from what I thought was the reflected lights of reno on the bottom of it. It had the same color of the bottom of a cloud that has city lights reflecting on it. There were a few points of this dull orange glow that I thought were the wings and fuselage and other parts of a plane, in that they were moving along together.  It was not bright and nothing especially wierd about it.  I had time to think &#34; Why is that plane flying without its lights on&#34;  I think I said that interupting my friend, but as he continued his story, the individual points of dull orange split apart and seemed to orbit each other, swirling in a sort of pulsating sphere and then shoot of in all different directions.  I imediately had a wierd felling because the motion was so synchronized and so amazing I felt like it was obviously a product of some superior intelligence.  My friend thought I was joking.  The light had changed but there was no one behind me so I stopped for a minute and looked to see if maybe something was reflecting on my wind shield (with so many lights in reno) but I didn&#39;t see anything and the objects were completely gone. There was no contact of any kind with little green men so I&#39;ve just kind of told this story to people that were interested in this sort of thing but I can&#39;t describe accurately to people why the movements seemed so incredible to me.  The integrated maneuvers these things pulled off in a span of a few seconds were obviousely not done by some kind of normal aircraft.  Since that time I have heard so many different accounts of these formations of objects that I figured it happens fairly often but I would like to see if anyone else had seen something arround that same period in that area ( I dont remember the exact date)<n>

Light seems to scan area for about a minute. Object turns lights on and lands without making a sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Country setting in northern Wisconsin  with no other houses around. A heavy thunderstorm left the area to the east within the past few minutes.  The sky is cloudy with light mist and high dewpoint. Observer looking out from open window at field with distance swamp and woods(150 yards distant to the east). Woods and swamp are scanned by a dim red light that has no source(usually in high humidity a light beam will refect or be noticed in the heavy air). Ground area lit up the red light about 100 feet in diameter. Light moves around back and forth and it takes about a minute to cover about 20 acers of woods. Red light stops and object in sky at about an altitude of 300 feet and distance of 300 yards turns on 2 intense beams of light that point out level torward the horizon over the house. The souce of the lights move toward the house.I could see actual points that emitted the lights from an object but could not say what shape it was. The lights slowly turn toward the ground and the object seems to land where the 2 beams of lights lit up the ground in a depression about 10 feet deep and 150 feet across. On the ground the object spins around several times very fast with the 2 beams of lights turning back up into the sky at about 45 degee angle The lights go out,and nothing else is seen or heard. There was no wind that night and the object made no sound, it was a very still summer night. The landing site was about 150 yards away in a  depression with small trees. Observer felt that if it was a helicopter there would of been some sound and that by landing in a area of trees the blades would have hit them causing a crash. There was a lot of clear level field to make a safe landing if a helicopter wanted to. There are no helicopers based within 50 miles and no craft would of been up in that severe storm. Observer is a photographer 50 years old.<n>

It was my second year working there. On the second year I gradually developed the urge to start looking up into the sky. On that day I was speaking to a friend from a private business just down the hill, who walked his dog four times a day past the compound. We were discussing the possibility of UFOs and aliens, as we often did. At a point I complained to him something to the effect, &#34;I&#39;ve been watching the sky around here for a long time. I know other people have seen UFOs. How come I never seen any?&#34; Before long my friend and his Dog returned to their place down the hill. Approximately 45 minutes later, at twilight, I was listening to a program on my small radio and walking across the property from west toward the one building on the compound to the east. To my left, high in the sky; higher than most of the local aircraft flew in the area, and travelling a bit faster, was a lighted object traveling from north to south. I then said to myself, &#34;What&#39;s this?&#34; As I watched, the object began flying in an up and down pattern once, and then again, and possibly a third time but I can&#39;t be sure. But certainly at least two times. I never seen aircraft fly in this manner and I knew that no conventional craft could do that. The object traveled along after the unusual aerial display and then suddenly blinked out.It didn&#39;t burn out like meteors and shooting stars, but blinked out, and I&#39;ve witnessed enought meteors to know the difference. The sky was clear and light enough where I would be able to locate it in the event it had turned in another direction, but I could not find it. It was just gone. No acceleration, just gone, as if it had gone into another dimension, if you can imagine that. At that point I began to realize that I had just witnessed my first and so far, only UFO. And it showed up within 45 minutes after complaining out loud that I have never seen one. It was as though someone heard m! y complaint and decided to show themselves to me. My friend and his dog returned shortly after dark and I told him that I indeed had seen a UFO. My friend started to explain the UFO away but then started offering an explanation on how we on Earth began with the wheel and the aliens began with &#34;flight&#34; as if he knew all about something.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The next day I was working in Chula Vista making a patrol around a large motel and spotted a black car parked in the rear of the building with its windows so dark I could hardly see inside. The vehicle was not on the motel guest list. I won&#39;t go into detail the remainder of that incident.  But I&#39;ll end this by saying that my report is the honest to God truth exactly as I have told it. I swear on a stack of Bibles. I don&#39;t know what the object was or its origins but I never seen anything like it prior nor after it. I am retired military and observed many times aircraft in the sky, but again, nothing that came close to the lighted object and its impossible aerial performance.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

Both objects would from hovering would dart across the sky and stop for 10 to 20 sec. and take off to a different angle and stop again. Both of the ufo&#39;s played in the sky for around 35 min.. The odd thing was that The ufo&#39;s would dissapear Around 3 min. before a commercial plane would enter the area. The next day in Wendy&#39;s 2 airborne division men in dress came in to eat. There is no air base near by.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Around 1:05 am An obgect shoot across the sky and stopped in mid air. Usually there is 4 to 5 guests that hang around but this time there were just my roommate and I. A second object was spotted near by.  The ufo&#39;s from hovering would soot across the sky and stop in mid air. The objects looked like one of the clips from one of the earlier X FILES shows. Where the objects that were a little bigger than stars. would move in many directions and stop. The background was a clear night on the flat lands of Richmond KY . The ufo&#39;s would disappear minutes before a commercial airline would come through the area where they were at an appear later to put on a show again. Finally the ufo&#39;s darted off like a shooting star together to the west and would never appear that night. The next day we were at Wendys and 2 airborne division officers came in looking really tired from the night before. They didn&#39;t speak to each other hardly at all. They did look around the restruant at the people to! see who was observing them. There is no airborne  or base nearby in the area exept for the chemical storage base that has no landing strip that i no of (i&#39;ve have been there).<n>

I guess you could say I was looking out north to north east sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> While looking at the sky…its weird and hard to describe…I knew something “black” was gliding slowly by the sky kind of over the highway heading North Westward (from me it was about 2 to 3 football fields away).<n> <n><n> <n><n> The only reason I knew there was something there going by was because it blocked out the stars as it went.

I thought it was gone when I noticed their was three faint red lights in the shape of a triangle Two on the bottom and one on top.  The jet was really moving on us when the lights just took off at a unbelievable rate of speed.  Like nothing I have seen before.

8/1/95 16:00|Hull (UK/England)||Triangle|20 minutes|3 silver triangular objects over my house in 1995|2/22/02|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/021/S21764.html|191|ndxe199508| 3 silver triangular objects over my house in 1995<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was upstairs in my house one afternoon. I was stood up, when, through the window, I saw something moving in the sky. It was about 500meters away. At first it seemed as if it was 1 object such as a large piece of plasic caught up in the wind. I could see that it was slowly moving in my direction. As it came closer it was obscured by a large tree in a neighbours garden. But a minute or 2 later it appeared from behind the tree and I could see that it was in fact 3 seperate objects moving together, but never touching each other. As they got nearer I could see that they were 3 silver triangular objects. They were flying/floating in a triangalur formation, and each was slowly turning. As they turned individually, they also turned together as a group at the same speed. They were a dull silver colour, and every so often lights would appear from the corners of the objects. The lights would come on quickly and then fade away. The light colours would change, sometimes blue, sometimes red, sometimes yellow. The 3 objects passed more or less directly over my house. At this point I was leaning out of the window looking up as they passed over the roof. As they vanished from view, I ran into the opposite room and looked out of the window. A second or 2 later I saw them re-appear over the brim of the roof. I watched them for another 10 or 15 minutes before they vanished from view. They always moved in a perfectly strait line and although they were close to each other they never touched. There was no sound, and all the time I was trying to think about getting a camera (but I had no film). My girlfriend hadn&#39;t arrived home from work (she thought I was quite mad when she returned). I never felt in danger, and just wanted someone to witness it with me. My heart was pounding, and I&#39;ll never forget it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  There were several dramatic sightings reported from other parts of the world during August 1995.  PD))<n>

The moon was out.  Suddenly, I hear a really loud sound.  It sounded like an airplane flying overhead.  Then I see this object come flying down from the sky and it was shaped like a stick-figure bird (silver)(I could draw it).  It had a red, blinking light at the tale.  it flew down from the sky, at my eye level, but on the other side of the street.  It was flying fast and zoomed by window.  I screamed for my boyfriend to come look and he saw it too.  Then it seemed like the object new it was being watched becuause after it passed my window, about two block down the street, it made a slow u-turn to my side of the street, and was coming slowly toward my apt. building.  Now it was much quiter.Right before it reached my window the object turned into this huge, black pyramid/trapezoid shape, with a loan yellow light blinking a little above the middle.  It slowly passed my window, a few feet above my head. After it passed my building, it changed back into its original shape and flew up into the sky.  It went over my apartment building, high in the sky.  I ran out my front door and watched it fly over some trees in the distance.<n>
8/1/95 00:00|London|OH|Teardrop|30 minutes|Interaction with 1 of 3 objects in the direction of Wright Patterson AFB.|5/15/13|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/097/S97727.html|194|ndxe199508| Interaction with 1 of 3 objects in the direction of Wright Pat Air Force base<n> <n><n> <n><n> In the summer of 1995/1996 (unsure of exact year), I worked until 11:30 PM in a city 30 minutes from my home, which was west of my job.  For three weeks, myself and many coworkers (several of us from the same home town worked at the same place at the time) noticed three lights moving in set patterns west of our work. These lights could be seen from a number of roads, including Interstate 70.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The three lights moved in distinct, elongated circular patterns.  Looking out of the windshield of my car: on the left side of my view, light #1 moved up &amp; down towards the horizon and back up while light #2 moved right to left, low along the horizon.  The odd thing about light #2 was that while you could track it visually moving right to left, once it turned around to head back towards the right, it would disappear and almost instantaneously re-appear on the right side of my field of view to continue the slow track left. It repeated this pattern.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Light #3 mirrored light #1 with two exceptions: 1) it was on the right side of my field of view and 2) when it crested the top of its pattern, it appeared to get bigger while it traveled down towards the horizon.   As it got closer to the horizon, it would get smaller. I assumed this to mean that, as it got bigger, it was coming towards me. Because of this assumption, I decided to try to get its attention.<n> <n><n> <n><n> During one clear, warm night on the drive home, every time I would turn towards the lights, I would flash my hi-beams at them.  This went on for about 15-20 minutes.  As I did this, I noticed light #3 seemed to get larger and larger every time it reached the top of its cycle.  As my drive took me through the more rural area of my home and my work, I pulled off the side of the road, stopped, and continuously flashed my hi-beams.<n> <n><n> <n><n> While lights #2 &amp; #1 continued their cycles, light #3 continued coming towards me.  Leaving my car running, hi-beams, lights and radio on (done purposefully to see if this “thing” would interfere with my car’s electronics) I stood as this object flew over my car.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object was dark (black or blue?) and shaped light a tear drop laying on its side with the pointed end assuming to position of its “tail.”  It also had 2 wing-like structures swept back at an extreme angle.  Each wing had yellow circles along the leading edge which I thought looked like port holes.  At the end of each wing, and on the rounded end of the object (which I assumed was its “nose”) was a pale yellow light, each shining down to the ground (like a spot light) though never actually reaching the ground that I could see.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I anticipated the object to be 100-200 feet above my car, and about 50 feet across tip to tip (though I can’t swear by these dimensions).  As this was a calm, clear, moon lit night, there were no clouds or wind, but the object slowly drifted over the top of my vehicle – no sound of any kind and no interruption in my car’s electronics.  As it got about 2/3 the way over the top of my car, I looked back towards the other lights to see what they were doing. There was no change in their patterns.  As I turned around to look back at this object, it was gone. No sound, no trace, no clouds to hide behind. Just gone.  Again, the sky was clear – no winds, no clouds and an almost full moon which was bright enough to create shadows.  As I finished the drive home that night, I never saw light #3 return.<n> <n><n> <n><n> For the next 4-5 days, though I was never able to get any further response from them, the 3 lights continued their pattern.  Then, less than a week later, these light disappeared and never returned while I lived/worked in that area.  I realized a couple years later, after doing some research, that these lights appeared in the direction of Wright Patterson Air Force Base in Dayton Ohio…  	Alien craft?  Government spy blimp?<n> <n><n> <n><n> I make no claims that this was (or wasn’t) an extraterrestrial craft.  I only am attesting to what I experienced.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date is approximate.  PD))<n>
