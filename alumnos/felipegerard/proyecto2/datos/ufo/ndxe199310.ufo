I was almost home and finished with my walk when I happened to look up and suddenly saw a triangle shaped object with 3 lights on the bottom (in each corner)- absolutely no sound.  I just stood there not believing what I was seeing.  I had noticed some kids out trick or treating earlier and I quickly looked around to see if anyone was out but there was nobody at that time.  I looked back up and I thought it had gone behind a cloud (I think the only one in the sky because it was a clear evening), but it was gone.  I ran to the house to tell my husband and some friends and we went outside to look but never saw anything else.<n>

Very close range. Red lights and yellow lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were travelling on our usual route home from a practice at 9:30 pm. As we approached the Shell gas station on Rt. 22 in Bedford I noticed a row of red lights above the station. Hmm, I never noticed a bunch of wires or something with lights there before, I thought to myself. Suddenly I noticed the lights were moving. (The sky was very dark, so at this point all I saw were the lights.) &#34;What the hell is that?!&#34; I blurted out to my child.  We turned the corner at the Shell station onto route 172 and I opened my window and kept driving and asked my daughter to keep watching it as it was now still on the drivers side but sort of traveling with my car.  I dont recall any other cars around us.  I opened my window to try to see it better and hear it.  The next thing I said was, &#34;The thing is HUGE!&#34; It was more of a feeling because I couldnt see it clearly. (It must have been black.) The shape was more implied than seen--triangular or possibly boomerang shaped, but very straight lines. There was absolutely no sound at all. I couldn&#39;t believe something could fly and be that quiet.  I kept thinking of some kind of &#34;glider.&#34;  Anyway, we drove along and it passed overhead and now it was on my right hand side. I finally stopped the car because it kept going to the north and I wanted to get a look at it, but it disappeared (downwards) behind the tree or brushline just before the highway (Rt.684).  When I first saw it I thought about the fact  that the Westchester Co. airport was only about ten miles away in the direction it was coming from, but I&#39;ve never seen anything like that from an airport.  My daughter and I went home and drew pictures of it (separately) to show our family. I never reported it to anyone, but I have recently heard a couple people describe the exact same thing......We were not frightened, just interested, and when the thing was going out of our sight we could see yellow lights as well as red.  I remember back 15 yrs or so there was some kind of ufo sightings or hoax or something regarding the ai! rport at Stormville. I am not a UFO buff. This is the only one I have ever seen in my half-century of life. Sorry this is so old. Do you know what this could have been?<n>
10/27/93 21:38|Wanakah|NY|Triangle|0:07|A Sighting that left us running|2/1/07|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/054/S54882.html|4|ndxe199310| A Sighting that left us running<n> <n><n> <n><n> Sighting Report  	I wish to report an unusual sighting of an apparently singular vehicle that I observed along with my younger brother and neighborhood friend (3 observers total). The UFO in question appeared over the night sky just like any other aircraft we’d seen; Niagara Falls AFB was just up the road and we were used to unusually loud and streaking aircraft, we’d actually spent many a night interrupting our teenage nighttime endeavors to look up and identify a particular jet noise.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I grew up in a house that was situated last on the left, on a street that began at the Lakeshore, and wound up to the Conrail tracks. Subsequently, my parent’s backyard looked sprawling, but the backyard landscape was primarily the property of first, Niagara-Mohawk, and then obviously, Conrail. (The first three, the last track, I believe was the property of Norfolk &amp;Western). We, as kids, quite often used the Electric Company’s dirt-utility path, which obviously followed the tracks, as a sort of rendezvous point. We basically spent more time on that path, than on our own street. We’d generally walk the path to the corresponding neighborhood, to meet with friends. The particular night that this sighting occurred was indifferent to any other given evening. The three of us walked to our point to meet with a few buddies.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We’d arrived at our usual location, which stopped just short of a viaduct bridge that over passed the next main road. We were there a total of 8-14 minutes when we heard the rumbling of an aerial vehicle. It initially sounded like a heavier aircraft, and I looked up to search for something like a 737 or a CRJ. Instead I witnessed what appeared to be, in my mind as a 15 year-old kid, a military craft of some sort.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It approached our vantage point from the southern-tier and appeared at first to be a typical vehicle. We only looked up because we were bored of waiting for our friends to arrive, and the noise was a bit unusual. The craft sailed along the sky just like any other large aircraft, but we watched it because we, at the time, had nothing better to do.<n> <n><n> <n><n> To elaborate in a manner as precise as possible, the vehicle appeared to follow a typical FAA-dictated glide path. We only became startled when the noise appeared to magnify about 2-3 times its initial offering. This acceleration was enough to make us suspect that something was wrong with the aircraft, so we continued to watch, and I guess, kind of searched for cover, just in case.<n> <n><n> <n><n> To our surprise, the craft rapidly accelerated across the horizon, and the associated noise dimmed significantly. Actually, the craft in question bolted across the horizon, and we ran away from the scene with all the leg we had. This sounds a bit pathetic, but we actually hid in my buddy’s garage for a few hours.<n> <n><n> <n><n> To describe the particular craft as accurately as possible, it appeared to be triangular, at least in light-scheme. The vehicle possessed no observable wings or tail. It approached our vantage point from an apparent SW vector and was around 15,000 ft. altitude. The noise that it produced and the associated light-burst sent us running away so that’s the best I can offer. The craft simply made a mockery of the sky, and the hideous sound it produced beforehand was enough to set off our fight or flight response.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date of sighting may be approximate, although the witness does not indicate that fact.

I&#39;m not quite sure if I have to tell my personal experience in this forum...considering the majority of skeptics on UFOs. But I feel that there is a need to discuss this subject, because knowledge of what really happens in our universe could be essential in determining where we should be heading.<n> <n><n> <n><n> First of all, I would like to introduce myself. I am a lawyer in the Philippines. I currently holds a public office as the City Legal Officer of ______________, you can check this out in our website. I am the head of the City&#39;s Legal Department and had been a practicing lawyer for more than 11 years now. I had been a lawyer for many nongovernmental organizations. I am an experienced trial lawyer. As such, I know what &#34;facts&#34; means and what &#34;evidence&#34; can play as a way to convince people of the existence of a fact.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I was 16 years old (around March of 1987), about to graduate from high school, i was walking my dog around 8:00 PM. It was a bright night because it was almost full moon, with clear skies with some relatively fast moving cumulo-cirrus clouds (it was a bit windy). Our house was just 15 meters away from the seashore in ___________. I was used to stargazing, so I was looking intently at the stars as i walk my dog. I noticed some movement near the moon, i thought it was the cloud, but when i looked more intently, i noticed that it wasnt the cloud but a &#34;star&#34; moving very slowly. I first thought that it must be a night plane, but then the light wasnt blinking like most planes, so it suddenly occurred to me, &#34;could this be something else&#34;?  Immediately upon blurting that out in my mind, the moving light suddenly moved so fast in at least three circular paths, counter-clockwise.  Since I studied in a special science and math class since my elementary, I knew what the speed of light is, and i knew that that object was travelling at close to the speed of light (around 186,000 miles per sec).  I was shocked, because even at my age then, i knew there&#39;s no human aircraft that can travel at close to the speed of light. And after going in circles, it streaked the entire length of the sky in a semi-circle path.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Two years after, I was again in the same place (we havent left yet our residence near the seashore). I was simply strolling and letting time pass by. It was past 8:00 PM, again, with the moon (more than half moon). The sky was again clear, with visible stars and clouds. As i continue to watch out for falling stars, as it has been my habit, I saw some movement of one &#34;star&#34; in the location of my first sighting two years before. I got so excited that it suddenly occurred to me this wasnt coincidence. This time, upon my noticing of its movement, the bright object with yellow star-like light moved in circular paths, this time clockwise, with the same speed as before, and crossed the sky with blinding speed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Four years later, i was already in my second year of law school in ___________, I returned home for a semestral vacation. We left already our old house near the sea and transferred to another rented house about a hundred meters away from our first hourse. Around 9 PM, i decided to walk at the boulevard near the shore. I feel some kind of anticipation that my experiences before would be repeated, and i was constantly excited of the thought that, &#34;is it an alien spacecraft&#34;? So every semestral break, I would go to the same spot hoping for another sighting. For a time, I got frustrated. But on that particular sem break of 1993 (around late October), it happened again. I saw that bright object moving, no longer in the same spot but still near, and as in noticed it, it again sped off in circles counterclockwise like the first time, with the same blinding speed. I thought, my God, can it read my mind, because everytime i see it and think if its a UFO, it kind of &#34;reacts&#34; to my thought and moves suddenly as if it was jolted by my thought. I told these experiences to my family, but they just looked at me, perplexed. But since they knew me to be very objective and reasonable since i was a kid, they never actually disbelieved me. The same was true with my my friends. I was a student leader at that time (president of various school organizations and had been the editor-in-chief of our college paper), so they saw no reason for me to tell something untrue. Since then, I would wait on the same spot whenever i had the opportunity, but i was never that lucky again. Until now, whenever i would visit my parents in _______________, I always try if i could still see it. i just keep telling my kid and my wife that someday, people, especially our political leaders, might be reasonable enough to take a serious look at these events as part of the circumstantial evidence of the existence of perhaps another life-form that has a much more advanced civilization. i dont know the answers, but Im testifying based on facts and my perso! nal know ledge of certain events where one can draw up some preliminary assumptions.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.

10/17/93 18:00|Lihue|HI|Disk|aprox 60 to 90 mins|Hello Mr. Davenport,  I'm about to share something with you that happened quite a while ago but yet I have never reported this story wi|9/24/12|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/092/S92160.html|6|ndxe199310| Hello Mr. Davenport,  I&#39;m about to share something with you that happened quite a while ago but yet I have never reported this story with any official source.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am from the west side of the mountains, north of Seattle. I am a 52 year old male.  I attended Wenatchee Valley College and then attended Eastern Univ. in Cheney, WA.  My major was Audiology and that&#39;s my occupation currently.  It was 1992 when I started at Eastern and I put a year in when that horrible winter of 1992-1993 took place.  At that point I decided for a change due to the record breaking winter conditions, and since I always wanted to live in Hawaii after spending time there in the Navy, I sold my truck and RV and moved to Kauai.  I attended the two year school in Lihue working towards my degree and while there I befriended a gentleman who taught at the college.  As he learned of my living status he offered me to look after his aunt&#39;s house who was hospitalized with a stroke.  I ended up spending a year in Kauai and moved back to Spokane to finish up at Eastern.  But before I left the “Garden Island” the year I spent there was the most fascinating year of my lif! e.  And not solely because of what I&#39;m about to share with you, but also just from the people and the Hawaiian way.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was October 17, 1993, about 2 months after I arrived to Kauai, which my friend the math teacher and I were returning to his aunt&#39;s house where I was staying.  I still remember the time; it was about 6:00 pm and a beautiful Sunday evening.  We were sitting in the driveway chatting before I was getting ready to go inside the house.  As I was talking to my friend the math teacher, who was to my left in his driver&#39;s seat, I noticed in the corner of my eye something strange.  As I turned my head to the right looking outside my passenger window I saw a light ball traveling fast above me through the clouds.  It looked artificial maybe 6 feet in diameter traveling very straight and whizzed right over us at a good clip. It looked to be about 500 to 600 feet up coming at us at about 2 o&#39;clock. I only got a short glance at it this time, but I noticed it certainly was not a meteor because I could tell that it was artificial traveling at a rather at low altitude very straight.  There w! as no burning tail and it was close enough for me to get a very good look at it.  So then I turned to my math teacher friend and said “I just saw something very funny looking.”   So as we continued talking about, it then it appeared again about a minute later and having rolled my passenger window down this time I stuck my head out and saw it very clearly.  Again, it came at us at about 2 o&#39;clock but this time I saw it turn a 45 degree turn then another 45 degree turn and took off at 10 o&#39;clock right over the town of Lihue.  It was still daylight and even though it was simply a light ball traveling through the sky, it looked very very strange to see such a thing especially in broad daylight.  It made no noise and when it turned those 45 degree turns it didn&#39;t slow down at all and turned on a dime.  It looked like a big round lighted glass ball being remotely controlled at about 500 feet up.  Then we then got out of the car and my math teacher friend, who is a rather small sta! tured Japanese Hawaiian man, started joking and asking me if I! had bee n drinking.  He did not see this thing at all because he had a big bush along the driveway on his side of the car which blocked his view.  So at that point I went into the house and my math teacher friend took off for home.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I got into the house I realized what I just saw was not anything we have.  It had no wings, it was just a lighted glass ball traveling rather fast through the Hawaiian sky at about 500 feet up, and turned twice on a dime like something I’ve never seen before.  Again, when I saw it coming at us from 2 o&#39;clock it then turned 45 degrees from 3 o’clock and then straight to 9 o’clock then turned another 45 degree turn and took off at 10 o&#39;clock, and of course the times are a reference of direction.  So now I&#39;m in the house thinking wow! What do I do now?  S o I called the local am radio station in Lihue which was only about 5 blocks from the house.  A Hawaiian lady answered and I asked her if she had received any UFO reports.  She asked me if I was into “astrology” joking a bit, and I said no but that I just saw something very strange.  I asked her if I could come down to the radio station and if she could come outside to meet me so if both of us saw it together she could repo! rt it as a witness.  So I took off on my motorcycle and the lady came out with eyes as big as saucers herself.  We then stood together looking up at the sky and at that point I felt rather silly and we saw nothing.  So after saying thank you very much, I took my motorcycle and went back to the house.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At this time it had gotten dark and I parked my bike along-side the house on the lawn.  I got off the bike and looked up at the beautiful starry night Hawaiian sky and said these exact words, &#34;Well whatever it was I guess I&#39;m not seeing it again.&#34;   Then right at that point came the second strange part of this event, as soon as I said those words &amp;quot;Well whatever it was I guess I&#39;m not seeing it again&amp;quot;, I noticed to my right at about 3 o&#39;clock something moving very slowly coming right at my direction.  But this time it was something totally different from that of my first sighting, there was no light and it was coming towards me very slowly.  It was again an estimated 5 to 6 hundred feet up, about the same altitude as the first object I saw, and I could tell it was going to come right over my head.  Again, this time there was no light and I watched it get slowly closer and closer.  Then, it got right over my head as I was looking straight up at it and got a ve! ry good look.  When I focused in on it I got the strangest feeling inside of me that this thing wasn&#39;t “bad” but that it wasn&#39;t “good” either.  It never stopped moving but it was moving very slowly and when it got right over my head I could see the bottom of it from the Lihue city lights reflecting off of it.  It looked like a bottom of a frying pan with its re-entry burns on its bottom, a disk approximately 40 to 50 feet in diameter at about 500 feet up.  If you held a quarter over your head at arm’s length, that&#39;s about how big it looked to me from my vantage point.  And then this part was really weird, when it got right over my head I could see around it&#39;s perimeter an orange energy field, like an aura around its perimeter.  Then again, with no lights it slowly went right over Lihue into the mist and that was it.  I was agape and I couldn&#39;t believe what I just saw.  I was tempted to chase after it with my bike but I decided not to because I was kind of freaked out.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The next day I went to the Garden Island newspaper and after checking and asking all sorts of people I found no one who saw either the first lighted device or the later disk. Till this day I have found no one who saw it and I still wonder what it actually was, either an alien or military devices.  Kauai does have a known top secrete missile base but I myself believe it was a space craft.  My theory is the first light ball was a remotely controlled device that either was mapping the island or recording some other type of information, and the disk I saw afterwards was the mother craft.  But I guess I&#39;ll never know because I haven&#39;t seen either since.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So that&#39;s my personal UFO story and Mr. Davenport you&#39;re the first official UFO expert I have told this too.  It was a remarkable experience and it changed my thinking from UFOs being make believe stuff to something as real as we are.  Has it changed my life all that much?  Not really but I sure get strange reactions when I tell the story to folks.  If you would ever like for me to elaborate with the details a little more, and if anyone else you&#39;d like me to share this with I&#39;d be more than happy too.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thank you, ((name deleted))<n>

Shut down electrical system on pickup.<n> <n><n> <n><n> While driving east on a country road,one night in october &#39;93, we saw what we first thought was a bright star. Watching, we realized it was coming closer at a fast pace. The headlights went out on our truck and the motor died. We got out of the truck and stood beside it watching as the light stopped directly south of us in a field. After awhile, the light &#39;winked&#39; out. Windows, lit from within began rotating in a clockwise fashion. Some sort of huge object slowly &#39;swallowed&#39; the lighted object from west to east, very dark and silent. The lighted object appeared again, the one we first saw. It took off at about a 45degree angle to the west,southwest at an encrediably fast speed till it was too far to track, just disappeared into a pinpoint somewhere up among the stars. Then a second light came in ,same direction, from the east, and stopped right where the first one did. It did not &#39;wink&#39; out however, just sat there a few seconds, then shot off at that high rate of speed at about a 70 degree angle into the west, southwest sky as if in pursuit of the first one. Everything was absolutly silent the whole time. After all this was over, the lights worked on the truck again and it started right up. We have never known just how long we stood there watching.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

All we could really make out was that the bottom of the craft glowed predominately white but also had many colors spinning upward from the bottom of the craft to the edges.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In a matter of seconds two F-16s were seen in pursuit of this object.  Their afterburners were approximately twice as long as the planes themselves.  I know that they were F-16s as you could easily see the silhouette of their intake scoop directly underneath the cockpit against the ambient light emitted from Lake Charles and Westlake to the south.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The craft seemed to be leading them on a cat-and-mouse chase in that the planes would begin to catch up to the craft and then the craft would speed away in a different direction each time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This &#34;chase&#34; occurred over the Calcasieu river which is less than a mile south of where we had gathered that evening.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

We pulled over and had parked in a popular parking spot in a small town called stanley  which is placed right on the ohio river.  We had been parked maybe 5 minutes  and i was resting my head back on the headrest  watching the night sky over the ohio river looking in  the direction of north-west..of this I am positive.  I saw a glowing round light  that seemed to dim and bright in a repeating pattern. The color of this light was whiteish to light bluish in color.  I thought i t was a plane at first  but soon realized  by its movements  that it couldn&#39;t be.  Then i said to myself  it is a helicopter... but soon realized  that the distance it was covering  in what seemed like a millioneth of sec  that it wasnt.  I told my friend to look  and he saw it too.  I don&#39;t know how to describe it... but this object seemed to be reading my mind  moving in directions that i was telling it to go.  It took 10 minutes for me to KNOW  it wasn&#39;t anything manmade  it moved to quickly and efficiently... i had treetops on the opposite side of the river to base distance on  it was not quite as far away as the stars  but not as low as conventional aircraft fly, but way above the treetops. We watched for another 20  minutes or so, before i got scared and asked to be taken home, I also had him close the top on the convertible.   Once home in thruston southeast of where i first spotted the object, I looked in the sky and saw it again but more to the southeast of me  and over a rural area  not the river anymore...  it was still pretty far away...  I was spooked  told my friend bye and went in the house.   I went to a psychiatrist over this  who dismissed it and tried to put me on medicine for it... i found this funny....and maddening.   But 9 years later in late january of 2002 I saw the same object again. I was married at the second sighting it was like 4 am in the morning  and my husband was leaving for work.<n> <n><n> <n><n> we live in a small community less than a 1/4 of a mile away from the ohio river  and it seemed to be in the location  that i saw it in 9 yrs. previously.  I was very scared  locked the house down made sure all blinds were closed.  I don&#39;t know how describe the feeling of it being able to sense my thoughts.  I told a fieman friend of mine about it several hours later  and he said not to feel strange others have seen these things.  Incedentally i called the airport after the first sighting in 1993 the next morning  but they had no reports of anything strange.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

At least twice as big as a blimp even with it being about twice as high in the air. No lights. Seen just after sunset DIRECTLY OVER my house. It  moved slowly until it disappeared into the dark sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was almost dark when I saw it. If I had walked out just 15 minutes later, I would not have seen it. The object itself was totally black. No lights. I thought I might have seen four round circular objects on the underside as it passed over us but I can&#39;t be sure because it was so dark already.  It was huge and passed almost directly overhead. This was either three or four years ago.  I called my father to come outside and he did. My father and I are both business owners. My Dad didn&#39;t believe in UFO&#39;s before but he does now. I have always been interested in them.<n>

When I was in highschool we lived in thi shousing development in Portsmouth, NH. Our house had a view of the Pisctaqua river which seperates Maine from New Hampshire. This river was known in the 50&#39;s or 60&#39;s to have numerous UFO sighting spanning over a weeks time with many coming to view the lights. This particular incident that I had witnessed was zat night and it was dark. I was in the living room talking to my friend on the phone. As I was talking on the phone I was looking out the big picture window. I saw this light in the sky. It didn&#39;t look any different than a bright star. The thing that made it stand out was the fact it bobbing up and down and sometimes left to right. I watched it for about a minute and then it went straight up and out of my sight. I tried to take a picture of it but it came out dark probaly beacause I had taken it from through the window. I really belive that it was a UFO. I have always believed in UFO&#39;s having always been told as a child the story of Betty and Barney HIll (we lived down the street from them). Both times that I believe I have seen UFO&#39;s I was not looking for them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

It was approximately 3:30 pm in the afternoon on a beautifully clear fall day, I happened to notice what appeared to be a black object moving toward the north at a speed I would guess to be from the distance from where we were to be about 100 mph. It appeared to be about 500 feet above the ground. I quickly ran out the front door to get a better look, as my dad followed behind me. As we viewed the object from the street to get a better view, I shouted back to my wife to bring my binoculars out. When we arrive on the street, the object had almost slowed it&#39;s forward motion to a stop, and started a slow but steady upward motion to the south / southeast, but a more stright up motion than anything.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As we were viewing this object, another object came across moving in the same northerly direction, about the same speed, but this one did not slow down or change direction. The objects appeared to be black in color, and from what I could see, ( as the objects appeared to be about a mile to a mile and a half from where we were ), each looked to be like two very big &#34; black donuts &#34; overlaping each other with something attached inbetween. They made no noise. The had no lights. The color was more than black, it was like the absents matter. My father and I viewed this one object through my binoculars until it accended out of sight, as a small black dot thousands of feet toward the Gulf of Mexico which is about 50 miles from our hometown.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The rest of the story.....<n> <n><n> <n><n> I call the Regional airport in Lake Charles, (a larger town just east of Sulphur) and ask to speak to someone in the control tower. Well to make a long story short, I was told that you could not talk to them, and So I then asked the person who had taken my call if he could ask them if they had spotted anything unusual on their radar. He called back to inform me that &#34; even if they had, they could not tell me &#34;!!! But,they did give me a UFO hotline number to call. Well, I  called  and got a recording to leave information...which I did. I never received a return call on this.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I guess in all, the most disturbing thing about this to me was the fact that it seemed that my dad, wife and my mother and I were the only ones that saw this that afternoon. The people that I told about it acted like &#34; yea sure....&#34; ???  Since then, I have been very selective with who I share this story with. NUTS right ??  My dad nor myself use alcohol or smoke. My dad is in his seventys and I in my fiftys.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At the time I saw these, I guess one of my real concerns was that these could be some kind of remote controlled bombs floated in from the Gulf of Mexico, as we do live in an area with oil refineies and other plants. Of course, this took place before 911 in New York City and the government was not as alert as they are now.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Sincerely Sober, Lindal Herndon Sulphur, Louisiana<n>

I noticed a sphere hovering very near a statue referred to as the &#34;Lady of the Mountains&#34;. It was, what is commonly reguarded as, disk shaped with rounded dome and also rounded in a congruant fashion on the underside. Driving up the mountain I noticed that the craft was yellowish in color, gently changing it&#39;s hue to an orange and then back again. It remained stationary till I drove under and it disappeared due to my forward progress. Thinking it was one of those safety devices used to warn low fling aircraft of hi-tension wire in the area, I was not overly suspicious. As I was coming back using the same route on my return trip a few days later I would check it out as to placement of the devices. To my surprise on that return, day-trip this time, I encountered several grey vans with strange looking antennaes emmanating from them on the mountain overlooking Helena going south. What was even stranger were the personel. They were seemingly a bunch of &#34;goodlooking&#34; guys ages between 25 and 30 scurrying around in bluish-grey overalls. Going further south past Helena about 10 miles north of Butte, I again noticed similar vans with personel fitting the above description. Guess what? When I got to the place where I saw the object there were no high tension wires, nor were there any warning devices strung along any of the smaller cables crossing the hi-way at that point. Even stranger was the reoccurance of vans further to the south, before one reached the town of Dillon, Mont.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date of incident may be approximate, although the witness does not indicate that fact.

I was so scared and shocked that I couldnt speak to ge tthe person with me to turn around. It was just hovering over the trees.

I noticed a circular blue light traveling slowly over the tree line. The light glowed steadily, did not blink or flash, and was larger and brighter than a light on any aircraft I have seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The light moved in a straight line in a southern direction quite slowly then made an abrupt stop in mid air and hovered for a second.  The blue light glowed intensely brighter and then turned bright red and shot back north in the direction from which it had come.  There was just a red streak for half a second when it shot back, and then it disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have never seen anything move that fast, and I have never seen anything just disappear.  I would have thought something like that would have made a sound even through a window, but I heard nothing.  I told myself I must have imagined it, but I know what I saw.  I don&#39;t know what it was, but it was not similar to anything I have seen before or since.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

There was a huge sphere of shining light in front of our nine floor apartment block building, on the level of seventh or eighth floor. I observed it during approximately twenty minutes, to the best of my knowledge, and after that fell asleep. I was ten years old and decided that it was a contact with aliens. Nobody else has seen the sphere, although it&#39;s lightning ought to have been very noticeable. From that time on never did I experience the same.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Report was, in fact, submitted from Russia.  Witness provides illustration.  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

It was the highest moutain in our area and it has huge rocks all over it.   We have climbed the mountain before and it was very difficult due to thick forestsand rocks.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On that day we were coming home around 7.00 p.m. and on top of the mountain we saw a red light moving here and there.  So we stopped and watched it for a while.  I was with my parents and brother, and we called my grandparents and aunt also.  That light became yellow, green, blue and orange time to time. it went up into the sky so fast and came back.  This happend several times and we went inside after watching this for about 1/2 an hour.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The next day morning my brother was watching the mountain since it was school holidays, and he shouted aroung 9.00 a.m. in the morning.  We ran there and we saw 5 strange creatures moving on top of the mountain. We have seen people there earlier as tiny dots but these creatures were about 8-12 feet tall. Since we have been there earlier we compared them with the trees there.  We couldn&#39;t see their faces clearly but they were not human for sure.  They were much more taller than humans. After about 20-30 minutes they went around the mountain which is impossible for humans because that part of the mountain has only huge rocks.  According to our knowledge there was only one way to climb that mountain.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This mountain is visible to everyone because it was the biggest mountain in Gampola.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Other than this incident many friends of mine have told me that they have seen strange lights on top of this mountain.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Eventhough I was a small girl at that time I still can remember that incident very well. It always goes through my mind just like a film.  I always believed in extraterrostrial life and I will believe them till the end of my life.<n>

I confessed to having seen what I thought was a UFO, and thinking she would laugh at me.  However, she instead confessed her UFO experience that happened also many years ago in California. This got me thinking about it again, I brought it up with my mom to see if she remembered it and to see if it was really imagined.  My mom also remembers it vividly and also still wonders about it.  Reading other stories on this site, it doesn&#39;t sound so spectatular, but for me it was an amazing thing that makes me believe that I don&#39;t yet understand everything about our world and other worlds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So...what happened is that I was living with my family on a ranch near Pryor, MT, on the Crow Indian Reservation.  The Pryor Mountains are rumored to be a scared ((sic--sacred??)) place and the Crows have many stories of bizarre occurances there, including UFO sitings.  Still, didn&#39;t think we&#39;d ever see one.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Where we were living is very remote.  We did actually have one neighbor about a 1/2 mile away, other than that, there was no one for apx. 6 miles.  The house sat is a coulee between two ridges, with the Pryor mountains to the South of us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were driving down the hill toward the house with a clear view across the valley to the other ridge.  There, floating above the other ridge across from us was a very bright, large light, like a huge spotlight.  It just floated there for apx. 20-30 minutes.  We sat and watched it for awhile, then went down to the house, came back out and it was still there.  When we next checked on it, it was gone.  It was too large to be a car headlight, or a star, and too high off the ground for any other reasonable explanation.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Hoping someone could shed some light (no pun intended) as to what we saw.  Thanks.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD))<n>

We were watching it. It did not make any noise or anything at this time. It just looked like a star for the longest time. But it was moving so we know it was not a star. We talked about it and forgot about it. After about 45 minutes it began getting larger and larger. Then it was about 100 meters high and on the other side of a hotel that it at Spencer and University. It was very loud at this time. It was black. It has about 10 lights (It looked like what I would call navigational lights). It was triangular in shape overall. It looked like it was made of about 4 triangles. It had beams holding it together. Kind of like a jungle gym that made a big triangle. Each section was distinct. The lights were placed on the tips of each corner, and on the &#34;torso&#34; of the craft. At this time we thought that it was a strange type of plane going in for a landing. Then it occured to us &#34;Where the hell is it going to land? On the ASU campus?&#34;. Then it flew behind the hotel. The noise went away. Then about 15 minutes later, it emerged from the other side of the hotel. It proceeded in a declining angle of projectory and went behind a parking garage and we never saw it again. Once again as soon as we could not see it we could not hear it. It was loud enough that you could have heard it at least a mile away. It was LOUD. The lights on the craft were slightly blurry or hard to focus on. So I am checking the aura/haze button below.<n>
