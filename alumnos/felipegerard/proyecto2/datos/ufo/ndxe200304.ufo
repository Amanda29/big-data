As I came out of the tunnel into the city I turned around to see if it had crashed, and saw instead a large triangular craft with many lights on the bottom flying very slowly and low over homes. It was flying slow for a craft of its size. I couldn&#39;t stop to get a better look, since I was on the freeway. When I turned my head again I couldn&#39;t find it anymore from the night sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with this witness at considerable length, and she seemed quite serious-minded, and quite credible.  She described the incident quite lucidly and eloquently.  She reported that when she first sighted the triangular object, it was moving from her left to right (north), and then it suddenly dipped its nose down, and reversed the direction it was moving in less than one second (estimate).

Shortly followed by a loud rumbling. The ground shook and some trees bent down to the ground. Theyare still like that today. There was no wind at all during the 3 or 4 minutes I saw the 3 crafts. The lights that were flashing were bright white and rainbow colors. The other two people who were there were also astonished. We couldn&#39;t believe our eyes. There should seriously be some sincere investigation into this this was crazy. Also at the base of the three crafts they had large circular looking doors i can only asume that was what they were. Also all of the street lights turned out and there seemed to be no electricity in the area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We will attempt to corroborate some of the facts the witness, a high school student, represents above in her report.

4/30/03 20:50|Southern Pines|NC|Light|4 seconds|While driving home we saw several bright,very white lights that seemed to merge into one larger light and streak across the sky.|5/13/03|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/028/S28738.html|4|ndxe200304| While driving home we saw several bright,very white lights that seemed to merge into one larger light and streak across the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Our sighting was on Wednesday, April 30 at 8:50 PM EST. It took place about 6 miles north of Southern Pines, NC.  We saw several blotches of white light in an eliptical pattern in the sky to our left as we traveled North.  We were both startled.  As we moved forward about 30 yards, we lost the lights in the trees.  When we cleared the trees, and as my wife was preparing to turn left, I saw only one light in the same place.  It was a much larger light, about 20% as large as the moon.  It hovered for an instant and then took off across the sky as fast as a meteor.  There were clouds in the north and I assume it went behind those clouds.  I also assumed that the lights had merged when I caught sight of the light after clearing the trees although I did not see that take place.  The light covered about 15 degrees as it streaked across the sky before it disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We have corrected the time above to 20:50 hrs..  We spoke with the witnesses, and found them to be quite credible.  Their description of what they had seen was quite objective and unambiguous.  PD))<n>

It was too early in the evening to be a star but that&#39;s exactly what it looked like.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first I thought it was a reflection of an aircraft as it was a bright evening but it suddenly disapeared and a minute later reappeared in a slightly different location. There was sum cloud around but not in this area of the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was moving in a westerly direction and after five minutes of appearing and disappearing, it just disappeared altogether.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Noticed passenger jet in sky, had red and white paint  with white words. This caught my attention, as it seemed lower than usual. Stopped my car in middle of intersection when i saw sunlight glint moving underneath jet, about 100 ft underneath. &#34;reflection&#34; followed exactly with jet but was 1/5th the size. Best I can say it was either a &#34;steel pipe&#34; shape or tube. Absolutly stunning, it moved with jet perfectly timed but definetly an object,as it moved it stopped reflecting sun, and I saw it had white color then it faded away. Cars honking behind me made me move. Pulled into parking lot of diner and looked back, could see passenger jet but not object. I watched for about 30 seconds. Broad daylight, great visibility that day. I would not be suprised if someone on that flight saw something. I almost don&#39;t believe this was real, but I stared again and again in that time to try and make out more, but it was mostly a bright &#34;reflection&#34;, like shiny metal. However the object seemed white when the reflection of the sun died down. About the size of a automobile in relation to jet.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

At first I thought it was the international space station I could not see the craft but what I did see was lights in the shape of a V to a U, I watch object for upwards to 30 minutes  so I knew it was not an airplain, and when it started making a long 90 degree turn I knew that it was not the space station. At first the direction was from west to east, and after the 90 degree turn it was heading north. The altitude must have been at least sixty miles plus in order to be in my view for such a period of time. So it could have been a spy satellite but if it was it was a hugh one. And there was no noise what so ever.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Also have a sighting tht took place in essex, amboy california in 1994 this is a very interesting story filled with witnesses.

At first glance it looked like a star but it looked to be changing colours from a green/blue to red.(similar to a jetliner&#39;s lights) At this point I assumed it was a planet. Then I noticed that it was moving in a sporadic fashion (dipping and moving right and left) something I&#39;ve never seen. I thought I was hallucinating so I woke up my girlfriend who also observed it&#39;s bizarre movements in the sky. The speed it was moving was tremendous as it dipped and moved left to right. We watched it for about 40 minutes and then it started dimming until it was gone. Oddly enough this is the 2nd time in 3 months that I&#39;ve seen the exact same thing. The first time I thought my eyes were playing tricks on me so the 2nd time I awoke my girlfriend so that I knew I wasn&#39;t going crazy.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

4/28/03 23:00|Cheboygan|MI|Unknown|5 minutes|we were looking for satellites when we saw three objects flying in a triangular formation in space|6/3/03|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/029/S29005.html|11|ndxe200304| we were looking for satellites when we saw three objects flying in a triangular formation in space<n> <n><n> <n><n> My fishing buddy and I are both 38 years old, and of sound mind. I am a successful, professional meteorite hunter as a part time occupation, carpet installer the other part.My friend is a lifetime carpenter in high demand, because his fine work and integrity.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Neither one of us has ever seen a UFO before, we arn&#39;t UFO nuts or anything like that, in fact we have always been very skeptical of all that &#39;nonsense&#39;.<n> <n><n> <n><n> While up in northern Michigan, doing some trout fishing, we had a strange occurance that we can&#39;t figure out. We were sitting around a small campfire looking up at the stars, looking for satellites when we spotted three lights in a triangle pattern that looked as high as the stars. They were not colored, nor were they blinking, they looked like stars. At first the movement across the sky was barely perceptible, you had to watch them close, then it was apparent they were indeed moving, from west or southwest to east or north east, not exact on that, I would have to go back with a compass to know for sure. We were thinking you know, that satellites don&#39;t fly in formation do they? They seemed to be going too slow, it took a full 5 minutes for them to traverse the piece of sky we were looking at, which was limited due to surrounding trees. If you held your hand out at arms length and measured the distance between the three objects with your fingers, it was  about an inch between each of the three lights making a triangle. That would translate into a great distance relatively speaking. There were definately 3, I could see between them as they passed stars.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Just before they got to the trees and left our sight, a real satellite shot from the north and crossed their path and proved beyond a doubt that the three objects were way out in space, because the satelite was between us and them, and infact was rediculously close to us in comparison to the  UFO&#39;s. The satellite whizzed past, and the UFO&#39;s were still there, just cruising, until they were gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> That&#39;s my story, strange but true.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We believe that the U. S. Navy &#34;NOSS&#34; satellites, which appear in a triplet,  would be the first possibility that would have to be ruled out.  PD))<n>

What looked to be a three stars in a triangular formation was moving across the sky at about the same pace as a satelite. They were very spread out...probably miles apart, but were moving the exact same speed. The space in between them was clear and we could see stars through it, so I know that there were three individual craft, not one craft with three lights. Also, we could tell that they were out of the earth&#39;s atmosphere because the sun was reflecting off of them, like it does on satelites. It seemed that they weren&#39;t shining their own lightsource. My brother and I had never seen anything like this before. We spotted them when they were about half way across the sky, and they were off of the horizon in about a minute. Pretty wild.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We suspect the witnesses may have observed the &#34;triplet&#34; of NOSS satellites, thought to be launched periodically by the U. S. Navy.  PD))<n>

I waited for the cloud to pass or the lights to move away from the cloud to better see, but this stayed for over an hour. These 3 lights did change size and intensity of brightness several times and there appeared to be a small laser beam of blue light emanating from the cloud to the ground,fixed on a spot somewhere in Toluca Lake below. It appeared a very large craft. Around it simultaneously were smaller &#34;circles of light&#34; craft, approximately 6 or so, which lit up behind clouds and were in constant motion, darting in all directions simultaneously. Some of them would shine lights out in various directions as if looking for something. All of this was completely silent, too. No noise was discernable except for the 3 or 4 helicopters which began buzzing around all of this after about 15 minutes. This continued for over an hour when the 3 lights became 2 and they slowly faded until all that remained was the blue light fixed in the same spot. Also, all of the strange clouds completely vanished as well, leaving a dark, moonless night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Please see other reports for the same date from California.  PD))<n>

I&#39;ve never seen lights there before.  As I turned right on Lost Hills, I kept looking and the lights didn&#39;t move and so I decided it wasn&#39;t a plane.  If it was a plane, I was not sure how they could have these two large white lights and not move.  The sky was very dark and since I was a few miles away, I couldn&#39;t see the shape too well.

I&#39;m not sure how many witnesses there were since we had to keep driving after we saw it. Many people who were able to pull over did pull over to watch it. The UFO was VERY CLOSE to the ground, it was perhaps 60-70 ft over the freeway. It hovered in one spot and rotated it self in circles and on its side. The UFO was circular and the bottom had lights in a design that looked almost like a flower of some sort. It was spinning. The bottom was spinning one way and the top part was spinning the other. The UFO was of a grayish color with yellow lights. Only one was seen. After we had passed the UFO, I quickly turned around to continue watching it. It hovered for about another 10 seconds, and then it started to light up and emit a bright light, and then all of a sudden, I saw a blue streak of light and it was gone. The speed at which it traveled was beyond imagination. There seemed to be no noise coming from the UFO, as thought it was just floating there and there was no engine that was helping it fly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We are unsure as to whether the sighting occurred in the morning, or the evening.

(See Photo)<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were up all night skygazing. At exactly 6:06 AM we observed a hovering craft directly to the south, approximately 4-5 miles from our backyard. We thought it was a helicopter, as it displayed numerous red, green, white, and blue lights and was seemingly just hovering.  Suddenly the object ascended rapidly and radically, then moved very rapidly to the west then to the east, probably about 100 yards each direction.  It then departed toward the east at a very high rate of speed.  I was able to capture the object on a Polaroid 640 Digital camera.  We do not know if others witnessed this sighting, but we would sure like to know.  When I downloaded the images onto my computer, I was surprised to find the object was there more than once.  It was very exciting, and the sightings continue to this day  (June 01, 2003), only it is always different craft, sometimes multiple objects, and almost always, these craft seem to be aware of our presence.  Three of us have become regular nightly stargazers, using two telescopes, two digital cameras, binoculars, and one video camera, which we have recorded some very amazing video.  I was an officer in the Air Force over 20 years ago, and I know we have improved our technology a great deal, but nothing like this. We are as confused as we are amazed at what has been occuring just 25 miles south of Albuquerque, and yet, there is no news of these events or sightings, which is very confusing?

Having a convertable I tend to see more stuff going on then the regular vehicle.  I looked up as I was coming down the hill and saw the strangest Orange Light in the sky.  As I came to the stop light I looked almost striaght up at it.  It was directly above my car probably the same height as commercial airliners.  I noticed it was moving slightly in a circle and kept pulsating an Orange Glow.  I kept looking at it but it didn&#39;t move like any kind of air craft, it almost hovered.  I called up my buddy down the street he live on Ingraham St.  He jumped outside and was tripping on what he was seeing as well.  He continued to watch it and said it just eventually faded out after about 10 minutes of viewing it.  It was an amazing and unexplainable sighting.  If anyone in the San Diego area saw this tell us about it.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

We were in the cave for about 1.5-2 hrs when we heard some sounds coming from one of the caverns. The sound was like that of a pick against the rocks about every 20-30 sec. We went to investigate thinking it might be other cavers, or unlicenced miners. We had to climb down a shaft that was about 30&#39; in diameter and on a 60% slope for about 200m. As we came closer the noise had stopped. We went on closer to where we thought it was coming from and at that moment we saw a craft or object fly by us at a high rate of speed. (25-30 KM/hr). It had to be hovering because the ground was to rough and steep for anything to be moving along the ground. No light or sound came from it and we also noticed when it passed us that it didn&#39;t even create any wind. Our lights are bright for caving and it didn&#39;t reflect the light as any kind of object I have seen before. It was sort of diamond shaped but also resembled a tear drop too with the front as more pointy. It came within 3-4&#39; of me as it passed without a sound or wind. It was about 12-14&#39; across at widest point and aprox 25-30&#39; long and it looked solid with no windows or visible openings.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We will forward the case to Canadian investigators for a follow-up investigation, or interview.

I pointed them out to my girlfriend, who was also in the driveway and then we observed them for several minutes. They moved into several different formations. One of the young people from the neighborhood was walking by while speaking with his girlfriend on a cell phone. The girlfriend was 5 miles north of our location. We pointed the objects out to him, and he described them to his girlfriend, who looked from her window and also saw them. The objects faded away gradually after a while and then 3 of them reappeared about 5 degrees west of the spot from which they had disappeared. The 3 objects affected several changing formations over a period of several minutes, faded away, and to our knowledge, have not re-appeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

There is a security light in the park that has a bluish/white light on a telephone pole and almost directly over the security light was an orange ball.  The orange ball was just slightly larger than the security light but much further away.  It appeared to be over the middle of the bay.  I watched it for about five minutes during which time it did not move.  It was much larger than a planet or star but not nearly as large as a full moon would have appeared that close to the horizon.  It did not appear to be a flare as it was stationary in the sky and it did not appear to be burning.  I went inside for less than 1 minute to get my wife (who did not come out to see it) and when I returned it was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

We were in Banos, Ecuador for two nights. On the second night, my room mate (a management consultant) was on the balcony of our hotel whilst I was filling in my journal. It was night time. She banged on the window and called me out, as she couldn&#39;t believe what she could see. I went out and was amazed. There were two small balls in the sky. They were reddish/yellow - they kind of looked like balls of lava or something. They could grow and alter their brightness, but remained a sort of red colour all the time. One of them was to the left of me - it seemed to be heading towards the constellation of Orion. The second one was zipping around the sky, sometimes fast, sometimes slow, but I have never seen anything move like it before. She said that one of the balls actually came down into the valley and then went back up into the sky (but did not actually land).<n> <n><n> <n><n> There is a mountain across the valley, and from behind it was a flash like sheet lightening. Then another ball rose slowly upwards. It did the same as the second ball, following the exact manouvoures that I watched the second one do. By now, the second ball had moved to the left slightly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A few minutes later, a fourth ball rose, again, preceded by a flash from the mountain. This did the same as the two balls behind it. The third ball had also moved over to the left. The three glowing balls made a triangle and stayed still in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At this point I was pretty freaked out so I ran back into my room and across the hall to get some more of our tour group. Two of them came back with me (one works in a laboratory, and the other is a psychologist), and the four of us watched the lights. By now, the first light could not be seen, and balls 2 and 3 were heading over towards Orion. Ball 4 waited in the sky. There was another flash from behind the mountain and then a fifth ball rose upwards. It was bigger than the other ones, and instead of doing any manouvours, it went straight across the valley and appeared to go behind the mountain behind our hotel. The fourth ball then went off into the sky, and could be seen very faintly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I watched the whole thing for half an hour. We then had to go off for a group meal at a local restaurant. When we came out, the sky had clouded over so I could not see if they were there or not.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I didn&#39;t take a photo as there was a streetlight below us and it would have flooded the picture with light. I wish I had a camcorder though!!  Even now I don&#39;t know what it is we saw. There is no way it could have been a hot air balloon or aeroplanes, nor helicopters. They made no sound at all.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

At first I though it was a plane until it rotated and it did not have wings that I could see.  Having observed planes flying into the Atlanta airport all afternoon, this object stood out because of the altitude it was flying at, and its size, which was smaller than a plane would have been.  After observing this for approximately thrity seconds, it changed direction and went west, and that was the last I saw of it.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I watched it for a few minutes, then went into the house to get my binoculars.  With the binoculars I could clearly see the shape, it resembled a white to bright silver barbell or capital I. I watched for few more munutes, it apeared to be moving slowly to the east as I heard the sound of  military fighter getting louder then it vanished. I observed the jet, it was larger than a fighter, and it looked as if it going to the spot where the object was. The object was fairly large, because it was a fair distance away. I obseved this object for 8-10 minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I looked up, and just above the roof of the strip mall, a couple miles up in the sky, I seen this disc shaped thing hovering.  I kept walking along the back of the strip mall staring at it and it started to move in the same direction I was going.  It fallowed my direction for a couple seconds then it took off very fast away from me. When it was flying, it didn&#39;t make a sound.  I watched it untill it looked like a little ball flying in the distance. When it got that far away it swerved off to the left and flew that way for a couple seconds then disapeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

In the sky, just at the top of the cliffs we saw a bright light that looked like the moon. The object was very low, very large, and very bright. Just as if it were the moon sitting there.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After viewing the object for only about 10 to 15 seconds, the object quickly dropped down behind the cliff, then quickly back up, then dropped down again. At this point the object appeared to explode into a big burst of pink, blue and white light with bright flashes of light traveling across the top of the cliff until it faded out.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object was very visable, not far away.

It was still twilight at the time.  When it reached a certain portion of the sky in the east, the lights moved into a straight line.  My friend and ran inside to grab our husbands, and over the next 45 minutes we watched 11 more objects with different numbered lights (3- 25), move overhead west to east.  All started in different locations (we didn&#39;t see where, they just appeared out of what seemed nowhere).  But the &#34;tail&#34; lights would start moving back and forth at a certain point of the sky.  I have never seen a UFO before in my life, and neither had anyone else there.  Two of them are lawyers and hardcore skeptics.  But after the sixth craft, there were convinced that it wasn&#39;t any sort of military craft (due to the fact it made no sound and the lights didn&#39;t blink at all). That Sunday I saw one more, but that was it.  It was truly amazing.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was moving about as fast as a falling star and made no sound even though it seemed to be as large or larger than a 747 airplane.  Then twenty minutes later we saw what we thought was the same object, but this time there were four lights.  The fourth light was located in the middle of the two rear lights and this fourth light moved out past the rear light on the left side of the object and then back to the middle of the two rear lights.  The second object seemed to be going a little slower than the first one as we were able to view it a little longer.  The lights were shaped like a globe and where not real bright as they did not light up the ground below. Both objects seen where moving in the same general direction from east to west. The sky was clear that night as we were looking up at the stars when we spotted the objects.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

To be brief about this as possible, I could not tell if the object had any shape but it had 2 red lights ( one of which faded on and off)1 green light and 1 white light. Now I was about to dismiss this as a plane except for 2 odd factors. I stared at the object through my 12x50 binocs, noticing it was going up and down while traveling. I thought it was just me shaking the binos till I saw it better with my eyes and noticed it was infact going up and down :-). Now I thought this would be weird for any object I&#39;ve ever seen. The other factor was the NO SOUND that came from it. A brief second after I spotted it, I looked up and saw a jet flying HIGH up, over 30,000 that made a loud noise but this object I was staring at..made NO SOUND. So I thought it was odd, So I just followed it for a while till it almost dissappeared over a concrete wall but then it stopped for a moment, so I continued to stare at it, then it stareted to hover up a bit and travel some more ( What was odd about it..was it stopped when it was almost out of my view twice, as if it didn&#39;t want me to not miss it!) It eventually dissappeared over the horizon after making a few zig zag patterns and stopping a few more times.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
4/24/03 21:55|Houston/Quick/Telkwa (Canada)|BC|Sphere|different periods|HBCCUFO CANADIAN REPORT:  Northern British Columbia Glowing Sphere In 3 Communities witnessed by 5 people.|5/9/03|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/028/S28666.html|50|ndxe200304| Northern British Columbia Glowing Sphere In 3 Communities witnessed by 5 people.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Houston, Quick &amp; Telkwa  Date: April 24, 2003 Time: (starting at 10:55 p.m.) Local &amp; Toll Free UFO Hotline Witnesses - 5  A little background on a sighting from July 29, 2002 first. The reason I brought up this shortened report again is, why so many sightings being seen around these areas. Military or government testing?, or a natural phenomena, or something else ! (Unknown). And there is certainly something taking place around here.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Last year over the Houston, Quick and Telkwa skies we had a rather large sighting which still has me baffled. As I and the Smithers Interior newspaper reported on the sighting after it happened, I soon found out that the story was growing by the day. The week after the sighting on July 29, 2002 if seems &#34;dozens, upon dozens&#34; of northern resident here in Houston, Telkwa and Smithers were witnessing military vehicles which were traveling highway #16 and on the back roads throughout the areas. Also I found it more than strange to find out a large amount of fixed winged aircraft and helicopters were flying so very low all around these communities, and keeping their flights at a very low level. Even I witnessed large transport aircraft flying back and forth from the north to the south.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After a night out for dinner at a close friends home, I arrived home to find two messages on my answer machine informing me that there was a great deal of aircraft activity taking place some 80 kilometers out the Morice River Road. (in the middle of no where). I was to meet up with one of the fellows who contacted me. So at 3:00 a.m. I took a trip in his logging truck so he could show me what he was talking about. Sure enough, just after 4:00 a.m. and still dark out, unknown lights were seen flying freely and low across the sky. In the opposite direction an aircraft was flying towards a light. After the two passed each other the &#34;aircraft&#34; made it&#39;s turn to follow the strange light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A full week, and longer, two different logging contracting crews who were working in two separate areas. (or cut blocks) had observed numerous aircraft flying low up the Morice Valley, and low over the mountain peaks. (just so you know this would be dangerous to say the least due to the rugged terrain, but there they were looking for something, so witnesses said. Or at least in their opinion, that&#39;s what they all thought was going on.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Reports on the above sighting can be found at my website under British Columbia Sighting Reports.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Houston, B.C. (just west of)   Now on April 24, 2003, starting at 10:55 p.m. two witnesses here in Houston, B.C. caught sight of a really interesting and strange light/object. At approx: 2 kilometers west of the town of Houston, just past the railway and highway #16 bridges these two folks saw in front of them a small glowing sphere shaped object almost sitting on highway #16 at the top of the hill they were about to head up. (HBCC UFO Note): To give you an better of where the witnesses were sitting when they spotted it. After traveling through Houston heading west, it is pretty flat ground with the Bulkley River winding along side the highway. At about 2 kms you would come to a blue bridge which crosses the Bulkley River, as one leaves the other end of the bridge you then start climbing a short, but steep hill heading in the direction of Quick, Telkwa and Smithers, B.C. The witness had just crossed the bridge when they caught sight of this light.)  As they headed up the hill, or approx; half ways up, the light disappeared from their line of sight. Once they arrived at the crest of the hill, again they noted the light moving north (away from them), and flying almost straight, following highway 16 at a low altitude. They told me that it was not much more than 80 to 100 feet off the road. The witnesses were at the time traveling at a speed of approx: 80 to 90 k&#39;s per hour and the object was slowly pulling a head of them. They lost sight of it once again just before the Irrigation Lake turn off. (or close). The only reason the object disappeared from their vision was due to the tree line. (Plus curves and hills in their view). It was the last time they saw the object. The total time that they observed the event was approx: 20 to 30 seconds. The description that was given of the object, was that it appeared to be completely round, glowing, or for maybe a better word - pulsating. It was about the size of a small digital satellite dish from the distance they had to view it. The object made no sudden movements, such as to the right or left, it stayed on a straight flight path. They also said because of the distance they were from the light, they said there was no sound heard coming from it. Also at one point the object seemed to light up the center roadway markings. (solid white reflective center lines).<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thank you to the Houston residents for their welcomed report.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Quick, B.C. (Woodmere Road just off Highway #16)  Date: April 24, 2003 Time: approx: 11:20 p.m.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On April 24, 2003 a farmer and his son out tending their cattle on a dairy farm at Quick, British Columbia. Both also witnessed the same object, or it seems to be. The son was hauling out manure from the barn with their tractor when he gave out a yell for his Dad to come out and look. When the Dad came out his son was pointing toward the western edge of their farm, and sitting at a dead stop just over top a group of evergreen and poplar trees, was a bright ball of white/yellowish light. They said no sound could be heard from it. HBCC UFO asked for an approx: size to this object. The reply was that is may have been close to the size of a full pick-up truck. Or as close as the witnesses could estimate. The object/light was closer to the Quick residents than the people driving just outside of Houston, B.C. which would have given them a closer view of the object, and this is why it looked larger. (in my estimation)  The sighting lasted for approx: 10 to 15 seconds, before it started moving north towards the Telkwa/Smithers area. Both of these Quick residents lost sight of the light/object after it rose up slightly to get over a small hill in the distance. They said what ever it was seemed to take it&#39;s time and flew in a straight line to the west, but at a very low level before having to gain a little in altitude to make it over top a hill. ( I asked if any of the farm animals reacted to this event, both said no).<n> <n><n> <n><n> Telkwa, B.C. (Object observed over Tyhee Lake)  Date: April 24, 2003 Time: approx: 11:45 p.m.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A fellow who resides in the Telkwa area was on his way home, he left highway #16 and drove along the Telkwa High Road. Just has he was adjacent with Tyhee Lake Provincial Park he observed a ball of light flying &#34;erratically&#34; low over the lake. The witness said the light/object was moving quite quickly and reminded him if it was out of control when it first caught his attention. He stopped his vehicle to watch, and wondered what he was looking at. It was low enough that it did cast it&#39;s light onto the lake below it. The man said he heard no sound, but I was told he did remain in his vehicle as the &#34;thing&#34; flew up the lake, moving from side to side, up and down, until it reached almost half way up the lake, then it veered off to the northeast towards the Babine Lake Provincial Park (or towards  Granisle area) at a high rate of speed. (and clearing the mountain on the other side of the lake). He said is was so weird and all happened so fast, approx: 10 to 15 seconds at his guess. His estimation of the size of it was close to the size of a small car. The object was bright, and a off white in color.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The witness said if it wasn&#39;t for his wife telling him to call me, he would not have known who to contact, or if he would as it was so strange and he thought, who would believe me anyway ??  HBCC UFO Note: When I did my weekly radio UFO update show this past Thursday I asked area residents to call or write if anyone else had seen this event. Also I keep getting asked, why are there so many reports of unknown sightings coming from the pacific northwest here in British Columbia. Of course my reply is, I really do not know !!! I know with all the media attention I do get here, UFOs are a topic of discussion in the Saw Mill lunch rooms, area businesses and private homes. So when something is seen flying through the skies in northwest British Columbia, there is a good chance I will receive a call or email. But I do know, just in Houston, B.C. where I live, there have been a great number of UFO sightings gone unreported as I hear about one darn near once a week through a second hand party. I do not report on any of these as I have not talked with the witnesses who actually seen the unusual sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> One more item I should also mention while I am here. I reported to you folks, and so did the media a while back on a major sighting which took place at Terrace, British Columbia, over Lake Elselake. Triangles had been seen flying low over, or around the lake. Finally I had a bit of a break through on this case and hope to have a full report on this soon. To be honest, I thought this may have been a hoax, but it is looking as if something really did take place over that area. What, well that is another question.<n> <n><n> <n><n> PS - If any more information on the above Houston/Quick/Telkwa sightings come in, I will certainly post all new information on this case. Plus I will be adding maps and photos to this case when I upload the reports to my website.<n> <n><n> <n><n> (There are no photos of the object in question, but rather area photos of the places the object was seen).<n> <n><n> <n><n> Take good care Director Brian Vike email: hbccufo@telus.net Canadian Toll Free UFO Hotline - 1 866 262 1989 HBCC UFO Research New Site - http://www3.telus.net/public/wilbur8/hbcc_ufo_research.htm Main Site (Moving) http://www.geocities.com/hbccufo/home.html<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Our gratitude to Brian Vike, Director of HBCC UFO, for sharing these reports with NUFORC.

We believe it was 7 lights in total (3 on each side and one in the lead).  It flew silently above us at about 4000 feet (estimated one witness who is a former F-18 pilot) doing a rather high speed heading north.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I would like to know if anyone else in Guelph or anywhere else saw the same thing tonight.

They were in a horizontal line, maybe 20 feet spacing between each one. (estimates are difficult, hard to tell how far away they were).<n> <n><n> <n><n> It appeared as though the right-most light split into two, and the new light floated off farther to the right, and the left-most light faded out.  So, in this leap-frog fashion, there seemed to always be 4 lights in the sky.  They &#34;leapfrogged&#34; 3 or 4 times while I was watching.  Then they faded away.  This all happened in less than 10 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This was in the southwest corner of Plover, Wisconsin, appearing to be near Highway 54.  It was a mostly clear, warm spring evening.<n>

As Max ran over to &#34;go&#34; I put my hands in my sweatpants pocket and looked up at the sky. It had rained hard last night so I was admiring how nice it was with light clouds spotting the sky and how pretty the stars were. There wasn&#39;t a breeze or any noice other than the dogs collar from walking around.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It smelled very fresh out.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I noticed out of the corner of my eye what I thought was a bird flying overhead. I looked directly at the object and thought that&#39;s not a bird...&#34;How the heck is that guy hang-gliding around here?&#34; I thought it was a hangglider because of it&#39;s altitude, shape, and lack of noise.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then I said,&#34; Oh my God, what the heck is that?&#34;  I watched the object, perfectly focused for about 6 seconds before it flew into some sparse clouds. I was dumbfounded.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I followed the path of the object hoping it would hold it&#39;s course and come out the other end. It didn&#39;t...I thought I saw it circle tightly and turn towards the East.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When then all heck broke loose. 4 planes came out of no where and converged on some mountains East of my house; where the object headed. Not sure what kind of planes they were. Then what I thought were two jets (F-16?) off in the north headed over towrds my direction in a sort of glide speed. They made very little noise, but I could still hear the jets.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I ran in to tell my wife what had just happened. Grabbed the binoculars and ran back outside, she came outside for a second to look, but went back in because it was cold for her.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I watched the sky intensly for awhile (1 to 2 minutes) and watched for the craft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> , ran into the garage, grabbed the ladder and climbed onto the roof. There were alot of aircraft over new the mountain range.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Two passenger jets went over head slightly west of me (their flight for SFO) Another jet (F-16?) came into view, southwest of where the object first glided over head. He headed into the clouds the object went into which had now blowed over the mountain range and disappeared. I then head a helicopter over in the area...it held it&#39;s course thorugh the clouds heading North toward the Oakland airport.<n> <n><n> <n><n> All of this was amazing!!! i still cannot believe it, but I swear I saw this object and I have NEVER seen anything like it in all of the military programs I have seen on cable stations.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had one beer while I bar-b-q&#39;ed salmon and finished the same one with dinner. I do not use drugs!  I called Coast to Coast a.m. and got on the air with George and told most of my story....up until I got onto the roof. This is amazing...I plan on looking for it later this evening and tomorrow night.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was still dark, I was looking up at the sky when in the distance I this giant blue fireball.  At first thought to myself, it&#39;s a comet.  Then I told myself, no it&#39;s blue. It looked like a great big gas flame, only it was really big. It came from the West and was headed East.  As it went infront of me, the dogs ran inside and I ran further out in the yard and lost sight of it thru the trees.  I really couldn&#39;t tell just how close it was.  It looked like it behind the Pine Trees at the back of my yard, yet just above the house behind me, like tree top high.  As I watched it go out of sight, I stood there listening for a crash or something.  What was it?  It made no sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous.

We looked to the sky to look at the stars, when we saw this red object moving across the sky from west to east. We immediately looked at each other and said &#34;what the hell was that?!?&#34; Momentarily, we came to the conclusion that it must have been a shooting star, because there was no other explination. Before we could say anything else, the object made a 170 degree turn back towards the west. We were freaking out at this point  thinking what the hell... and it disappeared. Two seconds later we looked up again, and there was a huge bright white light with a haze around it in front of us. I ran back into the hotel room cause i didn&#39;t know what to do. Definately was the most unexplainable sight i&#39;ve ever seen in my entire life.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I expected to see a flash or perhaps feel a jolt from the event but neither occured. It was simply there and gone. The color was quite remarkable and unlike anything I have ever witnessed in the night sky due to a natural event (shooting star etc. etc.).<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I am also a skeptic on UFO’s. I’m the have to see it to believe it type of person. On April 23rd, 2003 around the time of 11:00p.m. to 12:00a.m. I was looking at the stars like I always do before I go to bed. As I looked out the window I saw an airplane coming from the east as I watch the plane I noticed in the north-northeast what looked to be a star like object in-between the tree moving kind of slow towards the east. I thought it must have been a satellite, as it kept moving it grew in brightness, it got as bright as Venus or Jupiter. As I watched the object my mom had let the dogs outside so I quickly ran out the door to go watch the satellite like object movie across the sky, as I got outside I didn’t seen it, it vanished. I looked around the sky but saw nothing. So I came back inside and looked out the window towards the north-northeast again and a few seconds later I saw the star-like object in-between the trees again (in the same place as before) it was moving towards the east again. As I watched the object it grew in brightness, as it kept moving it started to fade out I called my mom over to watch but she just missed it. It faded in the east. I kept watching for 5 minutes but I didn’t see anything. My mom said I must have seen a satellite, but I have never seen a satellite vanish and the go back to the same spot.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Over the past year, I have seen frequent lights in the sky (burnt orange in color) which look like flares, but do not behave as such.  My son and I were coming home from town when we noticed another of the burnt orange lights/fireballs in the sky.  We turned off the main road and sat with our car facing it.  It came toward our car before it stopped (about 1/2 mile away).  It then got very bright and separated into 3 fireballs (all looked like flares - all hovered).  One of the lights began to slowly descend toward the ground, one began to slowly go higher into the air, and one of the fireballs stayed in the same spot.  I decided to go toward it so we could get a closer look.  As I headed down the road, the light that was higher than the other two shot up into the sky and disappeared, the one that was hovering and not moving quickly blinked out, and the other one descending rapidly descended to the ground and disappeared.  My son got scared, so we stopped and looked a little longer.  We saw no evidence of anything, so we went home.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  The witness has offered to forward a VHS copy of his tape.  We will review it, and comment here, if we believe the footage may be UFO-related.  PD))<n>

Went out to curb to investigate. Noticed that my half of the street was totally full of water, water running in the curb. Turned around to start to come back in, and  looked up into the sky as I usually do.  There was a beautiful, pure red round light just south of straight up, which was motionless and silent.  After one minute in awe, I ran in to get my camera.  Upon return it was still there.  I videoed for approximately three minutes, with the brightest star in the picture, before it started to move eastward.  As it gained speed it was flashing and glowing with more brilliance and speed.  Just before it left my view it paused and turned towards the south.  It continued to flash and glow a bright red.  Then out of sight. When viewed video, noticed a hot pink starlike light.  Also, when panned down accidentally, can see water in street for two seconds.  Video to follow.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Something flying low in one straigt path not very far away, shape  was like a bus/cigar or a corn, 10-15 feet long, lighted up straight to me like a ferry with lights on in night , no sound, very low passing, not like a satelite i know how they look like. Very bright light actually and i was seeing it from the side, it came from north to south.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I told my neighbour to look at it, and i said &#34;that has to be a UFO&#34; but he had to climb up on his fence to manage to see it cause he was standing on the ground, i was up on my porch. While he was climbing up on his fence the object started to fade out.<n> <n><n> <n><n> He didnt reach seeing it before it faded out, had probs getting up on his fence to see over his outhouse. I have a feeling that it was aiming at me with the lights cause my neighbour was looking at that direction it came.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Appearently it was  over him when it lighted up, like it was only ment for me to see it. This is not a story i made up, it actually happened, i have seen many strange things on the sky since, but in higher altitudes, like blinking fast moving &#34;satelites&#34;, never seen that b4 lol, even my brother saw that one with me on my porch.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I will never forget this, cause it was the day b4 my daughter where born.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I tell u we are not alone, that would be pretty naive! I asked myself this question at once: What appear so close but do not have any sound and suddenly throw a huge wide amount of lights from its side against me and fades black again while passing in aprox.100 mph?????? Not a plane, im very sure. My neighbour said: &#34;weird&#34; sad i didnt reach to see it all lighted up&#34;<n>

I have lived in this house for two months. The view is spectacular, and numerous times daily I take in this view. Last night I glanced up while making bottles for my 7 month old, and there were two bright lights above the forest hills. One of the lights was much smaller than the other one. So, I walked from the kitchen and went out on our deck. Indeed something was odd! So, I went to wake up my husband who was sleeping on the couch. By the time I got back the small light had vanished.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I got a much better look at the bigger light. Let me state that in all of my hill gazing in the past there are a couple houses on the upper portion of the forest, and a small pin-size light. There is (and never has been) a light like this. The light was so bright! It was a bright white light that sometimes looked red. It had huge blue green rays that came off the craft that were very defined. The light was a diamond shape, and brighter than any light (minus the sun) that I&#39;ve ever seen. My husband would not wake up! I finally got him up and he went out and looked and said &#34;yeah, I&#39;m going to bed&#34;. He was half asleep, and even though I pleaded that &#34;you know there are no lights there&#34; his overtime ridden body had taken the helm.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I couldn&#39;t find our digital camera, so I woke my husband up 10 minutes later, and he said it was out in the car, but I couldn&#39;t find it. He must have left it at work. I even have a 10X zoom, so I might have been able to get a good shot. This is the part that frustrates me the most! I was amazed that I had time to call my Mom on the east coast (twice to wake her up) and talk on the phone for about 10 minutes, wake my husband up twice, look for the camera in the car and upstairs and downstairs before the light went away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My Mom and Grandma had a UFO experience when my Mom was about 4 years old in Florida.  I had only heard the story once, but they were both so adamant that it had happened that I knew my Mom would believe me! Ironically, my Grandfather had been sleeping at the time and wouldn&#39;t wake up. If only my baby were older and could share this with me (like my Mom had)!  I had expected the light to zip away as others had described, but it didn&#39;t. It turned off like a light switch. I was looking at the craft when it happened. Let me reiterate that there are NO LIGHTS on the forest top brighter than a pin light. The only thing I kept thinking was that if  this was an american aircraft why was it not moving? No helicopter could have lights like this and still fly, and no plane could hover in the same spot for 15 minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I searched the local paper this morning to see if anything had been reported. I didn&#39;t find anything about it. That&#39;s when I saw this website. I was tempted to phone the police last night, but what was I going to say...&#34;I saw a UFO&#34;? I haven&#39;t even told any of my friends at work. I continued to watch after the light went out, but the only thing I saw was a number of cars driving on the road at the bottom of the forest hills. It seemed like the numbers of cars traveling that road had increased significantly, but I can&#39;t be sure. I&#39;m not normally looking and counting the cars. I do usually notice 3/4 cars a night and there were atleast 10 last night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was hoping that it was because numerous people had seen the lights and it would be reported in the paper. I was never frightened during this experience until my Mom said &#34;if you get a visit tell them whatever they want to know&#34;. This, of course, scared the crap out of me! At 10:45pm my baby started screaming and I was scared something had happened. Perhaps I had seen too much? Maybe I was lucky because I couldn&#39;t find the camera?  I think the screaming stemmed from a first tooth being born, not aliens poking and prodding my baby. I slept at the foot of my bed so that I could look out our sliding glass window in our bedroom. My protection: a pillow, a golf club, and some water. Yeah, I know, Hollywood is always right! I am totally freaked out about the whole situation, and will keep my eyes looking in that direction for quite some time. Whether I will actually tell any of my friends...will remain a mystery. I hope that others will report to this website the same sight and I can atleast share the experience with someone.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I was about to go inside when I saw what i thought was a very large meteor burning up. I saw an orange flare suddenly appear in the sky but instead of burning up it slowed down and passed over (I was still laying down) I could see it was orange, glowing, and elongated. Kinda like a cylinder or cigar. I yelled &#34;What the hell is that?&#34; and I must have sounded upset becuse my mother looked up and asked if it as an airplane and I told her I saw it enter the atmosphere and if it was a plane we&#39;d only see lights blinking. We watched it until it was too far away to see and it flew south in a slow (slower then even a single prop plane) curving zig zag. It just slowly went from left to right as it went forward. My heart&#39;s still racing. I&#39;ve seen a lot of strange lights out here in the past, but this is the first time I actually saw a shape. Though listed as Gainesville, this was actually 10 miles west of Gainesville<n>

It&#39;s been back once.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My dad was the first one to spot it, he was looking out at the bay when his attention was drawn to one of the island areas. At first it was a VERY bright light, it was stationary for a long time, then the light shut off, but whatever it was, was still there. It looked more flat, but with a slight dome on the top. I managed to get a picture of it when the light was off, a little while later it was totally gone. It came back to the exact same spot two weeks ago.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

It was so clear that it almost looked like some sort of firework.  It was visible to me for approximately 1-2 seconds before trees in our yard blocked the view.  I assume that it was a meteor or something similar but figured I should report it in case it corroborates with someone elses report.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
4/21/03 23:45|Houston (Canada)|BC|Triangle|approx: 10 seconds|HBCCUFO CANADIAN REPORT:  Large flying triangle slowly moving.|4/27/03|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/028/S28517.html|69|ndxe200304| Large flying triangle slowly moving.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had a local call today from a Houston resident who asked if I was free and if I would be able to drop by his home. I jumped into the car and drove the 2 kilometers east from Houston to his home, where they have a large farm. When I arrived I was greeted by the fellow who asked if I would come in and listen to a story of a strange event that took place April 21, 2003, at 11:45 p.m..<n> <n><n> <n><n> We sat down and he explained that he was walking home from his bothers place, (which runs along highway #16). As he got to where their driveway meets the highway, he saw a large blackened object (craft) flying very low over top the tree line and across the highway heading in an easterly direction coming from the west (?). He told me what caught his attention to the object was that being a completely clear night and gazing up at the stars there was a large part of the sky in which no stars were visible, but only the outline of something huge and dark in color. As we watched it a number of rolls of lights came on, which scared him darn near out of his pants. He told me he ran the short distance to their home and yelled to his mother to come out and look at what he was watching. Both of them stood looking at this massive object &#34;slowly&#34; fly by. All of a sudden the lights that were visible which had just came on, went out. Due to the farm having a great deal of trees around it, they soon started to lose sight of what ever it was that was flying by. (HBCC UFO Note: I asked if they could give me a rough idea what the shape of this object looked like. Both said it looked as if it might have been triangular in shape. How they came to this idea was due to the lights which came on. The witnesses said the rolls of lights on the underside of the craft seemed to sweep back from a point on an angle. (direction the craft was heading - so the front of it) Or to give a better idea may be if one was looking at a flight of geese in a V formation. The main colors of the lights were white, with some green/red also in the mix. They also reported that it looked as if there were three large rolls of the lights on the underside. I also asked if they could tell me the rough size of it. They both said it was &#34;massive&#34;, then looked at one another hoping, I guess one would come up with a better description of just how big this was. They said it had to have been close to the size of a large jet airliner, or a bit larger.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The sighting lasted approx: for 10 to 12 seconds before they lost sighting of it, after looking around the area where they live I figured that would have been a long time to view this due to so many trees which would have started to block their view of the object. &#34;No&#34; sound was heard what so ever. They also have a large dog in which seemed to be disturbed as the craft flew on by so they said. The fellow said the object  was approximately 400 to 500 feet above the tree tops, which was pretty darn low. (HBCC UFO Note: I wondered if the object had made some kind of change in it&#39;s flight path before the witness caught sight of it. These folks live right below Mount Harry Davis, so if it came from over top the mountain it would have had to drop approx: 1500 feet to arrive at the height the people reported seeing it at. Or I wondered if  the object had flown from the south, which would have taken it over, or close to the town of Houston, B.C. and then made it&#39;s turn easterly. Another strange thing they mentioned. (a little sketchy here), but their impression of it was that it had a large body  to it. Meaning it wasn&#39;t so much flat, but more raised at the top of it. ( Bulging at the top, but curved if one had blown up a balloon - They could not be completely sure of this, but as I mentioned, it was their impression of how they saw it).<n> <n><n> <n><n> The Mom said she hardly slept that night just thinking about it, the fellow didn&#39;t seem to have a problem with it after it was all done and over with. But I could certainly hear the excitmentment in their voices when they spoke about this event.<n> <n><n> <n><n> (HBCC UFO Note: Last year for all of 2002, as many of you know I dealt with a large amount of reported sightings. But I did not have many, or any come to think of it, these triangle sighting. This year, 2003 I have had a number of reports of these types of objects flying around my area here in the north, plus sightings from the lower mainland. I am starting to scratch what hair I have left on this bald head wondering what the heck is going on up here. I still am getting reported sightings from local residents, from Houston, Telkwa and Smithers of military vehicles which were running around the area after the July 29, 2002 sighting. Actually the first week in August 2002 when everything started showing up. Also what is interesting is, that more folks are coming forward telling me of all the flights that took place in the first week of August 2002 around these areas. Unmarked aircraft, both fixed wing and helicopters. And folks I can confirm a lot of this as I saw many of these aircraft myself. And they all were flying right over the tree tops, just as if they were looking for something. If that the case or not, I don&#39;t really know. But I have no doubt in my mind something major has, and still is taking place around the pacific northwest here in British Columbia.The witnesses, or most of them I can say are good reliable folks. Matter of fact even a few of the reports have come from people in positions of authority of different kinds. I also know I am only receiving a small fraction of the reports, as every week I hear of another sighting coming from a second or third party member. I don&#39;t bother to report these as I want the actual witness to step forward to give their account of what they saw. But there are still so many who are not wanting to come forward.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There has been a few other strange things that have taken place along Highway #16 throughout all the communities and I am working on an article on this as well. Why this area is anyone&#39;s guess. I know one thing for sure, there has been a &#34;ton&#34; of lights/objects seen flying south up over and through the Morice River Valley (or road). Now this may be reaching for the stars, but I am trying to think of everything I can to give me a clue to why so many sightings. Why so many being seen heading in the Morice area. Someone brought up an idea to me, saying that the government had closed a part of the Telkwa mountain range down because they transplanted some Caribou a few years ago to the area. Made me &#34;think&#34;. It may be just that, not wanting the snowmobiles frightening the animals which I certainly can understand, but then again is there possibly another reason.

I was very interested to see what the exact date would have been for their sighting, as I had a good report come into me of a large triangular craft which was seen approx: 2 kilometers east of Houston, B.C. on April 21, 2003. The witness I chatted with today was not completely sure of the exact date her and her husband witnessed, but it could have been on April 21, 2003.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I telephoned the witness I met today ( May 21, 2003) and made arrangements to meet at their home to discuss what it was they saw. This sighting took place approx: 8 minutes west of Houston. These folks, who I can say are very credible people and have a beautiful home sitting on a large parcel of land. The view they have of the surrounding area is really something. They also have a great view of the Telkwa mountain range where so many strange lights/objects have been seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We sat down and she proceeded to tell me the details of what was seen that night. The couple had already put their young children to bed earlier, and they were getting themselves ready for bed when the wife went to close their bedroom curtains when she saw a tight cluster of lights just sitting stationary in the sky, and not very far from their farm. The formation of lights also were not that high in the sky. She called to her husband to come and have a look with her, and he also was shocked at what he was seeing and could not figure out what the lights were. He proceeded to go and grab his binoculars and they both took turns viewing the lights. As they now had a better, and closer look at the lights, I was told that although it was dark, they could see a shape to the object. It looked like the letter &#34;C&#34;, but with lights on the outside, or the curved surface of the object. The colors of the lights went from a yellow/white, red and green. Another interesting thing about the lights were that each light took it&#39;s turn growing in brightness. This continued on for some time while the object sat in the one position. They also told me that the object did not move from it&#39;s position. The sighting lasted for approx: 20 to 30 minutes. (HBCC UFO Note: Due to the length of time the object/lights sat in the one position, I wondered if it could have been bright stars they may have been observing, but they told me that they told me whatever it was, was sitting far to low, and pretty close to their location. Both of them thought the object may have been hovering over highway #16, or at least close to it which is not far from their farm. Also other objects in the sky did move slightly (stars) and this object did not move as they had it lined up with a popular tree on their farm). They did open the window to see if any sound could be heard coming from it, but nothing. I also asked if they noticed any kind of reactions coming from the pets they have, and none was noted. Object/lights seen in the southwesterly portion of t! he night sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After watching this for a while, they closed over the curtains and went to bed, but having this still on their mind the wife got up and peeked out the window shortly after they settled in for the night and the object was gone. She told me this really frightened her, now wondering what it was they were looking at. I am sure many or all will not remember a sighting back in August 23, 2002 of a HUGE object in which these same folks witnessed, and captured on video. Not a half hour after she shot the video, and doing the rest of the dishes, she noticed another object and again caught this on tape. And I have viewed the tapes, and have them both here with me. So these local residents are seeing some strange things here in Houston, B.C.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thank you to the witnesses for their report.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Computer images, maps, etc.. of this object will be posted to my website soon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Brian Vike, Director HBCC UFO Research Canadian Toll Free UFO Hotline 1 866 262 1989 - Free call.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Editor: Canadian Communicator - Paranormal Magazine email: hbccufo@telus.net Website: http://www3.telus.net/public/wilbur8/hbcc_ufo_research.htm<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We express our gratitude to Brian Vike for sharing the report.

I had this feeling I was being watched, and whirled around expecting to see my supervisor Jimbo standing there ready to bust me.  Instead I seen this purple light like those the power company installed over to my trailer, them what makes everything look purplish.  The ships was tear drop shaped like a Hershey&#39;s kiss with a round bottom.  They was this windshield that was all bowed in like it had been in a bad wreck or something.  Behind the windshields was two glowing lights, kind of like eyes in that movie &#34;The Big Scary Eyes of Hades.&#34;  They moved independent of one another, so I&#39;m thinking they was not attached to the same being.  I dropped my blunt and tripped over a stack of pallets, sticking a rusty nail into my shin.  I was too scared to holler, so I run into the plant to tell ((name deleted)) the lift driver to help me.  ((name deleted)) drove the new battery-operated Caterpillar lift over, cause he never sets his big ass off that thing.  Since I could not speak from the fear, I pointed him to the light, which by now was glowing brighter. He drove the lift onto the dock when a blazing narrow beam of white light come down onto the forks.  The lift cut off and ((name deleted)) screamed like a woman.  Next thing I remember I was in the plant manager&#39;s office getting oxygen and a cool rag to my head.  ((name deleted)) still will not speak of this harrowing event.  I was given the remainder of the shift off with pay.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We will encourage the witness to have the second witness submit a report, as well.

I looked at the object thinking that it was a distantlyt approaching plane, but the object stayed stationary and moved side ways and upwards like no other aircraft I have seen. My Freinds who were also with me saw this object but they it was kite but the object was over the South common about half a mile away and was flying too high to be a kit. The object stayed there for about 15 then I loked to friend and loked back but the object had gone.

The object followed a near straight path from South to North about 1,000 ft. up and just off the Pacific coast.  It seemed to be moving faster than a commercial jet, but was two to three times as large, and made no sound that I could hear.

The sky was overcast at 2 in the afternoon with a low ceiling. There was no action at the airport. Davidson&#39;s is north overlooking south to the airport and my view is west. Earlier two army choppers flew slowly through the valley.The army was doing maneuvers around Vernon the previous week. At first we thought it was a signaling system that the army was trying as the army camp is directly south and in view of Davidson&#39;s Orchards.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The lights were on the ground and randomly flashing colors of pink,red,green blue and brilliant white. We looked through the binoculars and there were no people around it. We have agreed the size comparable to a single dwelling house. The knoll is about one kilometer away as the crow fly&#39;s. We watched it for about one half hour.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As an after thought the white light had a shadow line (my last report) which was not in the piece that broke away but remained in the curling end. I was thinking of a description. if I put a dot on a flashlight lens and then blew smoke in the ray the light behaved something like that. It swirled around the shadow line. I had to let the memory come unaided. I observed more than I thought. Because of the other sighting on the same hill (small mountain maybe 900 m) I had a feeling of X marks the spot. Two days ago I noticed a chopper circling the hill then it widened to the surrounding area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Brian Vike, Director HBCC UFO Research Canadian Toll Free UFO Hotline 1 866 262 1989 - Free call.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Editor: Canadian Communicator - Paranormal Magazine email: hbccufo@telus.net Website: http://www3.telus.net/public/wilbur8/hbcc_ufo_research.htm<n>

I was outside, having a cigarette with a friend, when to the north/northwest a formation of lights appeared out of nowhere above the treeline, behind the clouds.  It consisted of two longer ovals of turquoise blue light parallel lengthwise to each other, and a smaller red oval in between the blues at one end.  It hovered more or less stationary for approximately 2-3 seconds, then dashed off to the north/northwest horizon with no evident acceleration at a VERY fast speed.  There was no sound during the entire incident.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I saw it appear, then dash, while my friend only looked up in time to see it streak away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 2 other friends were inside the house, and did not witness the event.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It occured in a suburb of a minor midwest city, and even with the low cloud cover, we were far enough away from the city that there was no glow in the sky.

Suddenly, the red light began to zig zag up and down. It did this for 4 or 5 turns then stopped (continuing to flash sharply). Then it appeared to light up, then it shot out at an extremely fast pace (SW direction). This was like it went into light speed. The red light went from still, no motion to blast off. It looked very similar to a comet with a light tail.  I watched it for what seemed like 2-3 minutes. The evening was very calm and clear. No clouds and about 3/4 full moon.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

4/20/03 01:00|Middletown|DE|Triangle|about 3-8 minutes|Saw a craft with bright lights, watched it, saw it do an ABOUT FACE in midair and come straight back the same path it had been taking|11/8/03|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/032/S32879.html|90|ndxe200304| Saw a craft with bright lights, watched it, saw it do an ABOUT FACE in midair and come straight back the same path it had been taking<n> <n><n> <n><n> A friend and I were coming home from the movies southbound on RT. 13.  As we got closer to Odessa, DE, I noticed a really bright light in the sky, over in the distance, not too far above the tree line.  At first I payed little attention becuase i thought maybe it was a C-5 doing manuevers, which isn&#39;t uncommon around here.  I just thought it had it&#39;s gear down with the landing lights on.  After I looked at it again, and realized it had barely moved, I started watching it closer, and I said to my friend, &#34;Damn that&#39;s a bright light&#34;, that&#39;s when he started looking.  I still figured it was probably a C-5, but i watched it anyway.  As we came to a part of the road where it dipped down a bit, I noticed that the trees were about to come in the line of sight, and I expected to lose track of it, instead, i could see the light THROUGH the trees still.  I said &#34;Damn dude, I can see it through the trees, and he said something along the lines of &#34;Wow, that really is bright&#34;.  As we cleared the trees, we noticed it was getting closer torward us and RT. 13, but the light was just as bright.  As it came what looked to be lined up with RT.13, it started going parallel to the road,  and if I remember right, the light was just as bright as he started to head away from us to the south.  We came up to a red light, so we stopped, both still watching it as it turned around...but not like a normal plane, not even like a AV-8 Harrier could, it did a complete about face and came back torward us northbound in the SAME flight path as it had gone south in.  I&#39;ve NEVER seen any aircraft do this with the exception of a helicopter, and I&#39;m a huge flight buff since the age of about 4, and I was in and Air Force Auxillary.  When it happened, after I could finally break my attention away from the craft, I looked at my friend to see him already staring at me in disbelief, and at the same time, we both said &#34;Did you see that?&#34;.  My friend and I both could not believe what we just saw...even when the light turned green, we! still sat there and watched it, and as it got closer, it was obvious that it was going to come directly over head, so I got out. The craft had roughly about 4 to 6 BRIGHT white lights, and they were formed a triangle shape, and really resembled that of the leading eadge of a large plane.  I couldn&#39;t make out the shape of the actual craft because of the lights.  The thing that baffled me was as it got closer and closer, I heard no noise, I even told my friend to turn the car off, which he did, and even as it passed, the only sound we heard was a very low, kind of hum, NOTHING like that of an aircraft engine, prop, turbo-prop, or jet.  As I looked at it...it was really hard to judge distance, it looked like it was both big, and high above, yet at the same time, it looked small and really close to the ground.  Neither of us said anything to anyone, yet 3 days later, while I was in class in school, a friend of mine said she and a friend saw a UFO a few weeks before, and that it had really bright white lights, and it was also near RT.13, I just got goosebumps.  I was just speaking to the friend that was with me about it, and he said someone he spoke to saw the same thing, on the same night, but he&#39;s not sure who it was.<n>

My grandfather was celebrating his (deleted by HBCC UFO) so we decided to get the whole family (mostly from Ontario) to come visit and have a little party.  We rented a hall and booked a near-by hotel in the small town.  The party began at 2 in the afternoon and we had a nice day.  It was getting later, it was around 6 or 7 at night on April 19, 2003 and the sun was starting to set.  I had thrown my hip out of joint the day before and it was starting to hurt so I thought I would go back to the hotel room and lay down for a while.  I was walking down a back alley toward the setting sun when I saw something zooming across the sky at an unbelievable pace.  (I remember squinting my eyes to try and get a better look).  As it continued it&#39;s path out of the sunlight, I could see that it was a very large triangle (at first I thought it may be a stealth plane) but that&#39;s when it stopped abruptly in the air and hovered for what seemed like a very long time.  I don&#39;t think stealth planes can do that, can they?  Anyway, it zigged and zagged up into the sky (again at a jaw-dropping speed) never to be seen again.  Now I know a stealth plane can&#39;t do that! I went back to the hotel and pondered if I had really seen what I had just seen.  Things got very weird after that.<n> <n><n> <n><n> (Personal information deleted by HBCC UFO Research)  Thank you to the witness for filing their report.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Brian Vike, Director HBCC UFO Research Canadian Toll Free UFO Hotline 1 866 262 1989 - Free call.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Editor: Canadian Communicator - Paranormal Magazine email: hbccufo@telus.net Website: http://www3.telus.net/public/wilbur8/hbcc_ufo_research.htm<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We express our gratitude to Brian Vike for the report.

We have shared our experience with friends and family. Some are in the military. Nothing conventional fits what we saw. WE have just watched the show on the history channel 6-11-03 about the sightings in mexico. Some of the objects (balls) shown were like what we saw and this is what prompted me to list our sighting.

Two lights that looked exactly like stars started moving down the sky past the other stars.  One &#34;star&#34; seemed to be leading the other, and they made a fairly sharp turn together before disappearing in about 15 secs or so.  I was the only one who saw this.  About 5 min later, I saw a single &#34;star&#34; make its way straight down the sky, making a couple slight changes in direction along the way.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This also lasted about 15 sec and one of my friends saw most of this.  I never saw anything else that night but I was especially puzzled about the first sighting, since one light seemed to be following the other.  As they made their sharpest turn it was almost like they were on a race track and one was swerving around the corner to keep up with the other.  These 2 lights never went far from eachother.  If you&#39;re in Anchorage, keep watching the skies.  I was surprised I got a second sighting after the first, perhaps this may be seen again.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
4/19/03 00:00|Seattle|WA|Unknown|unknown|Possible abduction? MILAB? Strange visit from the health department?|2/8/05|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/041/S41802.html|96|ndxe200304| Possible abduction? MILAB? Strange visit from the health department?<n> <n><n> <n><n> Hello  An incident occured on the night before Easter in 2003, and its been nagging at me and my family since.<n> <n><n> <n><n> That night, my mother, who had a nasty respitory illness, woke up in what she described was like a drug induced haze (she was once a nurse in Emergency rooms, and has herself had a few surgeries, and thus knows very well what medical anesthesia feels like, and she said this was very similar). She saw fuzzy images of what appeared to her as best she could tell, were people in full surgical garb. One of the &#34;doctors&#34; called her by name, told her everything would be ok. She remebers a needle being inserted in her arm, and blood taken. She couldnt speak, other than grunt, and was very confused before she blacked out again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The next morning she woke up. She saw a needle pincture in her arm and was very concerned. My stepfather, who was also in the bed with her, woke. He also had one, which scared him. To understand better, my stepfather has a serious phobia of needles. When he sees the doctor, he must be sedated before they can poke any sort of needle into him, because he literally vomits and passes out on seeing needles. he often must leave the room when they doctors take blood from my mother. He remebered nothing, but was feeling very drowsy and run down, and felt confused. They both came in and asked me if I had let paramedics in the night before, and I told them no.<n> <n><n> <n><n> That night, I myself was playing on my computer. Since I was working a grave yard shift at the time, I had only woken up at about 8 P.M. Yet after 2 hours of being awake, I suddenly was overcome with such drowsiness and exhaustion, I simply crawled onto the cot I slept on, and fell asleep within minutes, which was VERY strange. I woke up feeling sore all over, which was weird, but no puncture or needle marks on my arms at all, and no recollection of anything the night before.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When they both showed me these strange needle marks, i was indeed very interested. They told me they themselves fell asleep suddenly, probably around the same time i did, judging by what was on TV when they fell asleep.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What was even weirder is that my cats, all of them were very spooked the next day. This was very interesting, as my largest cat never gets spooked. Vacuum cleaners, dogs, loud sounds, nothing phases him, yet I found him hiding under a bunch of boxes, and he hissed at me everytime i tried to reach in and get him. The other cats were terrified and hiding in other places.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My stepfather also told me the door was unlocked. I remeber him locking the door every night, and remembered him doing that. We lived in a bad area (White Center) and always made sure it was locked, but the door seemed locked, and the cats would go no where near it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Anyway, this whole thing was very strange. We have been puzzling over it for these past two years, and Ive done a bit of research, and cannot seem to find any possible explainations. Although I have always been interested in the UFO phenomenon, and have done alot of personal research and study, and even had a sighting years ago, at that time, it seemed that the alien abduction theory was not a serious question.<n> <n><n> <n><n> However, as I do more looking into it, I have become a bit more confused. I feel that perhaps submitting a report to NUFORC would be the best option. If you folks dont do abduction reports, feel free to send it on to whoever you feel would be best for this subject, if it is indeed typical of abductions. If there is a mundane explaination, like a bizarre midnight visit from the health department (the SARS epidemic was big news at the time, and my mother did have a bad lung infection), Id like to know as well. Im really interested in getting to the bottom of this &#34;high strangeness&#34; and am looking for an answer, mundane or otherwise.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Feel Free to contaqct me for any further information by phone or email or other, and Ill be happy to answer any questions.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thank you.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Sincerely, ((name deleted))<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of sighting is approximate.

The triangle was about half the size of box part of the big dipper.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The three lights were very close to the size of the stars and close to the size of satellites but these lights were moving at the same speed and in the same direction making me disbelieve my first assumption that they were sattelites.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;m not positve of the direction they were heading in but i&#39;d guess south-east.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I excitedly yelled for my friend to look at what iwas watching once i was sure i was seeing something unusual.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After my friend got out of his tent and i had pointed out the three lights to him it soon began to change course and if it was a solid object banked like a plane and each light with the point first vanished in turn.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I say &#34;if it was soild object&#34; because i didn&#39;t notice if i could stll see stars in the space between the lights but it the lights certainly moved as if connected.  They appeared to be extremly high in the sky travelly at normal plane altitude or higher.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was no unusal sound that i heard.  it was a clear night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The duration of sighting was less than 1 minute probably about 30-40 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We both feel that we saw something quite unexplainable.<n>

I took some back roads out of town, one of them running directly along the local airport, Dupont by name.  This is a very small airport, handling only small, private recreational craft.  No jets of any kind, including small Lears can land at this airport.  The runways are too short, for one thing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I turned off Roods Lake Road (airport address) east onto Haines Road, a huge shadow passed over my car.  It was so big that I thought, &#34;What the hell was that!?&#34;  There was no noise.  I drove a few more feet, slowly now, up the road all the way looking to my right.  A line of trees blocked my view for several hundred yards, but when I could see I came to a stop and looked hard.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first, I didn&#39;t see anything, and then, I could.  It was huge and hovering over the short, dirt runway.  It was shaped like (and this is the only  thing I can equate it to) the starship from Star Trek-Enterprise, the one with the lady commander.  Please don&#39;t laugh.  I only describe it like that because it&#39;s the only correlation I can think of.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The thing that makes it even stranger is that this thing looked &#39;cloaked.&#39;  By that, I mean you couldn&#39;t see it at a glance, but if you stared (like I did), you could see the shape and the size being surrounded by some kind of shiny, reflective shield or something.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I didn&#39;t hang around, and no other cars came along, or I might have stopped them, to say, &#34;Look!!&#34;  I drove my 27 miles north at speeds of 70-80 miles an hour, checking all the way to Clifford, MI., making sure that thing wasn&#39;t following me.  I didn&#39;t tell anyone about it for weeks.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD))<n>

At first i thought it was just a rabbit as there are rabbits in the area. I looked over and noticed it was about 4 feet high and running on two legs.  I stopped, i was in complete awe, it ran in bewteen 2 cars and then i lost track of it as i was in a complete state of shock.  At first i thought i was just seeing things so i moved on for a bit only to stop and then make way to where i had seen the alien.<n> <n><n> <n><n> as i got closer to where i saw it i got increbily frighten and had a weird feeling that i was being watched.  I began to panic so i tried to calm myself down and kept looking around.  After finding it was gone i went home.  The alien had a kinda brownish green legs, as it ran it seemed to be ducking or hunching over like it was trying not to be seen. i walked home and every few mins i would look over my back.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

We do not know what caused the phenomenon, but we do observe that the Sun is almost directly behind the photographer, which explain the the bright reflection from the mountain top, if the object is a three-corner reflector.  It may be a device for accurately measuring the seismic changes in the movement of the volcano with light beams, although that is purely a guess on our part.  PD))<n>

After a few mintues I looked to the southwest sky and it looked like a really bright satellite moving across like they normally would. after a few seconds I noticed that it really didn&#39;t have a geo-synchronous orbit like a Satellite. For about 10 seconds it went behind the clouds, at which point I thought I had lost it but my friend pointed it out when it came out from behind the clouds. As it came out from behind the clouds, it started to drop in the sky, somewhat zig-zagging and moved toward the horizon at which point it was moving too fast and was too bright to be a satellite. Just as it was due south fairly high above the horizon,  we noticed two very faint lights moving towards the main big light at the same time. Right after they started to move together the lights suddenly disappeared, sort of like a fading effect. Didn&#39;t see anything else after that.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

We got about half way through limington on back roads to get to Naples when we both started to see this bright blueish white light there was in between 5-7 light in a row going im a downward direction. The ship seemed to be in the woods blinking every 30 secounds.we poundered what it was for a few min. not panicing at first thinking that that was strange. Driving on thinking it was gone now because the lights were not apparent now we both were a little freaked out but in a pumped way we both wished we had our cam. but we didnt we got about 1 mile and a 1/2 when suddenly the light was just there again in the woods a little bit higher now but this time much brighter and more freakwent flashing light. now I am scared I tell my freind to speed but he says he dosnt want to break the speed limit finally when he said ok screw it were getting away from this thing the car starts runnig strange and the radio was now going static I  about started to cry ( I have always belived in this type of thing but never thought that it would happen to me.)   so here we are the car acting up both in shock/panic now.  Thelight still there near the tree tops and still just as bright. when we noticed how close we were to our friends house maby 5 miles to the house now this is the part that made me relly confused a car went by us and when  looked back there were no break lights behind us we got to our friends house freaked out as hell both of didnt sleep the hole night we wacthed eachother like hawks as if we were against each other or somthing the next day we wnt to my friends down the road a little bit befor returning to back to our friends house he had also seen it when we went to the stor i overherd a guy talking about how strang things were happening last night it was strange-the dogs barked all night-we stayed up and others also saw it<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  One of two similar reports from Maine, submitted by the same witness.

We arived in wikieup arizona around 8:50 pm and we drove straight through with out stopping the town is very small and takes about 5 min to get through. Once we got out of the town we drove another 5 to 10 min when I saw 2 Very large gold lights with an orange hugh to them. As soon as my wife looked at them they both disappeared at the exact same time. she tryed to tell me they were most likely planes that had turned from us but there were at least 6 planes in the air that we could see all of them had blinking lights and were only 1/5 the size of the strange lights we had just seen and the planes were no where near as bright. A few min up the road my wife noticed the computer compus in my suv was now saying C witch we had never seen it do. a min or two after she pointed this out the lights reapeard  on the right side of the road and once agian as soon as we spoted them they just vanished. by this time I was feeling very freaked out do to the fact that besides other people driving on this road we were alone and I was in the midle of the desert with my wife witch I felt as though I need to protect but I felt very vonurable. about 5 to 10 min down the road we both saw one apear right above the mountian off to the right of us it was followed by 6 other identical lights that apeared right next to it one after another I had just enough time to screach to a full stop, throw the suv in park and open the door and then they vanished in just the opisit order that they appeared the last one that appeared was the first one to vanish and so on after standing out side for a few min we started driving agian when I saw a single one of the lights to are left about the say area we saw the first 2 lights it took a bit longer to vanish then the others. im guessing around 45sec after this we came up in to a mountain area that last for about 10 min once through this you drive over a narrow bridge on the oposit side is a senic view area just after coming out of the mountians we could see the 7 lights already light up way off in the distance slowly moving together twords the pheonix area this time it stayed lit up for a couple of min at least becuse I crossed the bridge pulled in to the senic view area and my wife and I both got out and watched it then all at once all 7 lights were gone we stayed at the senice view for about 5 min so my dog could go to the bathroom after that we were back on the road we had no more sightings of the lights untill we were about 7 to 8 min out of wickenburg when I saw the last one off to the left but this time behind us a bit it vanished within a few seconds when we finaly saw the first houses of wickenburg my wife pointed out that the compus was now working agian. We didnt see any more lights that night or on our trip back from az to las vegas.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I will try and make and send some drawings in of what we saw<n>

Nor did it have any flashing lights. It was a constant white glow.

The first was in the late morning and the second in late afternoon. The morning sighting was as follows: I was on my way down my street when I looked up to the NE and spotted two identical ojects that were round and white flying side by side. One would pull ahead and then fall back. It did this a few time until both were again side by side and continued in a southerly direction. There altitude was apx. 1000 ft. and they were apx. 30 ft. in diameter.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My second sighting was in late afternoon while on my roof. Due to the earlier sighting I brought my binoculars. I was looking NNE when the same two ojects came into my field of vison. I put down the binoculars to get a better look since they were moving much faster then the first sighting, also they looked to be at apx. 1500 to 2000 ft. They slowly went into a westerly curve and were gone in seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> These objects were not birds, weather ballons or any other objects I have seen in the sky during my lifetime. Also I may add that I live below the flight path for commerical aircraft 5 mins. from landing at Laguardia Airport.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Woken by flash of light and loud explosion sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Looked out the window to see a bright orange light moving slowly high in the sky. Estimate slow plane speed.Have looked on it with binoculars and seen that it is an object with an orange light on the bottom side with an elongated egg shape upwards.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It nearly always appears near my house. I treated the first siting as a one off which I would not see again. But it is almost a weekly event now. Its coming seems to come from the explosion which seems to occur from nothing visible. There is smoke after the bang [seen once as I rushed outside the 3rd time]. It seems as though a prank is being played on me but now I doubt that. It&#39;s too big to be fireworks about 2m x 4-6m in size???. I experienced a loss of time while I was making a snack. I found myselflooking for a cup of drink I  thought had just poured and found it in the lounge room half consumed. THAT WAS FREAKY. I had seen only one siting A WEEK EARLIER at that time and had forgotten about it. On 2 occassions I had someone with me to see it. When I heard the explosion last night the words &#34;4pm&#34; flashed into my mind. I know all this sounds crazy. I had just had an argument with my wife about what we had been seeing recently, telling me to not mention it to anybody. But when it happened again that night she was not so so any more. The explosion sound is so loud it&#39;s like the place is being bombed. I feel like I have been targeted for something. I am having trouble sleeping because of the expectation that it will come back. I  am not afraid of grey aliens coming into my house. That&#39;s a bit unlikely. I had just come to the conclusion how crazy the x-files series was. But this is too real for comfort.<n>
4/15/03 21:50|Hoensbroek (Natherlands)||Diamond|2 hours|Triangle or Diamond shaped objects in Limburg, the Netherlands|5/27/03|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/028/S28939.html|114|ndxe200304| Triangle or Diamond shaped objects in Limburg, the Netherlands<n> <n><n> <n><n> Probably one of the many sightings but every one counts! I was sitting at home, my girlfriend was at a girlfriend of hers, and she came in early with her friend. They had been sitting on the roof terras drinking and chatting as  my girlfriend looked up and saw a triangle or diamond shaped luminous object. Color was like all colors of the prisma, but subtle like a cut diamond. The objects were at least 5 a 6 times the size of the biggest stars we could see As they where looking at it they spotted a few more. She told me to come outside and see for myself. They spotted at least 6 other objects but 2 of them I have seen with my own eyes. IF you looked very concentrated it looked as if there were three light or that they where triangle. One of the objects was in front of the house and one on the other side of the house. The distance was far, but objects were subtle changes in color. In the south of the Netherlands were i live, we don&#39;t have so much light pollution and it was a clear sky, so the view was perfect. The object on the northside of the house, was there for about 2 and a half hours. In a steady position, so stars where moving, but not the object. We ran a few times from the front to the back of the house, and i was also running in and out of the house posting messages on http://www.angularmomentum.net and ran upstairs to a friend of mine, the building is the old townhall of Hoensbroek, so we live with few more people there. I asked the guy if he ever seen a ufo, his girlfriend was there too, and she thought I was joking, I got them to the window on the other side from where they live and the object was there. Clearly visible. My friend looked at me in disbelieve, but his girl was enthousiast what she seen. I ran down again and one of hour neighbours who was walking the dog late, was curious what we where looking at, when I explained she was like totally amazed. Stars dont twinkle like this object did and it was there already for at least 25 minutes. We where thinking it could have been a plane in the beginning, because we have a lot of awacs flying over.! We got Seedorf, brunssum and other american milletary basis in the neighbourhood. But when we saw a airplane fly over, we had a good reference that it wasn&#39;t an airplane. On Januari the 27 2003, we have seen the same object in another place, but relatively near the one that we were seeing on the northside (front) the 15 of april. That object was slowly descending, we had to get home, and we weren&#39;t sure, so we lost interest. Anyway, The plane crossed our viewpath of the object, so that must give you some poor reference how far it was. I can&#39;t tell you how far the object was, but it must have been at least 3 or 4 kilometers. I am not experienced observator. I talk about this stuff on message boards, but never have seen actually until I moved to the south.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We have been watching for half an hour and i have been checking on it every ten minutes and it was there until a two hours later when. I am sure we will have more sightings here because I have seen three of them on two occasions, but my girlfriend has seen more as she had a better view from that roof terras.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Maybe i can ask her if she can send you guy&#39;s a report, because she has seen objects coming out of objects, but that was high up in the athmosphere. Also satellites were that night clearly visible. I am from Amsterdam and there is no stars in the sky, to much traffic lights, here in Hoensbroek you can look at the milky way, quite amazing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I talked to my friend upstairs a few days later and he told me he had never seen anything like it. On this message board, is a description in a timeline of what happend............<n> <n><n> <n><n> excuse my english.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

One witness on his way to the Huckleberry Mine outside of Houston. At approx: 70 kilometers south from town he saw a multi colored object sitting in one position in the distance a head of him. He said to me that he thought it was a bright star due to it twinkling different colors. But after a second or two he thought it could not be that as it was totally over cast. The fellow said he had some extra time before he had to be at his work place, so he stopped and watched the lights for approx: 4 to 6 minutes before it dropped down suddenly behind a mountain. He also claims that the lights dropped &#34;straight&#34; down rather quickly. Because he was at a distance from it, he certainly could not hear any sounds coming from the thing. The lights/object did not make any sudden movements, it just sat in the one position before disappearing behind the mountain. In the area there are no towers, or anything else which would cause any strange lighting. The area in question is very rugged and wild.<n> <n><n> <n><n> HBCC UFO Note: When the chap was telling me the story, I first thought it may have been a star also, but after hearing it was a overcast night/morning and hearing that the lights/object dropped quickly straight down behind a mountain, I kind of ruled out this sighting as being a star. Whatever it was, it left an impression on the guy.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thank you to the witness for his report.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Brian Vike, Director HBCC UFO Research Canadian Toll Free UFO Hotline 1 866 262 1989 - Free call.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Editor: Canadian Communicator - Paranormal Magazine email: hbccufo@telus.net Website: http://www3.telus.net/public/wilbur8/hbcc_ufo_research.htm<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We express our gratitude to Brian Vike for submitting the report.

I know that commercial craft do not fly during one and two in the morning in the direction they were flying at any other time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My sighting took place while I was standing in my driveway about 1:30 am.  Noticing a very high flying jet flying on a direction I would guess at w/nw.  As I watched the jet fade away across the lake I witnessed ,on the exact same heading and on the same line two glows one above the other about 1/2 inch in size from arms length.  They did not have a destinctive outline other than an oval shape and they did seem to me to be an energy.  At the time it seemed odd that they would be following on the exact heading as the jet that I was watching.  I should say that they were travelling at a higher speed than the jets.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Please return an e-mail if this incounter interests you.<n> <n><n> <n><n> By the way I had been listening to a show on ufo&#39;s on shortwave which I believe is aired every second tuesday.

4/14/03 23:20|Houston (Canada)|BC|Light|5 to 6 seconds|HBCCUFO CANADIAN REPORT:  Single red light low over China Nose Mountain|4/22/03|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/028/S28468.html|122|ndxe200304| Single red light low over China Nose Mountain<n> <n><n> <n><n> A witness called to say while driving home from Perow, B.C. to Houston they witnessed a single red light flying rather quickly from the east heading west and very low. She told me that the red light was flying just over the top of China Nose Mountain. Actually a one point from her location, she watched the light fly over the tops of the mountains, but she claims that when it almost reached China Nose Mountain it rose up rather quickly to get over the peak and continued on at the same altitude after rising up to get over China Nose until she lost sight of it. This sighting lasted approx: 5 to 6 seconds. Just a dot of red light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> (HBCC UFO Note: I know exactly where she was when she observed the light, and you overlook the valley below and have great view of the mountains across the valley from Highway #16. The Bulkley River and a lot of farm land is below in the valley. I did some quick checking and as far as I know, no flights would have been around that area at that time. If it was a small personal aircraft the person flying it would have been crazy to fly in that area, or  to be honest any other area around here at this time of night and flying so low. So what this was, is anyone&#39;s guess. Mind you I have had a number of reports just like this coming from local residents over the past years. One other comment I will make on this report. Due to the view she would have had when she first saw it, the light had to have moving at a extremly fast rate of speed. The view of the mountains she was looking toward, you can see for miles and miles from her location on the highway. I would certainly rule out a small aircraft in this case.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thank you to the witness for their report.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We express our gratitude to Brian Vike, Director of the Houston, British Columbia, Canada UFO Research organization, for sharing this report.

He had taken a short break from his office and was sitting on a bench at 2nd Street &amp; 3rd Avenue in Cedar Rapids wearing ray-blocker sunglasses when he sighted what he at first thought was a flock of birds.  However, as the formation approached to nearly overhead (moving from north to south) he realized that he was seeing at least 5 shiny metallic objects (no further apart in the formation than their own diameter), and to his amazement he saw that the objects constantly switched positions as the &#34;tight S&#34; formation rather slowly moved south at an estimated 30-50 mph INTO/AGAINST the wind. (It should be noted  here that weather conditions were as follows: Clear; 87 degrees Fahrenheit; visibility 10 miles; WIND OUT OF SSW AT 26 mph, GUSTING TO 35 mph)  With 5 objects moving against such a strong wind, it seems reasonable to rule out balloons as an explanation for what this witness saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Witness estimates that objects were perhaps at around 2,000 feet when first sighted, but that they may have elevated somewhat as they drew closer to overhead.  (Whether this perception is accurate, of course, is not known.)  Witness observed a military jet a couple of miles away heading in the opposite direction as the formation, but it is not known if that pilot was aware of the formation.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Local police and sheriff&#39;s departments received no reports, and the FAA had nothing on radar.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This, of course, remains an anecdotal, one-person account, but Iowa MUFON investigators are impressed with this individual&#39;s careful attention to detail as he sought to satisfy his curiosity over what he was seeing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Bev Trout Iowa MUFON State Director<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We express our gratitude to Iowa MUFON State Director, and other MUFON personnel, for following up on this case, and for sharing the results of their investigation.

We both saw what we thought was the moon shining through clouds directly ahead of us.  However, as we approached the light (which we mistakenly thought was approaching us) we thought it must be a helicopter with a large search beam coming from the front.  However, as we passed this flying object, it was obviously not a helicopter.  It was hanging perfectly motionless to the west of us over the ocean.  It was triangle shaped, had blue neon colored rings on either end and, according to my husband, the light strobed.  (This, I didn&#39;t see.)

Hwy 41, thinking it might be nearer.  We traveled north on this road and had passed through Warm Springs , Ga. and the community of Harris City, shortly after 9PM , we entered an isolated stretch of country road, when suddenly there appeared inside our vehicle, numerous red lights which seemed to be dancing around and moving erratically and very fast.  I was sitting in the back seat on the passenger side of the vehicle.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first, I thought it might be the police, and asked my brother in law to pull over.  My husband said it was not the police, their lights were blue. In the floor board of the vehicle where I was sitting, I could see a reflection or beams from the light spots. I looked up and the red lights were all over my husband and brother-in-law.  They were there from about fifteen to twenty-five seconds and suddenly and instantly they disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have made two trips back to the area, which is actually about ten miles from my home, on one occasion mid afternoon, and the other around 9 p.m. and could find nothing that would indicate that some individual could have caused this.

My brother and his wife live in Greenville, GA, located in West GA.  I picked them up at their home early Sunday AM to make a day trip to Albany, GA, to visit with our sister and her family.  The day was beautiful and we all had a delightful visit with them.  Around 6:30 PM we started our journey back to our homes.  We were riding in my Ford Explorer.  I was driving, my brother was next to me in  the front passenger side and sister-in-law was in the back seat behind my brother. We decided to take a different way back home than what we took on the journey down  for our visit.  We took a  road that is labeled HWY 41, a 2 lane road that is very isolative and very rural. The radio was turned off in the car as the the three of us were enjoying our own conversation and dialogue.  Night feel around 8:00 PM to 8:30 PM, as we are on day-light savings time.  There was only scant traffic on the road, since turning onto HWY 41.  We traveled through the town of Warm Springs, GA., Meriwether County and left the city limits headed North West (still on HWY 41)  to Greenville were my brother lives.  I saw no other cars, houses, or signs of activity while on this jaunt, until the event!! This is the account of the event to the best of my memory and through my preceptions.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At the &#34;blink of an eye&#34;and without in audio - visual or other sensory warning, a hoard of bright red lights manifested inside my SUV.  I panic initially for a second or two, then began slowing my speed  to around 30 miles/hour. I, at least felt some sense of security as I had 2 passengers with me.  MY sister-in-law yelled out to me calling my name, &#34;pull over, are those police lights?&#34;  I looked into the rear-view mirror and there was no police car and no other activity that I could see.  I looked at the clock in the car, it was 9:15 PM.  I could not count the lights as they were many, extremely eradic, strobbing, all apeared to be relatively small, I noticed some had short laser-like beam qualities as might be seen in some high-end disco club,  in short; they were ever where inside the car, except the trunk (I will comment on this very shortly).   By this time all three of us had vocally announced to one another that we were experiencing this event.  I felt totally out of control and knew that I would not have a say-so as to the outcome of this event.  In awe, I knew what was happening was not of this World!!  I looked in the re-view mirror to check on my sisiter-in-law and saw her in a panaroma of bright red lights .  I turned my head briefly (as the car was still moving) to look at her and I noticed that there was none of these eradic, red lights in the trunk area of my SUV.  The red lights seem to be  focused on the front and back seats.  As my head was turned looking at her I noticed the same lights at her feet and legs, the floor board was a hue of red probably from the reflection from the briliant  display.  I noticed the same type pattern of red lights and activity ongoing with my brother as well. The floor board again was red hue as it was in the back seat.  I looked out the window and over the dash board onto the hood and did not see any activity as was being awesomely and eradically displayed in the front and back seat.  This event lasted about 15 - 25 seconds to long.  The event ceased, as quick as the onset, when a car or  motorcycle appeared in the distance approaching the opposite direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I asked my brother, as he knows the demographics of that area very well, where exactly was our location.  He replyed in slang type verbage the name of the general area,  that was know to him and others in his small community.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In closing,  police lights are not red!!   How does red-strobbing and some laser-like lights travel with you in a moving car?  How could they be inside and not outside?  Could this all be a gimmick or circus trick??  I don&#39;t think so!!~~~~~I know what the red lights were doing!!<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with this witness at considerable length, and we found him to be an exceptional witness.  We have spoken with one of the other two witnesses to this event, and she, too, sounded to us to be both sober-minded and eloquent, in her description of the event.  Please see the other two reports.  The case has been forwarded to MUFON/Georgia.  PD))<n>
4/13/03 21:15|Greenville|GA|Other|Appx. 30 seconds|MUFON/GEORGIA FOLLOW-UP REPORT:  Joint NUFORC/MUFON of Georgia Investigation, Meriwether County Georgia|10/31/03|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/032/S32497.html|130|ndxe200304| Joint NUFORC/MUFON of Georgia Investigation, Meriwether County Georgia<n> <n><n> <n><n> Joint NUFORC/MUFON of Georgia Investigation  The following MUFON of Georgia report was generated by a joint NUFORC/MUFONGA investigation regarding the events occurring on 13April03 at about 9:15PM on Georgia Hwy. 41 between Warm Springs and Greenville Georgia (Meriwether County). The principal MUFONGA investigators were Olivia Newton, State Section Director for the Lilburn Georgia area, and Jim Clifford, Deputy Director for Georgia Investigations.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On 15April03, Peter Davenport, NUFORC Director, contacted this writer, Tom Sheets, SD for MUFONGA. Mr. Davenport made MUFONGA aware of the highly unusual nature of this event and after additional discussion it was decided to have Georgia Field Investigators to probe further into the case.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The Newton/Clifford team was contacted by this writer and agreed to proceed in contacting the witness(es) and in visiting the event scene. As stated in the posted NUFORC report, the witnesses are related, two brothers and the wife of one brother, mature adults all. (All three witnesses posted accounts to NUFORC).<n> <n><n> <n><n> The primary witness in this case (W-1) lives in the north Georgia area near Atlanta. The FI team met with him and conducted an interview on 30April03. He recounted the occurrence originally posted to NUFORC. The FI&#39;s described W-1 as being very serious and intense, holding firm eye-contact with the FI&#39;s throughout the interview. W-1 was also concerned with the post-event emotional state of his older brother and wife, since they all felt that their lives had been changed by the event.<n> <n><n> <n><n> During detailed questioning, he went on to provide more details; describing the red round objects as being SOLID, and NOT transparent light; about the size of half-dollar coins; no detectable heat or cold seemed to have been produced nor was any odor noticed. The tiny objects were also described as giving off little beam like projections or rays when close to the floorboard, and perhaps numbered as many as fifty.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The FI team made arrangements to meet on 5May03 with W-1&#39;s older brother (W-2) and his wife (W-3), who reside in Meriwether County. A visit to the scene of the event was also planned.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The exact site was easily located on Hwy 41 about four miles south of Greenville. The FIs made photos and inspected the surrounding heavily wooded terrain. No signs of recent passage were noted (knee-high weeds and grass). Only a few houses dot the area. Later interviews with residents of the area turned up no productive leads, but some vague comments came out about &#34;unusual&#34; events in town, but with no specifics (this MIGHT (?) be related to the many past UFO reports of the 1990&#39;s as described below). FI Newton later visited the Franklin D. Roosevelt Airport in nearby Warm Springs but developed no new information.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The W-2 and W-3 interviews were conducted in their Meriwether County residence, which was described by the FIs as a neat rural Georgia home, full of family photos. Interviews were conducted separately, and consisted of recountings of the NUFORC posts. W-2 reiterated that one of the red discs had remained motionless on the very area of his recent colon surgery for about five seconds, while the others continued to whirl about. He later wondered if perhaps this object had possibly destroyed any cancer cells that might have remained after the surgery.<n> <n><n> <n><n> W-3 was described as an especially genuine, forthright and honest person. In fact, FI Newton ranked her as one of the best witnesses she&#39;d ever interviewed (and she&#39;s interviewed hundreds). W-3 recounted her NUFORC post, and corroborated other details described in this report(s). According to FI Newton, before MUFONGA&#39;s involvement in this matter, W-3 was so aggressive in her search for answers, that she automatically undertook chores normally completed by FIs. W-3 visited the Meriwether County Sheriff&#39;s Department, the local GBI office (Georgia Bureau of Investigation) and also met with some residents in the sparsely populated area of the event. However nothing was developed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> FI Newton concluded that these three witnesses were extremely credible, and NEVER displayed any body language or clusters of kinesic-like signals that would indicate deception of any sort. Newton indicated that these witnesses felt that they were &#34;chosen&#34;, and were being scanned by these tiny objects for whatever reason.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The FI team considered many causes in this case. Ball lightning (especially fragmenting ball lightning ref. Wm. Corliss &#34;Remarkable Luminous Phenomena in Nature&#34; GLB9......though the weather was clear and mild); pranksters hiding at the roadside to ambush motorists with laser pointers; automobile deodorizers that exude mist and thus might refract light; natural &#34;spook&#34; lights or glowing plasmas and other such things. Due to their large number, bizarre movements, apparent solidity, and the object&#39;s close proximity to the witnesses, these mundane explanations were set aside. During his interview, W-2 stated that he may have observed a &#34;rolling red phenomenon&#34; just outside the window of the vehicle in the instant before the tiny objects appeared inside, but it was so brief he could comment no further.<n> <n><n> <n><n> FI Newton discussed this case in depth with a local physicist and two geologists. These learned scholars could provide no helpful information other than what we already knew. The Sheriff of Meriwether County served as a police SWAT/Medic and was an associate when this writer was Chief of Police in College Park Georgia. This writer discussed the case with him. He had received no similar reports, but advised that he would contact MUFONGA ASAP if anything turned up. The Sheriff&#39;s brother is also a GBI Agent and an associate of this writer and would likewise forward any information obtained via his channels.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As indicated by FI Newton, it should be noted that a very short distance south of the event scene is Warm Springs Georgia, the site of President Franklin D. Roosevelt&#39;s &#34;Little White House&#34;. FDR spent much time there in the 1930&#39;s and 1940&#39;s due to the geothermal springs and their reputed healing qualities for polio victims. FDR passed away there in 1945. While such unusual geology is found in a few places around the USA, it is unknown if such terrain might somehow be connected to this case. It should also be noted that the area of the Georgia-Alabama state line experienced a 4.9 magnitude earthquake at 4:59AM on 29April03, 16 days after the Meriwether County event. The quake location was at 34.51N 85.60W placing it about 30 miles NW of Rome Georgia, which would make the quake center an estimated 130 miles or so NNW of Meriwether County. The Brevard Fault line begins some miles north of Lagrange George, running NE toward South Carolina.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Several major newspapers in the southeast, including the Atlanta Journal-Constitution, picked up the case from this writer&#39;s &#34;MUFONGA Updates&#34; and printed the story of the investigation and these confidential witnesses. The by-lines referred to the event area as &#34;BOOGER BOTTOM&#34; due to our informal name for that vicinity. FI Newton, along with W-3, discovered that the local residents used that term when referring to the area. The term was originated long ago when illegal liquor was manufactured in these woods, and the &#34;moonshiners&#34; wanted such a connotation to hopefully keep revenue agents (!) and other trespassers away. The term &#34;Booger Bottom&#34; DOES NOT refer to any &#34;portal area&#34;, anomalous zone etc. It&#39;s strictly a local nickname for the above stated reasons. In fact, a bestselling book and major motion picture, &#34;Murder in Coweta County&#34;, starring Johnny Cash and Andy Griffith, somewhat illustrates how the area got it&#39;s name.........a true tale of moonshine and murder. The moonshiner and murderer, John Wallace, owned and lived in the area known as &#34;Booger Bottom.&#34; During the inquiry, we also received several citizen emails describing this &#34;true to life&#34; legend.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Additional Notes- Meriwether County is on the eastern side (and considered an outlying part) of an area once known nationally by Ufologists as the &#34;Troup-Heard UFO Corridor&#34;. From about the mid-1980&#39;s through the late 1990&#39;s there were perhaps as many UFO reports received from this area as in Pine Bush N.Y. or Gulf Breeze Florida or even the &#34;Mysterious Valley&#34; of the southwestern USA. This writer and especially my associate, former SD John Thompson, spent much time through the late 90&#39;s investigating these cases. While this report is not the place to recount these events, it should be noted that the area WAS, and perhaps remains, one of those localities that has an abundance of UFOs, unknown entities, and other paranormal type occurrences.<n> <n><n> <n><n> FI Newton has commented that throughout the many weeks of this investigation, the witness&#39; accounts have remained consistent......from their NUFORC postings to their &#34;sit-down&#34; interviews, including conversations with this writer and even during a national radio/Internet broadcast with Jeff Rense and Peter Davenport........consistent one and all.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As it now stands, MUFON of Georgia believes these citizens encountered multiple unknown anomalous objects, up close and personal, on Georgia Hwy. 41 on 13April03.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A report regarding this investigation is also to be filed in MUFON&#39;s &#34;World UFO Database&#34;.<n> <n><n> <n><n> MUFONGA would like to thank Peter Davenport for passing this case to us for additional investigation.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Best Regards,  Tom Sheets, State Director-MUFON of Georgia  Jim Clifford, Deputy Director for Georgia Investigations  Olivia Newton, State Section Director- Gwinnett, Dekalb, Rockdale Counties<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We express our gratitude to Tom Sheets, and Georgia/MUFON, for following up on this fascinating case.

(Driving home)<n> <n><n> <n><n> My wife, my son and I were driving home around 7:30 pm. when my son of 10 had pointed to a bright light hovering around 70 feet in the air, I pulled the car immediately  over and the object changed from a single bright light to about 12 or 14 pinpoints of white lights in sets of two all along the side of the object. It was long and seemingly sausage shaped or cylidrical. The Twilight made the object barely visible against the horizon.  I quickly rolled down my window to listen for any sounds like helicopters or airplanes since there is an USAF refueling base within 25 miles south of location of sighting. There is also an airport in Old Town for local flyers. The three of us observed there was no sound at all. The object then started to move away and up in to the sky with an extreme acceleration leaving a small vapor trail that quickly diminished within seconds. It was no more then a second or two before it was completely out of sight. The whole occurence was maybe a little over a minute long. My son expressed an urgency to know what it was since it had no sound and moved at such a high speed. He also pointed out that there were no blinking or strobing lights like the small planes and helicopters that we see regularly around this area all hours of the day and night. I was unable to tell him what it was.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I saw it on Sunday 4-13-2003, as I exited a building materials store in Gresham/ Wood Village, OR. It first appeared as a black speck above the near horizon, and stuck around eight minutes or so. It had no glow, at first appearing black or blue black. Then it started rotating emitting a clear gaseous substance around it, visible during the sighting and in photos. It then changed its rotation, now producing a yellow-green substance from the three near &#34;bulbs&#34; two red and one green in the photos sent to NUFORC.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The sky condition was mottled with light and heavy dark rainclouds not too distant behind the orb, to the south.  The pictures are not enhanced except they are cropped to eliminate excess sky, reducing the photo file size.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As it flew (slowly) out of sight heading north over the store it glowed phosphorescent green-yellow-red, changing its shape to a flat slightly inclined (pitched) disk.  Total distance the orb traveled in the eight minute sighting was about 1/2 to 3/4 mile.  I would say the height above ground was about 1300 feet or 1/4 mile, and this height did not change much, if any.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The orb flew by overhead at what seemed maybe 2 mph, but was probably 6 mph after doing the math, when it wasn&#39;t hovering and rotating around end-for-end like a puppy chasing its tail. There appear to be two larger spheres (connected) from studying the pictures. Not only did it rotate end-for-end, it rotated on its own axis between the two larger spheres.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It also morphed shape and color almost continuously.  The pictures I got while the orb parked directly overhead, for a short duration, were poor due to my using the camera&#39;s digital zoom, and possibly the wrong mode setting.  The camera was new and unfamiliar to me at the time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> All photos and description as the orb was on approach, it appearing as a black speck, to its eventual departure are copied to NUFORC as they were imaged at time of the sighting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I wish that I had used the camera&#39;s movie mode, but did not think of it at the time due to the camera being new to me.  The camera is an Olympus C730 UltraZoom with 10x optical and 3x digital zoom.  Picture quality suffers with digital zoom, aside from hand-steadying problems too.  I wish it had a lens stabilizer.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There were light aircraft flying in the area probably doing touch and go landings at the airport, but they did not try to chase or encounter the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We have received the photos, and they indicate a tiny white speck against a blue sky with broken clouds.  The photos are ambiguous, we believe.  The object probably was more visible to the eye, than it is in the copied digital photos.  We do not know what the object was.  PD))<n>

Enjoying spring weather. The night sky had a hint of thin clouds. The moon was about 60%.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There were plenty of stars visible. I happened to look at the western sky which was towards Minneapolis and St. Paul and I saw 3 unusual lights coming towards us. I told friend to look as they were flying in a tight formation and at a speed that appeared to be at least 4 to 5 times that of airlines. We both watched as they flew from west to east in a tight formation. How could I know their altitude? I would guess 30 to 40 thousand feet. When they got near above us they changed places and revolved. They appeared triangular. They maneuvered in a precise manner. I have seen planes do stunts but nothing this precise at such a speed. They went back to a straight formation but a few seconds later maneuvered again. It was amazing and we needed to share this but unfortunately we had no camera.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was no sound nor contrails. They disappeared to our eyes but that was probably due to the thin layer of clouds and the distance.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It appeared to me that what I saw was 3 individual lights but they moved as one. I have seen satellites, planes, meteors, and some other things I couldn&#39;t explain. But this was special. I would like to know if others saw this or if any radar from military, airlines, or pilots saw this.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We made the comment that if not extraterrestial then it has to be something very special that we have.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

On Saturday night, April 12, 2003 between the hours of 8:30 PM and 9:00 PM, I was on the fishing bay bridge (Pensacola side) at pillar marker number 44 just before the so called &#34;hump.&#34;  I was facing directly due East with the 3/4 full moon brilliantly shining at an angle in the sky between 1 o&#39;clock and 2 o&#39;clock; and when I was facing directly south, the moon was brilliantly shining at an angle in the sky slightly beyond 12 o&#39;clock.  The night sky was crystal clear with no clouds in sight, and the temperature outdoors was about 50 degrees Fahrenheit.  While I was looking directly due east, I noticed a large, star-like object between 22 to 30 degrees above the eastern horizon, and the object appeared to be located near Navare or Fort Walton Beach.  It was flickering like a star that cyclically changed into different colors of red, green, and blue.  My first thoughts was UFO because the lights were changing in a timely color pattern.  It also appeared and felt to my perception to be inside our atmosphere, but the distant was too vastly away to make any definite identification in which I could clearly identify what I was seeing.  It almost seem like it had an oval shape to it which the elongated part of the object was facing upwards.  I was wondering to myself if I was the only person out of about a hundred people who were fishing on the bridge that night may have seen what I saw.  So in a UFO joking mood, I decided to briefly shined my floodlight for less than a few second directly towards the object as in playful mode to get the attention of whomever may be inside if it was a UFO (like who shined that light at me, somebody can see me thought) which at time I was still actually thinking it was possibly a large planet or star, and I wanted to get the attention of the people on the bridge so they might glance at the flood beam and gazes towards the direction that I saw the star-like object in the sky.  The floodlight&#39;s beam could not reach the object that I saw in the sky.  Since the object didn&#39;t move an! d it appeared to be stationary, I decided that the object I was seeing was just a large star or planet since some stars or planets do flicker and shine similar like the object that I seen.  But the object that I just described is not the main reason why I wrote this account.  It is what happened two to three minutes later after I briefly shined the flood light at the object (star).<n> <n><n> <n><n> While I was still facing directly east as I was fishing and becoming bored because the fish-bites were slacking, I saw an commercial airliner appear from out of the tree line directly from the North-East slightly over the bay.  The commercial airliner began making its slow, sharp bending approach about a mile out into the bay towards Pensacola&#39;s airport for landing.  As the commercial airliner was veering towards the airport, it looked like it had a zillion lights on it.  The commercial airliner disappeared from my viewing as it approached and  descended towards the Pensacola&#39;s airport landing strip.  The commercial airliner seem like it had been escorted because about 10 to 15 seconds later, two military aircraft appeared from out of the same direction and elevation the commercial airliner had just recently appeared.  The military aircraft didn&#39;t follow the same route that the commercial airliner took while it was approaching into Pensacola&#39;s airport. Instead, they made their turns towards Navare or Fort Walton Beach separating from each other as they flew towards those cities.  They also began flying in what appeared to be a zigzagging or searching pattern.  I could clearly see the shape of the military aircraft in the moonlight.  The military aircraft also had their identification lights on which were blinking red on one side of the wing, and blinking green on the other wing.  Their strobe lights could be clearly seen all the way across the bay.  Then about  30 seconds later, I saw an object come from the same direction and elevation the commercial airliner and military aircraft had appeared.  The direction of the object was either directly from the north or from the northeast at an angle of 45 degrees above the eastern horizon heading south.  This object seem like it had just tailed the commercial airliner or the military aircraft.  This object when first spotted appeared to be only 2 miles or less away from my position or 1/8 the distant from the fishing bridge to the midway bridge which is near t! he town of Midway.  This object was horizontally traveling at the same elevation the aircraft were flying and about the similar speed of a landing commercial airline, and the object was brighter than the brightest satellites; the object&#39;s light seem like the same intensity of arc-welding, yet, it almost seem like it was glowing but in a soft glowing manner of either a pure white color or of arc light color.  I can&#39;t recall if the object reflected a mirror image of itself onto the water&#39;s surface, but I think it did since it was so brilliantly illuminating.  The object also seem like it had a solid and spherical shape similar to a globe.  If the object that I was viewing was a satellite, it was too extremely low in orbit, for I seen satellite traversing the skies in the past.  This object had no distinguishing shape such as an outline in the moonlight, nor did it create any audible sound as it approached my position.  If I was to estimate the size of this object when I saw it at its closest approach to me of about a thousand yards or less, I would say it appeared no smaller than a baseball, or no bigger than a basketball.  When I first seen this object, I wasn&#39;t expecting it and it scared the blinky-blank out of me because the first thing that entered my mind after just shining the floodlight at the star-like object was &#34;OH blank!  That must be a UFO scout investigating who just shined a floodlight at the mother UFO ship!&#34;  My fear then ease to &#34;it must be a satellite because it looks like a satellite.&#34; But I was still wondering until after few seconds had past then I said to myself, &#34;That is an awfully low satellite going really slow.  It can&#39;t possibly be a UFO.&#34;  I was mesmerized by the object because I never seen anything like it traveling so low and slow and brilliantly illuminated.  But still this is not the main reason why I wrote this account.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What really caught my attention was the fact while I was watching what I thought may be a satellite traversing the sky, the object&#39;s (satellite?) illumination just simply turned off like somebody flick the light switch to the off position once it past my two o&#39;clock angle.  The object&#39;s light just didn&#39;t dim and fade away like other satellites that I seen in my past.  Just about a couple of miles before almost entering Gulf Breeze area, this object just instantly stopped shining its lights.  This object didn&#39;t even forwardly project a beam like a headlight beam.  I seen meteorite&#39;s in my past, and those meteorites had always left behind what I call a trailing light.  The object I saw traversing didn&#39;t have this trailing light for like I said, it originally look like a satellite.  The military aircraft never ventured into the area where I saw that traversing object where it just simply disappear in a blink of an eye after viewing it for at least 30 second to a minute.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Is it possible for satellites to just instantly blink out so far away from the horizon, or what I saw that night was truly an UFO possibly posing as a satellite?  I never in my past searched for UFO&#39;s in the sky, nor did I do any UFO sighting research about past sightings of them until these events occurred, and I am still seriously skeptical about UFO&#39;s reports, but the night I saw those events still has me thinking of what type of object it was that I saw traversing the night skies, and what was it that I saw motionlessly situated except for changing color pattern near the distant horizon?  Was it just a fluke incident of nature?  About a week after the incident, I looked at some star chart for that night.  All of the viewable planets were on the West side that night, and the only bright star viewable on the east side was suppose to be way down south.  I looked at the satellite charts between the hours I saw the glowing object, but I could not find any satellite that may had been traversing during those hours I saw the glowing object that instantly disappeared before my very own eyes.  I couldn&#39;t possibly be the only person who saw this object which simply vanished into nothing with the  moonlight brilliantly shining everywhere; there were just too many people on the fishing bridge that night.  Well, I guess I&#39;ll never know what I saw, and it almost a year later and still I can&#39;t find any answers to what I saw that night.  What I wrote is the best that I could describe of what I saw on the night of April 12, 2003.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
4/12/03 20:30|Pensacola|FL|Light|1 minute|I thought it may be a satellite, but now I don't know because of the way the light it emitted just simply turned off.|4/22/03|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/028/S28428.html|138|ndxe200304| I thought it may be a satellite, but now I don&#39;t know because of the way the light it emitted just simply turned off.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On Saturday night, April 12, 2003 between the hours of 8:30 PM and 9:00 PM, I was on the (Pensacola side) fishing bay bridge at pillar marker 44 just before the so called &#34;hump&#34;.  I was facing directly due East with the half to almost 3/4 moon brilliantly shining at an angle between 1 o&#39;clock and 2 o&#39;clock in the sky, and looking due south, the moon was brilliantly shining at an angle slightly beyond 12 o&#39;clock.  While looking directly due east, I noticed a large star like object between 22 degrees to 30 degrees above the eastern horizon, and the object appeared to be located near Navare or Fort Walton.  It was flickering like a star changing to different colors of red, green, and blue.  My first thoughts was UFO because the lights were changing in a timely color pattern.  I was wondering if I was the only person out of about a hundred people who were fishing on the bridge that night who may have seen what I saw, so I decided to briefly of less than one second to shined my flood spot light directly towards the object so people might notice the flood beam and gazes towards the direction I saw the object in the sky.  The floodlight&#39;s beam could not reach the object I saw in the sky.  Since the object didn&#39;t move and it appeared to be stationary, I decided that the object I was seeing was just a large star or planet since some stars or planets do flicker and shine similar in ways of the object I saw.  But the object just described is not the main reason why I wrote this account.  It is what happened briefly two to three minutes after shining the flood light at the object (star).  Still facing directly east, I notice another object coming directly from either the north or northeast at an angle of 45 degrees above the eastern horizon heading south.  This object appeared to be only 3 miles or less away from my position or 1/8 the distant from the fishing bridge to the midway bridge.  This object was also moving at the speed of a satellite and as bright as of the brightest of all satellites, bu! t this object seem very low in orbit for I seen satellite traversing the skies in the past.  But still this is not the main reason why I wrote this account.  What really caught my attention was the fact while I was watching what I thought was a satellite traversing the sky, the object&#39;s (satellite?) light just turned off like somebody flick the light switch to the off position once it past my two o&#39;clock angle.  The object&#39;s light just didn&#39;t dim and fade away like other satellites I seen in my past.  Just about 1 mile before entering Gulf Breeze area, this object just instantly stopped shining its lights.  I seen meteorite&#39;s in my past, and those meteorites had always  left behind what I call a trailing light.  The second object I saw didn&#39;t have this trailing light for like I said, it originally look like a satellite.  What occurred about 5 to 10 minutes after that event seems interesting too.  I saw three aircraft in the sky.  One aircraft was a passenger airliner landing at Pensacola&#39;s airport which seem to have zillions of lights on it.  The other two aircraft might have been military, and I know they were aircrafts because they had their identification lights flicking off and on.  Those two other aircrafts were zigzagging all over the skies as thou searching for something, but they never ventured into the area where I saw that second object where it just disappear in a blink of an eye after viewing it for at least 30 second to a minute.  Is it possible for satellites just to blink out or what I saw that night was truly a UFO cloaked as a satellite?  I don&#39;t look for UFO&#39;s, and I am somewhat skeptical about UFO&#39;s and of most reports of them, but the night I saw this event got me somewhat thinking of what type of object it was that I saw traversing the night skies.  Was it just a fluke incident of nature?  I guess I&#39;ll never know, and what I wrote is exactly what I saw on the night of April 12, 2003.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I had just passed over the I-55 overpass when I noticed in front of me and at approximately 25 degrees above the horizon a very intense light, from an arc welder, with a very blinding deep blue color.  I pulled over on to the side of road and was almost hit by a car approaching me from the rear. The object zig-zagged in a &#34;z&#34; pattern and stopped, intense light stopped but was replaced by a less intense silver-gray giving way to the outline of a disk shaped object.  This state of dull gray lasted 3-4 minutes.  The Object just hovered but wobbled in placed until it became stationary.  About a minute later it began to move north and vanished.

I noticed a glow on the ground near a fence. It was two and a half feet wide and about five feet long. It looked about three inches deep, it was a foggy white with blue crystal looking chips in it. I could see the formation of the ground but not the color of the dirt. I also noticed three other glowing areas about twelve by twelve inch squares spaced in a zig zag formation about three feet apart. They also had the same glowing effect. At first I thought it was the light from the moon or a street light in the front yard but as I looked at it, I realized the moon was covered by the clouds and the light couldn&#39;t reach the rear yard. The light was illuminating from the ground not on it. As I realized that this was an unusual sighting I spoke out loud to my self and said &#34;What the f--- is that?&#34; just after I spoke those words the illuminations disappeared in sequence. First the large rectangle than one by one the square illuminations followed. I thought it heard me. I was spooked. I awoke my children to look out the window and the illuminations had not returned. The next day I checked the area but everything looked undisturbed. Has anyone seen anything like this?<n>

One of the lights was heading to the northeast, which was in the direction towards Kitwanga, B.C. from there location and the other in the opposite direction. The &#34;lights&#34; were at a very high level and lasted for approx: a second or two. The color of the lights were reported as being a silver/white.

We frequently see things in the sky around our home, so we stopped and watched it as we drove into the driveway.  It appeared as a bright star (larger than other stars in the sky), and it was emitting multicolored bursts of light (blue, green, red, and yellow).  It also appeared to be rotating.  We decided to go inside and get the binoculars and the digital camcorder.  The binoculars were no good, but the camcorder proved to be amazing.  I was able to zoom in on the object to get a better view.  Originally, it appeared as a bright light with a pulsating pink light in the center which would occasionally emit bursts of light in various directions.  For some reason, I got the idea to turn on the &#34;nightshot&#34; on the camera (which allows you to see in the dark).  When I did, the bright light changed, and I could see more detail.  It appeared as a rotating disk at first, and then it morphed into what appeard to be a jack (like you would see in a game of ball and jacks).  After morphing into the jack, the arms of the jack came together to make a sphere.  I got some very vivid video of the image<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We will invite the witness to forward some stills from the video, but we are suspicious that the witnesses may have been looking at the star, Sirius.

He said to me that he had his first UFO sighting the other night. There were four witnesses to this sighting. On April 11, 2003 at 8:00 p.m., which was a Friday evening 4 witnesses were just west of Houston in an area called the Houston Estates. There are a number of homes in the area. One of the witnesses saw something funny and told everyone else to look.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Looking south towards the Morice River, from the Houston Estates they noticed the strangest set of lights. It was very low in altitude, and sitting above the Morice Valley Road. I was told the only  thing which could be seen on it were the three colored lights. The witness said it was as if the object was rotating, as the lights kept changing position. The color of the lights were, yellow, blue and red. The strange thing about this sighting is that I was told that the object was witnessed for approx: 10 minutes. Also if one would picture someone making a drawing of a Christmas Tree, (just a simple sketch) this would have been how this object moved. So starting say from the top of a tree, it zipped down and out to it&#39;s left, then moved quickly straight back in. ( say  towards the trunk of the tree). Then dropped a bit and continued doing this until in was noted to have dropped a good distance in height. He told me whatever it was moved extremely fast, then would come to a complete stop. Then once again continuing to move at a high rate of speed making the same maneuvers over and over again. The object would have been approx: 2 miles away from the peoples location. Binoculars were brought out so they could get a better look at it,  I was told all that could be seen was the lights, no shape or body to the object. The object/lights vanished instantly after the 10 minutes of viewing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Anyway how, this is a raw report and I am in the works of contacting the other three witnesses to gather more information on this sighting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We express our gratitude to Brian Vike, Director of the Houston, British Columbia, Canada UFO Research organization, for sharing this report.

The next day I went to the same location and videotaped another object. There was also another person with me viewing the object. I was alittle startled to see another object in the sky so when I took my eyes away to place them on the viewfinder of the camera I had difficultly relocating it. My friend was talking to me with his back to the object. I told him to look around and tell me if he sees what I was seeing. He said he did. We were looking west, towards the Pacific Ocean. I was about in the same vicinity as the one I had seen yesterday, but it looked very differant. It was a white cylindrical object in straight horizontal flight. I was traveling very slowly. We followed it for about 2 minutes until it went behind a dark cloud. I estimated the object to be about 5000 feet altitude and possibly 25-30 miles away. I estimate the distance because I can see Cucamonga Peak to the north, which is about 24 miles away. To the left I have a range of mountains which house some communication towers and I found that the peak they are situated on are about 5600 feet in altitude. When I reviewed my videotape,I didn&#39;t see the object which my friend and I were seeing. I did have the audio with descriptions of the sighting being heard. I was disappointed not having captured the object. However I reviewed the tape just recently and I was surprised to notice the object was captured for a brief moment. I see a bright object flash and then quickly dart upward and stop. This was the craft I had seen before it initiated a straight horizontal flight pattern. At this point the sighting was documented by audio means. I had seen two objects on the 10th and the 11th, at the same location, at approxiamately 7:15PM. I went back to the same location on several occasions since then, but have not seen anything unfamiliar in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The dock is on the Loxahatchee River, not very far from the Atlantic Ocean at Hobe Sound, FL. The object was perhaps 8-10 degrees above the horizon, or not quite twice as high as the tree level. It moved from left to right within the field of the camera, covering about 1/2 the (camera) field of view within the approximately five seconds between exposures. The object appears fairly large by comparison to trees and river, although I can&#39;t estimate it actual size.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object looks to be a vertically oriented flattened triangular shape that is a cloud-like white color on the broadest/nearest side and somewhat of a dark rust color along the thinner/further edge. The sky conditions were a bright overcast. The weather was calm and unseasonably cool. Nothing unusual was noted at the time aside from my having had prior reservations about staying at this particular campground (it&#39;s really a very nice state park). Only two or three other people were present in the area at the time, not withstanding my family of four.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The photographs were taken during daylight using a Canon T50 35mm SLR, 50mm 1:1.8 lens and Fugicolor Superia X-TRA 400 ASA film.

I grabbed my digital camera to record this strange behaving object. Unfortunately I only got about 3 seconds on film, due to my aged camera. I have never seen anything moving so fast nor hovering at such precision, we are to this day puzzled over what we saw. It was an amazing sight! I uploaded the movie at my personal homepage: http://medlem.spray.se/downloathe/UFO.avi<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We have viewed the video clip, which shows a disc-shaped object hovering over a populated shoreline, then suddenly banking toward the camera and accelerating very rapidly to the left.  The rocking of the boat, from which the video apparently was taken, helps provide some reference for the acceleration of the object.  PD))<n>

While sitting on my back porch watching clouds and airport traffic I noticed an egg/orb heading north to south very slowly at about 10,000 feet.  At one point it seemed to briefly pause and continue.  It was shiny and hard to see without my polarized glasses.  I had my camcorder with me and I got a little footage of it but I couldn&#39;t see it in the viewfinder, only on playback could I see it and the few seconds was poor but there. The clouds at that time were moving west to east.  I&#39;ll keep watching....<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Once we knew it wasnt a plane we ran up towards it.As we got closer it moved so it was facing directly towards us. Then it hovered left and righ between a cut in the houses. There was a main road next to the houses so we had to stand in the road to see it. After about 40 seconds in total it completly disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We will attempt to have this student have his friend submit a report, as well.  PD))<n>

Time 1:57 am. from over the oaker mountains west of Salt Lake city. Now the best way to explain this sighting is a streak of smoke just appearing from over the Oaker Mountains. I did not get a look at the object because the object was gone as I  looked at the flash, ( I can&#39;t think of anything to compare it to, the smoke trail from the object was just there, like lightning ). ( I can not say if it was smoke or water vaper from the object heating the water in the air much like a cloud. ) The object that made the streak caught my attention, it was much like a camera flash in motion. I pulled my car over and took video of the streak in the sky.  when I got home I went into my back yard and took more video of the streak of smoke. At this time the streak had dissipated. There was no Airplane or Jets in the sky making a contrail.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We may post the graphic of the event, provided by the witness.  We do know that there is a blue-green laser, which is used by a physics/atmospheric science department in this area, but the witness asserts that such a device would not appear to explain what he witnessed.

There were approximately 9 total lights in a triangular formation or &#34;V&#34; shape with another semi triangular row behing the front row of lights. The second row of lights appeared to move about slightly but stayed in a gereral formation with the front row. The lights moved overhead just above the lower lying thin layer of clouds with no sound whatsoever. I looked for light tracer beams from below to see if it was possible beams of light from the ground but there was no trace. These lights appeared to be relatively low and just above the lowest stata of cold-front clouds in the night sky and moving in the opposite direction of the clouds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous.

4/10/03 21:00|Peru|IN|Circle|3 min|Orange/amber globes appeared to come out from behind an object till fully round ,very bright a mist surounded the lights.|5/10/04|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/036/S36795.html|159|ndxe200304| Orange/amber globes appeared to come out from behind an object till fully round ,very bright a mist surounded the lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am reporting this do to the current rash of sightings in north central Indiana from 4/8/04 thru early May I looked back thru the history files on your system and found the same type of sightings frequently in Indiana dating back to 1953. My Family and I were returning from my inlaws house at around 9:00p.m. traveling on 24 west toward Peru as we  aproached town I noticed the sky seemed to iluminate with no apparent light source present, then a bright orange/amber light slowly appeared as if it were coming out from behind something until it was a full round circle. at the time I thought it was coming out from behind a cloud. My wife asked &#34;are you seeing that!&#34; I replied yyeeaa then like the first a second amber spere slowly appeared exactly like the first as if it were coming out from behind something. this was happening directly in front of us as we traveled down the high way the first globe slowly went away in the exact way it appeared then the second. at this point we approached the bottom of the hill and turned into the median then a third amber globe apeared exactly as before, and fade exactly as before I estimate these to have been mabe a half mile away from our location and quite large, I&#39;d guess from the distance mabe 10 ft across unless the globes were closer to us than I am estimating each globe seemed to stay lit for mabe 10 to 15 seconds. I pulled over and got out to see if any others would light and to my suprise I could see all the stars, there were no clouds to explain the &#34;ducking out from behind&#34; way in which they apeared and disapeared. My wife was nervous and wanted me back in the car so we went on into town. An intresting side note to this, I picked up a pizza the next day and mentioned what I saw to the girl working behind the counter she told me she wittnesed the same thing a couple years previous while sitting outside her job eating her lunch, also a co-worker of mine wittnessed the same thing on 9/10/01 the day before 9/11 thats how she remebered the date this w! as in Ne w Waverly. If I ran into two people within 2 days who had seen the same thing I saw ,at diffrent times I can only guess and asume this must be happening very frequently I would be intrested in your investigation and best answers to this I do not believe as some have sugested to me that this is military exercises and flares I don&#39;t believe a flare would apear as a perfectly round amber light in the sky. I saw no aircraft in the area, have your people done any checking in on this? has the local Indiana chapter checked with Grissom radar or anything? please post some informaion on the progress of your investigation in Northern Miami county and Rochester. More information can be found on these sightings from the Rochester Cintenal.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was contrasted against some dark clouds. It was hovering to the east at about 10 o&#39;clock.It was saucer shaped with domes on the top and on the bottom. The front of the object was pointing downward. The object started to slowly propel from the left to the right. At times it would stop and just hover. I viewed the object for about 1 minute 40 seconds. It went behind a tree, and the time it took for me to get to a position to get a view of the object, it was gone. I had my video camera with me and I was able to capture the whole duration of the sighting. I am a nurse caring for an invalid in a wheel chair. I was out with the patient taking him for a &#34;walk&#34;. I have never carried a video camera to work but did on this day because the day before I had seen many contrails in the sky and I wanted to video tape any if they were like they were yesterday. The object I saw was in the same location that the many contrails were the day before. Also I will mention that the wind gained in force during the sighting and it became cold quickly. About 30 minutes after the sighting, the winds died down and it seemed to become slightly warmer.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was approximately 6:15PM/PST and I was listening to news radio and happened to see a rather large silver, cigar-shaped UFO hanging a bit low in the sky ahead, probably over the Santa Monica beach shoreline.  I was not too far from my exit and this luminous object was so present and transfixing that I could hardly keep my eyes on the road.  It was VERY visible, just hanging in the sky and there was no cloud/fog cover. I am not in the habit of looking for UFO&#39;s on my drive home from a busy work day, so seeing this strange object was really a surprise (I found out later, after the sighting, that UFO&#39;s have been known to be cigar-shaped).  The object hung in the sky for about 10-15 minutes and then simply disappeared-out of sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

I watched it until the trees obsctructed my view.  There were no visible lights, other than the initial flash that attracted my attention. Once I reached my destination (on the same road), I watched the general area for about 5 minutes, but there was no further sign of the object.  But an airplane did fly near the same location about 5 minutes after my sighting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness is a member of law enforcement.  PD))<n>

They were about 1000 feet down river from me.  I jumped up and went to the sliding glass doors and opened them. As the craft traveled the 1,000 feet from where I first spotted it to in front of the house, it descended from tree top level to about 50 feet above the river. When it got right in front of me, the lights disappeared.   There was no sound and I couldn&#39;t tell if the craft went under water or just turned the lights off and flew off.   The length of the craft was about 80 feet, with one light at the front, one in the middle and one at the end.  It was a long, tube or cigar shaped craft.  It was too dark to tell if there were any wings or other portions protruding from it.  A companion heard a helicopter flying overhead about an hour later, which is unusual, since we are in a very remote area.  This is my first UFO sighting and I am a middle aged professional that is not easliy taken by any type of UFO phenomena.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
4/8/03 12:05|Tempe|AZ|Cylinder|1 minute or so|Noontime sighting on a sunny, cloudless day of a long, brightly glaring craft that disappears from view.|4/22/03|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/028/S28363.html|173|ndxe200304| Noontime sighting on a sunny, cloudless day of a long, brightly glaring craft that disappears from view.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was meeting my sister for lunch at 12:15 PM.  I was driving south on S. Hardy Drive towards Baseline.  The day was sunny, the sky was blue, and there was no haze or clouds in the sky. Just as I was coming up to the Hwy 60 overpass I glanced up and saw what I first thought was a jet airplane.  It was right above the center of my steering wheel moving slowly to the right within the frame of my windshield.  Unfortunately, the &#34;sighting&#34; didn&#39;t appear out of the ordinary at first and occurred so quickly that I didn&#39;t think to try and take a measurement.  However, from my position in the driver&#39;s seat, I would estimate that if I pointed my thumb up, with my arm straight out in front resting on the steering wheel, the aircraft would have been as wide as my thumb.  As I continued to drive, I switched my gaze back &amp; forth being mindful of the road while checking out the object as well.  It appeared to be elongated like a passenger jet would be, but I couldn&#39;t make out the specific features due to the bright, silvery glint that was reflecting off of it.  My first thought was that the sun was reflecting off the aircraft at just the right angle for it to create such a glare.  As I continued to look up at it I noticed that the glare began to diminish, and along with it, the aircraft slowly faded from view.  Completely.  I kind of shook my head and thought if the glare slowly faded because the angle had changed due to the forward movement of the aircraft, shouldn&#39;t I have had a clearer view of it rather than no view of it?  I searched the sky briefly in the direction it had been flying, but there was nothing there.  Then from the view on the right side of my windshield, traveling to the left, I could see the narrow contrail of another jet (but not the jet itself) high in the sky, as one normally sees contrails when a jet flys high over a city.  (30,000 feet perhaps?)  At that point I realized that the craft I first saw must have been flying much lower because I could definitely see that it was some! type of aircraft, long and shining brightly, however it did not have a contrail…and it dissolved away from view.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

A d|7/16/03|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/029/S29458.html|174|ndxe200304| Following is the result of 3 Iowa MUFON members&#39; investigation of an incident reported to NUFORC on: 4/9/2003 3:04:06 PM 15:04.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A daughter and her mother (ages 38 and 58) were driving home to Dubuque, Iowa from a concert in Cedar Rapids, Iowa after midnight on Tuesday April 8, 2003, when a golden-bronze light descended to the right front of their car (the daughter was driving, with the mother in the passenger&#39;s seat) and passed through, and perhaps alongside their car.  (Investigator&#39;s note:  It is important here to note the weather conditions:  Light snow; OVERCAST WITH 1100 FOOT CLOUD BASE; 26 Degrees Fahrenheit; Wind NE 12 mph.)  As the light passed through the car, both witnesses felt unusual physical sensation.  The driver (daughter) felt a burning, tingling sensation along her right side - and felt as if the light, which was a bit to her right, had affected mainly that part of her body, and stated that her &#34;insides&#34; felt as if they were being pulled to the right as the light passed through.  The mother also felt physical sensation which, because of the medication, Oxycodone, which she&#39;d taken an hour before the incident for a condition called neurofibromatosis, she thinks she should not have been able to feel.  The mother saw the light first as it began descending toward the car, with the daughter then able to perceive it as it appeared in front of the car and moved through (and perhaps along the right side) of the car.  (Keeping in mind the 1100 foot cloud base, we at least know that the light would have been below 1100 feet when the mother first saw it descending.)  To the witnesses, the duration of the sighting and passage of the light seemed like no more than perhaps 5 seconds.  The daughter/driver remembers her head whipping to her right briefly as the light passed through.  The next thing she knew she was staring straight ahead at the road with her hands tightly gripping the steering wheel, with the words, &#34;Focus-focus-focus-focus-focus&#34; going through her mind as the car moved along at 55 miles per hour.  She immediately looked at the car clock and saw that it was 1:36 a.m., although neither witness is aware of the ti! me when the incident began, and so the question of the length of the incident goes unanswered.  At no time did the witnesses see a craft, but both of them perceived some kind of energy they find it difficult to describe.  The mother sketches a series of horizontal and vertical marks within the light, and the daughter mentions a kind of swirling, fluid black mist in the light.  Oddly, it was later found that a gold T-shirt purchased at the concert, which had been inside the mother&#39;s bag in the front seat prior to the incident, was now, following the incident, on the floor in the back seat.  Physical effects on the daughter/driver continued to manifest, i.e.: for 3 days her husband noticed the hair on her right arm would &#34;stand up,&#34; with the hair on her left arm lying down normally.  She also had the sensation of heat on the right side of her body, at the same time she felt normal temperature on the left side of her body.  When the daughter related the incident to a friend from out of state, her friend advised her to check her body for marks, and she and her husband noted a puncture mark about an inch below her navel.   Whether this is related to the incident, of course, is not definitely known, but the witness says she doesn&#39;t know how it got there.  About 10 days after the incident, the daughter/driver&#39;s lymph nodes began to swell (Whether this is at all related to the incident is not known; it is simply something to take note of).  The daughter/driver witness has now been to the doctor several times, with blood tests being taken, and nothing found amiss.  The swelling persisted at high level for about 6 weeks, then began to decrease somewhat, although there is at this writing (June 29, 2003) still some swelling of the nodes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After the light had disappeared, mother and daughter say that there remained a golden glow on the clouds as they made their way on the rural highway toward Dubuque, Iowa.  When they came to the Dubuque airport some 25 miles further on down the highway, they noted that the airport lights could not have been the golden light they&#39;d seen because the airport lights were definitely white instead of gold.  Iowa MUFON personnel continue to maintain frequent telephone contact with the daughter witness as she continues to have her health assessed by doctors in her area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We express our gratitude to Iowa MUFON State Director, Beverly Trout, for requesting the case for follow-up, and for submitting the report to NUFORC.

I stopped the car and we all got out, the light came with in  5 feet from us, and was low to the ground.  When ever we turned on a flash light it came toward it.  It was not real big but maybe as big as the road was wide, and it glowed but did not shine any light on the ground.  I wanted to go, i was very frightened. we all got in the car and drove off fast, it kept up with us easily, then when we were about to the paved road it went left up in the sky and was gone.  I now believe in U.F.O&#39;s it was so close to me i could of reached out and touched it.

My mom, my two brothers and one sister and I were driving along in our van. I was watching an airplane way up high in the sky making a trail of exhaust. It went behind a cloud and the trail disappeared. It came out again and the trail started forming again. Then a little white dot in the sky caught my attention. At first I didn’t think much about it until I saw how fast it was going. It was going faster then the airplane and was lower to the horizon, too. It was pretty far behind the airplane, so I don&#39;t know if it was chasing it or not. It looked like it was spinning. It was kind of a shiny white, and was an oval disk shape. I couldn&#39;t tell if it made a sound or not because the van was making to much noise to hear. We were driving east and I was looking out the window north. It was about three miles east of Franklin, Tennessee. I watched it for about 6 or 7 seconds before it disappeared behind a cloud.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with this witness and he sounded to us to be quite credible.  PD))<n>

4/6/03 23:59|Saint James|MN|Formation|at least 30 minutes|I saw a cluster (7 min.) of tiny lights stationery in the sky like stars with shimmering lights for at least a half hour.|4/22/03|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/028/S28342.html|182|ndxe200304| I saw a cluster (7 min.) of tiny lights stationery in the sky like stars with shimmering lights for at least a half hour.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I looked out my window as I was in bed and noticed a cluster of tiny lights in the sky. I thought at first that it was an airplane but the cluster didn&#39;t move. I watched diligently for about a half hour before falling asleep. The lights shimmered slightly and stayed in the irregular shaped formation. At 2:30 A.M. I awoke and checked the area in the sky. The cluster had disappeared. This was a very clear night I have seen reflections from satellites and man made objects in space but this did not appear like those. I couldn&#39;t estimate a distance but it looked like tiny stars. The shimmering lights reminded me of looking through an astronimic telescope and seeing the atmospheric shimmering effect. I am a retired Industrial Designer, of sound mind, and always interested in details. This is the only sighting I have witnessed of a supposed anomaly in space.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I saw what I ridiculously thought was a flock of geese flying in perfect formation but quickly realized that was not possible as it was night and the &#34;geese&#34; were actually white lights in a V or boomerang formation. There were maybe 25 lights in rows, like pave&#39; diamonds. (Possibly four rows.) The lights were white, no color, not pulsing or twinkling and no beams coming from them. They did not seem to be part of a large object and there was no discernible structure behind them. There is a huge supermarket below this spot and a lot of reflected light coming up in the sky and I think I could have seen a solid structure around it. The lights did not move around but stayed in perfect formation, completely silent.  They appeared to be about 45 degrees above the horizon, just above this palm tree, which is about 80 feet tall. I can&#39;t estimate speed. It didn&#39;t zoom across the sky but made stately progress, possibly a little faster than an airplane. It then disappeared behind another very tall tree and I moved to be able to catch it as it would pass from behind the tree. But it disappeared and was not seen again. It did not move upward or laterally. It just disappeared. I am a 65 year-old college-educated male and have always been skeptical about these sightings.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I saw it in Langdon, Alberta.  (Langdon is a really small town that&#39;s about 15 minutes out of Calgary) I looked out the window and all of a sudden I saw this saucer shaped object in the sky.  It had red lights all around the outside of it like a border.  I watched it just hover in the sky for about 3 minutes.  Then the whole sky lit up red and the object disapeared.  I continued to look out the window to see if it would come back but it didn&#39;t.  I know that what I saw was not an airplane, helicopter, etc.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The object moved quickly then slowly and then appeared  to stop and made  short movements then proceeded at a 90 degree and from the original movement at a slow spedd the appeared to go higher out of my visual range.  A passing commercial aircraft was passing  heading north and the object appeared  well above that. This time frame was about 15 20 mins  at which time I observed  a similar object approach from the  south and also stopped  and the made  a 90 degree turn and head east as did the first object slowly  then out of visual range.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The camera was fixed on an area of the city not showing anything in particular when suddenly an object flew through the frame. I recognized it and was hoping it would come back again and it did. It was about 8 inches long, silver and thin with 2 small winglets at each end. It appeared to be flexible. It flew in a hap hazard pattern like a fly for a few seconds and then it was gone. I forget the name these are called but it reminded of a drill bit. I was pretty excited as this was my first and only ufo siting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have seen photos of them before and will include one similar to what I saw.

The time I recorded reflects that change. I recently purchased new binoculars (20X60) and that day had found a tripod adapter for them. A few minutes prior, I had finished focusing the binoculars on one of the brightest stars. I took a break for a few minutes to let my eyes adjust after having been looking at the brightness. After that, I had spent a while enjoying the magnification power of the binoculars, realizing how much of the night sky I&#39;d been missing before. I would find an area of the sky to view, lock the tripod and binoculars into place, view for a while, then move to a different spot, and do the same thing. Once while doing this, after locking into place, I looked through the binoculars and saw that three &#34;stars&#34; were moving horizontally, simultaneously, across the viewing field. After they moved out of view I looked without the binoculars and realized they were quite visible with the naked eyes. To get a closer look, I unlocked the binoculars so that they remained on the tripod, but I was able to pan across the sky while looking through them. I realized then, that I could actually see a dark silhouette of a triangular craft. I watched it moving for about three minutes until the silhouette began to be difficult to discern, then the movement stopped. It was then that I noticed the outline of a HUGE circle. Like the triangle, the darker, black image was visible (only through the binoculars) against the background of an already pretty dark night sky. Without binoculars, the perimeter of the object was indicated by a circular (nonmoving) formation of lights, with one very bright light in the center and an average star-like intensity light down and left of the center light. Also visible without binoculars, was a circle of lights inside the larger circle. The front light of the triangle seemed to be a part of that circle, while the two rear lights of the triangle made up two of the ten lights of the perimeter of the circle. It was as if the tri! angle had moved into the pie shape, filling in one of the wedges. As I stood there, trying to make sense of it all, clouds moved in, obscuring all the stars.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I type this I feel like readers will find it laughable, but I swear I&#39;m not crazy!

We have checked the &lt;www.heavens-above.com&gt; website, and there are no bright satellites that were visible over Isle of Palms at the time, and on the date, indicated.

I was outside standing on my 2cnd floor apartment balcony smoke a ciggarete.  When an Extremely large craft no more then 1000 ft away from me flew over a shopping center at around an altitude of about 600+ ft.  I must have watched it sit there and hover for a good 15 minutes give or take a few minutes.  imagine a b2 stealth bomber, aka flying wing.  this thing had to be about 3 or 4 times larger than that, and the thing that confused the most, is no noise, none what so ever.  The only way I could tell that it was the same shape as the B2 stealth bomber, was due to the reflection of the light on the bottom of the craft.  as before it hoverd for about 15 minutes over a shopping center then it left southbound at a slow rate of speed and again very quiet.  I know no information about this type of aircraft that the military would be working on. Or anything civilian at that fact.  My video camera at the time worked perfectly.  I had a full battery at the time, and when i went to record it, the video camera would not turn on.  I tried to call neighbor at the time, and phone lost all cell phone signal.

It was during the fist part of the month and about in the middle of the week.Upon going outside the kids said there was a dragoon in the sky,(their native americans) anyway I looked up and sure as shit there were several silver disc shaped things in the air. It was a very bright afternoon and the sun reflected off of them and they were silver.They formed some weird shape in a formation like pattern.The kids said it looked like a dragon.I did not put it together.We watched these things almost to the point of like they were supposed to be there.Accepted , is the only thing that comes to mind. One of them came over us and just stayed there and it looked like flames were shooting out to the west of the craft and these things were oriented to the South.Our eyes began to see dots from staring at them for so long we had to quit looking and take a eye break. I did not have any portable optics to enhance the viewing so we were screwed from a detailed look.Finally the one that hovered over slowly backed up until it was gone.My 73 yo mom even saw the one shoot flames out the side.And the others simply vanished from view before we even noticed. We watched for about a half an hour.I or anyone else was scared it was almost likethey belonged there some how, I don&#39;t know. This was during the start up phase of the war in Iraq that is why I was listening to my shortwave radio.Sorry about the date no body can remember the exact day or date.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

Living near Vandenberg AFB, this was not abnormal, but the loudness was.  I looked up and saw what appeared to be two  low and fast flying f-16&#39;s in pursuit of a small cigar-shaped object that was ahead of them by about 500 feet.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I watched as they continued to chase the object until they went over the mountains heading in the direction of Santa Ynez and out of sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I saw two dots heading in out direction very rapidly and as I concentrated on focusing on them I saw this little dot in front of them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first I thought maybe it was just vulture or some other raptor flying in the foreground, but as I observed, I saw that this dot was staying in sync with the two bigger dots as they were closing on our location.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then within just about 15 seconds we (wife/I) saw two military jets (black long noses, w/green camo(/f-16/f-111?)) enclosing on this cigar shaped object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They nearly flew just couple 100 ft above the hill we were just on. They were so close that the sound was deafening.<n> <n><n> <n><n> One jet tried to come up on the ufo and even banked a little bit to maybe get a better look of the ufo.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The ufo then seemed to really move quickly, and it started to pull away from the jets.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My wife and I excitedly grabbed the kids and ran up the path to top of mtn we had just climbed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I got to the top I could just see the two jets rapidly heading, I guess east over the mtn range.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My wife says she saw a glimpse of a silver shiny color on the underside of the ufo.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I don&#39;t recall seeing color; I just saw what look liked a dark line or cigar shaped object just a little shorter than the jet’s noses.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I served in the u.s.a.f  for 4yrs as a security police and never have ever seen anything like this before with military jets flying so low over semi-populated area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Vandenberg AFB is just down the road from Los Alamos, but does support fighter jet aircraft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> VAFB mainly deals with missle launches.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Interesting thing is later on in that month I would see these fighter jet kind of aircraft flying into VAFB.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Which is odd, because when I worked at VAFB, I rarely saw these kind of fighter jets, except a day or two before an air show.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My wife and I are not sure what we saw. I&#39;m a skeptical about aliens, but have not ruled out military experiments or other phenomenom.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

He told us to look up into the sky, the was a bright orange circular object flying in the left hand side of the sky. it was the color of fire. this thing wasn&#39;t flying like any plane or hellicopter i have ever seen, it was almost hovering, then it would move a bit, kind of like a real slow leaf. We reversed out of the parking lot, we wanted to get away from the buildings so that we could get a better look at this thing. as we were backing up it faded then dissapeared. We drove down the road next to the parking lot hoping to see something more. We drove all the way to the end of the  dead end road and turned around all of us staring at the sky. there were buildings on both sides of us but still we had a better view of the sky than just a few minutes before. So we drove slowley back  taword the main Street when all of a sudden  i see the ufo again, i could see it in between the  buildings as we were driving. So V the driver stops and backs up fast, We all see this thing again, he puts the car in park and we all jump out. The thing looked to me that it re-appeared a little more to the left of the sky, i was thinking that no plane could fly that far so quik then just stop and hover.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then the object slowley started flying towards the right hand side of the sky, all of us were trippen out. My friend V pulled out his phone and began calling a few friends. He was talking Loud and fast telling them &#34;Oh My God, Dude go outside and look at the sky, we are looking at a ufo right now&#34; I tryed to get ahold of anyone at my Parents house but nobody was Picking up there phones. So i  then called My girl Friend who lives  Four hours away from me, i told her what i was seeing, she could hear My friends in the background freaking out.<n> <n><n> <n><n> All of a sudden i noticed something falling from the ufo, i said to my friends &#34; oh my god! look, its dropping something&#34;,  It started dropping  big bright orange flame looking things from the bottom of it. It looked to me almost like Sparks from a camp fire but real big. it would drop 4 to 6 of these spark looking things at a time then stop for a second and then continue on dropping things, The Sparks were almost the same size as the ufo. I thought to myself &#34;would if its appart of the war going on right now?&#34; i started freaking myself out in my head. The Ufo kept flying and dropping things from it, all the way untill it got to the right hand side of the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> it then began to fade or dissapear, almost like it flew away so fast it just kinda faded, then a few short second past and it re- appeard, this time it wasnt as bright i dont think, i saw it out of the corner of my left eye, while my eyes were focused about two inches to the right, while i saw that by the corner of my eyes i was focused on another light that appeared, that new light looked just like a star just brighter, it dropped one white shimmering star looking thing, it shot toward the ground and then faded. It looked like one shiney strand of christmas tree tinsel.<n> <n><n> <n><n> that was the last we saw. We continued to the party, the party took place in the back yard of some guy i have never met. the were all drinking and standing around a home made pit fire. The color of the fire was the same color of the ufo  we had seen just a few minutes before. We told our story to people and they just laughed and said stuff like &#34;yea, right on&#34; and &#34; yea right&#34; but when they heard the story from one of us and then went to the other to hear the story.. i think they started to believ cause our storys were the same.<n> <n><n> <n><n> thats what happend last night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> sorry for all the bad spelling.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was reddish orange in color, and I want to say it was dim in appearance. It had almost a &#34;natural&#34; color to it, Like that of fire. In other words it didnt appear to be luminated by artificial light. Its would slow down and change directions like nothing I know of, except a helicopter but helicopters  are loud and there was no sound coming from this thing. I pulled over and it was gone. so we drove around looking for it because we thought a building or a tree could have blocked our view, when we see it appear again almost like it appeared out of knowhere. We got out of the car and observed the object and was heading in our direction, maybe about a mile north from us. I began calling family and friends but knowone could see it. I concluded from this that the object was much closer than we thought. And coiuldnt have been much bigger than an average jet. The object began dropping some sort of luminated debris over the city. The debris looked as if it was on fire or luminated as well but it appeared to go out before it hit the ground. But it was rythmically dropping debrit for the duration of at least a minute, every two seconds. This excited me! What was it dropping???? It was actually pretty scary too!! It went passed where we were and finally faded out into the sky like a campfire would go out. This object looked almost &#34;organic&#34;. It was very bizzare<n>

There was a visble blue streak which tailed the sphere.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Following this, the area of the sky where the object &#39;crashed&#39; towards was illuminated in a blue light for a good 2-3 seconds.  It could very well have been some type of meteor, but the fact that there was this blue light associated with the object and the illumination of the sky made the event quite strange.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Please keep in mind, though, that this event occured during a barrage of freezing rain, which hampered visibility.  I seem to only remember two or three other cars on the road at the time.<n>

The object was (we are going to quess was about 10,000 ft.) up in the cloud range. There were very large patches of blue sky and lots of clouds as well. Just above a large section of clouds my wife saw a large sphere (about the size of an eraser head held at arm&#39;s length). It was extreamly bright, she almost said it looked like a light but for some reason said that she though that it wasn&#39;t, like it was metalic. The object dove into the cloud range at a very high rate of speed. Much faster that anything she has seen in the sky before. We got out of the car and looked at the range of clouds for several more minutes, but nothing else happend. She also said that the object flew in an arc as it entered the cloud range and left no trail.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I don&#39;t know exactly what it was but i think it was aliens or ufo&#39;s or something because of the weird noises and also the flying things were hovering and only harriers can do this so i was thinking what can harriers be doing in Staplefield?! The lights were purple and green, I am really woried that they may abduct me or something. After seeing this i am thinking of giving up smoking weed!<n>

Now after listening to what the witness had was reporting, I started thinking back to 2002 when I received a similar report from Terrace, B.C.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Two witnesses, just about a 1/2 of a kilometer west of Terrace watched and extremely large object fly very low over the Skeena River. They said it was overcast that night when they saw this &#34;thing&#34;. What they reported seeing was a huge dark colored object in the shape of a cross. The witness I chatted with said the body of the object was certainly longer than, say the wing span. It moved very slowly, no sound what so ever coming from it and on the bottom of the object it looked as if there were panels of colored lights on these panels. These panels number some 6 in total. The witness also mentioned that they could not see how high, or  the thickness would have been to the body of this object. Just to dark, and with the colored lights being so bright on the bottom of it, it obscured the view to some degree. This sighting lasted approx: 8 to 9 seconds before they lost sight of it due to the tree line blocking their view. (HBCC UFO Note: I asked if he could give me an approx: size of this craft, he thought about it for a bit and said it might have been the size of a 737 jet airliner. I also asked if any of these colored lights on the object were flashing, he said no.  I don&#39;t know what to make of this one, but after going back reading a report from 2002 I received, it sounds like it may be close to what was reported to me last year. I haven&#39;t been able to talk to the second witness as of yet. I hope to, but no luck so far.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thank you to the witness for their report.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We express our gratitude to Brian Vike, Director of the Houston, British Columbia, Canada UFO Research organization, for sharing this report.

I THEN AGAIN THOUGHT MAYBEE THEY WERE ON TOP OF A TOWER OR POSSIBLY A HELICOPTER. THERE WAS NO SOUND COMING FROM THE OBJECT AND THE SMALLER LIGHT TOWER NEXT TO THE ROAD WAS ONLY 30 FEET OFF THE GROUND.

AS I SLOWLY APPROACHED THE BRIDGE THE OBJECT STILL STATIONARY DISAPEARED FROM MY SIGHT AS I WENT UNTO THE BRIDGE. I SLOWLY PRECEEDED OVER THE BRIDGE LOOKING IN MY MIRRORS AND OUT THE BACK WINDOW AND WHEN I GOT TO THE OTHER SIDE OF THE BRIDGE I STOPPED THE OBJECT HAD DISSAPEARED. I TOLD THE TOLL CLERK AND ASKED IF ANYONE HAD SEEN ANY WIERD LIGHTS OR ANYTHING SUSPICIOUS BUT SHE SAID NO. I HAVE BELIEVED IN U.F.O.&#39;S SINCE I WAS A YOUNG KID. I&#39;VE WATCHED NUMEROUS DOCUMENTARIES AND READ MANY MAGAZINES AND ARTICLES FROM THIS AND OTHER WEB SITES. I HAVE WITNESSED MANY OBJECTS IN THE SKY IN THE DAYTIME AND NIGHT BUT THEY HAVE ALWAYS BEEN IDENTIFIABLE. THIS OBJECT WAS NOT MOVING AND DIDN&#39;T MAKE ANY SOUNDS IT WAS JUST HOVERING I THE SAME SPOT AT THE SAME HEIGHT FOR THE DURATION OF MY RIDE HOME. I NEVER HAVE BEEN SCARED OF VISIBLE LIGHTS LIKE THIS BEFORE ESPECIALLY FOR ME TO PULL OVER CLOSE TO UNDERNEATH THE OBJECT AND GET A CLOSER LOOK. I&#39;M NOT SCARED OF M! UCH BUT THIS WAS A VERY TROUBLING FEELING I HAD WHEN I GOT CLOSE TO THE OBJECT. IF ANYONE (THERE WERE A COUPLE CARS AND FREIGHT TRUCKS GOING BY SLOWING DOWN TO TAKE A LOOK) HAS WITNESSED WHAT I SAW AND FREQUENT THIS WEB SITE PLEASE REPORT YOUR SIGHTING. I KNOW WHAT I SAW !!!!!<n>

The lights were on an object like I have never seen before in my life hovring in the sky. There was three bright lights with one light on each corner of what ever it was, making the shape of what appeared to look like a triangle. I pulled my vehicle over to the side of the road to observe it futher. I witnessed this for about 5 minutes the object had no sound what so ever and thought this to be very strange. I&#39;m also aware of a military base in the area and it could be possible that they were testing something. Did you receive any other reports like mine.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I was star gazing and looked  toward the Big Dipper when I saw what appeared to be a small cluster of meteors (shooting stars).  I was following these lights for about 10 seconds and realized that it could not be meteors when suddenly  to my amazement the UFO  appeared low overhead.   It was Triangular in shape with three large round lights in each corner of the craft were rounded.   I watched as it silently  glided across the sky for approximately 30 seconds as it headed South.  I believe that there was most like several crafts  that I saw enter our atmosphere however, I only viewed one close up.   Definitely no mistake about this, the craft was to low to mistake it for anything other than what it was a UFO.  I could not take my eyes off the one I was looking at.  The lights were not bright they appeared to be dimmed  so as not to draw attention although clearly visible and giving way to the shape of the craft.

As was described by the writer, A small cylinder shaped object {not a drone} moving all around the military aircraft with no visible propulsion. The writer also suggests that the object was in fact being escorted by the aircraft. This certainly sounds within the realms of possibility and perhaps is accurate.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object described by the author has shown up here on the central east coast of Australia.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It wasn&#39;t until I read the report, that the memory of my sighting was brought back.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It doesn&#39;t sound very excting, but here&#39;s what happened.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On the day{shown above} my 11 year old son was outside playing with the boy next door. His Mother was doing a bit of gardening at the front of her house. I was inside at the time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My son called out to me to take a look at a strange object in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was cylindrical in shape, looked to be 4 to 6 feet in length, maybe 2 feet wide, a greyish brown colour. We didn&#39;t notice any lights as it was broad daylight. The object was in totally clear view, with no clouds or shadows to impead or mistake what we were seeing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object may have been only 100 to 150 feet up, but it&#39;s a bit hard to say for sure.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The four of us stood scratching our heads as to what it might be. It moved slowly, about the speed of a hot air ballon on a realitively calm day. It&#39;s altitude did not seem to waver, nor did it&#39;s direction. East to west as if on a tightly pulled piece of string. If it were a loose bag or something, one would expect it to blow all over the place. We watched the object dissappear slowly to the west without a clue as to what it may have been. No lights. No haze, no windows, no fanfare at all. Just a very solid looking object in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was just beganing to show the signs of morning, but still dark enough to barely see the stars in the sky.  There were no clouds in the area when my co-worker looked at me and said there it is again.  When working thirds we manage to catch strange lights in the sky sometimes, but this was a bright light in the sky that was moving.  It then faded away at a relatively fast rate, much faster than say the blinking of a star in the sky.  It then completely dissapeared.  Then reappeared a few moments later, still moving through the sky.  It stayed bright for a short period of time, then faded away again.  I didn&#39;t see it after that.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  One of three submitted by same source.  PD))<n>

I then yelled for my fiancee to look because he was looking to his right out the window. By time he had noticed it was about 75 feet ahead of us but drifting down with the hillside. There was no noise and it was moving at a very slow steady pace just right above the tree lines.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was a very very dark night the shape was hard to depict but we got the impression of a triangle shaped craft that was inspecting our vehicle from above. Just as the sighting in Carlise Pa, this craft appeared to have it&#39;s lights dimmed but one light look as if it was slightly dimmer, it wasn&#39;t the frontal light, it was the back right light. We watched it roll over the hill line and follow the trees/road. As it rolled down the hillside was when we could depict it&#39;s shape a little better, A very dark flat triangular shaped craft with 3 lights on the very bottom indented within in the material and dim as if behind a VERY thick glass. It didn&#39;t give off the impression as light from a light bulb, but of a sort of light like a butane lighter.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was another car that was about 200 yards ahead of us but as I slowed down they got further ahead, I am assuming this car had seen it also because the craft had followed the road. I tried to keep up with it but when the trees down at the bottom of the hill got fuller we lost it in the night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

The objects appeared to be just above the horizon and were hovering over a casino parking lot, which is located south of South Mountain. Each object had three circular, amber-colored lights (one at each corner of the triangle). They were hovering in a wing to wing formation (their lights created a &#34;W&#34;)and seemed to span across a huge parking area. We observed this for approximately one minute. We turned away for 15-20 seconds, looked back and they were gone!<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.  PD))<n>

4/1/03 17:00|Asheboro|NC|Cylinder|2 to 3 min|Large, shiny, motionless cylinder.|10/31/03|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/032/S32527.html|220|ndxe200304| Large, shiny, motionless cylinder.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It has been sometime since I have seen this, but the thought of it has stayed with me.  Driving home from work (South on US220) I saw in the SSE sky what appeared to be a very large and shiny cylinder.  It appeared to be at a fairly high altitude (my best guess between 25,000 and 40,000 feet).  If my height guesstimate is correct then I would guess the length to be between 300 and 600 feet (this is based on what a commercial airliner looks like at cruising altitude).  The length to diameter ratio was probably between 4 and 5.  The sky was totally clear, and the sun was at a late afternoon angle so the object was reflecting greatly.  I&#39;m sure it wasn&#39;t some reflection/glare from my windshield, because the car was shaded by the trees along the road.  During the entire time I was watching, the object did not appear to move at all.  After I took my exit, which is basically a clover leaf, I was unable to find the object again.  My first thought when I saw it was that it was a sattelite reflecting the low angle sunlight, but it was just too large.  Like I said, this image has really stayed with me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

It suddenly grew dimmer as it moved away at a high rate of speed. About 30 seconds after I spoke to the person with me about what I had just seen, it appeared again and I was able to point it out in time for my co-worker to see it, just as it sped away growing dimmer. The dimming effect I&#39;m assuming was caused by it moving away at a rapid rate of speed.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Taking him out to a fenced in, lighted yard, on top of hill, standing there she noticed three bright lights at tree top level, behind the fence. After she averted her eyes to the dog, she looked back to see the lights were gone but lower down through the shurbs a &#34;eclipsed&#34; or half moon shape of orangish-reddish color was there.  Her eyes back to dog who seemed OK, and then to look up to see the three, headlight bright lights, about the width of a VW had risen and was very slowly, silently, moving toward her.  She called her dog who immediately obeyed (unusual) and went inside the house, woke her husband and they went to the deck and there was nothing there.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

To the east I saw bright lights.  I thought they were my neighbor&#39;s flood lights but realized they were too high.  I thought it was the moon coming up but at 2 AM the moon would have been more to the west.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It looked like this vehicle was stopped about 1/4 mile down the hill at tree top level.  As I watched, staying at tree top level, it slowly made it&#39;s way up the hill towards my house.  I thought it was a helicopter but I did not hear any noise.  The vehicle looked like a &#34;flying car&#34; with three huge bright white light headlights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was very close to my house and I was getting uneasy.  I went up the stairs to wake my husband to see this flying vehicle.  About one minute went by and when we went out to look again the vehicle was no where to be seen.  At the speed it was traveling it should still have been in the area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with the witness, and we found her to be exceptionally eloquent, and seemingly quite credible.  The case was forwarded to MUFON/Massachusetts, and is currently under investigation.  Please see graphic illustration of the object on the NUFORC homepage.  PD))<n>

I first thought it to be a shooting star, but realized it was too heavy, appeared about 5000 feet in height, traveled about 3 to 5 miles, an estimate. It went into a cloud and lite the cloud up. That justified the approximate height. Rough calculations indicate the streak was moving about 12,000 to 15,000 miles an hour,with no concern about hitting anything. Has anybody seen a similiar object?<n>

Me and my Sergeant were tasked with escorting the convoy of our armored vehicles from the port in Kuwait to our Camp along the border.  One night, sometime between 1 Apr 03 and 5 Apr 03, I was driving our Humvee across the desert and i saw in the sky what looked like an eye opening then closing.  It was a reddish orange light. Then I saw it open and close on another section of the sky.  Then I saw it open and close on another section of the sky.  That was the end for that night.  I saw the same light on two other occasions while in Iraq.  The lights behaved in a similar manner.  I am not sure if it was just some military aircraft, but I never heard any sound from them, and I have never seen anything like it before.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.
