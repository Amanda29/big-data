At first, i thought maybe it was scuba divers or something, but it was just sitting there, not like someone was swimming around. It seemed strange, and everything around us seemed still, no other people around. After watching it and wondering aloud to each other about what the light could be, it just blinked out or something and was gone. We looked around a bit but never saw anybody climb out of the water or anything, and eventually got back in our car and left. My wife says she has never seen anything weird like this before or since. It kind of spooked her... and later, her youngest sister (aorund 20 yrs. old) told us she&#39;d had a dream about my wife and i walking by some water somewhere and there was a ufo involved somehow, which adds an extra wrinkle to the story i reckon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date may be approximate.

How do I know, both of my children were still in school. It happened one night in late September (date is approximate ) after 10:30 pm. The kids had gone to bed and the evening news was over. I can&#39;t get this sighting out of my head and since we did not have the internet at that time, I am reporting it now. My husband and I got into the habit of going out after the news to watch the sky. He had studied some astronomy in college and we both liked looking at the stars. The kids had gone to bed so, we went out to the back yard (away from the street lights) to watch the stars. We were looking to the west and about 20 to 25 degrees off the horizon, I noticed a light blue very bright light. It was about the size of a pencil eraser held at arm&#39;s length. I pointed it out to him since it was so different from the stars we were observing. We watched it for about 10 to 15 minutes. It just sat there, no movement. I got cold as the night was chilly and decided to go in and get a coat, I wanted to get the binoculars also. I came out with the bincoulars and looked at the object. It was still in the same place. As I watched a red light appeared on the left side (as you are facing it) and watched. About a minute or two later, the red light went over the top of the blue object (kind or like rolling over the top of it) and was now, on the right side. I watched it for about a minute or two when suddenly, the red light shot off the blue object and came toward us.(This would have been to the east ) I trained the binoculars on it and what I saw scared the hell out of me. It was sort of delta wing shaped with an extension to the front. It was bright red and moving at an incredible rate of speed. This thing was fast! I quickly handed the binoculars to my husband who was in shock to say the least. He handed them back in time for me to see it arc toward the north. I swear but, am not sure now that I saw windows under the extension part. I couldn&#39;t tell you for sure as it moved so fast and to tell you the truth, I was so scared... I went into the house as soon as it was lost behind the trees. My husband wanted to stay out and see what happened but, I was so affraid that I was crying and begging him to come in. When we got in I asked him to draw what he saw and I would do the same. He did and I did and it came out VERY similar. I am sorry now that I was such a coward, now, and did not stay to see what happened. This was many years ago but, it has stayed in my mind. I just want to know if anyone else has ever seen anything like this or if anyone knows what it was. I am familiar with aircraft and this was nothing like I have ever seen before.<n>

I was pretty bored so I looked up into the sky at the stars when I noticed a small disk or saucer. It looked like it was at least 1,000 ft. up. It was spinning in circles coming closer to the ground. It had red and green lights on the rim. As soon as it came closer it went farther up into the sky. When the driver came back I did not tell him anything/<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

Well, for anyone out there who wants to know, one night, years ago I had been on the computer surfing the net with both my sister and brother. At the time, we were all adults- 20&#39;s and 30&#39;s.  I had been coming down the stairs from the second floor and looked out the big paladian window that faced south west.  I had been going slowly down and just gazing out that window when suddenly a reddish orangy light caught my eye.  I had seen it flash - disappear and reappear suddenly elsewhere but nearby. I thought I was seeing things so I stopped still and looked.  As I had been looking, my sister and brother came down and I told them to look outside.  We all looked and were silent, we saw more of these lights reappear then disappear at different points sort of like zig-zagging but disappearing. They were low down in the sky just above some treetops of the rouge river south.  I was amazed because I thought it might have been an airplane at first but no airplane could do these maneuvers all over the sky so quickly and randomly.  I don&#39;t know what it was to this day and neither do my sister and brother.  I know that there was someone who posted a message here in 2003 that sounds like what we saw.  This is amazing because now I can really beleive it was truly something else out there.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

The movement was slow.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Aproxamatly 2200 hours mountain standard time a friend of mine and I were standing in the parking lot of our apartments talking. I noticed a very slow moving object out of the corner of my eye. I turned to look at for two reasons; 1. we live near Hill AFB and I like to watch the aircraft take off. 2. I noticed that this craft was moving at a very slow rate of speed. Upon closer observation we both noticed that is was only about 150 yards up. The craft we were looking at was a triangular shape with three seperate lights. We atributed these lights to being wing and nose lights. As it neared us we realized that we were wrong about the lights and the origin of this craft. What we were seeing was lights that were more towards the center bottom of the object. The one thing that really struck us as not being right ws the fact that as low as it was flying there was not a single bit of sound coming from it. After the event took place we both decided that maybe we shouldn&#39;t say anything to anyone in fear of ridicule.. A little background on us. He is currently working for a construction company. I was in the Army Infantry for about 9 months until I got a medical release for an injury I sustained to my left knee. At the time of the event I was not employed and was preparing to move to California.<n>

We were all going through school at the time (college) it was two in the morning and it was very clear that evening with i think an almost full moon high in the middle of the sky. We were standind on the North shore of Lake Ontario at bluffers park in scarborough Ont. our attention had been drawn up in the sky when 1 person in the group pointed out that she had seen what looked to me to be a planet had just appeared out of thin air. it was about moon level in the sky and it was a brilliant orange round object slightly larger than the largest visible star but was much brighter than any star i have ever seen. I know there is alot of air traffic in the t.o. area but i was sure no aircraft of earth origen that can zig zag back and forth up and down at the speed It was going it seemed almost to be playing in the entire sky above us. About after 10 min we saw a airplane i know this from wacthing many planes from the exact spot for many years. As the plane approached the vicinity of IT,IT stopped. Then at a very high rate of speed traveled toward the plane. One of my good friends then screamed oh my god it is gonna hit the plane. Just before IT did it proceded to do looping zig zaging motions around the plane then just as it had been playing before ITleft the plane and continued to play some more in the sky leaving the plane alone&gt; at this point my hair was standing on the back of my head. We watched for the next 5 min or so the orange btright rond object dissaperar and reapear i know this because we saw a refletion of the light on the water which had been very calm and reflective. The light also apeared to dive frome about moon level in the sky down into the water several times and one witness also said that she thought she saw several other very tiny lights of the same orange coluo! r circel ing around and joining the light now i have poorer vision than she i know because i am suppused to ware glasses but she does not. I just found this web site and thought i cuold share this with others that think they are alone in there sightings and who are laughed at when trying to explain what they have seen without the fear of embaresement or ridicule please will someone respond?<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date and time are approximate.

It was about 1,000 through 4,000&#39; feet in altitude.  Looked to be between 5-8mi away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was driving west on FM 1960 about 5 mi.s east of FM 2100.  I had been working on a car and was at this time test driving it.  The event occoured at 20:47.  I was driving and looking at the stars since it was a CLEAR night. (visibility only distorted by minor upper- atmosphere turbulence)  I then noticed the object.  It caught my eye because of it&#39;s intense brightness.  I stared at it allowing myself to accuire a good sight of the object.  It possessed the likeness of a comet.  It was shaped as a &#34;tear-drop&#34;.  It turned out a tremendous light.  Even brighter than the moon on it&#39;s most radiant nights.  It&#39;s light was pure white with no distortion apparent.  There is a tall radio antenna with warning strobe lights situated on it; however, this is not at all what I witnessed.  The object, though described as a comet had none of a comet&#39;s properties; i.e.  A tail, haze behind the comet, small size and the other distinguishing features of a comet.  The object not only very brigh! t but also seemed to be very low (between 1,000 to 3,000&#39;) and able to acchieve great speed.  The object was headed west on about a 280 degree heading.   Although I was driving between 75-80mph it seemed to pull away from me unlike anything I have ever seen.  I attempted to try and keep up with it but I lost sight of it  when The trees alongside the road blocked my vision of the object.   Make note I live near an airport and I used to live near an Air Force base.  I know how planes fly and I know the acceleration an airplane can obtain.  But as this object was 5-8mi.s out.  For an airplane to accelerate such as this thing did it and to dissapear from my field of view it would have to have an extrodinary engine, acceleration rate, and exaust hider (afterburner, it would be needed if this were even to be tried).  I have NEVER seen such a feat.  This event escapes my mind.  I have been made fun of and discredited even by almost everyone, including friends.  Anything you could tel! l me would be GREATLY appreciated!!!! I have tried to find out if something was going on that night, plane problem, U.S. Military trial of new plane but nobody has said anything.  If you have anymore questions I can be E-Mailed at((address deleted)) I would like to try and resolve this matter. I am a very observant person. When I observed the object I was trying to remimber details of it.  I studied it closely in the short time that it remained in my vision. Thank You, ((Name deleted))<n>

I figured it was just a plane,when I looked closer it had a flat (matte) black finish and was flat,triangular shaped with a bright light at each corner. I pointed it out to my girlfriend who also agreed that it was definately a UFO. I am the biggest skeptic in the world and never reported officially until now. I am no longer a skeptic about UFO&#39;s however.<n>

I stepped outside for a cigarette and heard a strange dull humming. For a second I thought it might have been the sub pump in the basement kicking on, but then I realized the sound was coming from above the trees. I looked up and thought I saw a large commercial aircraft (at least the size of a 737) in trouble (because it was so low). Then I realized I should have heard much more noise than I did, and that it seemed to be moving below &#34;stall speed&#34; for a craft this size. It looked like a equilateral triangle with three white lights at each acute angle. I watched it glide overhead and leave. About an hour and a half later, when my boss and I went to get in his car and leave, I heard the noise again. He asked me, &#34;what the hell is that&#34; and just like in a bad alien flick I said, &#34;they&#39;re back!&#34; Whoever &#34;they&#34; were, I don&#39;t know. But the object passed right over our heads, which I guessed was only 120 ft. in the air. It looked like a solid black or dark triangle. Another unsubstantiated sighting (or a folie a deux) to some, a mind-bender for me and my boss.<n>

It was approx. 15-20 feet away, several feet from the side of my father&#39;s home. After watching it zipping around for several seconds, the glowing green ball &#39;leapt&#39; over a pinetree - approx. 20 feet high. I was able to see that it was descending once clearing the top of the pinetee. I use the term &#39;leapt&#39; because that is what it appeared it do -  quite quickly &amp; deliberately as if it did not want to be seen. The ball was florescent green (like a traffic signal at night), perfectly round, about the size of a cantalope, without a &#39;tail.&#39; It did not leave a trail or make any noise.<n>

At approx. 3:00 a.m. I noticed a glowing object in the eastern sky at about horizon level.  It was far enough away that when it moved around, the telephone and electrical wires were hiding it.  My husband asked me if I saw it and I told him yes.  We did not have the camcorder or binoculars unpacked, but we did have the site from his telescope.  You could see that the thing was changing colors from white to blue to green.  We live very close to an airport (practically at the end of the runway) and noted that there was no airplane activity.  This is very unusual for Lambert Field.  The next night at about the same time my husband and a friend saw the same light, but this time there were approx 3 objects doing the same thing as the night before.  They were convinved thath what they saw that night was a UFO.  My husband said they were much more active thath night than the night before when we saw it together.  I do not be! lieve it was a star and we have discussed if it was possible to be some type of new aircraft that McDonnell/Boeing could be testing.  We heard no noise or saw any other activity.<n>

The lights were about as bright as a satellite catching the light and shining dimly just after sunset. There were +/- five lights running along the two longer sides of the triangle.

The object flew across the sky so fast, that it looked like a meteorite. But it had red, orange, green and blue colored lights flashing rapidly around it. Then another similar object appeared. The two objects flew back and forth across the sky all night. They did not get close enough to make out a shape but sometimes they zipped away so rapidly that it was like a streak. Activity continued all night long. The deck hands reported to me that once during the night a craft without lights flew low over the boat. The next morning our boat passed by the Abraham Lincoln air craft carrier. Note that often UFO activity is reported in conjunction with military activity. Upon arriving home, in Astoria Oregon in October, my neighbor, who works in a local cafe told me that she overheard a conversation with people who said they had seen a UFO while out on a boat. I am interested to find other people who have reported similar incidents in the same vicinity.<n>

I was the first one out the door. While the others were still inside I looked up at the stars for no particular reason. In the northwest sky, just above the big dipper I noticed about 6 orange amber dots in a V formation moving north above the big dipper. I told the others &#34;hey come check this out&#34;. One dot in the V seemed to be moving in towards one leg then back out, yet keeping pace with the formation. We moved to the backyard to get a better look. As this formation started to fade it seemed to rotate into a circle formation just before disappearing. The formation definitely seemed as though it was very far away (not in our atmosphere), and possibly leaving our planet. I have seen shooting stars and satellites many times before. This was not one of them.<n>

I turned east off the main road since there was another vehicle behind me in order to view the object. I was putting my car window down when I suddenly saw an aircraft to the left and above me. It measured four to five palm breadths and was a metallic bronze color with a narrow nose/head and a short fan shaped tail.  It was relatively flat with a rectangular shape with two rows of red lights and two rows of blue lights on each side and a single row of red or blue lights on the tail.  It passed over in five to six seconds and no engine sound was heard.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When pulling out of my driveway on 09/19/97 to go to work, I turned north onto West Ave. and stopped at the stop sign.  A bright white stationary light caught my eye which I thought was an airplane against the west horizon. I remained stopped at the sign because the light was so bright. As I watched it, it appeared to stop and start very quickly several times.  I pulled away from the stop sign when I saw another vehicle behind me only to see the object speed off faster than any plane goes traveling in the same direction as my car.  To view it better I decided to turn off the main road in an east direction, put my car in park, shut off the radio and was putting my automatic window down when I suddenly saw an aircraft to the left of my car and above me.  Thinking this was the bright object I had seen, it would have been necessary for it to have made a sharp 45 degree angle in order for me to have seen it so quickly. It scared me tremendously and I remember reminding myself that there were other vehicles on the road at this time and I must not be the only one seeing this. With my car window down I was looking out to see the bright light but instead saw an aircraft that seemed unusual, rectangular in shape, large, ( it would have taken four to five palm breadths to cover the length) but not wide, (it would have taken one=half a palm breadths to  cover the width) It was a metallic bronze/chocolate color with a narrow head and fan shaped horizontal small tail compared to the large rectangular body.  No white light was visible and there was no sound made by the craft.  It seemed to move slowly above me taking five to six seconds  to pass and was not visible in the eastern horizon afterwards, however the area is densley populated with homes and large trees. I was afraid it was some type of military aircraft that had gotten off course and flying so low, I thought it would crash into the surrounding homes. Two rows of eight to twelve lights which were circular and not revolving or shining a beam were on each side of the craft. Each row was single in color and one row was red and the other blue but I cannot remember the sequence of the color.  The tail also had a row of either red or blue lights but were perpendicular to the craft and only five or six circular non-beaming lights.  The body of the craft was wider than the sides and angled down like a single step to the edges.  The lights were beneath each edge although I could not see the entire left edge of the craft. After it passed, I remember sitting in my car for several seconds wondering what it was and what I should do.  Not wanting to be late for work, I continued east on the side street to LaGrange Road thinking any aircraft that big and that low I would be able to see when I was past the trees and houses.  However, it was no where to be seen.  I went to work and returned home at approximately 1600  when I contacted the Federal Aviation Agency only to be told that most of their personnel had left for the day and they had no reports of unusual aircraft that day.  I contacted our local newspaper - The Daily Southtown - and asked about any reportings. They informed me they got their information from the local police and they had received none.  Not wanting any to think I was strange, I tried to find somewhere to report this without telling the police.  The local phone numbers for the UFO agency were disconnected.  Although I am reminded daily of the event, only today 12/02/97 did I find the phone number and web site for the National UFO Reporting Center due to a report in the Daily Southtown about another local sighting  of unusual lights two days ago.  I would like for someone to explain that what I saw was an experimental military aircraft or I would think perhaps others on their way to work may have seen the same thing I did.<n>

September 18,1997, Thursday. It looked like a slit in the sky to me. To him it looked like a red, round, stationary, glowing light low in the sky not making any sound. It kept changing colors of red, green and white, with what appeared to me to be a beam of white light shooting straight off the bottom of the rounded-elliptical top that kept flashing and changing colors. Two other objects were seen very near, or on the ground. I was looking west when I saw them take flight separately and start moving slowly to the east. They passed within 50-100 feet of the observers. Later that a.m. two more objects were seen near our home. One was a white, round light remaining stationary at treetop level as I was looking south. The other one appeared as two white, round headlights flying from the east to the west, then south. They simply blinked out right before reaching the location of the other object hovering in the southern sky at treetop level.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Here is what we saw on September 18, 1997, Thursday at about 4:15 a.m. E.S.T. from the upstairs bedroom of our home. My husband and I saw an object hovering in the sky about one mile north of where we live. It was low in sky and he says it looked like a red, round light that was not flashing and it remained stationary in the sky.It was not making any sound. It did not look like any aircraft he had ever seen in his life. It appeared to be close by and was very bright and glowing. He kept waiting for it to move, but it did not. Then he left to go downstairs to the bathroom and afterwards went back to bed. He looked before he went back to bed and it was still there. He claimed he went to sleep immediately and could not stay awake at all. He left for work at 6 a.m. and looked to the north to see if it was still there and it was not. What I saw was a rounded-elliptical object, flashing red, green and white lights that looked like a slit in the sky.It was low and in the north with no sound from it. The object appeared to have a beam of white light streaming from the bottom of it when I first saw it at 4:15 a.m. from downstairs outside our front door. I am the one who saw the two red, oval objects close to or on the ground that passed near our home within 50-100 feet of where we were. They were at or below treetop level after taking flight from or near the ground. By the time I awakened him, they already had taken flight and I was watching the first one that took off go silently by the edge of our house. The other one had re-stationed itself as a white, round light behind a tree across the alley about 100 feet away. The first one passed by at treetop about 50 feet away from us. I never did see the one across the alley fly away, it just was not there anymore by the time I went downstairs to photograph on video camera the one in the north that we both saw that was still there. Here is what I saw happen after I had seen the bright object in the north flashing and beaming a white light off the bottom of it. I went back inside to an upstairs bedroom to get a pair of binoculars to have a closer look. While there, I looked out of the window to my right to see if it was still there and it was. At that time, I also saw two more objects south of it on or near the ground. I was looking toward the west. They both were red and oval-shaped. They each rose off the ground in an odd pattern of flight. The first one rose straight up to treetop level and stopped, hovered, then moved to my left and stopped again. Then it moved back to the right and stopped again, before moving in a straight line east, toward me. The other one rose off of the ground in a diagonal movement to the left, about half as high as treetop. It moved in a straight line to the east toward me, too. The first one changed shape and color as it approached within 50 feet of where I was. It veered to the south a bit and passed out of my line of sight after it passed by the top of the treetop in the yard next to ours.It was obsured from view by the edge of our house as it continued to pass to the east from the west. They both moved very slowly...maybe 5 miles per hour. I awakened my husband (he worked on an aircraft carrier on airplanes and had a Top Secret clearance that would have been extended to Krypto clearance had he chosen to work aboard nuclear-powered submarines, but he declined, while he served in the Navy for six years. He presently works as a Machine Job Setter. He has been employed by the same company for the past twenty years). He said that it did not look like any aircraft he had ever seen while in the Navy or otherwise. He saw the one hovering in the north while I watched the one pass silently out of sight past the edge of our house. I am a housewife and mother of two children. I recently finished a Medical Transcription course. It was such a brilliant white in the center that I could hardly look at it directly. It did not cast any shadows on the treetop or the ground, which seemed strange to me, too. As it passed by the yard next door it appeared to be round in shape and white in the center with a reddish-orange outer edge. We did not see any solid structure on any of them. The second one that left the ground flew across the alley and stopped behind a tree. It had changed shape and color to a round, white light. I kept watching to see where it went, but did not see it fly anywhere. It just was not there anymore. There was a well-lit moon in the sky, no wind and it was not cloudy. When I went outside to videotape the one in the north, I could not get it to appear in my viewfinder. I went outside to start taping it about 5 minutes after reporting it and having first seen it from our front door. I could clearly see it still hovering there and it appeared very bright in the sky from just outside of our back door where I was trying to tape it from. After approximately fifteen minutes of trying to get it on tape, the battery decharged. I decided to go inside and recharge the battery. After putting it on the charger I went back out to see if it was still there. It was not. I looked around other parts of the sky for anything else unusual and saw a round, white light at treetop in the southern sky. I went back in to wait for the battery to charge up. When I got inside, it was already charged. I put it on the camera and went back out to tape the other light in the south. I was taping it when I saw an object flying from the east to the west approaching towards me. It had two bright, white, round headlights on it and then began to fly south toward the other one I was already taping. I moved my camera to tape it and it blinked out. I looked to see if it was a solid object flying without any lights and saw nothing of it anymore. I refocused my camera on the one I was taping before this one appeared and then went inside. I am not sure what time it was, I think maybe 6 a.m. because my husband had already left for work. I was very tired and went to bed. When I got up a few hours later, I played back the tape of the recently videotaped object in the south at treetop. It was not on the tape. It was very upsetting to me after all that I had seen happen that morning. I went back out the next morning to see if the one in the southern sky was in the same place as the morning before, it was not there at all. I thought maybe it was a planet or a star in the southern horizon and should be there the next day as well, if so. I am still uncertain why nothing appeared on the tape of it or what the ones were o! n the gr ound or in the sky for that matter. It especially bothers me that I can not account for what happened to cause the battery to seemingly charge up in a matter of minutes and why the one I was taping did not appear on the film. Not to mention having seen the odd pattern of flight that the two on the ground made when getting airborne. I cannot compare or identify them with anything I have seen before, neither can my husband whom I told about the other ones and what they appeared to look like and do. To add more mystery to the matter, our computer crashed several times prior in the week to seeing all of this on Thursday morning the 18th of September, 1997.<n>

She spotted something to the north, over a mountain range about twenty miles away, and alerted me. It looked like a huge, flaming star. I put the binoculars on it and it looked like something on fire, a metallic, electrical-looking fire. Long &#34;flames&#34; shooting out of something in the core. All of a sudden the &#34;flames&#34; collapsed in on themselves, seemingly sucked into the center. What was left was a flashing light that jumped around the sky, seemingly at random. Then the object began moving south-southeast, almost directly at us. It flew in basically a straight path but it would jump around from time to time. It was disconcerting to watch. It didn&#39;t seem to obey the laws of flight we are familiar with. It passed within a few miles of us. I kept my binoculars trained on it the entire time. It was saucer-shaped, with multi-colored lights moving around its edges, a large white light at the bottom and a smaller red light on top. My girlfriend got scared and ran inside the lookout. I stayed on the catwalk to watch it. It went through the sky at sort of a 45-degree angle; not flat like a frisbee. It flew, still jumping around some, over the San Joaquin Valley. AS far as I could tell, it stopped at about five thousand feet above Woodlake or Lindsay, somewhere in that area. There it remained, nearly motionless, for several minutes. Then, from the west (the direction of Lemoore Naval Air Station) there came several flashing white lights, five or six of them. These lights behaved like helicopters. Above these lights was a another, larger light which behaved like a large airplane. As these lights approached the object, the object suddenly shot nearly straight up, going from five thousand to about 30,000 feet in a blink of an eye. There it remained while the white lights flew around the airspace it had occupied (searching?). I kept my binos trained on it for many minutes until my eyes became watery. I wiped them off and when ! I looked up it was gone. The white lights eventually peeled off and returned to the west.<n>

I was sitting on a second story balcony of my then apartment which I shared with my then girlfriend.  The balcony faces west. Approximately at sunset or thereabouts.  The Sun was large, nearing but still above the horizon. Brilliant deep yellow and Orange in color.  Suddenly the Sun appeared to change in shape from it&#39;s known &#39;round&#39; to a Triangular shape. At the same time the color changed from the yellow/orange to a silvery metallic color. The Triangle appeared and disappeared a number of times. This was if you were looking directly at a perfect triangle. It did not rotate, bank or otherwise indicate any motion laterally, vertically or otherwise.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Just a perfect triangle where the sun had been. When it reappeared however the triangle was inverted, with the tip, or point at the bottom. This disappearance and reappearance happened approximately 2 or 3 times. Then as suddenly as it had appeared, it was gone and the Sun was back as though nothing had happened. There was no disturbance or change to the emitted light in the sky. There was no sound associated with this occurance. The distance to the observed object &#39;Triangle&#39; is impossible to say due to it&#39;s apparent morphing with the Sun.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had called for my girlfriend to hurry and come see what I was seeing but she wasn&#39;t interested and so did not witness.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of the incident is approximate.

My sister and I were driving up a hill by a field with a line of tall trees on either side of the road in a very rural town.  There are no street lights, so it gets very dark and clear.  Out of nowhere a bright yellow-white spherical object shot across our field of view, right in front of us, covering the arc of sky we could see between the trees flanking the road  (about 20 degrees of sky)  this occurred extremely fast (a few seconds at most)  but long enough to tell that it was a discrete spherical glowing object traveling horizontally.  It appeared similar in size to the moon, but a little brighter  (not blinding).  There was no trailing tail or &#34;halo&#34; around the object...I&#39;ve grown up in this town and seen plenty of fireball meteors (good viewing, no city lights) and this was nothing like them, I knew it the instant I saw it.  Given its speed and size, I guess it was going several hundred miles per hour no more than a hundred feet over the trees.  I was really impressed by how fast it moved.. that I especially remember.  And thinking it simply couldn&#39;t be some very large, distant object...it would have to be moving insanely fast to have the same effect, then.  My sister both were shocked, and immediately agreed that we had no idea what could possibly look or behave like what we had just saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am a research scientist and have a background that includes astronomy and physics.  My sister is a very bright, level headed student.  This event was completely outside her conceptual experience and I was just as shocked as she was.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  The witness has a very strong academic background in an technical field.  We have invited him to try to establish the date more accurately, and to have the other witness submit a report.

However I did take a large number of undergraduate classes in astronomy and physics.  As far as further information, I talked with my sister and she didn&#39;t have anything to add, and didn&#39;t want to submit a report.  We&#39;re still not sure of the date.  I know that I was picking her up from a school dance, and that I was no longer in high school myself.  That limits it to either 1997 or 1998.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Plus it was not winter (or summer).  So it was probably fall or spring.  I can tell you precisely where the event occurred, if that helps at all.  It was traveling northwest, and the object crossed our path moving east/northeast.  I don&#39;t have a map handy, but the area we were at was dead in the center of woodstock, CT, right by the intersection of Joy Rd and Rte 169.<n> <n><n> <n><n> hope this helps..<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((END))<n>

My father is the ultimate skeptic and ill never forget the look on his face whe he knew that what he saw was unexplainable. He spent many moments in deep though no doubt trying to explain to himself but after several days i asked him and he said it must have been a weather baloon or something. I will never forget that thing because it was so vivid and defined that it could not be mistaken for any known man made object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date of event is approximate.

My wife and I were told about him by a female friend living in Chicago, who had become his acquaintance. The call lasted approximately one hour, during which time he explained his origin, how he came to this planet, his people&#39;s purpose in being here, and how he currently occupied the body of a man born on earth.<n> <n><n> <n><n> During the conversation he also answered a number of my questions: about his view of our civilization, the amount of time he and those of his particular race had been on earth, the number of his people living among our population, and certain questions re: history and current events.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The gentleman was astonishingly clear and logical in his expression; almost like a scientist or professor.  He also seemed almost Spock-like in his lack of emotion.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Should you wish to have a more thorough report I can send in more detail the topics of our conversation.

PD))<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((ADDENDUM FROM SAME INDIVIDUAL WHO SUBMITTED REPORT))<n> <n><n> <n><n> Peter, I am going to break the rules as far as filing this more detailed report of my conversation with the gentleman from Chicago.  I apologize in advance, because I know you are highly disciplined in your work...It is just that I&#39;d like to get this to you via your personal e-mail (In truth, I&#39;m a real amateur on the workings of the<n> <n><n> internet.)<n> <n><n> <n><n> As you will read, I will include the names of both the extraterrestial being, as well as the man whose body he purported to occupy (who is now, as of about a decade ago, deceased.)  I will leave it to your discretion as to whether you wish to include  that purportedly occupied person&#39;s name.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Tacco and I sat down together to put in place the clear memories of what was shared.  We know that we&#39;ve lost certain things that were said - to our great regret - but what is written to you is quite accurate according to the gentleman&#39;s statements and claims.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ----------------------------------<n> <n><n> <n><n> Recollections of A Call from an Extraterrestial Who Gave Us the Name &#34;Shimikus Etua&#34;<n> <n><n> <n><n> In the summer of 1997 I received a call from a Philippine born woman in Chicago - a long time friend who once babysat for our children - with regard to an older man she had met.  The gentleman, she told us, identified himself initially as a &#34;Eugene Randall&#34; and lived in the Chicago suburbs.  She, being of an extraordinary open and pure nature, invited him to her family&#39;s residence to take more time to visit.  As a matter of fact, Mr. Randall visited our friend and her family quite regularly after the initial meeting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was in the course of these visits that Mr. Randall told our friend that he, indeed, wasn&#39;t of this world, and identified himself  as, I believe it is called, a &#34;walk-in,&#34; by the name of Shimikus Etua.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After a number of these visits by the gentleman, our friend called us to share the matter.  At the end of our phone call, I asked her if this person would mind calling me directly.  She said she thought it possible, and that he seemed quite open to share with those who could be open to him, and said she&#39;d ask him.  Several nights later, we received a call from Shimikus Etua.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The following is a listing of recollections, and personal impressions I had from the phone call:<n> <n><n> <n><n> 1.) My first impression was that I was talking to a very serious and almost professorial individual who didn&#39;t express much emotion.  He seemed almost Spock-like.  There was no feeling of his being delusional or inconsistant.  He spoke in measured tones and answered my questions without hesitation or wasted words.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 2.) Shimikus (from now on &#39;S&#39;),  said that he came from a planetary system somewhere in the vicinity of what we call the North Star.  He said that he&#39;d traveled to our planet on one of a few very large &#34;mother ships.&#34;  I believe he mentioned that he&#39;d actually been born enroute to our solar system.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 3.) It was hard for me to believe, but he gave his age as &#34;about 3000 years old.&#34;<n> <n><n> <n><n> 4.) When I asked about his civilization&#39;s belief in a supreme being he immediately answered in the affirmative.  He then went on to explain that there was a time when his people were not good (I believe he even used the word &#34;evil), and that they tended to be self destructive as well as destructive to other civilizations.  However, long ago, before the journey to earth, a &#34;priest&#34; among his people began to teach a path of goodness, that, somehow had a great impact for the good.  His people went through a tremendous change, and left behind their negativity.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 5.) S mentioned that his people are more than a little concerned with the elements of self destruction on our planet, and wish to help us evolve as a species as they did long ago (I took this to mean, in the sense of &#39;consciousness&#39; and spirituality.)  When I asked how his people look at us, he hesitated for a moment, and then said that it is how we may look at &#34;primitive tribes&#34; in our own world.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 6.) He explained that those among his race who are now on the earth have come here with the help of earth people who are aware of them, and who have voluntarily offered their bodies and personae as vehicles for these aliens.  S spoke in glowing terms of Eugene Randall, who had offered himself for S.  (note: I could see that this whole matter of earth people contributing their bodies was entirely of their own free volition, and not anything like a hostile take over, ie, the 1950&#39;s horror classic, &#34;Invasion of the Body Snatchers.&#34;)  S also mentioned a Russian man, who, years ago during the Soviet period, had done what Eugene had done; the same admiration and gratitude was expressed for his courage and sacrifice.  (I don&#39;t remember the details of the Russian man&#39;s story.)<n> <n><n> <n><n> 7.) I asked how many of S&#39;s people were on the earth in the capacity mentioned above.  He estimated it to be about 8,000.<n> <n><n> Living in Seattle, I asked if he knew how many may be in the Puget Sound area.  He said he didn&#39;t know, and that they are not all in good contact with one another (I got the feeling that this race of people has been among us for a very long time, according to his<n> <n><n> conversation.)   He did mention that there was a way for me to find<n> <n><n> someone if I wished; he explained that there is a symbol that his race uses, and went on to explain it:  It is two squares, one over the other, something similar to the Jewish star of David.  Only the squares are juxtaposed: One drawn straight up and down, and the other rotated so that the corners of the second square extend out past the middle of each of the first star&#39;s mid-lines - so you end up with an eight-pointed star shape.<n> <n><n> S told me that if I put this symbol in my car window, I may be approached and asked about where I learned the symbol...&#34;that may be one of our people&#34; he told me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 8.) S expressed the serious concern of his race for our use of nuclear power, and said that even the &#34;peaceful use&#34; of nuclear reactors is very harmful to the cosmos.  Nuclear war was just a horror, as he expressed it, not just for us but for the others in our cosmos.  He said we didn&#39;t begin to understand the problems nuclear energy creates.  He also mentioned a concern for mid eastern wars, and the use of chemical weapons.  Though I didn&#39;t learn just how, S said that his people have ways to counteract the weapons we build; he mentioned their spoiling of chemical weapon stockpiles in Iran.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 9.) (I had some trouble getting this) The flood of Noah was mentioned:<n> <n><n> S explained that one of their larger spacecraft had lost its bearings and crashed in the arctic regions, causing a tremendous and sudden meltdown of ice, and subsequent flooding of portions of the globe (I assumed a tremendous explosion and release of energy.)  This, he said, was a contributing factor to the flood.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 10.) Situations of co-habitation with earth people: It was also mentioned to me that there was a history of sexual co-habitation between members of S&#39;s race and earth people.  In particular, he mentioned that there were cases of this in the Philippine Islands (modern name), and that quite a few hybrid children were born as a result.  Lineages continue to this day.  An interesting note is that S mentioned our former babysitter who he had first met, and who had called us about him, was of that hybrid lineage.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 11.) I asked if there are any other extraterrestial civilizations near earth at this time.  He said that there are, and that, unlike his own people, they don&#39;t all have their personal problems worked out.  While his own civilization has only the desire to help us develop in a positive direction, there are others who would use us for cruel experimentation - almost like animal labs, and even  practice self gratifying sexual abuse with our people (certain horrible abduction experiences? - my reflection).  S mentioned that his people try to drive off these evil races when possible.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 12.) A humorous incident:  S has a brother, he told me, named Andronicus.  He said that one day, in downtown Chicago, they were in an elevator in a high rise building, and somehow, were in their original forms...A businessman suddenly entered the elevator, looked at them in shock, and blurted out, &#34;Where did you come from?!&#34;<n> <n><n> Andronicus, who was just as shaken up, reacted with, &#34;Well, from my mother!&#34; (S did mention that if I saw him in his original form, that I may be startled, though I got the sense that it is not that far from our own earthly bodies.)<n> <n><n> <n><n> 13.) S visited our friend, the Philippine woman, many times in the form of Eugene Randall.  She told me in a call sometime after my call with him, that he came to her home one afternoon to help celebrate her birthday.  After a while he expressed weariness and asked if he could take a rest.  She put him on the bed that she and her husband slept in.  Soon, a group of her church friends came by to say happy birthday, and saw this &#39;unknown man&#39; on her bed.  They became outraged and spread gossip about her.  When she later told S about what had happened, he became sad and upset at the same time.  He told our friend, and I paraphrase here, &#34;How long have our people been here on this planet working to help you, and still you don&#39;t understand the meaning of friendship and trust!&#34;<n> <n><n> <n><n> *Several years ago, our friend called and told us that Eugene Randall had been found dead in his apartment by a neighbor.  What of Shimikus?<n> <n><n> I have no idea, nor does she.<n>

It looked as if it decended into the Cascade Mountains somewhere. It was nearly Impossible to judge the distance to this thing It could have been a couple of miles away or it could have been a couple of hundred miles away.

He&#39;s been in air force family all of his life and also AIR Force ROTC high school &amp; part college.  What scared him most was that it made absolutely no noise of any kind.  This was how he knew it was no ordinary aircraft or military craft.

A major thunder storm was approaching from the west.  Hozel road heads north from Swamp Road.  It then takes a 90 degree turn west for about 800 yards before intersecting Radio Road, which runs north.  About 300 yards prior to the intersection, I observed an object about 700-800 yards distant at tree-top level.  I took no immediate notice because there is a large blue-green water tower located in the general direction.  This tower, however, is only visible from Radio Road about 200 yards north of the mentioned intersection.  When I took deliberate notice, I observed a disk-shaped object with a small cylindrical superstructure centered on the upper half of the disk. This structure&#39;s top came to a point.  The object was silver in color but didn&#39;t shine; like lead. I saw no movement or heard no noise.  I glanced at the road then back at the tree-tops and the craft was gone.  This had taken seconds so I was not sure what had just happened (or if it happened.)  As I turned north on Radio Road, I glanced to my left, over a farmer&#39;s  field and again saw the object, this time almost totally below the tree-tops and on a sharp (45 degree+) angle (north side lower than south side of craft.) This was at about 300 yards.  From this point I could also see the water tower.  It was clear they were not the same object. The flying object did, however, closely resemble the top of the water tower in shape (definetly not in color or direction.) I turned my attention back to the road and once again, the object was gone.  Several months later, I was relating this story to my Brother-in-law and his girlfriend.  The girl got a little upset.  Talking to her, I found that her bedroom window looked out over this same field from it&#39;s northern edge.  She said she had occasion to witness bright lights coming from the field at night, more than once.<n>

Then both moved away and vanished!<n> <n><n> <n><n> My daughter and I were on our way to visit my parents in Centerpoint, TX from San Antonio. We had just left Comfort, (a small hill-country town) when the lady in the car ahead of us applied her brakes quite suddenly and swerved off the road, looking up in the air. Thinking something was wrong, I slowed and stopped and my natural urge was to look up as well. About that time my daughter (who was 3 at the time, almost 4) said, &#34;Look Daddy, an airplane!&#34;.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Looking at the object that hovered there in the clear sky (there were no clouds), I saw immediately that it wasn&#39;t an airplane. What I/we saw was a cylindrical (spelling?) object that looked like it was made from a highly reflective silver metal. It was a cylinder &#39;standing slightly on end&#39; almost like a silvery beer can about to start to tip over. It just stayed there, not moving. I could see the sunlight reflecting off of it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I looked at the lady ahead of me and she looked back at about the same time. She pointed in the air and made a &#39;questioning&#39; guesture by shrugging her shoulders and pointing up. I shrugged back. Neither of us got out of our vehicles. Looking back at the object, it was still there. I felt remarkably calm though I knew it was some kind of object that couldn&#39;t be easily identified. I felt kind of &#39;dreamlike&#39; or in a slightly drugged state. I turned on the radio to see if there were any more anywhere else (don&#39;t know; thought it might be a wave of them or something... I know it sounds wierd but it was one of my first reactions- probably too much Independence Day movie or something). The radio worked fine.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I looked back at the object just as my daughter said &#34;Look Daddy, a falling star!&#34; and pointed. There was a sudden shower of &#39;sparks&#39; above and to the left of the object (from my vantage point) and suddenly there was ANOTHER object, an exact copy of the original in the area where the sparks appeared. This object was &#39;cantered&#39; at the same angle. The were identical in every aspect that I could determine.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then suddenly they both quickly receded to nothing but pinpoints, as if they moved directly away from us at extremely high speeds or as if they suddenly shrunk to nothing. There were no trails, no sparks, nothing... They both receded at exactly the same rate. I started my truck quickly and sped up the road &#39;after&#39; them; the road roughly paralleled the path they took. I barely glanced at the woman on the way by but she looked remarkably calm as well; not really shaken.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I drove after them (in the same direction I would be heading to go to my parent&#39;s), I turned the events over in my mind. It finally started to &#39;sink in&#39; what I had seen. I look all over the sky as I drove but I never saw them again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Driving the few miles left to my parents house, I said my &#34;hello&#39;s&#34; and then grabbed my dad&#39;s binoculars from his gun cabinet. I looked at the sky until the sun went down but saw nothing else...<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am not saying it was aliens but it was definetly something...<n> <n><n> <n><n> RT -Age 36<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

It was greyish black in color, I think the object was about one thousand feet in the air. I could only see the bottom of the object, I couldnt see any markings or windows. As I noticed the object flying over the city coming towards me, it flew very slow and was very quiet. When the object was above me it made a slow turn , not like a plane turns very wide, this object seemed to stop and rotate and then it slowly accelerated gaining altitude until it was out of site. This object never traveled very fast, in fact it seemed to move very slow. The object seemed to fly in a horizontal position, because of the way it approached, turned and departed.  I personally think it was secret millitary craft, and not an alien spacecraft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approxiamte.  PD))<n>

I was actually looking to the belly of the object.  At arm&#39;s distance, the object was about 6 inches and it had no features such as tail fins that could be seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At the beginning I thought that it was some kind of cruise missile that was being tested, but that was impossible.  I noticed that the object did not produce a jet or propeller noise at all.

9/10/97 19:00|Alta Loma|CA|Circle|60 minutes +|Very bright circular object about 1500 to 2000 above ground level very slowly moving to the southwest.|1/28/99|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/005/S05012.html|45|ndxe199709| Very bright circular object about 1500 to 2000 above ground level very slowly moving to the southwest.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A large circular objected was seen about 1500 feet agl over the lower mountain area due south of MT. Baldy. I was coming down the mountain and was about 6 miles north of Alta Loma California when I and my partner observed the bright circular object appearing to maintain both it&#39;s altitude and position. We pulled over to the side of the road and I inspected the object with 10X50 binoculars, but could dicern no further detail because of the extremely bright &#34;reflection.&#34; We initially thought the object was a weather or scientific balloon and that it was reflecting the sun - over the horizon. Given the approximate 2000 asl of the hills I estimate the object to have been about 3500 to 4000 feet above sea level. As we watched the object we were perplexed to see how the object could have been reflecting the sun which had already set. Additionally, we were viewing an object which was south-west of our position. Which should have minimized if not eliminated the potential reflection. After deciding it &#34;couldn&#39;t be a UFO&#34; we proceeded down the road and lost view of the object. I am very familiar with the area as both a resident and private pilot, having flown throughout the local area from Brackett airport in Pomona. Such an object would be a hazard to airmen in the area, especially at that time of night. I returned on the following day at about 1900 and observed the object again. This time I only watched it moving for about 20 minutes, then proceeded along the mountain road in an effort to gain a closer vantage point. Once I moved to a point that should have been directly east of it, I was no longer able to see the object. I returned to the prior vantage point (north-east where I lost visual contact) and could not relocate the object. There was a period of about 20 minutes from the point that I moved south-west to get closer to the object and when I returned to the initial vantage point. I am a former California licensed private investigator with over 15 years of surveillance experience as well as a former Marine Corps Intelligence Analyst assigned to the Air Wing. I am very familiar with most objects/craft including fixed/helo military and civilian and I could not identify what this object was. I continued to be struck by the brillant light eminating/reflecting from the object. If it is (i.e. the sighting report on 11/10/98 at 1138) a &#34;metallic weather baloon&#34; there should be some known data collection location. I was unable to locate one through my contacts with the FAA control tower at Brackett airfield.<n>

It was full daylight, and it had a lighter shade than the rest of the sky. There was no clouds at all, and it lasted for about one minute. Then it disappered, and reappered after a while for another minute at the  same spot. We drove a car when it appeared. It would surprise me if no one else noticed it.<n>
9/9/97 21:30|Roseburg|OR|Light|2 hours|Light bouncing around a valley. Light changes intensity, brightness, and color.  Disappears, reappears different location.|1/28/99|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/003/S03340.html|47|ndxe199709| Light bouncing around a valley. Light changes intensity, brightness, and color.  Disappears, reappears different location.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On 9/9/97 at about 9:30 p.m., a friend and myself were watching the most severe thunderstorm to hit our area that summer. Shortly into our weather session, my friend says, &#34;hey, do you see that?&#34;.  I looked where he was pointing.  The object was zipping into this valley about 5 miles away to our wnw.  We were located about 10 miles nw of Roseburg OR., USA. The object would be real dim, then brighten intensly, brighter than Venus, but pulsing also, sometimes every color of the rainbow, it seemed.  At one point, the light went down out of sight, then a pause, then it came shooting up out of the valley like a squiggly glowing red sperm, then disappear. Then it would reappear from somewhere else, moving a different direction. Keep in mind, a pretty violent thunderstorm is blasting lightning down, rather close to us at times.  This object was below the cloud deck. At one point it appeared to come very close to us, I swear, I could makeout some sort of lighted window panes, with a darker one in between. I assumed the object was close at that point, possibly within a few hundred yards.  In any case it must have been rather small, perhaps less than 15 meters in size. Well, this went on for about 1.5 hours and we simply weren&#39;t watching the lightning anymore, we didn&#39;t even care that it was getting within 10 miles of us. Ok your thinking, ball lightning right. No.  I would have settled for that, but then something remarkable happened. my friend was looking around for the onject to reappear somewhere else, like it was doing, then I saw it, a perfect white cone of light beaming accross the bottom of the thunderclouds.  There was very little thunder, and no rain at our location, and we could hear no aircraft of any kind. This &#34;spotlight&#34; came from the object, which had reappeared again. I yelled to my friend, but it disappeared just then.  It happened again, and we both saw it. This time, the object was near us and it beamed that perfect white light right above our heads about 100 feet and &#34;scanned&#34; the hillside right behind us. I have been an amateur astronomer and weather observer for well over 15 years, and I have never witnessed an event like this, in fact I have to say, it has been the most troubling event in my life. I also want to point out, at one time it appeared that the one object went into the valley, then came out with another one attached by, &#34;energy&#34; Something strange out there, and I think these strong storms have an adverse affect on them.<n>

When the large one slowed down. The other two literally vansished. the large one came to a complete stop and hovered over our location slowly ascending. I managed to get a picture of it at one point. You could see the object was plainly metallic with and appeared to be layered with distinct lines. The sun was glinting off of it. It moved through the small puff clouds that were passing over and was till visible as they passed underneath.  As one cloud large cloud moved in and passed under it, I lost sight of it and when cloud moved on the craft was no longer there. I witneesed this object from the 15 floor window of the luxor hotel accross from the airport. Our room faced the front of the hotel. I sent my negative to a lab hear locally who did a stereo graph analysis of the pic to get an ide of it&#39;s size and height above the ground. the height was approximated at 1000 feet agl. The object was estimated at least 60 feet in diameter. I remember this day well. It changed my life and my beliefs.<n>

One side of the triangle was red, one other side was blue.  Both of these sides had a horizontal string of very bright lights straight through the middle, of strobe brightness.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I think I was born with my eyes on the sky.  I have always been fasinated with the stars and planets.  I take my children and grandchildren out to the  yard during summer nights and point out the constellations.  Show them satalights going overhead, explain how regular their orbits are.  We stay up half the night in July/August to observe the meteor shower every year.  My father flew small planes and I grew up at the airport.  We have numerous fly overs from the military with large helicopters and transports, we see lots of police helicopters at night and we&#39;re also in the flight holding pattern for Sea-Tac Airport.  I know what&#39;s up there and I know what it sounds like and I know what it  looks like day or night. The morning of the sighting I got up to use the bathroom and saw the Orion constellation was incredibly bright and beautiful that morning so I stepped out onto our rear deck to view it, as soon as I stepped out onto the deck this object, impossible to miss was hovering directly in front of me at the tree line.  It wasn&#39;t moving and it wasn&#39;t making any sound.   It was about 30 feet in width in direct proportion with the side of a hockey puck.   It was split in precise halves, one side red the other blue, with a string of very bright, strobe bright, lights horizontilly through the center of the object.  It just hung there for some minutes.  It started to slowly move sideways to the west, traversed the width of our little valley and then started gaining altitude, now moving northwest, gaining not more than another30 feet or so in altitude, just enough for me to see it&#39;s underside which was triangular shaped with 6 large lights. One at the front, then two,  then three.  It then changed direction, the point of the triangle headed northwest. I could again see the blue side. It then went out of sight behind a stand of trees.  Before it disappeared I took a picture with my camera but of course it didn&#39;t come out.  I don&#39;t like sounding like a cliche.  This is not my first sighting here from my home.  The last one here was in the winter of 91.  It was about 60 feet across hovering over my neighbors home.  Looked like an inverted gas stove burner.  You could clearly see a metalic ring above the flame but nothing else.   This was at 3:00 A.M. Thought I&#39;d lost my mind or was dreaming and then the next night KOMO TV evening news showed a video of the object taken the night before in Puyallup around 8:30 P.M. Please, I would really like to talk to someone about these things.  By the way I have an I.Q. of 132, I&#39;m not hysterical, easily influenced, or excitable and I&#39;m analitical by nature.  I first check everything off the list it can&#39;t be.<n>

We were looking for sattelites because that is usually where they fly by frequently, but this was way to fast for a sattelite. This covered the distance from horizon to horizon about three times faster than any sattelite that I have witnessed yet. Almost too fast to track with a tripod. It definitely wasn&#39;t ours. I live by Selfridge Airbase and have seen doughnuts on a rope stuff before, this left no signature, and it&#39;s not the first sighting that I have had. I had previously seen a U.F.O. through my 13&#34; aperture scope. You would have to ask me about that one!<n>

I thought they were planes, though I thought that it was strange to be flying over a city like that and without blinking running lights. Then they changed direction and flew northwest, but assumed a V formation. I still thought they were planes. Then one of the lights after the leader suddenly left formation did a zippy ring around the leader and darted around it in a most-impossible maneuver for a plane, then resumed its position in the V. Lasted all of 20 seconds, but it floored me. Of course, because I thought they were planes until the very end, I didn&#39;t call out for witnesses. Anyone else seen this . . . .?<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness holds an advanced degree and is employed in a position of considerable responsibility.  Date may be approximate.  PD))<n>

Landed in Zurich Switzerland took train from air port to take a fery from Rinsehorn to Fedrickshaven Germany to meet with Family&#39;s relitives. Armed with a Sharp HI 8 view cam took video every step of the way and durring entier durration of 2 week trip in Europe. I took video out train window while at a station in Switzerland. Seen in video: birds flying about a Swis Clock tower... Then some object (metalic looking)* emerges from in back of the Swis Tower and stopps for one half second then dipps down at a 45 degree slope.... and disapeares! I did not see object durring the video taping... but after playing it back on tv I saw something strange so I rewoned the tape and played it back in slow motion and frame by frame, and it apeares to have reflective properties suggesting it might be metalic. *Under further amature alalisis I ran it through my computer using SNAPY 3.0 Delux and enlarged it, and it appears to be a somewhat oval disk shape matalic and blueish in color and white glare on top, and a super dark (black) shadow on bottom. I played the rest of the tape and saw some other strange fast flying objects flying in the sky including one emearging from lake Constance, near an old Cassel. That is all. PS please excuse my spelling.<n>

We were having a smoke and admiring the clear and starry sky when I noticed a medium brightness star moving slowly eastward directly overhead. It seemed to be very far away. It was insignificant but didn&#39;t seem to be a plane. I thought it might be a satellite. I asked my wife if it was a plane but we thought not since it was not a blinking light but just a slowly moving star. As we both studied it, the star made a perfect right angle turn toward the north and continued at the same slow speed for another 15 seconds and then made another 90 degree turn back towards the east. It moved at the same slow speed for a couple of seconds and then shot off in the same direction at incredible speed and disappeared over the horizon. It left no trail and the brightness never changed. It was so small an event but I&#39;ve never found a way to explain it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))<n>
