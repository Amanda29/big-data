This was long before the paranormal was widely accepted, and there was no knowledge of this reporting entity. The report that follows is actually two seperate incidents that occurred within a short time of one another, within 1/4 mile of each other on the same farm.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As a farmer one must always be aware of the conditions of your farm, and everything on it.  You must stay aware of your field conditions, your water supply, and the condition of your livestock. You also keep an eye turned to the sky for your weather reports.  While checking the fields and livestock one day, my father noticed three large patches of green grass in the northernmost field on our farm. This field was the most secluded part of the farm,sloping down toward the north, away from the nearest roadway over 3/4 of a mile away,and tucked in between huge areas of timber 400 acres to the east and north, and even more meeting it, and wrapping all the way around to the west, stretching on to the south.  The patches of grass were round,smoothly round, not irregular, and roughly 6 feet across.  The patches were in a perfect triangle shape with approximately 15 to 20 feet between circle. At this time of the year in southwest Missouri, after a long hot summer there is no fresh green grass, with most of the field turning quite brown by this time, and having been grazed down short by the cattle, and sheep.   These patches however were dark green and lush, like fresh spring grass,and stood out in sharp contrast with the field around them.  There had been no water available other than rain fall, and this was pasture land so it was never fertilized.  This same phenomenon was seen in this same at slightly different locations on two or three other times in the years before and after this event.  I have no explanation of the cause, but the reports I have been hearing in recent times of the frequent sighting of triagle UFO&#39;s struck a chord with me, triggering the memories of these unusual triangles in the grass.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The second incident took place in the field immediatly southeast of where the circles were seen slightly later in the same year, in mid October.  When we went to the farm to make our daily stock count, and field check we found what had been one of our sheep.  I say it that way because the sheep, 100-120 lb ewelooked as if it had been hit by a giant lawnmower, or as I used to tell peoplel like she was cut to pieces then dropped from a great height. She was scattered like when you take a hand full of confetti,hold up your hand then suddenly open your hand and let it drop.  This was not an animal attack.  Running a large flock of sheep teaches you the signs of that. Coyotes will attack a single sheep then eat the parts it wants. Dogs run through the flock slashing, and killing as a game often eating nothing. This ewe was very different.  There was no blood at the sight, the skull was completely missing, as were the hooves,and heart with most of the rest just looking like it blew up.  This was a one time thing,with investigations revealing nothing,but there were wide reports of animal mutilations in the region at this time. I report these incidents here due to the proximity to each other, and the fact we had previously had a good  clear UFO sighting over this area, of probably 30+ minutes in duration, and being seen by my extented family, of aunt, uncle, cousins, and grandparents, as well as my immediate family of four.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

I was very sceptical about this sort of thing but this convinced me. We were camping at a hunting reserve in Ukiah. We were all camped out in the middle of the night, looking at the stars, laying back in our sleeping bags. I was seventeen at the time and didn&#39;t care about anything but the blonde in the bag next to me. We watched a point of light go east to west high up in the sky. I thought it was a satillite; we saw them all the time. This particular one cruised across the night, stopped dead cold, a second point of light seperated from it, went due east, and the first light sped off north and disappeared. The other light sped off east rapidly and disappeared over the horizen. I knew these two objects were not in the atmosphere. Go figure. Not much, I agree, but enough for me to look at things a bit different. Maybe other folks have seen something similiar; I&#39;d be curious to know.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date and time may be approximate.  We have many reports on file that are similar to this one in several respects.  Satellites almost invariably do not orbit to the west, with only very few exceptions, e.g. the Soviet &#34;Molnya&#34; spacecraft.  PD))<n>

It was a week night, but neither of us had to work the next day so we caught a late movie and went for a drive.    We were on PCH directly in front of the Pier.   Everything on the pier was closed and there was no one else in sight.   Suddenly, an object appeared out of nowhere and began hovering over our vehicle.  There were several lights coming from the object that alternated between yellow, green, and red.  The object followed us down PCH.  The next thing we remember, we were on the 605 freeway heading towards Los Angeles, and it was a little after 3:00 a.m.   We are now divorced, but neither one of us ever spoke of this matter again.   I have had 3 other sitings:  1967, 1987, and 1997.  I feel there is some significance to the 10 year intervals.  I seldom speak of these incidents because family and friends don&#39;t believe me.  They think I was either dreaming or just saw an airplane.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  The date of the incident is approximate.  PD))<n>

I turned off the interstate to take a short cut but I made the wrong turn. I was just outside of Black River Falls, WI. when I noticed what appeared at first to be a forrest ranger tower in the horizon. Then I noticed that it was coming closer and closer. It didn&#39;t make any sense. I then thought perhaps a helicopter or something. Seeing as we had a airforce base just maybe 45 miles away. It all of a sudden appeared at tree top level along side my vechicle and was a big ball of light. It followed me for approximately 4 to 5 miles when I started to enter a one horse small town and it disapeared. I pull over at a the only business open in town, it was a tavern and asked if I could use there phone in order to call for a sheriff. I called the county sheriffs office who then patched me through to a officer on patrol back in Black River Falls. I explained my delima and said I wish to have an escort back to the interstate because my girl friend and I felt threatened. He said that I had a 15 mile trip back and that I should meet him at the truck stop called the Oasis. So reluctantly I did and on the way back we encountered the same object. My girl friend started screaming and I started praying, I slowed to a halt and rolled down the window to look at what was hovering over the road about 100 yards in front of me and I heard absolutely nothing. I then started the vehicle back up and continued driving towards the light. It hovered up and over the back of my vehicle and followed for about 5 miles or so and then vanished. When I made my way into the Oasis truck stop, I immediately ran into the truck stop restaurant and spotted two sheriffs. They invited me to sit down and tell my story, all along I could see they were both nervous as hell. When I finished they took my name and phone number and told me that they seen this same ufo in a farmers field with the family that called it in two days earlier. Believe me they were frightened because it was their patrol area. Years later I contacted one of the sheriffs that I may have spoken to and he denied that the incident ever happened.<n>

While driving on I-65 going south through Alabama/Tennessee and it was late at night probably around 11 pm as well, I truly had a close encounter with whatever, which is all I can say.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At the time my now ex-wife was sleeping beside me in the car so she new nothing about it as it was happening and when I woke her up after this event was over she shrugged it off as a figment of my imagination even though she noticed that I was flushed and sweaty.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What occurred was that I saw a very large and extremely bright light that reminded me of a locomotive train light just behind me about 50yds or so just appear suddenly and it followed me at the same pace but its movement was so strange to me as I noticed because it didn&#39;t fluxuate with the contour of the road as I was moving or was I and there was no sound as if a helicopter.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I wanted to alert my wife but I felt controlled as if in a trance or some hypnotic mind control and the only thing I felt that I could do was to only use my eyes to just look in the forward direction which caused me to keep glancing in the rear view mirror from time to time and as well, I noticed my palms were sweaty but for sure this was all I was allowed to do, I felt controlled to only be able to keep my hands on the wheel.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It seemed like for ages even though in this report I say maybe a half hour and just as it appeared so did it suddenly disappear but to tell you the truth, I don&#39;t really remimber how long that this occurrence was happening or maybe time was standing still or whatever, I don&#39;t really know.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The other thing that I keep going over and over in my mind besides the light is that I noticed there were no cars in either direction all the time this occurrence was happening up until it was gone which also seemed strange for an interstate highway<n> <n><n> <n><n> But anyway the years have passed and the other day I was watching the history channel on ufo&#39;s and strange sightings so I was compelled to go on the net and do a little surfing and your site came up and well, now you know mine. I never felt comfortable talking about this subject even to this day but it seems like a lot of people are coming forward so, why not I.<n>
8/15/77 20:30|Bristol|IN|Sphere|30 seconds|Large Orange Glowing Orb Witnessed in August of 1977 or 1978.|7/19/10|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/076/S76484.html|6|ndxe197708| Large Orange Glowing Orb Witnessed in August of 1977 or 1978.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This event occurred many years ago when I was a teenager camping with parents and relatives in northern Indiana.  As best as I can remember, this event occurred during the summer vacation after I completed the 7th or 8th grade.  It’s hard to be exact on this point as so many years have elapsed, but I can be certain of the month, August, because that’s when my father always took his two week vacation which we spent camping.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My Aunt, my cousin, and myself were enjoying live music, a country band if I remember correctly, in an enclosed pavilion at the campground when we decided to step outside for some fresh air.  It was a very warm August evening around 20:30; the air was very heavy and thick, as most August evenings are, and I remember taking in a deep breath of the cooler outside air.  We had walked a bit from the pavilion, making small talk, and found ourselves among a stand of pine.  I had glanced up, for no particular reason, and spotted a very large, orange colored orb hovering right above.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I pointed up immediately and said ‘Look!’.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My cousin and Aunt both looked up and stared in amazement.  The orb was very large and seemed as big as a three-story house.  It’s hard to say how far away it was, but I remember thinking to myself that I could almost reach up and touch it.  I think I may have actually stretched out my hand.  The orb had a very distinct glow to it, that’s honestly, hard for me to articulate.  The best description I can come up with, and I’ve thought about this from time to time over the years since the event, is that if you could imagine a giant pumpkin that’s been carved very close to the rind, and then a large lit candle place within so that it appears that the surface is emanating light, rather than a direct light source…if this makes sense.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The event lasted maybe 30 seconds, the object never moved, never made a sound, and then it just blinked out and was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I looked up at my Aunt who was still staring with her jaw gaped open, and said, ‘Did you see that!?’.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My Aunt was silent, but my cousin said, ‘I think it was a firework,’ as if to provide some kind of reasonable explanation.  I said in return, ‘There’s no way that was a firework, I think it was a UFO’.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We all walked back to the pavilion in silence.  We never spoke of the event after that night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There is one more detail here that I’m not totally sure about, but when we returned the band was wrapping up, and I could swear that when we had left they were just about to take a small break, not finish for the night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I’ve heard of ‘Missing Time’ since the event and I’m not saying that’s what happened.  I just wanted to note this point because I remembered at the time thinking that is was kind of strange that the band was packing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I’ve always wondered if anyone else had ever seen an object such as this one during the summer of 77 or 78, so I decided to share this event with you folks.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I’ll always remember the amazement and utter awe I felt that night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

My home of Caribou, Maine, at the time, was home to Loring AFB, a Strategic Air Command base.  I have since retired from the Air Force after 21.5 years.  The area is extremely rural and remote, Caribou being the largest city in northern Maine.  I had returned home on leave and was out on a date.  We parked near some railroad tracks and had a view of the horizon, as created by hilly potato field.  The sun was down but you could make out the horizon line.  I saw a circular light approximately the size of a dime held at arms length, travel across my field of vision, above the horizon line.  It was green, hazy on the edges and traveled across my field of view and disappeared below the horizon in 5 to 10 seconds.  Being familiar with aircraft and having seen numerous meteorites in the area, I determined that it could not have been either.  It moved to slow to be a meteorite and had no characteristic lights that would mark it as an aircraft.  No sound was heard.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of the incident is approximate.  PD))<n>
8/15/77 17:00|Rolla|MO|Disk|Not sure|The object was hovering and moving slowly toward the field.|7/5/05|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/044/S44603.html|8|ndxe197708| The object was hovering and moving slowly toward the field.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was nine years old at the time, We lived in a rural area outside of Rolla, Missouri. There was this older gentleman and his wife that lived accross the street from us. He had just purchased a new Kodak One Step Camera for a trip that he and his wife were going to take, and asked some of us kids that were playing nearby at the time if he could take our pictures, he wanted to try out the camera. We were standing in his driveway waiting for the first picture to develop when this huge shadow blocked out the sunlight. I looked up and saw this object, it wasn&#39;t emitting any sound what so ever, it was like one of the smaller ones in close encounters, with lights spining all around it. This took place &#34;before&#34; I saw the movie. I still do not understand how I could see the lights so brightly, in daylight! The older gentleman, my eleven year old brother, myself, two twin boy&#39;s that were around 7 if I recall corretly and one other 10 year old girl all took off in the direction that the object headed. It wasn&#39;t going fast at all, kind of hovering and slowly moving off toward a fenced field that we picked blackberries in. We went as far as the bob wire fence and then stopped. The object just hovered in the middle of the field, about 3 stories above the ground. The older man snaped a shot of it, and my older brother wanted to climb over the fence and get closer, I stopped him. I don&#39;t remember feeling afraid, I wasn&#39;t even shocked, I just didn&#39;t want him going any closer. I was only nine, If I saw one now I would probably freak out! We all crowded in as the picture was developing, it turned out pure &#34;white&#34; Like when you try to take a photo of something too bright. Now this is all that I can remember happening, we were looking at the photo and then our backs were turned away from the field and we were heading home, the sun was going down. My brother and I went home and told our mom what had happened, my oldest brother placed a call to the radio station and asked if anyone else had reported seeing anything... he was told,&#34;It must have been a weather balloon&#34; We never talked about that evening with the older man accross the street, the other children and even my brother and myself didn&#39;t discuss it until years later. He can&#39;t remember anything after looking at the photo either. To my knowledge, that is the only incident in my life of witnessing a UFO.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of the event is approximate.  PD))<n>

We had spent many hours in our planes and on this particular occasion we were getting ready to go to Colorado; my husband wanted to see if we would need oxygen at (not certain of the exact altitude) 12-13 thousand feet.  (I have his log book at our home in Indiana and I&#39;m at our home in Florida as I write this; this will give the exact date and possibly the altitude)<n> <n><n> <n><n> We drove our ElCamino from South Bend to Plymouth, where our plane was hangered, about 2:00 am, did our pre-flight noticing nothing out of the ordinary.  He needed night flying and also time &#34;under the hood&#34; for his IFR rating; so he decided to kill a few birds at one time.  (It&#39;s been so long since this happened and my husband would not allow me to talk about it while he was alive; but I&#39;ll try to get as close to what the distances are as I can remember)<n> <n><n> <n><n> He was going to do a 5 or 10 mile precision turn up to the 12 or 13 thousand mark and I was his &#34;spotter&#34;.  The 5 or 10 mile precision turn means that you keep making circles around a central point and climb so many feet per minute.  My job was to keep quiet and watch for any traffic.  The night was clear as a bell and there was no traffic at SBN who we had filed our flight plan with.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We started our climb and the sky was empty; no traffic any direction.  About 20 minutes into the climb I noticed traffic at 1:00 o&#39;clock.  I looked up again and the same traffic was at 1:00o&#39;clock.  This happened the third time and I said to myself (because he had told me to keep completely quiet so he could concentrate); this cannot be happening because we are making a CIRCLE and the traffic is in EXACTLY the same spot.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It came a little closer from the first time I noticed it till the exercise was finished; but not much.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It only appeared as a light coming straight towards the plane.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It seemed too far away the whole time that I never feared of it hitting us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I felt like they or someone knew exactly what I was thinking.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I felt that it was magnetically &#34;glued&#34; to the plane because it NEVER moved an inch.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I kept scooting around to make double certain that it wasn&#39;t a reflection of light from any place in the plane; it was not a reflection.  I even put both hands up to the glass and looked at it like that.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When we finally were within 1000 feet of out goal my husband asked me to light a cigarette for him; at that time I finally said, &#34;We have something at one o&#39;clock&#34;.<n> <n><n> <n><n> He said, &#34;Congratulations, it has been there since 3 thousand feet&#34;.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My husband had gotten the Bronze Star in WW2 and was never one who would become excitable; this is an important aspect in this event.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I asked him to call SBN to see if we had traffic and he wouldn&#39;t do it; finally I coaxed him into it and they replied to us that not only did we not have traffic that he hadn&#39;t seen any in our area all night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We broke formation and headed for the airport and it came with us for two or three minutes and when we signaled for the lights to come on in the airport it changed position to dropping behind us; it had followed us down as we lost altitude.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As we were landing it kept getting closer and closer to us; as we touched down it kept very still about 300 feet from us.  We pulled up to the hanger door; jumped out, even left the charts in the plane, quickly put the plane in, we did it so fast we broke the taillight from the top of the tail.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was absolutely no noise coming from the bright light and we were close enough to have heard any noise from it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Jumped in the El Camino and drove as fast as we could to the highway; he started to turn north towards home and I screamed &#34;No don&#39;t go that way it&#39;s deserted; go toward town&#34;.  He turned south and by the time we came into downtown Plymouth we were going almost 100 mph.  He said &#34;Where ((three words deleted)) are the police when you need them?&#34;   Trees had kept us from being able to see the &#34;light&#34; because they are all along on both sides of the street.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was able to see that it was following us until we went under the trees.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I couldn&#39;t get him to go inside the police station and he wouldn&#39;t let me go in.  He refused to report it to the FAA and made me promise not to talk about it.  He said he didn&#39;t want anyone thinking he was nuts.  He died Jan of 05.<n> <n><n> <n><n> To this day I have a spooky feeling if I go near there; and will not go at night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

At the time I was in the 5th grade and my sister was in first. We had spent all night driving up there in our Grandparents Gremlin (I think) one of those vehicles with the big hatch backs. We arrived in the middle of the night and our parents chose to leave us sleeping in the back rather than bring us in. I remember waking up to a very bright blinking light and waking my sister up to tell her I thought maybe Dad was outside swinging a lantern or something. I sat up to look and saw this huge light. It was shaped long and oval sort of like a saucer, hovering between  our two barns. It no longer blinked, but glowed like a giant light bulb. I immediately yelled for my sister to look. She becamed very frightened. We layed down and held on to each other until we woke up in the morning. We told out parents and our Mom told us how she had seen a bright light, but didn&#39;t think anything of it until know she realized the house is about 1/2 mile from the road with nothing behind it, but woods for miles. We defintely experienced something very UFO like that night and still wonder about it today.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

I was out with my telescope around two in the morning and about ready to call it a night when I noticed a star directly overhead.  It was not especially bright but I knew that it did not belong in that constellation of stars.  As I looked at the constellation and was telling myself that it didn&#39;t belong, it grew brighter and brighter.  It did not move at all; it just got brighter.  It came to a point when it was brighter than any other star in the sky, which made me think I was about to get nailed in the face by a meteor. You know what they say; if it ain&#39;t moving, it&#39;s coming straight for you.  So, you&#39;re saying to yourself, big deal! That&#39;s around the time of the Persied (maybe Leonid, I forget) meteor shower. I know that and I know what meteors look like.  Well, the best part was that , as I watched for the impact, the light sent out about 5 or 6 dimmer lights in quick succession, one at a time, in separate directions.  In fact, it seemed as if they shot out in a perfectly geometrical design.  The little lights moved off in straight lines then the central light that first drew my attention started going dim.  It grew dimmer and dimmer until I could no longer make it out.  It never moved laterally.  I figure something came into the atmosphere straight down over me, let smaller craft loose, then went vertically back out of the atmosphere.

While traveling north on the Saint Marie road just outside of Olney, my brother and I noticed three bright orange fireballs in a triangular pattern moving up and down extremely rapidly in a zig zag pattern. The fire balls stayed together in the triangular pattern at all times. They were no more than 1/4 mile west of us, moving at least 500 feet up and down within a second or two.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We contacted our parents on our CB radio to ask them if they were watching what we were. They were watching it, too. Within a minute, the triangular fire balls dipped one last time behind a grove of trees and disappeared.

I took our black Labrador, Kahlua, out for her nightly beach walk. We started up the sand dune trail toward the beach, when suddenly(and for the first time ever) my seven year old dog pointed toward the beach end of the path and her backhair was standing up.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I looked and saw a glimmer of shimmering light and figured she had sensed some neighbors sitting around a bon fire on the beach. I took a brisk walk with her to the end of the path, and upon reaching the beach overlook, I stood dumbfounded.  There were NO people on the beach but off to our left(West) and approaching  us at a slow speed were three glowing spheres of strange light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I looked down at Kahlua and she was following these objects and didn&#39;t move.  (She was not leashed) They were about 5 feet above the shore where the small waves were meeting the sand.I could see the foam of the small wavelets illuminated by the spheres ,directly below them. They were in an echelon formation (like jets fly off each others wing tips). One sphere was ahead of the other two and they were each off to one side and behind the lead sphere.  Their surfaces were of a yellow/pink static light that ran around the globes like little lightning bolts but thin and many.  It was very quiet ,except for the breeze rushing past our ears off the lake.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I remember seeing lightning way across the lake near Chicago (which you can see the taller buildings on a clear day).It was miles away and barely saw the lightning.  These globes were about 3- 4 feet in diameter and a few feet apart and moved Eastward directly in front of us.  That&#39;s when I got a good look.The static surface gave me a good view of their outlines and they were perfect globes. I got goosebumps and hair must&#39;ve stood on my arms. I pinched myself to make sure I wasn&#39;t dreaming.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Kahlua never moved except for her head while staring at these spheres with me.The globes kept moving and seemed to speed up and we watched until they became a single light (due to distance) and they disappeared downshore as they moved out of sight toward New Buffalo,Michigan.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I often wonder why I and/or Kahlua never walked or ran closer to see these at close range?  It seemed I didn&#39;t want to move. I was afraid.I had lived and walked this beach for at least 1 year and never saw anything as puzzling as this. The globes were controlled and never wavered once in their flight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I reported the sighting to the Michigan City Police the next day but they just laughed and said it was probably &#34;airplane lights&#34;. No way...not 80 -100 feet in front of me along the breaking waves and illuminating the foam only.  I sent this report at the time, to Dr. J. Allen Hynek at Northwestern Univ. but never heard anything more.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;m a blue collar worker with some collage and was sober and wide awake at the time. I also knew the beach area at night since I lived just a few minutes walk from the water&#39;s edge and spent much of my my free time there.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Question: Has anyone else reported close encounters with lights,spheres, or otherwise along the beaches of Lake Michigan ?? Thank you for letting me report this unknown.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date is approximate.  We have heard many such reports of luminous spheres.  PD))<n>

It hoovered quickly and swift, colorful lights at bottom<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was 17 years old, it was the summer of 1977. A male friend and I went over to Lake Chabot,it was late about 3:00 AM. We stood at the deck which overlooked the lake. Mountains surround the area and it is lit by the moonlight. It was very peaceful and pleasant, no one was out at this time of night. I remember feeling safe with guy friend, then suddenly from behind the mountain, a huge, maybe 100&#39; wide flying saucer hovered into the valley like area, almost like it was hiding. It made a very swift humming sound and took over the sky. There were colorful lights twinkling on the bottom of the saucer. I was amazed, I looked over to my friend and he started running and left me there! I realized then how dark it was. The saucer had taken up the sky and the moonlight. I couldn&#39;t see the road which would lead me back up to the car. Oh my god, this guy left me! I said &#34;Wait&#34;!. Luckily, I found my way up the hill by memory, for have often visited Lake Chabot. There he was, my so called friend, taking off in his car. I was able catch him. He was very frighten, where I was more amazed. We went back to my house to share it with my roomate and she thought we were on drugs. Well, we weren&#39;t. We talked alone out in front of my house for a few miniutes, then he left. I haven&#39;t seen him since. I don&#39;t even remember his name. Hopefully, one day he will read this and want to contact me. If he is reading this, please place an add, do something, come find me. I would like to talk about that night, plus I will have proof, that I did see what I saw. I am not one to make up things, I have no reason to do this. I keep telling my children and family, &#34;Come on.... do you really think I would make something like this up&#34; and they say no, but find it hard to believe in UFOs. Well, that&#39;s my story and honest to God, I did see a flying saucer.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

I was 13 or 14 years old, visiting mineapolis from california for the summer.  the year was 1976 - 78,  can pinpoint the year by talking to relatives if needed.  the month was July or August and the day was a tuesday. my favorite show baa baa black sheep was on tv at the time.  we reported it to the police dept. they laughed?

8/10/77 01:00|Hazard|KY|Light|5 hours?|Probable abduction|8/12/08|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/064/S64971.html|18|ndxe197708| Probable abduction<n> <n><n> <n><n> Not exactly sure as to date but certain on month and year. My girlfriend and I were exploring the backroads and small towns of the Appalachias and camping out of the back of my 1970 VW Squareback station wagon. It slept two quite nicely. And I&#39;m 6&#39;4&#34;. We were a couple of hippie kids in our early twenties and I had found a dirt road off of US 421 at about 7:00pm as it was still daylight. This road had a lot of switchbacks and it was mainatined by Ashland Oil Company as we had seen multiple signs along this dirt road. I drove off of US 421 for approximately 15 miles and up to an elevation that might have been several hundred feet higher than where I had turned onto the dirt road. I stopped beneath a beautiful rock cliff that stretched about 100&#39; above where I&#39;d parked. The cliff was due east and a thickly forrested and very steep drop off was to our west. The car was oriented front facing north. We got our Hibachi out and cooked a couple small steaks and some veggies on it and hand about a third of a bottle of red wine between the two of us. We sat and talked as it got dark and we could make out a narrow band of sky and stars above us but most of the sky was no visible due to the cliff and the trees. At about 10:00 pm we decided to call it a night and settled into the VW for a good night&#39;s sleep. It was warm but nice and the sky was clear the humidity was low and there were no bugs so it was a beautiful night for sleeping. We had the hatch open on the VW with the rear seats folded down and the front seats folded forward as to aloow as much length for stretching out as possible so I would say that my feet were probably about 6&#34;-10&#34; inside the car and my girlfriend was on my right side.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I woke up and only could open my eyes but could not move. There was a LOT of brilliant blue white light (like an electric arc welder only more) shining into the car from BELOW our elevation, coming up the steep slope to the west. I could tell that it was from that origin due to the light shining onto the ceiling of the car and not down into the car. I must have been on my right side as I could see the VDO dash clock and it said it was about 1:00 am.  I should not have been able to see that clock as we were in the middle of nowhere and it had been pitch dark when we turned off the dome light at 10:00.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Sometime later a awoke again and this time I was lying on my back which struck me as odd as I had never slept on my back. I was looking at the headliner of the car and all I do was move my eyes.  There was a very even blue white light illuminating the inside of the car at this point but it was not very bright.  As I looked to my left I could see the B-Pillar moving away from my field of vision and I realized that I was moving out of the back of the car, flat on my back, unable to move.  I had the very definite sensation that there was something/someone moving around outside the rear of the car.  I immediatley thought &#39;bears&#39;.  I remember struggling to move but all I could do was move my eyes and the last thing I remembered was seeing the inside of the hatch window glide by and out of sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The next morning was very strange as my girlfriend and I barely talked, tossed our stuff into the VW and drove to the nearest town in search of a restroom with plenty of cold water to splash on.  We made it to Hazard Kentucky and there was a little festival going on in town.  When I found a restaraunt I went to the men&#39;s room and immediately noticed that I had about four days beard growth when I had shaved just 24 hours before.  My girlfriend was in even worse shape as she had started her period just the day before and she said that she was a &#34;mess&#34;.  We both felt as though we had been drugged as we were kind of woozy and I remember pain in my neck and lower back and she reported pain as well.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We didn&#39;t really talk much about that experience for the next six years.  We were married for five of those years and the experience only came up once or twice.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thirteen years later in Bloomington,Indiana I was reading a book by Whitly Streiber and another book about abductions that I just happened upon at the county library and I flipped to the photos in the center of the book and there were B&amp;W photos of &#34;scoop marks&#34; on people&#39;s shins/lower legs. I about dropped the book because I knew that I had three perfectly proportioned scars on my right leg that were perfect matches to the photos I was looking at. I had know for years that I had these scars but I had never really questioned their origin.... That struck me as really weird because I can account for every little scar on my carcass but not these. And they are deep and would have been into the bone based on their dimensions.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;ve seen floating, dimly lit orbs once before this event when I was about ten and once after when I was about twenty-eight. That&#39;s pretty much it.....<n> <n><n> <n><n> I worked in high energy accelerator physics for about seventeen years after this event and I felt that it was possibly some sort of abduction event even though I was immersed daily in hard scientific facts.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Feel free to contact me only if you feel that I may be of help to you.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.

I and some friends were at a Drive-In movie located in the town of 29 Palms outside the base. It was pretty late at night. The movie screen was located about 5 feet away on the other side of 5&#39; high wooden fence that surrounded the parking area. I just happened to look off to the upper right hand side of the screen and noticed that something was hovering, with multi-colored blinking lights, above a darkened building, about a mile away on the outskirts of town. (29 Palms, CA) I thought to myself, &#39;What the heck is a helicopter doing hovering over a building out in town&#39;? I was used to seeing all kinds of helicopters on the base.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I then noticed that it continued to hover, there was no sound or sand being kicked up. It appeared to be a ball of multi-colored blinking lights. I couldn&#39;t discern a shape. I absent mindedly started walking towards the fence to get a better look. I then noticed that many other people in the Drive-In saw it too and got out of their cars. The UFO then started to rise straight up, silently. It did not flair out at an angle like a helicopter would. It kept going up until it appeared to be the size and color of a star. It then started zig-zagging across the sky while still going up, until it finally disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I found out later that at the same time, people located on the other side (to the left of the screen) of the drive-in area, saw two UFO&#39;s hovering over a mountain, located to the left of the screen. They reported that the 2 UFO&#39;s they saw, also rose straight up, silently, and zig-zagged while going up until they were out of site. I thought to myself, &#39;I have to call the Base and tell someone!&#39; But I didn&#39;t have any idea as to who to call. We all talked about it the next day. I called a friend, who now lives in N. Carolina, after 25 years and he still remembered the incident.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date of incident may be approximate, although the witness does not indicate that fact.  PD))<n>

Making right turns.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My sister, a male friend and I were going down a dirt road near interstate 11 in Jefferson, Ohio in August of 1977. I know it was 1977 because my son was a three months old, and was also in the car. I was looking up at the sky and saw an object that was making right turns and I thought that planes cannot do that. After watching it for a minute, I told my sister to stop the car and we got out. The thing pivoted back and flew right over us. It was not very high in the sky and it had flashing red, blue, and white lights on the corners. It was triangle shaped. We could see a slow moving propeller on the bottom. We could hear a slight hum. It kept zigzagging and headed east. There was a moon that night and we saw it clear as day. I never reported it until I ran across this website and saw a picture if it. I still dream about it thirty years later.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.  PD))<n>

The object drifted over the city from the SW to NE.  It had the shape of a cigar box. or a shoe box. It looked metalic.  I recall thinking that it looked like a large floating heat duct and could not reconcile what I was seeing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It had no lights, no sound (but it was at a distance), and no apparent propulsion.  It drifted over a bank of clouds that I would estimate to be higher than two or  three thousand feet.  It may have had a &#34;X&#34; marking faintly visible on its underside.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This did not fit the flying saucer image. It must have been quite large, perhaps twice as large as a box car or larger.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was an Air Force Pilot at the time and did not report it for fear of some form of reprisials or ridicule. I saw it from the ground one evening while I was at home  I later asked quietly if there was someone who took such reports.  I was directed to a Lt. Col. who was quite open about other reports that he had been given but he said he had not heard of one of my description.  He said that none of the reports that he had heard amounted to anything other than unprovable observations and usually just lights.   His role on base was informal apparently.  I asked quietly among the other pilots over coffee etc. whether anyone was seeing anything and most said no.<n> <n><n> <n><n> One said that they had been &#34;paced&#34; by a light once and one reported seeing a &#34;sacucer&#34; over a lake at home.  The pilots/aircrew were interested but apparently not seeing anything.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I report this now years later as I am surprised that rectangles have been seen by others.

Next thing I can remember is being floated down my front stairway, out the front door, up and over my neighbors yard, then I would be standing in a gas station parking lot in the next town over. It was a 76 gas station, which is now a Citgo, located on the westbound side of Saltonstall Parkway in East Haven, CT. This little grey alien, classic description(grey,large head w/large black eyes and very skinny) would play with me and tell me to come with him. All i can remember is refusing to go, then being back in bed, seeing the alien wave goodbye and fly off in the ufo.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Since this time, i&#39;ve only had one other sighting which was about 2 yrs ago. I stopped at roy rogers on washington ave in N.Haven CT to get breakfast about 7:30 am. When i came out of the restaurant, somthing in the sky was reflecting off the morning sun. i looked up and immediately seen the classic disc shaped silver ufo hovering way up in the sky. I knew what it was immediatly. I looked away and then back at it a couple of times to make sure my eyes wern&#39;t bugging out. I watched it move back, forward and side to side in an erratic manner. It was there for about 10 minutes then just dissapeared into thin air.<n>

8/4/77 20:45|Scarborough (Canada)|ON|Other|15-20 mins|Pear shaped silver craft with wheel of colours close encounter|8/7/07|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/057/S57388.html|27|ndxe197708| Pear shaped silver craft with wheel of colours close encounter<n> <n><n> <n><n> On the night of Aug.4,1977, while working outside at the location of Neilson Rd. and Ellesmere.I worked at Dominion Stores,serving cars for grocery pick-up.  A fellow parked along side the field in the parking lot asked &#34;look at the object over there-what is it&#34;?  I looked and said,it&#39;s a plane while I served a customer.The next car pulled up for p/u for groceries.The stranger said look,it&#39;s not moving-I looked and said -it&#39;s a helicopter.I finished the second car and again this fellow bothered me. Again saying look at the lights on it while staying inside his car ? At that moment I had no more customers to serve-so now I had FULL attention of what this fellow was asking about,in what to identify.Clearly,about a little over a mile-directly east bordering Westhill and Scarborough,Ont. -east of Morningside Rd..I could see a wheel of colours rotating clockwise at a very low altitude-just above tree tops.The fellow stayed inside his car,and I put my head down and ran across the field about 200 yds.I then stopped,to look a mile away to the east, with my workplace behind me.I looked and noticed it was gone from where I first saw it.I checked across the sky and looked behind me.I was in shock as I turned to the west.Just above me-off 10 degrees-- about 50 ft.away and 200 ft above in the sky-was a silver craft.I could not believe what I was witnessing at age 18.The description was a silver light bulb/capsule shaped craft.The larger back end facing me,had four distinct colours of light-in sequence blue-green-yellow-red.These lights rotated clockwise -one at a time.Inside the center of the perimeter of these four lights -a slightly larger orangey-yellow light that stayed on.There were no marks on this grayish silver craft-like one mould.This thing had no sound,and appeared 40-50 ft in length.Small end about 10 ft in diameter to the back about 30 ft in diameter.I watched this craft and light for about 15-20 mins.I felt at the time they were time travellers and shouted for them to come down, pointing t! o the gr ound.I felt the word Neanderthal and bone density pop into my mind.I could not await any longer to stand alone-I wanted to get some other witnesses to this marvel.I ran very fast back towards the store.As soon as I reached the edge of the parking lot,I heard a four pitch &#34;beeping&#34; sound.I dead stopped and turned around.The craft was moving very slow[5 mph] toward the northwest,and making the beeping sounds.The fellow who brought this to my attention was gone-nowhere.I ran into the store to have a co-worker friend witness this thing.He was unloading a 45 foot trailer of groceries-he could not.I run fast back through the store to go outside again.I screamed for a co-worker who collects grocery carts,to run over here.The craft was about less than a mile northwest of us-still flying very low and beeping.After a minute it was out of sight.This co-worker asked me,&#34;what is it&#34; ? I replied time travellers! We stayed together and look all around in the skies.After 10 minutes we went back to work.The store would be closing at 10:00pm,as it must have been 9:15pm at that point.Then I heard a whooshing sound directly above moving across to the east.My co-worker friend screamed across the parking lot and say-did you hear that ! I noticed a very low[1000-2000 ft] white trail-east to west -like a jet trail Again we both stood together at the edge of the field and witnessed a bright red and white light.Directly east about 10 miles,high in the sky.We watched the intensity of a red,then bright white shining on and off for a couple of minutes.Then suddenly,it went out and reappered south -near Lake Ontario.The location would be Pickering Ontario-where we watched at out vantage point in location.This light shined brightly on and off a white to red colour for another couple of minutes.Then it was over-but never forgotten of what it was I had witnessed.It is important for me to report this to you David.From 1967-2002 I have seen 9 ufo&#39;s in the month of August.But in 2003,all that changed.I had witnessed 16 more sightings start! ing Marc h 3,2003.IN TOTAL OVER 80 SIGHTINGS TO PRESENT**** JULY 2007.I have started to photograph them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  One of several reports submitted by same source.

8/1/77 23:30|Washburn|TN|Chevron|2-3 min|slow moving chevron or "V" shaped object  with strobes and silent|2/14/08|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/061/S61482.html|28|ndxe197708| slow moving chevron or &#34;V&#34; shaped object  with strobes and silent<n> <n><n> <n><n> My wife and I were returning home from Knoxville sometime around midnight. We were living out in the country on top of a knoll surrounded by cleared open pasture land. The night dark and overcast but not raining and no stars were visible.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As we exited the car and started walking to the house something caused me to look up. I then spotted the lights on a vehicle passing directly above us. These strobe lights were in a “V” configuration that began at the lead point and traveled down the leading edge of both wings simultaneously.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object was quite large or quite low as it took up a large section of the sky above us but we were not able to accurately judge this due to the weather conditions that night that did not provide any stars behind it to outline the size and shape of it nor were there any ground lights to illuminate it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As we watched, this object made a slow turn to the south towards Knoxville and moved out of sight. At no time did we hear any noise from this object or any other lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have wondered about this for years now and have tried to debunk the experience as being a plane or a balloon but as yet can not. This object when spotted was traveling in an east to westerly direction and performed a slow 90 degree bank to the south.  It was moving at speed that would cause a commercial aircraft to stall and too large to be completely silent. We would have at least heard the air flowing across the wings and/or control surfaces. If it had been a balloon then we would have heard the engine as it moved southward.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD))<n>

(My dad was a Retired Air force Colonel) and had been a pilot for 30 years.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My dad and I watched the object as it approached and as it got closer and passed overhead it presented itself as 5 seperate white lights in a triangular shape.  It flew a steady heading and there was no sound whatsover.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It is unlike any object that I have ever seen in the sky, it appeared to be low (2 or 3 thousand) but it really is impossible to tell at night.  But if it was much higher, then what doesnt make sense is how it appeared when I first saw it appear on the horizon...at that time it looked just like a large jetliner does when it is coming right at you with its landing lights on.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Several other neighboors watched it pass over, and while it was not spectacular, it was certainely unusual, and it did not have any red or green navigation lights, just white lights in a triangle shape.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This has bothered me ever since I saw it, and because I am a constant sky watcher, I have seen aircraft of every possible size and shape in all kinds of weather conditions.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

8/1/77 19:00|Fairfield|CT|Other|30 seconds|In my youth, my friend and I witnessed an inverted, glowing teacup hovering over Fairfield University campus.|12/2/13|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/104/S104908.html|31|ndxe197708| In my youth, my friend and I witnessed an inverted, glowing teacup hovering over Fairfield University campus.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;m sorry I don&#39;t remember the exact dates or even year, as this happened over 30 years ago, but I do remember exactly what I saw.  I was in the back seat of my parent&#39;s car along with my childhood friend Raymond, and we were driving from my house to my Uncle and Aunt&#39;s house.  We were driving past the SW corner of the Fairfield University campus, and for some reason Raymond and I were looking out the back window, up at the sky.  Maybe it was because a few days earlier we&#39;d also seen something that caught our eye up in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was just before dusk, and the sky was beginning to darken.  Hovering over the corner of the campus was a glowing object, pale yellow.  It had a shallow convex bottom, and the top was an inverted teacup shape.  For some reason it seemed to be spinning clockwise, while there was a ring of green and red lights that made up a belt where the top and bottom of the object met.  This ring of lights moved in a counter clockwise direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It just hovered there, maybe about the size of half dollar or dollar coin from our perspective.  I have no idea how high up in the sky it was.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We sat in silence and watched this object as we drove past.  When the car turned left at the corner, we watched until it was out of sight.  We then turned to one another to confirm that we both just witnessed the same thing.  Raymond confirmed what he saw, and neither of us thought to mention it to my parents.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD))<n>
8/1/77 16:00|Pleasenton|CA|Disk|10 min.s|They were not  from this planet, man just doesn;t have the technoigy to fly that fast.  Besides we fly airplanes not sausers|3/11/06|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/049/S49326.html|32|ndxe197708| They were not  from this planet, man just doesn;t have the technoigy to fly that fast.  Besides we fly airplanes not sausers<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was a 17 year old young man when I had my encounter. I lived in Fremont Ca. It was a hot August day in 1977. I wanted to get out of the house, so I called up couple of girl that I knew and asked them if they wanted to go for a ride. They said yes. So I went and picked them up. I decided to take them to a place where I knew about. It was outside of Pleasenton Ca.  There was a abby where these monks lived. These monks had painted a bridge. It was done in different seens. They were seens from 1776 thru 1976. They were very beutiful, and I knew it would impress the girls. So I took the girls there and they were impressed. When we were done we drove to the end of the road. Theres a parking lot over looking a small lake. I shut off my motor and got some beers out of the trunk of my car. When I got back into the car I gave the girls a beer and cracked one open for myself. As soon as I looked back up, there it was. I couldn&#39;t beleive what I was seeing. It was a disk flying like nothing I&#39;d ever seen. I grew up flying with my friends dad. We got to fly once a month. So the first thing I noticed was there was no sound. This disk was changing colors and had a haze around it. It was hovering over the far end of the lake and then it would fly off. When it flew off it was at about a 45 degree angle. It seem to go around ten miles away. then in a blink of an eye, it was back over the lake. I apeared to change shapes right before my eyes. I couldn&#39;t understand what I was seeing. Needless to say, I was scared ((word deleted)). I wanted to look over at the girls and see if they were looking, but I was afraid it would fly away. So I didn&#39;t look over. I just asked them if they were seeing what I was seeing, and they replied I hope so. I asked them if they were seeing a flying sauser. They said yes. That really scared me too. I think part of me was hoping they weren&#39;t seeing this flying sauser. My brain was working overtime. I had never seen anything like it before so I didn&#39;t know what to do. As I kept watching this sauser it was flying back and forth around the lake. Then another sauser appeared. About 1 min. later a third sauser appeared. It was really stange, it was like they just appeared. We watched them for about another min. then one of the suaser flew right over to where we were parked. It stopped around 50 yards from us. Now it was hovering right in front of us. I was trying to move but couldn&#39;t. I was frozen with fright. We were looking right at them, and I felt like they were looking right at us at us. It felt like an hour, but was only about 15 sec. Then it flew over to west end of the lake. We watched them for a couple of more min.s. I not sure what they were doing there. But when they finally left it was the most amazing thing. All three sausers flew of to the west. they flew around 5 miles at a 45 degree angle. Now this is a little hard to exsplain. But they all three seem to fly in the same spot, and then they flew off as 1 sauser. It left a trail when it left. When it left it was so fast, it looked like a shooting star. I&#39;ve seen the trooth flying aroud out there. I&#39;m now 46 years old. And I&#39;ll never forget what I saw. At the time in 1977, the girls and myself decided to sware secretsy. We were afraid if anyone found out what we saw, they would think we were crazy.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.  PD))<n>

Over time I had forgotten about it.  To the point of not even my wife of 14 years knew it. I am a retired Army lieutenant Colonel.<n>
8/1/77 02:00|Whittier|CA|Chevron|10 min.|Very large metallic object hovering over 605 freeway|12/2/00|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/015/S15000.html|34|ndxe197708| Very large metallic object hovering over 605 freeway<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am new to the web and immediately wanted to find a site wherein I could share my experience and hopefully find someone who may have witnessed what I saw early one morning, or documentation of such.  I apologize for being so vague on the specific date; it&#39;s been so long ago.  But the actual experience is still very vivid in my mind and something I will never forget.  To the best of my recollection it was 1977, but may have been 1978.  I do know it was approx. 2:30 in the morning, as I had left my boyfriend&#39;s house in Downey and was traveling northbound on the 605 freeway heading for the 210 freeway.  I was not under the influence of any substance.  As I was traveling northbound on the 605, just past Rose Hills Memorial Park, I saw something ahead of me hovering over the freeway.  Being very familiar with that area, I knew the incredibly large object I was approaching did not belong there - had never been there before.  That particular part of the freeway was very desolate - nothing in the way of commercial buildings, etc.  Just a duck farm to the west and Rose Hills to the southeast.It was within close proximity to the 60 freeway as well.  I recall virtually no other traffic at that time as I neared the object.  It was hovering, completely still, maybe about 500 feet above the freeway.  I slowed as I approaced it, looking at it in disbelief.  When I was under it, I came to a complete stop on the freeway and just stared in amazement.  It was incredibly huge - like something from Battlestar Gallactica.  It wasn&#39;t shiny, but was metallick with circular indents - like pores - about it.  It was a very peculiar shape-nothing you could describe as a definate rectangle, circle, etc.  It has many configurations.  But the size just overwhelmed me.  I remember not feeling frightened, but just astounded.  I sat there for awhile just staring at this thing, oblivious to my surroundings or the fact that I was sitting still on the freeway.  I couldn&#39;t tell you if another car came along or not.  As I slowly began to p! ul away, I kept my eye on it, continually looking back, and then it was gone.  I&#39;ve always wondered if someone else may have reported a similar experience, or if there was documentation of unusual activity in that vicinity in &#39;77 or &#39;78.  It has disturbed me for more than 20 years (I am now  45), and I was hoping someone could substantiate it for me.  Thank you for allowing me to share this with you.  I look forward to the possibity of perhaps finding out more.<n>
