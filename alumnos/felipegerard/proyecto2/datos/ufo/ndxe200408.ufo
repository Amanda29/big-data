I thought it was a satellite at first because of its slow speed. I often spot satellites at this time of night traveling slowly across the sky, but never one this bright, and I have always watched them travel for several minutes. My next thought was a meteor, but it was traveling slower than any meteor I have ever seen. It got very bright in intensity for about 5 seconds and then faded very fast, moving through about ten or 20 degrees of the night sky. I have never seen a meteor travel this slow, nor have I seen a satellite this bright and short. It was much more intense than most meteors. What really grabbed my attention was another object of the same intensity followed the exact same path about three minutes later. Could this have been pieces of space junk burning up? I&#39;m not sure, but it didn&#39;t look like anything I&#39;ve ever seen in the sky before.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We suspect the &#34;flare&#34; of reflected sunlight from Iridium satellite #34.

With binoculars I could see three seperate lights on this object.  I observed this object from my back yard right on Lake Erie.  The object was West of me moving East. Today (Wed) I told a co-worker, he said that he and another worker observed the same object from my place of employement which is about 15 miles South of my location.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have read that this object was an atlas missle, however, the missle launch site and projected path of travel is over the Atlantic ocean, no where over Lake Erie???<n>

At first I thought it was the moon behind a cloud but I realized the sky was clear with many stars and the moon was just rising in the eastern sky.  It looked like a very small cloud with a light behind it.  I could not make out any shape but was aware it was drifting very slowly directly east.  Went to get a pair of binoculars and my wife and son.  Through the binoculars there was a distinct shape with a more pronounced light shooting south out of one of five arms (for lack of a better word).  The shape looked almost like a starfish with four of the arms evenly distibuted and then a fifth arm protruding south with the light coming out of it.  This shape could only be made out while looking through the binoculars and the entire object faded out of sight as it drifted directly overhead into the brighter sky (the sky gets bright to the east of my house due to a mall to the east).  It was odd that the light seemed to be facing out of the object like a headlight on a vehicle but yet the object was moving or probably just drifting to the east.  My wife and son observed the same exact thing.  It was visible for about 30 minutes.  Really curious if anyone else in eastern Ohio observed this.  It was not very bright and looked like a cloud with a light in or behind it, but maintained a very distinct starfish shape as it drifted/moved which I do not think a cloud would have done.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Result of earlier missile launch.

It had numerous bright non-flashing white lights as well as a flashing red light. The flashing red light was not consistent. There was no noticeable noise and the craft turned 180 degrees towards the SW and accelerated rapidly out of sight. My fiance who was with me at the time has flown planes and this did not look like a plane or helicopter to him. Im sure that due to the traffic on 33 at the time and because of how clear the night sky was with a full moon and no clouds that there were many others who witnessed this. I would also like to add that while on my cell phone i was disconnected and the person i was talking to head beeping noises over the line.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

At first, I didnt really pay any attention to it, but then I noticed it looked funny. It was hovering over some trees off to the right of the highway, then as I came up upon it, it darted over the highway into the field off to my left. As I drove up, I put my window down to see if I could hear anything such as rotor blades if it was a helicopter or engines if it was a plane. But, nothing! The object was triangular in shape, a white/blue light on each end of the triangle, and in the middle, it had a red light, that flashed white around it, almost like a strobe light. I had pulled off to the side of the road like an idiot, but I wanted to know exactly what I was looking at! Not to much traffic either on the highway that night, so it was pretty quiet outside! Very strange to say the least, hopefully someone else near and around ft. wayne saw this object as well! 2nd time in as many months that Ive seen a strange object around ft. wayne, this is the first time Ive reported one though!<n>

I decided since there were no mosquitos evident to sit on the front porch. It was a beautiful clear sky and the full moon hadn&#39;t come up yet. I could see many stars above and since we do not live in the city, the lights of the stars were clear.  I could see the glow of the lights of the city of Belleville to the south of us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At approx 9:10pm I noticed a strange orangy object on the Western horizon above the hill to the northwest of us.  I called my husband out to see this as this object was moving towards our house and it was bigger than any plane I have seen.  He came out and viewed the object in the sky.  Then went inside to get his binoculars.  When he came out and viewed the object with the binoculars he noticed its unusual shape.<n> <n><n> <n><n> &#34;I determined that it was shaped like a snow angel with a pointed head, that is it was an elongated object with four fan-like projections at its sides.  The pointed head had a blinking light.  As it approached its colour changed to white.&#34;  We then called our son out to view this object in the sky.  He confirmed the same shape that we had both observed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was moving from west to east and heading right over our house.  All three of us viewed this object coming towards the house and its shape and size.  It seemed to be  a glowing cloud with a flashing light.  The &#39;angel&#39; shape was glowing and you could see stars through it.  However at the &#39;pointed&#39; end you could not see stars through it.  We also noted 5-6 aircraft all heading the same direction around the object.  Some did appear to be circling the object.  The object was considerably larger than any of these planes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Approximately 9:15pm-9:20pm, the objects light stopped blinking.  But, the cloud &#39;angel&#39; continued to move towards our house (easterly).<n> <n><n> <n><n> At this point (approx 9:25pm) Gordon went back into the house.  My son and I stayed out to watch this object.  It was now almost directly over the house.  I had the binoculars and watched as a bright circular orangey-yellow object flew out of the cloud.  This object was about the size of 1/4 of the full moon.  The object headed directly north at a much faster speed than the cloud had been moving.  The object appeared to be about 1/8 the size of the full moon when it reached the stars that make up the Big Dipper. It reached that position in the sky in about 30 seconds.  The object then turned 90 degrees and headed back west.  It disappeared moments later.  The cloud disappeared within 5 minutes of the object leaving it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> All planes then seemed to have left the vicinity when we looked for them again after the object disappeared. All the ones we had observed around this object that is.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It should be noted here that at no time did we hear any noise from this object.

8/31/04 21:10|Bellefonte|PA|Other|15 minutes|An odd, luminous cloud over Central PA    ((NUFORC Note:  Result of earlier missile launch.  PD))|9/1/04|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/039/S39015.html|13|ndxe200408| An odd, luminous cloud over Central PA<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is the sort of sighting that I&#39;m sure has a rational explanation... I&#39;d just like to know what it is.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Tonight my girlfriend and I were leaving our apartment in Bellefonte PA and heading towards State College, about 15 minutes away. As we topped a hill, we noticed an odd disturbance in the sky. I thought at first that it was the twin landing lights of an airplane, flying through thin clouds (there are numerous flight paths over central PA). There were two elongated, grey-white luminous bands, surrounded by a gently glowing white haze, something like this:  . . . . . .<n> <n><n> <n><n> . . === . === . .<n> <n><n> <n><n> . . . . . .<n> <n><n> <n><n> where == are the bands and the periods are the haze. Anyway, I thought it was an airplane over some clouds. But I soon realized that it didn&#39;t appear to be moving. It was not very bright, and it reminded my girlfriend of a comet. Indeed, aside from the funky geometry, it DID look like a very bright comet (like a milky star, as Hale-Bopp looked, at its brightest magnitude, for example). But unlike a comet, it was moving very slowly across the sky (we parked the car to watch, and I tracked its movement against a church steeple). It moved from the southwest to the northeast, roughly, and its speed resembled that of a slow cloud: perhaps one degree of sky per minute. Several planes flew overhead during this time, and I was able to compare them both in terms of motion and appearance. There was no resemblence at all. The object was gray and nebulous; the planes were clear and their red and green lights were perfectly visible. Stars were also visible overhead and all around the object; although there were clouds on the horizon, the sky above was very clear.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As we watched the object for approximately three minutes, it very slowly began to disperse and fade. The parallel luminous bands became splotches, and finally the whole thing degenerated into a slightly luminous cloud approximately the visible size of my thumb held at arm&#39;s length.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The past-full moon was just rising, though it was mostly obscured by clouds to the south east. Those clouds and the moon were purple and yellow, generally, and I did not have the impression that the object was illuminated by moonlight (though I can&#39;t be sure). As the object faded and became more cloudlike, we drove to a darker spot to watch it, which we did for perhaps another 8 minutes. I telephoned by brother in Louisiana, and asked him if he could see it (I was hoping to decide if the object was in space, in orbit, or in the atmosphere). He could not see it, but reported strong light pollution.<n> <n><n> <n><n> By this time, the object had faded to the point that I would not have noticed it, had I not been looking. It was still perhaps 10 degrees from directly overhead and very dim, visible to the west and drifting east. My girlfriend and I continued our trip to State College, and when we arrived, clouds obscured the sky. The clouds cleared perhaps 20 minutes later, and there was no trace left of the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have no reason to believe this was anything other than some odd weather or astronomical phenomena, but neither of us has ever seen anything like it. Any ideas?<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Result of earlier missile launch.

I first noticed the object relatively low and distant in the sky as I looked to the west-southwest. It appeared well above the treeline as a white, somewhat fuzzy, oval-shaped splotch in the sky, about the size of an aspirin at arm&#39;s length. After staring at it for a full minute, it also seemed to be moving extremely slowly toward me. As a lifelong stargazer and skywatcher, it caught my attention due to its relatively large size, its relative brightness in the night sky, and the fact that, for me, if didn&#39;t fit any category of previously observed aerial phenomena.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I yelled to my wife and grabbed two optics -- an 8x20 monocular and 16x50 binoculars. By this time we were certain that the object was slowly moving toward us. As I viewed it for at least 15 minutes through the 16x binoculars, it never changed its shape from the one shown in the sketch I previously referenced -- its appearance was that of two large, equal-sized parabolic shapes that were back to back but slightly separated and linked through their middles by a somewhat cigar-shaped element that was slightly pointier at the left (south-facing) end. These shapes appeared to be gaseous, almost cloudlike in nature, but they were sufficiently defined and unchanging.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I looked through the 16x binoculars, I also saw an occasionally-blinking white light at the left tip of the cigar-shaped central element. It blinked at an  irregular rate, and my wife could not see this aspect of it through the 8x monocular. At one point midway through our roughly 15-minute observation period, I also saw (through the binoculars) a yellow-red dot that moved quickly toward the south; it originated from the same tip where the white light was periodically blinking. I could only track the low-intensity yellow-red light briefly through the binoculars&#39; field of view before it vanished; I could not see this light with my naked eye.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The dual-parabolic-shaped object&#39;s line of travel took it directly over my house at a high altitude. As it slowly approached the point directly overhead, the object also had begun to lose its shape, size, and intensity of luminosity. When it was directly overhead, the object ceased to exist, although I continued to observe this overhead location for another 30 minutes and could still (but barely) make out a faint amorphous form in its place. At this point, and all throughout the observing period, there were still no clouds in the sky, and we heard no sounds from the object. There were occasional commercial aircraft traversing the sky at various altitudes, but none had any interaction or effect on this object, which was at an unknown but seemingly high altitude. I did not see any reports in this morning&#39;s (Wednesday) local daily newspaper.

At first I thought it was a portion of the moon with the rest being onscured by clouds. At second look, I realized that it was a clear night and there were no clouds. I realized that it was some type of object that was moving slowly across the sky from southeast to northwest. I watched it for about 5 minutes before calling my 14 year old son outside to look at it. We watched it for another five minutes. The object was lit by a clear light that was constant. No blinking or other lights. It moved horizontally across the sky at a very slow speed. Towards the end, the light seemed to slowly diminish and it just faded away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We wonder whether the witness might have observed a contrail behind a high-altitude aircraft.

At apx. 9m we took a break and all 6 of us went out onto the back deck.  I noticed a strange site in the sky.  It looked like two very large stars shaped like rectangles and lightly covered by a cloud.  It was a completely clear night with no other clouds at all.  The &#34;stars&#34; seemed to be pulsing slightly and the &#34;nebula&#34; surrounding them began to grow larger and disperse over the next 15 minutes.  We observed the &#34;nebula&#34; cloud consistently moved north east.   And then interestingly enough, we observed at least 3 &#34;shooting stars&#34; within the same 15 min. span.  We saw at least 5 other small aircraft flying in the same vicinity.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first, we discussed whether it could be the moon in cloud cover but the sky was clear and the moon was to east.  Then we discussed how it appeared to be an explosion in the higher atmosphere (50,000 to 60,000 feet).  One member of Zen (the band) is an experienced pilot and flight instructor and it was through his experience that we arrived at these estimates of distance.  His comment was, &#34;in all my years of flying, I&#39;ve never seen anything like this.&#34;  We wondered if it could possibly be a large passenger airplane enroute from Washington, DC that had exploded at that altitude (maybe a terrorist event).<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Result of earlier missile launch.

Then I saw that it was elongated horizontally with dimmer blurs of light above and below the central bar of light, which through 7x binoculars showed as a two part bar. It was about 1/3 the size of the moon. The end of the bar to my left (SE) was more pointed and there was an occasional pinpoint flash of light just to the left of the point. The object rose slowly and when about 45 degrees up it seemed a bit over 1/2 the size of the moon and had more structure. It was like diffuse almost back to back curved parentheses crossed by the two part bar. It was travelling in a direction perpendicular to the bar. by the time it reached the zenith it was dimmer and to the naked eye was just a blur, though structure was still visible through binoculars.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It moved slower than any satellite I have seen. It made no sound. the sky was very clear and full of stars, with just a few left-over cumulus clouds.

We were coming out of the plant Conservatory shortly before 9pm EST when two Security Guards approached us asking if we had any idea what &#34;that&#34; was. He pointed above the trees, about 45 degrees up to a fuzzy but distinct patch of light approximately a degree in diameter. As an experienced amature astronomer my first impression was that it was the moon heavily obscured by clouds. I dismissed that idea since the moon would have been just rising in the east and this object was only a few degrees SW of corona borealis. Plus the sky was completely cloud free. I said to the guards that I was baffled and had never seen anything like it before. It resembled a comet but without a tail.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first it appeared stationary. The water display began, but I was more interested in this object and kept checking it out throughout the display. It passed through corona borealis slowly in a straight line. I would guess it moved about a degree a minute. As it moved it changed shape from what appeared to be elongated to more or less spherical. It also gradually and steadily diminished in brightness. I continued to track it until about 9:25 PM EST by which time I could no longer detect it. By that time it was entering the constellation Cygnus which was high overhead. The object never changed speed or course. It was probably visible well before it was pointed out to me. Other people in the crowd were looking up occasionally but as the water display continued they seemed to have lost interest in it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Missile launch.  PD))<n>

As we watched others (3) also observed it. The more we watched it we noticed that it was moving very slowly North. I went inside my business and got binoculars. Through the binoculars the object looked almost like a Nebula that had exploded. It was all whaite lighted and I noticed a white light on the rear of it that blinked in no particular rhythm. Again it was moving verys slowly and by watching the stars in relation to the object close up I could tell it wasn&#39;t following the planets rotation it was definately headed North.

She told us that she saw a UFO in the sky.  I was very skeptical when approaching.  I really did not expect to see anything.  However, there was clearly something to see in the sky to the West of our location.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Our Daughter went in the house to find the binoculars and I went in to find the telescope and camera.  My Wife watched it while our Daughter and I went into the house.  When we came out, it was still there and was visible with the naked eye and very distinct when viewed through the binoculars.  I could not focus on it through the telescope nor could I find it in the viewfinder of my camera.  There did not seem to be enough light from the object to get it on the camera.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The night sky was dark, but very clear.  The moon had not risen yet.  And there were no visible clouds in the sky.  Two airplanes were visible in the sky, but appeared to be flying lower than the object in the sky and the size of this object was much larger than the airplanes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The shape of the object, when viewed through the binoculars was like a cigar shape in the middle and 4 jetting protrusions curving away from the cigar like center.  Also, when looking through binoculars (7x50 power), the overall object looked to be gaseous in form.  However, it never lost its shape (I watched it for about 30 minutes).  The color was a gray to white, but of course this was about 8:45 pm and dark outside. The only other way I can describe the color was that it looked similar to viewing a comet, but of course the shape was not typical of a comet.  The tip of the object, on the cigar like center, had an intermittent flash that would occur about every 30 seconds.  This flash was not visible with the naked eye, only through binoculars.  The flash was like that of a dimly lit star, but as the object moved slowly across the sky (toward the East), the flash stayed at the point on the cigar portion of the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When the object was almost directly overhead, it appeared to move further away (higher in the sky).  It became fainter and harder to see.  Even looking through the binoculars, it held its shape but became smaller and dimmer.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At this point I went in the house.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Result of earlier missile launch.

EST August 31, 2004-resembled airplane explosion in atmosphere to unaided, naked eye<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had been talking to my sister on my cell phone outside around 8:30 P.M. Tuesday, August 31, 2004. I was the first person in my family to see the shape in the sky around 8:35 P.M. EST. I watched the shape for several minutes, which upon first glance resembled an exploded airplane to the naked eye. It never once seemed to be a comet or round object, but I could tell it was very high in the atmosphere. There was a distinct long, white, horizontal bar in the center of what looked like &#34;debris&#34;, or &#34;white light&#34; radiating from the bar. Watching it five minutes later with binoculars, the shape had moved north and the &#34;debris&#34;, or &#34;white light&#34; had dissipated enough so that the white bar had disappeared, and the &#34;debris field&#34;, or &#34;white light&#34; had separated into two very distinct halves. I had spoken to an older sister around 9:15 P.M. EST who lives in Florida, and she did not see it. The shape had continued to dissipate and move north toward Canada, then due east toward Pennsylvania until it had disappeared altogether around 9:30 P.M. EST. Please remember that much of my own account was seen by the naked eye. The moon had not yet risen, so it was fairly dark outside. My parents had used a telescope and binoculars through most of the observation whereas I had not.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Result of earlier missile launch.

I then acquired it with my binoculars and could plainly see a strobe on the very point of the object, flashing white in about a .5 second cycle. As the anomoly moved eastward slowly, it began looking more like a cloud, which was formed to this apparent shape(see attached) but being extremely dense , especially nearest the strobe.The shape was perfectly symmetrical and well defined.  The light stopped flashing after a minute or so and was no longer visible. As the anomoly moved east over about another 10 minutes  into the darkness it seemed to disappate, just as an ordinary cloud would do, but it moved into the darkness and I may simply have not been able to see the unlit anomoly in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We express our gratitude to Mr. Kim Shaffer, State Director for MUFON/Eastern Tennessee, for sharing this report with NUFORC.

I and my wife saw the lights and I believe that they were three distinctly seperate objects.  After being alerted to the lights by a family member in Oak Forest we looked up from the area of 179th street and 67th Avenue.  In the Eastern sky we saw the three lights in what appeared to be an almost straight line from top to bottom with the bottom light a little further to the right (South) of the others.  As we watched the middle light moved to the right (South) of both of the others forming a triangle of sorts.  A couple of minutes later the bottom light moved up into the place that second light (the one that had moved out when the triangle was formed) was and a semi-straight line was again formed before the lights disappeared.  This movement is why I believe that these three lights were completely autonomous and seperate.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Said to wife that a childs balloon got away, but it held my attention and I didn&#39;t know why at first.  It was rising beneath a mammatus cloud formation and the wind was blowing 20 to 30 mph.  At first it looked like a solid white balloon that had been released from a nearby shopping center seconds earlier; like an 18&#34; balloon that was maybe 150 feet up.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I and my wife watched we both said that it was no balloon of any kind because it was rising straight up with no sideways movement at all.  Second, it was moving way too fast to be a helium balloon.  It was at this point that I had the impression that the object wasn&#39;t as close to me as I first thought.  It continued to rise in a non-swirling uninterrupted manner until it was about 80 to 85 degrees over head from horizontal.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had been viewing this through an open window of a car to this point.  I looked down to open the door and get out to continue viewing.  When I looked back up I no longer saw it beneath the dark clouds where I expected to find it once more.

The object was not shiny and had texture to it; it was not completely flat; and was a sort of gunmetal color, maybe bordering closer to gold than silver.  There was no sound and there were no lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My sister said immediately, &#34;that was the classic cigar shape&#34;.  She was right.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This object was flying well within the no-fly zone and away from the traditional flight paths that we observe from here which are well to the north.  The object was flying at an altitude common for helicopters.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I got my camera immediately afterward and got a photograph of the two clouds, the one from which it first appeared and the one into which it disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On May 21 of this year, my sister and I saw balls of light moving furiously in a counter clockwise circle from windows about 10 feet from the balcony where we were today.  Though those balls were much lower in the sky, the location of that incident and this one are almost identical.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Witness Two: It was flying at about the speed I would expect of a commercial aircraft, although it was far, far off the usual commercial flight path.  The thought that kept going through my mind was &#34;that&#39;s not a plane, it&#39;s not a jet&#34;.  It was a classic cigar shape, no wings or markings  other than what appeared to be a dark band about one third of the length from the back end. It&#39;s difficult to judge size based on distance, but my impression is that it was extremely large, that it was double or more the size of a commercial airliner.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It moved very smoothly and silently.  Color was a dull metallic gunmetal and there were no visible lights on the craft.   I agree with everything in my sister&#39;s report.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  This appears to us to be a high-quality report, and it is submitted by a witness who has submitted another credible report, in the past.  Based on her description, we do not see how the object could have been any type of conventional aircraft.  We would welcome reports from any other witnesses, who may have witnessed the same event.

The 4 objects moved left and right amongst them although they stayed together in a group of 4 close together as they travelled.  They were not moving like a formation of 4 planes.  Also a jet liner travelled across the view, West to East,between me and the 4 objects, so I had a comparative object for size.  The 4 objects continued their accent and were soon out of my line of sight. The weather was perfectly clear day with bright sunshine.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Instinctively we thought it was a plane but it did not make ANY noise.None at all. It was going a steady speed over the house,sort of fast. It was very strange because usually blimps are much larger and planes make alot of noise so it could not have been either.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous.

As I was walking down this darkened street, I saw the odd shaped ship I&#39;ll enclose a drawing of.  I recall being very calm about it and thinking to myself, &#34;Well, THAT&#39;S not what I thought a UFO is supposed to look like.&#34;  I clearly went there to meet it.  I have a history of weird things happening in my life anyway, so this isn&#39;t all that unexpected I guess.  I drew what I could remember, though it was foggy...so may not be perfect.  The general shape is pretty good though.  Where I might be off is where the portholes/lights were.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I walked outside to smoke a cig and as I turned my head towards the neighbors yard a small circle of light appeared, traveled for approx 2 seconds downward at a steep angle, then disappeared. I thought it might&#39;ve been a comet at first (before it vanished), then maybe a spark from a fireworks display, but there were no fireworks around. I looked all around my house, asked my friends if they had lit anything, etc. It seemed pretty small, but it could&#39;ve been in the way distance. It disappeared before it hit the tree line so I had no indication. It seemed perfectly white (but not really glowing, didn&#39;t notice a halo around it) and also perfectly round. Startled the hell out of me, that&#39;s for sure. No sound at all. It was west of my house, which is about half a mile away from the Atlantic Ocean, central NJ.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

He began pulling on his leash trying to go back inside before he had done his business.  I then looked up and saw three very bright lights that were moving somewhat erratically, but always in a coordinated way.  I watched them for a minute or so until they suddenly shot off to the north at an unbelievable speed.  Then while I was watching to see if they would return I became aware of a very low frequency hum or perhaps it was more like an electrical hum  and I actually felt it more than I heard it.  I looked around but at first did not see anything.  Then I noticed a huge spot in the sky that appeared to be darker than the rest of the night time sky.  This black oval shaped spot moved very slowly across the sky directly above me moving from south to north.  There were no lights and other than the initial low frequency sound I heard it was completely silent.  This object was enormous and when it was directly above me blocked out about half of the visible night time sky.  I could not tell how far away it was but I got the impression that it was relatively close (perhaps several miles high).  I watched the thing until it was nearly out of sight before I remembered that I needed another witness.  I ran into the house and called for my wife to come outside.  But by the time she got to the yard it was so far away it was difficult to see.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I called the local radio and TV station to see if anyone else had reported anything and they were unaware of any reports.

I was looking North out my bedroom window and saw an unusual light heading toward our ranch house.  I retrieved my field glasses and observed a set of red, white, and blue blinking lights. The aircraft was traveling slowly from north to south and was at a 30 degree angle from where I was standing. I went outside with the field glasses and focused on the object.  The aircraft was closer now, but I could only see the lights, not the aircraft.  The lights began to blink and blink twice the rate of aircraft strobe lights.  I lowered the binoculars and watched the aircraft begin to dart about much the way a hummingbird would. This activity went on for several minutes.  The shape of the craft was not distinguishable.  The rapid gyrations were covering about 10 degrees of sweep right to left, left to right and up and down.  I hurried into the house and asked my wife to check out this object in the sky.  When we went outside the object was gone.  There were thin clouds near where I last saw the object.  The total time of observation was approx. 3 minutes. The moon was nearly full and very bright.

Of the remaining 4 stars, the 2nd star moved towards the adjacent star. After some time, of the 3 remaining stars 2 disappeared. Lastly, the 2 that got together faded away. From the time they were observed first, the whole episode took about 15-20 mts. Except for the second star that moved towards the first, all the others were stationary. It was a clody day, no other stars could be seen, the moon (believe day after full moon) shone through the clouds at times.  What was unusual was the stars were aligned in a straight line, one star moving towards the other and pronounced blinking. Also, they were stationery, except the 2nd star.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Background of the observers: Phd in Economics, 3 children going to school(ages 6 to 12), 2 medical doctors, housewife, pool attendents 2, helper<n>

We first noticed the first one on the 30th of Aug. as a cloud bank was building in the west, we watched this for about 15 minutes until it was obscured by the cloud bank. The next day of the 31st. one object appeared in the west and as we were watching this another appeared in the northern sky. As we were looking at the one in the west it blinked out then reappeared to the right of it&#39;s origional position. Then to the lower left of this object another object blinked on then off very quickley. I viewed both remaining objects through a pair of binoculars and both were seen as objects that were reflecting light off the right side with a dark outline to the opposite side. It looked like they were reflecting the light and not emitting it as a source. These objects remained in the daylight sky for aprox. 2hrs. time. As we were watching the object in the north began drifting to the west towards the object in the west at a slow pace. As it was nearly to the half way point between it&#39;s origional position and the object in the west the object in the west blinked out. This object came to a position that put in in almost the same place as the first object in the western sky. It remained in this position until almost sunset then began moving to the north west and eventualy turned red and then blinked out. My two friends and other people that were walking back from the beach after the launch were witness to the lights as we pointed them out to them. All of the ones coming fron the beach were talking about the strange show in the sky, but I did not see this because I was involved with the lights. My daughter told me at the time of the launch she was watching a grey cylinder in the sky to the south of the launch.which caught her and her friends attention and also all the other things that others saw with launch. We took some digital film of the object in the western sky but all we could see was mostly a round object at best, but we have this footage. But when viewed throgh the camera the objects were definitly stationary reflective objects. As an explanation these could also have possibly been government satilites for observing the launch, but I would not know why so many and how they would blink out and reappear in another location so quickly.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I have reported this type of event several times over the past month.  Once again, I was looking east from my back patio.  The sky was mostly blue with a few patchy areas of high clouds.  I see the starlike object again, like a small point of light; through binoculars it looks like a whitish sphere.  I am an avid skywatcher and am very adept at spotting tiny objects in the sky; no one else would have likely seen this unless they&#39;d been deliberately looking closely.  In fact between trying to find it in the binocs (my arms get tired holding the binocs up) and looking with naked eye, it was not easy to keep track of; yet it remained very nearly stationary for about 2 minutes.  As I was looking at it through binoculars, it very quickly took off moving to the south/southeast.  I did not take my eyes off it until it went past the line of my roof, which took roughly 15 to 20 seconds.  So from stationary to very rapidly moving, yet again -- as reported earlier in the month.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was not going to report the following but since I&#39;m submitting something, about a half-hour prior to the white sphere sighting of today, I also saw a metallic red sphere, also seemingly motionless and very high in the sky (hard to notice).  Could not tell through binocs whether it was a red mylar balloon or what; but I lost sight of it and couldn&#39;t find it again after just a minute or two.  Four minutes later, at 1.32 PM, I saw an aircraft fly overhead and over the area of the sky in which I&#39;d seen the red sphere: in the direction of DIA (to the northeast).  Some aircraft today have been leaving short contrails, others have not. This was leaving a contrail, two streams rather farther apart than a normal aircraft; I looked through binoculars and what I saw took me by surprise.  This was some sort of military craft I&#39;m sure; a dull gray, flattened triangle.  There was no fuselage; it was just a large gray wing, much wider than long, with the shorter point of the triangle in the direction of flight.  The sound was similar to a regular jet, although it did seem to rumble a bit longer than I would have expected as it disappeared in the distance.  I got a good look at it; it was definitely no ordinary airplane or jet.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

8/30/04 05:00|Sedona|AZ|Light|2-3 minutes|Shortly before 5 a.m., I awoke to the sound of one of my cats making noise upstairs.   ((NUFORC Note:  We suspect Venus??))|9/1/04|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/038/S38967.html|70|ndxe200408| Shortly before 5 a.m., I awoke to the sound of one of my cats making noise upstairs.  I got out of bed to go to the bathroom, and when I went back to bed, my gaze shifted to the view outside my patio doors.  In the sky, slightly above Wilson Mountain, I observed an extremely bright white light, which appeared to be stationary.  The luminosity of this light was exceptional, and looked exactly like the white sparklers kids use on the 4th of July.  The light was radiating out from a central point, in brilliant sparkling rays, just like a sparkler.  The light also seemed to pulse a bit, getting bigger and brighter, and then dimmer and smaller.  I was almost transfixed by it, it was so  extraordinarily beautiful, and I did not want to leave my observation of it, but I did want a photograph, and so I went upstairs to get my camera and shoot from the outside balcony there.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I got upstairs the light was still there, but lower on the horizon, and closer to the top of the mountain.  My sense of it was that it would soon be gone, and I hurriedly grabbed my digital camera, went outside and observed it very close to the top of the mountain, and getting lower.  I took one shot, lowered my camera, and it was gone, so I do not know if I pressed the shutter in time, but my image is completely black, except for the wall of the balcony, which shows clearly.  This is unusual, because there was enough light in the sky so that the mountains should have been visible in the photo against the dawn sky,  but that area is completely black.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Something else unusual is that I do take very many paranormal photographs in which I do not see the lights and shapes that appear in my photographs, but this time, I saw a mysterious light, and the landscape in the image is completely black.  There was no noise from the light.  I looked at the clock on my kitchen oven, and the time was exactly 5:00 a.m.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This light was like nothing I have ever seen.

It appeared round and stuck out like a sore thumb as it was completely dark and the sky was very clear without any trace of clouds. The object stuck out because it was the brightest object in the sky, it glowed intensly white and then stayed like that for a good 15 seconds before fading out and dissapearing from view.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I soon realized its altitude was much higher and was moving eastward. This object was at the same altitude as the air-traffic from San Jose Int&#39;l Airport. This object was large and was the approx. size of a passenger Jet. From my position the object was the size of a jelly-bean. It was dark in color and the shape was somewhere between oval and rectangle. This object had no wings, propellers or any other aero-dynamic features. HAS ANY ONE ELSE NOTICED THIS BESIDES ME!? (I did not see an obvious reaction from traffic; and have heard no news reports.)<n>

My dock faces almost straight north and our property is at the south end of Pigeon Lake looking down the lake, not accross it. The sky to the north was fairly cloud covered and to the north east it looked as though a thunder storm was brewing. As I looked north towards a couple of boats fishing about 200 meters from our shore I spotted what looked like a dark cloud very low in the sky moving quickly from west to east in the distance behind the boats. As I was just about to point it out to my wife, it suddenly stopped and changed direction and began moving east to west, after a short distance it changed direction again to travel west to east. At this time my wife saw it to and we watched it continue east and out of sight. I ran to the house and got my digital camera but after an half an hour or so of waiting and watching nothing appeared. My wife and both agree we have never seen anything like this before and are at a loss to explain it. I am useally a logical person and believe that all things can be explained but I&#39;m stomped. I would glady take a lie detector test to recount what I saw. An explaination would greatly be appriciated. Thanks.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I tilted my head back to relax on my lawn chair and notice a bright object in the sky.  It was much to early for a star to be out and no it was not a satellite.  Satellites that I&#39;ve seen don&#39;t stay in one place they move consistently across the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My first thought was it was a balloon, being that there a skyway over my house, a passenger jet flew over.  The object was appeared to be 1000s of feet above the skyway.  Just eyeballing the comparison, it was way to big to be a balloon.  Then I thought a helicopter? Some romantic person enjoying the sunset? Nah, helicopters don&#39;t fly that high.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I took out my only camera which had black and white film, took of the auto focus and aimed in the direction of the object.   It was difficult to see through the lens, however very easy to spot with the naked eye.   I used the branches above me to get a bearing where the object might be, as now it was slowly moving and stopping across the sky.  From a SouthWest to a North Direction over Santa Monica.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I didn&#39;t know what to do or who to call, strangely I sat back and let the object move out of sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I got the pictures developed, they appeared blank!  I could not believe it!  However when my friend scanned them in through photoshop he adjusted the contrast so it was only black and white.  Suddenly right were I remember taking the picture the object appeared!  We zoomed in and noticed it appeared the have a triangular light side, the dark side however we can&#39;t see.  Perhaps there&#39;s a process that can be done with the negatives?  When I was younger a couple of buddies and I entered an X-Files competition and we faked a couple of saucer shots using fishing wire, the good side to that is I can spot a fake UFO shot almost instantly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I don&#39;t know what&#39;s in the picture, they are not the most glamorous set of U.F.O. pictures ever seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((initials deleted))<n>

I noticed there was not a cloud in the sky and said to my daughter &#34;did you notice the sky&#34;. When she and I looked up we saw what appeared to be stars. We counted a total of 11 objects. One of them was oval shaped and larger than the other ten circular objects. The larger object was light yellow in color as compared to the other 10 which were white like {night stars}. All 11 objects appeared to be hovering very slightly. We both were able to count them at least 3 times. There was also a plane traveling due south while the objects were still in the sky, the objects appeared to be much higher then the plane. We turned away for about a second or two and when we looked up again all 11 objects were gone. We have never seen anything like this nor have we ever had any interest in UFO&#39;S.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous.  PD))<n>

We were riding adjacent to the husdon river and had a perfect view of the New York City Sky line.  I looked out my window and could see this triangle shaped object hovering directly above the Empire State Building.  What caught my attention was that it hovered under a blimp for a moment, stopped and moved from east to west and back again, like a pendulum. How does a Helicoper hover under a blimp?  It also hovered down as if trying to touch the tip of the Empire State Building and then back up again. We observed the object until our view was obstructed as the bus approached the tunnel.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There is something else I could not explain.  It would suddenly flash, as if the sun would casue it to glare but very suddenly and briefly, a metallic color.  FLASH.  It did this 3 times as if it were spinning and the shiny part would hit the sun.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I tried to believe it was a helicopter but their was a helicopter flying over the hudson river to the right of the object, (The Blimp was to the left) and I could clearly see all three objects in a clear cloudless sky.  I cannot verify that this was not a helicopter becasue of depth perception but my girlfriend agreed on the shape and odd flash.<n> <n><n> <n><n> With all the security, tight US Airspace and in the midst of one of the biggest protests in history in the middle of the Republican Convention I cannot be sure how such an object flying so low was not noticed.

The object went West across the horizonin in about 10 seconds and then stopped. After stopping, it then dropped out a dark bundle like object. Soon after that,it then turned and came towards us(South)rather quickly.  THere was no sound at all.  Then after only going about 1 mile down the road, the object it seemed was almost instantly in right front of us. The object then began to hover slowly overtop of us. WE were still driving down the road so we ended up going right under it.  THe object was triangular with one light on each point of the triangle.  There was also a red light located next to one of the lights. After the object went over top of us, I looked out of my sunroof behind me and the lights began to change into different patterns.  They began flashing and doing different shapes using red, blue, and yellowish lights.  Because we were traveling on an interstate, it was impossible for us to stop or turn around because of a median.  But as we continued driving, I wathced out of the sunroof of my Ford Explorer and noticed that it was still moving slowly over top the interstate and then up a little.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Everyone started pointing at something in the sky.  Way above us, very dim, I spotted something that looked like a star--very dim.  There were three or four star-like objects.  At first, I thought it might be a shooting star, but they started moving in multiple directions, rapidly accelerating and changing direction with no discernable purpose.  I looked away to watch a band play at the park, and when I looked again, they were gone.  The other twenty or so people who looked up and could spot them were amazed.  It really freaked a few people out.  I had nothing to drink and no other mind-altering substances. I&#39;m sure several of the other witnesses had, however.  Still, I just wanted to tell someone.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

As I was looking toward the west, a silver ball of light caught my eye.  This light moved from south to north with no noise and no flashing lights (we live near McChord AFB and SeaTac flight paths and frequently see planes in the distance).  My second thought was a bird, but the light moved very smoothly, with none of the obvious &#34;Bobbing&#34; of a bird, plus it was illuminated from the east side, not the west where the sun was setting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I got to my front yard I could no longer see the silver light, however as I looked into the west I saw an orange colored cloud (from the sunset) off to the west.  As I looked at this cloud, I saw a gold colored ball appear.  It appeared to drop from the cloud (the best way I can describe it is like when a plane, coming out of a cloud, kind of fades into view)then travel in a northerly direction and then just flash out as if someone had turned off the switch (it could have re-entered the cloud cover, but I&#39;m not sure of this).  At first I thought someone was burning and I was seeing embers flying through the sky except that you could clearly see them come out of the cloud and move toward the north.  About the third one I saw looked like it was moving toward the ground, then went back up and continued its flight to the north.  In all I watched about 10 of these gold balls of light.  At one point there were three in the sky at the same time each appearing to come out of the cloud and then moving to the north and disappearing.  Again, there was no noise, no flashing lights, just these gold balls appearing to drop from the cloud. The entire thing lasted 5 to 10 minutes maximum.  I have been an amature astronomer all my life and I have never seen anything like this.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

(This would be an South-North/NorthEast movement for me. There is a house across the street and a treeline. There are some power lines but I would say from my second floor window, it looked to be about 50-75 feet higher than the treeline. I have heard of some reports in the area of lights or mysterious obkects in the sky. I would say that it was a very bright silver metallic color and moved about 50 mph to me.

I was sitting out on my back patio at around 10:30pm and just looking up in the sky as I normally do at night, to check out the stars. I noticed a light in the North sky about halfway from the ground to zenith. I first saw it out of the corner of my eye and thought it was just a plane. When I turned to look at it I noticed it was not a plane at all. It was about the color and intensity of Mars was last year at its peak. It got brighter and brighter untill it was about the size of a small pea, stayed in one spot for 2 seconds, then it moved down the sky at about a 45 degree angle. It only moved about a foot in the sky and then disappeared without fading. It is totally clear here tonight. I said to myself what the hell was that? I don&#39;t think it was a meteor because it moved too slowly and I have seen some pretty good meteors in the past. Also I don’t think it was a satellite. I am pretty good about pointing out satellites to my wife and daughter, and this was not like them. It definitely was pretty high up and I did not hear anything. I have noticed weird things in the sky before but this is the first time here in Virginia. I reported sightings on this sight in the past (Coverse, TX 9/10/03 and Randolph AFB 7/5/03) I have also seen some weird stuff when I used to live back home in Rochester, NY when I was in high school about 12 years ago.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  One of several seemingly credible reports from the same individual, who describes himself as being a member of the U.

We were driving on the interstate a bit after the sun had already set, and I was leaning my head on the backseat passenger window just gazing out into the sky. My father was driving, and my mother was in the front passenger seat. I soon noticed a tiny white light traveling in a sparatically upward pattern. I dismissed it as a plane, but soon realized that the craft was changing direction far too much to be any kind of passenger jet. I followed it silently as it changed direction instantly several times, trying to keep focused on it. I soon told my mother, and she noticed the craft too. We were both astonished by its irregular motion, and it soon dissapeared into the distance, as if it had suddenly shot away from us, instantaneously. But, seconds later, it re-appeared, the light was still at the same opacity, but it had re-appeared in a location far from where it had disappeared. We were both a little frightened by the reality of the situation, but it didn&#39;t cause us to jump to conclusions or anything else of that sort. We were still on the interstate, and we had told my father of the craft, but he was busy driving and was not able to get a look. My mother and I followed the craft as it seemed to stop dead in the sky. No longer than it had been motionless, it began to give off what seemed tiny little explosions. It looked like the craft was kind of popping bright shimmering fireworks. It looked much like very dim artillery shell-style fireworks blowing up right off of the craft itself. We watched this happen several times, 8-10 times. We could even see would seemed like the little embers from these explosions floating downward toward the ground. The craft continued to kind of spontaneously combust, and eventually began moving once again in its sparatic movement. We watched it move across the sky and eventually dissapear once again, all the while it was still exploding like a faint artillery shell. It eventually left our sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

So what ever It was it seemed to be moving to reposition itself to be camouflaged against the sky...But unlike others which I have noticed over airports at times this object was in the same area moving again to &#34;reposition&#34; itself with a flash or glint of sun reflecting off a silver metal disc before totally disappearing. I slow down and check to hear engines or see if it is a small plane.  There was no noise from engines etc...<n> <n><n> <n><n> The second time I saw it over a powerline grid and the ranch house off the interstate and it was hard to determine how high it was but I suspect 500-100ft up...<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Later when it was dark u could see some helicoppers flying around the area, then for a while we pratices it for 2 hours later of the arts. So I was tirer and went for a drink and notices there were 4 bright yellow and orange objects in the sky as a paturen like a line in the sky so first I thought it was air planes or something so I didnt care much about it so i went back to what i was doing so then about 1 whole hour later those object where still there so i went out side of the building and stare at it so my teachers ask me what i was doing so i told them to come here to look at this so they did.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I told the them the these object has not move for an hour they told me that it an air plane i said no it not a air plane and out of no where 1 of the object disapear to nothing my friends said that an air plane i said if that an air plane why is it not flashing and they said they dont know so the object of 3 were left the move into a formation like a triangle 1 on top and 2 on the bottom that was weird and then i saw the object move away in a high rate of speed faster then a jet fighter maybe 400 to 500 miles per hour very very weird we all said to are self oh my god, what the hell, holly shit we could not under stand that what we saw because it was still and move slowly at first then stop for a while and then move so fast a disapear to nothing threw my year of working with air crafts a the airport and this is not something of ares i dont know where it came from or what it is i know that was not ares we dont have that type of technology to do that. they seem to be over the military base in san diego.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I knelt down in front of the window and looked up as an army type chopper was indeed in veiw,    I watched for only a few second before a second object passed (east) above the helicopter.  It inter my sight from a direction over my house and as crossed the path of the helicopter it switched direction (to north) and was lost behind a grouping of trees.  The object as I was looking up and at an angle was an unmistakable triangle.  It appeared black in color with a flashing light at the point facing the rear.  It had other lights along the bottom and sides but they were not as bright.  There was no sound apart from the noise of the chopper that I could detect.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I was talking to my 6 year old son about the craters on the moon and what caused them.  As I began to move away from the eye piece, so he could have another look, I saw 3 triangular objects move directly through the middle of my field of view toward the west.  With this telescope the moon almost fills the field of view.  With a bright and almost full moon as a background the objects appeared to be black.  They passed by the moon in about one second.  Right through the middle of the moon.  They seemed to be very far away from us.  But I can&#39;t be sure of that.  I immediately looked up with my naked eye but couldn&#39;t see anything.  No lights, nothing.  They seemed to be exactly the same distance from each other.  Similar to the way figher jets fly in formation.  I&#39;ll try to give an example of their size.  If you have a grapefruit, then take 3 peas (pretend they are triangular shaped peas) and make a triangle with them in the middle of the grapfruit and separate them by about 1/4 inch then you would understand the size and the relationship between the 3 objects that I saw through the telescope.  I didn&#39;t notice any vapor trails, no distortion of the atmosphere from the heat of an exhaust or anything like that. I don&#39;t know what I heck I saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I could only see flashes of the lightning from my rear view mirror. Above me was a dark sky with some stars visable. I was glancing up at the sky while also driving when a light appeared out of the dark sky like someone turned on a switch. I did not think much of it at first believing it was just a plane at first, but and light was stationary. So my next thought was it was a helicopter, but, the light turned from white to orange. It looked like the end of a cigarette when someone inhales off it. It had a bright glow and slowly dimmed to nothing.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Watching, a triangle shape of stars was moving with the light moving s.e..  It was apparent that it was a craft of some type hovering closer to earth than the other jets in the sky.  You could have placed 20 other jets inside the area, judging from the size of the other planes in the sky. It moved slowly out of sight, so slow i used limbs in trees to mark its progress, after about 15 minutes it was out of sight. This is the 3 or 4 time i&#39;ve seen unexplainable objects in our region in the last several years, from lasting just seconds to several hours.

My 14-yr-old nephew and my 18 yr-old babysitter saw UFOs first. I arrived home with my 22 yr-old niece at about 10:30 pm on 8/25 and they were excited, having seen about 10 &#34;sparkling&#34; objects flying in the sky above Long Island Sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I spoke with them about it, several more appeared in the sky, and by midnight we had seen approximately 40 of them. They would fly from over the ocean to inland, all in the same direction, approx. SE to NE. Several of these objects would fly in triangle or trapazoid patterns and looked to deliberately fly close and then closely cross each other&#39;s flight paths. At times, they looked like they might crash. Two flew very low over our heads and we could see the bottom of one. It looked like a triangle with a light at each point. When the objects flew over, a low flying helicopter appeared and at first appeared to follow one of the objects, but then contiuned straight on its path, away from the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> During this 2 hour period, there was a very low &#34;planet&#34; sitting over the water. It was motionless, large, shiny and sparkled red, blue, green and white. At 11:50, it stopped sparkling, dimmed and flew off in the direction of the other objects. None of these objects made any noise - all were completely silent.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The next night we sat out at 10:15 pm to see if we&#39;d see them again and did. We saw approximately 30 &#34;sparklers&#34; flying in the same direction as the previous night and behaving the same way as had the others.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We also sat out last night and saw approximately 10 &#34;sparklers&#34; - same MO.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I contacted an Air Force office in New Haven (a number I received from 411) and they said there were no bases in CT, Montauk was not being used (closest military base to us, although it was closed decades ago), they were not flying over Madison, Ct and the objects &#34;were not ours.&#34;  We will sit out tonight to see if any more of these strange objects appear.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Post Script: Also: On the second night, a large bright white object appeared low in the sky over the water, arced directly down towards the water and disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We have spoken with this witness on several occasions, and she sounds sincere and credible to us.

It appears to flash red, blue and white and for a long time I thought this was due to atmospheric interference or that perhaps it was Sirius or another star commonly mistaken for a UFO.  In any case, I purchased a pair of binoculars with a magnification of 16x and got a better view of this object.  The red and blue flashes are not due to atmospheric interference but actually emanate from the perimiter of the object, the center of which appears to be bright white.  Also, I had to focus the binoculars to less than infinity in order to see the object most clearly, suggesting that the object is not a star although it certainly appears to be one each night.  I suppose it must be a satellite, but wow, are all these new satellites going to have such distracting flashing lights?<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Star, probably Sirius.  PD))<n>

I was amazed at this changing of the craft and it reminded me of the old buck rogers serials of the 1930&#39;s and was very beautiful to see.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About a year and a half ago I reported seeing a similar craft on Palomar Airport Road in Carlsbad about three miles from this location.  This craft was identical but I saw it from a different angle and no lights were visible.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The lights included three in one group and three in another, these lights all stayed within each others boundrys. Then out of nowhere, one of the lights just seemed to fly off...the rest just disapeared. After sometime of looking for the same objects in that area, we came across another light.. now this light lit up and would seem to fade out... now you can understand that i find this a bit odd...i mean, you never even see stuff like this in canyon..<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous.

In the center of the craft was a glowing white sphere. It acted like a giant flash on a camera. The sky lit up multiple time. I al so saw two more hovering over a cornfield in front of my develolpment. When i ran to get my camera they had dissapeared. I could do a drawing of the object if needed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We assume the witness implies an evening sighting.  We have amended the time above accordingly.  PD))<n>

They change colors (red, green, blue,)and when we observe them through the binoculars we notice they change from saucer to oval shaped. We can see like portals on the top outside of the craft through the binoculars. With the naked eye they sway from side to side. A green light or red light blinking it changes. Just a few nights ago my wife and I were in Skyline park in the desert in Susanville and we were observing them. A police car pulled up and the officer walked up to us. She asked us what we were doing and we told her and pointed out a ufo. We handed her the binoculars and she looked at it. She looks back at us with a stunned look on her face and then pulled her maglite and flashed the craft. The craft flashed back at us and it moved, the officer then looked at us and said: &#34;Did you guys see that it moved&#34;! and then said again to us: &#34;You guys are freaking me out&#34;! and she took off! We noticed that there will be two of these objects by the moon and the rest in a circular position in the night sky around the Susanville area. Another thing I would like to add is that the objects will black out when we try to see them in our telescope, when we look away they turn their lights back on. They dont seem to mind us looking at them through the binoculars. Yesterday my wife and I flashed one of the closest ones with a spotlight and it moved its way toward us, so my wife runs in the house to avoid it.We have currently had a small storm and that night with the police officer there was a storm in the distance about a mile , it seemed like they were observing the storm.These ufos are still out here right now.

I&#39;m an aviation enthusiast and i  know an aircraft if i see one whether close or far, let me tell you these where NO aircraft they formed two patterns of a triangular shape, they were grouped in threes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The light emmited was orange and seemed stationary for a short while then they started to move ever so slowly to the south. we could not make out the shape of the objects due to the intensity of the lights. Iknow that the object hat to have been lower than 3000 ft. because there was a cloud cover at aprox 3000 ft.this information was provided to me by the B.O.M.on the net.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The objects vanished as if some one was dimming the lights, no doubt they were moving away because the lights were seen entering the clouds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The exact location of thsighting is: S 35deg 16min 20.5 sec    E 149deg 07min 51.6sec<n>

Ususall when they reappear they are some distance from the first place, usually in a horizonal line but much to far for a plane or &#39;copter to be able to move that quickly. The lights are not seen constantly but come and go. Last night it was over a 20-30 minute period. This is the second night in a row we have seen them. Will be looking again tonight.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It moved to three different spots in a matter of seconds. I quickly went inside to get my DV video camera and when I came back out of course it was gone. The strobe light of a small plane approaching from the southwest caught my eye. Noticing that it was a plane by the red and green wing lights I was going to go back inside when I noticed something to the left of the plane. I pointed my camera at it and caught what seems to be a triangular craft approaching the plane from the left. I came closer to the plane and then seemed to move at the same speed. I continued videoing it until they both dissappeared to the north east. It may be nothing, but no one can explain it.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I could see the island or Cozumel in the distance.  Then a blueish light caught my eye. The light color was similar to the color of kindergarten finger-paint blue, but it was different and probably  the most beautiful blue that I have ever seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The craft itself appeared to be very large now that I think of it. I would estimate its speed to be about 500mph. I never actually saw the craft, however I do not think that it would be any shape other than cigar, as described in the questionnaire above. It moved soundlessly through the air. I was surrounded by the blueish haze described in the previous paragraph. My personal belief is that the &#34;haze&#34; was just the effect of the lights mounted on the craft shining through the clouds that the craft was passing through. I felt a small charge of static electricity in the air, as if I rubbed a balloon on my hair.<n> <n><n> <n><n> These details seem unimportant to me, but as you said to include everything, I will.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object appeared suddenly, without any prior indication of an approaching object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> According to reliable sources aurora were particularly far-reaching that year.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There is an EXTREMELY SMALL possibility that the object released a water craft, because I saw a long, thin object in the water, however it was mos likely a Barracuda.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

I couldn&#39;t tell for sure how far away it was from me but it seemed just farther than my house and above the small town nearest to where i live about a mile south from me.  I saw it and thought, &#34;Wow!  That is a huge shooting star!&#34; but I realized within a second that it was stationary and many different bright colored lights all together in a ball.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was getting close to around 7 p.m. and in August it is still fairly light that time of day in the summer, but it was growing dusky.  So, this bright ball of light was very pronounced in the sky as it was incredibly bright compared to the rest of the sky.  I would say it was like a bunch of colored lights all melded together and rapidly changing because there is no other way to describe it.  I immediately grew very nervous becuase it was so large.  It was about the size of a baseball to me from around 2 miles away.  I had a friend in the car with me and she saw it as well.  We both stared at the object until all of a sudden it rapidly fell or flew or by some means moved very quickly downward to the right and then vanished.  I have never in my life seen anything like this before or after.  The only conclusion I could come out of it with was that it was some sort of UFO.<n>
8/24/04 15:30|Denver|CO|Cylinder|1 minute|Extremely bright small cylinder almost stationary in clouds abo e Denver.|9/1/04|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/038/S38896.html|124|ndxe200408| Extremely bright small cylinder almost stationary in clouds abo e Denver.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Because of two other sightings in and around Denver, I&#39;d like to mention the following event.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I stepped outside the two-story building in which I work to take a break and checkthe weather.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was standing in the shadow cast by the two-story building just soouth of the one I work in. (A narrow parking lot separates the builidngs).<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I looked up into an area of the sky a little west and maybe north of where the sun was, behind the building, I saw a definite cylinder or elongated white light. It was in or surrounded by some brown hazy clouds with no defiinition.  This bright white cyllinder appeared to be a plane, except that it was not moving along as it should, if it were a plane. It repeatedly disappeared and reappeared as if it might have been in this small patch of brownish haze.  Outside this hazy area were small clouds with some brilliant highlights as they reflected the nearby sun.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Not sure if during the observation period the light might have drifted sligthly southward, toward the edge of the roof which blocked my view of the sun. but it seemed to be in basically one place, which caught my attention because the smaller clearly defined clouds, unlike the slight haze, were moving northward while the light seemed to be in the same spot or slightly drifting the other way from the spot where I tried to place my initial observation.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After maybe a minute the cylindrical light finally disappeared and did not reappear and a small cloud just to the west brightened intensely from the sunlight and this bright cloud started to burn my eyes so I looked away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Possibly the cylinder was a balloon, if they can resemble the oblong &#34;tailhook&#34; type of years ago. It&#39;s bright illuminationn was similar to the nearby small clouds.  The bright light definitely contrasted with the kind of haze in the area where it was located.  Its reappearing and disappearance would be consistent with passing through the haze, if the haze had varying thickness.<n> <n><n> <n><n> But the object appeared to be a solid because it held its definite, narrow, small cylindrical shape each time it reappeared, unlike the clouds which were larger, more round and constantly shifting shape with wisps as clouds do.<n> <n><n> <n><n> i did not contact the local FAA, as suggested when I posted s multi-person sighting over Denver a year or two ago because the FAA person I spoke too was a little rude and obviously did not want ot be bothered with questions about wind speed, cloud elevations at the time of interest.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I merely post this in case someone else happened to see this unusual bright, slender object that was above and slightly south of overhead (5 or 10 degrees) and a little west of the sun at 3:30 p.m. when viewed from Downtown Denver, about four blocks west of Broadway.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I add the sky not covered by clouds or this patch of haze surrounding the cylinder was a deep and vivid  blue on this particular afternoon.  And, thinking back, I add that the hazy kind of light brownish-gray haze in the vicinity of the cylinder was different from the dominant blue sky and the bright clouds and wisps scattered around.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
8/24/04 05:45|Long Beach|MS|Light|3 MINUTES|The lights moved in reverse, forward, up and down.|9/9/04|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/039/S39129.html|125|ndxe200408| The lights moved in reverse, forward, up and down.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On a Tuesday morning, August 24, 2004, at approximately 5:45 a.m. I was driving to work when I saw a light in the sky in the southern hemisphere. I had stopped my truck just a short distance before reaching the end of my road to adjust my seat since my son had used the truck the night before and had repositioned it for himself. This is when I first saw the light. I didn&#39;t think much of it since I see planes all the time. After adjusting my seat I continued driving a short distance (about 60 ft.) before reaching the stop sign where I&#39;d turn left (east) to go to work. Once I stopped at the stop sign I noticed something unusual about the light...now there were about 8-10  lights real close together in a arch or 3/4 shaped shaped round pattern (there were lights inside the &#39;arch&#39; too) . I thought this is weird. Then these lights went in reverse, forward, up and down and were blinking at an extremely rapid pace...or at least much faster than a plane light . The lights were blinking independent of one another..not all at the same time...each point of light about the size of a round pencil eraser and were about 30 degrees above the tree leval. They looked like they were close to the beach even though I couldn&#39;t tell for sure since a wooded area faced me. I thought &#34;Oh my God...what is this&#34;?!! Then they slowly drifted below the horizon. From my position there are woods facing me just across the road where I was stopped which extend southward for about a mile or less...beyond that are subdivisions. The beach/Gulf of Mexico is only about 6 minutes south of my home and I work about 3 minutes from home. The fire station is in between my house and work. I asked one of the firemen who comes regularly in the store where I work if he&#39;d seen these lights. He just made fun of me and laughed about me seeing an u.f.o. Funny thing is I never said it was an u.f.o....I just said they were strange lights which moved in an erratic pattern.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Now here comes an even weirder part to this scene. I had a dream just before waking up that morning about visiting my Mom in the hospital. She has been deceased since 1996. I don&#39;t recall any conversation in the dream. however I remember feeling tired in the dream and decided to lay down on the lounge chair (in the dream) that extends out to form a mini &#39;bed&#39;. I was laying on my side facing the wall when I felt a hand touch the back of head. Then the hand touched my upper back. Then I felt these hands and arms scoop under my body and lift me up VERY gently. I never felt any fear. What I felt was a VERY LOVING male presence caring for me. When he lifted me up it felt as though it was completely effortless...like there was no gravity beneath me...I guess like a floating sensation even though I could still feel these arms beneath my body. Then the dream ended. I woke up, dressed for work, got in my truck and WHAM...the lights appeared!!  Mrs. ((name and contact information deleted))<n>
8/24/04 04:00|San Diego|CA|Light|2.5 hrs.|Bright objects seen for extended periods on cloudy night.|9/1/04|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/038/S38877.html|126|ndxe200408| Bright objects seen for extended periods on cloudy night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Bright hovering lights, observed in front of some low hanging clouds. The brightest of the objects was low on NW of field of view, other objects were scattered in a sort of triangular/chevron pattern spanning from NW to SW. Would easily have been identified as stars if not for a couple of obvious problems. The brightest and 2nd brightest remained visible inside of and in front of a large cloud formation and cast a glow inside of their respective clouds (glow in front of and behind). The brightest one would grow dull to the naked eye to the point of dissapearing completely and then become as bright as a high powered flashlight pointed at the eye from perhaps a distance of yards (very hard to discribe). The @nd brightest object (when observed by binoculars) appeared to have a small faint red object fly from it at an amazing speed. This was also witnessed by 2 friends, one roused from sleep, and the other at his night job where the light pollution made it possible for him to only see the bright one. The shapes were difficult to determine as they were very indistinct. The largest reminded me of a cylinder and then at times as a trapazoidal object, the others were the same but smaller or perhaps farthur. The small faint red dot was only witnessed by myself through the binoculars.The bright object is also in the sky now (05:12 on the 25 clear sky conditions). A smaller color flashing object is also present to it&#39;s south closer to the horizon. When the object is at it&#39;s brightest it is unmistakably 3 dimensional. I live close to the border of the Miramar base and many things have been observed over the years. I am usually held to skepticism but my curiosity has made me search for some enlightenment. I have scoured the web trying to find an astronomical answer and cannot. I do not use any kinds of drugs but am an ardent night owl. I&#39;ve never reported anything at all and truly believe I&#39;ve seen something unusual and hope that other people can give me some insight. I have met others from this area with similar stories.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We do not know what the witness observed.  Ordinarily, we would have guessed that a sighting of a bright object might have been Venus, but Venus is not in the northwest sky at this hour.  PD))<n>

All of a sudden I saw what I woulda swore was a huge plane landing in this filed out back of our house behind a set of woods. It was huge and had blue, red, green, and yellow flashing lights.  We watched it for a second, dumb founded wondering why the hell would such a large plane be landing back there unless it was in trouble. So we ran upstairs to my office to get a better view over the trees and saw the thing rise up real quick then just kinda hover then bam it shot off to the north and was gone. Then about 15 minutes after that this big bright white light just appeared further off in the distance and stayed there for a bit and then started moving to the left and right then it shot up a ways, sat there, and then bam it too was gone. During the time the large craft was in our sight our satellite television kept screwing up, the picture going all frazzled. When the bright white light appeared later our Satellite went out again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;m going up on our roof tonight with our video camera as I have spoken to two other people who have seen this that didn&#39;t know of my experience before telling me theirs. Hopefully I can catch something on tape.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I had tried to go to sleep but for some reason, I was suddenly full of energy even though  half an hour ago I was wiped. I went down to the kiychen to get a glass of water. As I drank it I glanced through the window at the lake. It was breath-taking as the moon light was reflected on the surface. Then I notied something moving. It looked like a number of bright objects were racing all over the water surface. Then it hit me, the images I was watching were reflections! I glanced upat the night sky and what I saw I will never forget, six to nine blurry lights were dancing through the night sky. At first I thought they were just spot lights or northern lights. But I soon realized that neitherof them could be going as fast or as bright as the objects I was watching. I dashed inside to wake my family. We watched the lights, fascinated for 5 minutes while my uncle went to grab a telescope.This was a very nice telescope and on clear nights could see mars as a reddish light. So he came running back with this telescope and peered through it. We all in turn looked at the dancing lights and I can only describe them as roundish balls emiting a bright pale green colour. We did not seem them in huge detail but enough that I could be sure that they were nothing man-made.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The lights pranced across the sky for a while longer until they receded up into the black oblivion of space. The very next morning, crop circles had appeared right under the lights. I do not know to believe weither it was a very elaborate prank or, it was actually real ufo&#39;s. But I find it difucult to believethat humans could have made crop circles that intricate as the ones we saw the lights dancing above on that memorable night.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was about 75 degrees up to the north of the road.  There were 4 white lights, about 1.5 the birghtness of venus in a line along what appeared to be the back over a distance of about 1.5x the diameter of a full moon.  Centered on the 4 back lights about the diameter of the moon away was another white light.  About half way between the single light and the middle of the 4 lights there was one red light, slightly brighter than the white ones.  It appeared to be facing west(the single white light was to the west of the 4 white ones.  It did not appear to be moving at all at this time(about 45 seconds).  I exited onto I-85 south and went south ~2 miles and turned around at that exit and went back to try and find a place where I could get out to look at it safely.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I arrived back it was to the south of I-185.  It was moving very slowly south parallel to I-85. It was at about 65 degrees up.  From this angle there were 2 white lights, the same distance apart as the farthest of the line of 4, and there was a red light, about 1/4 the diamater of the moon above the middle of the white lights. I watched it for about a minute, while glancing at road enough to stay on it(wide interstate, so not much).  I glanced at the road and looked back.  It was gone.  It is possible that it flew into a cloud, because it wasn&#39;t too far from the moon in the sky which was temporarly behind a cloud.  The cloud moved on leaving a clear sky in the direction.  I turned around and headed back towards 85 then south.

We are at an altitude of 6,000 feet and the lights were higher and just to the west of the mountains. Looking through binoculars the lights were solid with no other lights in,on,or around them. The two lights behaved like the Phoenix lights, fading in and out for some thirty minutes and appeared in three locations. (I have seen the Phoenix lights).  There were aircraft in the vicinity.  The lights did not behave like flares.  The night was partially cloudy,stars visible and the almost first half of the moon. We will continue to watch.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Midlothian, IL is a southwest suburb just due East of Tinley Park. Since my child&#39;s home is near the train tracks we normally hear the loud sounds of freight trains. At first we thought it was a train. Then we heard a large roar and suddennly a huge unmarked beige colored military helicopter that looked a lot like the old Soviet HIND helicopters used in Afghanistan, roared just 20 feet over her residential rooftop heading West, Southwest towards the direction of Tinley Park, IL. I was very shocked to see an unmarked miltitary aircraft flying so low over the buildings. My child was delighted. So this is not an actual UFO report but rather a piece of coraborating information that maybe some governmental agency knew something was going on in Tinley Park.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

There was afternoon night and the sky was very cloudy.  The object was moving sideways in a straight and unaltered path. almost like an airplane. but there was no wings, no lights, and it was not shaped as such. i could not tell if there was any sound due to my radio being on. I though at first it must have been a large ballon, but it didn&#39;t seem to be one b/c: at that height it could have not been that large, it was not moving with the slight breeze, b/c it was moving so straight, i was driving my car so i could not keep a constant stare but with each look away it seemed to move quickly, almost but not nearly as fast as an airplane, such as a bush plane. I am not sure what it was, since i am not experienced in this type of situation. but it was quite unusual. i hope that anyone else driving next to me will be able to report. thank you.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((name deleted)) Tega Cay, S.C.<n>

Having seen numerous anomalous sightings from my patio looking east in recent weeks, I scanned the sky for another.  Within moments I saw a &#34;fast-mover,&#34; a dim sphere travelling due south at a good clip -- a bit faster than, say, a jet or a satellite.  Through binocs, it was circular and reminiscent of the others I&#39;ve seen recently, appearing to reflect the sun a bit.  It was halfway between horizon and zenith to the east.  As I watched it through binocs, it travelled into a feathery cloud, and I didn&#39;t see it come out the other side.  Lowering the binocs, I noted that the cloud was not very large at all, so it was odd that the object didn&#39;t come out the other side, and I looked but couldn&#39;t find it with the naked eye either.  I noted that the clouds, which appeared to be cirrus and rather sparse, thus higher than cumulus clouds, were moving slowly northward.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Just a few moments later, at 3 PM, I saw this object or another one which seemingly suddenly appeared almost directly overhead.  It was shining as bright as Vega but in the daytime sky.  It remained absolutely motionless, mimicking a star, for about 3 minutes, while clouds approached slowly from the south.  Through binocs it appeared to be a perfectly circular, white object, with the typical thin crescent of darker &#34;shadow&#34; area on its side opposite the sun.  It remained steady and very bright as I gazed at it through binoculars.  I lowered the binocs briefly as a cloud moved into the area of the sphere, and then looked again through binocs.  Now I noticed what I thought was something different -- a solid BLACK sphere moving through the cloud.  (Since the cloud itself was moving, for the moment I couldn&#39;t tell if the apparent movement of the object was an illusion or real.)  However, I soon saw that it was the same apparent object, only when it was in front of the clouds it was pure black, and when it moved out of the cloud (or the cloud moved away from it) it became instantly pure white again against the blue sky.  I watched as the apparent colour changed instantaneously.  If this foreground/background colour change is a known phenomenon with rubber balloons, I&#39;ve never known of it before; anyway the object did not appear to be a balloon.  At 3.05 I noticed it had moved from its stationary position just south of an overhead wire to the north, by several degrees, and then it started heading to the east/northeast rather slowly, until by about 3.08 it had passed behind some trees and continued out of sight, now lower than half-way between horizon and zenith as it travelled away from me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We express our gratitude to this MUFON member for submitting the report.

At approximately 4:45 a.m., PST, I woke and witnessed four circular objects hovering over the Pacific Ocean to the west of my location, most likely about 3-4 miles out to sea. I observed them for several minutes, expecting them to get closer if they were airplanes. I also looked for flashing lights, simliar to those on aircraft. I could see no movement, and no lights. The objects seemed to remain stationairy, and did not move closer to my location. They appeared in formation, one lighting up at a a time. When I first caught a glimpse of them, only three appeared. Then a fourth appeared to the far north. The objects switched places several times, then slowly, one by one, the lights began to fade out, starting with the light farthest north, ending with the light farthest south. Several times the light to the north faded, then reappeared. Given the speed of the movement in which the objects changed places, I suspect they are most likely aircraft of some kind, possibly helicopters. No noise could be heard, however, and the entire event lasted only 10 minutes or so.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I have a hammock up there, and I went up to have a smoke. I looked up as I always do when I smoke out there. I saw movement, looked like just another star, but moving. This object had to be way up there, it was a size of a small star. No blinking lights, no color, just looked like every other star up there, except it moved, and moved and stopped ever so often. I followed this movement , thinking it was a satlite ( which I have seen, they move in a straight line, and also look like a normal star, I see these often when I camp in the rockies) but the movement was all over, not supper fast, but the speed would decrease and increase, or even just stop. So this object, I followed, and then another one caught me eye, its the movement of these objects that catches your eye. Now there are two objects, I watched the two objects fly, and stop, fly and stop. Again no flashing lights, WAY to high up to be a plane, the movement is something i&#39;ve never seen ever in my life! I watched till the two objects flew behind a high cloud thin cloud that was over partially over downtown. When I camp , the view of the stars is clear, but downtown there is light pollution. I took this into consideration, but the MOVEMENT , the stopping, the different speeds. I&#39;m very skeptical person, dont buy into this hollywood, saucer, green little men thing. But what I saw last night had me a bit worried. Maybe other people saw this event, but again, its not obvious just looking up at the stars. I was watching the sky for serveral minutes before I saw movement and the objects. No noise, no beams, nothing of that nature, they were the size of small stars, very high up, and the same color of the surrounding stars ( probably due to them being so high up, that the sun reflects back just like the stars).<n> <n><n> <n><n>

We decided to take a little break and just gaze at the stars for a moment. It was a good idea because we saw a couple of shooting stars. About 3 minutes later i noticed an extremely faint light around where i saw a falling star just moments ago. It was odd because it appeared to be extremely farther away farther than a satellite we just saw go bye. So we knew it couldnt be a satellite. It would flash rapidly and stop for 5-10 seconds then reappear. For the first 30 seconds i was watching it, it was stationary. Then it began to move at a pretty rapid speed across the sky. It made its way half way across the sky then and made a almost a complete u-turn and darted off in the other direction. That night it was crystal clear, clearer than it has been in a long while. And where he lives the is no light polution what so ever. We gaze at stars on a constant basis, but this is the first time we saw anything of the sort. It was a very dim flashing white light moving quitely, eratically, and misteriously across the sky. The funny part is, we saw no more shooting stars after that. The light the object emitted waz very faint and hazy to see<n>

My brother was the first to spot it. At first glance, it was hard to even see it, but over a period of about 5 to 10 minutes, it grew more intense. I yelled for my parents to come outside with the binoculars, and we each took turns looking at the apparent U.F.O. over the next several minutes. As I said, at first it was a dim light, but as it grew more intense, you could see through the binoculars that it had 3 lights in a triangular fashion that would appear, disappear, and reappear; almost as if it was rotating in a fixed position in the sky. It continued to do this until the craft departed, leaving a vapor trail, at an angle going upward and westward. Right before it disappeared for good, my brother was the one who had the binoculars at the time, and he claimed that the craft, or whatever it was seemed to morph and appeared as an iridescent disc, shining red, blue, green, and yellow, before zipping off. I am not sure if it was a coincidence, but at the moment that the craft disappeared, a jet flying at a lower altitude than the craft was flying across the sky in the same vicinity as the U.F.O.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous.

I was sitting facing northeast and as always, I searched the skies for anomalies. I noticed an object at approximately 60 degrees above the horizon. The object appeared to be circular and reflective. As I was watching the object, I was trying to figure out if it was a balloon or perhaps a star. I pointed the object out to the 3 other people I was with (we all adults late 30’s to early 40’s) and 2 out of the 3 others were able to see it. As I was watching this object for a 4-5 minute period, I also noticed another fainter object the right at about 30 degrees higher.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The 2 others and myself were discussing what might this be (alternating looking at each other and back at the object) when out of my left peripheral vision I saw a reflective object move by at an accelerated speed. When I looked up to where I originally saw the object, the object was gone, as well as the fainter object. I am not sure if what I saw was the object itself moving swiftly by, or if it was something else like a translucent insect reflecting the sun light high up in the sky (I didn’t get a good feel on the actual altitude)?  I am just wondering if anyone else saw this object and I will keep checking back to see if anyone else reports anything.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous.

(we live approx. 50 yards from highway 67).<n> <n><n> <n><n> As it fluttered by I noticed a white circle hovering high above not moving for about five minutes, then slowly moved up and hovered some more. The second move, made the object appear to rise as it got smaller. I live close to gillespie field airport, and I&#39;m not a professional, but this was not a plane or balloon. This was broad daylight. We observed this object 10-15 min. with binoculars and digital camera.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It still appeared round. I took three pictures of the area hoping to catch it, and then a picture of a small cessna aircraft for reference. The first three pics showed nothing. Strangley the cessna pic has a strange object near it, not seen when taking the photo. Oddly enough I saw the same object today, from La Mesa at 1600 or 4:00pm. My wife was in the bank when I went to open the rear of our Jeep for air, to be honest it startled me see the same white hovering circle. It moved over highway 8 very high 50,000 ft. north two times at five minute or so intervals then became smaller and rose out of sight. This was no drifting weather balloon, it moved with purpose. I&#39;d be glad to E-mail you the pic with the Cessna and object, and the others too, but I couldn&#39;t find it in the pics, I&#39;m sure you have better photo enhancement programs.

As we traveled on the desolate highway South, a bright green light went over us, very low to the ground and at a high rate of speed moving south above the highway illuminating the area around us for a moment. We were very startled and I inadvertently drove off the road and stopped the car, yelling &#34;WHAT THE HELL WAS THAT!&#34; over and over. I reached under my coat and took a hold of my 1911 pistol instinctively and then thought, “Yeah right”. As for the object itself, it was very large and oval shaped and simply glowed green and was very low to the ground making no sound and moved at a high rate of speed disappearing over the hills to the south. And for the rest of the evening we were both perplexed by what we could not explain and which scared the hell out of us. I reported it to the US Air Force whom I believe thought that I was making it all up.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD))<n>

We are at 171st and 94th Ave. From our view they appeared one above the other with a third light further south. They slowly moved to form a perfect diagonal line, then one by one they just disappeared. We watched for about 20 - 30 minutes. Then, a few minutes later we saw one red light reappear and this time it only lasted a minute or so, then disappeared. Have read other reports and see many descriptions of the lights forming a triangle. I would guess these sitings are more directly underneath the lights than we were. The whole time they pulsated - getting brighter and softer. With binoculars they looked like lights with rays coming off the top and sides but that could be due to the binoculars. Who has video of this?? Did anyone see news reports?<n>

He called my husband and I. We went to the backyard (facing east).  We looked up into the sky (a little bit southeast)and at that time that we stepped outside, we saw a triangle of three bright red lights.  They seemed to be high up in the sky, and yet so big and red and bright.  I did not see any &#34;craft&#34; per se.  Then the three lights went into an alignment and one by one within the next few minutes, the lights disappeared into the sky. It looked to me as if they disappeared upward, but I cannot be sure.  I am not positive about the date except that it happened in August. I&#39;m glad to be able to report this. There was an article that appeared in our local paper regarding this sighting with your website address.  At the time that it happened, we looked that week on a NASA website, looked in our newspapers, etc. and didn&#39;t see anything about it. Whatever it was, it was very perplexing and like nothing I had ever seen before.  ((name deleted))<n>

As we were looking at the sky we noticed a blinking &#34;star&#34;, as we watching this &#34;star&#34; we noticed that it was waving back and forth. After watching the craft dash in and out and side to side and up and down we called my brother and his wife to look at the object to make sure we were not seeing anything that wasn&#39;t there, after 10 minutes of watching they both concluded that it had to be an ufo for the way that it was moving.  While still watching it, about 1 hour into it we noticed that all of the little &#34;stars&#34; around it were blinking sparatically as if back and forth to eachother.  Keeping our eyes on the whole scene of the sky we noticed that these little &#34;stars&#34; were also moving and jolting slightly, and they would come and go as if just disappearing.  The objects seemed to be communicating with eachother by blinking lights that seemed to be either red or white or both sometimes, they would all come and go and they all did move around the sky.  We watched the objects for approximately 3 hours and at some points only 2 would be within eyesight and at other times up to 20 could be seen moving.  I have always been a sceptic until that night, in all 8 people saw everything that I have told you and everyone would tell you the same thing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We wonder whether the witnesses might have been looking at a celestial body, possibly Sirius, in the northeastern sky.

At points the lights got brighter and dimer, and it appeared to be in sequence, as in when 1 would get dimmer, the other would be bright, and the other would get brighter as the other would go dimmer. I dont know the time the lights appeared, but I witnessed them for about 15 to 20 minutes as the moved across the sky slowly. Thier altitude appeared to be far to high to be a helecopter and we heard no noise. 5 of my friends and I were at a car show when we witnessed it and we could not conclude what they were. There were about 30-40 other people and none of them could figure it out either, people were taking photos with thier camera phones and cameras, one person video taped it, but when we asked him he said &#34;what the hell are those things, when I try to zoom in on them, they dont show up on my camera&#34;. I have absolutely no idea what they could have been, and I would really like to find out. This occured also at what appeared to be extreamly high above the gound, and it occured near one of the largest flight paths for either O&#39;Hare or Midway Airports in Chicago. The only thing I could possibly think they were would be someone on the ground with very powerful ground based lazers, but there were no clouds for them to reflect off of. The objects appeared to leave a small trail when they left, but it was hard to confirm this, since I only saw 2 disappear, and only looked for a trail when the last one left.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Please see other reports for this date.

I am an avid amateur astronomer with over 12 years experience (and an attorney of 18 years experience).  On the evening of August 21, 2004, I was setting up an 8&#34; schmidt-cassegrain &#34;go to&#34; scope on my deck when I noticed a strikingly bright red circular light (it was slightly smaller than the size of Mars when that object was at its largest in the sky in late August 2003)just a few degrees west of Polaris.  It did not twinkle; it had a constant (to my eyes) brightness.  The light&#39;s magnitude was similar to that of Jupiter&#39;s when that object is viewed on an exceptional viewing night.  The light really caught my eye, as nothing as large and luminous as it was should have been in that portion of the sky.  The viewing conditions were excellent (e.g., no clouds whatsoever, stable atmoshpere, and even with my eyesight (and this is saying a lot) I could easily discern (without telescopic aid) the split between Mizar and Alcor in the Big Dipper&#39;s handle.  I rushed my set up of the telescope, hoping to at least see the light in the telescope&#39;s finder scope, but the red light rapidly (in just 1-2 seconds) turned white and just as quickly disappeared, before I could get my telescope on it.  I was intrigued, but figured that my eyes had just played a trick on me (you know how people confuse stars and planets for ufos!!).  As the red light I have described was no longer visible, I began my evening&#39;s observing, bouncing around between different stars and messier objects, etc.  Oddly enough, after about 30 minutes or so it occurred to me that I had not seen the lights of a single aircraft since I started the evening&#39;s viewing (that was very unusual, as I live in an area where flights out of Midway Airport are frequently overhead, and small aircraft are quite frequent, as well).  That puzzled me, but I just went back to my viewing.  Around 2330 or so, I took a break from the telescope and noticed what appeared to be the lights of an aircraft approaching from roughly northeast and heading roughly southwest - but the familiar green and red, starboard and port lights I expected to see weren&#39;t there.  Instead, there were two very well definded circular red lights that ran an equidistant, and parallel course (as near as I could tell, slightly farther apart in distance than an average airliner&#39;s running lights).  I cannot tell you what altitude those lights were at, and although they passed through a good amount of sky, they passed out of view quickly.  I heard no sounds one would ordinarily associate with aircraft of any kind when I saw any of the lights I have described in this report.  I am only sending you this report because: (i) a non-lawyer coworker who lives in Tinley Park and knows of my astronomy hobby asked me Monday morning if I had observed anything unusual in the sky Saturday evening.  When I told him I had (and without telling him about the lights I had seen), he related to me that he and his wife had seen an odd red light in hee sky Saturday night, that he had told other coworkers of he and his wife&#39;s experience, that the other coworkers thought he was nuts, and that he wanted me to verify for them that there had been an unusual odd red light in the sky Saturday night (I did); and (ii) I read the reports of equal viewing date on this site that came in from Tinley Park, Illinois, which is the town adjacent to where I live.  I would like to note that when I broke down my telescope and brought it back inside my home on Saturday evening, I did not tell my wife of nearly 30 years of the red lights I had seen, but that I did tell her about the absence of air traffic, and that I then went back outside and watched the sky for about another 30 minutes - and saw no aircraft.  Highly unusal.  I have no idea what the red lights were, or why air traffic seemed to be nonexistent (at least from my vantage point) that evening, but must say that that evening provided me with the most unusual viewing experience I have ever had.

8/21/04 22:45|Montreal (Canada)|QC|Circle|15 min.|J'avais jamais vu en 31 ans d'existence quelconque forme effectué des virages a 45 degrés dans les airs de facon aussi prononcé !|9/1/04|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/038/S38874.html|173|ndxe200408| J&#39;avais jamais vu en 31 ans d&#39;existence quelconque forme effectué des virages a 45 degrés dans les airs de facon aussi prononcé !<n> <n><n> <n><n> ( french text sorry )  J&#39;étais au Hilton de la place Bonaventure , dans le centre-ville de MOntreal , pour y celebrer le mariage d&#39;un ami ... Il etait dans les alentours de Onze heure , Onze heure moins quart , quand je decida d&#39;aller sur la terrasse exterieur pour y prendre un peu d&#39;air !  donc je suis sur la terrasse , il est tard , il fait noir dehors ... mon attention est attirée vers les etoiles ! Elles sont belles ce soir , car la temperature a descendu de quelques degrés et cela a eu pour effet de chasser toute l&#39;humidité dans l&#39;air , et malgré l&#39;eclairage des grattes-ciel , le ciel est etonnament clair .<n> <n><n> <n><n> Je continue a regarder dans les airs quelques instants , et a un moment donné je vois un corps semblable a une étoile se deplacer , en ligne droite ... Ah! me dis-je ... il doit s&#39;agir d&#39;un de ces petits spoutniks qui se dirige a haute altitudes et que l&#39;on voit a l&#39;occasion ...<n> <n><n> <n><n> Quoique etonné de voir un spoutnik filé a cette allure et dans ce ciel quand-meme eclairé de la ville , je continua a regarder les étoiles en tentant d&#39;expliquer dans ma tete pourquoi ce spoutnik la allait si vite ... c&#39;est vrai d&#39;habitude un spoutnik ( ou n&#39;importe quel satellite du meme genre ) quand on le voit c&#39;est generalement dans un ciel noir , et ca se deplace tres lentement , mais lui il etait visible dans le ciel de montreal , et filait a la vitesse d&#39;un avion dans les airs ...<n> <n><n> <n><n> Est-ce un avion me demandais-je ? Non impossible , un avion a cette distance la je ne le verrais meme pas , et si au contraire , il s&#39;agissait d&#39;un effet d&#39;optique quelconque et qu&#39;effectivement il aurait été plus prés de moi que je l&#39;eu cru , j&#39;aurais donc vue ses feux de routes vert et rouge aux extremitées des ailes ... Non ce n&#39;etait pas un avion !  Bah ... ca doit etre un super spoutnik qui va vite finalement ... ou encore un de ces fameux ballons meteologiques qu&#39;ont ne voit jamais , mais qu&#39;ont entend parler a l&#39;occasion !  je continue a regarder les étoiles , a la recherche d&#39;une étoile filante ou d&#39;un autre spoutnik ...<n> <n><n> <n><n> Tient me dis-je ... quel est donc cette étoile qui file a vive allure ... Une Étoile filante peut-etre ... ( je la regarde , et je la lacherai pas des yeux jusqu&#39;au moment ou elle vas disparaitre de mon champ de vision ) , et comme elle allait disparaitre de mon champ de vision , comme ca , tout d&#39;un coup , sans raison ... Elle change brusquement de direction ( PAF ! ) une étoile filante qui tourne dans un angle de 45 degrés comme ca ! Je continue a regarder cet evenement que je ne verrai peut-etre jamais plus , en me disant ... serait-ce un ovni ?  Ce qui semblait etre une étoile filante au tout debut , se promenait maintenant d&#39;une facon aleatoire dans le ciel de montreal , en changeant de direction soit de facon brusque , soit d&#39;une facon douce et courbée ... Completement atteré je continua a regarder ce phénomène extraordinaire , sans le quitter des yeux ... Car je me fous de savoir si je suis le seul a le voir , de toute facon dans ce genre de situation , quand on quitte pour avertir les gens , les phénomènes sont toujours disparues au retour ... non pas question que je manque ce spectacle ...<n> <n><n> <n><n> Toujours la tete dans les airs , mon attention est attirée pour d&#39;autres déplacements ( d&#39;autres ? ) Effectivement , il y en avait d&#39;autres ... je me mis a regarder ces autres corps dans le ciel se deplacer de la meme maniere que le corps precedent , en effectuant le meme genre de virages ... j&#39;etais dorénavant plus qu&#39;attéré , j&#39;etais sidéré !!!!  Je continua a suivre du regard chacun des deplacements des corps , et un moment donné un des corps passa au travers d&#39;un enorme jet de lumiere crée par un edifice a coté d&#39;ou j&#39;etais ... Un édifice comportant quatres gros projecteurs , aux quatres coins de sa structure , et projeté vers le ciel , vers un point quelconque de l&#39;espace ! Le corps quoique haut , etait aussi visible dans ce jet de lumiere , que lorsqu&#39;il n&#39;y etait pas du tout ... mais c&#39;est malgré tout a ce moment la que je remarqua quelque chose d&#39;étrange ...<n> <n><n> <n><n> La forme de déplacant dans le ciel , et qui passa au travers de l&#39;énorme jet de lumiere , me donnait le meme impression que si c&#39;etait un oiseau , mais vu d&#39;extremement haut !!!  Un Oiseau pensais-je ? Voyons donc un oiseau , on voit ca le jour a cet distance la , jamais la nuit ... j&#39;ai vu des chauve-souris l&#39;autre soir qui m&#39;ont passées a moins de 5 pieds de la tete et c&#39;est a peine si j&#39;avais eu le temps de les apercevoir , mais la un oiseau ?? nahhh c&#39;est improbable me dis-je !  Quoique ce mouvement qui ressemblait de loin a un battement d&#39;aile , aurait pu aussi etre celui d&#39;un corps enveloppé d&#39;une structure d&#39;ou emanait ( peut-etre ) des tourbillons de couleurs ? A cette foutue distance je ne voyais pas assé bien ... Si j&#39;avais emmené mon appareil photo aussi ... peut-etre qu&#39;avec le zoom , j&#39;aurais pu distinguer d&#39;une facon plus nette me repetais-je !!!  Tout en ne lachant pas du regard ces formes lumineuses semblables a des étoiles se déplacer dans le ciel , sans tenir compte des lois physiques je continua a me questionner ...<n> <n><n> <n><n> De toute facon , un oiseau , ca tourne pas a 45 degrés comme sur un 10 cennes me dis-je . Comment diable un oiseau pourrait il etre aussi loin , aussi brillant , aussi rapide , aussi brusques dans ses virages ... non je n&#39;ai jamais vu en trente ans d&#39;ancienneté sur cette planete un oiseau effectué de tels virages ... non ce n&#39;est definitivement pas un oiseau !!!  Et pendant mes longs questionnements , je regardais les formes partir et revenir , tourner , se suivre et se separer , et puis graduellement plus rien ... Ils etaient ailleurs , ou il etaient partis ? J&#39;allais profiter de ce moment de tranquillité pour avertir ma conjointe ...<n> <n><n> <n><n> Quelques minutes plus tard je du revenir seul , car ma conjointe etait sur que j&#39;etais en train d&#39;inventer des histoires ... Je m&#39;attendais un peu a cette reaction , car c&#39;est jamais bien evident de dire avec certitude qu&#39;on a vu un phenomène qui est autant peu pris au serieux , du au fait que l&#39;homme et son esprit critique n&#39;a pas eu souvent la chance de pouvoir analyser de facon logique de tels apparitions .<n> <n><n> <n><n> Je repris mon exploration du ciel , j&#39;en ai vu deux autres , qui cote-a-cote , se dirigeait dans un axe qui me semblait etre sud-nord , et a mesure qu&#39;ils avancaient , il se rapprochaient un de l&#39;autre , un peu comme la forme d&#39;un trapeze ... A un moment donné , plus rien ... cette fois ils etaient bien parties ...<n> <n><n> <n><n> Nous sommes finalement parti vers Onze heures trentre , pour retourner a la maison ... Le phenoméne tant qu&#39;a lui doit bien avoir duré une quinzaine de minute ou dumoins j&#39;ai eu la chance d&#39;y participer pendant une quinzaine ... et quand je suis arrivé a la maison , j&#39;ai bien re-essayer de les revoir , mais sans succes ...<n> <n><n> <n><n> Jamais pendant les 15 minutes de mon observations , les corps n&#39;ont eu d&#39;autres apparences que celles d&#39;étoiles , tant par la forme que par la couleur .<n> <n><n> <n><n>

A few seconds later the remaining three formed an almost perfect triangle and then disappeared (the lead one first, followed by the remaing two).<n> <n><n> <n><n> I do not believe these were aircraft b/c the lights were constant, resembling what a statellite looks like, plus there was no sound or vapour trail.  I also do not believe these lights were statellites, since on obviously changed course and the remaining three fluctuated in speed and laked the fluent, smooth movment consistent with a statellite.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Any comments on what I hav edescribed would be appreciated.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thank you, ((name deleted))  North Bay, ON<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We suspect that the three lights in a triangular formation may have been what are thought to be the U.

The formation looked like a backwards triangle with the two base points leading and the tip behind them seeming to go about as fast as a satellite.  The back light broke away from the formation about halfway through the event duration and headed south.  The other two that were leading did not change and kept on going east.  There was no sound heard.  The lights were small like stars so they could have been very high.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

My uncle had also pointed out blue lights, that were scattered accross the sky, one by the red lights, and the two others almost directly across from each other.

These lights appeared to slowly start moving east and were at extreamly high altitude, no sound, object was huge and avoided all existing stars perfectly so that none were blocked out as it traversed the clear sky. (Milky way was visible)  Object made a question mark course towards the southern sky where the lights quickly vanished before our eyes, it was as if the lights were turned off on purpose almost directly over us but slightly to the south.  I kept saying, that I can&#39;t believe it is missing all the other stars... so that we could see it block one out.  It came extreamly close to several stars that would have been blocked if the triangle would have been a perfect triangle, we were waiting to see if some of the object would block those, indicating a larger shape than the lights outlined, but this did not occur.  I am 48 years old ex-USAF electronics tech and the altitude was so high that the area inside the stars/lights appeared to be the same color as the space around it not darker as with a lower object.  I beleive this object should have been seen nationwide and could have been as large as several miles to several hundred miles across, if the altitude was 80+ miles to being in deep space.  It was if some thing took these stars and wanted to remove them from the sky, by sliding them off of the star map while no one was looking!  A slight variation in each of the star/light colors was visible a slight yellow, green/blue shift.  I can&#39;t beleive any observatories or radar installations did not catch this.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We suspect that the witness may have observed the three satellites, thought to be part of the U.

This was only discernable over a 15 minute time span as I believe they had to be very far away.  Until then It was hard to see any noticeable movement.  Upon Arriving home I noticed my neighbor staring up at the same objects and discussed it with him.  No noises were heard.  The air and water show I believe was this same weekend in Chicago.

CST I noticed a very odd phenomenon  over Interstate 90/94 southbound between Poynette, WI and DeForest, WI.  My wife and I were driving home from central Wisconsin from a friends cottage.  No alcohol or drugs were consumed at the outing. It was a very clear night and the stars were very visible.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My wife and I both noticed a bright white light in the sky.  She asked what it was and I responded jokingly, a UFO.  It was extremely bright and was composed of four lights in a row flying perpendicular to our line of travel.  At first we thought they must be landing lights on an airliner.  However the four lights in a row were not right.  Usually there is some separation between the lights. There was none.  Between us and the lights there was a microwave tower with a red light on it,  the lights appeared miles beyond the tower.  We passed the tower in about a quarter to half mile.  Then the lights started to descend.  I thought it might be a plane landing at the Dane county airport a few miles to the south.  But it wasn&#39;t turning toward the airport as it should have.  It proceeded straight across the highway about what initially looked to be about a quarter mile ahead of us.  It then came down very steeply and I though it was going to crash in the woods next to the highway.  Instead the lights dropped in intensity until it looked about the size of a flashlight.  It then winked out and appeared to land on the shoulder of the road directly to our right.  When it winked out it was the size of a computer keyboard and appeared to fly into the woods next to the road.  It was not a bird.  We could not stop as it was a crowded interstate and had a steep ditch next to the road.  We proceeded home to Madison and I filed this report.  It was definitely an Unconventional Flying Object.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

They were quite obviously not associated with any human-made craft, given the strange movement.  They moved far too slowly to be airplanes or helicopters.  There were four, and they hovered Zeppelin-like and blinking a pale yellow light.  They remained in the skies over Litchfield / So. Manchester for about 45 minutes.  The weather was foggy and humid after a day of steady rain.  After three quarters of an hour, the light disappeared.  No mention of anything peculiar was mentioned on local radio or TV.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

We pulled into the parking lot of the bar and noticed 3 people standing in the parking lot starring up at the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When we got out of the car we saw the 4 distinct red lights in the sky.  Three of them were in a triangle formation and one of them was out of formation.  They moved apart very slowly and each one eventually dimmed away until their were none.  My friend and I got back into the car and turned on a local talk radio station.<n> <n><n> <n><n> That is when we heard the announcement that the lights were F-16 afterburners lighting up.  This makes perfect sense because August 19-22 is the weekend of the Chicago Air and Water Show.  It&#39;s amazing to see how convincing the lights are.  We thought we were in the twilight zone... many people all standing around stopping what they are doing and looking up at the sky.

So I googled it and found all this information on it, including this website, it was really wierd, and really interesting because everything I read was exactly what I had seen. And its so hard to explain it to someone that didnt see it and still seem sane. But what happened was me and my gf at the time were outside talking and noticed these lights, one at first, then 3, they hovered in a way, coming very close together at times and then separating, moving in sparatic ways. It was shaped in a triangle at times but not always, and sometimes it was a close knit triangle and other times a very distance but still resembled a triangle triangle. Sometimes the lights were very bright red and other times dim, they did seem to turn white for a min or two, not very long though. Then finally the lights all came together into one and it was a bright red like hovering and finally it seemed to moved away from the earths atmosphere because it slowly got dimmer until you couldnt see the red light anymore. THere is NOO way this was an airplane as say by some agencies and governments. It honestly couldnt have been explained, they moved in such different and odd ways. Also anything with a motor (helicopers... whatever) would have been heard. you didnt hear anything and no distinct &#34;flying object&#34; was actually identified except for the lights. Not to mention there were 3 then they all came together... thats just odd. No man made object splits into three and comes back together to form one. We called a bunch of friends and people we knew and they all saw it too. we lived roughly at 181st and 84th ave in tinley park, Il.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date of the event may be approximate.

The lights were moving east, very slowly.  It looked like three separate objects all moving at the same speed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The three lights formed a triangular shape.  We observed this for about 15 minutes and the lights seemed to move closer together.  Two of the lights stayed together while the third red light moved away.

We could not see the other two anymore, either.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Since this site is asking for a description of my background, let me say that I am an educated, intelligent, and logical person.

We had just finished our block party.While we were chatting, I noticed 3 red lights in the sky just to the north of us. We were facing West, but I saw them out of the corner of my eye. So I faced North to get a better look. I watched them for a good 45 minutes.  One light was at 12 o&#39;clock, one at 6 o&#39;clock and one at about 7 .The objects were at a 45 degree angle from where I was standing.  It seemed to be about 5 or 6 miles away. I am on about 205th and 80th Ave. I didn&#39;t hear anything, but after we left the neighbors, I kept watching from my kitchen window. They seemed to get dimmer, and the one at 7 o&#39;clock was now even with the one at 12. Then they just kind of faded.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The lights were very bright at first, kind of like the ones on the power lines.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

On August 21st 2004 and I thought I should add to that story what was witnessed by me and my family.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was a beautiful evening. I was in my back yard in Oak Forest, IL.  With my wife, my two older brothers and my step son.   We were just hanging out enjoying the night when my oldest brother said &#34;check out those three red stars,&#34; and he pointed into the southern sky.  We all looked and noticed the three red lights that was probably described by a thousand people.  We saw them kind of hanging there, then moving in and out until, one by one they just kind of faded out. Not a sudden disappearance like turning off a light switch but rather a fade.  They would just fade slowly out. Shortly after that I noticed something strange in the northern sky.  There was this air ship (for a lack of a better term) that was moving from the north to the south.  This ship seemed to be moving slow but steady and as it got closer we got a real good look at it. It was black and shining and triangular. I could see the light from the surrounding townships reflecting off it or so it seemed. It seemed to be flying low also. Maybe two thousand feet off the deck, however I can’t say for sure. And it was silent. It didn’t make a sound, nothing at all and it was a real smooth flight path.  It didn’t deviate at all. It didn’t shake or anything. Just moving straight as an arrow.  Once it passed over our house (it was flying almost directly over our house) and headed out south it turned into one of those red lights for maybe three or four minutes and then faded like the other lights.  It was very strange to say the least.<n>

PD))<n> <n><n> <n><n> EXPLANATION:   All the many refineries surrounding the area have these enormous &#34;flares&#34; that rise as high as sky scrapers.  Unfortunately, the oil refineries like to burn off  or &#34;flare&#34; various gases (some very noxious) at night when there is less chance of them being reported for doing so.  Many of the flares run steady all day/night long but can increase or decrease in volume of flame emitted.  Under certain atmospheric conditions, i.e., low lying clouds on somewhat still and foggy nights, MANY people report seeing orange pillar shaped UFOs. Our local news stations have run these stories several times in the past to try to educate people, especially those who live to the southeast side of the city.  The orange flame colored light from the flare is seen to be projected in pillar like fashion vertically and can even look as though it is going up and through the low lying clouds that hang along this coastal region.  Many times people will report seeing this some distance away from the refineries.<n>

The lights were very visable, they stayed around for awhile, I think about 45 min. that I noticed, but maybe more or less. I think they were in the northern sky. I did not see anything except these red lights, there were always in the set of three. They were maybe 45 deg. in the horizon.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Could also not really tell difference in the light with or without bino&#39;s except when it flamed/faded out. The color definately changed from a red to a light red/orange before disappearing, almost like a match or amber when it goes out. Therefore, not an airplane, and not a stupid laser<n>

Several people saw this and believed that it was a UFO. I did too and took video of it. The wether conditions were not that great, there was light rain and low clouds. After reviewing the video and stepping outside to see it once more. We all concluded that it was not a ufo. First off most of us work at petrochemical plants and this reminded us of something. Usualy the when the large flares go off at the plant it makes some kind of a simmilar beam of light effect high over the flare. In that direction is one of the larger plants(Equistar) in the area and they had there largest flare on during that night. The beam of light had a haze around it, which could have been from the clouds around it or rain. The initial sighting was made at this location N25&#39;45.17  W95&#39;14.61 (WGS84). Direction of the Light from that point was northeast at 51&#39;m.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

There was no sound made by any.  There were no airplanes in the area which we are very familiar with as we get lots of Midway and Gary, Indiana flights overhead.  The lights appeared to make a triangular formation and hovered that way for a couple minutes.  I went into the house to get a camera and they were gone.  I thought that maybe the lights were from the Tweeter Center for a concert or something but there was nothing scheduled there at the time that would have used red promotional or laser lights.  I didn&#39;t post this message until today when I heard about numerous similar sightings that night and mention of this web sight on WBBM Radio (780 AM).  I am a trial attorney living in Tinley Park and I was blown away by the sight of theses thing.  I am a former skydiver and know for a fact that these things were not planes or helicopters.  They could move a fairly long distance very quickly and then just stop and hover.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Was not moving with the water -- straight line, very fast.  Moved south, disappeared, then reappeared a couple of minutes later moving north.

It was first stationary, then moved very slowly south, traveling what I would estimate as 3 degrees.  After the first half of that distance the form dimmed to about half brightness, then suddenly disappeared.  We also saw one more identical object behaving simmilarly within the next 20 min.  It was moving very slowly, and did not appear to be dimming continuously as you would expect a meteorite to do, but more like a dimming of head lights.  It moved, stopped, moved in a straight line again, paralell to the horizon, and disappeared.<n>

My oldest daughter came out to see what had now gotten us all looking up and as she turned to look around, out of the corner of my eye, i see something streak acrossed the sky heading north , as I watched it another was passing it coming south and I ran for my camera (digital powershotA300) I stepped back onto the deck and notice that 2 of the stars that had formed the circle were now missing, my husband told me it was coming back , as i turned to see it, the second one zipped so fast past it was  a split second. I turned back to the formation and noticed that the 2 emty spots were no longer emty. I took my camera and focused on the middle of  the formation and snapped a few pictures, as i did so, the middle object seemed to lower its self,  the entire formations seemed to shift  from east to west   and stood still again a bit closer. I took a few more shots and all stayed to watch but myself and daughter, we loaded the shots onto the computer and i sketched the formation on my paint program, as i pulled up my photos  I could see only one clear view of what was there and it in no way looked like a normal aircraft or a star, it was boomarang shaped with a row of lights around the outer shape. At one point while looking at the formation, there was a bright flash of red that seemed to go to one of the smaller crafts in the circle.  At 4:30 am all came in to see the picture and to agree on sketch, we all went out to look again and it was completly gone!! we were in the house for only about 60 seconds and all went back to look and found nothing! myself and my son ((name deleted)) kept hearing a high pitched  tone in our ears which kept me up till dawn. Since that night we have all looked to see if we could be wrong, that it may have really been stars and the formation has never been seen since!I should mention that it was mostly clear skys with only a few high shreads of clouds. the sky seemed particularlly filled with stars, since we are in the city, its rare to see it such. This is not our first siting ,but is the only one that left a photo to prove it!

There were three red lights in a linear, equadistant formation and not moving.  After a short time they began to move from southwest to northeast, remaining in formation.  After a short distance, they stopped and the began to form a triangle formation with the lead light staying put and the other two lights moving north and south to form a triangle.  After about ten minutes without movement, the two lights moved back into a linear formation behind the lead light.  Five minutes later, the lead light started to move and disappeared.  Then the second light started to move and disappeared.  And finally the third light.  We heard no noise.  Being so close to Midway and O&#39;hare airports we see and hear planes often.  During this event we noticed we couldn&#39;t find lights from a plane anywhere.  We thought that was odd.  The lights seemed to be hovering over Chicago, estimating angle and distance.  Also Chicago had an air and water show that day.  But the lights didn&#39;t look like anything I&#39;ve seen before and I spent six years in the military.  The precision of movement and peculiar dissapearance were very strange.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.  PD))<n>

No less than 14 videos have been reviewed in great detail in addition to numerous photos.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As one can imagine, this has resulted in a tremendous volume of information, and the number of witnesses is still growing.  New footage is also being recieved.  In addition,there is a chance that some of these events may be contaminated with some hoaxes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Therefore, we can only conclude the following for the moment:<n> <n><n> <n><n> Genuine unusual craft (UFO) have been seen and recorded in the Tinley Park area and others on one or more of the above dates.

On August 20, 2004 from 10:25 to 10:27 pm we witnessed a triangular shaped object moving across the sky from a north to south direction.  The event only lasted maybe 3 minutes.  It was right over our heads. Not very high at all.  The length of the object may have been large enough to allow three large commercial airplanes in it. At first glance it looked as though it was three lights traveling simultaneously across the sky.  However, I looked at this object through Tasco mini binoculars.  I then was surprised to see this was one large object with three lights located on each corner. I need to add that I saw this object tilt toward the west and then level off.  Now I have grown up in Elk Grove Village with a commercial flight path over the top of my parents’ home since I was two years old.  I have seen probably every type of plane and size.  This was something that I have never seen before.  My wife agrees that this was the strangest object we have ever seen.  What is most interesting is this object only stayed in sight for maybe three minutes.  It completely vanished right in front of us.  I don&#39;t know if it went up or we just lost it in the cloud haze.  The night was partial cloudy and then clear allowing visibility to the night stars for a while. Then a haze would roll through for short time and obstruct a clear view of the night sky. This is why I say we don&#39;t know if we just lost it in the cloudy haze rolling through.  My wife says the object did not fade into a cloudy haze.  I was busy trying to setup a telescope to look at this object closer.  I never got the chance.  We have no idea what this was, if someone does let us know.  That is all the information I have to give.  I wish I had some night vision video or camera that I could have taken a picture of this thing with but I don&#39;t.  I won&#39;t forget what I just saw!!<n>
8/20/04 22:15|Adriatic Sea (near Hvar) (Croatia)||Formation|5-7 minutes|Triangle of lights moving in a straight line across the Agean Sea almost west-to-east.|10/27/04|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/039/S39600.html|217|ndxe200408| Triangle of lights moving in a straight line across the Agean Sea almost west-to-east.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were aboard the Royal Clipper sailing from Losinj to Hvar on Friday, 20 August 2004 at 22:15 CEST (GMT+1) 44d06m09s N 14d44m06s E, looking at the beautiful starfield afforded by the view just behind the bridge. Maritime regulations require the front of a ship to be dark, so the view of the sky was quite good. We&#39;re suburbanites, and we don&#39;t get a good view of the sky including the Milky Way all that often. The only real issue was the haze: it had been a hot, muggy day, and the haze limited viewing to about 45 degrees from zenith.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were counting meteors (and a good count, too: stragglers from the Perseids?) when my eyes caught two lights almost directly overhead. The two lights were on the same line of flight but offset from one another. I&#39;m not good at magnitudes, but the lights were not that much brighter than most of the stars in the sky. What was obvious was that they were white and steady (did not twinkle like stars or blink/flash like aircraft navigation lights) and they were definitely headed in the same direction and staying the same distance apart. The two lights were about as far apart as 2 quarters held at arms length. They moved across the span of my fist at arms length in about two seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I figured this was a pair of fighters in formation except for the complete lack of jet noise. Then I saw the third light moving alongside the trailing light making an isosceles triangle about as long as it was wide moving in the direction of the narrow vertex. Again, the three objects maintained their spacing the whole of the time we watched.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The ship was on a heading of 148.2 degrees magnetic (based upon the magnetic compass under my right elbow), and the object appeared to be headed toward about 110 degrees on the horizon. We lost the object in the haze at about 45 degrees from zenith.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My darling wife saw the object as well. (Amazing I could get her attention given I had laryngitis and couldn&#39;t speak above a whisper.) She says that she saw the stars between the three lights blink out as they went by, but I&#39;m not so sure about that. The eyes can play tricks, and I&#39;m not certain that that &#34;blink out&#34; wasn&#39;t just the effect of ones eyes dealing with moving objects against a non-moving field.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Of course we were alone on the foredeck during our sighting. Several people joined us just as we lost the object in the haze. Darling wife dived into the bridge to get our location and heading.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My sense was that these three lights were very high up and resembled the Space Station or satellites I&#39;ve seen in that they were moving in a steady straight line. My first notion was that this was the NOSS satellite constellation. However, that system would be in a polar orbit. These objects were moving almost west-to-east ending up on the horizon at about 110 magnetic. I&#39;ve been searching my resources for another three-satellite system that goes west-to-east, but I&#39;m not finding one. So here we are...<n> <n><n> <n><n> Info on the ship were were on: http://www.starclippers.com<n>

They were in exact relationship (unmoving except in direction of travel)to each other. I first saw them at bout 70 degrees up to the south through binoculars while watching satellites and observed them travel to the horizon. I saw them again on Friday night but a bit earlier with their meeting the horizon at 10:16 PM on the same trajectory. I suspect they are satelies of some kind of experiment but could not find any help on the web.

I had just finished renting couple of movies from Blockbuster Video. As I drove on Archer Ave. I saw a plane which I thought it was, but the flickering lights was what changed my mind that this was no plane, helicopter or any man object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I approached home, this object kept going in circles (counter clock-wise). I parked my car and kept looking at it. It made no sound. At this time I was in front of my home. So I called my dad to come look at this. he was laying down on the bed watching the news. When I told him to bring the video camera, he jumped and knew I wasn&#39;t kidding. As my father was getting the video camera, I kept watching this object making its counter clock-wise circles when suddenly it cut through the circle. It was like drawing a circle and half way through the circle making a straight line to where you starting at. It was weird.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When my dad came out, he said, &#34;it&#39;s a helicopter&#34;. I insisted that it wasn&#39;t when suddenly 3 fire balls fell from this object. One after the other. They looked like small comets burning down from the sky. Now the object shot north bound then toward us in great speed heading to the Orland Park/Tinley Park vincinity.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I called 911, to report this, but they didn&#39;t care. So here is my story. What it was, I believe it wasn&#39;t from this world that&#39;s for sure!  R.Enriquez<n>

I asked her if she thought it was a blimp she said she&#39;d  never seen a blimp with lights around it. We stood watching this lit up disc shaped object move from East to West it as it changed color sometimes surrounded by a red hazy glow and three bright metalic red lights.  There was a circular shaft of light in the center of  it . It moved at random speeds, more slowly when it was traveling side to side where it went behind  trees and seemed to hide for a moment  then reapear. The speed picked up when it moved  towards and away from us. I could see the bottom of the disk when it traveled North (towards us) it had a circle of blue and green lights around it. When it moved away it changed shape completely it looked more oblong with a fish like tail. The first time it changed shape I was sure it was going to vanish it got considerably smaller and seemed to travel far away at a high speed then came back to its original shape and spot in a clearing between trees.. Two hellicopters appeared after we had been watching it for about 10 minutes one swooped down close to it  from above and vanished out of sight another hellicopter was shining a searchlight below and to the east of the object  it was about five or ten minutes before that one left as well.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We had to meet someone for dinner and left after watching it for about 25 minutes. It was hard to take my eyes off but I was also having doubts and questions about what I was seeing and trying to turn it into something  explainable- maybe some new military plane.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

After about 5-10 minutes the sound returned and there was a red cylinder shaped object in the north.  Suddenly, the cylinder became a very bright light like a search light had been turned on.  This was answered by another brigh light in the south and another in the west.  These lights stayed on for 10-20 seconds in a stationary position and then suddenly all three became red balls moving very quickly and disappearing to the west.  After another 10-15 minutes the same red cylinder was observed very high in the sky moving from west to east and the white light appeared three more times but at a very high elevation.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We received a telephoned report from this individual, and he seemed quite credible to us.

It was very dark at night, and we were very clearly able to see the stars in the sky. While watching, we saw what appeared to be 3 stars moving in a straight line across the sky. Whatever the stars were, they appeared to be very, very high in the sky. Looking up, they appeared to be less than an inch from each other, but as high as they were, they could have been a couple of miles apart. I&#39;ve seen one star move before, assuming it to be a satellite or jet plane. This is the first time I&#39;ve ever seen 3 move together in what appeared to be formation. There was a single star out front and 2 other stars behind it side by side, in a triangle formation. The stars continues across the sky and we watched until we lost sight. They were travelling from southwest to northeast (into Canada)<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We wonder whether the witness means a duration of 30 seconds, not 30 minutes.

The 3 crafts zoomed all around the sky like nothing I&#39;ve ever seen.  I have been somewhat of a skeptic until that evening. What I saw was absolutely amazing and I could not take my eyes off the crafts.  I continued to watch the entire duration of their presence which was approx. 3 hours.  They seemed to be boomerang shaped or triangular. There are no aircrafts on this planet that could move like that that I&#39;m aware of. After they &#34;cruised&#34; around for a while, they all 3 took off high up into the heavens headed west and up, up, up until they were no longer visible.

They were traveling approximately 40 mph and were traveling southeast.  They appeared to be playing a game like ring around the roseo.  They would come together in the center, touch, and then go back out again.  They continued to travel separately, in a circle and then come together and touch, and then go back out.  They did this approximately 10, maybe a dozen times.  I followed them for as long as I could, about a mile or so until the end of the road.  It is pretty deserted out there, only a few houses.  They continued and I loss sight of them.  There was a car at the end of the road before me on a cell phone, and another car that stopped that was behind me.

But everyone can here those planes over a 2 mile radius even while on the express way. I heard nothing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object was cylindrical shaped with lights on the side.  But it was just sitting in one place not moving.  At the distance, I can tell if it was a helicopter or plane, something identifiable.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then all of a sudden, three balls of white light drop out of it like flares coming out of a plane.. Now I have seen flares dropped out of a plane before.  These were bright white balls of light that were mechanically controlled.  They were not fireworks from either Navy Pier, Soldier Field, or Sox 35th Stadium.  These lights left no trail of smoke and a lot larger than a firework spark or white flare. The first one dropped and I thought it would just keep falling and then it did these outrageous 90 degree turns. Then the same thing for the other two.  The way the were moving so fast I could barely keep up with my own eyes. Plus, they looked as if they were doing a Light show.  My eyes could barely keep up with the speeds and turns of just one of them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Maybe I&#39;m being too eager with this one, because of my original sighting in July.

Then I realized that the lights of the &#34;plane&#34; ,which were all orange, began to move independantly. What i mean by this is that they were changing formation in a very unusual manner. They were declerating then accelerating moving side to side and generally jaggering around. The thought of it being fire flies came to mind accept that what i saw was above a thin layer of clouds. I thought the possability of it being military air craft except that the G-Force from such violent manueverse would kill the pilot. The speed of these aircraft would seem to be extreme in relativity to my perception of the altitude of the craft.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The fog was so thick that we could hardly see. Then one of us saw a bright yellow light far out on the water moving south at quite a rapid pace. It was not bobbing in the waves (which were sizeable) as a boat would have, and it was too bright and moving too fast to be a large boat farther out. It was right on the water, not above the horizon. We observed it until it faded into the fog, then as we were leaving we saw it again moving north at the same speed.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
8/20/04 20:00|Des Moines|IA|Triangle|10m|Triangle sighted on I-35 in Des Moines|9/1/04|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/038/S38931.html|232|ndxe200408| Triangle sighted on I-35 in Des Moines<n> <n><n> <n><n> My wife and I were traveling south on I-35 from Ankeny to Des Moines, which is approx. a 12 mile drive.  As we got onto the interstate I noticed a brightly lit object in the sky about halfway between Ankeny and DSM.  I initially thought it was an aircraft approaching the Ankeny Regional Airport, but as I kept driving the object didn&#39;t seem to be getting closer.  From my early vantage point the object looked to be at a height of around 1500 ft.. The craft was still in plain view when I passed the mixmaster area which is 6 miles from DSM, but considerably lower(1000ft.?).  I now was thinking this might be some sort of tower, but I had never seen anything like this and being from that area I&#39;m sure I would have noticed it before.  I&#39;m also sure that I wouldn&#39;t have been able to see it at the altitude that it was at now when I first saw it in Ankeny.  When I finally passed it I could finally rule out a tower.  I slowed down to 50mph and rolled down the window to look at it.  It was right off the interstate and I was able to look directly up at it.  It was only 250 ft up with 3 bright lights in the shape of a triangle with a moving, smooth red light that moved back and forth in a fluid motion.  My wife who is an absolute skeptic on things like this pointed out 3 cars on the far side of the road that seemed to be not working.  I turned around on Guthrie Ave.(DSM), which is about a mile from where I saw the object, to go back and get some footage with my Digicam.  I could tell it was gone though and could now determine that it wasn&#39;t a tower because they just don&#39;t get up and walk away.  I am a former Marine and I know what helicopters look like at night.  This was something I&#39;d never seen before.  On a side note, I called a friend of mine after I got home to tell him about my sighting.  He was at the Iowa State Fair which is approx 5 miles from where I saw the craft.  I told him to watch the skies.  The next day, he said the only thing he saw that night was a news helicopter get escorted from the area by 2 huey choppers.  I thought that was interesting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Best, ((name deleted))<n>

It was going really fast and I glanced up at it as it passed behind me in the car and I tried to see if it had wings and couldn&#39;t tell if it did or not.  I drove up a short distance on the road and turned in a east direction on another road and seen the aircraft again.  It was going away from me flying in a straight line and thats when I seen what leads me to believe it was UFO.  It had two sets of what looked like three windows on the back with a flashing redlight located where a planes tailfin would be located.  I lost it below the horizon after it got past the treeline and when I turned on another road and headed north, I looked east and could not see this object.  After I had thought about it, I realized that this object did not make a sound.  My friend convinced me to report this sighting on your site.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was just hanging there, about 30 deg up on the horizon. The brim was jet black in color and the crown was a cream color.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I watched it for about 30 sec and I looked away for and instant and it was gone. There was not a single cloud in the sky on this day. I searched the sky but it was no where to be seen. There was just blue sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In August the same year I was practicing golf again at around the same time, 3.00 pm when I was attracted by a flash in the cloudless blue sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first I couldn’t see anything, but then I saw a group of objects that I at first mistook for birds. They looked about the size of a dinner plate but as they descended and grew larger I could see that they were in fact discs.  They were dull white in color and rising and falling as if they were riding a wave and going very slowly. They looked to be approximately 5 to 6 feet across. Estimating their true size was difficult as I had no idea how high they were.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I counted 9 of them, and as they leveled out in a very ragged two abreast formation, one then turned and went away to the south west, but when it reached a certain point it just pure and simply dissolved into nothing. I was absolutely amazed at what I was seeing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I then turned my attention back to the others and focused on the next leading disc and it dissolved in the same manner.  At first it began to go black at the front then turned into deep olive green and as it was turning at the same time I could just make out a bulge at the top before it dissolved into a cloud of black dots.   Like pixels on a computer.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was no flashing lights or any kind of noise. And all the while their speed never varied, each one of them disappeared at the same point in the cloudless blue sky as silent as they came.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The whole episode lasted for about two minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I found this site by accident and decided to tell someone about what I saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was very skeptical about the whole UFO scene, but not now.<n>

There was a breaking news story on the 4:30 report, there had been an accident on I41 just outside of Oshkosh and they had live footage from a helicopter. I happened to look at the clock it was 4:58 then turned 4:59, I was watching the footage and noticed 7 silver/white on the top, and dark on the bottom, saucer/oval shaped objects fly in a v formation accross the bottom of the screen, I have Tevo so I pressed record, because what I saw shocked me.  I told my husband whom I was on the phone with at that time what I had seen, and he just laughed a little.  Later that evening when we viewed the recording we were totally amazed and a little freaked out.  These objects were absoutly NOT birds or anything else like that.  We watched it for almost 45 minuted, rewinding it, in slow-motion, freeze frame, frame by frame, we tried to analize it but still could not begin to explain it. They flew in a v formation and at one point it almost looks as if one of them get too close to another and sort of &#34;bounces&#34; off of the other, and at times you can see the formation &#34;adjusting&#34;.  You can plainly see that they are in between the helicopter and traffic that was backed up from the accident on the ground.  You can also tell that they are traveling over at least 75 mph, because they are going faster that the traffic on the highway below.  I have the footage but I am not sure how to record it so I can email it.  I suppose I could get a DVR and hook it up to our TV then record it that way.  I actually, video taped (with our video camera)the TV so I could show my parents what we saw.  I also contacted WTMJ4 via email but have yet to hear back.  I suppose you could get file tape from that day???  Anyway, we are totally amazed and confused, and think you will be too.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with this witness, and she sounded sober-minded to us.  We have requested still images from the tape.  We do not know what appeared on the screen of the television.  PD))<n>

Our location is in the middle of the Pacific Ocean between the Philippines and Japan. If you will observe real close on the 9 o&#39;clock position of the orange cube you will notice a white object shaped like an inverted space shuttle or a cross like appearance just above the blue waters.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What makes this picture very legitimate and makes this object really interesting, is that this evolution that we are about to do is weapons testing and target shooting using all the armaments of the ship. There is no way on earth that any kind of sea vessel will be any near our ship. We are thousands of miles away from the nearest land and theres no way a target shooting will commence if theres any ship near us or worse be visible to the naked eye.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I just discovered this object after developing it but was not there during the actual shot. It cannot be cloud because it is too white and too define and it is so near the surface of the water.

It had to be one unit as the lights stayed in the same formation as it moved from South to North, then, North to South across the night sky.

At 23:55 pm, I noticed a white light that I assumed was an airplane climbing at a steep 45 angle as an airplane would in an agressive take off. The craft then changed direction at a 90 degree angle and then dove toward the ground at a 45 degree angle, stopping 5 feet from the ground and hovering with the craft tilted to the north. The craft was about 200 feet away across the north bound lanes of highway 5. I did not see anything else because I was driving. The craft was shaped like a Stingray with 3 white lights on the top of it. I first noticed the craft because it was not flying like a normal aircraft because of the sharp take off angle (I did not notice it taking off from the ground)and then the sharp turns, diving toward the ground and the hover.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My wife first saw the light of the craft and the saw it making a 90 degree turn and then dive toward the ground and since she was not driving noticed the stingray shape. She noticed the 3 white lights that if we used the stingray shape was two of the lights at the outside as the flippers and one light at the front where the nose would be. My wife heard noises similar to a jet engine making different noises like a acceleration and deceleration noises, I did not hear them. The craft looked to be about the size of a normal passenger car.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The area that we had the sighting was not populated as most of highway 5 is between Bakersfield and Stockton. The craft would have been sighted by cars in the north bound lanes, with a better view of the hover.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My initial thought was that it was a remote controled toy, but then I thought it was a crop duster, but both would not be operated near midnight. The whole thing did not look real to me, so I was not scared and did not think to pull over.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

This craft made no noise and blotted out stars as it went. It was a long triangle and looked strange.It just glided and went slow until out of sight. It kept the same speed and was going west to east. We saw it for about a full minute....<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Objects were solid white approximatly the size of a small to medium star.  Objects maintained perfect formation but moved in jerky motion in unison. Stars could be seen between the objects maintaining that these were three separate craft.  Lead craft was the point of the triangle (opposite of triangular formation seen in New Jersey) . No noise (very quiet night!) One witness claims a beam was seen passing between the objects occasionally. Size and brightness was about that of the middle three stars of Cassiopia.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We suspect the objects were the three satellites that have been reported during August 2004.

On the night of 8-19-04 while we were setting up our scopes and checking on the sky condition we noticed what appeard to be two satelites slowly moving together so we grabbed our binoculars to take a closer look. In the binoculars we could see a third light in the formation. The lights moved in a tight isosceles triangle formation about two degrees across with the sharpest angle at the front. Stars could be seen unaffected inside the formation. There was no sound. The lights moved across the sky in a northwest to southeast direction and maintained their exact positions in the formation. After traveling about 45 degrees across the sky the lead light disappeared followed by the other two lights that disappeared together exactly at the same line in space where the first light disappeared.  This is the second time we have observed this  type of phenomenon by Mt. Rainier. The first time occurred August 12,2001 3:20am. That sighting was similar to this one except that there were two lights moving in a south to north direction with the third member of the formation catching up to the first two lights it than slowed down and moved over towards the second of the two lights and then all three lights moved northward together maintaining their exact positions to each other. The formation continued to traveled northward for about 5 min. until we could&#39;nt see it anymore with our binoculars.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We suspect the objects may have been the satellites thought by us to be part of the  U.S.Navy &#34;NOSS&#34; satellite system.

They were too high in altitude to be a boat or oil rig.  They did not flicker or move, so they could not be a flare.  There were four or so orange dots with the center two closer together.  They appeared suddenly and disappeared instantly thirty seconds or so later.  They never appeared to move at all.  They were just a solid orange color.  I called the local news agencies the next day to report my sighting.  They said that The Blue Angels were based close by in Pensacola, Fla. and could have been practicing out over the Gulf Of Mexico.  If this was the case, wouldn&#39;t the lights have changed position?  Wouldn&#39;t the intensity of the light change?

8/19/04 22:10|York|PA|Unknown|5 seconds|orange sphere traveled by at  a high speed and disappeared.|8/24/04|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/038/S38770.html|249|ndxe200408| orange sphere traveled by at  a high speed and disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At approximately 2210 on 19 August 2004, I was in the company of a co-worker and seated on a patio in the area of East York, Pennsylvania.  The atmosphere harbored a considerable amount of light pollution, but an object appeared very noticeably.  An orange sphere appeared to be traveling from west to south-east, and traveled in a steady, fast pace, and was totally silent. This object was traveling faster than an aircraft, but far slower than a meteor.  I would estimate that the object was below the clouds, due to the distinct view and minimal dissipation of light to the surrounding atmosphere. The object was visible for approximately five seconds, and abruptly disappeared.  It was peculiar that the sphere disappeared instead of “burning out”.  Immediately after the object was visible, a helicopter traveled over our location in the exact trajectory that the orange sphere was bearing.  I can not determine if the helicopter was commercial or military, only that is was quite loud like the military variety.  At the same time, there were two aircraft traveling in different directions directly overhead.  These aircraft were at a high altitude. From 2210 until 2310 there were 18 distinct aircraft traveling in an eastern to western direction.  This seemed like an extremely high number of aircraft to be located in a particular vicinity, especially in the time period of 2210-2310.  These aircraft appeared to be non-commercial, due to the close proximity and flying pattern.  The formation was triangular and staggered. I had the impression that the aircraft were military. There was a great variety of beacon lights on these aircraft; some displayed an extremely large wingspan, giving the impression of a bomber style or “AWACS” (radar) style aircraft.  My co worker and I traveled to a location approximately three miles away, where there was less light pollution and elevated so that our view was not impaired. From 2330-0200, there were absolutely no aircraft visible.  The saturation of aircraft in the timeframe of the sighting of the orange sphere causes a profound suspicion in the witness, and is lead to draw no other conclusion that the a governmental entity was in pursuit of the same object  that I observed.  This individual contacted the York Airport in Thomasville, and received no information or further direction.  This individual also contacted Harrisburg International Airport, spoke with an individual in Operations, who then contacted his supervisor who was an FAA employee.  His response was that “Obviously the Federal authorities knew of the occurrence, but you should feel free to contact your local authorities to inform them of the situation.

I was driving westbound on M-14, an expressway in Southeastern Michigan. I have driven this expressway for the last 20 years (I am a serial commuter) and I know it like the back of my hand. It was dark out and as I rounded a corner I noticed a large, bright object just over the trees up ahead of me. As I got closer, I noticed that the light came from three large circles with a flashing orange circle in the middle. They were in a triangular pattern. The light was an extremely white, very intense light. I was the only car on the westbound side of the expressway so I slowed way down to around 10-15 mph, almost to a stop.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object was about 200 feet in the air, just past the Gotfredson Road exit (going westbound), on the south side and about 50 yards off the expressway. At first I couldn’t see the structure that the circles of light were attached to but as I got closer and was more directly under it, I noticed that the lights were attached to a triangular shaped object. The only way I saw the structure was because it was slightly darker than the night sky. It had some depth but probably wasn’t more than 30 feet deep. I thought it was odd that the lights did not throw any reflection up to the structure. The lights had no reflective properties at all. Even the ground below was not lit up by any light. With as bright as these lights were and how close it was to the ground, I couldn’t understand why nothing was lit up.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This thing was large. It was the size of a 747 or so, if a 747 could be triangular. The ends of the triangle were blunted, they were not sharp. The object made no noise. This particular section of the expressway has no development and is surrounded by crop fields and stands of woods. There is no lighting or large buildings. When I slowed down to a crawl, I noticed that this thing was staying stock-still and was making no noise. None. I watched the object for about two more minutes. It never moved. The only motion was the orange light blinking in the middle of the three white lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
8/19/04 22:00|Mule Creek Canyon (on the  Rogue River)|OR|Fireball|10 seconds|Three very large lights at different times in the sky above the tree line.  Military jets flying in the area.|8/24/04|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/038/S38802.html|252|ndxe200408| Three very large lights at different times in the sky above the tree line.  Military jets flying in the area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were on a rafting trip and camped near Mule Creek Canyon at a place called the Rogue River Ranch.  There are no lights anywhere nearby so I was looking at stars with my binoculars.  We could hear military jets in the area as the echo was loud off the canyon walls.  I got back in my tent and was laying there looking out when I saw a large light in the sky above the tree line.  I could hear other campers say &#34;Did you see that?&#34;, so I jumped out of my tent with my binoculars.  The light was gone.  It had only lasted a few seconds.  But about a minute later a large round orange light came on suddenly just above the trees. It was the size of a nickel held at arm&#39;s length.  I looked at it through my binoculars and it was just a very bright light.  I couldn&#39;t make out any structure.  It disappeared after about 10 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I could still hear a jet in the distance and followed the jet with my binoculars.  It was far away and many miles to the right of the light. All I could see was the red light on it&#39;s left wing as it made a huge sweeping turn to the left.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The next morning people were talking about the lights and someone said he had seen three different lights within about ten minutes.  He thought it was the afterburner from the jets.  I don&#39;t know what afterburner would look like but for it to have been that big in the sky I would think the jet would have to be visible nearby with the binoculars.  The jet I saw was in a different part of the sky and very far away.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was strobe like and did not appear to be a planes normal light. It flashed and appeared to move left to right rapidly, but we were both consintrating so hard on it that it may have been are eyes that caused this effect. Also after a minute are two a &#34;normal&#34; aircraft appeared and seemed to be shadowing this craft. A short time after the &#34;normal&#34; aircraft appeared the strobe like craft left over the horizen.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I saw a little, faint, white light appear near a skyscraper that was across the street. It made no noise, was too high to be a helicopter, and moved unlike a plane should. Instead of a straight line, it zigzagged around in a way that reminded me of a bug, then it disappeared after a few seconds. A minute or two later, I saw three more appear and I watched them zip around in all different directions, then disappear. I asked someone nearby if he could see strange lights in the sky, so we watched for a few minutes, then I spotted another one. He saw it, too, and neither of us could think of what the lights were. We saw a few more before the trolley we were waiting for came.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The lights would slowly fade, and eventualy vanish.  after a minute or two they would reappear in around the same spot.  After watching those two lights for about 20 minutes We witnessed another bright orange light to the south of the original lights and about 10 degrees higher that the originals. That light shown for approximatly 2 seconds then as theat one went out about two fingrs widths apart from where we were standing another light appeared for the same amount o time when another light appeared the same distance as the last.  We saw six lights in all.  The formation made a perfect line.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

As soon as I got onto I-35s in Ankeny I could see 2 bright lights in the sky and a decent altitude.  I thought it was an aircraft approaching the Ankeny airport which is a small facility that handles small planes.  The object didn&#39;t move though as I kept traveling and it seemed to get lower the closer I got to it.  When I was about a mile from the object I could finally make out a good description.  3 white lights formed in a triangle with a strange red light in the middle.  As I passed it I looked up and could see the smooth red light moving back and forth.  I turned around on the next exit and went back, but it was gone.  I&#39;ve never seen a tower in that area that looked like that and I&#39;ve never seen a plane with that red light. My wife also noticed 3 cars stopped along the side of the road apparently not working. When I got back home I called my friend who was at the Iowa State Fair to tell hime to watch the skies.  The reason being is that my &#34;sighting&#34; was very near the fairgrounds(3 miles).  He told me the next day that the only thing he saw was the news helicopter that was filming overhead get escorted away by 2 military type helicopters.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
8/19/04 20:00|Gary/Hammond|IN|Triangle|45-60 seconds|Three triangular glowing lights flying very slowly toward the horizon (I-90 West outside Gary, Indiana)|9/9/04|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/039/S39198.html|258|ndxe200408| Three triangular glowing lights flying very slowly toward the horizon (I-90 West outside Gary, Indiana)<n> <n><n> <n><n> Traveling West on I-90 toward Chicago, somewhere between Gary and Hammond, I saw three isoceles triangle shaped, glowing lights that had a bright, pinkish-white hue and a lighted trail. What caught my eye was their shape, large size relative to their location in the sky, and slow movement toward the horizon. It was completely unlike the typical lights from aircraft flying at night; there was no blinking or flickering, and the size and shape indicated three separate movements. The lights appeared to be moving in formation. My friend and I watched and were very aware that what we were looking at was extremely unusual. We even thought about watching the news that night to see if any unusual sightings were reported. The three lights slowly dimmed and disappeared. I searched the sky for about ten minutes afterward and saw no sign of them. When we got into Chicago, we learned that the air show was taking place that weekend, which we figured might have been the cause (although we both maintained this did not resemble airplane flight).<n> <n><n> <n><n> When we first saw the lights my friend was talking on her cell phone with perfect reception. Suddenly the connection completely failed. After the lights were gone she redialed and had a perfect connection once again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had not forgotten the event and when I came across this website and saw the large number of reports in and around the Chicago area for that weekend, I felt our experience was validated.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  The sightings occurred in Chicago on August 21st, not August 19.  We will correspond with the witness to inquire whether the date indicated above is correct.  PD))<n>

I am an amateur astronomer and I knew that there weren&#39;t any stars over there, at that time. I ran an got my telescope and when I focused on it at 125x, I could see a transparent teardrop/sphere object just sitting. It never moved at all for the duration, but after the sun had gone far enough below the horizon, it faded to an orangeish yellow, then finally disappeared for good. I had called my friend just a mile away and in his telescope he could see the exact same thing. His whole family could see it as well. While we were observing it, the streetlights went out for just a second. Also, while I was on the phone, we could hear a pulsating (sp?) buzzing noise in the background that lasted about 10 seconds. It is a 2.4 GHz cordless telephone. We knew that after we had seen the object fade with the sun setting that it had to be in the vicinity of the Earth, perhaps the upper atmosphere, and not a supernova, comet, asteroid, meteor, etc.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Zaleski says that probably would rule out a satellite.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Patrick Hogan at the Metropolitan Airports Commission says folks in the tower at Minneapolis-St. Paul International Airport thought it might be a weather balloon.

It seemed to be conducting its own light, which after dark charges to yellow then red. The sun had been down for awhile when this happened so I do not think it was reflection from the sun. In my binoculars it appered as if the object may have been exibiting rotation, but it was diffuclt to observe any details. The object would move slowly, then stop suddenly and hover. I don&#39;t think the winds aloft would make a ballon behave this way. In order for all these people to see this object which was tens of thousands of feet in altitude this object must have been very large. Just in terms of what a 747 looks like flying above cirris clouds I would say this object was 4 times larger.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The earliest reports I heard were 9am in the morning and it was there until dark.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I personally did not hear about it until around 6pm in the evening when a small blurb was mentioned on the radio.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object drifted slowly but not very far while under my observations and exhibited no unusual characteristics that one would expect if this were a high-altitude research balloon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The meteorologists from the local TV stations said that it was above the cirrus clouds indicating an altitude greater than 30,000.  This would make the object VERY big indeed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A local person with a high-powered telescope viewing it said it did indeed look like a balloon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Perhaps that would satisfy most people&#39;s questions, but how does an untethered balloon stay in basically the same position for at LEAST 12 hours in a row?  Especially in the Midwest where fronts are blowing through every few days?  Perhaps it was the center of a very slow moving low pressure system?  Officially, NO ONE has claimed ownership for the object and there has been NO official explaination.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Here are some links to various local TV stations that covered (briefly) the event:  http://wcco.com/localnews/local_story_232202348.html http://www.startribune.com/stories/462/4938203.html http://www.kstptv5.com/article/stories/s1972.html http://www.coasttocoastam.com/shows/2004/08/20.html#ufo http://www.visi.com/~rschwa/arspix/IMG_2068.JPG  Here is a photo that I took, although it was almost dark by the time I got home to get my camera.

I was listening to the program and was also emailing one of your guests, Will.  He suggested I provide a description of what I saw on August 19th, 2004.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I arrived home to Chaska, MN (about 5 miles from the Chanhassen Weather Center) from a business trip to Madison, WI.  the last 110 miles of the trip heads pretty much East to West heading into and through the Minneapolis area.  As I was unloading my vehicle my neighbor stopped by (he is retired military) and we chatted a little bit.  When I asked him what I had missed the last couple of days, he pointed in the sky directly above us and said, &#34;see that, it&#39;s been in the spot since 9:00 am this morning.  I looked up in the sky and saw a very bright object, very high in the sky.  I asked hime what it was, and he said nobody knows.  He said reports had been on TV and radio, but nobody knew what it was.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I ran in the house and grabbed my 10X binoculars and focused in on it.  It was very bright, light looking into a bright light and had a sloped rectangular shape (trapezoid?).  The brightness was unusual.  The light seemed to, well, move like when you look at an asphalt road and see the heat coming off the surface.  As I watched it, I noticed from the middle of the object to the bottom of it, was a grey V shape.  More like a rounded V, coming from the middle sides of the object and meeting at a point in the bottom of the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I ran back in the house and grabbed my video recorder.  It has a 150X digital zoom.  I tried to focus on the object, but couldn&#39;t keep it steady enough as I lay on my back in my yard.  I recorded it for about a minute, then reviewed what I had recorded.  All you could see was a bright light in the sky, it did not focus very well.  So I went back to watching it through the binoculars.  The object did move a little as I watched it.  If I held my hands above my head, at a distance of about 2 feet apart, that is the distance it moved by 7:30pm.  My military neighbor came back over to my house to let me know, that if it was something unknown, he was guaranteed that there would be military jets flying around.  I just kept watching.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Around 8:30, I asked another neighbor to look at the object through the binoculars and describe what he saw.  He saw it the same way as I did.  His wife looked at it and agreed.  Both were as curious as I was on what the object was.<n> <n><n> <n><n> By 9:00pm, the object had continued to move (another 2 feet measured by holding my hands above my head).  As my neighbor and his wife watched with me, the sun began to sink into the horizon.  As the sun goes down, it does turn a reddish orange.  As the sun turned that color, so did the object.  Leads me to believe the object was highly reflective, and reflecting light from the sun.  As the sun went down, the moon was rising from the SW.  The moon rose and the object stayed in the same location.  Once the sun was totally below the horizon, we could no longer see the object.  Even though there was still some sunlight left in the horizon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Through the whole time I watched the object, it moved, drifted in a North to South direction.  I wasn&#39;t looking straight up in the air, but the object was about 75 degrees above the horizon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I checked for reports the next day if there were sightings to the South, like Iowa or Nebraska, and nothing was reported.  BUT, I did see reports on August 20th that an object was noticed in the skies around Phoenix.  Some of the pictures that were submitted looked very similar to what I saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Again, submitting this based on the comments Mr Rense made from your show.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We have amended the time above to 1700 hrs.

It was white, round, and just stayed there at about 60,000 ft. and hovered in the same spot for about 4 hours.

What appeared to be right above us (between a 85-75 degree angle from where we were standing) was a white, sort of round object in the sky.  Ifigured it was a weather ballon or a star, but it was just an hour before the game started in broad day light.  We had brought binoculors and i look to see what it was, it was tremendously high, much higher than the plane that past by, so it was up there, then i thought it was a sattle light, but ive seen satlites in the sky, but only when it was really dark, this was large enough to see during the day.  A few other people saw it also, i let them look throught the binoculors also, they didnt know what it was.  But it just was in one spot for the longest time, then after a while, it was move, but very slowly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As i keeped looking into the binoculars, just wonerding what it was, it appeared to be round, it was hard to tell it it was moving in any way, but i noticed a dark spot in the middle, my uncle descibed it as a donut shaped object, and it was clearly shinny in the binoculars reflecting the suns light or something.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The last i saw of it was when we went into the dome, it moved from the place from where we first saw it to a good distance if you put your pointer finger sidways torwards the sky, it moved the length of your pointer finger (mine is around 3 inches).  It was amazing to see, then my unckle told me about this site and that other people witnessed it!!  So i hope my information was helpful.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I was puzzled and he explained that on WCCO they had reported a white floating thing that hadn&#39;t moved for hours.  We all went outside and watched it for a good for hours while we cooked up our food.  The neighbors in the next door yard had a pair of 7x35 binoculars they were using to look at the object and let us take a look.  I saw what appeared to be a pale white orb that was a bit stretched out on the top side.  Like a blunted teardrop, kind of.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object appeared to be stationary but during the course of our BBQ, it appeared to have moved from 12 o&#39;clock to about 10 o&#39;clock at a uniform height of 2.5 handspans (arms extended) above the horizon. A dime held at arms length completely obscured the object. I believe that even a popcorn kernel held at arm&#39;s length would have covered it.  3 of the 8 of us had about 3 beers apiece over the course of the 4 hours.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As to our credibility, we are all of sound mind.  I am a military veteran, one of the guys there is a Mennonite/Quaker type guy, one lady is a research biologist, and another works in a health diagnostic lab.  The remainder were college students. Everyone there was of a rational mindset.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In summary -- 8 of us saw something in the sky that we can&#39;t quite explain.  The idea of a balloon was (forgive the pun) floated but the object was far too stationary for that to be true.  Also, it should be noted that as the sun set, the object, suspended above the western horizon, remained consistently luminous -- a large white &#34;circloid&#34; with no noticable shading.<n> <n><n> <n><n> To be honest, we got bored with it after a while and ceased to pay attention to it.  Prior to this we noted it had been drifting relative to the trees.  Left to right, facing west.  When we wondered about it&#39;s position around 2100 hours, we weren&#39;t able to find it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We presume the date indicated above is correct, but a similar event occurred near the Twin Cities on August 19.  We will contact the witness for clarification.  Several news outlets reported the incident, and it remains unexplained, according to two of those media, as of September 8, 2004.  PD))<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((ADDENDUM FROM WITNESS))<n> <n><n> <n><n> Peter-<n> <n><n> <n><n> Yeah, it was Aug 19...the day everyone around here was seeing it.  Sorry about that, I don&#39;t usually keep track of the date.  It was all over the radio, TV...and then interest just disappeared.  Odd, you&#39;d think that folks would be interested in knowing what the heck was just floating stationary for such a long period of time.  Most folks just dismissed it with &#34;weather balloon&#34;.  It might have been but it certainly didn&#39;t exhibit balloon like properties, chiefly that whole &#34;not moving&#34; thing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Let me know if you learn any more about the flying object that has, to date, been unidentified.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Cheers!

I observed this through my 8 inch telescope at low and high power and can positivily identify it as some sort of large balloon.  It had a long tether hanging from it and was white and transparent.  This was definitly man-made. What is odd is that no official organazation seems to claim responsibility.  I would guess it got loose from somewhere in the western U.S.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I left work in downtown St Paul around 4:30 in the afternoon.  As I walked down the street I saw several people pointing up.  As this is an odd occurance in the middle of the city, I felt compelled to look up.  My experience is about the same as the others who reported.  It was a white or metallic reflective object, circle or somewhat teardroped in shape.  I don&#39;t believe it had lights of it&#39;s own, it just looked like reflected sunlight.  It did not appear to be moving and was very high.  It was quite small to the naked eye.  Others have mentioned, and I agree, a pea held at arms length would have covered the object.  Where and when I viewed it, it was very near overhead.  Perhaps a handswidth or two from directly overhead.  Reports of the object spanned the Twin Cities metro- sighting of this object was also reported on 8/19 and 8/20 in Wisconsin.  It was a rather obvious sight since the sky was crystal blue with no (few) clouds.  I did not spend more than a few minutes watching this object.  I did see reports on the news that said it had been around for hours.  I&#39;m very interested to get an explaination.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I dont know if this was a weather balloon or what but it stayed there for hours the last time i looked it was starting to get dark out and it was still there(there were no other stars yet) I took many pictures of this and can provide them to anyone who wants. it even made the local news for a while but they dont seem to be talking about it anymore. The object did seem to move very slowly in the sky over a period of many hours but i dont understand how any weather balloon could move so slowly and be visible for so long. I have no idea the altitude but i would imagine it was really high, probally 100,000 feet and the object must have been huge. There were some reports from aircraft at 35,000 that said it was still just a dot from up there. i observed it for periods of ten minutes at a time or so between going in my house and calling people to tell them to look etc. It did seem to change shape ever so slightly like it became elongated(such as what a weather ballon would do) it also appeared to emit small pulses of light off it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  One of several reports from the Twin Cities area.

I observed a very small silver sphere to the east northeast at approximately 80 degrees from the horizon. The object was moving very very slowly to the southwest. The sky was clear and visiblilty was excellent from south Minneapolis. The object reflected sunlight and was not luminous. Observation of the object under 150x magnification with a refracting astronomical telescope revealed it to be a very high altitude balloon of significant size.  It was seen to slowly deform and show tension lines which shifted as it returned to its original shape.  No instrument pakage was visible.  Consultations with meterologists at the University of Minnesota confirmed that every observation I made was consistent with the behavior of a very high altitude balloon (+50000 feet), where it would not be affected by lower altitude winds, explaining its anomalous behavior in seeming to move against the prevailing wind.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  One of many reports of the same object.

From my porch, I saw a triangle of 3 white/silver balls/cones in the sky between two tall pines.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My first reaction when I saw it was: &#34; What the hell is THAT&#34; !! The &#39;interior&#39; of the triangular object seemed to be almost invisible from my viewpoint.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I saw it at about a 45 degree angle, not directly up, therefore the 3 &#39;balls&#39; or &#39;cones&#39;were close together and it was difficult to judge thickness of the body.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The left and right ball/cone was toward me, the center one, the middle one, a bit more forward on the object. There were distinct lines on these balls/cones, perhaps like on booster rockets or similar to propulsion engines.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object could have been fairly close, not too far away, or it could have been higher in the sky from another viewpoint and then perhaps much larger.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Don&#39;t know how to draw the body shape at the angle I observed it at....<n> <n><n> <n><n> (Sending photo of the trees/sky where the object was seen.My drawing is not good, but this is how I saw it with the approximate color and size. Photo was taken after the sighting so I could draw the object in while fresh in my memory.) Hard to say if the left and right tips were rounded or not, my minds memory says they were rounded, nothing protruding out from over the balls/cones.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The &#39;object&#39; didn&#39;t change in its shape, just &#39;floated&#39; for close to 1 minute.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Suddenly it turned left (north) (behind the left pine tree in the photo) in a perfect triangular shape.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was perplexed. Got my camera and continued looking up at the sky from my porch.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About 20 min. later, a silent triangular object flew high in the sky at a much faster speed than an aircraft. No sound. It went right overhead, reflecting a light orange/amber hue through a thin mist or haze.....on what looked like a metallic body.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was not a cloud anywhere in the sky and many hours till the sun would set; the orange/amber hue must have come from the object itself.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I took 3 pictures, all had bright blue sky, no mist or clouds around.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object went over too fast to capture on my Sony digital camera.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Former airline employee, retired.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Company Address is 3300 Pacific Avenue. It&#39;s near Broadway and Washington in Minneapolis, roughly 3 Miles North out of Downtown Minneapolis. I went outside to the parking lot to have a cigarette. While outside I looked up and seen something that caught my eye. At first I thought it was a balloon that may have got away from the Minnesota State Fair as that was going on in St. Paul at the time. But as I watched it for a time, it was too shiny, and too large to be a balloon that one could hold onto and hope to remain on the ground. It was way up in the sky and very glimmery. It seemed almost stationary as I was out there for 5 minutes and it barely made it about 2 inches across the sky if you were to hold up your index finger and middle finger and look to the sky. Using that as a distance to measure, if possible. I just thought it weird and went back into work.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I noticed out the bedroom window a light not normally seen and kept watching it.  The light was yellowish almost like a street light.  It was coming from the n/nw at a very low altitude and a very slow rate of speed....gliding regally, would describe it. I watched as it came towards our rv; this vehicle had to have been black as it did not reveal its triangular shape clearly til it was nearer the rv I was in. The light was round, flat, and, as I saw,  set into the bottom of the vehicle.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This light was steady, never moving or changing...quite big and seemed to be in the center of the vehicle&#39;s bottom.  The odd thing about this light is that you would have thought it would light up the ground, but it didn&#39;t.  I opened the window to listen, but there was no noise.  The vehicle came on and as it approached our rv to go over it, I could actually see the bottom of the vehicle, that&#39;s how low it was.  The bottom had the round light pretty much in the middle and molding around it but the molding was shaped in triangle form.  Sort of like if you drew a star and then drew a circle in the middle...I saw no other lights.  It kept going at that same regal pace over our rv and on into the night in a s/southwesterly dirction as far as I know.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have a physical disability that prevents me from walking so I couldn&#39;t get to the other side of the room or go out to photograph this.

There was also a program early in Sept of this year on the History Channel showing a sighting in Belgium that had been reported at some time, and I thought it was similar to what I&#39;d seen.

8/19/04 01:20|Metchosin/Sooke Area (Canada)|BC|Light|20-minutes|Two Unidentified Nocturnal Aerial Lights in the Sooke Hills - Sooke Basin Area, Southern Vancouver Island, British Columbia, Canada|12/14/04|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/040/S40952.html|282|ndxe200408| Two Unidentified Nocturnal Aerial Lights in the Sooke Hills - Sooke Basin Area, Southern Vancouver Island, British Columbia, Canada<n> <n><n> <n><n> In the early hours of this warm Summer night I witnessed two bright lights, white in colour, stationary, or moving moderately about the western sky. They were in the vicinity of the Sooke Hills - Sooke Basin area (close to the Strait of Juan de Fuca). I was viewing them from Victoria, at least 16km- (10-miles) away. I have been interested in astronomy and aviation for most of my life and I am familiar with observing the night sky and aircraft at night. I can state with certainty that the lights were not astronomical bodies (they were not planets, stars, meteors, bollides, etc.) nor artificial satellites. The lights did not exceed a height of approximately 610-metre (2000-feet) above sea level. The flight characteristics (speeds and motions) of the two lights were not beyond those achievable by a conventional aircraft that is capable of stationary and/or very slow flight (to appear as if stationary), and forward flight at moderate speeds. A helicopter obviously comes to mind. However, my observations (I viewed the lights for 15-minutes over a 20-minute period) were not consistent with that of aircraft lighting: neither the red and green navigation lights, the red anti-collision beacon, nor the white anti-collision lights were visible at any time (I specifically looked for these lights). Additionally, the lights I did see were always visible and constant in brightness, never flickering, wavering, nor being lost from my view as they moved approximately 14° across my line of sight. They appeared to be omni-directional lights and not the uni-directional lights I associate with an aircraft&#39;s approach-lighting. The lights, seven minutes apart, descended from my view behind the hills. The first light to descend may have been associated with a condensation-like cloud trail (a natural patch of cloud is also a possibility). It lit this up from below when it was behind the ridge lines, out of my direct view. Despite having spent a considerable amount of my time viewing the sky (in one form or another related to my interests), this is the first time I have observed lights in the sky that I cannot identify nor confidently explain. They were certainly not astronomical in nature, and they were certainly local to the Sooke Hills area. My observations were inconsistent with my previous experiences of conventional aircraft activity; sufficiently anomalous to warrant my writing a detailed report about my sighting. However, I cannot, at this time, rule out aircraft activity with certainty.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My complete, detailed report with annotated maps has been published on the UFO*BC web site, http://www.ufobc.ca/History/2000/sookehills2004report.htm  I would be interested in reading reports of any other aerial activity (identified or not) that may relate to my sighting, whether around the date of my sighting or not.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was either glowing or flaming, and very bright. I was facing south, the object fell south-east, on the south side of Highway 2 over the mountains towards Eastern WA. It&#39;s hard to tell the size of it, but it was maybe 1000 square feet. I couldn&#39;t tell if it fell behind, in front, or on the mountains. There was no noise associated with it. It fell for about 3 or 4 seconds before it was out of site.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

A very clear night. We were looking at stars and talking about meteors and other things in the night sky. My 6 year old daughter asked if I had ever seen any UFOs. I said with all the sky watching I&#39;ve done over the years I never had. I do think they exist.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;m an aviation buff. I do a lot of amature astronomy &amp; sky watching. Meteor showers, Planets, Northern lights, Helicoptors, military aircraft. I&#39;ve seen some pretty spectacular meteors. Even one that hit the earth. I know aircraft &amp; stuff in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About 2 minutes after I said I&#39;d never seen a UFO my wife said &#34;is that one?&#34; I thought she was kidding. The kids got pretty excited. I looked up to the west. What I say sent a chill up my spine. 2 dark red oval or surf board shaped objects traveling side by side. They looked like two sets of eliptical wings like a WW 2 Spitfire but no fuselage. It looked like they had some kind of internal glow or lighting. A rust red or dark orange. I thought it looked like they had some kind of geometric pattern on the bottom that mimiced the eliptical shape of craft. Maybe a light or window. My 9 year old daughter thought on of them tilted a bit and she could see the top and it had some kind of structure like a box on the top.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They seemed to be in formation. Traveling very fast straight east. No sound at all. We get a of approaching air traffic for Mpls, St Paul Int airport. Pretty high up here. I know they were not any   They apeared to get get kind of close and then make a sharp 30 degree turn.No slow down what so ever. They made about 3 or 4 of these quick course changes and were headed straight north. With in 3 or 4 seconds they were compleatly gone. The whole event lasted maybe 10 or 12 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We all compared our notes and had seen the exact same thing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;ve seen a lot of stuff in the sky and knew what I was seeing but I&#39;ve never seen any thing like this. They manuvered like no aircraft I&#39;ver ever seen and were incredably fast. It was pretty amazing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous.

Assumed satellite- but low height, high speed, unusual path of travel<n> <n><n> <n><n> Myself and two others were sitting outdoors on the 18th.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Our friend pointed out what he thought was a sattelite moving across the sky.  I did not note the exact time - I beleive it was approximately 10:30pm.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I picked up the object and followed its path.  The object was moving in a straight line.  No lights were detected or trails behind it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Numerous things stuck us initally: 1) It was agreed amongst us that it was moving significantly faster than other satellites or shooting stars we have seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 2)It seemed very low for a satellite.  I can not give an estimate of height, but, it appeared that the object was almost close enought that we could pick out details of the object, not just a general shape profile.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 3) It seemed of reasonable size - potentially due to the low height??  Larger than other satellites I have seen by approximately 4-5 fold.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At approximately a 25° angle, the speed of the object slowed slightly and it moved in a half-circle profile.  I would suggest that the radius of the bend took place over 5-10° of the horizon.  On completion of the half-circle profile, the object then resumed a straight line course.  It appeared to be on a fairly similar path as to the one it was following prior to the half-circle.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Observers: #1 - 32 year old male.  Engineer #2 - 54 year old male.

It was in the Eastern sky and it was bright and large with shoots stemming from it and there were four others (smaller or much further away) with red, green and blue flashing lights.I wanted to explain it off to planes but i woke my wife and she saw thje same thing and asked about the rays shooting out from the large yellow object she got nervous and dident want to watch any longer after a few m,oments loking thru binoculars. They all stayed motonless in the early eastern sky till the clouds blocked my view. I really wanted to right it off to planes or satellites but we never saw them before or since that early morning.<n> <n><n> <n><n> large yellowish light in eastern sky<n> <n><n> <n><n> On or around 4:15am i was awakened by one of our dogs barking, i went out onto the back patio and dident notice anything to be concerned about. I got a glass of water and headed back thru the back patio to our bed room and a large yellowish light cought my eye i wrote it off to an airplane untill i got to the bed side and it was 4:21am no planes would fly around here at that time. I went back out and looked up at the eastern sky and the light was still there i watched for a few moments and it dident seem to be moving, I woke my wife and asked her whats that? She got up, she dident know we both rubbed our eyes trying to get a  clearer non sleepy view but we both saw this large bright yellowish light with kind of light rays protruding from it and saw four more objects in an apparenet furhter distance they seemed to have a red, green and blue flash to them. We watched for a while thru binoculars they stayed motionless the dawn was starting to break but the fog line moved in about forty mins. after i first saw them. Any explanation to what it was?

But never any fire engines came.  I watched the light for a while and then began to video tape it.  It was egg shapped or appeared to be with a black band across the top.  It appeared to be a ridge.  The center was redish with a greenish edge.  I am sorry, but this is not venus.  I can see a clear ridge where the band is.  The video shows the red change a bit.  I hoped to spot it again but it has been cloudy.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We suspect the witness may have been looking at Venus.  PD))<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ADDENDUM FROM WITNESS:<n> <n><n> <n><n> Dont even tell me It is a planet. Cameras aren&#39;t telescopes and I captured this object with zoom lens.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I wrote before and do not see my description posted.  I have on video an object that you will try to tell me is a planet and most likely venus.  But you would have to then finish your statement with &#34;stupid&#34;.  Here is my story.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I woke up hearing a loud explosion like noise.  I thought it to be a transfomer or a gas like explosion.  I then went to my window to look for signs of fire and listen for the sounds of sirens.  There were none. While looking in the sky I noticed an airplane flying into the path of what I thought was another airplane but the light looked like it was flying toward me head on.  I then realized it did not move and the other plane flew by it and appeared to be miles away.  I then got my video camera out and began taping.  I thought I got a planet until I hooked it to my tV. NO planet.  MY camera zooms 350x.  Not a telescope.  Yet the object was clear, round with a ridge spitting out red lights, spinning several times within 2 minutes.  Planets don&#39;t spin.  I am not even a true believer but no one is going to tell me that this is venus.  Not true.  I could never have zoomed in to a planet with my camera.  Planets have not indents, lights and cant spin several times in 2 minutes with an obvious clarity.  Long Island guy in NY video taped this and I would like to chat with him.  A person in England has the same object on video tape.  I only wish I taped it longer.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The sound I heard was probably a sonic boom since there was never a need for emergency help.<n>

It had six lights on the bottom, 3 yellowish ones in the center that formed a triangle as well. 1 red one at the top point and 2 blue ones at the bottom points. It also had 1 white light at the back that was flashing. As it neared the 3 witnesses they could hear a hover like sound, which no plane could ever make. It wasn&#39;t going very fast at all, way too slow for any plane to go. It wasn&#39;t very high in the sky either. Again at 3:30 am they witnessed it again but going in the opposite direct(Westward) but it was higher in the sky this time.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was moving side to side and up and down and around in the same area. Then we noticed there was a red light also to the left of the big one.We got the camcorder out and digital camera and zoomed in on the big bright white one but it really was round with green around it and appeared to be spinning inside with different colors,(red,black,whiteand orange).At times the object when zoomed in apeared to look like a planet but then changed shape. We also have lots of pictures and video. So far from the pictures we have taken there are 9 different forms each night.  The object is a different shape in each picture taken. The pictures taken each night are all similar in shape and color. We have seen them 4 nights now in a row in the eastern sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Probably Venus.  PD))<n>

I stood tranfixed at that very light, i couldn&#39;t shout to anyone, I couldn&#39;t move away. I felt so weak, it was so beautiful it made me feel like i could not be touched. It remained there for 10 seconds in mid-air, then suddenly flew away at the speed of light and dissappeared behind a tree. It made no sound whatsoever, it was like it was never there. I got into vision with where it should have been, behind the tree but it wasn&#39;t there, it had just dissapeared, like that. I suddenly got back to my senses and noticed what had happened.

So I figured OK well I&#39;ll go get my binoculars and entertain her.  It was just a normal airplane.  So I tried looking at the airplane when she exclaimed well what is that?  It was a point of light that was changing in intensity.  It was about as bright at first as a planet in the sky.  It was approaching the airplane in the sky.  It changed angle slightly but flew mostly straight and became very dim till we could not see it.  It seemed to be heading 30 degrees south/west 0 deg = west.  It might have been following the airplane but we are not sure of the exact elevation.  Then it came back the other way also very dim and small such that we could barely make it out.  It looked to be retracing its previous path.  I remember exclaiming that it seemed unusual that it didn&#39;t have blinking lights like the air plane.  It was also white while it was bright but became o! range when it became dim and small.  To me from memory it was moving about 1.5 times faster than the airplane from our perception.  The airplane had 2 red flashing lights and heading south/west 12 degrees. 0 degrees being west.  The airplane was almost directly over head but a bit south.  Maybe 80 - 85 deg elevation by the time the unknown object was spotted heading back.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I turned around twice as I walked away from the seawall towards the street, it was still as I had seen it. The third time I turned around, it has just disappeared.

All of a sudden, a red light appeared, streaking from the northeast to the southwest.  It had a small red trail behind it, which quicly disappeared.  There was a broken cloud cover at approximately 12,000 feet.  I could not tell if the light was above or below the clouds, it happened that quick.  I have never seen anything that fast in the sky...I mean, it was RIDICULOUSLY fast.  The light was bright red.  If I hadn&#39;t been looking directly at it, I would have never seen it...it was at least as fast as a shooting star.  In fact, it kind of looked like a shooting star except for the red color, and the red trail it left.

I had gone an alternate route home than I usually do because I stopped at a gas station in my area with the lowest price for fuel as my vehicle was low.  Haveing gone this alternate route allowed me to travel on a street that gave me a clear view (Than I otherwise would have had on my normal route home.)of what we in Phx call a green belt which are various strips of land with huge power lines running through town. As I rounded my turn,1 street away from my home, I noticed a  dark/black triangular object seemingly hovering (Extremely low in an area with limited light.)facing west, directly over the power lines.  I was in astonishment and rapidly drove toward the object.  As I approched I rolled my window down as to try and hear engine noise and there was none.  As I came to a stop in the street I observed the object. Moments later Three bright white forward lights turned on along with a red strobe in the center and white strobes on 2 tip sides blinking.  The object Then began to rotate and turn sideways turning north moving off rapidly.  I pursued it as best as I could and observed it turning westward two streets further up.  The object seemed to be mimicking the flight paths of commercial traffic approching westwardly at that time both north and south of the object&#39;s position. The object however did not seem to be increasing altitude. It instead followed the same height and flight path (Which would be just south of the Phx airport.)as far as I could track it from my perspective. I then proceeded to observe commercial traffic from the north of Hwy 202 and south of Hwy 60 approching like fireflies in line on thir normal flight paths for a westward approch into the Phx airport.  All the other air traffic altitudes seemed much higher. Later I returned home and related my expirence to friends and family.  I then remembered I still had a phone number for an individual I spoke with over three years ago,who is a member of MUFON and gave me a card. I called him and gave my account of my sighting.  I,however, am not a member of any related group.  I felt that mabey my information could be useful in the event that someone else might have witnessed the same thing.  We talked of details and found it interesting that this occurred on the nite after the new moon, a dark, clear nite sky.  He referred me to this web site to submit a report.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Then breaking off in several groups. Some coming toward our ship and nearly directly over head. They glowed very brightly. I was able to take a picture of them. The first showed that the were round or oval shape. They broke off quickly as I took the second picture and only got three of them again having the same shape.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The following I sent a mesage to officer on deck that night and never recieved  an answer.  However I did meet the captain of the ship and mentioned what I had seen and never heard from him either. Aboard the ship were several naturalist describing the area daily.  Questioning them the seemed to think perhaps it was a flock of sea guls. But could not explain why the were glowing. I am stil confused as what we did see. Would be glad to answere any further questions you may have.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Yhank you, ((name deleted))<n>

8/16/04 22:15|Granite Falls|WA|Changing|6 HOURS|A bright object with flashing colored lights and consistent back and forth movement appeared in the Northwest Sky at about 10PM.|8/24/04|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/038/S38698.html|307|ndxe200408| A bright object with flashing colored lights and consistent back and forth movement appeared in the Northwest Sky at about 10PM.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I was about to fall asleep on Sunday night my wife noticed that there was what she called a &#34;star that was moving&#34;. We went outside to our driveway and saw a reddish-blue object at about 50 degrees azimuth off the horizon in the Northwest sky about the size of Mars or Venus but brighter, with what seemed to be flashing rotating red, blue, green &amp; yellow lights. My first impression was that it was a planet but upon closer observation we both saw that it was moving left to right and up and down without any specific pattern. The movement suggested that the object was &#34;hovering&#34;. The movement would be as much as 5-7 degrees in either direction at medium speed. I then noticed what appeared to be an aircraft with a blue light approach the object from the West and disappear once it reached the object. After the apparent aircraft disappeared the &#34;hovering&#34; movement resumed and the flashing lights took on a different characteristic of rhythmic pulsing. I then went upstairs and got my video camera and began taping. This continued for 3 hours until we both became so sleepy that we had to go back to bed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with this witness via telephone, and we found him to be serious-minded.  He agreed that he might have been looking at a planet, probably Jupiter.  PD))<n>

8/16/04 21:28|Scituate|RI|Light|5 minutes|Light, moving up down and left to right  ((Possibly Jupiter??))|8/24/04|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/038/S38707.html|310|ndxe200408| Light, moving up down and left to right<n> <n><n> <n><n> On 8/16/04 I went outside to have a smoke (trying to quit) I was looking up at the stars as I often do. I noticed a light white in appearance with a red/blue/green tinge mixed in about the size of the head of a common pin at arms length. At first I thought it was a small air craft but then it started to move to the right and then to the left then up and down. This movement happened in an area that if you held a quarter (.25 cents) at an arms length, that diameter. My observation was looking due west and up aproximately 40 degrees. I live in a rural area and it is very dark at night and there was no moon. I should also note that there was another aircraft traveling due east, the distance apart was would be 30 inches if you held out both of your arms and pointed an index finger to each object. I believe the aircraft would have been able to see the light if it were traveling in the opposite direction. The event lasted from 21:28 to 21;33 about 5 minutes(Ilooked at my wristwatch as soon as I saw the light, and when I could no longer see it). The light was bright at first then became dim and finally just went out. It did not streak off or away. I would put the light some where over eastern Connecticut although it was observed from Rhode Island. I would guess the light was 15 to 20 miles away from my observation location but it is only a guess as distance is hard to judge. I could hear the small air craft as it steadally flew in the opposite direction. This is the first posting I have ever done although I have had two other sightings over the last two years from the same observation location.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  The witness describes an object in that area of the sky where Jupiter would be seen.

8/16/04 21:00|Billings (southeast of)|MT|Light|5 minutes|It was a reoccuring visual object then followed by an occurrence of thunderous noise in the same area.|9/9/04|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/039/S39112.html|311|ndxe200408| It was a reoccuring visual object then followed by an occurrence of thunderous noise in the same area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were camped on Buster Creek about 40 miles South of Billings, Mt. in a rural setting approximately twenty miles West of Yellowtail Dam in Montana.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had a camp fire light and hanging lantern light in my eyes and still saw this extremely bright blue-white light appear in the sky at about 35 degrees above the horizon almost directly east of our position. I called my wife to look and she and a son of 11 also saw it. It became extremely bright and huge, probably four times the size of the glowing Saturn. Then as if clicked off, it turned to a dot like the smallest star in the sky and turned southward. It proceeded that direction appearing as a satellite, until we lost sight of it. It made no sound and had no other disquishing lights such as wing markers or strobes on an aircraft as we know.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then again on the next evening about 30 minutes later, the light appeared in the same area, shining through a layer of clouds. I could see no other stars in the sky due to the clouds. Again there was no noise or other lights. This time two other adults saw it. When the bright light dimmed as it did the previous night, we could not track it due to the clouds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then on the night of the 19th of August we had company of two attorneys and one of their spouses at our camp. They were all from New Mexico. We were eating a late meal when we heard two loud booms like dynamite going off in the sky followed by a three thunderous, rolling booms that shook the earth, trees and camp tent. The enormous thunderous roll then turned to a vibrating thunder sound which then receded. I have never in my 60 years heard anything to compare this vibrating thunder sound with. I am also a pilot and have heard sonic booms. This was almost frightening in comparison.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Relatives of ours also heard this noise 20 miles distant but thought it was thunder as they were inside their homes. Another ranch couple only a few miles away were rattled in their bed by what they could only describe as thunder from somewhere. We at the camp had a clear view of the entire night sky and there was not a cloud from horizon to horizon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have no idea what any of this was including the light. It is strange to have three unusual events in such short time frames and in the same area. I have been in that area for most of my life and have never witnessed anything similar.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We are just hopeful that maybe someone else saw the same things and can bear witness to what we saw and heard. Neither the light we saw nor the sound are anything I can say was normal no matter how much I try to reason it out. We were somewhat reluctant to post this but will never hear from anyone else unless we do.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I witnessed from the west a white flatish like object very high, extreme white colour with no light. Shape appeared rounded with a slow floating action with a slight lift on one side and also as if it was slightly changing shape.  I rounded up 4 witnesses, 3 observed in disbelief while the fourth said it was a plastic white bag.  Wind was happening, as you can see flying fluffy seeds moving at a good speed from south to north.  This object hang stationary in the sky coming from the west to east for at least 15 minutes, than turn north into clouds.  Can plastic white bags create their own direction?  Height I would estimate was 10-20,000 feet.  (Do plastic white bags fly that high?)  Binoculars were used and this object appeared strange quite strange. (NOT A BAG)   Conditions of the sky was blue with a slight haze.  Cloudy to the north of Cummulus clouds were we lost sight of it. Duration was close to 20 minutes.  I&#39;m really sorry I don&#39;t have pictures and even if I did, you would not get much of a picture because of the high altitude.  It does feel good to have witnesses because seeing is believing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Reinforces one&#39;s sanity   Needless to say  One week after.<n> <n><n> <n><n> One of the witnesses came back to my place of work.<n> <n><n> <n><n> He changed his belief IN THOUGHT= that it was a WHITE bag..<n> <n><n> <n><n> Good grief of the mind sET TO THE UNEXPLAINED<n>

He also confirm seeing it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As we watch it together in the sky It appeared not to be moving much, as we watched it passed 10 minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Also note : One side did slightly lift up .<n> <n><n> <n><n> Like a boat on waves  I then ran into my workplace to get two more witnesses and binoculars.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The two other witnesses could also see this unknown white craft AS IT DID HAVE SIZE.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After using the binoculars to see closer.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It appeared brillant white in color- long in length No other colors or markings could be seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Still staying there near stationary.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Now a truck driver pulled in and got out of his truck And was pointed out this white UFO still sitting in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This now brought the count to four witnesses watching as well myself As we all continued to watch it wondering guessing to explain it ! This now being about 25 minutes when first seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Was now starting to move quite slowly towards the north.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I &#39;m guessing somewhere near over the Don Valley Pkwy.north.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After another five minutes we all lost sight of it in the clouds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Needless to say : two witnesses thought it was a white plastic bag for an explaination The other two could not explain the object at all.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Do plastic bags stay stationary in the same area of the sky over 25 minutes ? Even have such size at such a distance.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This was a incredible sighting to witness  I can only conclude again a presence unknown again witnessed  I also noticed one hour later There were so many jets -every direction causing crosses in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thus the clear sky was now not so good in clarity as it had been earlier at 12:00pm<n>

A Large object flew so low above us we coulda thrown a a rock at it.  It looked like half a hexagon with a long tube type front.  It had a blue light at the front of the tube and red blinking lights at the front corners of the hexagon.  It flew above us at a pace of (I would guess) 15 mph we watched it fly away behind the trees.  We may of saw several small glowing sphere ships around the area that were stationary but we&#39;re not positive about those<n>

This sighting was East (which I believe would put this over the Atlantic ocean) not very high in the sky. I looked through an ordinary pair of binoculars and was shocked to see what was cross-shape with may changing neon-like colors. They all seemed to glow from the center of this cross and radiate outward to all four points. I could see red to pink, blues, greens and yellow hues. Very vivid! I tried this with a total of three pair of binoculars and they all revealed the same thing. I can&#39;t say this was a craft of any kind, I have no idea what I was looking at. I didn&#39;t know if I was looking at stars - the others looked nothing like this. I was simply amazed! It was fixed for the 43 minutes I observed it until it became too light and I lost sight of it. I realized the last time I saw it that it was slighty higher than when I first took notice of it. I told a friend the next day who thought I was perhaps seeing Venus. I looked out the following morning around 4AM and looked around with my binoculars. I did see the same thing and called my friend who lives a bit Northeast from me. She did see what I described but said she thinks it is Venus. That would have been fine, but now on this second evening I saw two of these objects on the east, quite a distance apart from one another, and I saw a third one looking southwest from my patio. They were all this cross-shape and had these colors and they were ALL fixed. I don&#39;t know what to make of it!<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We suspect the witness was looking at a star or planet.  PD))<n>

So I jump up, whispering &#34;OH MY GOD! A FUCKING UFO!&#34; to myself. and I grab my camera, and by the time I turn it on and get it on the right setting, it&#39;s moved too far. but oh my gosh.

It looked like a lighting strike but the sky was totally clear and there was no bolt.  It was just a flash centered in one area of the sky.

There were no clouds. While they sighted this event &#34;Mike&#34; called his girlfriend on his cell phone and while taking the cell phone died. Then the camera they had which was fully charged died and would not work. The camera noted &#34;Battery Dead&#34;. When both returned home the cell phone worked and the camera as it was placed in its charger stated it had a full charge. Location was 47th and &#34;S&#34; streets. Time of sighting between 1:00 - 2:00 am Aug 16th. The craft were said to be at the height of high altitude jet flight patterns 20,000&#39;. At arms length holding a quarter the craft seemed to be the size of a quarter. No noise was associated with this event. The triangles had a half sphere shape to them. The men saw high definition shapes in the crafts bodies.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((name and URL deleted))<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous.

All three objects were composed of flashing lights. The objects were moving at a slow rate of speed in the sky. However they keep moving back and forth across long portions of the sky. All three had the same light patterns flashing. It was pretty creepy, I myself am a skeptic however others witnessed this event and have said they observed it on previous occasions. The objects made no sound, and were not moving in a discernable direction, but did move across large portions of the sky. The objects moved horizontally and vertically across the night sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

At first I thought it might be a red light on a tower, but I don&#39;t think there are any towers with red lights in the area, and I only saw one light. As I watched it, it zig zagged across the sky extremely fast and it didn&#39;t look like a pattern that a normal plane or jet could fly. This startled me and before I could stop my car to get a better look at it, it zig zagged and then suddenly disappeared. I looked every night after that but did not see it again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

My wife and children were already asleep in the cabin and my friend and his wife were asleep in the travel trailer.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I noticed an odd light in the sky, flashing blue, red and green. I got my 10X binoculars from the truck and steadied my view of the lights by leaning against the cabin. Under magnification, I could see a disk shaped object in the western sky. It reminded me of watching the tail lights of a distant car, because I was able to see an object amidst the lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I watched, it seemed that the lights weren&#39;t just flashing, but where actually rotating around the exterior of the object. There also seemed to be a haze or gas around it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After 10 miniutes of awe, I realized that no one would believe me without a witness, so I woke up my wife and asked her to come look at something interesting in the sky. She saw it immediately even without the help of binoculars and told me it was a flying saucer. She also noticed what appeared to be occaisional lightning like effects coming out from it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We watched it for another 5 minutes together before remembering that we had other adults who could witness it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I ran over and woke up my friend, telling him there was a phenomenone that I needed his opinion of.  It took him a couple of minutes to get his shoes and pants on, and followed a few steps behind me over to the shadow spot behind the cabin where my wife was still focused on the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I got to the spot where it was visible through the trees, at that moment, the bright object &#39;winked out&#39;. Both my wife and I gasped because it was just gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My friend rounded the cabin, looked up and asked what the fuss was about because he did not see anything at all. 30 seconds later, the object and light pattern re-appeared, only this time, it looked like it had moved straight out into space and was now very tiny. My wife and I were a bit shaken up at this sight. My friend was just unhappy I had woken him up to look at a wierd star. What I saw was no star.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The next weekend, it was not there and I&#39;ve never seen it again, either. I do not drink or smoke pot.

I observed directly ahead of me (west) a light that I first thought was a low-flying helicopter, due to the intensity of the light, and the fact it appeared to be not moving. I&#39;m not sure the exact distance between myself and the object, but I would have to say somewhere between 8-12 miles. At first, I thought it could have been a helicopter between 750-1000ft above ground level. The light seemed far away (see above estimate) yet it was oddly bright. I would describe the color as a yellowish white. Almost like the color of a 60 white light-buld. I was watching this object for about 5 seconds when it appeared to split in two. Each of the lights were less bright than the sum when they were connected. In altitude, they were parallel. One of the objects (the one to my right) started flying north towards South Mountain, and the one seemed to remain in place for another 3-4 seconds. Then another light appeared next to the remaining craft. This time the light was definately less bright than the &#39;main&#39; object (the remaining one of the pair). It was much closer to this object than distance between the initial two. It was about 100 ft lower in altitude, and 150ft-200ft to the left (south) of the &#39;main&#39; object. I continued driving along Pecos and then turned right (north) on 32nd street and the trees to my left temporarily blocked my view for maybe 10-15 seconds. I then turned left (west) on Liberty ln. to go to my house, and once again saw the 2 objects. They were in the same position as before, and still remaining in the one spot. I went into my house to put my dinner that I just bought at Taco Bell on the counter in my kitchen and went back outside to continue following the object. I did not see the object I had been tracking, At least not where it was before. I saw something moving north very quickly and passing right over South Mountain, but I&#39;m not sure which of any of these objects that could have been. It very well could have been a different object altogether, maybe a plane. I only got to see it for a second or two and then it disappeared over the mountain, and there was nothing else to observe, so I went back inside. One other thing I should mention is the air was very humid and there was an intense electrical storm at the time. Lightning, but with barely any rain. There was another car about a hundred feet ahead of me driving on Pecos, so he/she/they might have seen this as well. I don&#39;t see how one could have missed it.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

We sat there and watched it and noticed that it would change color from white to yellow then red. As we watched it, it started to rise. It jumped vertically probably the length of my index finger within one eye closed. It started to move right and then back left, like it was hovering. We all just looked at one another and said did you see that.  We could see two planes in the distance, one to the left of the object and one to the top right of the object. You could tell they were planes by the way the lights were flashing and there uniform movement. There were no clouds in the sky. As the plane to the left got closer to the object it just vanished.  The light from the object just distinguished and the object was gone in a second. We just sat there in awe.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I had stepped out to get some fresh air by the &#34;smoke pit&#34; and looked towards the airfield (Approximately 1 mile) to see an amber sphere stationary between the airfield and myself.  As I work on aircraft it caught my attention. I initially thought it was the moon but with a haze. However, the moon hadn&#39;t been rising till much later and was not in that area of the sky. I then considered a blimp, but it made little sense due to the proximity to the airfield and the types of aircraft that fly over that portion of the base. I had about a minute to speculate when it appeared to fold in on itself (like 3 evenly spaced dark petals. It was night after all) and silently disapeared. At no point did I hear any sound. Unfortunately, I didn&#39;t have another witness with me. It was a hand span above the horizon. It was as large as a full moon when on the horizon (when its size appears largest). The object was bright (but not glaring) and featureless.<n> <n><n> <n><n> If it hadn&#39;t been for the way it disappeared I&#39;d have passed it off for my being unobservant of my surroundings. The following morning I looked to that region to see if I had missed some sot of tower or structure in that area but there was nothing to break the horizon. As for the way it folded; the &#34;petals&#34; were evenly spaced at 10,2, and 6 o&#39;clock. Also note the petals were unseen until it actually occured. It seemed very odd for me to see it as a perfect sphere and the fold to be so even for it to be a local military related event that I just happened to witness. These observations made me want to share this.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Also, (since I marked aircraft were nearby) there are/ were aircraft taking off or landing on a 24 hour basis. I did not observe anything making inspection passes. This would prove difficult considering its proximity to the field and the period of time that I saw it. (pilots don&#39;t sit in the plane waiting for UFO intercepts, and the passing of a launch alerts takes 5 -10 min)  I am late reporting this as I hadn&#39;t heard (or thought to try due to obvious distractions) of this site until a few days ago.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

I sent my son in the house to get the binoculars so I could get a closer look. As soon as he handed the binoculars to me, it disappeared. I told him to set the binoculars beside the pool just incase I saw it again I would grab the binoculars. We were just talking about the object so I forgot to look back at it again.

I ran into my house and got my binoculars, when I got got back it was maneuvering erratically a little to the north. When I got a good look at it, it was a black triangle with a bright red line accross the back. It was wider than long, like a large hang-glider.  After about 30 seconds it stopped and rotated slowly in place one complete turn then shot off to the east like a bullet.  The sky was mostly clear and blue with a few puffy white clouds.  It looked to me to be as high as commercial air traffic which would have made it about the size of a 747.  I noticed no sound but I could hear a jet at about the same altitude a few seconds later moving in almost the same direction.  The triangle left no contrail but the jet did.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The sun was at full shine with no cloud coverage at top average airline altitude.  I looked out the window as I often do on flights and saw this black cylinder shaped object flying within reaching distance to the airline window.  This black cylinder had a semi-sphere head that resembled a basic security camera gloss, possibly made out of glass.  This object was no bigger than half the size of my forearm in both length and width.  As I was watching it fly just a bit faster than average airline speed covering an extra foot every 2 seconds, I had no quick access to a camera or possibly alerting another individual fast enough before it was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have no evidence of this event as far as other witnesses or footage.  This object was seen years ago and I only have my word to back this claim.  I will say knowing I was lacking witnesses and camera footage, I kept telling myself to fully memorize the moment.  I didn’t take my eye off of it for a second and studied every visible thing I could.  This object was also in no way attached to the airline, but clearly had the confidence of flying so close on the brightest of days.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I fully believe what I saw was far more advanced as far as flight technology than anything I have ever seen, even as basic as it looked.<n>

I looked up and said &#34;Wow, the sky is really clear tonight.&#34; Me being fasinated with the stares keeped on looking up for about 5 minutes, when all of a sudden I see something that i thought was a star start to move.  I ask ((name deleted)) if he saw it move and he said no, so we both waited to see if it would move agian and it started to move agian.  I asked &#34;((name deleted)) did u see that!?&#34; and he replys &#34;Yes! What is that?!&#34;  In amazment we layed down and watched this object that looked like a simple star dart across the sky, stop, then quickly jerk in the opposet direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We&#39;ve gone back there many times after that night and we almost always see these objects.  I have even brought my girlfreind there to witness them.  This one night I was looking up and saw what i thought was an octigonal constalation of some sort, but when one  of the stares broke off and started moving i was really suprised, then another would break off.  I am really confedent that if almost anyone would just simply look up at the sky at night for more then 5 minutes...some of those things we think are stars..might just be a discised ufo!  I&#39;ve done resurch on ballons and satalites and nothing comes close to this.<n>

I notice the lakes, the size, (i love observing land shapes beneath me), anyways I spotted a red giant ball shape ( in flame type on top of a mountain), I thought it was a fire truck, (I realze Im so high into the sky) that it can&#39;t be, because I just passed some waters, and they are only a size of half my plans...The red light ball rolled down the mountains, travel between the hills, up another mountain, traveled on top of the ridges, and disappeared...What got my attention was the spead it went up the mountian, and how fast it traveled in the terrain...<n> <n><n> <n><n>

My friend and I decided to go fishing in his small boat about 0700.  We motored out across the lake to begin trolling.  After a while his motor stopped running.  As he was fixing his fishing pole, I began to hear a faint Jet engine sound approaching.  Because I am a pilot and work in aviation, I always look up to indentify aircraft.  The sound was approaching from the east and behind me.  I looked and followed the sound but saw nothing.  I continued until the sound was overhead.  This is when I saw the ball shapped objects side by side.  They were probably 1,000 ft AGL, moving at maybe 200 to 250 KTS or faster.  They were aircraft aluminum in color.  They all moved independently of each other and appeared to be trying to stay side by side at the same speed.  My friend then looked but did not see them.  He did hear the sound.  They continued to the west for about 1 more second, then dissapeared<n>

We were on the beach in very early morning sitting on life guard chair with clouds after the rain.  I&#39;ve noticed some kind of light in the skies coming from the ocean behind the clouds, as it came closer it appeared under the clouds at the height of about 1 km.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Size of it must of been enormous (if u took a quarter and distanced it from yourself between your fingers-that would approximately describe the size) it moved at the speed of about 5000-10000 km/h with absolute silence over our heads.  It took about 15 seconds to cover the distance from horizon to zenith.  Right after it disappeared in clouds on the side of the continent it started to dawn, as if it was traveling in the last wave of darkness.  We were astonished because it wasn&#39;t any type of aircraft known to this day.  Fire was active, but appeared to be cold, as if you looked at the sparklers throu! gh heavy green mist, but there was no mist and object appeared to be between and under the clouds.<n>

I was picking up my girlfriend to give her a ride to work at about 5 am in a very populated area when I spotted a black triangle in the sky at approx. 500-1000 ft above ground level.  It moved from east to west.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I immediately identified it as a ufo because it had only 3 lights, one at each corner of it&#39;s triangle shape. All three lights were white.  The lights were not bright and were pointed down.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I opened my window and heard no noise, just silence.  I tried to follow it, but could not keep up in the city block grid system.  I estimate that it was moving at about 30mph.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have heard that there has been ongoing activity in this area of the Twin Cities for some years.  Some claim that the river is an attractive spot to these craft.  The nearest airport would depart aircraft in nowhere near this direction and the departing airplanes would have certainly gained thousands of feet of elevation at this distance.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

I knew i was awake because my arm, which i had broken a week before, was in pain. I looked around to see what the noise was, didn&#39;t see anything, and eventually fell back asleep. about 10 minutes later i woke up again, but the sound was much louder. Upon looking outside, i saw what appeared to be five crescent-shaped flying objects hovering and moving at an extremely slow speed (slower than an average walk, i would guess). They were about 70 feet above the house two doors down from where i was. They stayed there for a bout five minutes. Upon telling this to my friend, i learned that he saw a similar incident three nights before.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

8/15/04 02:50|Firebaugh Exit|CA|Other|1 min - 2 mins|Was it a UFO or some strange goverment experiment; or was it simply a kid's prank in the middle of nowhere?|8/24/04|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/038/S38702.html|353|ndxe200408| Was it a UFO or some strange goverment experiment; or was it simply a kid&#39;s prank in the middle of nowhere?<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had a really weird experience last weekend...Don&#39;t know what to believe anymore...<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were driving back from Los Angeles, CA to my home in San Jose, CA and were on the I-5 near the Firebaugh area. I knew I was here since my GPS in my car showed me that area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Suddenly there was heavy fog which almost made me not see the road and I slowed down a bit, after the fog somewhat cleared, I saw two lights like the headlights of a car going alongside my car in my window. First I thought it might be a reflection but there was no other cars around me for miles that I could see. I took my window down to see more closely. It seemed like a glider of some sort so my first thought was that maybe its some sort of radar device which the government uses to check speeds of vehicles on the highways or a helicopter. But it none of those. Then it glided down really smoothly and quite beautifully almost touching the ground giving me an idea it was landing. I was looking ahead and looking at it at the same time and slowed my car a bit also.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Being honest, at that point I was a little scared as the object without landing just took off again and went over in front of me over the highway across and it cast two lights in the field. The lights were just like ordinary white lights throughout but the object seemed like it was spinning. It stood in the field for about 5-10 seconds casting those lights in a triangulated fashion really beautifully. The object suddenly turned from there and came straight for my car, the lights from it were really bright, almost blinding; at which point I was getting paranoid that whatever it was going to hit my car. But it came on the top of my car and was gone! Yes it was just gone, disappeared totally. I also looked into my back mirror but there was nothing there except absolute darkness. I took the next exit for the gas station and a little while later an SUV stopped from which a lady emerged and I tried to ask her if she saw something. But I guess it was the time of the night, I saw the look in her eyes which was telling me I&#39;m some kind of weirdo...I was yelling for my friends to wake up as they were sleeping but they confirmed to me later they did see some kind of light as at that point they had woken up.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I do not know what to make out of it but I know what I saw and it lasted for a good minute or maybe more. It was just a beautiful object, what it was I think I&#39;ll never know but what I saw I&#39;ll never be able to forget.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I alerted my friend who was to the left of me. ( we where outide on a 2nd story balcony) He first thought that it was just a weather baloon or something. But I inisted that it was something else.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About 30 seconds later it moved quickly aross our faces and then up. It seemed as if it rolled back on its side and began to flash in sequence 4 lights on its bottom side.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After that I called to my other friends inside to come and look. About 4-5 minutes past as t finished with its lights. We saw it move foward and begin shooting out some kind of gunor lazer or something.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After it finished it slowly began to move up( about 2min.) After about 2 min it took off without a trace<n>

I also like attempting to track satellites and orbiting booster rockets using my scopes&#39; electronic drive. The atmospheric conditions had steadily been getting worse all night and because my scope is somewhat labor intensive to set up, I decided not to bring it out after glancing Northwest and noticing a star flickering more than usual, typically a sure sign of turbulence in the air and generally poor &#34;seeing&#34;, also the scattered cloud cover was quickly changing to broken while moving from WSW to ENE.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At that point, I noticed the &#34;star&#34; had some distinct red flashes mixed with some green and was quickly looking like one of the many commercial jets that overfly the area heading either N-S or S-N. I then began looking at the object closer and could clearly see multiple red lights and one green light and also that it looked to be at fairly high altitude but curiously, the object appeared to be motionless and looked to be between magnitude 0 and -1.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Intrigued, I stood still and stared at it, comparing the distance of the lights laterally(about the width of my fist held out at arms length) to a nearby tree for approximatley 5 minutes during which time the object never moved. At that point, the object began to slowly move ENE, decreasing the distance to the edge of the tree by about 30% over a period of 20-25 seconds before stopping again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My thinking at that time was that this was most likely a helicopter but possibly a U.S Marine AV-8 Harrier in hover mode. However, what happened next left me absolutley stunned.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The lights began slowly moving ENE(left to right) again but VERY rapidly increased to roughly 5 times the speed that I&#39;ve observed the International Space Station cross the sky and in about 2 seconds it disappeared behind the tree causing me to verbally exclaim &#34;Whoaaa..Ho Ho!!&#34; and blink several times.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I then walked West out to the sidewalk and reaquired the object which had stopped again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was extremely tempted by now to go inside and make an attempt to assemble my telescope, drag it out and get a good look at it but was worried that by the time I got it up and running the lights would have moved off or more likely be covered by the now increasing clouds but I had to get SOME sort of closer view besides the naked eye and after watching the lights in the new position for about 2min I decided to compromise and run into the house and grab binoculars, leaving my slippers where I had last been standing to aid in reaquirment. What I saw thru the binoculars was very clear even while holding them freehand.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There were 3 very red lights in an arrowhead triangle &#34;V&#34; pattern, the point appeared to be facing ESE, directly between the 2 red lights on the &#34;short side&#34; of the triangle was a distinctly greenish-white light and in the center of the object was an orange light that was flashing on and off irratically. I then began walking North on the sidewalk about 25ft to two cars parked parallel in front of my house stepping between them and sitting on the bumper of one and resting my elbows on the trunk of the other to steady the image.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I then noticed the area between the red lights was slightly but noticably darker than the surrounding sky and after about 8 min I witnessed the object &#34;yaw&#34; to my left and now point to about 170 deg. The yaw manuever took between 1-2sec.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About a minute later, the orange light ceased flashing and stayed on solidly but then the red light on what I describe as the objects&#39; right(starboard) side(my left)began flashing rapidly at a rate of about 3 times per second for 7-10 seconds then up to nearly strobe light speed for 3-4 seconds then back to solid red for about 50sec and back to flashing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This went on for about 12min then all the lights stayed on solidly until clouds began obscuring them but just as the lights were about 70% obstructed, I again noticed they appeared to be flashing again, even thru the clouds until they were completely obscured.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;m 39 and I have been seriously involved with astronomy for 7 years and am used to feilding questions about what someone &#34;saw&#34; from the public at starpartys and explaining what it was and why it appeared the way it did. I also have been heavily interested in all forms of aviation since the age of 9. I put this object thru every trial I could think of during the event, moving position to make sure it wasn&#39;t a reflection off telephone wires etc. This object was not, from my perspective, ANY kind of celestial body I know of or have ever witnessed before, including satellite de-orbits, Bolides or fireballs. This object was MOST DEFINATLEY inside the atmosphere and appeared to be solid. I would describe this event as having the highest &#34;Wow&#34; factor of my entire career looking skyward. I will most certainly be looking again!<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with this witness via telephone, and we found him to be quite objective in his description of the object, and most credible.  We do not know what he saw.  PD))<n>

(no!  this is not a joke)<n> <n><n> <n><n> It&#39;s been a long time since I saw this craft. It definetely never leaves my mind. I know I&#39;m not crazy nor is my 15 yr old who saw this craft with me. the strange thing is that we were 5 total and only two of us saw it in plain view. hope i can make myself clear, bear with me folks.<n> <n><n> <n><n> it was dark and late, my 4 kids and I walked over to the nieghborhood park . the park is only 2 minutes from my house. when we got to the park, i sat down a moment and happen to look into the sky,  north of us over the 1-10 freeway.  I saw a big bright light. it looked really round.  the light stood there or seemed to be still for about 5 minutes. then i saw it descend as if it were falling. it stopped decending then started coming our way which was south of it&#39;s location. my son and i made a fuss over this light and became concerened as it started getting closer to us, we noticed it was right over us in less than 2 minutes.  I cannot explain the length of time that we stared at this scary thing in the sky, time seemed to pass forward and we didnt realize what had happen to us for about 2 1/2  hours. it was after 1:20 am when we cought ourselves screaming and running into the house and the 3 other kids ages vary from 9 to 14 yrs of age did not see a thing nor did they understand why my 15 yr old son and I were running frantically from the park.  only that we were five total and it only attracted 2 of us. please anyone, if this same thing happen to you please let us all know.  This is what my son and I saw that night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I do hereby swear and promise on the holy bible in the presence of our lord as our whitness that this is the truth and the whole truth as best remembered so help us God.   In the sky above us this night, we saw a huge pitch black triange with dull soft lighting coming from the 2 back corners of the craft as though it were lit up slightly from the inside.and maybe light was visable through a dim window or glass. it had  a red light that glowed from the bottom center but not bright, it was more like a red light like from heat that&#39;s generated.. like how hot coals would glow. I could see well because the craft had descended so low that I could hear it and I could see something undernieth the belly. like markings. it was not a stealth bomber nor did it have any other shape other than a perfect triangle. it was very still for the most part. long enough for me to notice the sound that it made.  the height it hovered was no more than the tallest street lights in a city. it seemed to be as wide as maybe a football field. it was very  still and very quiet. my son and I froze with fear and ran away leaving my kids at the park. when i realize what i had done i ran back to the park and it was still there hovering over the park and that&#39;s when i noticed the strange lines under the craft. it seem to have markings like a map. they were black or very dark or smokey grey. and barely visable. the craft did make a sound. it was a whispering soft humming unlike anything i heard. my ac makes more noise than the craft did. i would say the sound was similar to that of a brand new computer that hums perfectly with just a slight bit of air flowing through it. the scary thing is that we were so close to it and only 2 of us saw it, what I dont get is we get to the park around 11:05pm no later that for sure. but cannot remeber why it took us almost 3 hours to run home! our home was only 2 houses away, less than 1 minute down the sidewalk. when we ran away we saw it take off slowly to the south west towarsd phx. I watched it for 2 minutes then it simply vanished. most of all we cannot explain the loss of time and why only 2 of us saw this triangle in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

At first I thought it was an aircraft but then realized there was no sound and if it were landing lights on an aircraft at say airliner cruzing altitudes it would not have been as bright as it was.  The light was moving at a steady pace (like an airliner) when it suddenly dissapered and then reapered on the western horizon just a moment later (3 seconds, entirely too fast to be an airplane) this time the light had stopped moving.  it stayed at its present spot for about three minutes and then it appered to start climbing straight up. (not going east to west or north to south just straight up)  the light was getting smaller as it climbed untill it looked like a faint distant star and moved at an amazing speed back to the eastern horizon and disapered.  I was about to contact dispatch however I felt really awkward and did not want to lose credit or respect with my peers.  However, since this event two days ago I have been losing sleep thinking about it and decided to do some internet research and thats when I found your web site and this reporting section.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It then changed to two white lights that moved around irradically with a small object also moving. We steadied our binouclars and lined them up with a star that didn&#39;t move.The lights on the object then went out for seconds and reappeared with what looked more like something with two bright white lights which then headed in our direction. When it went over our heads we could identify 3 lights and the object was very large moving very fast and some sound that was similir to a distant plane. All this took approx. 5 mins. but when it decided to move it went very fast over head. The most strange part was that it moved around, up and down, side to side very rapidly.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

THE OBJECT WAS THE SIZE OF A PIN HEAD AT ARMS LENGTH AND APPEARED TO BE HOLDING POSITION. I WENT INSIDE TO GET MY BINOCHULARS AND BEGAN OBSERVING THE OBJECT BOTH WITH THE UNAIDED EYE AND WITH THE GLASSES. THE OBJECT GLOWED WITH THE COLORS OF SILVER, RED AND BLUE. I OBSERVED THE OBJECT FOR ABOUT 10 MINUTES ALL OF THAT TIME THE OBJECT HAD NOT MOVED. wHILE OBSEVING THE OBJECT WITH FIELD GLASSES ANOTHER OBJECT OF THE SAME SIZE AND COLOR CAME INTO MY VISION FROM THE NORTH HEADING SOUTH AND APPEARED TO MERGE WITH THE FIRST OBJECT. THE OBJECT THEN MOVED EAST AT THE SPEED OF A FIGHTER JET AND I LOST SITE OF IT. TWO MINUTES LATER I FOUND THE OBJECT AGAIN. IT HAD MOVED EAST AND A LITTLE NORTH FROM THE PREVIOUS LOCATION. I OBSERVED THE OBJECT FOR ANOTHER 5 MINUTES WHILE IT MOVED DUE SOUTH AT A SLOW SPEED UNTIL I NO LONGER COULD SEE THE OBJECT. THE OBJECT WAS ALWAYS VARY HIGH IN THE SKY AND MADE NO SOUND. THE COLORS OF THE OBJECT REMAINED THE SAME DURING MY OBSERVATION.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

ButI was filming the people at Jackson trial and TV trucks.I late saw the film, after it was developed, then I saw semi-circle objects with a semi-circle craft with a short right wing only and another large craft with two (objects unknown payloads) on it was back of the second large craft. I was in position as 45 degree in a climb angle mode. I donot believe in UFO. The Small craft was in a vertical poision with two engines at tial and third engine in the middle of small. It was an unknown craft with no marking or USA ID. There were Lasers shotting at the crafts and other fireground from the ground. I was in Santa Barbara County in California during Jackson Trial on Main Street. I have picture of the crafts. Can this be an UFO? I am requesting feedback. Where can I check, if the crafts in the pictures is an UFO?  are there other reported during 8-04 to 9-04 period.  What test can I perform? Was there any crash during this time frame near Santa Barbara?  WJS reported 11-10-04<n>

It was only one flash, it happend so quick I looked straight up and there was nothing their. I ask my self if I&#39;m tripping, the ground was light up by a light with the intensity for my to see the grass as clear as I did, I&#39;m convinced I&#39;m not, I was not lightnig but with the same effect.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Our houses back onto a large field and its very dark so its easy to see stars and stuff. To the north west there was a small object that looked like an airplane or a star at first glance, but when we watched it, it stayed in one spot, sometimes moving from side to side quickly, but back to its same spot again.  When we looked at it through the binoulars you could clearly see red, blue and green lights moving in a circle around the object.  They looked like Christmas lights, they were so colourful and brilliant.  The object looked like a sort of triangle, big at the top and skinnier towards the bottom.  We watched for about 40 mins and then it faded off, getting farther away, then reappearing for a second and then completely gone.  It didn&#39;t go up into the sky, but just disappeared over the horizon.  I called the news to see if anyone else reported this, but all the lines were busy.  We never heard anything about it since.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Brother reports a bright light in the middle of the night, like a bright full moon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We had the following strange experience while camping in the Laurel Ridge State Park at the route 653 adirondacks on 8/13/04-8/14/04.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was camping with my brother and his two sons. It was their first campout. We stayed up until about 00:00 8/14/04. Between the hours of 00:00 and 03:00 I had a strange dream.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have alot of strange dreams, nothing new.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I dream of a red-ish light shinning from outside the adirondak and a high pitch pentrating noise associated with it. The light and sound were paralising me and forcing me to sleep. I dreamed I was fighting to stay awake, trying to get to my pistol. I dreamed I had the pistol in my sleeping bag.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At three in the morning I awoke and heard owls. I looked for my pistol in my sleeping bag were I was sure I had put it.It was however outside the bag were I had left it when I went to sleep. I said to my brother, &#34;Are You Awake?&#34; He said Yes. I said &#34;Do you hear those owls?&#34; He said,&#34;They sound like little kids playing.&#34; We were all awake, each one of us. At 0300 in the morning. I got up and put more wood on the fire with the help of my younger nephew. At 0335 we all tried to go back to sleep, but the kids kept screwing around. So my brother got up at 0410, and we all got up.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I knew I&#39;d had a few wierd dreams and told about them, but I held back the dream of the paralizing light. I didn&#39;t want to scare the kids. I knew it was an alien encounter kind of a dream. What was really strange, what prompted me to send this e-mail, and what has me thinking about this whole campout, is what my brother said that morning. He said that &#34;Sometime after we went to sleep, after 00:00, he had looked out of the adirondack and the woods were all lit-up like a full moon. He describe how the leaves on the trees had reflected the moonlight. Well there was barely a moon on the night of 8/13/04, with the new moon on 8/16/04. He was sure there had been a full moon that night. I haven&#39;t asked the kids if they remember anything about that night. I don&#39;t want to scared them.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

So, I was watching it move really quickly across, like most satellites do, when it started flashing red. [The reason we see satellites is they are far enough out in the earths orbit, that the sunlight hits them and reflects back to earth] When it started flashing red I followed it even more intensely, when it suddenly slowed down. I had now reasoned that it was not a satellite due to the blinking and slowing down. I figured thus it must be an airplane that’s just at an extremely high altitude. But two things got in the way. A: Why didn’t I see the red flashes of light earlier and B: How could it slow down to almost a complete halt. To top it off, the object took a 90-degree turn and sped up and the red flashing got brighter and more rapid. (It might have been a coincidence with a passing plane I just didn’t see, but at the time it sped up, I heard a faint, low rumble like a rocket). That is all I have to say.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Suddenly above and somewhat behind us a single starlike dot began darting around the sky in a random path.  It moved extremely quickly, much faster than any satellite or craft know to us move.  We saw the individual dot for about 5 seconds.  We watched it move behind us, when, we noticed another shape made up of about 10 points of white light in a chevron formation with a somewhat soft point seem to intercept the single dot.  The larger shape passed from a far point behind us, all the way over us, then disappear into the horizon in about 10 seconds.  While there were no visible clouds, the sky was partly hazy or fuzzy.  The stars did not appear very clearly.  The object we saw was slightly dimmer but the same color as the stars and satellites we saw pass overhead.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

At first I thought the whispering was my son, however upon answering, and looking to my right, I saw the entity.

I was facing north and suddenly a bright light caught my right eye fronm the right side of the Milky way ( I think that is that cloudy apperanced). When I looked directly at it, it grew very large and bright and seemed to be coming directly at me. It grew to be larger than any of the stars (or planets) in the sky, I am certain the &#34;Morning Star&#34; would have been covered completly by it were they aligned. It seemed to stop and hold position for approx. three seconds,Then it made an obvious turn, paralled it&#39;s original pathway and grew steadily smaller until it was about the same size as the sattelites seemed and then it turned to the right( my right) and grew smaller until I could no longer see it. At first I thought it might hit me, then, breifly I thought it was an aircraft, then I realized it was too high for the landing lights to be that bright and I heard nothing but the night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I Still don&#39;t know if I wish to believe in UFO&#39;s or not, I was awed for the first time in my 54 year life. I still son&#39;t know what to think.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It took about ten seconds to return(travel back out of sight.)<n>

Towards the west maybe around a 40 degree angle above the horizion, I saw at first what appeared as a star.  Then I noticed it moving back and forth (the lights would get brighter and dimmer) and side to side.  I knew it wasn&#39;t a star, and it could not be an aircraft because the side to side movement was fast enough not to match any aircraft speeds.  As I continued to watch, an airplane off in the distance kinda near it went by, which it then fadded so that i could no longer see it.  Then it reappeared after the airplane past by it.  It continued to move back and forth, and side to side, and I lost track of the lights as it went closer down to the horizon where the trees obstructed my vision.  The erratic movement and the fading of a single light, (possible more than one light) also the duration of 30 minutes of which I observed, is what lead me to truely beleive that it was an UFO. At times there was a little haze around the object, but because it was a distance from me, I couldn&#39;t always see it, but when it came the closest to me, I thought I may have seen more lights, possible blue and green.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  The witness was looking in that area of sky where Jupiter can be found at that time of night on the date in question.

Around 11:15 to 11:40 ( we were away from watches and cell phones so time is approxamate) we witnessed a small dot cross clock-wise accross the sky above us.  It was not traveling as fast as the satillites we had seen that night and both my father and I were commenting on this fact when the &#34;dot&#34; seemed to turn on a very bright light.  The light came down towards us at an angle.  It became the brightest object in the sky.  It slowly faded back to the &#34;dot&#34; and continued away from us in an erratic pattern.  Both my father and I were totally transfixed on this object and are very certain of what we&#39;ve seen. When I dropped my Dad off at his house , he immediatly turned on his scanner.  He just caught the last end of a conversation about someone awaiting a call back from NORAD.  We have seen nothing in our paper about the object, but a lot of people were out watching the meteor shower so I find it hard to believe that no one else saw what Dad and I saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was Thursday, and not alot of activity was taking place which felt strange.  Only one club on each side of the river seemed to be open...with music and people..about 12 club/restaurants were closed... Any way...as we walked from the west bank toward the right bank, we stopped to glance at the view.  As we stood looking, I looked up and noticed a white fuzzy light above us traveling in an oval shaped pattern, and each time it revolved at the right end it sort of &#34;flashed&#34; slightly and without stopping, continued it&#39;s revolution.  I mentioned it to my husband as it looked to be part of the low cloud coverage (it was very cloudy that evening)....or &#34;above&#34; and in the cloud itself.  He thought it was caused by party/search lights, but there was no line of light source to this moving light.  I watched it circle above me, and it appeared to cover about 60 feet from where I stood...I do not know how low it was..and that is strange because the clouds were low, but...it was as high as the cloud....I am a skywatcher, and it just gets me that hardly anyone looks up at the sky.  As we proceeded to walk to the right bank, the &#34;light&#34; followed us.  We crossed a bridge, we walked across a very long empty parking lot....still above us.  We went into a club...and walked out the back...there it was above us.  We walked to the back and stood out on the dock...there it was.  We stayed awhile, and it just kept &#34;circling&#34; with it&#39;s flash.....I was a little nervous about it.  When we decided to back track and walk back to our car (same distance), it did the same thing.  My husband just ignored it, and that was a little weird...I thought maybe he just did not want to know any more about it....I decided to stop looking at it.  I never mentioned it to anyone at the club because they would probably laugh at me....but when we were on the &#34;dock&#34; patio...the people out there were just dancing or drinking or talking and not paying attention.  It seemed strange that no one would look up...anyway...I cannot figure this one out...My rational mind is trying to reason it out...but this light had an intelligence about it.  I could only make a shape from the precise and constant pattern of the light...it illuminated the clouds and had no sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous.

Its trajectory was north to south at an altitude of about 1000 feet AGL.  The object was flying level straight in open sky and was approaching a cloudbank.  Just before it reached the clouds it morphed instantly from a &#39;dome&#39; shape into a &#39;diamond wedge&#39; and seem to become more transparent, disappearing into the clouds all together.  This was no rogue cloud caught in a fluke wind stream; it flew with a purpose and sense of stealth.  Its flight path was directly under Sky Harbor&#39;s approach route and a commercial airliner flew over a few minutes later.  I estimated the size of the object to be that of 2- 3 jumbo jets in length and height.  My girlfriend also witnessed the object and was as stunned as I.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((ADDENDUM FROM WITNESS--MAY 03, 2010.))<n> <n><n> <n><n> Dear Mr. Davenport,<n> <n><n> <n><n> Almost 5 years ago I filed a report with NUFORC concerning a cloud shaped/textured object over Phoenix.

The street was wet, but there was no standing or pooled water in the area, no lightening, and very little wind at that time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object did not appear to be self-luminous (which was probably good, because we could see surface details that could have been concealed by lights) but was very well lighted not only by my car&#39;s headlights but by a street light which was directly above the general area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The bi-convex disc (a color illustration is provided, but it only shows the object edge-on)looked to be made of maybe some hybrid type material that reminded me of nothing so much as tan rock with light gray coloration on the flat top of the disc, which disc also has a flange on both sides, but a flat bottom.  The flange on the top was thicker than that on the bottom.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On both the top and bottom flanges, one could see distinct and slightly inset grooves, evenly spaced like approximately 1/8-inch successive layers of a geological substrate, as if the thing were either constructed in layers or else had some kind of coils (one above the other)upon or just beneath the surface! I have pretty effectively illustrated these in the rendering provided, but have not attempted to illustrate the peripheral planes of successive small, dark &#39;dots&#39; that actually looked somewhat recessed, in various planes around the thing.  The reason I have not tried to render those dots in the illustration is because I am not absolutely sure whether those recessed dots were between the recessed peripheral grooves (which are illustrated) or actually within them.  I think the later was the case, but just am not sure,  because it all happened so fast.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Anyhow, once the disc (which traveled only about 1/4 to 1/2 inch above the street in a most wonderfully smooth gliding motion resembling an ice hockey puck sliding on ice) came to what may have been the exact middle of the street, and without slowing down (just as the &#39;textbook&#39; UFO), it immediately was suddenly going the same speed in the opposite direction(!), taking it right back across in front of our car (which was stopped or nearly stopped at that point)for a second-chance view.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When the bi-convex disc reached the curb (at the same place it had suddenly appeared), it just as suddenly vanished right before our eyes!  So, I accelerated up to the nearby intersection, made a fast U turn, and went back, to see if we could see the thing again, or some trace of it, but nothing was found.  No cars with occupants were seen in the area just before, during, or just after the encounter,  but that is not surprising in that residential neighborhood on a rather rainy night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We heard no sound that we associated with the object.  We felt no electrical sensations or unusual heat or cold, either.  The car engine did not fail, and there was no missing time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The whole thing was so bizarre that we are still in wonderment about the nature of what was observed.  I do not expect to ever figure that one out.  Whatever it was, it just should not have been there. Was it flying?  Well, yes, incredibly smoothly and close to the street.  The thing showed no pitch, yaw, or roll, whatsoever.  It would not be so troubling had we not seen it so very clearly, in good lighting from our headlights and the street lamp.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I refuse to believe that the thing was a government spy drone of any type, because I doubt we have technology that sophisticated, or even a spy drone that is disc shaped and only six inches in diameter.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I later parked the car in the street and adjusted the position of a white six-inch  ruler laid on the street until it was the same observational elevation above the edge of my car&#39;s hood as the bi-convex disc had been, and the six-inch ruler looked the same angular width as the disc when at 15 feet from the car.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We express our gratitude to Ray Stanford, a noted UFO investigator, for submitting this report.

She then came running up the step call my name since I was also up watching a movie on cable as she ran to the back door to see what it really was, but when she got there the light had vanished. A few days went by before I decide to check the security monitor tape to see what exactly what she saw and I was surprise and amaze to find what the security cameral had catch.<n> <n><n> <n><n> First I thought if might have been a police helicopter even thought that night either my wife nor myself had heard one, but to be on the safe side I call the Columbus City Police and they gave me the helicopter division and I was told that all helicopter had not flown since about 4 that morning. Second thing came to mind was maybe it could have been an aircraft since we did live not to far from the airport. So I call the air traffic control towers and they told me that there were not air traffic at that time on morning and it did not start up until about 15 to 30 minute after the stated time. This left me with now what cause the light that came straight down out of the sky that make no noise what so ever and dance at the foot of my step. I have watched this tape footage for over a year trying to find so possible way that someone could have do this. From someone standing on my root to someone in a tree with a spot light, but for light to bend the way it did left me just a puzzle as it did when the first time I saw it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I finally decide to file this official report that I have a video tape of some strange light from an unknown source in the sky shining and dancing on the ground at the base of my back step as if it was looking for something.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have waited for it to happen again but to my knowledge this was the first and only time it happen other than when my two oldest teenage kid had said when they was small that they saw some color lights shining in their bedroom window which is on the same side of the house as the back step and the window was on the side of the house and back steps was on the corner as the window.<n> <n><n> <n><n> If you have any idea what the light are please let me know. I don’t know if the light had any color to it because it was taken by a cameral that take picture on the gray scale.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I still have the Video tape of that night<n>

I first noticed a bright white object out over the ocean while I was outside at approx 230 am. It was a very bright light, with a huge ora around it and looked out of place compared to the other stars out. So I watched it for a while and all of a sudden it dimmed out into nothing, then it slowly got brighter and brighter, all while not moving in the sky. I ran inside to get my friends because by this time I didnt know what it was. So they came out and watched it with me for 2 hours. In this time the object pulsated out over the ocean. But it didnt just go back and forth from light to dark, it was irratic because it would dim, then come back half way, then go out for a minute, and then go back to bright. A few times, it changed to a redish color. Distance wise, it was clearly out over the ocean, maybe 2 miles or more. After watching for a while, I remembered my father had his video camera inside. So I got it and brought it out. When I zoomed in on the object, I first thought it was the moon, because it was a sphere and had dark areas all over it. Unfortunatly the battery died after a few seconds, but I did get a small amount of footage. After watching for abount 2 hours, the object dimmed out and vanished. We stayed for another half hour to see if it reappeared, but it did not. I don&#39;t know what we saw, but it was not a star, a plane, flare, or light house. Anybody else who say this please file reports to varify its authenticity.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We suspect the witnesses may have been looking at the star, &#34;Sirius,&#34; in the northeast sky.

He saw the object a bit before me, and pointed it out. It looked like a dim point of light and moved like a satellite at first, so that&#39;s what we assumed it was, until it accelerated dramatically. It then took off in a different direction at the same speed. It switched direction several times, sometimes turning at angles of 90 degrees or smaller. After about a minute, we lost track of it- it seemed to just disappear. Either it turned off its light or it ascended higher than we could see.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was a small sphere of fiercly strobing light. It was flashing red, blue, green, and yellow lights at very rapid intervals, and was &#34;dancing&#34; around a focal point.

From there, all four of us were viewing it with binoculars and confirmed that it looked similar to a floating soccerball with different colors of light flashing in a pattern.  We all confirmed the &#34;energetic dancing,&#34; and the awesome red,blue, green, and yellow super strobe lights.  We all stared at it for 56 min., and at 12:59 it disappeared behind the tree-line.  After almost an hour 4 people could not come up with a ligical explanation for what was being seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We suspect the witnesses may have been looking at the star, &#34;Sirius,&#34; in the northeast sky.

It&#39;s the real deal (I never thought Id write that) at least, its something Ive never seen before. His wife and kids were all with him at the time and they got really upset/scared. He said they flashed the car lights at it and it flew straight at them. After a couple of hours of hovering about he followed it as it started to leave towards the pow-wow grounds and (he lives about 1 mile out of our small town) it zoomed straight up and disappeared. His wife Mary Rose got really upset at him because he had the video cam in one hand and a sword in the other (dont ask me)...She was hollering at him to get outta the field but he has it all on a dvd now. He told me about this 2 nights ago and he has showed several people already.<n> <n><n> <n><n> He asked me to try to contact someboday regarding this to get out there. I have no idea who to contact, or write? He is interested in selling it to real tv or the like. the local stations in Bismarck say they are not interested but they want him to bring it in to view asap.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Th|8/24/04|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/038/S38645.html|404|ndxe200408| At Midnight, both my husband an I were outside gazing at stars when we noticed a large triangular object with a pattern of 5 lights. The lights were very dim, whitish-gray in color and likely would not be noticed other than the fact that we both asked if the other saw them. We heard no sound and saw only the one object. It was not translucent as it clearly blocked the stars above as it traveled across the sky.It traveled North to south until we lost sight of it 10-15 seconds after we spotted it. It’s motion was stealth like and seemed to float.   I also noticed an unusually large number of falling stars throughout the evening approx 15 over a couple of hours. Whether this is related I do not know but thought it’s worth mentioning.  I have attached a picture to better illustrate our sighting. To offer some credibility of myself, I have been in the finance industry for over 10 years, manager of many staff and offices. I am now the mother of a 3 month old son who I devote my days to.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

We were amazed at the number of satellites &amp; shooting stars evident in the clear night sky and observed for a period of time.  Because we were focusing on the sky above our property facing south we (my wife and I) noticed a large peculiar triangular shaped object slowly moving southward towards Calgary fly right overtop of us.  What I initially thought was why are we not hearing any sound from such a large low flying object.As mentioned and better appreciated from my sketch of the object it was very large and if I could relate it to something it would be large enough to fill a football stadium.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There were 5 disctint lights within the triangle and were very dimly lit with a light low enough that if we were not looking at the exact right spot we would not have even noticed it even based on it&#39;s size.  It blended very well with the clear and dark night sky so well that if it had just been myself witnessing it I would have written it off as my eyes playing with me but thankfully my wife witnessed it as well.  We know it is strange and even tried to see if it blocked out stars above it to confirm an object and sure enough we could not see the stars directly above it. Simply it sent chills thru both of us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with this witness via telephone, and he sounded quite sober-minded and credible to us.  PD))<n>

I work the &#34;graveyard shift&#34; at my work which is on Fort Sill, OK. I was talking to my best friend on my cell. As I got in the car, he asked me if I could see the odd lights in the sky from where I was in my front yard. I live out in the country, so I had to drive down my little road a ways to get past the trees. I looked over the western portion of the sky and saw two bright white lights and a smaller pulsating one that changed color. It was moving very, very slowly. At first I thought it was a military plane going from Altus AFB, OK to Fort Sill, OK as they are wont to do from time to time. But, you can hear those planes for miles and they usually fly in 3&#39;s. This object made no sound that I could hear. I was 1 mile off the main highway and I can assure you, it was dead still outside. I pulled over in the drive of a cow field and watched it. It moved like it was hovering over something. The two white lights would get dim and then insanely bright for no reason. The object got closer to me as I watched it. I could make out a triangle-type outline to it and noticed it had 3 white circular lights on each &#34;point&#34; of the triangle. It seemed to zig-zag in the sky very slowly and would &#34;hover&#34; or stop completely at times. By this time, I was a little scared and told my friend I was going to drive out to where he was so we could watch it together. As I was driving, it sped up some and when I arrived at my destination it had all but disappeared after a sudden burst of speed. It was in one spot and then it was clear across the sky in the next moment. We watched it until it was gone from our sight. The whole sighting lasted 10-15 minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
8/11/04 22:48|Kemet (Turkey)||Diamond|5 seconds|Diamon/shevron/stingray shaped silent object over Kemer, Turkey|9/9/04|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/039/S39161.html|411|ndxe200408| Diamon/shevron/stingray shaped silent object over Kemer, Turkey<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object appeared over the beach of Kemer, Turkey at the Mediterraian Sea at 22:48.  The sky was clear with lots of stars.  The Antalya airport is located within about 50 miles of the site.  There were numerous planes seen in mid air approaching and leaving the airport mostly in SE/NW direction. None of the planes approached the beach where we were located.   The object, however flew directly over us and disappeared behind our hotel.  It flew from SE to NW, over the sea and then over land, where its view was obstructed by buildings.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Description:  Its shape is hard to define: it looked like a diamond or a stingray while somewhat flat at the front.  At some point it seemed to be made of soft fabric and its sides seemed to slowly move up or down, as if slowly changing shape.  The bottom part had numerous lights that were much dimmer than the stars in the sky.  I would estimate the size as that of or larger than Boeing 747.  But with the shape closer to B2 bomber it had to be quite big.  No wings, however.  Can&#39;t say if it was a single object or a formation - did not have a chance to see it long enough.  Speed: approximately 250 mph.  Height: I estimate 900 feet.  Again these are only estimates but if this were a 747 or 777 it would be possibe to see detail of the fuselage, windows, side marks etc at this height.  The object made no sound at all, or at least anything that could be heard above the noise of the surf.  It did not occur to me to report it to local autorities.  My family and I saw the object very clearly, however, if not for my daughter, I would have never noticed it.<n>

It would move very slow then very rapidly and it would hover from time to time. My friend came over to my apartment and we watched it for the last couple of seconds that it was in the sky, because by the time she got there, it shot off in the sky. This WAS NOT a plane as it was not shaped like one. I couldn&#39;t make out what shape it was, but it was not a plane shape guaranteed. It had 2 or 3 lights on it that went around it in kind of a circular motion. It kind of went in a Z pattern in the sky hovering for a couple of seconds at each turn point.  As if shot off, it went southeast into the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I watched the area for three or four minutes, but the star never reappeared.  I have no explantion for what I observed.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

At first I thought maybe it was some sort of military aircraft but it made no noise and did not have any lights on it. It appeared to be flying about anywhere from 50-150 mph and was probably about 1,000-2,000 feet up in the air. The aircraft was black and outlined in a thin haze of gray. It was a fairly large aircraft, larger than a 747. I have never seen anything like it and do not know of any aircraft, particularly something that large that doesn&#39;t any noise. I saw it for about less than a minute until I lost sight of it. That night the sky was clear.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was accompanied by 3 blinking red lights which we decided were jets because we could hear their engines. The jets did not stay in any formation with it but moved around craft. When it was directly overhead we realized that it was a triangle shape.  After it reached a certain point South West of us it apparently turned (trees were in our way) and began to head in a West to East direction. At that time we lost sight of it.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

At first glance we both tried to quickly dismiss the object as a small plane (due to a small local airport near by) but soon realized that this was not the case. Being that the object was very low and flying in what seemed to be in a very fluid almost hovering type motion we soon realized that what we were witnessing was not a plane but indeed a UFO.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The whole time we were in view I was trying to dismiss the whole UFO thought and tried my hardest to prove to my self that this was a plane or at least a helicopter. The more I looked the more clear it came to me that this was definitely not any man made object. There were no wings, no rear tail section and there was clearly no rudder.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We continued to follow the object but our visibility was obstructed by trees but just as soon as we thought we had lost sight I saw it one more time and then it was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Wow what an experience.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((name and e-address deleted))<n>

It was probably at 1000 foot elevation and moving steadily in an eastwardly direction (toward the river) at a speed that must have been 60mph or more.  I watched it as it moved away from my position.  Then, after about 4 or 5 minutes, it went into a vertical climb at the same rate of speed.  I continued to watch for about one more minute until it disapeared into the cloud cover.  It made no noise and was not a recognizable craft.  It had no wings, lights, landing gear or propellers.  My closest explanation is that it was a 20 or 30 foot wide black balloon that travels at 60mph.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At the risk of straining my credibility, I believe I saw this same object (or one very similar) three days prior, from my residence in south city Saint Louis at about 7:30 pm.  This object had the same shape and moved about 60mph in a South/southwestwardly direction.  I did not get as long a look at it before it moved behind some trees.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have never reported a UFO before.  I am almost 32, with a graduate degree and I have never taken drugs.  I am very used to seeing all kinds of aircraft in and around the city.  We have a very busy airport, there are news helicopters, military planes, blimps, and castaway helium balloons from the car dealer next door - and the object I saw did not look (or act) like any of those.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I have seen this myself man|8/11/04|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/038/S38589.html|427|ndxe200408| Peter, I&#39;ve noticed that some reports describe a starlike object that gets incredibly bright and then dims. I have seen this myself many times. The first time I saw this the increase in brightness was so dramatic that I thought I had witnessed an explosion in space! After some research I realized that what I was seeing was an Irridium flare. These are communication satellites that reflect the sunlight back to Earth when their solar panels are at a certain angle. These manmade objects reflect sunlight at night because they are out of the earths shadow. There are websites that will tell you when these objects pass over your area, these sites predict irridium flares accurately. Please don&#39;t think I&#39;m a debunker, I know there is an unexplained phenomenae {ufo&#39;s!} because I have witnessed them myself. But some strange lights in the night sky are known manmade. Just thought I would try to seperate the wheat from the chaff. You are doing a great and necessary thing with this website. Wish you the best.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We are aware of Iridium satellites, and the bright flash of light they give off, when their solar panels catch the Sun at a certain angle, relative to the observer&#39;s location.

8/10/04 23:55|Arlington|TX|Egg|2 minutes|Dark object with glowing green-yellow light seen over Arlington, TX|8/11/04|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/038/S38583.html|428|ndxe200408| Dark object with glowing green-yellow light seen over Arlington, TX<n> <n><n> <n><n> I just saw the weirdest thing I have seen since the big meteor a month or so ago. I live in Arlington in the Mansfield area. At about 11:55pm on August 10th,  me and a friend witnessed an object flying across the sky. It was unlike any aircraft I have ever seen. It was a dark oblong shape(the best I can tell). The large part looked like a shadow almost. It was colorless but slightly darker than the sky. It had a greenish yellow glowing object suspended just beneath the large object. I thought at first that it might be a balloon and glow stick, but the object was traveling against the wind at a steady rapid pace (opposite direction of cloud movement). It made no sound. It looked to be pretty large from what I could see of it. The object traveled from East to West and appeared to be at least 1000&#39; feet up, or more, because it was above the lowest cloud line.  We watched it for a good while, until it disappeared in the distance. I would just like to know if any videotaped it, or if anyone knew what it was. IT WAS FREAKY, BUT VERY COOL.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
8/10/04 22:30|Sacramento|CA|Flash|90 seconds|Blinking star.|8/24/04|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/038/S38599.html|429|ndxe200408| Blinking star.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was in my backyard at 10:30pm. I noticed a blinking light very high up in the Northern sky. It blinked 4 or 5 times while I watched and then stopped blinking. The intervals between blinks was about 3 or 4 seconds. I thought it might be a plane at first (planes and helicopters are always flying above where I live). I was thinking that maybe the blinking was actually a plane headlight and the light was bouncing back from some thick clouds or smog which would give me the illusion that it was a blinking light. But the light never moved the whole time I watched and it was completely quiet and clear outside. No sound of a plane at all. It stayed in the original point I first found it in the entire time. When it stopped blinking I couldn&#39;t help but stare intently at the location it had been in. I stared for what was probably 20 seconds at that exact spot. Then, from exactly that point in the sky, I saw the largest, brightest most colorful shooting stars I have ever seen. The trail covered 1/3 of the sky as it shot past and the head of this thing was bright reddish colored and the red color appeared to be lining the sides of the outer edge of the front of the trail. It was stunning. I admit that this blinking light could have been anything and the shooting star could just be a tremendous coincendence. Personally, I have never witnessed anything quite like it but it would be great to find out what it could have been.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

A few seconds later, when we came to a stop sign and a clearing, I saw the strange-looking thing flying SE to NE not too high up in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was composed of four white lights and two red lights, none of which were flashing, and it was traveling quite fast.  It seems like it would have been triangular in shape with one white light at the forward point, three white lights in a row behind it, and the two red lights at the opposite back corners.  There were no green lights and no &#39;headlights&#39; that we frequently see on aircraft landing at this time of night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At arm&#39;s length, it was about the size of the end joint of my thumb (about one inch).  A pure guess about altitude would be about 1,000 feet.  It seemed really close, to me, closer than aircraft usually fly.  I certainly would love to know what it was.  If you&#39;d like, I&#39;ll mail a drawing.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

While west of Baghdad, Iraq.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was stationed about 30 miles west of Baghdad, Iraq in 2004.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At about 0355 on August 10th, 2004 I went outside to cool off due to hot summer night.  I&#39;ve always been interested in aircraft and stars.  I just happened to look overhead when I saw appear a one &#34;winking&#34; light travelling from west to east at a extremely high rate of speed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was 46 years old at this time; I have seen many nighttime objects over my life but nothing at all like this.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It appeared to be travelling several thousand mph.  Very regular, rhythmic white &#34;winking&#34; light approx. 4 times per second.  No breakup or scattering of artifact as with a falling meteor, space junk or satellite.  No sound what so ever. It appeared to be extremely high however I was able to see it travel in a straight line for about a total of 4 seconds while it &#34;winked&#34; to the east.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Fully aware that I was in a active combat zone, this light, however, was vastly (understatement) faster than any combat jet know in! theater.  At this time, I was a navy corpsman assigned with the USMC as well as a RN.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Summary: Very, very fast regular &#34;winking&#34; (approx. 4 x second) distinct white light west to east travel.

It was going straight up, not on a slant like airplanes, and I called all the airports in my area there were no airplanes out at that time. When the UFO was over my house my tvs went crazy then as soon as it was gone they were back to normal. I don&#39;t know if what I saw was real, but I thought I should do this anyway because I really think it was<n>

On this one day not much different from any other we had gone to bed around 10pm and in the middle of the night I had woken up and I saw 2 black humanoid figures in my room. I tried to look at them closely and they seemed to resemble my parents. When I tried making sure they seemed to freeze in place and I was overcome with a horrible fear and felt forced to lay back down and close my eyes. The next day I asked my little brother if he had seen anything and he told me that he thought our parents had been in the room. I then asked both my mother and father if they had been in our room at any time of the night and they both had said that they haven&#39;t been in our room the entire night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I believe what I have witnessed was 2 alien lifeforms and I do not know if they had done anything to me as I slept.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.

8/9/04 23:15|Lake Zurich (sub of Chicago)|IL|Flash|1--2 seconds|A sudden extraordinary occurance in the sky...seeing at near range a ufo...traveling fast, low, horizontal as a ball and streak.|8/11/04|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/038/S38567.html|436|ndxe200408| A sudden extraordinary occurance in the sky...seeing at near range a ufo...traveling fast, low, horizontal as a ball and streak.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I live in Lake Zurich IL about 15-20 miles north of O&#39;Hare Airport.  The area also has several smaller airports.  Given this location there are always planes in the sky...of varying size, propulsion, direction, height, color etc.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have a Lab (dog) and walk him 4 times a day.  Our last walk of the day is between 10 PM and 12 PM.  While the dog takes himself for a walk, typically I check out the night sky...stars, falling/shooting stars, low flying and high flying planes.  I claim no particular knowledge or skill,  in making observations of atmospheric or man made airial objects.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At about (I wasn&#39;t wearing a watch) 11:15PM...I was standing still just doing what I normally do...checking the position of the Big Dipper...noticing some distant moving lights in the sky, which always turn out to be aircraft lights.  The sky was clear...visability very good. Having set the background, I was totally relaxed, and just observing the sky when a bright white light flashed across the sky in front of me.  There was, by my judgment, a white...ball...that left a streak.  It took that object one maybe two seconds to pass through my field of vision.  I had no time to turn my head..my eyes seemed to pick up a moving light not much before it was just to the right of the direction I was looking.  My eyes just followed the white ball/streak till trees cut off my line of sight.  I just stood there, amazed, thinking (and still thinking)- what the hell did I see? And there was no sound that I could hear.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Here are descriptive facts as my mind recorded them:<n> <n><n> <n><n> 1)  This ball and streak was traveling HORIZONTAL to the ground, moving north to south (direction of O Hare Airport), at a speed that I (former accountant) calculate very crudely (I&#39;m just trying to get a ball park idea of speed)...at a speed of 18,000 mph.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 2)   Now the following is very difficult, because obviously I was not at all prepared for a special observation, and its longevity was very,very brief. I tried to guess at the height and distance it was from me.  Again, I am very familiar with aircraft flying at various altitudes and distances.  Nevertheless,this observation was difficult to nail down.  The altitude was low...and I  am perfectly aware of spacial illusions...and because of the size of the object and speed...all making me question each of my own conclusions.  I feel the object was surely under 5,000 feet, possibly under 1,000 feet and ...somewhere in that range.  And it did not seem very far away...here, as a very rough guess, I would say it was about 5- 10 miles away...just as a crude guess.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 3)   This bright white ball ( as near as I can tell) left a streak or tail that went back about 2-3 miles...but of course, if I&#39;m off in height and distance then my sense of distance for this streak would be distorted.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In summary, this occurance was like seeing a shooting star, traveling low and horizontally, at an incredible speed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((ADDENDUM REPORT FROM SAME WITNESS))<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is a supplemental report and inquiry.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In my report filed yesterday 8/10/04 I failed to state the size of the UFO.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My guesstimate would be -  about 10 feet.  Otherwise in reading case histories on this site I was shocked to note that many cases  involved circumstances much like I experienced.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have a few questions:<n> <n><n> <n><n> 1)  For a very crude calculation of speed (i.e. how fast is &#34;fast&#34;?) I made a simple (and I know it&#39;s simple, really). Using my best judgment I estimated the distance that I saw the UFO cover at 5 miles (I had trees to my left and right...so my field of vison was narrowed). My estimate of duration was one to two seconds (and though it was a blink) it could have even been three seconds...but lets go with one second. So for this calculation the object was going 5 miles a second, then multiplying 5 miles times 60 seconds...we get 300 miles per minute, which is then multiplied by 60 minutes to the hour...and we&#39;re up to 18,000 mph.  Remember, this is a crude calculation (strictly to determine a &#34;ball park guess&#34;.  Now, if my sight duration was 2 seconds that would cut the guesstimated speed to 9,000 mph...3 seconds would bring the speed down to 6,000 mph.  This calculation alone is not enough.  If we had several such calculations, we might be able to draw some fairly good conclusions.  But by this conclusion I &#34;m pretty confident this object was going many times the speed of todays aircraft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 2)   After filing my initial form on this site, I called the FAA.  The man I spoke to was responsible for taking UFO sightings.  He was nice enough, but he questioned me like I was an pilot returning from a mission.  After all, I had a 1 -2 second experience that happened because I was casually looking at a small piece of the night sky.  Again, he was nice but he had edge of skepticism that I tolerated (after all under similar circumstances I might act the same ).  Toward the end of the conversation he asked if I ever saw a meteor?   I have seen many  a shooting star or falling star and I might have seen a meteor shower years ago.  I said that I don&#39;t think it was a meteor...and besides this object was going at a fast, constant speed, horizontally - parallel to the ground.  His answer was...just as you can point a gun in any direction...a meteor can go in any direction (...???).  I said I didn&#39;t know that.  At this moment I don&#39;t believe that bit of information...I&#39;ll check it out.  Before ending the call, he was nice enough to tell me there was a sighting a half hour earlier in California.  And it was  possible one object could have been in both places that night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 3)  Again, taking crude and possible numbers...30 minutes into 2100 miles equals 70 miles per minute...times 60 minutes...and that says  on a direct flight from LA to Chicago in 30 minutes the object was going 4,200 mph. Of course, the object might have gone to several places only to end up in Chicago.  If that were the case the calculation would be wrong and the speed much faster.  Anyway, based on what we have we know there is a possibility the object is doing it&#39;s traveling over the US at a speed of ...between 4, 200 mph and 6,000 mph (or 9,000 mph, or 18,000 mph).<n> <n><n> <n><n> 4) FINALLY,  as already explained in the original submission, I&#39;m within the O&#39;Hare radar reach...is it possible to inquire of the FAA if the O&#39;Hare radar picked up a UFO on Monday night around 11:15pm?  And if they would...would they tell the truth?  Would an object streaking at a fantastic speed even show up...and if it did would they conclude it was just a &#34;bug&#34;?

I am very familiar with the fact that to our west is the Gila Bend Gunnery Range and that often at night they launch flares that are suspended in the air for about 3-5 minutes, at different elevations.  They burn a golden glow until they burn out then just seem to disappear.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What I saw was not this.  What I viewed was due south.  I have seen it twice now, the first time was about a month ago.  Both times it was above Table Top mountain, which is about 4200 feet tall.  I would first see one light, then very quickly would see 2 or 3 others light up, then they would blink on and off.  At one point their were 7 lights. The lights were very stable and did not move, they just blinked on and off. They did not stay lit like the gunnery lights,(gunnery lights flare when they light up, stay a consistant brightness, then totally burn out...they don&#39;t keep lighting up over and over, again.) These lights  would go on and off, almost in some kind of a sequence.  Both times I watched the lights for the total time they were dancing about.  Then they would just stop.  Tonight I stood outside and just kept watching.  About 10 minutes later the lights all blinked one more time and then there was nothing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In the direction I was facing, due south, I really don&#39;t believe there is anything there that can be doing this.  I drove out that way, the last time,  to see if maybe there was a tower put up on the mountain or something (this is a very rural area) and there is nothing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I don&#39;t have a clue what I saw.  I just know that for where the lights were...there is nothing there that would make those lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

About 70 east of Nashville.) There was a very bright light directly in front of our house, southwest sky. I nor my husband paid much attention to it at first. My husband says it got brighter and this is when he first started noticing it. I didn&#39;t start noticing it until it started moving. It had sat still for 10-15 minutes and I thought it was a star. Although there were no other stars in the sky at the time, I didn&#39;t think anything about it. It started slowly moving upward. We watched with passing interest although it was much brighter than planes or stars. My husband said he saw it blinking, I never did. It continued upward, then went very quickly to the west (right). We got up from our chairs and walked to the edge of our porch to get a closer look. It quickly started going upwards again and then VANISHED! We both were freaking out! It wouldn&#39;t have been such a big deal but for such a bright light to vanish was a shock to our senses. No idea what we saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I work for a large corporation located in midtown KC. I am making this report on behalf of two of my coworkers. At approximately 10:30 on the morning of August 9, 2004, one of my coworkers, who sits by a large window on the north side of our building, saw two clusters of white dots traveling from west to east at an altitude of between eight to twelve thousand feet and at a distance of about two to three miles. He called to the coworker who sits next to him and together they watched these objects fly out of sight. The objects in both clusters appeared as white, round dots. The first cluster contained about five objects and the second cluster contained four objects. The first cluster was at a slightly higher elevation than the second. The objects in both clusters maintained a tight formation. Because of this, and the speed of the objects, neither witness felt that the objects were balloons. In fact, they had no idea what the objects were. Both witnesses are college educated. The weather at the time was clear with a few scattered clouds and no discernible wind. One of the reasons that I&#39;m posting this sighting is that it seems to be remarkably similar to a sighting that took place in Joplin, Missouri in the early evening of July 31st.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The objects appeared to be either directly over the Cascade Range or to the east of the Cascade Range. These three objects were cigar-shaped and hovered in a straight line, side by side like three dashes, and remained in that position for several minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I did not detect any movement from the objects, and I asked two other paralegals to come look. None of us had a camera or camcorder. We located a pair of binoculars and I was the first to look.  I observed that the objects were gray/silver metallic in nature and I think that I am correct in saying that they were reflecting the sun, and thus appeared bright.  The object on the far right moved upwards slightly, and as it moved in those one or two seconds, it did not gleam.  I suspect it was at such an angle as to not reflect the sunlight.  As it took its new position slightly above and diagonally to the right of the others, a fourth gleaming object came out from behind the object on the far left, and lined up with the other objects.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It looked similar to these dashes:    _ _ _ -  I asked the paralegal with me if she had just seen what had happened.  She said, &#34;Do you mean that the one on the right blinked and a fourth one came out on the left?&#34;  She took a turn looking with the binoculars. The objects just held the same position.  By now, it was approximately 8:25 a.m.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Although none of us were able to continually watch (I, for one, had a noon filing to prepare for the court), one paralegal and I were able to see these objects in their same pattern until at least 8:40.  With the sun changing position, the reflection disappeared, and it was difficult to see the objects anymore.  I cannot say exactly when the objects were no longer there.  By 9 a.m., I could not find them.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I was in Sacramento.  It was about 5 degrees north of Venus, about 2 degrees lower to the horizon and about 4 times as bright.  I watched it for about 10 minutes to see if it might be an airplane, but it didn&#39;t move.  Then, at one point I looked away for about half a second and looked back and it was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Last night, at about 04:00, my girlfriend called me from Placerville and asked it I saw a similar object.  I was in Sacramento and driving west at the time and didn&#39;t but then turned around and it was there again, in the same place as the night before.  While we were talking, it just blinked out, and nothing.  This one was also for about 10 minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We are way out (50 miles) from any airport and this light was so far away, it appeared to be a star, just very bright.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Are you aware of any similar reports?<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We presume the witness means a date of August 09, 2004, and we have amended the date above.

A small flash of light caught my eye in the sky between my trees and the neighboring apartment roof.  I looked at the lights about seven in all as it moved just a few degrees off south.  The lights were white in color, and in a V pattern.  I stood up because the lights were moving very fast, and I was going to loose sight of it.  My first thought was that it is a very fast airplane, but I couldn’t hear any noise, just that of the city.  I couldn’t tell how far away the lights were or how big the object was.  As I watch trying to think what I was looking at, it moved straight to the west (right) without any wing tip or signal.  It was as if it was going forward then just moved to the right without stopping.  I just said what the hell, still trying to make something out of what I was seeing.  The lights then began going out as if the object had some thickness.  The problem with this I couldn’t see the object.  This I can explain, after all it was very dark and if the object were black I wouldn’t be able to see it in the dark sky.  This incident only took a few seconds and the object moved very fast.  My only explanation would be a B2 bomber with landing lights on; I just can’t explain the turn.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thank you ((name deleted)).<n> <n><n> <n><n> I already filed this report earlier today.  I forgot to say that when the object turned it continued to head south.  It just jumped to the right.  Sorry for not being more careful.<n>

One of us &#34;knew&#34; to look at the sky, and saw a light that appeared to track across the sky simmilar to a sattelite.  However, it was not moving at first.  After we paid attention to it, it began to shift.  First in a straight line, then beginning to slowly arc, gain speed, and then flashed and dissipeared into a dark spot in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We speculated that it as the light of a sattelite solar pannel reflecting from the sun.  Dismissing its arc and suddden dissapearence untill a second (from a different part of the sky) began tracking to the same spot where the light had dissapeared.  Multiple other lights were seen behaving the same way eccelerating and dissapearing into the same dark spot in the sky.  It was at this moment we realized that the sark spot in the sky was the Dark Rift of the Milky Way.  the lights notibly the first one was &#34;hiding inside a constilation&#34; in the place of a star only it was a different radience than the others. this location is adjacent to Shilo, a military training area that was recently training soldiers abroad{example, hunderds of Germen troops} I find it not irregular to see lights in the sky especially outside the city&#39;s light pollution, however SENSING to look at one portion of the sky, get others attention and then after all people focus at this spot it began to MOVE.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Our experince was unique but was also part of a UFO flap in the winnipeg area during the WEEK of reports Aug 8-15.

The very odd thing about it was they stayed in a perfect formation and when observing it moving in a southwesternly direction(against the wind) the formation it self seemed to be solid as it went past stars (you can make out in the city) it eclipsed them. It moved slowely the entire time. A co-worker and myself both watched it move out of sight behind some trees. This was in Midtown Memphis so I&#39;m sure more than myself and co-worker say it. Hopefully someone else saw this eith on Radar or visually. It had to be at least 50 yards in length and width<n>

8/8/04 15:30|Fargo|ND|Cigar|1 second|Large, bright silvery object moving very rapidly inside chemtrail.|8/11/04|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/038/S38536.html|460|ndxe200408| Large, bright silvery object moving very rapidly inside chemtrail.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On the afternoon of the date noted above, I was helping my neighbor repair his backyard fence which had been downed by a windstorm. It was a beautiful Sunday afternoon, with bright blue skies and a few of those puffy marshmallow-type clouds so typical of summer in these parts. I was using my body weight to brace an upright from behind, while my neighbor drilled screws into the fence sections from the other side, and had my head turned to the left facing west. I noticed a persistent contrail (a &#34;chemtrail&#34;) was being laid in the western sky, coming in my direction, so I kept my eyes on it, as I had nothing better to do and realized in short order that this particular chemtrail was rather unusual: it was what researchers into this phenemonon refer to as an &#34;intermittent&#34; chemtrail - in other words it was not a single long contrail but rather was broken up into many shorter pieces almost like a morse code in the skies...dot, space, dot, space, dash, space, dot, space, dash, space, dash, etc. - obviously *not* an ordinary contrail. The plane itself was quite difficult to see immediately in front of its trail, and for some reason seemed to be most visible in the intervening open spaces. I finally lost the plane and leading edge of the trail behind some nearby buildings in the backyard, but the intermittent chemtrail itself was very cohesive and retained its shape so I kept watching it to see if another plane would come over the horizon. I had in mind to compare a follow-up contrail to the first. After watching for 2 or 3 minutes, I was stunned to see a very large and bright silvery object shoot through an open space in the original chemtrail path, in other words from one side of the trail, through an open space, to the next section of the chemtrail. Whatever this thing was, it was obviously following the trajectory of the chemtrail perfectly. I was unable to see any wings on this craft nor was I able to hear any sounds from it, but it obviously was metallic as inferred by the very bright silvery flash it made when out in the open and reflecting the sun. The entire sighting actually lasted less than one second, and if I hadn&#39;t been lucky enough to be looking in precisely the right spot I never would have seen it. By the way, I referred to my sighting as &#34;cigar-shaped&#34; but that impression may have been due simply to the speed of the sighting...this event happened so quickly that it&#39;s possible I suppose, that the object could have been almost *any* geometrical shape.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((ADDENDUM FROM WITNESS))<n> <n><n> <n><n> Mr. Davenport, this is a correction and an addendum to my original report filed recently, from Fargo, ND. The correct date of my sighting was Sunday, 8 August, 2004, and not the 6th as I&#39;d originally entered.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My sighting as I&#39;ve stated happened very very quickly, but after running or looping it over and over again through the camera of my mind, I came up with a few more details: I actually saw the craft twice. The first time was a very bright flash, which alerted me to focus my attention on that small area of the sky. This was obviously a result of the bright sun reflecting off of the surface of this bright silvery craft and also occured in a gap of the chemtrail, but more distant. A very brief interval later, the craft came shooting out the end of another break in the chemtrail in plain sight but moving very fast. For some reason the dark band running from the front to the back of the craft that I mentioned in my original report, has now resolved itself in my mind to be a row of very dark windows which also reflected the sunlight, and the shape of the craft seems nearer an ovoid or large circlular shape rather than cigar-shaped. Also and for what it&#39;s worth, it almost seems as if the craft STOPPED for the briefest of intervals, the instant it breeched the chemtrail and then continued on its way, but this may only be my mind trying to explain to itself something highly anamolous.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((END ADDENDUM))<n>

My first thought was a child&#39;s mylar balloon.  The problem was that it travelled against the wind, went very fast and travelled in a perfectly straight line.  It was below the clouds because it was silhouetted against them when it passed by.  When it was against the blue sky it was still visible, but not as clearly as when it was passing in front and under a cloud.  It did not change shape or make any noise.  It appeared solid and metallic.  I called it to the attention of my two boys (age 10 and 8) but they failed to spot it before it went out of sight.

I know that today there is some performance of some aircraft, so I got up to see if that was some aircraft. But to my surprise I noticed that it was not moving in a straight like and also saw that it didn&#39;t have a shape ... it was circular. It didn&#39;t leave any trail like the jet aircraft do. It was very high up in the sky. It&#39;s path was something like a graph ... couldn&#39;t be possible for any aircraft. Then I thought it could be a bird. But I closely observed it and found no wings or shape. That&#39;s when I started thinking ... Wow ... is that an UFO? I think it is.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was at 40 degrees elevation on the east side. It was moving North for a while and then it changed direction towards East. Since there are a lot of long trees in my neighborhood, I couldn&#39;t see it after a minute when it went further east.

I did see the common air craft activities to the north over the river/delta.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Looking through the window, I noticed a very bright light high up in the south eastern sky, much larger and brighter than any star or planet. You can imagine my surprise upon finding our binoculars and looking through them, what I saw off in the distance was 5 lights in a horizontal plane very close to one another, totally stationery. I got my wife out of bed. By the time she came to the kitchen, which was only a few mins, it had moved further away and at a slightly different angle, making it impossible to see it as 5 lights. Rather, by this time it was just one bright light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I called 911 and 3 policemen came to the house. They saw the light in the sky, which I photographed by the time they arrived. Again, it had moved further away but was still clearly visible. They had never seen anything like it and made out a report. They got me your tel number in Seattle for reporting UFO&#39;s.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We suspect Venus.  PD))<n>

We were working on my computer there, so I had to connect it and get online when I got home. That&#39;s why it has been two and a half hours ago now.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My friend lives in Wood River, Illinois and I decided to stop for gas in Highland. I took the exit onto Innerstate 70 headed east. I caught sight of this object to my right (south-east) as I reached the speed limit. I rolled down the passenger window to make sure I wasn&#39;t seeing a reflection or distortion in the glass. It looked the same.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object was illuminated in white light although it was somewhat dimmer than the full moon would be. It looked like a round tube standing on it&#39;s edge straight up and down. Like the core of a paper towel roll. Except this one had a ring that circled the entire object. Somewhat similar to the rings of Saturn if seen from beneath. The whole object was as big as a penny held at arm&#39;s length away and hovered 25 to 30 degrees off of the horizon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I drove it seemed to float a little higher and lower in the sky but kept pace. I had my little camera with me so I decided to drive down to the next exit (Pokahontas) and pull off to try to get a picture. If nothing else but to prove something was actually there. I didn&#39;t want to stop on the innerstate on a late Saturday night/Sunday morning.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The problem was it slowly started to fade away and by the time I got to the exit it was gone from view.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had my police scanner with me but no one I heard reported anything. Also I saw plenty of stars around so I don&#39;t think it was cloudy.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After some rest I will attempt to send a drawing of what I saw. Hopefully it will be of help. In the meantime think of the towel core on it&#39;s edge with Saturns rings around it and that&#39;s pretty much it.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

This was the only thunderstorm that we had last year and the threat of fires was high.  Directly west of us is Kootenai Canyon and we were watching a wonderful display of lightning.  I spotted a red glow and assumed a fire had been started from the lightning.  I grabbed my binoculars to get a better look, and as I was observing the red glow, there was a flash of lightning, and then it sunk in that there was a huge red glowing ball above the far ridge, not anywhere near the ground and right in the middle of the incoming storm.  My daughter grabbed the other pair of binoculars and we continued to watch this stationary red ball until it was obliterated by the rain.  After the storm passed the &#34;craft&#34; was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

We were all sitting outside watching the sky because I told my family about the upcoming meteor shower. We noticed a couple of satellites flying by overhead that intrigued everyone. After a while I caught another one flying straight over-head so I pointed it out to the rest of us. We watched it zooming over for a minute when it flashed a light like it was shining a spotlight into our eyes which lasted for a few seconds then went dim again. We all freaked out about it and were talking up a storm about it. My brother who just got out of the Air Force flew satellites in Colorado Springs and was pretty sure that wasn&#39;t a satellite reflecting the sun back to us. It was a very strange event and I thought I should report it. I&#39;m not sure who else has seen this same thing but I&#39;m sure someone else had to of.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was at a fairly high altitude and moving at a speed that would not have been a jet or plane. I was sitting on the backyard swing about 8 p.m. central/standard time Saturday, Aug. 7th, and looked down on the ground for only a couple of seconds to pick up some trash underneath the swing and when I looked back up at the sky in the clearing was this ball of light that had just appeared out of nowhere in a vast clearing in the sky.  It was moving quite swiftly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I live not far from the airport here and I can say with certainty that there were no strobe lights as required by the AFA as well as this being a perfectly shaped ball.  When a plane is at that altitude it simply cannot appear to move as fast as this ball of light was doing.  It was making a straight shot through the sky, had no sound, and left no chemtrails of any kind, nor was it losing any altitude like a meteor particle or falling star would.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It moved across a vast opening in the sky in 30 seconds or less and had this been a plane I would have sat and watched it for several minutes before it made that distance.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is the second sighting I&#39;ve had; the other one was saucer shaped over downtown Jackson, MS, in May.<n>

But every time I looked in that spot, there was nothing there. Finally, I caught another glimpse, and decided to drop the kite to the ground and focus on that spot in the sky. Eventually it became clear that there were three spots of light, no brighter than any night time star. The lowest light was about 45 degrees, with a second light about another 10 degrees directly above the lower. A third, and somewhat smaller light, was slightly higher and to the right of the middle one. These lights did not seem to have any movement to them. I called to my eight year old daughter to look up in the sky and tell me what she saw, and she described what I was looking at. I asked her to run back to a camping area to fetch a pair of binoculars that were left on a picnic table. As I waited for her to return, the lights became more difficult to observe. It seemed that they were quite far off since they were becoming obscured by some haze blowing off of the ocean. Eventually the higher, smaller light faded out, but the lower two were still visible. I noticed an airliner approaching from west to east, and as it neared the area by the lights, they turned a reddish color and appeared to fade much like the smaller light had done. As the airliner left the area of the lights, they reappeared. Another airliner approached, again from the west, and this time the lights reddened and faded, but did not return. By the time my daughter returned, the lights were gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

As I looked I couldn`t see anything, then I noticed a silver oval shaped aircraft overhead of me. The shape was going at quite a speed so i carried on watching for a while at the same time thinking it couldn`t possibly be an aeroplane. The object carried on flying, then suddenly stopped, it hovered for a few seconds then darted very fastly to the left and hovered for a while, then, went right and did the same, then it went back to where it had started and just vanished. It was an extemley clear day with not a cloud in the sky, so the whole incident was very clear to see.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I was taking a lot of pictures of the sea, sand, sky, birds, and so on. After filling up the memory card with a lot of practice shots I took, I went home and transfered all my images. It then happened, where my dad and I notice a white speck at the upper right portion of a shot I took at a bird that was flying over the sea. I zoomed in on the image, and my hair on my body stood up. I don&#39;t know, but it seems to be something. I knew it can&#39;t be a bird because it was a shot that I took at distance, and a bird would not stand out that big from a long distance shot. I knew it couldn&#39;t be dust or something right in front of my camera, because the image is too far. The picture was during the day time, so I don&#39;t think it would have been a star or something. Later on during the day, I went to another venue to practice soccer. In this park, I sat on the bench with my dad, and we were talking about the clouds. It so happend to be, that we saw something white in the sky again. It was day time also. I didn&#39;t get a chance to take a picture of it, because clouds began to cover it up. I don&#39;t know what we saw, but it is very mysterious.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thanks<n>

The others were dim, but would blink whitish, green, lights. There were also two in the sky looking west from my back yard. They are bright with blue, red, and green lights mixed with white. They hovered there for about 1 hour and then dissappeared. There were planes flying around them for a while, I just wondered if maybe they saw them? Or why if they couldn&#39;t.

I could see stars and what I thought was the moon though it seemed odd that this small `moon` had a kind of orange glow around it. I continued to look at it when to my astonishment this shape began to move across the screen in such a way that it was clearly not the moon or a star. For two minutes I watched it as it moved across the screen in an S-shape. Occasionally during this 2 minute period it disappeared from view only to reappear again in a slightly different place. Because of this it could have been possible I was witnessing more than one UFO. I am a 28yo male and this is my first experience of this kind and I am writing this report because there is no rational explanation for what I saw.

I  was just looking over your response (once again) to my photos taken on that August 7, 2004 night again and quite simply I disagree with your opinion/response as to your opinion of the source of these objects!  Please once again, closely examine for example pictures 4 &amp; 5.<n> <n><n> <n><n> By the way my brother was looking through his binoculars while I was taking pictures, and my brother counted 7-9 object that we saw that were continuously changing orientation that evening.<n> <n><n> <n><n> First notice there 5 lights in picture #5 (note you clearly state that the Aerostat aircraft has 3 strobes. Also notice throughout all the pictures that the objects vary dramatically in orientation from each other . . . not what your Aerostat aircraft is even capable of creating those formations of objects with the just 3 strobes onboard.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Next closely examine #7 picture and the objects in that picture  below (zoomed in) …does that look like Aerostat strobes???   The lights formations (that constantly changed formation that evening) throughout the 15 minutes my brother watched them, were at a 12 o’clock position straight up over the top of your Marfa concrete circular landing area that was lit up with your landing area lights that evening. Your Aerostat aircraft is simply not capable of creating the formations of objects in these photos (attached) documenting what my brother and I witnessed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Please respond with what you now think based on this eye witness account and please do not tell me (as you did before in your previous email) “The Aerostat is equipped with three (3) high intensity Aircraft Strobes to warn General Aviation Aircraft in the vicinity, so that is what you most likely saw that morning.”  (Ken) The numbers (of objects) and logic simply “does not compute”.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Next you stated in your email that did not see any other objects or unusual lights around the Aerostat . . . . 1st  were you outside looking straight up at midnight that night?<n> <n><n> <n><n> 2nd there was a strong breeze that evening and even if the Aerostat was launched, you and I know that the Aerostat aircraft would have been down wind hundreds of yards not straight up over head in that strong breeze . . .right?

I have no clue what this was but I am positive it was no plane, and nothing made in the united states...I dont understand how planes or any object of that matter that can hoover in the sky, move in opposite directions, and ive never seen anything so bright...I normally dont believe in things like this thats why I am a little reluctant to tell this story...but its nothing I&#39;ve ever witnessed before...<n> <n><n> <n><n>

We had been gazing at Casseopia, and a light in that direction caught my eye.  A few degrees SW of the &#34;center&#34; of Casseopia, it had not been there moments before.  It was a little brighter than Mars had been at its closest approach to Earth, but white.  Startled to see a &#34;planet&#34; where one shouldn&#39;t be, I observed the light begin to slowly fade after 4 or 5 seconds, making me wonder if I had happened to observe a nova.  I desperately wanted my friend to get back out there!  The light then began to make a slow arc of a few degrees, counter-clockwise, continuing to fade until it stopped moving/faded from view after about 10 seconds.  Maybe terrestrial, but sure looked like a high altitude rocket thrust...any reports of U.S. tests?<n>

She said that what looked like 2 satellites were travelling side by side then the 2 objects stopped and then the changed to a different direction and split apart, then were no longer visible.  The sky is very clear there tonite and she lives in a rural area away from city lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I was traveling East on Interstate 195 from New Bedford,Ma to Marion,Ma,wich is about 10-15 minutes away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I was about 2 1/2 miles from the exit #20 that I would be taking, all of a sudden in the corner of my eye I notice a bright ball shaped light in the sky &amp; immediately got a stange feeling about it!(Looked like it had to be around 400-500 feet up).<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was moving Eastward parallel with the highway,but Inland above the trees, &amp; then in a split second it changes from Ball shaped to Oval shape! Back &amp; forth!!<n> <n><n> <n><n> Now I&#39;m getting really nervous because I dont know what I&#39;m looking at! I know for a fact this was not a blimp or anything like that! This &#34;Thing&#34; wasn&#39;t covered w/ lights, It was a Solid (Yellowish) Glowing Object!(With sharp edges...Not fuzzy!) that was (Literally)changing size at will every few seconds! (Very Strange!)<n> <n><n> <n><n> It must of been atleast 100 feet long when Oval! (We don&#39;t have any aircraft like this!)A Definate UFO Sighting that, I thought would have been seen by many!,<n> <n><n> <n><n> Since there were several cars on the highway at the same time traveling just ahead &amp; behind me!<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was no reports about it on local tv news, newspapers etc.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Never heard anyone mention anything about it...Strange!

(i picked cigar as a shape but it was more like a needle?) i watched it till it was so far my eye couldnt see it any more...i sort of forgot about it.. till i was watching tv and saw some ufo special and they showed video tape of a craft some guy recorded over colorodo, and it looked just like what i saw...oh and a regular airplane flew by and it gave me a better feeling of how high it was....<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

The object did not appear to be making any sound or noise(even though it was quite windy at the time of the sighting) at one point the sun caught the side of the object which made it shine but there where no lights on it.  this object was not a bird,comet, balloon, helicopter, hot air balloon, flare, fire-work, or satelite.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  One of multiple reports from same source, who provides a minimum of contact information.

I was standing on the outside of the Annex Post Office of Sedro Woolley on Eastern and State St., looking straight up at the horizon when I witnessed this encounter.<n>

Then I realized it should have set hours ago.  I looked out the window, overlooking the Atlantic Ocean and saw 12 to 15 golden white lights, all exactly the same distance from each other and exactly the same size, unmoving, as if in a quiet bay.  There was one red light at the western end of the array.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They looked to be about a mile off shore.  I looked away and when I looked back, one or two lights in the center had gone out, the rest were still there, no motion, all exactly spaced.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In the morning I mentioned it to someone who had grown up in the house and was an avid sailor.  He saw it too, said he had never seen anything like it before.  He described it looking like a “flotilla.”   He couldn’t get a sense of how far away it/they were.  We were talking about the lights as if they were fishing boats.<n> <n><n> <n><n> No talk about UFO’s, I didn’t think of it until I was half way into Connecticut and I remembered the light that woke me up.  I can’t communicate with the fellow who also saw it until next week when he returns to dry land.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke via telephone with the source of the report, and she estimated the time she awoke at 03:45 hrs..

At Avenida Cabelleros, I looked ahead and saw a round craft with pulsing white lights around the perimeter, about treetop level above the street about four blocks ahead of me.  I noticed that there were no other cars on Ramon at that time.  I became afraid, and I quickly turned into the Ramon Park, went inside my house and woke my husband up, and we both went outside and watched the object in the sky further east and higher up now.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

Facing north, I am north and close to the landing pattern of Reno International. I was watching as an airliner was taking off and noticed out of the corner of my eye, a small white dot. I thought it was moving, but thought also that it could be because of the airplane taking off...they were pretty close. As the plane left sight, I noticed that this little white dot was still moving.  As I watched it heading south (in my direction), this little non blinking light lit up into this huge red light.  As it still was heading south, this red light split into two red lights...and from the second red light, it split again...totaling 3 red lights. These lights did not twinkle or have any glare. As I watched and called for everyone to come out to see...these 3 red lights split again becoming 6. Each one of the 6 had red and white lights moving in a circular pattern...and not always consistant. We all (5 adults, one child) watched as these lights cruised around the valley and I noticed that my neighbor was outside and went over and I showed them to her and watched them with her for about 5 minutes. Heading west to Slide mountain area, then south, then east, Virginia City area and Fallon area. At one point there was a HUGE red glow over my neighbors house. We couldn&#39;t tell how large or how high it was because the house hid part of it. As I went to go get my camera...it disappered.  From across the street, what we could see was approximatley as wide as a chimney would be.  So it makes me wonder how big it really was.  My husband was watching it through a small telescope and said it wasn&#39;t just one large light, but many lights.....and big! He could see the lights and a slight outline of the craft.  We continued to watch the others going all over the sky. I was trying to take a picture, but was having a difficult time trying to focus on any of the lights.  Out of the six frames I took, I did manage to get one with the red glow.  The show/event lasted for approximatley 1 1/2 to 2 hours. The last ones that we seen were heading east.  For the next two days, we also had seen other objects in the sky...mostly in the daylight.  The main one was the following day about 13:00.  Looking south, I was watching a grocery bag that was floating across the sky and as I watched it, something behind it caught my eye.  At first I thought it was one of those high flying planes, but it did not move...it was stationary.  The color was non-reflective and about the same color as a nickle...more dark gray than glowing silver, longated or cigar shape. I watched it for approx 5 min, then went to grab the binoculars and turned around...and it was gone.  Busy skies!<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous.  Some of the lights described seem to us to be not inconsistent with advertising lights.  PD))<n>

I live on the eastern edge of Reno, along the Virginia mountain range. A few commercial planes in the sky, as I&#39;m about two miles east of Reno Tahoe Intl Airport.<n> <n><n> <n><n> But coming from the northwest was a strange thing. Two reddish blinking lights seemingly connected, but at a distance that would fit maybe four commercial planes between them. No sound, either with or following the pair of lights. I *think* I could make out dim stars between the lights, but I&#39;m not sure.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It covered the sky at a lazy speed. (One commercial jet was at about 7,000 feet moving in for the landing loop they do from the south, and the jet was moving faster. Reno is at 4,500 feet elevation.)  This was a weird one. I guess it could&#39;ve been some sort of military jets flying at very high altitude in perfect time with each other, but if so I&#39;ve never seen such jets before. (We&#39;ve got a big Naval Air base about an hour away, and every now and then we see/hear a fighter jet over Reno.)  I watched it for the second half of the walk around our very long rural block, and stood outside my house watching as it disappeared over the Virginia range.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It appeared to be *huge.* And, to clarify the direction in case anybody else saw this thing, it went from the northwest to the southeast. (Not a satellite -- we have a pretty clear sky here and enjoy watching the space station when it comes over our part of the world, especially in the summer when my family is out on the deck.) A pair of blinking aircraft-style lights, but very erratic in the flashing. I held my hand up and the distance between the lights was about four fingers wide.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;m very interested to hear if anybody else saw this thing. It is still fairly early and lots of people are out for the famous Reno old-car show, Hot August Nights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My dog didn&#39;t care. He was sniffing the garbage cans &amp; such, as tomorrow is garbage day. I&#39;m sorry I didn&#39;t get a picture. It wouldn&#39;t have been much of a picture from our cheapo digital camera, but anyway it was headed over the mountains as I got back to the house.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;ve seen one thing previously that might have been a &#34;UFO.&#34; That was about three-and-a-half years ago with my wife, driving up the 395 between L.A. and Tahoe. And that was one of those very low-flying &#34;triangle&#34; things, which we figured was some sort of test plane flying from one of the many air bases in the Mojave. But it was still exciting to see it.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

We pulled out of our driveway and onto the main road travelling south.  We were the only car on the road at that time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We had only traveled about a quarter mile when I spotted a stationary bright light above a ridge to the east.  I quickly pointed it out to my roomate and he suggested we we take a road leading up to the top of the ridge.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We drove rather slowly trying to make sense of what we were seeing.  The light was very bright hovering just above the treetops to the right side of the road.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We got extremely close to the object which was now almost directly overhead when all of a sudden two more bright lights on the craft were illuminated.   We could now see that the craft was triangular in shape with lights at the three points.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When the two lights were turned on the craft began slowly rotating in a clockwise motion and then moving slowly away from us.  It realized that we were following it.  We continued observing the object which was now travelling at about the same speed as us at about 30 m.p.h.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We followed the craft for another minute or so when all of a sudden it zoomed away from us faster than I&#39;ver ever seen anything move.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The craft was metallic, dark grey in color and completely silent.  My roomate and I got a very good clear look at this thing which was, without a doubt, somekind of aircraft equipped with technology far more advanced than any commercial or military aircraft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My roomate and I to this day remain puzzled yet intrigued by what we saw in the sky that night.

We turned to look where he pointed,and we all saw the two objects,we confirmed with each other that yes,we saw these things.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They looked like two cylinder shaped objects,that were either white or silver gray color,and were moving nearly alongside each other at what appeared to be a normal speed. Whatever they were,they were moving almost next to each other at a pace where it was not hard to see them. After a minute or so,one looked like it was slowly gaining altitude and also started moving Southeast,while the other one kept going straight South. We could see no windows,etc. on the sides of it,as if it were an airplane,and no wings,just two cylindrical shaped objects next to each other moving at a normal pace through the sky.We have never seen any flying object that looked like this before,and we joked that U.F.O&#39;s are watching people and giving tours to see what humans do in their free time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My friend told me the next day that he tried calling the local college and the local airport to find out if there were any weather balloons,etc in the sky the night before,and he was told no,also he said he had called local Police or Sheriff&#39;s and tried his best to explain what we all had seen,but they kind of chuckled at what he was trying to describe to them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> (I don&#39;t know exactly what he told them,but it must have seemed funny to them.)  I cannot remember exactly what day this was that we saw these objects, but I remember it was in early August of this year.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Now just within this past week or so, on or around October 3rd or 4th,2004 my friend and I saw what appeared to be the same type of object in the sky. This was just about a week ago. We were coming out of a local store and putting our items in the car trunk when he said to me &#34;Look! There&#39;s that funny looking thing again!&#34; He pointed towards the East in the sky,and it did look like the same type of object we had seen in August. This time we only saw one,and it was traveling across the sky at a normal pace where it could easily be seen by anyone who was looking in that direction. It went from East to Southeast until it faded from view into the distance. We kind of joked about it and went on about our business.<n>

A place I climb frequently. There, covering 1/3 of place we call rock garden, that is, blocking out 1/3 of it was avery large,bright,white,shimmering, circular shaped object. By scale, aproximately 4-500 ft. in circumferance. It moved north to south at a very slow rate of speed. By the time we exited, went under the over-pass, and looked up again, it had moved approx. 5-600 yds. to the south. This was way too big to be any conventional aircraft, moved way too slow, and was too close to the peak. which was a great reference for me to scale the craft, since I had climbed there often. My friend also saw it briefly and took great interest. He later found there to be 4 other similar sightings in a 30 mile radius....that day. 1st report, 2nd sighting<n>

I dismissed it somewht because there had been thunderstorms overnight.  As the noise grew nearer, I tried to get up and couldn&#39;t at first. I was conscious, but couldn&#39;t get up. Finally, I went to the window and looked outside but couln&#39;t see anything--clouds overhead. But, I still could hear a lound, oscillating, roaring noise hovering very near. By now my husband was awake and he heard it too.  We live near an airforce base and a public airport so I hear planes traversing regularly. Could this be a plane? If so, when did they start to hover?<n>

8/5/04 00:15|Lawrence|KS|Chevron|~2 minutes|Isosceles triangle shaped craft, seemingly hovering, and then disappearing.|8/11/04|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/038/S38479.html|506|ndxe200408| Isosceles triangle shaped craft, seemingly hovering, and then disappearing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was driving due east on 15th Street and had just crossed Kasold Street when I noticed a low flying object. I am not a good judge of aerial distances, but maybe 1000 feet in the air. It seemed likely that the object was an airplane at first, because it bore the blinking red, white, and blue lights typical of airplanes.  However, after a few blocks the object was nearly directly over me, and it definitely had the shape of an isosceles triangle with the short side not much shorter than the two even-length sides. Two aspects of this sighting made it strange. First, the object was barely moving. Although I was driving, I had slowed way down to maybe 5mph and it seemed to be hovering. Becuase the car was on, I cannot say whether it was making any noise, though I heard none over my engine. Second, after driving by the object about 5 blocks, I turned the car around to look at it again. It still seemed to be hovering, so I reached under my seat to grab my binoculars. When I looked up, it was gone. I didn&#39;t see it zip away or blink out. It simply was no longer visible. There were some high clouds, but definitely higher in altitude than the object. Of course, turning off its lights would have been sufficient to hide it from my sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I guess I&#39;m not an unbiased reporter, since I frequently scan the sky in the hope of seeing something. However, in ~ten years of sky watching, this is the first sighting I&#39;ve felt compelled to report.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was after midnight is all i can remember and i had just stepped outside the front door of the office building when i saw this circular craft almost about tree top leve fly almost over my head in front of me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It had a big circular white light under the craft which glowed very slowly blinking on and off sort of like a christmas light would.  The UFO was crusing along very slowly and as it got over me i could hear a like a whisper of a humming noise.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then as it went by i stepped out further to take a look at it as it went by and the thing looked like it saw me and went behind some trees to fly off in a direction it didn&#39;t want me to see. I  felt like the craft was trying to avoid me seeing which direction it was heading because i already had seen it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Anyhow i never reported it because i didn&#39;t think i would have my job very long if the company thougt i was a kook.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So years later i wished i had always written downt the time and day but i tried to just forget what i saw. I heard you comment on 55 wkrc radio a few weeks ago and you said if people saw something they should report it because you said you wondered how many people never reported seeing a UFO.  This is all i wanted to say.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))<n>

Some distant lights caught my eye. Though far away the lights were quite bright. Unlike aircraft they were moving about independently, up and down and at angles, and in circular motions. There appeared to be 3 white lights which would fade to a blueish color [also independently] around a reddish,orange center light. Since I was the only one to see it I kept it to myself. However the next morning I heard on the radio that others had seen similar lights very early that next morning in what would&#39;ve been the same basic area. [I94/I275] The radio station was 104.3 FM and if memory serves there also a brief mention on the TV news, channel 2. At the end they seemed to come together into a single bright light and took off at a high rate of speed and dissappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

When exploring the power line the next day the area where we saw the object, all of the grass had been singed, and black in color. The area that was singed was aproximently 30 yards/aproximently 13 days after the sighting there where strange looking hellicopters with different types of rods sticking out flying over the area about 10 feet above the treetops, I have photos of the singed grass and strange looking black and red hellicopters, that were unmarked. Also the light bulbs explode in our basement.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Then I noticed from far away an object coming towards me from the north (i think); it was far away so i thought to myself &#34;hm that plane looks like a UFO, but the closer it was coming the more obvious it became to me that it was UFO! It never hit the clouds, so i can say its size was smaller then the passenger airplanes (more than twice), it was flying approximately twice the speed of the planes (constant speed), but i didn&#39;t have any means to capture the image. It appeared to me as a silver shining ball, very vivid. This is first time in my life I&#39;ve seen a ufo during the day time and that vivid. I&#39;ve seen them at night many years ago, but this was something.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I called my 2 older sons and we all stood there and watched it for an hour. It was very bright white and had rays of light that flashed every now and then. But it was very far in the sky and hard to see anything definite. Around 5:00 the sun began to rise and the stars in the sky were fading away, but this stayed bright. After this we went to bed and didn&#39;t see how it left.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then this month (September) on or about the 5th, I woke up at 4:54 (I checked the clock) to the same light shinging from the same place. Again I called my son but everyone was asleep. I watched it for about 10 minutes. It had all the same characteristics as the first one. Fog started rolling in and I went to lie down. When I looked it was gone, even though some of the stars were still faintly shining. Then last night, September 7th, at 1:52, I woke to this light again. I called all three of my children this time. My 16 year old went onto the balcony with his binoculars to look at it. He said that it looked like lights were pulsating around it. Both lengthwise and widthwise and he said it looked octagonal, but I think it&#39;s too far away to judge. Once again we went to bed and didn&#39;t get a chance to see how it leaves.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Venus??  PD))<n>

I thought this was strange because it seemed to be hovering and it was too late to be a commericial airline. I went outside and the ufo was heading in my direction. It was VERY, VERY QUICK and glided through the air, and it was quite low. The ufo was blinking red and blue lights and had a yellowish aurora of light around it. It was making a very loud humming sound as it made its way north. The shape of the object could best be described as a cone with a hexagonic/octagon type shaped top of silver color. It was a very errie sight, unlike anything I have ever seen in my life.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I drew my mothers attention to the object wene suddenly the lights magnitude increased magnificently,it then dimmed to its original brightness then dissapeared behind a very small cloud.  We expected it to appear almost imediatly from the otherside but it did not, we waited a little longer still it was no were to be seen.  If that wasnt strange enough, as I searched the sky almost directly overhead a very dark fuzzy boomerang shaped object caught my vision I again drew my mothers attention to it. We had to kind of squint to make it out.This only lasted for a few seconds as it flew very swiftly with absolutly no sound over my parents house.  It took me approximatly 2 seconds to run to the front of the house but it had completly vanished! The event left me feeling spooked what ever it was it did not want to be seen.

It passed by extremely fast and disappeared behind what looked like it should have been a cloud, but there were none out that evening.  The sky was clear and full of stars.  The size was relative to a full moon.  The moon was not out that evening.  I did not hear any sound with seeing the object. About ten minutes later, I saw a shooting star and in comparison, this did not even come close.  This traveled horizontally and extremely smooth and fast, whereas the shooting star dipped and fell. I have never seen anything in the sky like this before. It was definitely too fast to be an airplane and the neon-blue/lights as well as fact that it disappeared made me frightened at first, but then curious so I sat there for another half an hour hoping to see something else.  Nothing.  I have been doing all kinds of research since I returned home and I am interested in knowing if anyone has seen an object resembling the one I have seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thank you for your time, ((name deleted))<n>

The sun caught them at an angle that I could see them for about 5 seconds, and as they headed into clear blue skies I lost sight of them.  The stealth appeared to be flying at aprox 300mph,  the spherical objects were very much higher, I would guess 20,000 feet maybe and travelling 5 to 6 times faster (visually across the sky) than the stealth.

It then reappeared on the other side of the cloud to our left, hovered, then disappeared from sight.

This writer spent about 20 minutes debriefing the witness as he CONTINUED to observe this episode, which he said he had been watching for some 10 or so minutes before calling.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The witness is a 20 YOA male citizen of Stockbridge Georgia. While it is impossible to fully vet a witness without some form of in-depth investigation, during the conversation and questions, he seemed to be a sober minded and observant individual. He was in amazement while describing his observations to this investigator, indicating he&#39;d never watched anything in the sky that performed in the manner he was witnessing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> WITNESS ACCOUNT---- On Tuesday, 3Aug04 at 5:16AM, this writer was reviewing reports previously filed to GUFOG when the UFO reporting phone rang.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The above described witness immediately explained that he had been outside of their Stockbridge home and observed an unusual LARGER than star-like light off in the distance toward the City of McDonough (Stockbridge is about 13 miles SE of Hartsfield Airport.....McDonough is about 8.7 miles SSE of Stockbridge).<n> <n><n> <n><n> This light was also described as being about the size of a BB held at arm&#39;s length, definitely circular in shape, being about 1/4 of the way off of the horizon, and changing from glowing blue to yellow. Said light had been observed to move slowly, then DART up and to the right, then up and down, back and forth, moving about the width/length of witness&#39; hand held at arm&#39;s length. The light reportedly passed behind a tree limb at one time. Witness was frustrated because he did not have a videocam or binoculars. Not knowing the exact distance to McDonough, the witness guessed the light might be about 2 miles away, and when asked, said definitely in the direction of McDonough (which is 8.7 miles SSE). The witness stated he was familiar with the various commercial air traffic all around the Hartsfield vicinity, but this was not similar to that. As the witness watched, he stated that the light seemed to change into a boomerang or V shape.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At that point, this writer decided to ring off and move to a location outside where a view toward that event location is possible. My location in Fayetteville is about 17 miles due west of McDonough. Efforts were made to observe in that direction with 7X50 and then 10X50 binoculars.......with negative results. There are some large trees obstructing part of that view toward McDonough.<n> <n><n> <n><n> WEATHER----Temperature 73 degree, little or no wind, predominantly clear, with some thin dissipating patches of Altocumulus directly over Fayetteville, but clear skies in the direction of McDonough and Stockbridge.<n> <n><n> <n><n> INVESTIGATOR COMMENTS--- Distant lights in the vicinity of a major international airport are often mistaken for something anomalous. (Hartsfield, generally about 13 and 20 miles to the NW from locations described). Additionally, weather conditions, optical illusion w/celestial bodies, as well as the natural eye phenomenon called &#34;autokinesis&#34; might also readily contribute to such an assumption.<n> <n><n> <n><n> (A subsequent phone call to the witness&#39; residence on 9Aug04 found him to be at work. A short conversation with a family member seemed to indicate that the witness took some form of scoffing from his family for reporting his observations).<n> <n><n> <n><n> This FI feels that the Stockbridge report, while NOT of the unmistakable &#34;up close and personal&#34; variety, needs documentation for several reasons, to wit;   1) The above described witness seemed sure of what he was observing, and described it in real time to this FI. PLUS there appeared to be sufficient CLEARLY OBSERVED and RADICAL movement, to include shape changing of the light, to PROBABLY preclude any tricks of the eye or other illusion in the clear mild weather;   2) Additionally noticed by this FI were recent reports to NUFORC by Georgia witnesses...... these events being similar in nature to the aforementioned Stockbridge/McDonough case; (19July04 Atlanta-Sphere; 20July04 Lagrange-Unknown {Multiple Lights}; 23July04 Atlanta-Sphere).<n> <n><n> <n><n> 3) ODDLY ENOUGH, upon taking the initial call from the Stockbridge witness, this FI had been reviewing newly received written accounts from MULTIPLE witnesses that observed an ALMOST EXACT event on 10July04 in the vicinity of Cherry Log Georgia. Said group of witnesses were in a REMOTE mountainous part of Georgia. HOWEVER.....subsequent to the aerial portion of this mountain experience, their episode concluded with an encounter with an UNKNOWN GROUND BASED GLOW and STRANGE ODOR near the position of said witnesses. This Cherry Log Georgia case remains under investigation as GUFOG looks at the possibility of natural &#34;night orbs&#34;, spook lights etc., and local military operations, in an effort to identify the culprit. (Certain areas of this mountain region are used by the U.S. Army Ranger School for training purposes). If the causation in Cherry Log remains unknown to the point of indicating a suspected anomaly, the case will also be posted to the NUFORC data base upon completion of the investigation.<n> <n><n> <n><n> CONCLUSION-----Any Georgia residents in the vicinity of Stockbridge/McDonough, or any other location, that might have information regarding these events, please contact this investigator at 678-817-4555 or at; &lt;&lt;&lt;georgiaUFOgroup@webtv.net&gt;&gt;&gt;   Please note that GUFOG, a small group composed of scientifically oriented active and retired Georgia law enforcement officers, WILL KEEP THE IDENTITY OF ALL WITNESSES COMPLETELY CONFIDENTIAL, per the group&#39;s SOPs.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Tom Sheets, Director-Georgia UFO Group--Office-678-817-4555&lt;&lt;&lt;georgiaUFOgroup@webtv.net&gt;&gt;&gt;<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We express our gratitude to Tom Sheets for sharing the report with NUFORC.

8/3/04 03:33|Tempe|AZ|Light|more than 30 minutes|bright light in eastern sky above treeline (Venus??)|8/11/04|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/038/S38453.html|524|ndxe200408| bright light in eastern sky above treeline<n> <n><n> <n><n> Early this morning (3:33 exactly) I witnessed a very bright light in the sky. I was looking out of a window in our house which looks out onto the eastern/south-eastern portion of sky, because I had noticed an unusually bright light in the sky through the blinds. My first thought was that it was an airplane heading in our direction, as we do experience airplanes and helicopters flying over and over this section of sky on a frequent basis, but this light did not seem to move from it&#39;s position at all. I would say it was similar to seeing Venus at it&#39;s brightest from our home in Colorado recently, only in the East, instead of the West, and much brighter and definitely bigger. It was just above the line of trees which grow a couple of houses away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I know the exact time, because I was awakened out of a peaceful sleep by a very loud, sudden impact noise (like the sound of a stomp on the roof, or a big door slamming closed) and immediately heard a low-flying airplane approaching, it zoomed directly past our southern facing bedroom window, low enough that I could see it&#39;s lights, going from the west to the east. I looked at the clock and it read 3:33. this is when I went into the ajoining room, sat down in a chair at our computer, and witnessed the light through the window. I was up for little more than a half-hour, all the while keeping a loose eye on this light, which in all this time, never moved from it&#39;s position. Just before going back to bed, I looked out of the eastern-facing window once more, and noticed for the first time that the light was flashing, or twinkling somewhat like a star would do, but this object was much larger than any star I&#39;ve ever seen in the sky! In fact, I have never seen anything like this before at all. Around 4:00 I retucked the kids into bed, and went to my own bedroom. Out of curiosity, before lying down myself, I looked out the southern-facing window of our bedroom, to see if I could spot this light, and I just barely could. It was as bright as ever, and still seemed to be in the same position. I have no clue as to how long it had been there before I saw it, or how long it stayed after I went to bed, but I did not sleep well after that.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This morning, it was all I could think about, so I immediately got online, and have searched for a couple hours for anything showing the star/planet configuration for last night and today, with no luck. finally I decided to come here, and see if anyone else has reported seeing anything similar. I am sure others must have seen the same object. Perhaps it was something easily explained. My ear will be glued to Coast to Coast tonight, though, in the hopes of hearing someone else&#39;s report.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We suspect that the object the witnesses were looking may have been Venus.

It was a blue light of a flash which I thought were fireworks that never popped. The blue flash seemed to appear rising up in the sky for a split second and then peeled out into hyper space like the millinium falcon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I know i was not the only witness since I was driving on the freeway about a mile from the Harbor Blvd. exit in West Sacramento along with two freight trucks and at least a half dozen cars within a mile radius. But I would be a fool to call this occurence extra-terrestrial. Maybe some government is testing nuclear missiles, I&#39;m not sure but something happened on August 3rd, Tuesday at about 2 am near the Harbor Blvd exit in West Sacramento, Ca. I need a second opinion.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Siting on the sea wall we are faceing  south. The glowing bell shape thing came from the hills behind the town to our west and traveling east at a moderate speed. At first it seemed to look like large yellow to orange light from the back of a plane but they did not blink and the object kept climbing much higher than a plane would, in fact we thought maybe it was a launch of a sattelite but it stayed in the atmosphere until it looked like a small star in the distance for quite some time, then it travelled onto the horizon until we could no longer see it.  The whole sighting was approximately 20 - 25 minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The color stayed a reddish orange shade while it was in the distance.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

A small plane that was flying north to south had caught my girlfriend&#39;s eye. As the plane passed she asked &#34;what is that white thing?&#34; When I looked up I saw what I first thought to be a white pelican. But on further observation the white object appeared to not have the black wing tips of a pelican and was not moving. I ran into the house and got my 20X50 binoculars for further investigan. I was back outside within 15 seconds and could no longer spot it with my eyes. She had kept her focus on it and pointed out the area it was in. When it was first spotted it was aprox. 75 deg. above the eastern horizon. The sky was clear and the setting sun was to our backs. When I arrived back it was now aprox. 60 deg. up and still towards the east. With the binoculars I now saw what appeared to be three brightly colored lights in a close, touching, triangle formation. The lights appeared to be one bright red, one bright orange and one faded white in color. The three seemed to rotate around the center point of the triangle formation. The rotation would cycle clockwise only to the point where the bottom left light would rotate into the top lights position then counter-clockwise back again. The top and right bottom lights would follow all together, top to bottom right and bottom right to bottom left position then back again. After aprox. 5-6 minutes the object could no longer be seen without the aid of the binoculars. I continued watching the object until it slowly disappeared at about 8:15PM. The object when it was last seen was aprox. 40 degs. up in the eastern sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In talking with my girlfriend she stated that when she first saw it, it was behind the small plane and about half the size of that plane.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We are regular sky watchers who enjoy bird watching during the day and &#34;space junk&#34; watching at night. This is something we had never seen before, but will forever remember.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I rode my bicycle over to his house. I left to come home, he lives about five minutes from me. I was riding my bike home when I looked up at the sky. There a saw a silverish oval shaped object just floating in the sky. Some trees came up when I turned the corner. I looked up and saw the object still floating. For a minute I thought it was an airplane. But as soon as I got to my house it took off faster than I have ever seen anything go before. The object also turned from sliverish to white. My house is about 100 yrds from the corner which i talked about above. the whole thing lasted about 20-30 secounds.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Object moved in a rapid zig zag motion and flashing white and red lights very rapidly and also duplicated colored lights before changing colors again.  Red and White lights would alternately flash and then flash white a few times and then red a few times, it would then start alternating back to red and white again.  It made a turn in an arc (half moon) to direct south.  I lost contact for about one minute when it went behind a building but I viewed it again over the Willamette River when object soon disappeared.  Object was approximately 1000-1500 feet in air and smaller than a dime in size.  Displayed 2 colors and viewed for apporoximately 3 minutes.  The object had no audible sound before its approach or after its passing.  No other aircraft in viewing range.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

There is an airport nearby, but the only thing that could rise straight up and then over like that is a helicopter.

I and my Daughter and sister traveled to my home town Wrangell, over the July 30th-Aug 10th duration. On the very first nite that we walked out on their deck my sister in law saw a bright white ball flying over her house towards the back, and she said look look there is one right now. we all looked and sure enough there was a huge bright white ball shaped ufo flying over her house, it went from about  middle of the sky, east, almost making it to the town. then we spotted two light green seafoam green small diamond shaped ufos that traveled in honeycomb circles, then slowly in half circles, then east to west very fast. They kept this formation all nite, sometimes moving extremly fast, sometimes moving slowly, then we saw over 20 , not all at once, but one at a time, ufos , they would just appear at one end ot the sky and travel to the other, and at one point dissapear in a spot of sky that had no stars in it that we could see. It was just a black part of sky. then my sister in law and my daughter and I were standing on her deck at about 3 am in the morning and a very large blazing white circle appeared out of no where , right in  front of us about 100 yards away. It appeared just out of nowwhere and it traveled from east to west. It was perfectly circular, it flew extremely in a straight line. then it stopped and dissapeared after flying about 300 yards , it just dissapeard . we heard nothing, only saw. I would like to know if anyone else in Wrangell has ever seen these ufos?? We cannot be the only people in Wrangell to see these?? And, if anyone else has seen them why no one ever talks about them??<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>
8/2/04|Southwest U. S.||||Simple passive Radar|8/11/04|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/038/S38455.html|534|ndxe200408| Simple passive Radar<n> <n><n> <n><n> Sir: With respect to &#34;passive&#34; RADAR, it is possible to assemble an extremely simple system to check out reasonably near reflections. I have done this in the past with good results. All one needs is a TV set disconnected from its cable input. A simple three or four element TV beam, hand held, is connected to the TV set.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Now, it is simple to show that light travels at very close to one foot per nanosecond. The horizontal scan rate of the TV is 15750 per second. This corresponds to 65 microseconds or 65000 nanoseconds. So 65000/5280 = 12.3 miles across the screen. If a duplicate image image of the TV program is seen and is moving, such as an aircraft it will be reflected and changing. I have used this and have seen secondary reflections from stationary watertowers and it is quite accurate.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Good luck,  ((name deleted))  (elect engr)<n>
8/1/04 22:30|London (UK/England)||Triangle|30 seconds|Three orange triangles appear, perform aeronautically impossible manoeuvres, then flying off at great speed.|9/29/04|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/039/S39445.html|535|ndxe200408| Three orange triangles appear, perform aeronautically impossible manoeuvres, then flying off at great speed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I live in South London, England, and was greatly surprised to read the account of a sighting on July 29th, in Chelsea, just up the road from MY stamping-ground, Brixton.My experience occurred the following night.The whole weekend of July 30th had been very hot, and the Saturday night was no exception. Taking advantage of this, my wife and I decided to take a late evening stroll. This would have taken place between, I guess, 10.30 - 11.30pm - although,unfortunately,I wasn&#39;t wearing a watch at the time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We left the house in Brixton, and finished up in a small park nearby on the Brixton/Stockwell border. Lying on the grass, looking up at the stars, my wife, ((name deleted)) started asking the names of some of the things we were looking at.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Many years ago, I had a fleeting interest in Astronomy, and enough of this remains to be able to identify things like the Pole Star, and a few of the planets, so I gamely dived in, doing my best.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had made a couple of convincing astronomical stabs, when I noticed what I took to be a flight of birds, very high above us. They were obviously white, because they were reflecting the lights of the city, magnified by the pollution of the last few hot days.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I wondered aloud  what sort of bird could fly so high at night, and what it would use for navigation.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As we continued watching, the &#39;blobs&#39; suddenly resolved into three tiny objects (I could have fitted all of them on my thumbnail) like big triangles with a smaller tail behind.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They flew in a diamond formation for a few seconds, and then one of them broke ranks and moved to a position diagonally opposite the other two. This movement was really extraordinary; I have never seen any aircraft perform it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object moved across the sky extremely quickly, and in an absolutely straight line, as if being pulled on a wire.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A moment later, the other two UFOs joined the first, and flew on for another few seconds, followed by two pairs of wildly curious eyes on the ground.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As we looked, the three objects then flew straight into each other to form a ball, then split apart again, flying off in different directions. Finally a third one streaked straight up, away from the other two, in a crazy &#39;stunt-flying&#39; manoeuvre, flipping and twisting, as if showing off to the others. We lost the first two UFOs at this point, and after its aerobatic performance, the third object seemed to slide off into some low cloud or mist, and we lost that one too. The whole experience lasted no more than thirty to thirty five seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am forty-two years old and work as a videotape editor, my wife is a forty-year-old TV production manager, we are both extremely qualified professionals in an industry that positively encourages cynicism and suspicion. We are not given to flights of fancy, and certainly did not wish for a close encounter of the first kind on a late-night walk round Brixton.However, we are utterly unable to explain what we DID see. It certainly wasn&#39;t no weather balloon, tho&#39;!  As an afterthought, I must mention one last thing, if only as a foil to the unidentified aircraft&#39; enthusiasts among us. Thirty seconds after this extraordinary display, a REAL plane went by, and I thought it lumbered across the sky like an airborne steam-train after the extraordinary aerial ballet we had just witnessed. I noticed that even though the plane was flying comparatively low, there was no reflection from the streetlights whatsoever. Judging by the size of my UFOs, they were tens of thousands feet higher than that plane, yet they were lit with an orange light that I misinterpreted as streetlight - this can only mean that they had their OWN light source, i.e. they were glowing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> How many glowing planes have YOU ever seen?<n>

The sun just set behind the Olympic Mtns., which really gave me a great view. This object was omitting a long firey green tail. It either burned up and or disappeared over Lake Washington, in the east Seattle/north Renton area. My guess is it was a meteorite???<n>

The first photo clearly shows the UFO with a blue sky background. It has a shape which closely resembles the starship enterprise from star trek. The second photo was taken approx 1 minute later, showing the UFO at a slightly different angle, showing a definite metallic reflection. A very interesting point to be made here is that given that both photos are approx 1 minute apart, it is not reasonable to say the UFO was travelling at high speed to avoid detection by the human eye. Also, given that I did NOT see this aircraft that day, I have come to the conclusion that it had a &#34;camouflage&#34; of some sort - which was somehow not effective on the flash of a camera, even though it was a disposable camera! Given the photo timing, I&#39;d say it travelled at a fairly low speed, and low altitude as can be seen by the photos. It was pure coincidence that I had taken two photos, as my itent was to capture the greenery of conneticut having stayed there for a month on work purposes. Of course it may be possible that there were two of these UFO&#39;s. I will send the photos by email, and have the negatives if there are any interested parties. This is not a hoax! my email is w_v@optusnet.com.au should anyone wish to enquire.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((FOLLOW-UP CORRESPONDENCE FROM WITNESS))<n> <n><n> <n><n> Hi,<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;ve already submitted an online report, and stated that I would send the pics via email.  These pics are genuine, and I have the negatives with me. The timing difference between the two pictures is about a minute, and were taken in Windsor Locks, Connecticut. I am from Australia and was in the U.S. on a two week work assignment.<n> <n><n> At the time I can say without a doubt I did not see the UFO when taking the pictures,  and I would think something of that strange shape would have caught my attention.  Also note that I only had a disposable camera with me, and was simply taking snaps of the &#34;nice road&#34; and wasting some of the camera snaps. I was not looking through the lens at the time, I was driving and simply held the camera in front of me to take the random shots, (as strange as it may sound!). So, I am sending the two scanned pics, and two other pics which are only of the UFO from the first two pics with a higher<n> <n><n> scanning resolution.<n> <n><n> Looking forward to hearing any thoughts on this…<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((END CORRESPONDENCE))<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We have looked at the four photographs provided by the witness.

The one on the left then moved to a higher altitude approximatly 1-2 mile high and then moved away at such a great speed that it was clear that nothing we ( ordinary mortals ) know of as being made by us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I immediatly made a call to the Sunday Telegraph Newspaper and reported the incident and also tried to ring the Kingsford Smith Airport but was unable to get the number.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have absoleutly no doubt that these objects were controlled by a some sort of intelligence, They were definatly not fire balls or swamp gas , they were objects being controlled by some sort of intellegence.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I went up the road for a better look but when i got there they were gone, but im not entirely convinced that they were ufos. But me and my bro did see 4-5 air-force planes going around the area where they had been.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
8/1/04 06:05|Marietta|GA|Light|10-25 sec|Slow moving bright light that faded out seen before dawn.|8/11/04|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/038/S38432.html|542|ndxe200408| Slow moving bright light that faded out seen before dawn.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was still before dawn and there was a full moon when this sighting occurred. I had gone out on my deck and was enjoying my spa when I notice a light coming from the west going to the east over the tall trees in my back yard. I didn&#39;t actually see this object until it was pretty high in the sky due to the trees. It was going slow, like the speed of a single engine prop plane, and was bright like a planet such as Venus. The jets were going in my spa so I don&#39;t know if it was making a sound or not. What is strange is that it didn&#39;t have any flashing lights like a plane. There is airplane traffic that does come from this direction at about this speed, but as they get closer you can see the nav lights. It looks like it is pretty high up and I am thinking that since it is high up, has no nav lights, and is pretty bright then maybe its a satellite and its being illuminated as it heads toward the sun that is still below the horizon (sunrise is at 6:50). Then it slowly fades at a steady rate until I can no longer see it. It never changed speed or course, was going much too slow to be a meteor, but just dimmed out just before it go directly overhead. There were some high, wispy clouds in the sky, but not enough to obscure this bright of an object and I can see other dim stars in the same area. I looked farther east, over my house, waited for it to reappear in a totally clear area and it never did.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The movement is what caused the object to catch my eye, the object was approximately the same size and brightness of the visible stars in the clear sky. It produced no discernable sound. I watched as the object flew, at a slow and steady rate, and then appeared to vanish, almost as if the light of the aircraft had slowly faded out. The object itself appeared to get smaller. The entire even took approximately 3 seconds. I&#39;ve seen 2 other instances of this type, in the same general area, occuring in the past couple of months. It is possible that these objects are simply sattelites, as I don&#39;t know what satelites look like in orbit, although I&#39;m not sure they fade from view. I know they are not comets or meterorites because, in the two or three instances I&#39;ve seen these objects, they are not streaking through the sky at a fast rate nor do they leave a trail/tail behind them. Additionally, the objects appear to be leaving the atmosphere (&#34;fading&#34;) after a short duration, not entering the atmosphere.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
8/1/04 03:30|Wrightsville Beach|NC|Formation|1.5 hours plus|3-4 objects moving around eachother about 45 degrees over Wrightsville beach (Venus??)|8/11/04|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/038/S38428.html|545|ndxe200408| 3-4 objects moving around eachother about 45 degrees over Wrightsville beach<n> <n><n> <n><n> 3 Objects, about 45 degrees over horizon, sometimes a 4th object joins them (note: I am having a friend enter this into his computer as I am watching and talking to him on my digital phone) Dancing lights in basically a triangle pattern. They move and pulse dimming and/or moving to and away from me. one was white, one bluish-white which is the smallest shifted to red at times, one bright yellow (the largest) shifting to soft yellow-white and fades to more blue but the full moon affects its color changes as if it is reflecting moonlight. This one has a specific shape to it like a 5 pointed star. A 4th one shows up every now and then appears like a tiny red dot that darts forward and away. The triangle pattern seems to rotate around itself mainly clockwise. At 4:50 am they are in more of a line pattern one nearly 90 degrees overhead. For reference, there are thunderheads overhead and rain sprinkles the whole time. The formation of them changes and rotates and has been going on the whole hour and a half at this point. These are bright enough to often show through the thunderheads. At 4:58 am back around 60 degrees up, no longer straight above me. Lights are still here but I am heading back since I am starting to get really rained on. Objects still darting and shifting brightness. Objects seem to be unaffected by the weather and possibly checking out the beach and maybe even noticing me. I am a Christian and having trouble explaining what I am looking at. Are there any aircraft or man made objects that can do these things?<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We suspect the witnesses were looking at Venus.  PD))<n>

I was staring up at the starts as I do frequently. I noticed out of the corner of my right eye, something moving south to north from behind a tree. It looked just like medium bright star but moved steadily across the sky. It was not a passenger jet, it was way too high and had no blinking lights at all and was moving faster than planes at that altitude move. I see heavy air traffic on a regular basis and this didn&#39;t look like any of it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It reminded me of a waterbug gliding on water. I followed it across the sky, I&#39;d say it covered a distance equaling if I held my arms out above my head as far apart as I could.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I thought maybe it was the ISS or something however a few weeks later I saw something even more strange.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was again in my hot tub watching the stars only I was facing north and the objects were moving from east to west. This time they looked the same, like medium bright stars but there were three of them. One obviously running and two that were pursuing the leader. The lead light was not moving in a straight steady line it was maneuvering and the pursuers were reacting. The lead pursuer was probably half the distance between the first and last object. They formed a triangular formation. These objects also reminded me of water bugs. I wondered if the objects may have been fighter jets since there are  plethora of military installations within 100 miles of my home. These craft had no blinking lights either, and they had to be at an extremely high altitude, it seems unlikely that I would be able to see jet afterburners that brightly. I mean these things looked just like starts they were good size, bigger than passenger jets look at night so the fighter jet thing just doesn&#39;t make sense to me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Anyway, I keep watching.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Possible satellites, we suspect.

It was slightly hazing out so they were easy to spot since they were so bright and the haze illumniated them.  Then on saw several helocopters behind them but there was no sound from the helocopters.  I had my binoculars with me so I could clearly identify the helocopters.  At around 3:15 I heard a ring, tone, dog whistle like sound and I looked up and I saw an object moving.  When I spoted it it look like it started to slow down the stop.  It felt sort of like &#34;I see you, see me, see you&#34; - then it just left and kept on moving out of sight.  Then in a half-hour it came back and did it again.  I could see the traffic pattern of the airport near us - these objects were no where near any flight plan I&#39;ve ever see.  If anyone knows what this means, please email me at ((e-mail address deleted)).  And I don&#39;t any clowns asking me what it means.  &#34;I&#39;m in a tree&#34; - serious emails please.  And I told you I still hear that ringing every night, and I get up and know that something is there.  That&#39;s it.  --sincerely ((name deleted))--<n>

It was very large, perhaps the size of a silver dollar at the end of your outstretched arm.  It seemed like it could have been as close as a few miles off, moving south to north.  I could see the flames burning as if it was a small sun, and moving so slow that the long tail of smoke was rising up into the air.  It never varied its height, just moving silently horizontal to the horizon, then just disappeared in an instant, the smoke still left behind.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I noticed some green fireballs in your other data log.  Do you have any idea of what this could have been?<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thanks much, ((name deleted))<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

8/1/04 00:00|Terrell|TX||20 minutes|Saw light outside window and awakened by a gray being stand at foot of bed.|1/5/11|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/079/S79285.html|549|ndxe200408| Saw light outside window and awakened by a gray being stand at foot of bed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was the usual hot August night in a relatively small East Texas town.  For a couple of nights, I had been seeing lights outside my bedroom window and thought it was a helicopter but could not see it.  I lived in an old frame house and the four windows in my bedroom stretched from the ceiling almost to the floor.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The second night I saw the lights I had just gone to bed; it was about 10:30 p.m.  I couldn’t find the helicopter so I went back to bed.  I would say it was probably midnight or later that I was fully awaken by a gray being standing at the foot of my bed.  I was very frightened but could not move.  All I could do was stare into its deep black eyes.  I began thinking the reports were true, really true.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This being’s skin was so gray.  It had the blackest eyes and they were hypnotic.  It must have been about 5 feet tall.  Huge almond shaped eyes.  This being was scanning me.  I could actually feel this thing inside my mind.  It was scanning my mind and my body.  I felt it learning about me from a mental scan.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was frightened so I thought I would just close my eyes for a few seconds.  That is the last I remember.  Anyway I didn’t tell anyone for a while.  When I told my son, who was 21, he became so frightened that he didn’t want to listen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I didn’t tell anyone else for months.  My daughter didn’t believe me.  I have been laughed at and told I was having a dream.  I give up.  I was NOT having a dream.  This thing was real.<n>
