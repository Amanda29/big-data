The other 3 aircraft were behind me, about 10 miles apart.  We were all flying about 20,000 feet.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The radar weapons officer called the cockpit, very excited, and asked if we had seen &#34;something&#34; pass under the aircraft from front to rear?   We hadn&#39;t.   He calculated its speed as &#34;at least two thousand&#34; miles per hour.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were about to dismiss this as a radar glitch when the aircraft behind us called us to ask if we had something pass under our airplane at &#34;several thousand miles per hour&#34;.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then the third and forth airplane called to say they had the same experience.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Several weapons officers were on each aircraft and all were watching their radar screens and all aboard each aircraft saw the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This was in 1957 when there weren&#39;t any aircraft capable of the speeds we saw that night.<n>
