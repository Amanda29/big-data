3/31/14 23:50|Phoenix|AZ|Cross||Bright flickering multi-colored lights surrounded by 4 arms.  ((NUFORC Note:  Possible sighting of Sirius?  PD))|4/4/14|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/108/S108254.html|1|ndxe201403| Bright flickering multi-colored lights surrounded by 4 arms.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object I saw was in the SW sky over Phoenix, AZ, but it could have been very far off, possibly over the Pacific Ocean, even.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object, seen with the naked eye, appears to be simply a flickering multi-colored object.   At first, I thought it to be a plane approaching the airport, or possibly the light from a nova many light-years away, whose light was just now reaching Earth.<n> <n><n> <n><n> But when I looked at it with a pair of binoculars with my arm braced against the patio door to minimize movement and was able to focus on it, I realized it was not moving.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object appeared through the glasses (red lenses for night viewing, no distortion) to consist of a center with 4 arms extending from it, like a cross.  The center was where the flickering colored lights appeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The colors changed rapidly but I was able to discern at least red, blue, green and either yellow or white.  The features of the ‘arms’ appeared to be diamond or asterisk shaped, 4 to an arm.<n>

I regularly spend nights on the roof looking at stars.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have taken astronomy classes and this was nothing that I knew how to describe.  As usuall, planes were crossing the sky every 5 minutes or so.  Very regular.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then, two red lights about the size of a shining star in the night sky began moving across the sky.  Fast, and making sporadic movements that I have only seen performed before by aircrafts.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They appeared near alkade and dubly, and continued there way towards Capella and Perseus where they took and odd turn and flew between the two where they continued into disappearing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> WHAT WAS THAT?<n>

I was entering my bedroom and glanced out the window and saw an odd shaped saucer like aircraft.  There were many lights colored red, white, and orange.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It looked too bright to be an airplane so I jumped in my bed and shut my eyes for a few minutes hoping it would pass because I was frightend.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After around 3 minutes I looked out my window to see if it was gone and it then flew by my window.  I got up and as I went to walk down the stairs another one flew by.<n>
3/31/14 22:40|Apopka|FL|Sphere|30 seconds|Orange orb over the skys of Apopka.|4/4/14|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/108/S108248.html|4|ndxe201403| orange orb over the skys of apopka<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was smoking a cigarette in the back yard while letting my dogs go to the bathroom.  I noticed mt dogs had all stopped running around and were sniffing at the sky , as though they were trying to scent something.  I started looking at the sky through the trees in the direction they were looking and I saw an object moving about as fast as a jet.  It seemed to be a normal occurrence but the color was off, it didn&#39;t have the normal hue of lights a plane or helicopter would have, no red or blue flashing lights, and there wasn&#39;t a tail so it didn&#39;t appear to be a meteor or falling star.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I ran inside my house to grab my phone, I figured the rate of speed it was moving I&#39;d have plenty of time to get some footage.  I couldn&#39;t have been more than 5-10 seconds and I went out my front door for a better angle.  I know my timing was accurate, it had only crossed the back left corner of my back yard, it should have been in view but it seemingly disappeared.  No idea what it could&#39;ve been, but I believe I definitely saw something unusual tonight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As a fire control technician in the navy&#39;s submarine force, I was trained in celestial navigation and had extensive training in identifying aircraft from a distance.  This was no normal aircraft.  Possibly a rocket or missile but again, there was no flame or tail.  Just an orange orb traveling in a straight line across the sky.<n>

The speres had a blueish white glow to them but yet transparant.  It reminded me of orbs that i&#39;ve seen in pictures.  They crossed the sky from Orion to the northeast in about 4 to 6 seconds.  The size of the spheres i would say are as big as Sirus is in the night sky.<n>
3/31/14 21:05|Dayton|OH|Light|3-5 minutes|UFO near Air Force Base.|4/4/14|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/108/S108286.html|7|ndxe201403| UFO near Air Force Base.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On Monday march 31, 2014 in Dayton, Ohio, my wife and I were cooking out in our back yard on a very clear night.  We were both sitting at our table in the back yard when all the sudden a very bright orange light moving very fast with what looked like bluish streaking light coming out of the back of it appeared in plain sight and stopped suddenly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The craft was very close to the ground, I&#39;d say about 500 feet and maybe 5 miles from us.  At first I thought it was a meteor or large shooting star but when it hovered for about three to five minuets I knew I was looking at something out of the ordinary.  We live very close to Wright Patterson Air Force Base so I thought maybe they were doing something like they do, secret, ya know?  But as my wife and I watched it fly away rather slow, I noticed there was no Air traffic in the sky at all.  We took a video of this and watched it twice but, then the video just corrupted itself.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We then noticed Jets taking off from the Air Force Base (two that we seen) as the craft dissipated into the distance going from South West to North.  The Jets we witnessed turned their lights off at what seemed to me to be about 500-1000ft First Jet turned off its lights, then jet #2 did the same.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I called 911 to make a report but they did not take me seriously.  I&#39;ve never believed  in Flying Saucers of believed in UFO sightings but, what my wife and I seen on March 31, 2014, was real.  It was not a fleeting glimpse of something strange.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We seen something very much unexplainable and I think what ever it was, it spooked the Air Force Base by our house!<n>

It then got closer and larger very quickly.  It then stopped again for roughly 5 seconds.  Then the object rose up in the sky and got very small, stopped for a second or two.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was absolutely no sound or flashing lights.  It got very big and slowly dropped down appearing to land a few streets away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I waited for several minutes to see if it was going to re-appear but it did not.  It was very strange looking with an ominous glow.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.  PD))<n>

She went out and I stood there with the door open looking up at the sky, there were a couple commercial airplanes and the only reason I was really watching them was because they were leaving trails behind them, one closer to me than the others.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was focused on the airplane that was closer, it was headed East toward the ocean, (which I live about 10 miles from) when out of  nowhere a grayish flat disk shape craft came from the south and was headed right for the airplane.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I thought at first I was going to witness a mid air collision, but the craft crossed right in front of the commercial airplane and after about 2 or 3 seconds of me trying to see what it was, it simply disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was no trail left by the craft, the commercial airplane kept heading East making a trial behind it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I looked at the clock and saw that it was 7:12pm, so the event took place about 7:11pm.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am hoping the pilots of this commercial airline makes a report to confirm mine.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

I drew my attention to the swing set, because that&#39;s where they nested last time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I looked up, there they were.  Shiny and silver-ish.  There seem to  be three at  first.  They moved in sequential order.  Like a school for fish, going around in circles, followed by in a wave formation?<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then they were gone in a second, a forth showed up out of thin air, then left just as fast.<n> <n><n> <n><n> F.Y.I- there is heavy air traffic in this area as airplanes always come and go.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I lived in this house for 12 yrs and never have I seen anything like that flying around.<n>

My other roommate and I looked up in the sky and couldn&#39;t believe what we were witnessing.  The lights looked like stars light years away moving very quickly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They appeared to be anywhere from 20-50 meters in diameter.  The distance is hard to judge considering the sky was clear of any clouds.  As the lights came closer, it looked like 30-40 lights forming into a large triangular formation.  Some of the lights were grouped together changing colors from bright blue, to green, and back to white.  It looked like a giant stingray was flying overhead.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was at least 10 lights on each side of a giant &#34;V&#34; shape formation.  Much like birds migrating.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About 10 seconds after we spotted the lights, the formation scattered and made and abrupt left turn, now heading South.  The &#34;V&#34; shape formation with 20 lights was flying at a consistent rate of speed.  There was no noise, no trails that we could see.  The other lights were scattering around the formation and weaving around each other very quickly.  It looked as if they were on patrol, flying down the coast of Lake Michigan slowly fading away in the southern sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The most spectacular thing I&#39;ve ever seen in my life, and crazy because we were just talking about strange glowing lights in that direction.<n>

I look out my window to see a bright light in the sky, probably a few hundred feet in the air, flying over my house.  It was completely silent and sort of indescribable.  It flew directly over my house.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I ran to the front of the house to continue watching it.  I watched it for about 15 minutes or so float to the SE.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Now I do live by an airport and I see airplanes all the time at night.  This was coming from a direction that I don&#39;t see planes coming from, it was completely silent, and I could see it much longer in the air than I normally see a plane.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I plane flying in that direction would have been out of sight within minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This was still visible for at least 15 minutes.<n>

I immediately told my girlfriend to come look. We both then ran out to the balcony and watched this extremely bright light with colored pulsating lights on either side of it just floating there silent heading our direction.  We watched  the object for five minutes or so as krept closer, still silent, lights beaming out in front of it getting brighter and closer.I said this things going way to slow to be an airplane.  My girlfriend said I&#39;ve never seen a light like that before.  There where no clouds in the sky just stars.  as the craft got right over head  we could see it was triangle shaped with two windows on the floor  looking into cockpit area.  A Yellowish green light coming from inside , also lit up lines on bottom side of craft.  Lights on all the points.  It was 500 ft up or so and 200 to 300 foot wide.  We could hear a slight hummin! g noise when it was directly overhead, other than that no noise.  It proceeded on a south western heading over my  neighbors house. I&#39;ve seen a lot of airplanes, this was not an airplane.  This thing  defied the laws of physics.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.  PD))<n>

This happened for a minute and a half.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After the horizontal hovering above the trees, the object turned upwards towards the sky and elevated straight into the sky at a slow pace for about 40-50 seconds.  As the object turned upwards to face the sky, it appeared to look like a triangle for a brief moment (this was nighttime, so it was hard to tell), complete with a reddish light towards the back.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I only managed to get one picture of the object. It took me over a minute to get my digital camera set up in my car, and by the time I took the picture, the object was at least 20,000 feet into the mostly cloudy night sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In the picture, the object looked exactly like a circular orange orb with a slight blur on one side because the object continued to do that very subtle back-and-forth hover that it did when it was hovering horizontally/parallel to the trees.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After looking at the picture itself, it’s safe to confirm that it definitely wasn&#39;t a satellite, search and rescue helicopter, jet, plane, Chinese lantern, flare, or any other “logical explanation”.  It was a UFO.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object was intriguing, which led me to pull off to the side of the road on the northbound lane to stare at it and send this report a few days later.  The reason I was in the northbound lane was because that was the direction I was headed in my car.  I rolled my window down, gathered my digital camera and tried to set it up as fast as I could to start taking pictures.  It took me about 60-90 seconds to get my camera out and set it up for nighttime flash.<n>

I observed 3 orange lights, arranged in a triangle formation, travelling East at about 96* on the compass (checked later).<n> <n><n> <n><n> I noticed that there was absolutely no sound emanating from the lights.  It was very quiet outside and no sound could be heard at all.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I ran back into the house and grabbed my phone and was able to capture a few seconds of video.  However they had already travelled to a point that I was only able to capture the trailing light before they disappeared behind houses.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My house is on the flight line for the Air Force base and local airport, but they fly in on about 177* (S) heading and I always hear the props, jets or rotors.  I would estimate the height of the objects at around 2000 feet above the ground, but that would be 100% a guess.<n>

We ended up finding a road (had to cross a stream, I got soaked).<n> <n><n> <n><n> We followed this road left and found a little, tiny house.  Then about a quarter mile up we found the actual house, we saw who must&#39;ve been the owner leave about 5 minutes before we got on the road.  We turned around and we jogged the other direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It wasn&#39;t completely dark yet, but just about.  We saw three orange lights in a triangle formation.  There were some towers out there with lights on them and stars, but this was neither.  It was extremely close to us, maybe 1-200ft away and 50ft into the air.  It wasn&#39;t moving at all and was a hundred or so feet long.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was a hazy body in between the three lights.  Looked like it blended in with the black/purple part of the sky that it was inhabiting.  One light especially would dim and brighten randomly.  It got intensely bright two times.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We took our eyes off of it while we were running and it was gone when we looked again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

We saw a round object flying towards us which was glowing almost red colour.  It was getting close to us very fast so we pulled over and got out of the car to get a better look.  The object stopped for a few seconds almost on top of us for a few seconds and suddenly started flying away in a opposite direction without making a turn around as plane would do. It just stopped and then reversed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We got back in a car and followed it for about a minute.  It started blinking, then stop blinking and then lights went out and it disappeared.  It looked like it was flying up.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Unfortunately we were too shocked to start recording right away, but my wife managed to get a few seconds video wile we were standing next to the car.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was right next to Arcadia Municipal Airport, but we saw planes in the sky at that time also and it clearly wasn&#39;t a plane.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It had no flashing light, was different round-like form and was moving the way planes can&#39;t.

The sky was dark, not raining and from what I could tell – very sparse clouds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I did a scan of the sky.  As I began to turn away from the slider door, something flashed very brightly in the sky.  It was a white light and looked like it blinked red as well.  I figured it was a plane but I keep my binoculars next to the slider door so I grabbed them.  It took me a few moments to find it again.  Once I did, it seemed as though it was not near the same area as I had first sighted it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So I have the binoculars up against the glass for stability and to help from letting light onto the door from the living room.  I am watching and suddenly it/they begin blinking in different areas.  It/they were maybe below the flight path or else it/they were further away–it was hard to tell.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I got excited because I was stationary and it/they were jumping around, it seemed as though there could have been three or else it was one and it was jumping around.  The lights seemed to be very bright white light that really shone a ways, I believe that I seen a blue light at one point.  I went outside (had to have my daughter hold the kitten so that she wouldn’t get outside) to get a better look.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It/them did seem further away but still jumping. I had to go back inside because my daughter yelled at me to come back in because the kitten was going crazy and wanted outside.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The whole sighting lasted about 15 minutes.<n>
3/30/14 14:30|Kings Mountain|NC|Triangle|2 minutes|Black Triangle with Attached Object Moves Slowly Across Sky and then Disappears into clouds.|4/4/14|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/108/S108209.html|34|ndxe201403| Black Triangle with Attached Object Moves Slowly Across Sky and then Disappears into Clouds<n> <n><n> <n><n> My wife and I (we are business marketing writers) were doing some yard work this afternoon around 2:30 PM, when I noticed an odd object that appeared to be drifting, like a balloon, from east to west in the southern sky.  The sky was partly cloudy with good sunshine.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first I thought it was a balloon because it was moving so slowly; but then I realized that it was drifting AGAINST the prevailing west wind.  I pointed it out to my wife, who agreed it looked like a dark-colored balloon.  She went into the house and brought my binoculars for a better look.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Through the binoculars, I saw a distinctly black, triangular object — it looked rather like a bat-kite, which seemed reasonable to me on a gusty day like today, and it would explain the thing moving AGAINST the west wind.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Once I tentatively identified the object as a high-flying kite, I estimated the “kite” was maybe 6 feet wide and 400 feet in altitude, which would not be out of the question for some kite enthusiasts.<n> <n><n> <n><n> However, I then noticed a dark tether hanging straight down from the black triangle attached to something like an angular, light brown box that didn’t look aerodynamic at all.  The box-like object was about one-quarter the size of the black triangle.  This made me question my kite theory.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then, as I was watching it, the whole assembly disappeared into the clouds — I actually watched it go into one of the cumulous clouds that were moving west to east.<n> <n><n> <n><n> That blew me away, because it meant the craft could NOT be a mere 6 feet wide and 400 feet high...it must have been more like 5000 FEET altitude, or more, in order for it to disappear into a cloud.  Which means it had to be a LOT bigger than a kite.<n> <n><n> <n><n> If the thing was actually 5,000 feet in altitude, that’s about 13 times HIGHER than I had estimated, which would mean my estimation of its physical dimensions was way off, also.  It had to be much larger than I estimated.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The craft did not reappear from the clouds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The entire sighting lasted about 2 minutes and only crossed, perhaps, 25 degrees of the sky, very slowly, from east to west.  We were looking due south, probably 45 or 50 degrees above the horizon.<n>

In mid-conversation, the person whom I was with pointed up exclaiming at me to look, whereupon I found myself looking at what I first thought were TWO low-flying objects, both boomerang or triangular shaped, moving in perfect proportion with each other.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The first set of lights being about a dozen in quantity and the second set of lights being only three, flying at a brisk and constant pace through the night sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The other I was with described it as a very “smooth moving” object, to which I agree.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In addition, there was no sound of any kind to go with the moving lights, they moved in utter silence. The lights flew off and out of sight within a maximum of 15 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After the object left sight, me and the other I was with were in sheer bewilderment and attempted to justify what we saw.  As if on cue, a human-operated commercial airplane was flying elsewhere in the sky.  The point I would like to make is that this plane looked entirely different than what we saw, and it appeared to be at a much higher altitude as well.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We both went back inside discussing and drawing what we saw before Google’ing what we just saw.  We then saw multiple reports from other people describing exactly what we saw as far as the shape, speed, and sound of the object.  This is where I decided based on mutual images of the UFO’s that it was most likely ONE flying object with three under lights.  This would explain how the sets of lights were moving in such closeness and perfection with each other.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We also discovered that the night March 30th, has been a significant date in the history of UFO sightings with waves of UFO sightings having occurred in Belgium, U.K., the U.S. and more.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I would also like to add that me and the individual I was with are credible sources, we wrote this report on the exact night (within a half hour) of the sighting, and we had no alcohol or any other substances that could have altered what we saw whatsoever, and we totally agreed with one another about exactly what we had just seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

But when I got back out there the ball shot to the south towards North Little Rock and disappeared in about 2-3 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I live between 2 military bases so I see all kinds of Jets, C130’s, and helicopters flying around my property all the time.  This made no sound and there were no other aircraft in the area all ni! ght.  I have never seen anything this color or shape out here ever; I have lived here for over 10 years.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I’m a medical professional and my wife has 2 college degrees, we are not people that would just make up a story for notoriety.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Actually I didn’t think much of it till I got on the internet and saw that a lot of people have seen the same thing we have seen….<n>

A friend of my son&#39;s had stopped by to see him, however he wasn&#39;t home and his friend and I began talking about U.F.O.&#39;s/aliens.  She brought up the subject out of the blue which is even stranger since I had never met her before until that moment.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I looked up in the sky while we were talking and saw a silver triangle high up in the atmosphere.  I suppose you could say it was the size of a penny considering the distance.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I pointed up toward the sky and said: &#34;What&#39;s that?&#39;  She looked up and said she didn&#39;t know__then this object &#39;faded&#39; out.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Further away from where this object appeared, a jet was passing. I wonder if anyone on this jet saw what we did? Guess this is another mystery we&#39;ll never find the answer to.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The sky was cloudy that day so I don&#39;t know if it just &#39;disappeared&#39;&#39; or if the cloud cover was the reason it faded.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Nevertheless it wasn&#39;t another jet because it was motionless.<n>

They were flying in a V shaped missing man formation.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The craft were moving fairly fast in a straight line and at a consistent speed.  They were silent and no lights were observed.  The underside of the craft were illuminated by the night light pollution from the city.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Altitude estimation 5-10K feet.  Cruising speed unknown, but moving much faster than typical commercial aircraft on approach to Hobby Airport.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The craft were black, with a metallic underside - hence the reflection from the city lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Due to my limited field of vision, I only had a short window to observe (5 seconds).<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am a Houston resident.

I was watching it for a few minutes as it was slowly moving southwest.  We decided to head to our back patio to continue watching this bizarre, oval light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About 2 minutes after we first noticed it, it suddenly discharged a smaller orange light which quickly faded off into the distance. At this point, the large bright light was just hovering, not moving anywhere!<n> <n><n> <n><n> Another 2 minutes passed of this bright orange light hovering, somewhat fading, when it suddenly got brighter again and shot off yet another smaller orange light off into the distance!<n> <n><n> <n><n> Immediately after the second small orange light was discharged, the large orange light started to fade until it disappeared.  It was fading up into space.<n>

I discarded it as an airplane originally and didn’t pay too much attention to it.  I didn’t even look at it at that point.  Something didn’t seem right about it so once I sat down, I paid more attention to it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The light was flashing very rapidly and almost a twinkling type of flashing.  It was not the typical flashing of an airplane or helicopter.  It was very distinctly rapid (more rapid than an airplane or helicopter lights). I’ve never seen anything flash like that.  The object seemed to be stationary at first.  I stared at it and it still seemed to stay still.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I kept watching it I noticed the object was moving further away.  I originally saw the light in the western sky and it was moving towards the northwest and was gaining altitude.  I watched it until I couldn’t see it anymore.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I couldn’t tell the shape of the object but my first instinct tells me it might have been a cylinder type shape, but I cannot say for sure.  This was very strange and I have never seen anything like it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I did see an airplane shortly after (2 minutes or so) and it seemed to be heading in the same general direction, but did not appear to be chasing it.  The plane seemed to be a coincidence and did not seem to be associated or even aware it was ahead of it.<n>

It seemed to almost look electrical.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The sky was clear all around it, and the ball it self was almost a lime or emerald green.  I called my mother to tell her what I was seeing in my backyard.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was not scared I just had no idea what it was.  It did not even occur to me to take a picture!<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had watched some shows on television and I just so happened to see the same thing!

What was weird about it is I did not feel scared as I was staring at the object.  It was there the entire time I was outside, which was possibly 15 minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In addition, I got the feeling I should go inside, not that I was scared, just that it was time to go inside, I never saw it again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates neither the time, nor the date, of the sighting.

3/28/14 14:00|Corpus Christi|TX|Cylinder|varied|Multiple event over 10 years.|4/4/14|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/108/S108155.html|66|ndxe201403| Multiple event over 10 years.<n> <n><n> <n><n> UFO Report  I am writing this down for the first time in my life.  I am 57 yrs old, these things I swear by all that matters are true and did happen to the best of my recollection over the course of my life in Corpus Christi, Texas.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 1st contact with strangeness:<n> <n><n> <n><n> The summer of 1967 was very hot, muggy as I recall.  One day in june or July of that year 3 men dressed in black suits, white shirt, black ties and black sunglasses appeared (actually I saw them walk up the steps)on front porch screen door.  They knocked and stood very erect and still together, they looked like candles as recall, they were not the same height, but they were very thin, tall and very white.  Their hair was white or blond and appeard plastered to their heads with wavy plastered curles on their foreheads.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I came to the door and asked what they wanted.  One of them bent down and stuck his nose close to the screen door at eye-level with me (I was 10 yrs old) and asked me…”where are your parents?”  I told him that my folks were at work and he said….”well they should be home, tell them we came looking for them.”  This was sorta not done in a nice manner and rather scared me.  My big sister (she was 13 yrs old) and I her room, I backed away from the door and yelled out her name to come to the door.  The turned around t walk down the steps to their car, a long black Lincoln or what looked like a crown Victoria.  I turned to look to see if my sister was coming to door, when I turned around back to the screen door to look down the porch at them men walking to their car to get in it, they weren’t there, they and the car were gone.  I never saw them get in car, I never heard the car start, nor did I ever see the car drive away down the street.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 2ND EVENT:  	Over the course of the next year or so, 1967 to 1968, my parents, mainly my dad, began complaining about a pain in his heel.  Eventually, he had me look at his right foot heel for some sort of splinter or spur that he thought was stuck in his heel.  My dad had me probe his heel with needle where he thought the pain was.  I did this over the course of several weeks looking for this thing my dad thought he had in his heel.  Eventually, I was able to dig out of my dad’s heel this chip or sliver of metal, it was thin and small but very visible.  It was metal or at least had glint like metal, aluminum.  A few months later, my dad removed a piece of metal from my mom’s heel and my sister’s heel.  I had one in my foot pad that I took out, too.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 3RD EVENT:  	In the summer of 1970, August 3rd, Corpus Christi was devastated by hurricane Celia, it wiped out the city, martial law was imposed, the National Guard shot and killed 9 looters over the course of the next two months.  We were without power or electricity until mid-October of that year.  Soon after power was restored, one night in my outside my bedroom window, late at night, very bright red and blue lights appeared in backyard.  The lights moved up and down through a very heavily branched cedar tree.  I didn’t get up out of bed because I was way too scared to see.  Later that night, I woke up and I am not sure if I was hallucinating and seeing small little people with big fat heads and very big eyes in room looking around.  I put the covers over head and wished they would go away.  Nothing else happened then I fell asleep.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 4TH EVENT:  	Summer, July 1976, cabinis field Baseball Park.  Divisional game between Carroll high and king high.  Skylab is in orbit.  During the middle of game the PA announcer who is calling the ball game, says that skylab will be visible to the crowd (about 2500people) as it makes its orbit around earth.  The PA announcer knows the exact time and the direction from which skylab will appear from the horizon, I believe he told everyone to look to the southeast of cabinis field, as I looked up to the ‘clear blue sky’, directly out of the south in clear view came an object it was cylindrical, dark and gray, had no markings, some external equipment and crooked arm sticking out of it with red glowing bulb at the end of the crooked arm.  It was clearly visible, the PA announcer and another man in the booth began to argue about the object and it begin too low and not coming from the correct direction.  The object came directly over the ball field, not more than a few hundred to a thousand feet, it! s details were very visible to me.  The men in the PA booth of the ballpark continued to argue over the loud speaker about the object finally the head PA announcer said to drop it, nothing more was said. I remember going down the stands to the concession stand and people looking bewildered and dazed.  I got in my car and drove home in disbelief.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Over the following years, I had no more interesting events happen to me, things were quiet and calm, but from time to time I have events of precognition or clairvoyance were I find somewhat disturbing.  I have learned to control myself and these precognitive thoughts or clairvoyance and try to lead a good, better life.<n>

I don&#39;t think so.  Oh and the lights were red and white, and once i saw blue flash like twice.<n>

I was looking to the NW, when I saw a slow-moving solid green light proceeding to the east.  It gradually turned a solid red, but only for a few moments before returning to a solid green again at which point it began to gradually descend until it dropped below the tree line and houses in the distance obstructing my view.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A few moments later the green light emerged, but from a different point along the tree line and began proceeding slowly at an angle (up and to the left) before making an arch after which it descended down disappearing below the trees and houses all over again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About a minute later it emerged from yet another point on the horizon, still moving slowly, but this time moving up and down vertically, over and over again, bouncing above and below the trees and homes in the distance until it descended for the last time not to emerge again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object appeared to be far way, at a distance of at least several miles or more, this would be my approximation.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This whole episode lasted about 5 minutes.<n>

As it stands I still am in the dark as to what this could have been, but what happened was this; I was walking home across a local park, when there was a flash of light, which lit up the whole park and everything I could see, but made no sound.  There were large industrial lights at this park so I simply chalked it up to a flickering bulb.  As I walked past the light that I thought it would have been about a minute later the flash happened again, but I still thought little of it, admittedly it was a little strange but I kept walking none the less.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Another minute later I was walking up my street when the flash happened again, this time I was sure there was no regular cause to this, for coming from  past the northern mountains of where I was, a brilliant flash lighting up not only the entire sky, but the whole of my surroundings as well,  but made no sound…  I rushed Up the street to get a better view of the place where the flash had come from, which is Over top Mt Seymour From where I was standing In Deep Cove North Vancouver.  As I stood there staring the brilliant white light flashed again, radiating outward like a sonic boom, but without any sound.  Each occurrence was about 2 minutes apart and the whole sequence of events (4 flashes) lasted for 10 minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am writing this 2 days later, hoping for some conclusive explanations?<n>

I was behind the wheel.  About a half mile from our exit, I noticed what, at first, looked like a very bright star over the area of Fort Detrick, to our left.  My wife noticed it around the same time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Suddenly, we both realized it couldn’t be a star, because it was moving at an extremely high speed, in an easterly direction.  We tried to follow it visually as we exited off the highway at the Motter Road exit.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Turning right onto Motter Road, we crossed a little bridge, and pulled immediately into the empty parking lot of a veterinary office on the right, overlooking Rt. 15.  We could still just barely make out whatever it was we were seeing as it disappeared into the east.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Suddenly, we all noticed directly overhead, two more objects, triangular shaped, all with flashing lights around them.  They were also heading east, but crossing over each other in very close proximity.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then, from the north, we saw one more triangular shaped object, also with flashing lights, heading southeast.  It seemed like it was catching up to the other objects.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Finally, we saw one object north east of our position, that just stayed stationary.  None of these objects made any sound in the entire time we observed them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We watched this for ten or fifteen minutes, before getting in our car and heading home.  On the way home (we live quite near Fort Detrick), we thought we saw one more of the triangular-shaped objects.  It was being followed at high speed by a plane we assumed to be military.<n> <n><n> <n><n> And that’s what we saw.  I should note — our roommate shot pictures and video with her iphone — nothing showed up in either the photos or video.<n>

We were headed what i believe was north.  The beach woas on our right or east side.  We sat at the red light when my husband and his cousin noticed a space craft very low to the ground...maybe 10 stories high.  It hovered over homes or condos that wouldve been close to the beach. It sat moving motionless in the sky.  It did not move for 5 minutes. It had no moise comi.g from it.  It was large, triangular shaped i think.  It had lights 5 0r 6 in a triangle shape which is why i think it was a triangle shaped craft.  It was dark out, but lots of city lights enough to see and know it was not an airplane and not a helicopter.  Im a teA her, i know what those look like.  Mother use to work for delta so i know what planes look like. This wasnt a plane.  As we drove i tried to get a picture bbut couldnt act fast enough.

We stopped the car on one of the country roads and rolled the car window down on the drivers side.  The light started to descend towards the car.  As we realized it was coming to the car, we started to drive again.  It followed us another half of a mile keeping pace.  As we slowed again, I saw white lights come out both sides of it and it sped up high in the sky.  It was gone very quickly.

I am a Fireman, and was putting my gear in my truck.  I noticed three white lights in the sky.  Not unusual, as I live about 20 miles from BWI airport and can see the flight path of landing planes.  I don&#39;t really know why, but I looked up again and could clearly make out the shape of a large triangle.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was a clear sky and cold out, about 30 degrees.  I live next to the woods and it seemed to be right over the treeline.  If I had to guess, I would say it was about 40 feet long.  The lights remained on, did not flash, were white and did not look like search lights, more like a marker light you would see on a boat.  It did not make any jet or plane like noises.

The bright light flashed 3 times and as fast as I saw the object streak into my view it disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I work in a building right on landing and takeoff zones from Logan airport In Boston and I knew immediately it was not a plane cause there were planes in view at the time moving at 1/10 of the speed of the object I saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Length of sighting was approx 5 seconds.<n>

I looked out the window and saw what I thought was a bright star.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then it flashed bright and I thought, &#39;that was weird&#39; and kept looking at it.  It was long like a white stick with a blue and red light in the middle area.  About every 5 secs it would flash brighter or flicker on &amp; off, I couldn&#39;t tell.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Anyway, I figured it was eye fatigue and was either a plane or a star but then I noticed it was moving ever so slightly on a horizontal line to the right (North).  I kept watching it because I figured I was tired and would figure out that it wasn&#39;t moving at all but it did and kept moving.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So I decided to step outside and have a look.  First thing I noticed is how quite it was... dead silent.  There&#39;s usually the sound of traffic on Hwy 70 at the minimum or a dog barking but nope... nothing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then I noticed a second &#39;star&#39; with the exact same qualities as the first and verified the other one was still where I had last seen it so... there were actually two ! of them.  Both were silent, high up, looked identical and were moving very, very slowly in a horizontal motion heading North.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I watched them for about 10 mins and then went back inside cold and alittle bit freaked out.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Not sure what they were but they definitely were not helicopters or planes as there was no sound and they were moving way too slowly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;m a 53 yrs old Computer Scientist who works at NC State in the IT division.<n>

It looked like it was vibrating, or doing what teenagers do swerving in a car driving down the road. It was heading southeast. It looked like a ring.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There were no lights on it, and all aircraft has to have lights.  It was as close as the clouds were to the ground, and was about 150-200 ft in diameter.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The color of it was almost like the clouds, camouflage, but the clouds were moving so fast it couldn&#39;t mask itself.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We immediately pulled over and got out to look but it was gone.<n>

We were able to clearly see the it was a black triangle with bright orange pointed lights on the ends.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The middle light appeared to suddenly shrink in size and then the object moved right over our heads at an incredibly slow speed.  There was no sound whatsoever.  It was eerily silent.  My girlfriend took a video on her Iphone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In the video, I am approximately 20 yards ahead of her yelling for her to film what was happening.  She was able to film the object sitting perfectly still.  She was holding her Iphone in landscape mode (horizontal) for the first 23 seconds.  She began to run while filming the object for the remainder of the video holding her phone in portrait mode (vertical).<n> <n><n> <n><n> 33 seconds into the video shows the middle light shrink and then ends.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Once the light shrank, it began to move over us.<n>

These lights appeared to be dropping very rapidly in altitude and I thought that they may be a series of meteors.<n> <n><n> <n><n> These lights took on a triangle shape and leveled off at what seemed to be tree-top level.<n> <n><n> <n><n> These lights were distinctly craft shape and I thought that they may be large cargo planes headed to Robins Air Force Base.  I have seen large cargo planes like the C-130 heading on this flight path many times, but never this low or with lights only amber in color.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It appeared that there was at least two crafts which leveled off and accelerated at a very rapid pace, which seemed impossible for any cargo plane I have ever seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have three other people who saw these same crafts at the same date and time from different parts of town.<n>

It appeared to have multiple green ligts, 2 red blinking lights and 1 yellow light in the back.  I pulled  my car off to side of the road and rolled down my windows to try and listen, it was slient with no down wind.  At first I thought it was a helicopter but there was no noise. It stayed in one position then slowly just went off to right in direction of reservoir I lost track of it through the trees. There were no cars on the road and there are no houses on that particular part of Marriottsville.  It lasted about a minute just wondering if anyone else in area saw anything?<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

3/26/14 00:15|Redding|CA|Unknown|2 minutes|Orange glow moving randomly in the northern sky.|3/27/14|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/108/S108100.html|106|ndxe201403| Orange glow moving randomly in the northern sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In the Northern sky, I witnessed an orange blob about 40 degrees above horizon.  It seemed to have a bit of size to it, not like a point like a star or airplane light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Weather, cloudy, intermittent rain. This means elevation was likely low, below or just at cloud level.  There was no &#34;beam&#34; of light as typical from airplane landing lights, rather it just glowed.  Brightness was about as bright as Venus at it&#39;s brightest, but was not as brilliant due to orange color.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It moved at a very slow pace in a random pattern, almost like a leaf floating in a very very gentile breeze or bird gliding very slowly on a thermal.  Movements were too tight to have been a manned aircraft.  There was nothing consistent in its direction.  Very Random.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After a few minutes it started to move north very very slowly and just slowly faded out. Likely gained elevation and was covered by clouds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> No sound accompanied the object and it seemed close enough that an aircraft would have been heard.<n>

I was traveling on my motorcycle so I had an unobstructed view of the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Almost immediately after  accelerating I noticed a single white/yellowish light come into view in my far left peripheral vision.  At first I assumed it was an approaching aircraft because its color and shape appeared like a standard front mounted aircraft approach light.  I also assumed this because I frequently see aircraft in this area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I quickly realized this was not a typical aircraft because of the speed at  which it was traveling across the sky.  It was moving in a direction of NW to SE, from my left to my right. It did not have navigational strobe lights or any other lights other than the one.  Compared to typical aircraft I would say it was traveling at mach 2.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It did not change altitude and the intensity of the light stayed constant the whole time, including when I would have been looking at the hypothetical back of the craft.  It maintained a constant direction and speed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I lifted the clear shield of my helmet expecting to hear a sonic boom or a loud jet engine but heard nothing.  Not knowing the actual size of the craft I estimated its altitude to be at 5,000 to 20,000 ft.  It cleared the whole sky, from tree top to tree top within a matter of seconds.  I lost sight of it in between Gilligan&#39;s Way and Cypress Creek.<n>

But one light seemed to stay ahead of me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I maintained visual contact with it in my car and finally got close enough in Broad Brook, Connecticut.  It had a bright pale yellow light and almost seemed to hover.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Very suddenly it got 10 times brighter, its color changing into a bright white light and it moved very rapidly towards me.  And as it drew very close, its color again dimmed to a pale yellow and it slowed almost into a hover.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It then proceeded to turn towards the northwest.  As it did, I saw it had 4 pale yellow lights with a red, blue, amber and green light next to each pale yellow light.  It leveled off, got very bright again, and took of so fast I lost contact.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This object was ! no commercial aircraft and it moved far too fast to be a helicopter or a tilt rotor aircraft such as an Osprey.<n> <n><n> <n><n> And note, no aircraft, civilian or military, has an amber light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

I have not seen everything, but I have seen a lot.  Over the last few weeks, tonight included, I&#39;ve seen more.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Leaving my girlfriends house here in Springfield, MA, about two weeks ago, I noticed something odd in the sky traveling south in my direction.  It was low, fast, big and soundless.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Looking straight toward it, it was one bright white light.  As it passed it seemed &#34;domed disk&#34; in shape.  The white light was in the front and along the edge between, seemingly, the disk and the dome were four different color blinking lights.  Red, blue, amber and teal.  It soon banked south west then quickly south again and then south east.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was trying to follow it there and lost sight.  That&#39;s when it doubled back and went almost directly over head.  I&#39;m not telling you I know what I saw, but I will tell you I know what I didn&#39;t see.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I could draw this thing if you asked me to.  Underneath were four circles.  The two in the front were a little smaller than the two in the back.  In each of the circles were the same four colored lights.  The body of the ship connected to them in a curved pattern almos! t like webbed feet and was dark.  The nose flew lower than the tail as well.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It ended up quickly changing direction west toward the CT river.  There it paused for a while.<n> <n><n> <n><n> By this time I made it home and ran in to get a rifle scope for a clearer view.  It left in my attempt.  The night was clear and I tilt my head back in aggravation.  That&#39;s when I noticed, spread out, about 9 or 10 very large bright stars.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Using the scope I began to look at them.  They were all blinking.  Tonight, at the same time as the first sighting, 11:30 pm, I left her house again.  I noticed a massive bright light hovering a distance away where I saw the last one advance from.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After a few seconds it began to slowly trek in the same pattern as the first time.  I grabbed my phone for a pic, but the battery was to low.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I put it on the charger and began to follow it again.  It in the blink of an eye sped up.  It banked in the same direction as the last time but never doubled back.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Just as my disappointment  set in from not getting a pic, a second one(have photo) came toward ! me from the left.  I quickly grabbed my phone and got off one shot before it sped away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The night is very cloudy(3-25-14) as snow is expected to fall.  This photo is NOT the moon.  You can see barely how low it it is and the image was bigger and closer than my cheap camera phone makes it appear.  None the less, you can see it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I text a buddy in CT as they were headed in his direction.  He is fairly well learned on popular aircraft so he got in his car to see if he could spot them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Skeptical at first, his attitude quickly changed.  I cannot word for word give you his testament, but we would gladly meet with you to discuss what we saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n> He got a very good view that left him slightly spooked.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Know this, I have never had a drop of alcohol in my life, nor do I smoke, use drugs, or am I on medication.  What I saw, I saw.  I have never been a skeptic, but at the same time, never thought I&#39;d get to see it for myself.  After the second time, I don&#39;t have a doubt in my mind.<n>

Thinking it was unusual, yet pretty, I did still and watched it for awhile.  It began moving in almost circular patterns, though it wasn&#39;t very fast.  I&#39;ve seen plenty of planes flying around at night before, and I can tell the difference began this, and those. Planes tend to move faster than it was.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I didn&#39;t know what to think of it, and its pretty cold outside so I went back in with my dog.  It was still moving when I left.

As soon as I saw them the lights turned off and I could still see movement in the sky.  It happened very fast.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I turned to look at my husband and he asked if I saw it.

On Monday March 25th, 2014, my friend and I were looking at the stars out my bedroom window which faces the mountains.  We had all the lights off in my room so it was pitch black.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I’m looking at the stars I notice this one light almost jumping up and down in the distance.  I say to my friend, “Do you see that moving over there?  What is that?”<n> <n><n> <n><n> Initially she goes it’s a plane but I pointed out the way it was moving up and down so quickly there’s no way it could have been a plane.  It was still moving up and down from the left of our field of view to the right.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We both stared at it for another 20 seconds trying to determine what it was.  Soon I notice it is getting closer to us as it’s moving to the right.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I mention this to my friend and she agrees it’s coming closer to us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I ask her to shut the window but she insists on not doing so yet.  In silence we both stare the object coming closer to my house through the sky.  I can now fully make out the object which is in a shape which is almost similar to that of a peppermint..  It has black rectangular windows evenly spaced around it and the object is rotating counterclockwise as it is moving through the sky closer to my house.  There are small slights spaced around the top and bottom of the circular craft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We can both also see that there is another craft to the left of it.  The shape we could not determine could only see it was large and possible flat with lights spaced around the perimeter moving downward next to the other craft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Nether of the crafts made any sound.  As this point we both panic and shut the windows.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My friend sees the second craft go over my house and loses the original one.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We go inside and hide in my closet.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We come out after 10 min and whatever was there was gone.<n>

I zoomed in on the Big orange one and it appeared to be moving slowing arround in an irratic behavior so it was hard to keep it in sight, I braced my hands on the car window to keep the phone steady and began taking lots of pictures. in the camera the pictures just look completley round, but when i put them onto my computer i was amazed to see that some looked like a sunny side up Egg, or a donut with a Hexagon shape in the middle. whats strange is when i look at the picture of the orange one on my computer it shows up as whitish whith green in the middle. and when i look at the greenish blue one on the computer it shows up as Bright orange with a hexagon shape in the middle. these seem to only move a short distance at a time.  There is one picture that looks not round at all but appears to be a bright long thing and appears to have a shape of the cross at the top and a Map of some sort behind and all around it.I can always seem to find the area in the sky to find them because they are bright with color.  I tried to look at the orange one with high powered binnoculars and it kinda scared me because when i looked at it, it still looked orange and round but this time in the middle it looked like a single worm or some type of organism was moving around very fast like crazy at a rapid speed inside or in the middle of the orb.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I can&#39;t be sure if it&#39;s a UFo but i can&#39;t identify it and i&#39;m not sure what it is.  I have about 30 pictures.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We commend the witness for having captured the photos, but they do not appear to us to be photos of authentic UFOs.

It was too high to get any kind of clear picture using my phone.  It was moving in a northward direction for about 15 to 20 minutes and then turned and went west until it was far enough away that I could not see it anymore.

I was traveling south.<n> <n><n> <n><n> One block south of me and traveling north toward me, a dark grey and black saucer-shaped craft topped the hill.  It was as wide as the three lanes of traffic and had two red triangular lights on either side in a similar position to where the parking lights are on an automobile but on the bottom edge.  However, no light from these reflected onto the ground and they were not bright like headlights, but they were large rectangles and most definitely red.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The largest part of the craft was very dark gray and the top “bubble” part was black.  This craft was only a few inches off the roadway.  My light changed and as I proceeded toward it, it was as if something came between us and it was no longer visible.  As there was nothing there to actually come between us, I feel as if it “cloaked! ” itself, but it was gone.  This area is very well lit as there are street lights on either side and there are businesses on both sides of the road so my visibility was excellent.  At this time of morning, there was no one else on the road except for it and me.  This road runs directly behind my house and this happened 1/2 block north from my backyard.  I went home and immediately called my friend who I had just dropped off and told her about it.  However, over a period of 20 minutes, we were only able to maintain a phone connection for about 5 minutes, as our call would get dropped and I would get the message “Call Failed” which never comes through when a call is dropped but rather when it doesn’t go through to begin with.  I would try to call her back and it would do absolutely nothing.  Just like dead air.   She left me a voicemail message but my phone had not rang.  She would call me and get the same nothing.  One time, I called her and as the phone was ringing, it soun! ded as if there was a third party on the line and I could hear! some sc ratching like claws on a piece of wood but just when the call should have gone to voicemail, it just disconnected and I got the “Call Failed” message.  She said when we finally were able to talk that she had never experienced anything like that ever before with a cell phone.  I hadn’t either.  I was unable to go to sleep until about 6:00 a.m.  The next day she told me that she had checked the Arlington Police Dept. active police “blotter” after we hung up and that from 3:00 a.m. until 3:30 a.m. there had been 9 calls to 911 that were only classified as “disturbances” within a 1-mile radius of where this occurred and my house.  She tried to take a screen shot of this information, but it would not work.  I can get a copy of that night’s activity from the police department, but cannot do so for 30 days.  At that time, I will forward you a copy of that to go with this report.<n>
3/24/14 02:00|Moab|UT|Light|15 seconds|I saw two reddish-orange soft colored lights traveling horizontally perfectly in line together at a low altitude with no sound.|3/27/14|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/108/S108061.html|140|ndxe201403| I saw two reddish-orange soft colored lights traveling horizontally perfectly in line together at a low altitude with no sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At about 1:45 or 2:00 am, I was outside in my back yard.  I was sitting in a chair, looking up at the sky on a clear night.  I looked down and when I looked up again, I immediately saw two amber or reddish-orange, soft-colored (not extremely bright) round-shaped lights nearly directly over my head.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They were traveling from the east, rounding towards the north, slightly northwest.  As they rounded towards the north, I stood up because the corner of my house blocked my view.  I walked to the corner of my house to continue watching the lights until they faded out of sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The lights were consistent – no blinking or changes in the size, color or brightness of the lights.  They were low in the sky.  As a comparison, it was about the distance of a low-flying helicopter and the size of each light was roughly one-fourth the size of a low-flying helicopter being viewed from the ground.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They passed almost directly over my head, where I could very clearly view the two lights – one traveling at the exact same speed and direction, close behind the other.  From my view, there was no change in the distance between the two lights.  They traveled very smoothly in a horizontal direction, directly in line with each other.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was no sound, and it was an extremely quiet night, so if there had been any sound, it would have been easy to hear it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I watched them as they traveled towards the northwest and faded out of my sight.  As they traveled to the northwest, I was watching them from behind the second light, but could still see the light that was pointed in the direction they were traveling – until they got too far for me to see them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> All of this took place in about 15 seconds (maximum of 30 seconds) – from the moment I first saw the lights overhead to the point that they faded from my sight.<n>

Turn from 2 bright gold/white lights and merge into one.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Red and blue flashing going across my bedroom window at a visible high speed and one very bright light which I have never seen there before (I always look in the window at night) which seems to be moving around.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Sometimes its looking like it&#39;s coming closer towards me then it looks like its going father into the distance.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It has now got increasingly smaller in size, looks like a pin prick where as before hand the original light was huge.<n>
3/23/14 23:35|Lancaster|PA|Triangle|30 minutes|Large triangular object, 3 lights, moving south very slowly.|3/27/14|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/108/S108048.html|142|ndxe201403| Large triangular object, 3 lights, moving south very slowly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was outside cleaning a towel, I just cut my hair.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I look up to enjoy the view and notice a large triangular object hovering at aprox. 10000 ft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The triangle pointed directly SOUTH, traveling very slow, no sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Lights of the vertexes were blinking/fading slightly.  Front light was white, left-green, right-red.<n> <n><n> <n><n> VERY LARGE.  Would be at least a quarter mile long.<n>

Travelled 140 degrees across sky directly above Darfield, then instantly disappearing.  Moving from southwest to northeast at satilite speed. 23.4.14 9:38pmThe 2 red dots are seen from Darfield looking towards the dairy factory when photo taken.  Both appeared slightly distorted circles, very large and distant, vibrant reddish orange.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Seen for over a Minuit with other witness.  The pair were travelling south approx 70 degrees of observation, dancing around each other gently as they moved over the plains.  One instantly disappeared, then small shooting star Travelling down on an angle BELOW the mountain line, then second slowly faded from sight as it began ascending<n>

The color was white and it was extremely bright.  The light was a half mile away and it hovered at about 500’ to my left.  The light did not move at all.  Everyone in the vehicle saw it.  My dash camera was not on so I plugged it in and looked again and it was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The light was very strange.  Even though it was extremely bright it did not illuminate any of the trees under it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have been on Army, Navy, Marine, Coast Guard, and Air Force bases, and I have never seen anything like it.<n>

One blue, one green, one red. Flying West to East in a line equally spaced apart.  No sound at all.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After about 15 seconds of moving toward the East, the lights slowly stopped.  The red and green light got very close together, while the blue light stayed where it was.  Then all three slowly faded out.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My dog stopped immediately and looked at the lights.  He never pays any attention to planes that fly over.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Could not see any object that the lights were attached to.  No outline of a plane or other aircraft.  They seemed to be flying pretty low for a normal airplane as well.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We live right in the flight path for Gateway airport, and other planes seemed to be flying around these lights like they weren&#39;t even there.<n>

3/23/14 20:00|Portland|OR|Unknown|30 seconds|Very fast moving object with red and blue lights.|3/27/14|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/108/S108062.html|147|ndxe201403| Very fast moving object with red and blue lights<n> <n><n> <n><n> My 3-year-old daughter and I were getting home from a barbeque and it had just gotten dark.  As I pulled her out of the car I noticed an object moving very fast from south to north above the tree line on our hill.  It had red and blue lights flashing, like an airplane or helicopter, and it was the size of a small airplane, but did not have wings.<n> <n><n> <n><n> From what I could tell, it was oval-shaped, but it was moving very fast and the lights were blinking brightly so it was hard to make out an exact shape.  It traveled from the south side of the hill to about the middle of the hill.  Normally planes fly over our house at an extremely high altitude, but this was very low and moving so fast, I thought it was going to crash.  But then it disappeared behind the trees.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I thought it could have been a helicopter, but it didn’t look like a helicopter and it was going way too fast to be one.  About 2 seconds later, it darted out and went north to south.  Then, after it hover! ed for about 2 seconds it took off, going south to north again.  It was zig zagging like this for about 30 seconds, and it was very unsettling, it seemed like it was scanning the area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I didn’t want to be outside anymore because it was very frightening, so I ran to my front door carrying my daughter and we got inside fast.  I didn’t look out the window to see if it was still out there, so it could have gone on longer, but I only witnessed about 30 seconds of this zig-zagging movement.<n>

Just a round sphere with nothing hanging from if.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My wife saw it, too.  We watched it for about an hour and then cloud cover stopped our view.<n>

I then reviewed the full 29 minutes at regular speed; however, 20 minutes into it, I notice a flash of light; so, I took it back slightly and slowed the speed down to .125 of full speed.  It was at that point when I noticed what appeared to be a silver or grey saucer-shaped object flying from the top right of my screen, and going left (with a slight downward angle), then swooped upward @ about a 45o angle.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Upon review, I realized that this COULD NOT be one of ours; as this traveled at least 1/2 of a mile or more in a matter of .33 seconds; and that would put it at well over Mach 1 speed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The craft was very far away, and was filmed with my Nikon CoolPix L120 video camera/camera.  I have the original Sand Disk, and am more than happy to provide any information or materials you might need; with regard to investigating this sighting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;ve reached out to a local station (Fox 9), out of Minneapolis; and they have yet to return my call; as promised.  I was told of your site; hence, my contacting you today, instead of the same day of the sighting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thank you for your time, and I will look forward to your return call.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Regards,  ((name deleted))<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  The photos indicate a tiny, dark, blurry &#34;smudge.&#34;  The video forwarded to our Center shows absolutely nothing that we can detect.

It showed red and white lights, and spun very quickly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It seemed to slowly bob up and down, but in a more controlled manner, like it required much more force.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was just above a tree line, but since the sun hadn&#39;t risen yet, therefore I was unable to observe the exact color of the craft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was only one craft, but judging from proportion, it was adequately large.<n>
3/23/14|Lawrenceburg|KY|Circle||Three yellow objects observed in the night sky.|3/27/14|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/108/S108098.html|154|ndxe201403| Three yellow objects observed in the night sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The night in question was calm with a clear sky.  I walked outside on the patio and noticed two circular objects in the sky to the southwest.  These objects were yellow in color and were stationary.  The color caught my attention.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was drastically different from the stars.  I watched for a couple of minutes until one began to move off to the southwest and then the second object followed.  They did not move out of sight, they just faded out.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About 30 minutes later, another object appeared that was identical to the previous objects.  My wife observed this one also.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As we watched this object moved southwest and faded out as the first two had.<n>

Normally my dogs would be going crazy, but they were oblivious to anything going on.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It took me about 5 seconds to get outside, the object was not a helicopter.  I started thinking a drone of some kind, still no noise, and no definition to the object.  It was not shining an orange light anywhere, it was as orange light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It looked like fire, it had moved about 75 degrees to the left (west) and was also about a third the original size, like it had moved away from my location going north.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I yelled my wife awake and she came down to see the light.  By then is was much smaller, like a giant star, still orange.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It moved west to east about 90 degrees, then straight north with a small rise is elevation until it disappeared.<n>

It was strange in that they did not look like they were in any specific formation, but an irregular group of lights spread out for quite a distance.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They seemed to be coming in from the north and then traveled slowly to the east and back to the north again.  It also seemed as the last couple disappeared that the lite turned whitish in color?<n> <n><n> <n><n> Even though the lights were above the treeline, it seemed that they were fairly far away.  I would say at least a couple of miles distant from the point where I was standing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My background is I am retired mid 50&#39;s male, and the vantage point of my observation was from our shoreline on the lake.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was just buttoning up the house before going to bed when I spotted the lights.

My fiancee then asked if I was seeing the 5 lights that were lined up in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I looked right and sure enough there were 5 more lights not to far from the original 3 I saw.  They were slowly moving across the sky to the West.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We then noticed several cars pulled over on the side of the road with people staring up and pointing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I pulled over on Calks Ferry Rd. and my Fiancee got out of the car, another car coming the opposite direction pulled up and the driver and her friend asked if we were stopped because of the lights, which to me confirmed we weren&#39;t just seeing things.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The lights that were lined up in a line started fading first, one after the other.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then the 3 I originally saw in a triangle formation all faded at the same time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They were clearly visible for at least 3 minutes.<n>

My friend called us over, first one out of the house was my female friend and she started to film the event though the cellphone camera could only pick up the center bottom light, at eye level it was close but and we could see the detail of the  craft but the camera could only show the light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My female friend called me to come out side but almost could not speak and as I came to see what was going on the craft began to move back and forth between trees as fast as if you blink your eyes, my heart started to beat fast and the object started spinning really fast and it looked like it was morphing at this point we saw port hole like windows that were lit in a blue or  purple coloring as the craft moved we saw the top of the craft and had a an hill shape roof.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The sound it made while spinning was a wooing.  The strange part was the sky was clear but pitch black with no one outside almost as if time had completely stopped and 3 of us are the only ones outside.<n> <n><n> <n><n> While we filmed the event a loud jet sound started approaching all the sudden a fighter jet flew at a low altitude and the craft did a z shape flight patern and took off the fighter jet passed right above us and made a quick upward turn, when the jet got distant from us the craft came back to the same spot then took off again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We thought it was over as I went back inside my female friend was still outside and the craft came back above the roof of the house and a second light of a yellow color touch down on the roof it was the size of a softball, my friend called me out while filming and before I turned around the yellow light went back to he craft as a flash, which we caught on camera and the craft took off at a speed that no man made craft that we know of can move.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We thought it was finaly over, my male friend got in his car and started driving back home, while he was driving on the blvd.  He saw the craft flying right next to him at the same speed of the car and he started filming it during his drive then the craft took off again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Replaying all the videos we took, we picked up a binging sound like a sonar, we did not pick up the wooing sound on the video though after constant replay we are seeing shadows on the roof of the house in the video.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I forgot to mention while this event happened all internet and cell phone communication was down which we have never experienced in our location, and the object had 3 windows , plus seemed like a light tail when moving.<n>

We had not left the lot when we saw an odd object seemingly hanging motionless in the sky, more or less north of our position.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first we thought it was a helicopter, but on closer examination it appeared to be irregularly shaped, and a solid black.  Although the sun was shining through light haze we saw no reflections off the surface.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We stopped the car and parked again, facing the object, and watched it from both inside and outside the car for about 10 minutes.  During this time the object very slowly moved toward us and a little to the west.  When we left to do other errands it was still there.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was little wind, but it did not move like a balloon, bobbing with air currents, but directionally, for want of a better word.  It continually changed shape, although it never took on any regular shape and always appeared as an irregular polygon.  It could have been rotating but it was hard to tell because of the fully black appearance.  It did appear to be more changing shape than rotating from a subjective perception.  It&#39;s hard to imagine a rigid solid shape that could rotate and be all those different appearances.<n> <n><n> <n><n> While we watched it I noticed that another smaller irregular black object was nearby and this object would move toward the main one and seem to disappear, and then move away from it again. I pointed this out to my wife and she did see this second object.  After a while I noticed that there was a sort of grey halo of light around the object, perfectly circular, and when I mentioned this to her, she exclaimed, &#34;I thought I was seeing things! I see it too!&#34; or something to that effect.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I went outside the car and could see the halo from that position as well, although the glare from haze made it harder.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was impossible to tell how far away it was, but it did seem to be a smaller object that was closer rather than a large object farther away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My wife did a search on youtube for &#34;amorphous black ufo&#34; and found a number of videos that were pretty similar to what we had seen except they didn&#39;t have a smaller object that came and went.<n>

As I was sitting in line to park, a KC 135 R was taxing into position to take off in the direction of the water ( Gulf of Mexico - Tampa Bay Intercoastal ) .<n> <n><n> <n><n> This Aircraft, being one of my favorite, was less than 1000 feet away from my vehicle . Looking through my window I said &#34;  That would make a nice picture &#34;.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At this point in time, I pulled out my brand new Canon 50 D DSLR and attached my Canon 70-200mm f2.8 I S lens to the camera, swung it out the window and started to take the images , into the third or fourth frame, I observed the very bright lights flying from right to left at a high altitude even with the tail fin of the aircraft.  These I thought might have been the F-16s in a pattern waiting to land, moving very fast and then disappearing as quickly as they arrived .<n> <n><n> <n><n> I finished shooting and continued to park my vehicle on the closed hard stand outside some of the hangars.  This was a mere 3 minutes from taking the images, when I noticed that all the F-16s were already on display on the active flight line.  Now I scanned the sky for 5 minutes and never saw any additional aircraft land at the base at all.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I returned home, I immediately edited the images, and posted them to a closed Facebook - Aviation Photography of Miami aircraft spotters page.  With in 12 hours of posting these images, a member sends me a link to your website.  When I open the link , there is a thread about a sighting of lights in the sky over Florida last week.  The description is dead on, but the poster had no images .<n> <n><n> <n><n> I do have the images . 37 to be in the ballpark.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This link is to my web page flickr account.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This set, I used different color changing filters to enhance the lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Note: These are not birds.  There are birds in the last 3 images.  The altitude is so much different than the white lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> http://m.flickr.com/#/photos/boneheadsboneyards/sets/72157642963566633/<n>

The craft flew within 600 feet of us. 2 rows of bright lights one red and one green.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My wife and I saw a craft with very bright red and green lights flying from a higher altitude flying erratically making sharp turns very quickly then stop in the sky.  Then we watched it drop very quickly to a lower altitude near the ground then right back up again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After watching it for a few minutes, it starting flying towards us, and we were preparing to run in the house, when it turned to the left about 600 feet away from us.  As it turned we could hear a sound something like an electric motor but not exactly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We couldn&#39;t see the shape because the lights which were a row of red and a row of green were so bright that you could not see what was above them.  Our house blocked our view when it turned so we ran around to the front of the house and could see that it was about a quarter mile away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I saw a neighbor in his garage so I called him out to see the UFO.  He came out then pulled out his cell phone and used it to video it as it moved off and disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The area that we think it stopped the first time is about 5 miles from our house.  Once it started towards us it took about 30 seconds before it turned when it was about 600 feet from us and about 300 feet in the air.  I estimate the size of the lights to have been about 30 to 60 feet long and 20 to 30 feet between the lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We also noticed a large white light in the sky which appeared to move up toward the area where the craft first stopped then stop in the sky.  We forgot about that until we noticed it again when we lost sight of the craft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I saw it just sitting there in the sky but after taking a ride to see if we could find the red a green lights again the white light was gone.  I&#39;m not sure it that was anything other than a bright white light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I worked as a flight line mechanic in the Marine Corps for 4 years and I know how aircraft fly, and this one was not any type of conventional aircraft.<n>

The lights seemed to hover over what looked to be over the green belt area off of Emerson and Orchard.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I got closer towards the intersection of Orchard and Emerson the objects appeared to hover and then the three objects changed direction, moving from right to left (eastward).<n> <n><n> <n><n> As they made this move, the triangle formation expanded and became bigger.  As I made a right turn from Orchard onto Emerson I pulled off to the road hand side of the road to watch them<n> <n><n> <n><n> (https://www.google.com/maps/@47.2209661,-122.5086383,360m/data=!3m1!1e3).<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was another car pulled off on the other side of the road we didn’t talk.  I stayed there about 10 mins watching the objects.  As I was watching them they flew in this bigger triangle towards the South, towards Lakewood.  I made a U turn back onto Emerson.  I made a right turn back onto Orchard and I was able to see the objects flying towards Lakewood…<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I was on Lakewood Drive (Orchard turns into Lakewood Dr) and 80th St SW one of the objects started to fly off and the other two lights dimmed to a faint gold color and then the objects just went dark.  At this time I was near Stoney Creek Apts and across the street is the Fleet Creek open area (https://www.google.com/maps/@47.1807927,-122.5065424,352m/data=!3m), where I saw the objects black out in the sky and disappear.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Of note the skies were clear and there were many vehicles on Orchard and Emerson.<n>

These occurred on mostly calm nights, with little wind and mostly clear skies, and usually last for 5-10 minutes, some following a &#34;boom boom&#34; pattern, other times not.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On the 18th of this month, the local ABC news station, WFTV, ran a news story on the evening newscast on &#34;mysterious booms&#34; being reported in Osceola County, and verified that I was not the only one that was hearing this.  Most reports have come from the St. Cloud area, but the sounds are also said to be heard on different areas in Osceola County.  I prefer to remain anonymous.<n>

There was 4 orange lights moving north.  They were not moving in a perfect line looked very erratically.  If you held your hand out at arms length and used your index finger and thumb to gauge distance, there was about 2in. between the top 2 and bottom 2.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When they all reached a certain point they faded out.  They didn&#39;t turn out like a switch, it was a slow fade out.  After the first 4 all disappeared, 2 more followed.  These 2 were side by side about 3-4in. apart.  Same exact thing, they faded out at exactly the same point the first 4 did.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I tried to record with my phone, however I was in an industrial park.  The building across the street had lights along the roof.  They were barely visible on the phone recording.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first I thought they may have been a plane coming into a landing pattern.  A plane came in approx. 30-45 sec. after the last 2 disappeared it had 5 white lights and a red/green flashing.  Also you could hear the plane.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We have corrected the date above.  We spoke with the witness on the evening of March 20, so we&#39;re sure of the date.

I saw it with my mom and dad.  My mom and dad were watching TV when my mom spotted something in the sky.  She called me over and we looked.  The UFO was towards the East, and it was a little lower than a normal plane would fly.  It was a circular disk with three green lights and three red lights in a row.  It was about the size of 1/3 of the moon. The lights were three times the size of an airplane’s lights.  It hovered up, down, back and forth in a strange routine.  It stayed there for about 20 seconds, hovering in different positions.  When it left, it looked as if it was diving.  It was lowering away slowly, but then dashed away very quickly before it disappeared from our point of view.  It looked like it lowered behind the house across the street, yet I felt it was miles away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> Statement 2nd person:<n> <n><n> I live in Jordan, MN. On March 20, 2014, approximately 8:00 pm, my wife and I were in our family room watching TV.  I had just gotten up from the couch and was walking to the kitchen when my wife yelled, &#34;Look at this!&#34;  I turned and noticed she was looking out our windows toward the East.  I looked immediately out our dining room patio door also towards the East.  What I saw was three very bright green lights and next to that three red lights.  All were very intense, and the object seemed to be suspended.  The object was approx. 20 degrees above my plane of vision and appeared to be very close, like it was in the neighboring development just above the house that is across the pond in our backyard.   But it wasn’t close, I would say the object was 1/3 the size of a full moon from my perspective.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I watched it, it tilted slightly, then dipped only to come back to the same level it had been at.  This happened a few times, all the while those 3 green and 3 red lights were extremely bright, I would say 3 to 4 times the size of a landing light on a plane, and by the way, I am a private pilot, licensed since 1996, so I am familiar with airplanes and what they look like in the sky, this was no airplane.  One of the times it tilted and dipped, I saw what appeared as a circular gray shadow underneath the lights, also there was a red flashing light underneath.  This whole thing lasted maybe 20 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The last thing I saw was the lights fell away to the right and continued until they were out of sight, blocked by the house behind ours.  The rate at which it descended was smooth and very quick.  Our house is approx 30 miles South West of MSP airport, and we always have airplane traffic visible to the East on a SW heading, again, I am use to seeing the rate at which they pass by our house while they are climbing to altitude.  The object moved down and away at a rate at least 5 times that speed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> Statement 3rd person:<n> <n><n> I live in Jordan, Minnesota; approximately 35 miles Southwest from Minneapolis. I often look out our Living Room windows facing East to watch the planes from the MSP airport fly past our home.  Tonight, March 20th, 2014, at dusk, I looked out the window and about 200 yards away, above our neighbor’s house I saw an object hovering in the air with extremely bright lights.  The long, horizontal shape had a top layer of three greenish-blue lights and a bottom layer of three red lights.  My husband, also curious about these lights, opened the patio door to listen for sound.  I thought as close as this thing looked to our neighbor’s house, we should be able to hear it; but it was quiet.<n> <n><n> <n><n> To help you gauge the size; If you hold your arm out straight and flex your hand, (palm away), the size of each light was comparable to a pinky fingernail.  Then, your arm still stretched, tuck your thumb and pinky finger into the palm of your hand and the width of this object in the sky would be comparable to your three middle fingers held tight together.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object would move a little to the left/downward and then be steady, it moved like this a few times.  The next movement convinced me these lights were not a standard item you see in the sky.  If you can imagine the shape of a banana, the lights tilted and dipped in an arch shape movement and then hovered again at a lower level in the sky. This movement was extremely abrupt, then steady.  The object then glided swiftly at an angle (downward) and we lost sight of it behind the neighbors house.  We saw these lights in the sky for about 20-25 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke via telephone with two of the three witnesses, and they sounded to us to be exceptiongally eloquent and sober-minded.  We suspect that all of the witnesses are exceptionally capable, and have reported here quite accurately.  PD))<n>

It was a single craft unlike any other to my knowledge, very high, moving very fast but what was different is that it was heading towards the open Gulf of Mexico and not in the usual flight paths for this area, i.e., nothing but the open gulf is in the direction it was moving and it left no vapor trails of any sort.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The only description I can think of as to how it was moving was that it appeared to be like that of a fast ball in that although it moved very fast it seemed to be “shimmying” as it went.  The shape was in general like two delta wings hooked together at the apex of each.  I’m sorry I can’t give a better analogy but it was unique in my experience.<n>

It was only about 500ft in the air, travelling at an estimated guess of 500 MPH, could of been faster.  It came from the south and travelled north.  I did not hear any sounds from it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Manchester airport is roughly 50 miles north from here, and at night I can usually see planes which are still gaining altitude quite far away, heading East.  They have white and small red flashing lights on them at night, so I am definitely not mistaken with those.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This blue orb was far too low, travelling too fast and as far as I am aware, no plane has bright blue lights like this.  It was very unique.<n>

I had stopped atop a hill and was looking towards the west, when I spotted a large group of lights (just one object) that appeared straight across.  They were flickering and I seen red, what appeared to be green, and white.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first, I thought it was a large aircraft in the distance coming towards me but after observing this for approximately 5 or more minutes it was not moving.  It appeared to be hovering around an area we call top of the world, a small community 15 miles west of Globe, Az, in the mountains, very secluded area.  I judged the lights to be approx 15 to 20 miles away from where I was.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was a clear night with many stars visible.  I contacted our main gate dispatch center at 12:06 am and told our on duty dispatcher what I was observing.  She kinda laughed and told me earlier that night at approximately 08:30 pm she was texting with her daughter and her daughter (13 years old) said mom I see a ufo.  She told her daughter yea right but she said her daughter told her she was being serious.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Now getting back to what I seen.  After the call to my dispatch (I was inside of my vehicle when I made the call), I went back out and was still observing this object still not moving lights flickering and contacted my partner at 12:09 and told him what I was observing.  He was approximately 5 miles away and told me he could see the lights also.  He said he was going to drive about 3 miles west of my location to try get a better view.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At approximately 12:11am, I noticed what appeared to be 3 helicopters on flying below, on above and one in front fly by the area of the first spotting and continued to fly south east towards the Pinal Mountains with the two in the rear flying a lot slower.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I got back in my vehicle to make another phone call to my partner and advised him if he seen the helicopters and he reported yes he did.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I exited my vehicle at approximately 12:15am, I noticed to object was gone, but when I looked off towards the north, northeast I noticed it again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At approximately 12:20 am my partner got to his location and said he did not have a visual on the object.  I was at a higher elevation from my vantage point and did have a visual on the object.  The 3 what appeared to be helicopters went off over the Pinals and out of site.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At approximately 12:27am, what appeared to be a forth helicopter was flying in the area of the first sighting but then I noticed the object to the northeast was gone.  It was very interesting to me that after this object was spotted a group of aircraft (I believe was helicopters due to how they were moving) were spotted in the area looking for &#34;something&#34;.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have been in the fire service for 25 years, and have a pretty good head on my shoulders and I know what I saw that night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My phone was at dispatch center charging and my company phone cannot take pictures due to the confidentiality of areas I work in.<n>

The lights were dim orange in color and equally spaced in a v-shape.  It looked like 4 or 5 lights on each side.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I also witnessed the object.  The v-shaped object proceeded overhead in a north direction over Santa Fe.  There was no noise associated with the object.  The night was dark as moonrise had not occurred.

If there were more I didn&#39;t have time to see them. I pulled off the road immediately and by the time I got out all three were gone.  They were not planes, there were no small flashing lights, the shapes remained consistent and did not get smaller or larger.  The sky is clear tonight and you can see many stars, but these were three times bigger than the brightest star, and if there were planes they should have still been visible overhead or flying in the opposite direction when I got out of my car.  I looked up many videos online from across the world and were exactly what I saw tonight, and this is the first time I&#39;ve ever seem anything like these.  I live near an airport and am very familiar with planes of all shapes and sizes, and what the lights look like.  Whatever these were, they were there plain as day and gone.  On my way back I also noted 3 helicopters flying in the direction I just came from.<n>

It was low in the sky and the brightness and a flash caught our attention.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I brought it to the attention of my grandsons.  Curiously we were in awe and then it appeared as two bright headlights, it looked like a “flying car”.  We laughed and likened it to a scene from Harry Potter; but then we realized what we were seeing was not normal.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The lights were too bright and too low in the sky—just above the tree line and no sound was heard.  As we drove closer, and we became diagonal we saw it was hovering and that it was a triangular object with three lights.  Unable to stop because of traffic we proceeded in the absolute knowledge that this was a UFO an aircraft that we were unfamiliar with.  No flashing red or green lights, no sound and way too close for comfort.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Since there are three witnesses, I would like to add my grandson proposed that it may have been three objects flying in formation.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Description of the backgrounds of the observers: Woman age 56; retired Counselor.

It must have been a few miles away.  The strange thing was that the object wasn&#39;t moving across the sky (like a plane would), but seemed to be fixed.  I could tell it wasn&#39;t a star because of the way it kind of morphed, going from solid to fireball shape, and because of the color being solid amber/white.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Luckily I had my camera with me and filmed the event.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The entire object, not just part of it, flashed a few times.  At one point, I reached down to look at my cell phone to check the time, and when I looked back, the object was gone.  I drove around the neighborhood trying to find it again, but it was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Here is a link to the video I uploaded on youtube:  http://youtu.be/FCA95u123XE<n>

The glowing/flashing colors seemed to originate from the bottom dome, radiating out from the center to the rim of the disk and around its circumference.  Along the disks edge it only showed as blue/green were as the center blurred all colors of the rainbow.  Long 100&#39; arms hung below and in front, curling and extending, moving like long worms and coiling like a snake, only visible by the radiating lights from the bottom of the disk.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It mostly sat over the Griffin/Sterling Creek area and no higher than Anderson Butte (~1/2 mile+ elevation above valley floor).<n> <n><n> <n><n> When it moved, it didn&#39;t seem like it was moving, but would suddenly appear closer/farther.  Would occasionally wobble on its axis, giving a better view of the disk&#39;s full shape.  Eventually drifted low and closer to the mountains, out of my view.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Woke up my mother to witness.  When both of our eyes had adjust well to the lighting, we both could clearly make out the legs/arms extending out from the bottom/center of the disk.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Also, awoke two friends by phone who both watched from their houses.  Confirming location, movement, size, color, duration.  But angles, light, fatigue and eye sight caused my mother and I to have the best view.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The legs are still freaking me out.<n>

But then it completely stopped and hovered for a few seconds and when it began to move again it projected 3 bright blue lights to the ground about as fast as lightning strikes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I tried to press record as soon as I could but my record function was not available.  On the third attempt it finally recorded and although not as clear in the video as in person obviously I recorded a disc shaped object with 2 huge spot lights with little bright blue lights hovering and flying around extremely fast.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was completely silent even when it would take off there was not a sound made.  It had the ability to stop on a dime and reverse directions, east to west and north to south with no actual turning.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There were 3 cars about 50 feet behind me in which one guy was standing out with his phone recording as well.  I did NOT get out of my car to go speak with the other witnesses due to being completely in shock and terrified at the same time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object itself was only what seemed to be 50 yards away from me and my recording point.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After a short while the object disappeared with no light tracers no sound just gone in the blink of an eye.  The fact that this object made not a single sound and was able to get from one point to the other so quickly was mind blowing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object it self was massive and way to large to be a model airplane in which the police department tried to make me believe nor do we as people have the technology to demonstrate what I seen nor projecting blue laser like beams to the ground as quick as a lightning bolt.<n>

I looked at many times in different locations and it was still there.  Seems to be a quarter to a half of the size of the moon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Had other people look at it and noticed the object.  It wasn&#39;t far out, the outside of the object was seen.  The red object seemed to be &#34;hiding&#34;, and isn&#39;t obvious in plain sight.  The time I observed this was around 30 minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object seemed to be imobile at the time of viewing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There might of been a small haze at the outline.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I searched sites about astronomy and astronomical calendars but found nothing like this.<n>

I walked out onto the balcony and saw the two objects she described.  They were constantly flashing different colors, some bright, some very dim.  The two objects looked as if to be playing with each other.  They would speed up, slow down to a hover, go vertical and do zigzags.  They were very far away to the North of Fair Oaks so I could not see the shape of the objects. I have never seen any aircraft that could move in this way, not even the new F-35.  At first I speculated it could be USAF doing tactical maneuvers in a way not seen before.  My girlfriend then told me that she, my aunt and cousin were seeing at least 5 of these lights maneuvering around.  I do not believe the military would practice in this way- many aircraft doing random maneuvers at night, nor do I believe any known aircraft can move at the velocities and trajectories I observed.  Girlfriend mentioned she watched some ! of them rise up vertically and then suddenly drop a long way before going back to a hover.  She also described seeing them multiply as if duplicating themselves.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There were no sounds.  After the objects disappeared, an airplane flew to the area and seemed to be investigating the air zone that the objects were in.  I could see that this was an airplane due to the type of flashing lights it had, as well as it&#39;s forward facing &#39;&#39;headlights&#39;&#39;.  After a few minutes investigating the area it flew back South East with the typical sound you would expect to hear from an airplane.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Rough estimate about 20 minutes activity before they dimmed out and the airplane arrived to seemingly investigate.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

From the back door I can see to the east and northeast.  I was on the phone while smoking and something caught my eye and I seen, a perfect strip of large green balls, about 20 of them in a straight line.  It was low, like maybe 1/4 mile high, about a quarter mile out and straight up, about 1/4 mile long.. extending from southwest to northeast.  They turned on like a light switch steady on, bright green, and then all blinked faster and faster until it was like a fast strobe then went out all together at the same time, and this whole thing happened in about 4 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was so low and close..  I came in and explained to who I was on the phone with what I seen, and said I had to get off the phone to call 911.  I called 911 and explained to them what I seen, the dispatch woman just listened then asked if I could be put on hold.. while I was on hold I seen about 4 bright white close to the ground flashes far out on the horizon in the northeast..  dispatch returned and before she said anything I told her now I&#39;m seeing bright flashes to the northeast.. she then said I needed to contact the akron canton regional airport.. and I asked if she had a number, which she couldn&#39;t supply me.. so I didnt bother calling because I doubt id get anything but a help desk.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I called who I was talking to before calling 911, they live north east from me, and they seen the flashes also.  I checked online with aep (american electric power) they have an outage map, and here in stark county 501-2000 were without power in this county.. and the ufo was about 7 minutes before transformers blew out north east from here.  And I believe the ufo was the cause of the power outage.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was mostly clear out, and I could see the stars.. hardly any wind.  The string of green orbs didnt move, they were still.. its like they appeared, then went off.. it was way too close to the ground and it couldnt be anything explainable.<n> <n><n> <n><n> No sound, no booms, just there, then gone.  I dont know if it was 15 to 20 different objects or one solid object, i seen no outline, but it was perfect execution of them all on at the same time, all start strobing at the same time, and all out at the same time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> And im in a residential area.. and I dont think I was the only one to see it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What i wonder is if there is an explainable reason for the power outage part, but it seems too much of a coincidence to me.  It wasnt neat seeing this.. it was scary, if I could take it back I would.  It was too close to my house and too low.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have proof on my phone when I called 911, I have nothing else. . but like I said about the power outage must be a part of it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I left a voice mail on the hotline number.. I would be happy to talk to someone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((ADDENDUM FROM WITNESS))<n> <n><n> <n><n> Massillon secondary report 20 green lights and power outage.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Follow up on my report, I contacted the massillon independent and the American Electric Power Company (AEP) I spoke to a woman in the news department.  I dont remember her name, she said no one has reported anything and it was the first she heard.  She said she wrote the info down and will hold onto it if anyone else calls.  She also said maybe it was a plane... so whats the point in talking to her, she isnt going to make any mention of it in the newspaper.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I called AEP, and didnt say I seen anything, just requested information on the outage.  She said it happened about 9:30 pm which is in line when I was on the phone with police and seen flashes after the ufo.<n> <n><n> <n><n> She said it doesn&#39;t say in her system the cause of the event (ie: a squirrel) she said maybe something &#34;hit&#34; the line.  An insulator blew out and some other part with it I don&#39;t remember what its called.  At 3am when I went to bed aeps website stated the power was still out..  That&#39;s 5 and 1/2 hours later, I dont know when it was restored, but thats a long time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> If it matters, searching google a mufon report comes up from feb 3, 2014.  20 lights in the sky moving of a different color in massillon ohio.  Mufon case number listed as 53907. Sounds similar, except the color and the fact that it was moving at high speed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I did my job reporting this, contacting the police, news paper, and power company..  I&#39;m not an investigator, and I dont care to be known to any newspaper because nothing good will come  of doing so.  I let it be known something was here, and someone seen it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was from outer space without a question, and I&#39;m unnerved why it was even here and what made them decide to flash lights and knock out power.  Didn&#39;t seem welcoming, it was a small attack.<n> <n><n> <n><n> One last thing about aep power, she said the power outage was North Canton, and didn&#39;t specify exactly what sub station or poles.<n>

I looked out onto my fourth floor balcony and could see nothing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then in the distance I thought I saw an airplane with a green light on one wing and a red light on the other wing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What I thought was the plane was on the horizon where I would generally find other airplanes.  However, it came toward me, and as it did I saw it closer up and realized it was more like a sphere with a ring or disc spinning around the outside.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It didn&#39;t stay long and I believe went south.

Approx. 4:15 with Non commercial planes following within 30 min.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I live approximately 60 miles from the coast and 90 miles south of Los Angeles.  I see aircraft that take off from San Diego and Orange County and head east.  They reach an altitude over my house about 15-20k ft. I also see a lot of government planes that fly over heading east that are roughly about 30-50k ft with chemtrails.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This particular object was east of my location and moving in all directions for about 10 minutes.  Then it stayed stationary for about 15 minutes.  It appeared to be at the height of somewhere around 30-60k ft in the air.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then the object appeared to move west and all of a sudden I saw what appeared to be a smoke cloud.  It then started to move east and when I heard a jet coming over me and it disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The jet seemed to be about 40-50k ft in the air with a chemtrail.  I know this because all flights heading east from airports around me cannot get to this altitude in such a short distance.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then for another 30 minutes I saw 3 jets fly over in the area I last saw the object flying higher than a commercial jet.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Flights coming from Hawaii typically land in LA or Orange County.  A jet flying over me east at that altitude has to be on a continual path from west which doesn&#39;t make sense, since the hubs are LA or SD.  Validation from another source would be helpful.<n>

3/18/14 10:10|Piscataway|NJ|Oval|20 seconds|Oval shaped metal object seen following a wide-body aircraft and then disappearing with it at the same moment.|3/21/14|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/107/S107969.html|254|ndxe201403| Oval shaped metal object seen following a wide-body aircraft and then disappearing with it at the same moment<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had just arrived in the parking lot of a corporate building where I go to school every day.  I was finishing a cigarette before exiting the car, when I looked out my window--driver&#39;s side--I saw an airplane at what seemed like a great altitude, and trailing behind it at a short distance was an oval-shaped object.  When I scaled it down to a drawing--since I missed the photo/video opportunity--they were about 1 inch or 1 &amp; 1/2 inches apart.  I&#39;m not sure how far apart that would mean they were actually in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They were traveling at the same speed.  The oval object was most definitely shiny and silver metallic.  I could tell that the airplane was a solid-white, white-body aircraft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I saw no logos or other coloration that could indicate what airline this plane was.  Being that I live in NJ which has a few major airports nearby,  I see planes taking off and landing and flying at all kinds of various altitudes.  Often times when they are low enough (probably mid-descent) I can look up and see what airline it is based off the colors or any logos I&#39;m able to see.  Anyway, the airplane flew with the unidentified oval object for about 20 seconds, until they both disappeared behind the same tiny cloud.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was a mostly clear day with only a few tiny clouds in the sky surrounding the area in which I saw this occur.  I had actually during this time seen them go behind a cloud together and was able to watch them come out the other side...Until they disappeared behind one of them, so I got out of my car and looked around to try and relocate the objects, which I think given the lack of any serious cloud cover, i should have been able to do.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My only explanation for this is that when they went behind the cloud they maybe might have made a hard turn to their right and away from me (they were traveling horizontally across my view from right to left.  I wrote down the latitude and longitude and the degrees north &amp; north/northwest that I began to view the object and when I lost it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> If anyone else has seen! this I will be willing to release that information to them in order to coordinate  and create a clearer picture and maybe figure out what it was.  I was very, very shaken by what I saw; especially in the midst of the Flight 370 drama.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I did not sleep that night and therefore was unable to go to my classes the next day.  In the research I&#39;ve done since this occurred, other than it being an extraterrestrial, I have eliminated aeromagnetic surveying as what it was through images and descriptions (and the fact that it&#39;s done with smaller aircraft and the object that does the surveying is actually physically attached to the plane... and not an oval.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The only earthly explanation I can come up with is that this was an unmanned stealth drone in the skies above a very densely populated, urban area.  Frankly, this idea terrifies me much more than aliens.  In my heart, I kind of doubt this. because the edges seemed rather clear to me, that it was an oval about the same girth as the airplane it followed.<n>

The alien was white or a tannish color rounder shaped oval head.  It had the typical alien nose but the mouth was bigger and wider.  I was paralyzed but could only move my eyes and also there was one behind me because I was laying on my side rocking me back and forth.  I was trying to break free but could not move and then wend fully unconscious.  I do remember being levitated and pulled or dragged out of my bed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The next day I went downstairs and asked my nephew did he sleep ok that night.  He said to me unc I could hardly sleep there was this giggi diggi di sound going on and I thought! it was the radio.

As it came closer I realized it wasn&#39;t anything that I&#39;ve ever seen before.  It moved laterally through the sky at a fast pace at about a helicopter&#39;s height in the sky and then it hovered over my house, stopped, went back a bit, went forward a bit, then went up higher and higher and got darker and darker.  Then the light went out but I could still see something there, way up in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The larger darker object stayed stagnant for about 20 seconds, moved forward slowly at first and then it went toward the northwest at a much faster pace than before and traveled across the sky till I couldn&#39;t see it anymore because of the distance.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This thing was pretty huge for me to see it clearly fly across the sky with no illumination.  To me it looked black and long, maybe cylinder or rectangle-shaped but hard to tell since it was so dark in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My stupid phone is so cheap I couldn&#39;t get any good shots of it.  I have two pictures but they are very small and I need a usb cord to retrieve them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I realized later that the fireball was flying in virtually the same path the military jets take when they fly over our house.  I&#39;m in NW Fresno, CA, and they usually come from the east and fly northwest.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The sky was nice and bright and clear with an almost full moon.  It was really big, whatever it was.  It had no trail, it was silent, and appeared to be lower than an airplane until it stopped and went higher.  It definitely wasn&#39;t any kind of weather balloon or anything I&#39;ve ever seen before.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The sky was clear with an almost full moon.

It was an invisible rectangle centre with four very large lights on the bottom of each point of rectangle yet the lights did not illuminate the centre.  There was just a very faint indication that there was something solid in the centre.  The lights did not cast any beam of light downwards.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The craft seemed to be huge it was flying very low but not making a sound.  It was not travelling very fast and was travelling in the opposite direction from where I had first sighted it.  It was flying very low.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I stopped my car at the corner of two streets to watch it glide above me.  Never made a sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The large four lights would each be approximately a quarter the size of the interior space and they were at the bottom of the aircraft not the side but directly beneath it.<n>

I live in Hayden and it was towards the west, near the prairie towards Post Falls.  It moved upwards at a steady, consistant pace.  It paused, moved back down, paused, moved back up, paused again, then moved to the right.  It paused for the last time and then instantly dropped out of the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At 12:43, another bright red light descended at a steady, slow speed and then quickly changed pace and dropped out of site.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At the time of the sightings, the sky was fairly clear, but quickly following the sightings came a thicker cloud cover, originating from the area where the lights were seen.<n>

At first I thought it was someone shooting fireworks, because it was red/reddish light with a slight streak upwards, but there was no bang.  No sound at all.  The object was hanging in the air at high altitude but below the clouds, it seems.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was a solid blue glowing for a few minutes.  It then started strobing and changing colors. The colors were blue, red and white.  After 6 minutes it started descending again, but the lights were super bright white.  When I looked with binoculars it hurt my eyes.  I was not able to stare at it like a normal object for more then a few seconds at a time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have taken video on my phone for 6 min 17 sec.  My wife also saw it and described that it was flashing red, white and blue.  She then got scared and went inside, leaving me there to film the remaining few minutes.  The object went down from where it came up from.  The descent was eerie and slow, with super white lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I lost it behind the tree line and homes behind my house.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

It moved slowly and silently just above the tree line.  At one point it stopped as if to decide on a new course, as soon as speculation of what it could be began there was the distinct sound of helicopters.  The helicopter flew in my range of sight at tremendous speed, it had its search lights on, but pointed straight ahead rather than at the ground, it also had a large green light on its side, which I initially thought were navigation lights.  the sudden appearance of the helicopter drew my eye away from the orb, when I looked back in the direction I&#39;d last seen it there was nothing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have grown up here, sandwiched between the international airport and the air force base, however what I witnessed this night did not remotely resemble any craft ive seen prior.<n>
3/15/14 23:00|Davie|FL|Light|60 seconds|Amber lights over I-75...definitely not an aircraft on approach.|3/18/14|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/107/S107880.html|284|ndxe201403| Amber lights over I-75...definitely not an aircraft on approach.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My wife and I were returning home from dinner after briefly stopping at the gas station down the block from my home at approximately 11pm EST.  After leaving the gas station, as we were crossing the overpass that runs over I-75 (State Road 84 between Weston Road and 148th Ave.)  I looked to the right and in the sky I saw 5 (or 6 not sure now) orange/amber colored lights floating in the air.  They weren&#39;t low enough to make out a definite shape.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;ve always been a star gazer so I&#39;m very familiar with the skies around my home.  I live on the approach path to Fort Lauderdale International Airport and I&#39;ve been travelling on airplanes for work for the last 15 years.  I can confidently say I know what airplanes look like on approach and the light configurations you&#39;ll see from the ground.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What struck me about this sighting were a few things...<n> <n><n> <n><n> 1.	  They were not moving towards the airport.  When I first spotted them they seemed to be stationary, but as I changed direction on the road on my way home I realized they were actually moving towards the north.  My original perspective was north of them, so they appeared to not be moving for the few moments I was at that perspective.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 2.	  They were only one color, orange/amber.  I have 16/20 vision and I didn&#39;t see any other colors.  I can always see the red flashing lights on airplanes whether on approach or very high in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 3.	These objects were definitely within our atmosphere.  I could see stars behind them and they appeared, as usual, far away.  These appeared to be no more than 10,000 feet in the air.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 4.	I assumed they weren&#39;t military craft because they weren&#39;t flying in formation.  There was a lack of night time lights, like commercial craft, and there was a definite lack of a jet engine sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> All of the objects were basically in a straight line from the northern perspective.  I&#39;ve attempted to create a diagram below using numbers 1-5 to represent each object from left to right.  In case the diagram doesn&#39;t copy well.  Objects 1, 2 and 5 were basically in a straight line, although 5 seemed to be a degree or two  higher than 1 and 2.  Object 3 was directly below 2, and object 4 was slightly lower than 2 and 5 (think Orion&#39;s belt).<n> <n><n> <n><n> -1-                                                    -2-                                                                                                  -5- 								-4-   			              -3-<n> <n><n> <n><n> When my perspective changed to a westerly direction, they were all moving to the north (right).  Please remember I was the passenger in a moving vehicle on a &#34;S&#34; curve.  So my westerly perspective changed to a curving southern direction after about 5 seconds of moving west.  It was obviously difficult to properly assess the speed of all objects simultaneously due to their distance from each other.  I was concentrating mostly on objects 1-3, since object 5 was already almost out of site to the north.  Objects 4 and 5 appeared to be moving at the same speed.  Object 2 was accelerating faster than 4 and 5, 3 was barely moving and 1 was moving slowly or had just started to accelerate.  I would say object 2 was moving the fastest, but it&#39;s really difficult to compare it anything.  Was it moving faster than a plane at that altitude?  I can&#39;t say because there was no point of reference but the stars and one other plane on approach to FLL.<n> <n><n> <n><n> And because of the plane I can definitely say it wasn&#39;t a commercial plane.  The color of the objects appeared to be the same color as HID street lamps.  That orange glow you get from High Pressure Sodium bulbs.<n> <n><n> <n><n> If this sighting sounds like something worth investigating; I would be willing to draw a diagram.  The event is clear in mind and I doubt will diminish for quite some time.  It was definitely out of the ordinary and unexplainable from my experiences to-date.<n>

I&#39;m really glad that I decided to write down what I saw last night as it was happening...  I couldn&#39;t get good pics or video &amp; wanted to make sure I was actually seeing what I saw...  So, I just kind of started writing out what I was seeing &amp; doing just to know I would remember this night!<n> <n><n> <n><n> Later, I tried talking myself out of what I saw throughout the night, &amp; next morning, but I&#39;m sure what I saw was real &amp; when I read my description from last night, I realized that I can&#39;t talk myself out of it anymore...<n> <n><n> <n><n> So I&#39;m submitting my notes from last night that describe the entire event.  It&#39;s mostly chronological so it&#39;s how it was unfolding.  I left it all in, even a few of my personal feelings about some of the things going on.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I started writing about 5 minutes after I first saw the UFO&#39;s in the sky.  At about 12:15pm, yesterday on Friday night, March 14, 2014:  - Seeing a fleet of UFO&#39;s fly over my house right now!  Omg!  They look like seeing tiny stars or satellites.  Like when watching a satellite from space go thru the sky, except not blinking or twinkling, just solid.  There are WAY too many to be a satellite or even a group of satellites...even if somehow all these satellites could be up there at once.  But I&#39;ve never seen anything like this before!  I was looking up at the sky tonight while walking my dog.  I walk my dog every night &amp; I like to &#34;sky watch&#34; while I walk.  I was staring at what I think was Jupiter because I was thinking how big &amp; red the &#34;Star&#34; looked, &amp; when I realized it wasn&#39;t twinkling I figured it must be a planet...<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then I noticed that some of the stars were moving!  I had to do a double take &amp; then said those are really moving!!  All white in color like a &#34;white star&#34; looks &amp; they are all the same exact size of a small star &amp; about as bright.  At first I saw about 5-7 &amp; then more.  Then I&#39;d see only a few, then 10-20 or so more staggered thru...  A lot of them are flying exactly parallel with another one (craft/light).  But not all of them do.  They are flying kind of slowly &amp; are staying around the same pace, but not all in one group.  They are all over this section of sky near the moon, but not in other areas of the sky...<n> <n><n> <n><n> I can see them through the clouds &amp; above/below them as well.  I can also see them when there are no cloud in the sky bear the moon.  They are all flying across the sky near the moon going from what I think to be East - West but it looks like they are going towards the PDX airport which is South of Vancouver.  I will have to confirm the directions I am looking.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They are going very slowly across the sky still.  They are flying with no trails of light, contrails or any other obvious features.  Since I couldn&#39;t get my husband to come &amp; look (he was sleeping) I am desperate to have somebody witness what I am seeing!  First, I just called my mom to see if she could see what I was seeing, but she said she couldn&#39;t see anything, which I kind of figured because she&#39;s across town.  Then I decided to call 911... I felt kind of stupid after I started telling him about what I&#39;m seeing!  Like I said &#34;sorry!  I&#39;m not sure what I thought you could do for me!&#34;  Lol...<n> <n><n> <n><n> At that point I asked, but he hadn&#39;t gotten any other calls about anything strange in the sky, but he did give me the State UFO hotline phone #, which was really nice of him &amp; that made me feel better, lol...<n> <n><n> <n><n> So I called &amp; I left a message with the hotline he gave me &amp; I also called MUFON... I didn&#39;t get anyone live, but it was 1am!  I don&#39;t really expect anyone waiting by the phone!  I guess I just really want to tell someone what I&#39;m seeing!  It&#39;s frustrating to be seeing this alone!!  I&#39;ve tried to take pictures &amp; video but I can&#39;t see anything on the screens!  I think they are too small to see with my crappy camera...  I&#39;ll have to check later on my computer if any came out, but I only have my phone &amp; an older camcorder that was dead, so I got an extension cord &amp; drug it out the front window towards the front yard/driveway where I have been standing all night, so I could plug the camera in &amp; try to film something.  I couldn&#39;t zoom in on anything because the lights were very tiny like stars &amp; the moon was pretty full &amp; bright &amp; that&#39;s all my camera would focus on...  Argh!  This sucks!!  It&#39;s now 1:15am.  Been seeing them from around midnight till now, at least over an hour so far.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Reminds me of the videos you see on Youtube that show little fleets of tiny crafts flying &amp; zipping around the atmosphere, except these ones I see are much slower...  Kind of a cautious pace.  Not sure if each &#34;dot&#34; is singular or just visible lights on a larger ship that isn&#39;t completely visible....?  They keep coming pretty steadily...  By the end of this night I think there could be 50+ ships at the very least...<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;m sure I can&#39;t even see them all.  Can&#39;t seem to get them on camera but have to check the pics/vid later to be sure...<n> <n><n> <n><n> Can&#39;t get bobby to help me verify this... It really pisses me off!  How can you not want to come &amp; look if your wife tells you they see weird lights in the sky that you think could be UFO&#39;s?!  He said I must be seeing stars!  Yeah... ok Copernicus!  Stars don&#39;t move like that!  These are definitely not stars.  Not like I&#39;ve ever seen in my 31 years!  He&#39;s not really much into science or astronomy... things like that, but jeez! I love the night sky &amp; I watch it nightly... I am familiar with normal activity, but this wasn&#39;t normal at all...!  Tomorrow I will take pics of my area during the day in case anyone is wondering.  This is pretty much the biggest thing that&#39;s ever happened as far as something like this goes &amp; I really can&#39;t believe what I&#39;m seeing...even though it&#39;s right in front of me!  I&#39;ve always thought there was other life out there...  But seeing this is life changing! I&#39;ve been out here for about 2 hours watching the sky...<n> <n><n> <n><n> I can&#39;t imagine I&#39;d stare @ the sky for 3 hours for no reason...  It&#39;s cold out here too! I&#39;m chilled to the bone!  And I&#39;m 10 feet from my house!  Duh!  Go inside, lol!!  Just now about 1:30am now, while watching the sky I see an extra bright one paired with the reg. &#34;dimmer&#34; version that I have seen the whole time with it...  Haven&#39;t seen one this bright...! Then the 2 seemed to stop.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A plane was flying nearby with only reddish blinking lights &amp; a small dissipating contrail.  It flew &#34;by&#34; (not sure of actual distance) the stopped &#34;star crafts&#34; &amp; they didn&#39;t move...  At the same moment I started watching 3 others little reg. star crafts come in rather faster than normal.  One was even trying to catch up... then they seemed to stop as well...  Thats when the plane that kept flying by before, with the red lights, went by them just after they too had stopped - I thought maybe the crafts try &amp; disguise themselves as stars? They were directly over head... 1:41am.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So now I don&#39;t know what I&#39;m seeing... It is really weird! None of them had stopped before.  I tried staring at the 3 that stopped for a long time to see if they would &#34;move&#34; so I could believe that my eyes were just messing with me...  But they didn&#39;t budge.  I know what I saw. I even saw the last of the 3 trying to catch up with the other 2 before they stopped.  Same with the bright one &amp; the reg. one that I saw just before.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I clearly saw them move from out in the distance &amp; then stop.  But when I see them still there it&#39;s hard to say it was them, but maybe that&#39;s why they do it?  It&#39;s the only aspect of what I&#39;ve seen tonight that is hard to explain...  Aside from seeing UFO&#39;s in general of course!!  This is what I&#39;ve seen &amp; it really makes me wonder where they came from &amp; where they were headed....<n> <n><n> <n><n> (Completely sober tonight by the way...lol.)<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((ADDENDUM FROM WITNESS))<n>

There was a object at a far distance blinking white to red to white to red that was stationary.  It intermittently was obscured by cloud cover but it kept becoming visible again, however, it would appear in another area of the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At one point I checked &#34;what planes are above me&#34; on my IPhone and all it showed was one 737 in the sky at the particular time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We observed it in the sky in various locations for over 2 hours before we went to bed.  It was too far away to take picture which I tried on 2 cameras.  At one point my wife observed another light flying to the ship she described it looked like a &#34;firefly.&#34;<n>

Until last night,......... My bed room has a back door that leads outside onto a small roof around the back of the house, I use it when I&#39;m going to have a smoke.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A little after lighting my cigarette I noticed what appeared to be 4 white lights rotating in the sky, right within the clouds, the moon was out and it was bright so I could see the clouds very well, the lights seem to be rotating simultaneously two at a time in a circles motion, curious I was like, &#34;What the hell am I looking at,&#34; trying to figure out if the lights were coming from the ground up or not, but from what I could see they were not they were coming from above the cloud.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then just like that the lights rotated again into one but this time it was dead center and just ! diapered.  I stood there dumfounded not understanding what I just saw, but I do know what I saw.  Again I&#39;m not a big fan or believer in the UFO thing, but I do now this, &#34;I know what I saw.&#34;<n>

She called me to the window to see it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was several hundred yards up moving very slowly south east.  We also noticed that at least 15 to 20 aircraft at different time intervals all seeming to converge on the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At one point, an aircraft flew very low and fast over our residence toward the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We used binocular&#39;s to look at it.  It seemed triangular with blue, red, green, and white lights.  It moved very slowly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> While we were watching, another object appeared very similar to the first, but more to the east.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Both had the same lights and moved very slowly southeast.<n>
3/14/14 21:00|Gainesville|FL|Rectangle|2 minutes|The object hung suspended in the sky, a huge rectangle, at a diagonal angle.  Dark grey in color with dull green lights at the points.|3/18/14|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/107/S107867.html|307|ndxe201403| The object hung suspended in the sky, a huge rectangle, at a diagonal angle.  Dark grey in color with dull green lights at the points.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I go out running almost every night.  On this particular night, I was so hungry, I had a pretty decent sized sandwich a short while before going out.  This wasn&#39;t the best decision I&#39;ve ever made, but it lead to the sighting of this massive UFO.<n> <n><n> <n><n> During one portion of my run, my stomach cramps became too much.  I stopped at a bus stop bench to take some deep breaths.  After a few moments of sitting there, the street light beside the bench unexpectedly went out.  Jokingly, I saw this as a sign that I should continue walking.  I was near the University of Florida campus, walking right in front of the Law School Library, which is usually open 24 hours and always lit.  This building too was completely dark.  Finding this strange, I continued walking.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I walked forward along the sidewalk, a fairly small plane flew over head, but very close.  Closer than any plane I&#39;d seen flying before.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Again, I found this strange and as I continued walking I realized that I had seen numerous planes in the sky that night and had thought it weird.  Up until this point, I wasn&#39;t thinking anything supernatural, just that strange occurrences continued to happen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> To my left after the Law Library, is where the University has it&#39;s tennis courts.  All of the lights for the tennis court were on.  As I passed by they turned off at the same time, and at this point I started getting a little freaked out.  I began jogging again despite the pain in my stomach.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I continued forward along the road, there was a gap in the trees as I noticed something out of the corner of my eyes that I found strange. It could have been the wings of a plane, but they were diagonal in the sky, something you never see with planes, and it was much too large.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Intrigued, I stopped and looked at it straight on. It was a massive rectangle structure that looked as if it were completely thin. It was a dark gray color that made it hard to see it against the dark blue back drop of the sky. Around it&#39;s edges it was a darker black. On the points of the object, there were dull glowing green lights (which had added to my initial thought that it could have been airplane wings).<n> <n><n> <n><n> This thing was pretty low - lower than any aircraft (but not as low as the previous airplane I&#39;d seen that night), and it was diagonal against the sky. When I stopped to pay attention to it, it seemed as though it were moving toward me but when I made eye contact with the thing, it just stopped and hovered. Silently. I heard all the regular noises around me, but nothing came from this massive object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I watched it, it moved in such a strange motion, it&#39;s hard to describe with words. It didn&#39;t seem to have any dimension, but it moved as if it did. It kind of turned in on itself and turned toward another area of the sky and quite easily began to make it&#39;s way forward. In relation to the University of Florida campus, it was near the stadium.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It flew in the sky with the ease you would see a river flowing. It was so natural. There were some tree coverage so as it moved toward where I wouldn&#39;t be able to see it, I sprinted. I ran to another portion of the sidewalk with a clear view of the sky. But when I was finally able to see, the thing was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It had flown with a speed that I have never seen. With no noise. And it was an object that made no sense to be up in the sky like that. It could only have been an alien space craft or government weapon. Who knows.<n>

It will hang around and then after a few hours drop back down in the mountains.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There is also a time in January of 2011 where the entire areas power went out.

There was no green or red running lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The craft could not have been more than 1000 feet above us.  I heard nothing of it until it had passed over us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At that point, it made what I would call a light wushing sound.  It sounded more like the wush from a draft.

At first I figured it was a plane, but then the more I watched it the more intrigued I became and I had to stop and look closer.  It wasn&#39;t on the normal flight path that all the other planes come in at towards the PBI Airport and it was flying particularly slow.  The craft was also much higher in altitude than any of the planes and was heading directly west, then it suddenly vanished.  Afterwards I kept walking and a minute later I looked back in that direction only to see the craft again almost in the same location but now was heading directly south and picking up speed then vanished again. I then started walking at slow pace while still staring where the craft disappeared and between a minute or two minutes later it appeared again suddenly, a little further south of where I originally saw it the first two times and was moving very slowly west again and then quickly vanished once more.  Each time I saw the object it remained within sight for approximately five to ten seconds before vanishing.  And was it was difficult trying to see the shape of it as the light was reflecting off of it so strongly and it was at such a high altitude in the sky, but from what I could see it would have been in a more triangular shape. Twenty minutes after the sighting I saw three other regular airline planes heading on the normal flight path to the PBI Airport within five to ten minutes of each other, this helped me solidify what I saw with the craft and helped me make a better comparison as to how high the craft was in comparison to the planes.  I noticed however after all the descending planes going to the PBI Airport there was a fourth plane flying at a much higher altitude (not as high as the craft was) that was not descending but was flying west, and I wondered if it was following the craft or not.<n>

It did not seem to be moving and I would notice like a second light flickering occasionally.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I taped for a good while and decided to go get my binoculars and I headed to my back yard.  Throughout the taping you can see the sun rising and birds flying and traffic passing me by.  With the binoculars I could see what looked to be a very brilliant triangular shaped aluminum looking object and could see another object behind it connected by something.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The objects would seem to change shapes like from a triangular to cylinder or flat and shimmering.  Neither object had the same shape.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I video tapped until almost I think 9 am and stayed outside still observing this brilliant light in the sky.  Using my binoculars the object seemed to be going further away because it was getting smaller.  It did not go sideways st all just stayed what seemed to be stationary and only seemed to travel upwards in a very slow time.  Can be seen from my video.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I did take two pictures of the light after daylight came and I was almost finished taping cause my phone was dying.  Can send pictures but video is way too long to upload but very good details of bright light throughout the video.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We live close to refineries and this is nothing to do with them in any way.  Never seen anything like this in Mr my life.  And I have been traveling this same raid for over ten years.  The video is very good quality and pretty long to give hopefully some good details to whom ever can use it.  Thanks.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.  PD))<n>

I watched this blue light travel from (it almost looked like it was behind the star) the star to the left and at about a 40-45 degree angle towards the ground.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It traveled quickly for a few seconds, then it blinked out, and it was gone.  I thought I might have lost sight of it because of the tree branches that are in the way, but after getting a better view of that piece of sky, I could no longer see it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I took out my iPhone 4S and took a picture of the sky where it was, but unless you turn up the brightness the image is almost all black.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This morning I remarked a copy of that p! icture, this morning.  I have used MSPaint to draw the path of the UFO, the tree branches, the roof line, and the brightest stars that were visible with the naked eye.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I will send the remarked picture and the original with this report.  Granted this was not a spectacular UFO sighting, but it was strange to me because I live in the flight path of a few airports, DFW International Airport, Love Field, Alliance Airport, and Arlington Municipal Airport.  So I am very familiar with Airplanes in the sky and the paths they take over my home, (it&#39;s usually from North to South) and this UFO was not taking a normal path that I see other Airplanes take.<n>

They were travelling parallel to Katella Ave from about Beach Blvd. vicinity when I first noticed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I ran and got my binoculars and watched as they passed in front of me.  The copter was close to it, maybe 75 feet behind and slightly above it about 30 degrees.  I could see the copter.

The object flashed a red and blue light alternately from one end to the other, and appeared to be a disc shaped.  After I noticed the object in the sky I pulled over to the side of the road to get a clear view of it.  It was moving very slow and then it stopped and after 2-5 seconds slowly dissipated out of sight.  With the airport being a couple of miles away,  I waited and observed a few planes and helicopters to be sure what I had seen could not have been either.  What I had seen was quite surreal.<n>

The noise was extremely loud and continuous and when I went outside I saw a dark aircraft with numerous blinking lights (many more than an airplane) flying over my house toward to Flatiron Mountains.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was flying high enough that it eventually disappeared over the mountain, though it was pretty low to just go over the mountain top.  It came from the East and headed toward the West over the Flatiron Mountains.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I watched it pass over me for about a minute or so and the loud noise continued until it was no longer in sight and earshot.

Accompanied by Three Black Helicopters<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I finished up moving furniture for some family, I heard the distinct roar of choppers (helicopters) in the distance.  Being one to investigate late-night military craft (which I knew that they were); I sat outside on the steps, waiting for the choppers to pass.  About four and a half minutes into waiting, they broke from behind the tree line, and flew by the house.   They were blacked-out, say for the red lights on the noses of the aircraft.  As I stood to go back inside, my attention was drawn to huge white lights coming from behind the trees on the opposite side of my field of view.  I watched the lights emerge, and saw what I thought was a low-flying plane taking off from our local airport.  The craft moved quite slowly, and had three very bright white lights forming a perfect triangle.  The lights were very large to boot, almost touching one another.  I was able to make out another smaller white light in the centre of the three, as well as a slowly bli! nking red light on the plane opposite of the craft’s direction of movement (i.e. a taillight).  I was able to see a black body around the lights.  The craft disappeared behind tree cover, and never attained significant elevation.   Both the choppers and the unidentified craft headed in the same direction; east, towards downtown Cary.  It was only later that I realised that both the choppers and the craft came from the west of us, nowhere near the airport, which is north and east by a long shot.  The craft originated from the vicinity of Jordan Lake.  The next day, my boss said that he too heard choppers near his house in Wake Forest, sometime around 23:15.  He saw nothing, though.<n>

I would have thought it was a meteor, but there was no fireball.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The weather was clear, and the moon was half full.  I noticed no airplanes in the sky at the time.

3/10/14 21:00|Cook|MN|Light|~1 minute|Saw three large, bright red-orange spheres of light in the southeastern sky.|3/18/14|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/107/S107842.html|351|ndxe201403| Saw three large, bright red-orange spheres of light in the southeastern sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At approximately 9:00 pm on the night of March 10, 2014, I stepped outside of my driveway to take my dog for his nightly walk.  I immediately noticed a large, bright red-orange light in the southeastern sky, well above the treeline on the opposite side of the open hay field that is across the road from my driveway.  It was definitely unusual and bright and caught my attention right away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first I thought it must be an airplane (small craft judging by the size, brightness, and proximity to the tree line), but the light did not blink or flash, nor move in any direction.  It just sat there.  I was checking it out for about 30 seconds, trying to figure out what it could be, when all of a sudden, it disappeared, sort of blinked off.  I thought it must be a plane banking and taking a turn and that the light just became temporarily undiscernible.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Within seconds of it disappearing, a second large, bright red-orange light suddenly appeared in the southeastern sky! , but way more north of the original light.  I was checking out that second light just “hanging” there for a few seconds before the first light reappeared in the direction I had originally seen it in.  So I was watching both of those lights when a third large, bright red-orange light appeared in close proximity to the first light, but appeared to be a little more westerly (i.e. more my direction) than the first two lights.  Now there were three large, bright, red-orange lights hanging, unmoving, not blinking or flashing, in the sky all at the same time.  I watched them for approximately 15 seconds or so before all three of them disappeared all at once at the same time.  Even from the first moment I saw the first light in the sky, I wanted to go get my boyfriend, who was in the house, so that he could see what I was seeing.  But I didn’t want to miss anything.  After the lights disappeared, I continued searching that part of the sky, but no lights reappeared, so I continued ! on my way with walking my dog.  During the entire walk (about ! 15-20 mi nutes), I kept my eye on that part of the sky where I saw the lights because I was so fascinated by what I had just seen!  After walking about 10 minutes, I was heading back to my house when I saw the lights reappear in that same part of the southeastern sky.  This time, however, I saw only two of them, but they were side by side, and appeared to be either attached to the same craft, or flying in formation.  I saw them for only about 3-5 seconds that time, they disappeared, and then I never saw them again.  To clarify:  The lights were very large (about the size of a dime? from my vantage point, guess I could say more of an orb or sphere than simply a point of light); appeared above the treeline, but apparently further distant than the treeline; were a clear, bright red-orange color; did not blink, flash, or change position other than to disappear and then reappear over moments of time; and were silent (i.e. I heard no aircraft at anytime during the entire time I was outside! that night).<n>

Rd. 49, crossing Britton Bridge over Cedar Creek , with my daughter, I saw a white/silver, cylindrical object that appeared to be hovering stationary in the sky well above the tree line, about seven fingers from the horizon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Finding a place to pull over and stop the car, I watched as this elongated object moved slowly from general west.  It moved to slow to be an airplane and there was no sound emitted as jets and planes make (even when they are not visible).  In fact, during this time I neither heard nor saw any known air crafts.  Also, there was not a cloud in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I watched for perhaps three to four minutes as it moved in a lazy fashion across the sky for at least six hand widths at arms length. I had time to notice that it did not taper to a near point at either end (as planes and helicopters do) but instead was rounded.  Not a &#34;hard&#34; semi-circle round, but a softer &#34;hill&#34; type round.  It also appeared to be long, (like a stretched blimp maybe), as well as narrow, (like a used up, shortened pencil).<n> <n><n> <n><n> I continued watching it travel eastward and in the blink of an eye, below this object and to the left, another object appeared suddenly.  It too was elongated and white in color. Only the ends of the second object appeared to be flat and it moved from east to west.  It too moved slowly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They both appeared to be large and a good distance away.  I would estimate their angle of elevation to be around 45 degrees or a little less.<n>

During the 1st several seconds, I perceived more of a motion than a point of light, until I saw what seemed like a shapeless small cloud in this pre-dawn sky, moving more rapidly, toward just North of due West.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When nearly overhead at its zenith, just south of straight overhead, I saw a hazy oval shape that nearly blended with the dawn sky color of maybe dark slate gray, except there were 4 blurry light sources on bottom of the shape, fore and aft, left and right.  There was no sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At arm’s length, this lozenge-shaped object was about the size of the 1st joint on the thumb.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There were no clouds in the sky, and checking weather sites, this was confirmed.<n>

We went back into the porch, and even our cats seemed to be upset over the noise.  The sound was very loud and overpowering, it sounded similar to a strong violent windstorm with the following sounds coming from inside it: large vacuum cleaner, heavy rotating machinery, electrical humming or buzzing.  The sound was all around us but coming from above, our first instinct was to look towards the sky, but the sky was clear.  Then we tried to make sense of it, the loudness of it should have caused vibrations in the ground but there were none, we felt like we should take cover from the wind but it was calm and still.  It lasted for about an hour and a half, give or take, and then suddenly came to an immediate stop.<n> <n><n> <n><n> During the time the sound was active, the sound would fade in and out.  We were surprised once it ended that our neighbors were not woken by the noise and outside wondering the same things we were.  This was not the first time this has happened, we experienced the same exact thing a few months ago.  The first experience was not as loud and disruptive as the second.  The day after the first experience, I logged into my Facebook to check my Facebook feed and catch up with friends, when I noticed a post that my cousin in Ohio had made.  She had complained about a “loud giant vacuum like noise” that had kept her up most of the night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Her post was made about an hour or so after we heard the noise at our house.  Maybe a coincidence, but I personally have become a UFO believer since the recent experiences I’ve had.<n> <n><n> <n><n> During the second experience, my boyfriend had captured video of the sound, and video of what it sounded like after the sound had stopped.<n>

I instinctively looked out the south window because that is area ive seen strange lights &amp; objects in the sky before.  I seen a single triangle shaped craft approximately 350yrds from my home slowly rising up from the field.  The redish yellow lights were slowly flashing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I asked my wife to come witness this &amp; she made the comment of having a harsh metal taste in her mouth.  My two dogs were acting very franrtic &amp; scratching  at the front  door.  As the craft lifted slowly into the sky the house was pulsating or vibrating.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The craft lifted to approximately 500ft. the lights on the craft went dark &amp; with a slight boom sound it was gone.  I assume it went in the direction the craft was pointing in which was south.  I have reported this activity twice before to this web site with no results.  Should i lie &amp; say i seen little green people running around in my yard so it sounds more believable ?  Sorry if the truth is boring &amp; i will not doctor it up to make it more appealing !<n>

It was approximately 12:30 am the morning of March 10, 2014.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I drove along I gazed out my driver side window and noticed an orange fire ball like object with a green tail as though a huge roman candle had been lit in space and aimed downwards to earth.  It was just above the tree tops.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I looked at the road ahead and looked back really quick to see it had fallen below the tree lines by then and much larger than before. It was a lot closer to me by this time as though we were about to meet.  My heart sank, I blinked and it just vanished as if it &#34;went out&#34;.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I pulled over onto the side of the road to investigate somewhat but there wasn&#39;t anything burning or on fire.

It was 8pm and darkness obscured the fact that it was fairly cloudy.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I saw four yellow/orange lights 45 degrees up from me.  The color of the lights was immediately perplexing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This area is a well-used flight path for the busy Minneapolis airport and is about 7 miles from there.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The lights I saw were about the color of sodium streetlights and solid - no strobing like one sees with commercial aircraft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> All 4 lights were slowly traveling west to east with little deviation from their path.  A single non-pulsing yellow/orange light was following a considerable distance behind the three other lights that when I first saw them were in a triangular pattern.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was hard to ascertain their altitude as it was night.  Most of my attention was on the group of three lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I watched the lights the shape of the formation changed.  The light in the back moved closer to the two front lights and the triangle turned more into a straight line.  All the while, the fourth light kept considerable distance.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The intensity and color of all four lights was constant throughout my observation.  At one point, a commercial aircraft bound to land at MSP was headed close to the formation and from my vantage point almost crossed paths.  It is hard to imagine that pilot would not have seen the formation.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Eventually, the four lights passed almost out of my field of vision so I attempted to follow them to the east, but there was no road that would take me in that direction and I was never able to track them again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In all, I saw the lights for about 2 minutes and got one minute of video on my cell phone including the time that the plane appeared the nearly cross paths with the lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am not quite sure what I saw and neither are the people who watched my video.<n>

I live on the flight path to Char/Doug airport and have seen &#39;airplanes&#39; that are not real - ie. they are morphing in and out of orb-like shapes into what most would think are real aircraft.  (Differences for me are very apparent between a real airplane &amp; the ET variety)<n> <n><n> <n><n> Also, there are red light areas (one behind my house, where a new road is under construction, and other red light area somewhere in front of my house (not directly in front, maybe a few miles away).  I believe these red light areas are the &#39;main&#39; craft locations, whereby, people are being taken to in order to get probed/chipped etc.. - im sorry if this sounds weird).<n> <n><n> <n><n> My daughter has been having vivid dreams as of late, as well as unexplained marks on her body (left hand predominant).  Also, my son has woken up numerous times with nose bleeds, and most recently, red lumps on his ear lobes.  He also had a mark on his left hand that he was unaware of doing anything in order to cause it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have seen flashes of light, and flashes of dark &amp; flashes of visions that are so surreal that i am afraid to tell anyone for fear of being institutionalized.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is real, i have videos.  And something is going to happen on April 6th..... I dont know wot as yet, maybe ufos will be disclosed by govmt, maybe ison will hit the Mediterranean, or else China will attack.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Sorry again for all this, that may or may not make sense.......<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.

At 11:00pm was when we first had contact with the two orbs of light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> For about 5 seconds we watched in awe and amazment. I then reached in my pocket and started recording with my phone.  The two orbs of light were perfectly side by side and moving vertically at a fast pace.  16 seconds into the video the lights start to fade.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Shortly after that they fully disappeared.  You can only hear the sound of something once it is over head and nothing once fully gone.  Futhermore there were no blue and red lights to indicate any kind of aircraft.<n>
3/8/14 23:55|Birmingham (UK/Birmingham)||Triangle|5 seconds|Two elongated triangle shaped craft, no noise or lights,one behind the other, Birmingham, England. March 8 2014.|3/18/14|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/107/S107792.html|391|ndxe201403| Two elongated triangle shaped craft,no noise or lights, one behind the other, Birmingham, England. March 8 2014<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was looking up at the night sky looking at a group of stars called in laymans terms the Saucepan which is a group of 7 stars.  The sky was clear with various thin,broken clouds when 2 triangular shaped objects appeared.  They were traveling in a northerly direction one behind the other.  Speed, height and size was hard to gauge as there was nothing in the sky to compare them to.  My best guess as to the speed would be faster than a commercial aircraft at cruising altitude but not as fast as a shooting star.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I live underneath one of the North Atlantic approach routes into London Heathrow.  The aircraft that I see overhead are usually at a flight level of around 26000 feet, these craft did not appear to be that high and appeared to slightly higher than the broken cloud base and you could still see them as they passed through the cloud.<n> <n><n> <n><n> If they were flying at around 5000 feet then I would estimate them to be the size of a Boeing 737 and traveling at a speed of around 500 m! ph.  There was no sound evident and no vapour type trail.  The shape of the craft was that of a slightly elongated triangle,rounded at the 3 points.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Neither of the craft had any lights and the best way that I can describe their colour would be a smokey grey/milky colour.  They both continued in a northbound direction,the rear craft flying at around the distance of 1 crafts length behind and seemingly at the same height and disappeared in to thicker cloud.  All of this observation lasted around 4-5 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have been an avid aircraft enthusiast/spotter for the last 45years and know what an aircraft looks like in flight whether it be private, commercial or military irrespective of how high they are flying.  Where I live the aircraft on approach to London are at a height of around 26000 feet but can still be heard in the sky quite clearly,as do the other aircraft which pass overhead on their way to Europe at flght levels of around 33000-35000 feet.  These 2 craft were not audible at all.<n>

I pointed out the window and said, &#34;Look way out there... Are those jets?&#34;  They literally looked like 6 planes (bright lights) all lined up in order to land at the salt lake airport.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My wife saw them and said, &#34;Yea, those look like planes lined up to land somewhere&#34;  They look like the handle of a soup ladle.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Well this went on for some 15 minutes before we realized they hadn&#39;t moved at all.  Then in between the gaps of the lights, another light would appear the same time as another would disappear.   So it was hard to determine if there were 6 lights lined up or 7 lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Every few minutes the shape of the line would move around like they were lights hooked to a string.

I heard no noise though!  It was close enough that I should have heard SOMETHING.  My husband is a police officer and was working at the time.  I immediately called him to make sure everything was alright, why was there a helicopter hovering in the middle of the night?  He knew nothing about it.  He did ask me how many glasses of wine I had (zero).  He told me he would come to the house and check it out, but never did.  After I hung up with him, I woke up my 11 year old son who happens to be on a UFO kick right now.  We looked at it together for a few minutes and then went back to bed (both in my bed this time because he was scared).<n> <n><n> <n><n> I got up a little while later to look out the window and it had moved significantly farther away.  I looked again a little later after that and it was gone.  I have cell phone video of the object.  My husband suggested that it was possibly a helicopter doing surevelance, but really?  With a glowing red light on?  The only light was the red one.  No white, no blue, no green.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When the red light pulsates off, it was black.<n>

Here’s how it|3/18/14|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/107/S107748.html|432|ndxe201403| re:  Anomaly in Sky over Bartonsville, PA - Afternoon of March 6th, 2014.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Natural Light Phenomenon or UFO?  Okay . . . Here’s how it went.  On the afternoon of Thursday, March 6, 2014, at 3:45 p.m., here in Bartonsville, Pennsylvania, I was on the rear enclosed sun porch making some close-up JPG pictures of old silver dollar coins.  It’s good and bright out there in the afternoon so natural light is all that’s needed.  The now antiquated Nikon D1H digital SLR somehow seems to make sharper close on pictures than the later model D2HS camera with much improved light sensor computer system.<n> <n><n> <n><n> While working there making close-up photos with the D1H, I happened to glance out the window to the southwest and noticed in the mostly blue skies, numerous plane contrails.  It was first pondered as to what might be going on to get so much weekday afternoon apparent military jet activity.  Looking up again towards our now broken whirlee-gig windmill that&#39;s atop the rear deck upper railing, a blotch of rainbow colored light was seen shining from behind an odd wispy rippled cloud.  That was about 3:48 p.m. with the afternoon sun getting lower over in the west.  It seemed then as if the sun was maybe shinning into the cloud at a precise angle and reflecting ice crystals making the rainbow colors.  I took the old D1 camera and strolled out onto an ice free area of the back deck to make a couple of pictures.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About the same time, the light from within the cloud became very bright as if something shiny was up there reflecting the sunlight. Noticed then was a trail of what appeared to be exhaust smoke or maybe vapor in the form of small puffy clouds.  It was then realized that what was being seen was NOT a rainbow but something else.  After clicking a couple of more pictures it was noticed that the battery on the D1 camera was getting low.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I returned inside the house and grabbed the Nikon D2HS camera with fully charged battery and big memory card with 2.1K remaining picture slots.  By the time I got back outside the bright light in the sky had faded along with most of that unusual wispy mackerel skin cloud having disappeared.  It was realized then that the mask like cloud was somehow related to the hovering anomaly.  By that time there were more puffy little clouds in a row leading to a stationary light rust colored blob at the same spot in the sky.  I took some more pictures of the unusual cloud effects and returned inside.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Once back in, I happened to glance outside to see the reddish blob again transforming into a brilliant light being more defined with a sort of shape with what looked to be a pair of blazing headlights. The skies all around were also again filled with crisp fresh jet contrails. Noticed too was that the light from the object was shining or reflecting as beams into surrounding clouds. The wispy rippled cloud around the object seemed to also expand and get rapidly bigger. A series of pictures was made within probably seven or eight minutes. Though I was tempted to put the camera on the 8-frames per second motor drive, it was decided to make more carefully composed individual pictures. Wanted the foreground images to help show perspective and location. In total, there are probably 20 or 25 pictures made with two professional grade, though older model, digital cameras. Of those, some look to be washed out before a lens hood was installed. The images on the original memory cards ha! ve not been modified so that the sequence of photos can be verified if needed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Below are four pictures made Thursday, March 6th, 2014 of the above described. These are in sequence with time between.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Photos:  ~ First view shows the rust red color blob with puffy clouds (vapor or exhaust?) trailing behind. Second picture is of a glowing object that developed within the wispy rippled skin cloud. The other two photos speak for themselves.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous.  PD))<n>

I was facing north on Vernonia, getting ready to turn left (west) onto Pittsburg.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I noticed the moon and glanced in its general direction and saw what appeared to be 3 lights emitting a faint glow moving from the SW to the NE.  The objects appeared to be at the same level as the lowest cloud layer, as initially I noticed the glow in the clouds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I recall that the clouds were moving fast the same direction the objects were traveling.  Since the cloud layer was broken the three objects eventually moved out of the clouds and appeared to be perfect translucent orbs.  The best description I can come up with is they looked like bubbles with a thick membrane.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At this point they were almost directly overhead and did not seem to glow as much.   I then proceeded to turn onto Pittsburg Rd and drive maybe 20 yards and stop and looked out my drives window when I noticed another one.  At this point I looked out! my passenger window (the direction they were traveling) and saw maybe 8 or 9 glowing orbs in the distance approaching the horizon.  They were not in a formation from what I could tell, they were in a loose group and heading in the same direction, the few that I had initially seen were trailing behind slightly...<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first I considered that they may be balloons, that were glowing from the moonlight.  However I doubt that the glow they would emit would be enough to cause a glowing aura around them in the clouds.  Also the 8 or 9 objects I saw towards the end of the sighting were a good distance off and were very visible (the glow was strong enough it looked like a solid light.)  I would also expect a balloon to tumble and possibly deviate slightly from its course with the others, none of these objects appeared to tumble nor did they deviate course at all.  The sighting maybe lasted a minute or so.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I felt I should share this report in case their are others reports.  There was another car heading east on Pittsburg and was going slow, I did not notice if the driver was looking up at they sky, she might have been turning onto Vernonia Rd.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous.

I noticed a group of three lights in a triangular formation.  The lights were too far apart to be a single craft--my guess would be they were about the length of three widebody airplanes apart.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The lights stayed in formation for a few minutes, then changed to a perfectly horizontal line.  They then returned to the triangular formation and stayed there for several more minutes before the left light disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The remaining two lights stayed in a linear formation for another 30 seconds or so before the right light also disappeared.  The center light still remained as I turned to leave the scene.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I did see some conventional aircraft heading toward the lights immediately after they disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I attempted to video the phenomenon, but street lights in the area were too bright to capture any worthwhile video.<n>

I then noticed that I could actually feel the rumbling in the ground that I was standing on.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I looked skyward and was confused at first because the sky looked so black - no stars at all.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I then realized that what I was looking at was a large unknown craft moving slowly in a southeast direction.  It continued on in that direction until I could no longer see it behind the trees in the distance.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I called our local police services to ask if anyone else had noticed anything strange and they reported that they were receiving multiple calls to report the same strange object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object was triangular in shape with small faintly lit lights evenly spaced around each edge with brighter lights at each corner of the triangle.<n>

Location near Monte Vista and Colorado in Turlock, CA.  She heard a very strange rumbling noise coming from the sky and it made the ground vibrate right up through her shoes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> She looked up and it was suppose to be partly cloudy night. No stars and no clouds.  Pitch black.  Then she notice tiny pin points of red lights and was scanning to one side and then saw a soft round ball of white light.  It was then that she saw an edge around this soft ball of white light.  She scanned for the edge till her head was turned the opposite direction and saw another soft round white light.  The continuing her effort to fallow the edge she found a third corner and realize this huge black triangle was over her blocking the sky and moving slowly over her.  Again it made a weird rumbling noise which vibrated up through the ground into her feet.  It was picking up speed as it traveled South east over all the other homes around her.  She froze afraid to move until it got passed her.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Next she bolted inside and got her parents who came out and it was too late it was gone, but they called the police to report it and were told that they knew already because calls were coming in.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Next day I called Turlock Police to see if there would be any info given on the news about the craft.  The man I talked to did not know anything about the incident, but checked his computer and said yes there were reports and police went to investigate and found nothing.  I asked how many reports and was told only two and I asked why and if that would keep it from being newsworthy and he said that more phone calls could have come in but they only log reports and those that are not repeat descriptions.  So he said that there may have easily been more then 2 calls.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I asked her if the object was bigger then a foot ball field and she replied oh yes. I asked bigger then three football fields and she said not sure but could be.  I asked her how high up she thought it was and she said it was massive and too hard to say how high up in the sky it was.  But it was so big that she had to pan her head all the way left and then all the way right to fallow one edge.<n>

Sunrise is a main road that runs east to west along the base of the Catalina Mountains and Swan (to the west of our apt) and Craycroft (to the east) are roads that run perpendicular north and south.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Tues night (3/4/14) at 7:39pm, my son was sitting on our third-floor, south-facing apt balcony.  From the balcony, which faces Sunrise, we have a panoramic view that includes city lights to the southwest, Davis-Montham/TIA lights to the south, and Tucson Mountains to west.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At around 7:39, my son noticed what appeared to be a large triangle-shaped &#34;craft&#34; with 3 point lights (spaced evenly apart in a straight line) along the back and a single light at what would be the point of the triangle or front of &#34;craft&#34;.  This large, expansive-looking &#34;craft&#34; was moving slowly and silently at an angle over Swan heading northwest in the direction of I-10.<n> <n><n> <n><n> He immediately called me as he was watching it and I happened to be driving north on Craycroft towards Sunrise with a friend following two cars back.  All the way up Craycroft to the light at Sunrise (about 1 mile), I was unable to see anything and thought he was exaggerating.<n> <n><n> <n><n> However, as I turned left to go west on Sunrise, there it was up ahead directly in front of me up in the sky.  My view of it was of the back three lights only as it moved away from my direction, heading west over Sunrise.  I did not see the front point light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A Pima County Sheriff&#39;s Supervisor SUV had been directly behind me at the Craycroft/Sunrise light and as soon he turned the corner behind me, he gave one blast of the siren, stomped on the gas, cutting around me and the car to the left, racing up Sunrise in that direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I reached home in about three minutes and it had already disappeared from my view.  My friend, who had been behind the Sheriif, had seen it as well as soon as we turned on Sunrise.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My son, however, said he watched all four lights seemingly disappear and ran to the other side of the building but it was not visible after that from any direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Nothing on the news or anywhere today about this.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We&#39;ve seen odd lights in the sky before from the balcony but never anything like this.<n>

The light hovered at times, but also appeared to travel, changing directions at random.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I got closer to the light, I rolled down my window so that I could get a better look at it.  I could make out no details other than the fact there was a blue light maneuvering above the road.  Eventually, I passed under it and as far as I could tell, the light was around 50 feet directly over the road.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Traffic was heavy in the area so I couldn&#39;t take my eyes off the road for too long.  It seems likely that other people saw it, too.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I think the most logical explanation for what I saw is a remote-controlled hobbyist&#39;s aircraft such as a helicopter or quad-copter.  Due to traffic noise, I couldn&#39;t make out the sound of a motor, but the perceived altitude and way that the light moved made me think of an R/C craft.  Still, I can&#39;t say for sure what I saw.<n>

They appeared to be very low in the sky.  I went inside and got my spot light and asked my wife to come outside and look.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I went back outside I walked towards my neighbors to get a better look.  I could tell they were advancing from the west to the east very slowly and more in line than side by side.  The first aircraft came over, slow for an airplane and I could hear it sounded like an airplane but not real loud, I was able to illuminate it enough with my spot light to tell it was triangular in shape, it had a white light in the front or tip of the triangle and more red and white lights down the sides didn’t count them or notice the order.  I watched as the next one approached it seemed to be following in the same flight pattern as the first, the third was the same as the other two.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I noticed two more lights in the distance approaching as the others did.

Then as soon as i said that , to my left a bright orange light lit up an scared the crap out of me.  It was probably a 100 meters away from me about 2oo meters up.  After the intinal shock i jst watch as it seem to come closer then back alittle bit an keep doing this for a while while glowing real bright then low then bright, like playing around.  As it started getting light it wasn&#39;t leaving?  I was thinking surely someone else could see this?  I even heard a helicopter an it went in oppersite direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Finally it started to leave around 6ish in which then i quickly ran inside to wake flatmate.

The sky was partly cloudy and there was no wind to speak of.  As my dog was feverishly sniffing around, I looked toward the southeast and saw a bright, red orb of light.  I estimate that it was about 1/8th of a full moon in size, although I admit that measuring with the naked eye is not my forte.  It was too low to be a satellite, and it neither made sound nor emitted any trail.  It was moving quite rapidly for about 15 seconds before stopping almost above me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I ran back home in a panic, not certain as to the craft&#39;s intentions.  Just before I could walk back in, I saw that it was growing fainter.  After about one minute of hovering and whirling erratically, the craft faded out of view.  I decided to continue walking, since my dog was utterly unfazed.  After about 3-5 minutes, I estimate that the time was 22:0.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was walking on a pier down the hill, when I took notice of another orb of much the same appearance as the first. This time, it was moving in a more northwesterly direction and was in view for about a minute or less.  Otherwise, it was too similar to the first encounter to recount without sounding redundant.  I am not even sure if this was a separate object, or the same one from before.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I habitually look up at the sky whilst walking outside.  However, I cannot name the stars and planets in the night sky right off my head.  It was very dark, so I could not make out any other shape except for the red light.  Its flight patterns did not seem consistent with weather balloons or Chinese lanterns in calm conditions.  I did not take any pictures unfortunately, as I don’t generally go looking for UFOs.  To my knowledge, there were no other aircraft nearby during the first encounter; at least, nothing that would be consistent with what I saw.  The two aircraft which I saw at the time of the second encounter seemed to pay no heed to the object.  I can assure you that I was perfectly sober that night, and I am above drugs.<n>

I’m not sure what I saw but considering the details which I will provide here, I am having a hard time coming up with a “good” explanation.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I live in a small town along the Washington coast just west of the city of Aberdeen. On March 1st I was driving to my friends home in the town of Long Beach, Washington, which is south of where I live.  I was driving south on Hwy 101, not too far south of the town of South Bend.  I had Willapa Bay out my right side window and a swampy area that drains into the bay on my left side.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I’m not sure of the time but I did back tracking and I think it was about 8pm.  I was at the location described and I noticed there were lights off to my left.  Either they were really small, or some distance away-I can’t be sure because it was dark.  I noticed I think 4 lights that from what I can tell were motionless, but I can’t be sure because my truck was moving-but they appeared that way anyway.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What caught my attention a lot was that they were directly at my 9:00 O&#39;Clock position-not up in the sky.  They changed colors constantly.  I remember seeing red, blue, orange and maybe green but I’m not sure about that last one.  When I realized they were not up in the air but either on top of, or just over the swampy area, I slowed my truck down considerably (just creeping along) because I wanted to see if anything was making a sound out there but all I could hear was a lot of frogs.  I got some video on my phone/camera (not really good video-quite short) and as soon as I stopped the truck they began moving very fast, they seemed to move to the north of me quite fast.  And one of them just blinked out.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have no idea what I saw and really don’t plan on telling too many people.  I made that mistake already and people think I’m a goon.  I learned my lesson with that.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The weather at that time was overcast (I couldn’t really see any stars or the moon), it was a wet weekend and there had been lots of rain coming and going but was not raining at that time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have lived in various places along the south Washington State coast all my 64 years.  I know all the towns and all the roads.  The traffic was light at the time this happened. I am not aware if there has been anything like this reported in this area; I know there’s plenty of stories of weird sea creatures washing up on the ocean beaches.  But that’s about it.<n>
