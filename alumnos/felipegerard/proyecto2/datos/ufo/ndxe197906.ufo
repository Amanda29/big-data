It looked larger than a football field and had no windows visible, just a medium green glow all over.  It made no sound, and was not a blimp.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were shocked to see it over a heavily populated area and watched it silently fly over the houses.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The next day it was all over the news, and there was an article in the San Jose Mercury News paper.   The radio news reports said that although it was near Moffet Field  Air Base, airbase personnel said it did not belong to them and they could not identify the object.  It was seen by many people.<n>

I was traveling north and saw something to the west.  At first I thought it might be a tree on fire but I could see the tree line and the orange fire ball was above it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was 11PM.  So next I could not write it off as the sun and have never seen the moon this bright and orange so  I determined it was a ball of fire.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was still visible when I got home which was about five minutes north of Elkhorn.  I awoke my husband and we looked out the window at it and another smaller ball of fire appeared.  After a few more minutes it just disappeared.  I don‘t remember the month or the year but it was in the late 70‘s.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We called Janesville police and they suggested that they had got other calls but would not comment.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The next day at work I was dying to tell somebody and when I did, a few others had seen it too.   A mother and her daughter claimed a flying object buzzed their car when they were traveling to Janesville on their way home.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then the next day, the mother and daughter brought in a paper article that there were multiple reports of  UFO sightings the night   I had seen the orange balls of fire.<n> <n><n> <n><n> If anyone has this article from the Janesville paper, I would love to see it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

6/30/79 22:00|Franklin Park area|IL|Unknown|2+ hours|Aurora Borealis-like lights near Franklin Park in late 1970's.|9/25/14|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/113/S113703.html|3|ndxe197906| Aurora Borealis-like lights near Franklin Park in late 1970&#39;s<n> <n><n> <n><n> This event in my distant past has been a source of puzzlement for close to 15 years now, and the timing is actually one of the most bizarre aspects of the encounter as I will explain.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The dates and times are mere supposition, as the memory is still very vague.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was attending NIU and driving back to school from my Mt Prospect home, at some point around 10:00 pm.  After passing the Curtiss Candy factory, off the 294 Hwy (heading South and looking off into the West), I noticed some strange lights that resembled the Aurora Borealis.  I recall stopping and discussing the lights with another woman who had also pulled over to the side of the highway (there were others, but I don&#39;t recall interacting with any one else).<n> <n><n> <n><n> The next memory I have that evening is being in the car miles away on the 5 Highway (now the 88) and driving back towards school, with approximately 2 1/2 hours unaccounted for.<n> <n><n> <n><n> However, the strangest aspect of this memory is that I didn&#39;t recall this incident AT ALL until over 20 years after it happened-and this is how the memory was sparked.  As a struggling writer in Hollywood, I use to make pitch meetings all the time, and from time to time I would see my ideas being produced.  I would laugh it off saying, &#34;Aliens are sucking my brain,&#34; and on one occasion, I said that same phrase that I had used literally dozens of times—and the memory (though cloudy and with the missing 2 1/2 hr gap) came streaming back and actually scared me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I know this is an extreme longshot, but Ive been hoping that someone might recall seeing those lights and help me at least put a day and time on the event itself.<n>

I say this because it moved so quickly that you could not keep sight of where it was going.  I was only 9 yrs. old but I remember every detail as though it was yesterday.  This is something you don’t forget.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After a minute we saw it again.  I’ve never seen anything make maneuvers like this did.  It moved horizontally and vertically.<n> <n><n> <n><n> While the object was still visible our headlights began to dim and the radio went completely static.  The size of it I’ll describe as best as I can.  If you hold out your thumb up in front of you it is the approximate size of the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The color was a light blue-green kind of glow.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Anyhow the object seemed as though it noticed us for a few seconds then it took of so quickly straight upward in the sky.  Then the static disappeared from the radio.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I know what I saw was not of anything man made.  I wet my pants.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date is approximate.  We have assigned an arbitrary date.  PD))<n>

We were returning to the Lake areas and heading east on US 30 outside Columbia City/Ft Wayne.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Off in the distance we could see a slow moving glowing object up fairly high heading east over the double highway. When it got closer it was lower and lower to the highway.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was five of us in the car and we were so shocked that I pulled over and we got out of the car to look. It was triagular shaped, lightly glowing underneath and you could see metal pockets and various pipes,etc.  We heard some noice, but not a jet sound or engines.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As it was almost completely over us and larger than both sides of the double highway, we were scared and we got back in the car and took off fast.  We all agreed that we knew we all saw a &#34;UFO&#34; that night and there was five of us who saw the same thing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> One passenger, however, saw the same thing coming across a corn feild near her home later that evening and was frightened that it was coming for her.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We will never forget it and when we see each other now 30 years later, we always mention it to each other where no one will here us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

6/16/79 23:30|Napa|CA|Triangle|10 minutes|Triangular UFO SIghting Napa County Summer 1979  (on the way to Lake Berryessa)|4/16/05|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/042/S42783.html|18|ndxe197906| Triangular UFO SIghting Napa County Summer 1979  (on the way to Lake Berryessa)<n> <n><n> <n><n> Having seen the ABC special ‘Seeing is Believing’ about UFO&#39;s recently, I recalled an incident that I had witnessed in Napa county back in 1979 along with a former girlfriend whom I’ve not spoken with since we parted in 1981.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This prompted me to perform an internet Google search (‘Triangular UFO Napa’) which led me to a website in which she had previously posted her recollection of the event in 2002 as per the link below:<n> <n><n> <n><n> http://www.scifi.com/ufo/encounters/laura_enc.html<n> <n><n> <n><n> My account differs slightly and given the years since, this is probably to be expected. I am writing to corroborate our story and acknowledge that this experience was a true incident. (If for some reason you need to corroborate this sighting with another’s from that area and year, you may contact me via telephone collect. In fact, if you have such information, I would like to read about it)<n> <n><n> <n><n> My personal recollection of the incident follows below:  As I recall it was a dark moonless night, but clear as the stars were visible. We had stopped briefly for some KFC takeout in St. Helena and were heading up 128 on our way to Lake Berryessa to meet some friends for a weekend boating trip.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At the crest of a small incline in the road which gave us a southwest view of the valley which was then about 20-30’ below us, Laura first noticed a bright light low on the horizon and pointed it out to me. (To my recollection, it was probably about 11:30pm when we made the initial sighting. When we arrived at the lake it was more like 1:30am as per her account).<n> <n><n> <n><n> My quick assessment was that the object (then perhaps 3/4+ mile away) was just a helicopter perhaps spraying the vineyards, but she remained skeptical. As we proceeded along the grade, it was evident watching the light that the craft was coming slowly in our direction moving perhaps at 10-20mph. Laura was not given easily to fear, and her apprehension made me nervous as I recall.  All that was visible was a very bright circular light which hid the details of the object except for perhaps a hint of a horizontal wing form. The surrounding vegetation in front/below of where the object was flying was illuminated by the intense white light emanating from the craft. The object appeared then to be about 15-20’ off the ground.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As we proceeded a bit further up the grade with the object creeping ever closer and higher, we came upon a bend in the road which had a turn out and was surrounded by a grove of eucalyptus(?) trees. I instructed her to pull over and stop the engine so we could hear the motor and determine what the object was. We watched the object come towards us for a few minutes more. It continued to ascend and it wasn’t long before it came directly overhead.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Now directly overhead, the bright light centered on the craft was now facing forward and above us per my recollection. With the light shining away, it was easy to distinguish the triangular shape of the craft against the black sky and stars. Using the height of the 25’ trees as a gauge and having watched the ascent of the object, it appeared then that it was approximately 50’ overhead and perhaps 35’ wide. I would guess it was perhaps 5’ tall in height, but because of the light in front, it was very hard to gauge the shape/size of the object until it was immediately overhead.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My recollection differs here in that I do not recall the object making any sound nor do I remember any colored lights underneath. It was dead quiet as it passed overhead moving at perhaps 15mph and proceeded to climb still higher until it disappeared over the hill behind us. I believe that I saw what appeared to be some sort of metal support system underneath, but it was so dark it is impossible to say with any certainty.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Now rather anxious about what we had just witnessed, we didn’t wait but a minute to start the engine and get out of there. As we were heading around a corner shortly afterwards, two sets of glowing eyes were seen in the bushes alongside of the road. I guessed it was just a pair of deer given the height, but neither of were willing to stop the car and find out what it was, although in hindsight I’m relatively certain it was in fact just a pair of deer or other wildlife as it was a wooded and secluded area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Now nearing our destination, we came upon a rest area which had a public telephone and stopped. With the hopes that someone could corroborate what we had witnessed, Laura got connected with the Air Force (likely Travis AFB). As I recall from her discussion, the AF indicated that they hadn&#39;t spotted any objects on radar nor were any test flights scheduled for the area that evening that might account for the mysterious object we had just seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We arrived at our final destination, thankfully, meeting our friends, but late, about 45 minutes by my recollection (which differs from her account of 1 ½ hours). We excitedly told our friends of our experience and they stared at us in utter disbelief and had a great time poking fun at us. Later as we were all sitting around outside gazing at the night sky and talking, we simultaneously witnessed 3 (?) bright objects which came shooting out of nowhere and stop in about a 10 o&#39;clock position on the northwestern horizon, very similar to what we had seen in Yosemite Valley the summer before together along with a different group of friends.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The objects hesitated for a brief moment hovering perhaps at 2000’, and then darted in and out like a game of cat and mouse and with one final push, shot upwards and were gone in the blink of an eye passing through the thin cirrus cloud layer above. That incident lasted but a few seconds in all, but it was enough to convince our friends that perhaps we had seen something after all.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I personally don&#39;t recall any jets going after the objects neither before nor after as Laura recounts, but it has been many years and I may have just forgotten. With Travis AFB fairly close by, it wouldn’t surprise me if there were jets in the area at the time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date is approximate.  PD))<n>

My father said no its moving too slow to be an airplane. So we stared as it slowly approached us.  As it got closer it looked like two stars connected then it disappeared,invisible.  It appeared to us within seconds a saucer right above the telephone pole on a residential street!  The bottom was spinning fast with bright blinking lights there was a huge window with a bright white light and two silhouettes with oval shaped heads one taller than the other the four of us staring at each other.  Then the window was gone and it began moving slowly up higher and higher then it moved in a zig zag the last move it sped off so fast faster than anything on earth and it was gone<n>

We were in the back bedroom of a single story duplex on Toulon Dr. in Baton Rouge. Out the back window of the room we saw a large metallic (silver-grey but not shiny) disk with round windows around the upper edge which were amber orange-yellow in color. It emerged from behind a cloud and moved slowly across the sky and into another cloud. During the time we watched and waited, it didn&#39;t emerge from the second cloud. The clouds were low puffy white clouds, otherwise the sky was blue, it was early dusk so it was light but not direct sunlight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I couldn&#39;t say how high it was in the sky, but it was low enough to see in great detail that it was a disk, that it did have windows (portholes) and that it was not in any way shaped like known aircraft. It was lower than we ever saw planes in that area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The craft moved much slower than you would expect a plane to fly. We heard no noise from inside the house.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Being kids and already in trouble, we told our family, but were sent back to bed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

(my memory of the date is terrible, but remembering the incident is extremely vivid) approximately 5 min. later, after the dog was put in, i saw the &#34;blue belly&#34; enter the sky to my left, it seemed as if it had slowed down for a minute. it moved around 8-10 miles (from Tracy to French Camp) at a speed of (estimate:10,000 mph) for almost 1-2 seconds, then took off(probably way over 15,000 mph)towards tahoe for a visable 1 second.then it seemed to cut into the sky and disapeared. it left a bluish vapor trail.(i must say, the haunting image i can never forget was:like seeing god; it was so beautiful, sacred,and graceful; and there&#39;s nothing like seeing advanced technology in action:it&#39;s awsome!<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date and time are approximate.

I was eight years old and my parents and I were visiting their friends, somewhere rural outside of Toronto.  Not exactly sure of where but it would have been in the GTA, summer, late in the afternoon. As the only kid there, I was told to go play outside. The backyard was a large grass area, with large trees( pines and such) and wooded areas around the perimeter of the property.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Anyway, I saw a movement in the sky and looked up. Gliding through the air was a ring shaped object. Not a disk, more like a substantial wedding band, with tall sides but a hollow narrow body. There was no noise, no smoke, no vapor. It was moving quite slow and low, maybe twice the height of the tree line.  The outer side of the &#34;band&#34; was black and had little white dot lights on it, similar to an electronic score board.  The ring itself did not appear to be spinning, but the white dots seemed to be scrolling around  and changing their configuration, but nothing that I could read.  The little dot symbols seemed very simple, just randomly changing and moving around.  There was no discernible front or back. It just quietly glided past with nothing changing other than the dots.  I watched it quite calmly for about 30 seconds and then it went past the treeline and I couldn&#39;t see it anymore.I then went in to get everyone to come out to the front yard to see if we could still see it.  The adults weren&#39;t that interested in my rambling about a spaceship and when I went back outside, of course it had not reappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Being 8 at the time, I don&#39;t seem to have a good grasp of the size. I seem to recall it being small, maybe 15 to 15 feet across. I remember thinking that it had to have very small spacemen or that it was being controlled remotely, being that the shape didn&#39;t seem like anyone could be inside. But who knows, maybe it was bigger than I remember or maybe they were really really small, lol.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Over the years I have wondered if it was some sort of remote controlled aircraft or weird balloon, etc. but it just doesn&#39;t seem plausible. It was definitely flying, with no noise, no vapor, no strings and looked like a simple band horizontally gliding above the trees. I thought I would put it out there to see if anyone has ever seen anything similar<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))<n>

It was like a shooting star but only 30 ft. above the ground at the highest.  I know this because as it passed over I-80 the object was lower than the overpass ahead evenly following the contour of the hilly terrain,<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was then that a hugh sonic boom occured and rocked my car off the left side wheels, it was such a bang that it felt like something had violently pushed my car, this got my girlfriends attention. Certianly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At this moment both my, and her left ears popped.  Yes just our left ears, remember the object passed from right to left.  As fast as it had appeared, it was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Pretty incredible wouldn&#39;t you say.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

I was about 7 or 8 at the time my parents and i were traveling home one night and when we were close to home my father noticed some lights in a field ahead of us. as we got closer we could see a very large craft hovering above a field. We stopped and my dad says i am getting out to get closer and i said im going with you dad. we walked toward the object and got within 50 feet of it it was huge. I would say it measured about 300 feet in length and height wise was about80 to 100 feet. It was saucer shaped with windows going all around the middle.  I remember looking up through the windows and the inside was just the purest white i have ever seen as far as lighting goes. the outside was pure silver and underneath was a light that glowed. then i noticed figures coming up to the windows.  I started to get frightened and walked back to the car and stood by the passenger side by my mom and it appeared as though she was frozen i tried talking to her but she said nothing. i said come on dad lets go and he never answered me just stood in one place staring. then it took off made no sound but i heard like a rush of air as it moved at an unbelievable amount of speed and disappeared.  Then we got back in the truck and drove to our house on elk lake. After getting home we went into our basement and looked out over the lake and witnessed the craft hovering in the same spot , it had red and green lights emulating from the bottom. I remember looking at the clock and seeing that it was 12:00 midnight excactly.  My dad said he was going back and i said i was tired and going to bed.  We never talked about it the next day and went about our business as though nothing ever happened. Within the last 8 years it has been increasingly been on my mind and now being 32 i am curious as to what happened that night. I asked my mom about it and she says that i was in the car the whole time.  Thinking about the time i dont think it was that late, i mean my parents usually had me home in bed by 9 or 10 at the latest all the time .  I have since have repeated nightmares of being taken and am not sure what is going on.  I haven&#39;t really told anyone about this other than a very few close friends and fiance.  I cant say for sure that i am a recipient of an abduction but i know what we saw that day and i believe we had some serious missing time.  I would like to go under hypnosis but am scared of what i may recover from that day.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We have written the witness, requesting that his parents submit reports of their recollections, as well.

It started at this grave yard I have never been too or seen before. I found myself sneaking through the grave yard not knowing why but just kept going. Then I seen a few other people doing the same as me just going forwared not knowing why. Then I noticed we were all heading towareds a pond, up by the waters edge is where we all went. It was weird I remember we were not speaking to each other, but I was not scared. Then all the sudden a man in white was standing above the water and started talking to us, he said he brought us all here to tell us we were using nuke power the wrong way. He said we would change that some day, and we all got a book. then he called me up there with him I stood beside him and then this bright lite came up out of the water beside him. It was like a big triangle. Then it was over.<n>

Drove me home off Bolsa Road.    It was Cold and very dark out that evening as it was Winter Season.  Our road we lived on was not a (through road).  It was out in the Country which surrounded Agriculture Fields and Hills.  When we got to our Mail box off the side of the road (which allows you to turn onto our small path leading to our home my brother (stopped the car near the mail box).  We both got silent as we both were looking at the same thing at about the same time.  He finally said; do you see what I see?  I could not look at him, I was scared and could not believe what I was seeing myself.  It was (two Egg Shaped round objects) spinning as fast as they could (side to side within space between them).  They where in the (Deepest Bright Orange Colors) I had ever seen.  We just sat there staring at them too frightened.  (They appeared out of no where)  My brother finally said; come on lets go home.  When we got near our home my brother asked if we should call and report it to the Police our tell our mother what we saw.  I said NO, lets just tell mom.  I never forgot that experience.  To this day my brother don&#39;t care to talk about it as he is a Engineer. I don&#39;t think to this day he really wants to believe or accept what he saw.  So, we don&#39;t talk about it.

We saw something that looked like a boxkite it had lights on the top and bottom corners of it giving it a rectangle shape, short ends at top and bottom.  We decided to follow and get better idea what it was,got to the end of the street and it went to the East toward the canyon and before we could turn left it was in the west over the hospital, tallest building in the city at the time.  We were in awe! that was almost 2 miles in a flash.  We knew we could not keep up with it and chose to go home. I remember nothing after that not even getting home, I still can&#39;t remember getting home, or anything for that matter! This thing moved in a way I&#39;ve never seen before or since, it could just stop and hover, silently too, it could change direction immediately.  Wish I could remember it dissapearing or us leaving to go home, I was sitting in a car at the corner of a main intersection of town watching this thing then it was next day and I woke up at home in bed?!<n>

We were coming back from a friends house later at night, it was a clear night and dark with no cloud cover. We stopped to get the mail from our box, and my mom said to look out the window. In the sky was a large and very bright circular object, yellow in color with a streaking appearance to it, as if you threw something wet and the water would come off it as it flies. The streaks were yellow and would disappear. Here is the interesting portion of the event. Behind the craft/UFO was a Naval jet from NAS Whidbey, probably an A-6 Intruder, which were stationed there, chasing it. The craft flew behind the trees and we lost view of it. The A-6, about half a mile behind it, followed, and we lost sight of it. We went into the house and never heard anything about it. I have since served in the military, and have never seen anything of the like of this occurrence. I was young, but this is still very clear in my mind. I never reported it until now as I never knew of a place to report such info.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD))<n>

I was driving to pick up my step daughter from a girl scout meeting at the Farmington town hall. I was traveling along back country roads to the town hall some 10 miles away. I was on Collette Rd when I noticed the car in front of me pull to the side, get out and stare across the road. I looked to the left and saw a very large silhouette shape directly above a small lumber yard.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I stopped about 100 feet behind the other car and got out as well. It was dark and the craft had no lights on it but with ambient light the silhouette was clearly visible. It was about 50 ft above the lumber yard building. Id guess it was at least 100 yards long and 30 yards high. It clearly was larger then the building and was about 250 ft. from where we stood. I watched it for about 4 to 5 minutes and it slowly started drifting silently at an angle away from us. There were a lot of stars that night and its shape clearly covered stars as it moved. We both got in our cars and drove off. The lead car went straight and I was turning left just about  300 ft ahead. I kept the thing in sight as I drove until I made the turn when I lost sight of it in the dark.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I drove the 7 miles or so to get my step daughter and her friend who were the last kids at the town hall waiting at the front door to be picked up. They both ran up , got in the car excited and told me about the same craft  I had seen , that had passed directly above them.  I then realized it was drifting off in that general direction across farm lands while I ran parallel east bound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We compared stories as I had seen it from the side and she saw it from below. She described it as two large separate fuselages connected by  a wing type assembly. It made no sound  at all and had no lights. I always wondered if anyone else in the area had seen this that night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.  PD))<n>

I mean ninety degree angles without slowing down or speeding up. My mother also saw it. I am convinced if such technology existed as it seems beyond what we have seen so far, including stealth. We would be utilizing it by now. It covered hundreds of miles in split seconds. I am 36 now and nothing so far comes close. I know what I saw, just don&#39;t know what it was.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I have written several times . Many of my reports do not have accurate dates. I have had several things happen.  Anyway.. I have a question that I am hoping someone will have an answer to.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I was in 6th grade , approx 11 years old, my family and I witnessed an exstreamly large craft go from the west to the east side of town and directly over our home. It started out looking like a brilliant , bright  white light traveling very slowly from the west phoenix area. We were alerted to it by my brother who was on his way home with his father who lived in Scottsdale. He noticed it while on the freeway and was very concerned to see it still in the sky when he arrived to our home which was at Gaudalupe and Dobson rd. My whole family- Mother ,grandparents , step father and one of my brothers friends- all went outside to see what he was so upset about. We observed this  object coming closer to us . It was , no joke, about the size of a football field. It didn&#39;t have lights on it like it looked from far away. As it got closer we could see it was illuminating from within. It made no noise, just a low kind of warm humming sound. Not like a blimp. It was flying  low and it was  exstreamly large. I would say if you were to hold your hand out you would have to put two fingers together to cover it. My step father worked at air research at the time and even he was puzzled as to what it was. It was not a blimp, plan, or helicopter. It looked like it had windows completely around it, or possibly metal  panels and if I remember right it almost (im not trying to make a joke) but it kinda looked like the starship enterprise. Only in the sense that It seemed to have two sections to it. It was moving super slow .When it reached the end of our block it swayed a bit and you could see it was wider that our street. It then sped up and took of ,very fast north east and was gone. Absolutely gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The next day I said something to my teacher.. He got very excited and made me go to the principles office and draw a picture for the principle. They both questioned me.. My teacher had seen it also and was using me to try to help prove his story.. It was very outrageous and I am sure very unbelievable if you hadent seen this for yourself.. I am getting to my question.. please be patient.  ..<n> <n><n> <n><n> Now when I was sixteen, living in the same home, I had a very unexplainable event. I was coming home from my best friend house .. She lived 2 miles from me. I left at exactly 8:50PM .. I know because we use to watch the Waltanns religiously- of all shows!! anyway,  the show ended at 9pm. I was also due in at 9 , if I was late I would be grounded.. At sixteen that is the worst thing in the world to have happen.. My parents were strict and I was never late. So I pulled in front of the house , shut off my VW bug and then I was surrounded by the most intense blue-white light. My car kinda rumbled .. Its very hard to explain. I at the time thought I had been hit by lightning,I could feel the energy. Thats what I attributed it to at that second,  without realizing it was a totally clear night. The color of the light was  not a color I can explain.  It was blueish white. It consumed me and the whole car. Then it was over and I jumped out of the car and ran in. I was greeted with two VERY upset parents. I was an hour late. I had completely forgot what had just happened.. Even when trying to defend myself. I had no excuse and was very confused.. All I know is I left at 8:50 and walked in at 10pm.  I called my friend sobbing, screaming at her for making me late.. She defended the fact of when I left and said I was crazy. I was traumatized because I was not allowed to see my boyfriend for a week, or talk on the phone.. I didnt recall the light thing for about 3 to four years later. To this day my friend remembers the event.. We are still very good friends.. We still cant explain why i was late or what happened.. I am writing wondering if anyone has had a similar event.. If anyone has seen something then while at the same location they have a loss of time or some other unusual event.. Is it possible that the first time we saw the craft it was the first of several visits? I am not making much sense.. I guess I am wondering -if it is possible that abductions occur, do you think they make a planned route that they trav! el?.. Do they scope out , or survey areas and people  first?  I am confused and still want to understand what happened.. I have had 2 other events in my life where I have had the same light consume me. It is an unforgettable color I have never seen duplicated, even in the movies.  Only one of the other  times  I have  a witness to my time loss. Again, at the time you forget what has just happened, and are left just completely confused. .  All the times I remember seeing the light , but never seem to be able to comprehend it or associate with what is or has happened.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am not a very good writer, I hope this makes sense to someone.. I really hope I can get some kind of understanding of this.. Is there any other people in Az that something like this has happened to them? One thing I did not mention.. The friend of my  brothers who witnessed the ship with my family the first time, he still to this day will not talk about it.. He will admit he saw it, but CAN  not elaborate. I tried to talk with him about 6 years ago and he gets all sweaty and freaked out.. He actually almost crys.. He cant talk about it for some reason.. Im wondering if  possibly something happened to him and he remembers it too much.. Or is it possible he had bad things done to him, or ma bey his mind cant comprehend something that happened to him that night? I am hoping someone can give me some kind of answer or insight... ..<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.  PD))<n>

6/1/79 20:00|Margate|FL|Oval|3-5 minutes|Night, black, silent, round, oval, pulsating lights on edge, very close proximity|8/5/09|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/070/S70671.html|60|ndxe197906| night, black, silent, round, oval, pulsating lights on edge, very close proximity<n> <n><n> <n><n> All my life I thought it was just a dream that was stored in a way real events are. Like recalling it as if it were a real event. Anyway, I didn&#39;t really  give it much thought until a couple years ago. I was at a party with my brother and he brought it up. I don&#39;t ever recall discussing it with him other then during the encounter.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When he brought it up I was shocked. I really did think it was just an extremely realistic dream that i had as a kid.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We both shared many feelings about it. The shared feelings are more strange than the encounter in my opinion. We both remember not being freaked out, it was if it was no big deal. After the incident and mostly during it, we did to seem to care all that much. In recollection, that is stranger to us more then the encounter.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The encounter- We were out flying my black kite at about 8PM. We still don&#39;t know why we decided that was a good idea but kids do dumb things. As we were flying it (always looking upwards) my string felt strange. I knew it was up and that it was flying. I just didn&#39;t feel the kite on the end. It was very strange. We suddenly noticed a large object with multicolored pulsating or flashing lights off to the side where we thought the kite should have been. My guess it was more of a pulsing but its been a long time ago. We should have seen it coming in from further away but we didn&#39;t. One moment we were flying a kite, the nest we see an object about 300yards away heading right for us. It was about 50 -100 feet off the ground. It was fairly large.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first I thought it was the blimp and it just turned on its lights and thats why we didn&#39;t see it coming at first. It was moving about 25mph, maybe a little less. As it got closer we looked back at it because we then realized it wasn&#39;t the blimp, or even a silent helicopter (as a kid I thought those existed). It was making absolutely no sound at all.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Lights still pulsing around it on the sides. As it got closer it was apparent that it was flattish and sort of rounded or oval. Its surface was extremely black. We strained to see &#34;its&#34; surface but we really couldn&#39;t. It was solid and not transparent. the lights on the edges sort of curved down the sides to almost the bottom edge.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was now maybe 75yds away and my kite crashed. This is the weird part. Most people would be freaking out at this. What did we do? We were worried about my kite. I reeled it in as fast as I could but it wasn&#39;t  fast enough. We both looked back at the object and at this point it was going to pass overhead. It was definitely lower now. Maybe 50&#39; feet.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It passed directly overhead just to our right. it was perhaps 60-80 feet wide. Still making no sound at all.<n> <n><n> <n><n> All we remember after that was making mention then we needed to get my kite back. So we walked to the crashed kite. It was like we didn&#39;t care about the huge craft above us. We walked over to my kite totally ignoring it. We examined the kite and noticed one of the sticker eyes was missing. It probably blew off but we joked that &#34;they&#34; took it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then we decided to look again at the craft and it was a hundred yards or so away moving away quietly. We watched it for a few seconds at most because for an odd reason it didn&#39;t matter. We didn&#39;t care.<n> <n><n> <n><n> That was the last we saw of it. We never saw it continue its journey away. It was just over. it may have continued or blinked out. I will never now. It left the way it appeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This may not entertain some UFO or Alien enthusiasts but we both agreed that we must have created the story in our youth and it became a false memory. Its strange that we both share the  same exact memory, but I am sure its possible.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I decided to send this in as a UFO report because it seems like a UFO encounter. Maybe it really was. I will never know. I wanted to make it public in case anyone else experienced this.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))<n>

It seemed as if the object was five to ten miles away and it was larger than a plane would be and oblong.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I immediately leaned forward and watched in confusion and amazement as the object flew across the sky from south to north finally disappearing behind clouds, lighting up the clouds from behind before it disappeared.  The whole sighting only lasted ten or twenty seconds but it was quite remarkable.  The next day I was happy to see that the local paper.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The Ithaca Journal, had a small article reporting that many others had reported seeing this.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

No noise, seemed about 40 to 50 feet in diameter.  We watched it go forward over the farmers field an don&#39;t know if it speeded up so fast to disappear, but as it left the horizon it looked like it actually landed.  I told my friend to go check out the field the next day cause it looked like it landed behind a row of tress we could see against the horizon.  We were scared to tell anyone at the time, but just about three weeks later, there was a major sighting in Haslett, Michigan and a UFO hovered right over my aunt and uncles house, they said it light up everything around and the light in their windows woke them up.It was only then I felt I could tell my parents about it.  I was 14 or 15 years old at the time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))<n>

It was I believe early in 1979 when their was much publicity concerning the NASA &#34;Sky Lab&#34;. Much information was being given out via the media concerning the sky lab and it decaying orbit. It was being reported to the public by several radio and TV stations that sometime with a few days skylab would eventually fall to earth. I recall overhearing this on a late news segment. The broadcast also indicated that it would possible to observe the sky lab as it passed overhead. They news gave a general direction in which to look and a general time also. My now ex-wife and a friend went outside to attempt to watch for the ill fated sky lab. It was a very clear and calm night. There was no wind or other noises to speak of. We were watching the sky for about 20 seconds when from the northwest moved right overhead was a giagantic object. So large it covered the entire sky above us. The object was very dark possible either black (or it seemed to not reflect light). or opague. It had some very small dim white light placed in random order around its hull. It was completely silent. We heard no engine noise or any other noise for that matter. The object rotated approx 90% as it &#34;hovered&#34; slowly. it then moved off over the hoizon. As the object moved off we then observed the &#34;sky lab&#34; pass overhead. Which resembled a regular satalite as it passed<n>

My sister who at the time was 11, pointed towards the sky and said look at that, as I looked out her passenger side window I noticed a black circular disc, with changing lights, confused at what I was looking at, I asked my parents pointing to the sky,&#34; what kind of plane is that&#34;, my mother looked out her window and yelled at my father to stop the car. My father not having a clue as to what we were looking at slammed on the brakes. Looked out the window and asked my mother, &#34;is that a flying saucer?&#34; I remember the expression on my parents faces, they looked as if they had seen a ghost, more fear than confussion. They didn&#39;t get out of the car, let alone, allow us to get out, but we just stayed there looking at this thing in the sky, but it stayed still in that same spot, probably about half a block in front of us and 12 stories high, and it spinned at a very low pace, but it did have changing colored bright lights. Then it began to travel towards the park we were heading too so, i&#39;m assuming curiousity from my parents, we followed it, and sure enough it hung around right above the park, at the same distance from us as we saw it earlier on the road. On the street it probably stayed up there for a good 15 minutes and then at the park for a good 20 to 30 minutes. Other people at the park were seeing this with us, and then it just slowly bega to go higher and higher until it vanished from sight, at this point it was getting darker, so the lights were visibly brighter. Then we left, talked about through the years, but recently I brought it, and for some strange reason, my parents nor my sister seem to remember this event, which makes no sense to me, because we talked about this happening through the years.But now no one seems to remember. And I know i&#39;m not crazy, and I would not invent this in my head. I just wanted to report this because I wa! nted to see if anyone else had a similar experience like this. Thank you ............I am also submitting a sample drwaing of what I saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

THEY HAD A SMALL HOUSE IN THE BACK OF THE MAIN HOUSE, AND I HAD LEFT MY CIGARRET LIGHTER THERE.  AS WE LEFT THE SMALL HOUSE TO ENTER THE MAIN HOUSE I REMEMBERED I LEFT MY LIGHTER.  MY FRIENDS WENT ON INTO THE MAIN HOUSE AND I WENT BACK INTO THE SMALL REAR HOUSE TO GET MY LIGHTER.  AS I LEFT THE SMALL HOUSE ENTERING THE MAIN HOUSE I LOOKED UP INTO THE SKY AND THERE WAS WHAT APPEARED TO BE A PLANE BUT, IT HOVERED RIGHT OVER HEAD....I STOOD WATCHING IT.  I WOULD SWEAR I HEARD VOICES COMING FROM IT, AND I WOULD SWEAR I STOOD OUT THERE A GOOD 20MINUTES OR MORE.  I COULD ALMOST SAY I UNDERSTOOD WHAT THE VOICES  WERE SAYING BUT,I COULD NOT REPEAT IT.  AFTER A WHILE THE UFO SPEED OFF AT A FAST RATE OF SPEED OUT OF SIGHT.  WHEN I GOT IN THE HOUSE WITH MY FRIENDS THEY ASKED WHY IT TOOK ME SO LONG, AND I TOLD THEM OF WHAT I HAD SEEN.  THEY LAUGHED AT ME OF CORSE BUT, &#34;I-KNOW-WHAT-I-SAW!&#34;.  WHEN I GOT HOME I TOLD MY FAMILY, AND THEY TOO THOUGHT I WAS LOOSING IT.  UNTIL NOW I HAVE NEVER HEARD OF ANYONE SEEING A CROSS-SHAPED UFO THEN I READ YOUR SIGHTINGS OF CROSS SHAPED UFO&#39;S.  IT BROUGHT TEARS TO MY EYES.  AS OF RESENT I HAVE NOTICED PLANES WITH THE LIGHTS AT THE BOTTOM THAT STRETCHED FROM ONE END OF ALL FOUR LINES (+) TO THE CENTER BUT, THEY &#34;WERE&#34; PLANES.  I LOOK FORWARD TO ANOTHER UFO ENCOUNTER, AND SOON.  THERE ARE OCCUPIED UFO&#39;S OUT THERE AND THEY ARE NOT ALL HARMFUL TO MAN.  LIKE HUMANS, THE ALLIENS COME IN A VARIETY OF PERSONALITIES, AND IN THE NEAR FUTURE WE WILL KNOW WHAT THEIR PURPOSE IS, AND WHY THEY CHOSE CERTAIN HUMANS TO SEE THEM OR THEIR CRAFTS. IN 1994, THEIR WERE TWO ALLIENS IN OUR APARTMENT. THE SHORT ONE ON THE INSIDE OF OUR DOOR AND THE TALLER ONE ON THE OUTSIDE OF OUR APARTMENT DOOR.  WHEN I SAW THEM I FAINTED, AND MY TWO SONS WOKE ME.  WHEN I TOLD THEM WHAT I HAD SEEN, THEY LAUGHED.  BUT, AGAIN &#34;I-SAW-WHAT-I-SAW!&#34;. THIS IS THE FIRST TIME I HAVE EVER WRITTEN TO ANYONE WHAT I HAVE EXPERIENCED BECAUSE, I REALLY FEEL THE GOVERNMENT KEEP RECORDS, AND LOCATIONS OF THOSE WHO HAVE EXPERIENCED UFO OR ALLIEN ENCOUNTERS.  BUT, AFTER READING THE SITINGS OF &#34;CROSS&#34; SHAPED UFO&#39;S I FEEL COMFORTABLE IN SHARING WITH OTHERS MY EXPERIENCE. I ALSO THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE SO WE CAN SHARE WITH ONE ANOTHER OUR UFO EXPERIENCES. PEACE BE WITH YOU ALL, AND YOURS.<n>

I called my sister, who was lying at the back of our garden sunbathing and asked if she had seen falling something. She saw the wire but didn&#39;t know where it suddenly came from. I followed the wire expecting a kite hanging in the tree, but it was on oval-shaped bright orange thing that was attached to it. I climbed into the tree until it was right before me.

It was toward the of the end of summer as the days were beginning to get shorter. I remember playing in the front yard. I lived in the Oaks. Its mostly mid-class families. The sky was gray and somewhat cool as it gets in Texas towards the evening time. I was on the corner of where our yard where we lived at Briar Oaks and well the cross street was Carter Creek, well it turns into Carter Creek at the Curb by the Royal Oaks Racket Club use to be.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I saw a Bright light hovering above our yard. It as I could tell somewhat oval shaped as the light resemble a floucent light color but much brighter. I describe it as oval shape as that was how the light extended.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I watched it for- it felt like a long time probably between 10 to 15 min. It didn&#39;t appear to be very high maybe 1 to 2 football fields high. I wanted to get a ladder and get a closer look. After several minutes of watching it, I remember my neck hurting from staring into the sky for so long. There was no sound and the craft was just hovering with No moment.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I remember running inside a telling my mom. I ask if we had some binoculars to get a closer look.<n> <n><n> <n><n> She said &amp;quot;No&amp;quot; we didn&#39;t. I told her she had to come outside to see it. Once back outside it was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Later that night I remember telling my mom that we had to watch KBTX Channel 3 to see if anyone else saw it. The weather man did say something. I thought that was awesome. He stated that several other people called in that night about a bright light in the sky. He laughed, joking and said we all hope it was just a weather balloon with no real explanation.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I hope someone in that neighorhood who saw what I did will also post there experience that day. I am very surpised with the number of calls the news recieved no one else has placed anything on this website.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am currently 34 years old and been serving in the US Army for over 15 years.

6/1/79 00:00|Minot|ND|Rectangle|3-4 mins|Large rectangular object hovering over Minot Air Base, ND.|12/9/03|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/033/S33514.html|70|ndxe197906| Large rectangular object hovering over Minot Air Base, ND.  I was age 5 or 6 so the details are a little fuzzy.  Woke up around midnight to use the bathroom and upon my return saw a huge rectangular object floating in the sky through the bedroom window.  Object was roughly the size of an aircraft carrier.  Mostly rectangular in shape although with other angular features.  Lights were scattered about the surface of the craft although I don&#39;t remember any specific colors.  Here&#39;s the kicker - after viewing the object for a minute a pair of doors opened on the craft.  Doors retracted into the top and bottom of a rectangular space in the craft.  The doors were much more wide than tall.  A second craft emerged from the rectangular space, moved away from the first craft, angled slightly and moved out of sight.  I only remember the second craft was disc shaped, I don&#39;t remember the color or if it had lights.  The doors from the first craft closed and it remained hovering in place.  No sounds were emitted from either craft.  After watching this unfold over 3-4 minutes I went back to sleep thinking this is too unbelieveable to be real.  However I did pinch and shake myself to make sure I was really awake.  Told parents about my sighting the next day and a base policeman stopped by to file a report.  The policeman dismissed my sighting as a kid having a dream.  It was all too real for me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>
