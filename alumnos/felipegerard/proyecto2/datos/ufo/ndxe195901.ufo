I looked out the window from that room and noticed sometype of lights; being dark and they normally not there, I opened front door and went outside.  We lived on a very dark street, with minimal light during dark hours. I saw a disk/saucer UFO, ran in to get my Mother, pulled her outside and pointed, there was the UFO at same point, hovering approxmiately 20 ft above the electrical pole; within 10-15 seconds, boom, it took off.  My Mother couldn&#39;t belive her eyes.  We left our home our 7:10pm that evening, taking back streets, which have minimal light, to get to where we were going.  Suddenly here came the saucer streaking in the sky above us; we viewed it again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The saucer in its stationary position when we first viewed it, was silver in color, with one row of lights above and two rows of lights below.  Picture a dinner plate with one bowl lying downside on the top of the plate, and one bowl lying upside on the bottom of the plate. Between the plate and each bowl were the rows of lights. The upper lights were red, and the lower two rows were green and yellow.  The lights were individual sections that would pulsate and go on individually.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This was really quite and experience.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>
