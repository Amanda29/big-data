The object had the shape of a comet or large meteorite, with a “head” about 1/2 lunar diameter and a “tail” about 3 lunar diameters in size. It passed at a high rate of speed from right to left, in a generally North or Northeast direction, also moving downward at about a 30 degree angle relative to the horizon.  It was visible to me for less than a second. What made it highly unusual to me was its color.  It appeared to be a consistant shade of green, perhaps yellow green, bright, almost of a flourescent quality.  The surface of both the object and its tail appeared mottled, broken up by dark patches between the green.  It had the appearance of something colored by a flourescent pen on an animation gel, with no variation in color aside from the mottled appearance.  The mottling and the detail of the object’s tail appeared to be changing slightly as it quickly passed, convincing me it was no reflection. It did appear to be travelling beneath the cloud cover, indicating a fairly low altitude.  Under that cloud cover, I had clear visibility well beyond the range of the object, which I would guess to be 1/2 to 1 mile away. This is only the second time I have seen anything like this...my only other sighting was well over 30 years ago, consisting of a group of star-like objects moving in formation, seen by three other witnesses at that time. I have no idea even how to categorize what I saw...Is this one of the “fireball” objects I have heard about? Would be very interested to get feedback on this, even if it is commonplace among your reports. Thank you for your service...it is appreciated. Notes:  I would be willing to accept a collect call if you feel it is worth the time. Best time to call would be between 8 AM and 1 PM EST.  That would be 5-10 AM PST. Alternatively, I will also answer any email.<n>

I observed a consistent, bright green light with no tail appear falling from 35 degrees high from observation point.  The green light reached the top of a visible thunderhead and it fragmented with no terminal flash into two bright orange-yellow lights that had a similarity to flares.  Next one of the two lights separated into a total of four bright orange-yellow lights.  The objects became brightly illuminated for a few seconds and faded-out in a stationary position above the cloud top.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  The date of the sighting may be approximate, although the witness does not indicate that fact.

Varied speed at some points appeared to stop forward movement and hover.  Two of the lights stayed mostly in the same spot in the formation.  3rd light moved faster and slower, up and down, changing the formation several times but always remaining in a triangle.  Changed direction and faded away.  At one point one of the lights appeared to drop another light from it.  Initially moved northwest then turned more northly before fading away.  Were very close at the beginning, but never heard any engine noise.<n>
5/29/00 21:00|Clovis|CA|Light|15 minutes|Please respect my privacy.  The object was bright and changed directions|7/11/00|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/013/S13342.html|5|ndxe200005| Please respect my privacy.  The object was bright and changed directions<n> <n><n> <n><n> On Sunday May 29th or 30th.  My mother, my brother, my newphews and nieces and me all watched a light in the sky.  I first assumed autmatically that it was a plane, but right away I knew it wasn&#39;t.  It moved slowly across the sky.  Then it changed directions and moved back.  It went north and then east.  It seemed to be harassing the planes that passed by.  Then it looked like it was looking for someone.  I then went in and grabbed my camcorder.  I filmed all over the sky.  But didn&#39;t see anything on camera.  Later when I put the tape in the VCR the object showed on film.  I was suprised that I had filmed it.  The object goes slow across the sky.  It changes direction in the film.  It also changes shape.  I do not want any publicity or our privacy violated.  This is why I took so long in reporting this.  This is the first time that I got a good look at something like this. It resembled the light a plane gives when flying. But once you see the film you know it is not a plane.  It seems to have an intelligence.  Like it knew what it was doing.  If you would like to make a copy please write me. I will not surrender original copy because it has family members and pets in it.  The part of the tape with the object is not that long any way.  Please contact me by mail.  At first it was exciting to watch it in the sky. But after a while it got boring.  When writing or calling ask for ((name deleted)).  Please write.  Will not accept collect calls.  I did not mark check by being contacted by investigator.  Again it is due to privacy reasons.  I am willing to share tape with you, but someone else has to record off original copy. I don&#39;t know how to make a copy.  Thank you for your time.<n>

I have seen meteorites falling and burning, and I know satelites because I was in the military, and there is Eros Data Center here. Satelites can be seen regularly over our town. On the date of this report, I was out for the specified reason. Cool, stary night, no wind and no clouds. My atention got caught by a flash which came from the sky. It hapend on the SE side of town. Since I was facing that direction I imediately raised my head and I saw a flash trail, white at the point of impact and going through yellow to read and purple blueish at the end. The object fell from the sky coming from NE toward SSW and no sounds were heard. Back in in Europe where I am from in the mid 70&#39;s I&#39;ve seen two Very weird shaped flying objects over Braila, far east Romania, coming like from Russia going west over a big industrial complex. They looked like space capsules, no insignias or writings on, and no sounds. I remeber that even tough just a kid then. Here in SF, I&#39;ve seen lights flashing in the sky, but this month I&#39;ve seen three lights dimer then the big dipper, considerably dimmer like the far away stars. Those lights were flying high and in app 1 minute disapeared in the sky. They were flying in a iregular shaped triangle, in sync and constant speed. And I mean they went up in the space, they just vanished going up. I am constient that they are only two explanations for such sights. Our gov secret projects or satan is cooking up something which I don&#39;t think is good for us. With respect ((name deleted))<n>

I saw a strobing light (It strobed only twice) then it went out. Then a very bright light came on then faded out, there was a distance between the strobing light and the bright light. No other lights were present. Then it was gone. (No blue or red lights like on a airplane).  I went inside my house and told my wife and our friend, I saw something really strange, and they followed me outside immediately, we were looking to the west.  I was telling them what I had just saw. Then I said look at that, and pointed my finger up and we saw a V shaped craft (7 lights in a V shape) it headed west to east. It seemed to be just one object.  All the lights were the same brightness and size. We watched the object for about 7 to 10 seconds as it traveled to the east very quickly and silently and then if just disappeared. There was no sound at all.  My wife and our friend stayed outside looking for the object as I went inside and looked at the time (It was 10:32 pm) and I called Peter Davenport immediately.  We all stayed outside for some time after the sighting and observed several aircraft in the area. This object was definitely not an airplane or like anything any of us had ever seen before. (Our house is located about 2 miles east of McCellan Airforce Base.) The witness&#39; were myself (Age 37 - Communications Technician) my wife (Age 37 - Stay at home mom) and our friend of 23 years (Age 36 - Insurance Agent) who was visiting from the Redding area with her 2 daughters for the holiday weekend.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note--We spoke with this witness at length, and we found him to be a good witness.  We have no idea what the observers witnessed.  PD))<n>

5/28/00 21:15|Spring (North Harris Co.)|TX|Unknown|10 minutes|Object with red/green/white light flew over Montgomery County, Tx., moving south to north...on 5/28/00|6/6/00|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/012/S12988.html|11|ndxe200005| Object with red/green/white light flew over Montgomery County, Tx., moving south to north...on 5/28/00<n> <n><n> <n><n> We live in Spring, Tx., which is near the border of Harris and Montgomery Counties, 25 mi. north of downtown Houston. At approx. 9:15pm, my sister asked to come outside to look at something in the sky - she was looking at it with naked eye and binoculars. I went outside and there it was -- approx. 20 - 30,000 feet up (about the highest a commercial jet is that you can see). The object was lit up with green, red, and white light. We couldn&#39;t make out the shape of it, being so high and far away, and object was about size of the north star on a clear night. We could tell it wasn&#39;t a jet or helicopter, as it didn&#39;t have lights that blinked like commercial aviation craft, instead the lights on it just seemed to be moving (too far away to tell if they were blinking in sequence, etc.). Through the binoculars, we could definitely see the red, green, and white lights on it, the red and green lights being brighter than the white. The craft was slowly moving north from south slowly, which we knew, because it was slowly getting dimmer as it went. We couldn&#39;t tell how many miles object was from us because of the height, but could tell it wasn&#39;t too far away -- either it wasn&#39;t that far, or it was probably very bright, which made it easier to see. We live right next to Montgomery County line, so actually, the object was over Montgomery County, approx. over The Woodlands area, when we first saw it. As we were watching this thing, something else much closer, and lower, suddenly came from the east to the west flying about the cruising speed of a helicopter, was all white (or possibly light green), and was only about 1000 ft. up, and didn&#39;t have lights of helicopter blinking, but rather just the whole thing was blinking on and off... this second craft we watched for only 10 seconds, and it just simply dissapeared...din&#39;t go behind anything obscuring our view -- we actually saw it just vanish... The first craft finally became dimmer and dimmer as it slowly moved northward over Montgomery county, till it was too far to see it anymore, and then trees, etc. were in the way.<n>
5/28/00 20:30|Decatur|TX|Changing|10 min.|Bright white elongated light in western sky over Decatur Texas.|6/6/00|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/012/S12987.html|12|ndxe200005| Bright white elongated light in western sky over Decatur Texas.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As observers were heading north out of Decatur on 287, object was noted 15 degrees above horizon, 15 degrees port. Object was white, bright, and would be covered by an aspirin tablet held at arms length. At first object appeared only slightly fuzzy, and shaped like an accent mark. It would become larger and fuzzier, as if moving in and out of focus. When fuzzier, appeared move oval and less long and slender. Length appeared to remain constant. If fat end was front, object was heading north. If fat end was arrow on clock hand, object was first observed to be pointing between 4 and 5, but attitude would vary between this attitude and pointing to just past 3:00. Object appeared to progress approximately 15 degrees toward north. Object appeared far away, like a jet or the space shuttle, but moving much more slowly relative to observers. Object&#39;s altitude varried within about 5 degrees. Motion was apparently sproadic. There was no reference object available near UFO; no clouds at all in Western or Northern sky. No high buildings, radio towers, etc. Observers lost sight of object behind a hill while on their journey.<n>
5/28/00 20:00|White Sands|NM|Light|2 hours|bright lights playing tic-tac-toe in the sky for over 2 hours|6/6/00|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/013/S13003.html|13|ndxe200005| bright lights playing tic-tac-toe in the sky for over 2 hours<n> <n><n> <n><n> At the white sands nat.l monument, twilight, as many as 6 bright orange hourglass shaped lights (individually the size of my little fingernail at arms length) appeared due south about 10 miles away, 7 of us watched them hover in place, changing formation, forming a triangles, artistic patterns, side by side pairs, stacked pairs, diamonds, we joked that it was like watching an aerial tic tac toe game. The event lasted for over 2 hours and continued even after we left the park when it closed at 10 pm. The lights were rising in altitude about 25-35 degrees off the horizon, hovering, and descending below the dunes as they changed formation. They seemed to remain only in the southern quadrant of the sky keeping the same distance from us. There was no noise and only once, for 10 minutes, did I notice 2 circling aircraft (that seemed very small compared to the lights) in their vicinity. It could have been some desert military exercises with helicopters, but I never saw any strobes or nav. lights, and the movements/formations seeemed unusual behavior for helicopters unless they were practicing for some blue-angel air-show event. It just didn&#39;t seem to be the way helicopters would support ground troops at night. The movements were not quick, but deliberate, and seemed to be precisely mathmatically coriagraphed. The lights seemed to have two stages, shaped like an hourglass, self illumined, not attached to any structural object, very intense, unwavering, steady, piercing, never did they turn off and on, turn away from us, they were always on, face to us, and only disappeared when descending below the dunes. The diamond formation was especially visually pleasing, and overall the serenity of the twilight&gt;night white sand afterglow, starlit, clear desert sky with the dancing lights made for a serene, spectacular, and awe inspired evening. There seemed to be no unusual concern, outside of the 2 briefly circling jets, from Holoman AFB five miles to the east of white sands, and after watching the strange lights for a couple of hours it just seemed as no big deal for us either, almost as commonplace as the sunset, and as beautiful. This did occur strange to me the next day when thinking about it. Hmmm...<n>
5/28/00 14:00|Maricopa|CA|Egg|1 minute|Single Oblong Object w/ dull metallic sheen spotted at high altitude and moving slowly at approx. 2pm, clear, sunny day.|6/6/00|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/013/S13002.html|14|ndxe200005| Single Oblong Object w/ dull metallic sheen spotted at high altitude and moving slowly at approx. 2pm, clear, sunny day.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A friend and I were chasing a large free flying(uncontrolled)model airplane on a cross-country duration competition flight aboard our ATC cycles. The model had reached an altitude of approx. 1500 feet and was very small in the sky which was a very clear blue with bright sunshine and high temperatures (90&#39;s).  While traveling on a trail paralleling Hwy. 118 just north of Maricopa, I noticed a very peculiar looking object just above the model in the sky but obviously at a much higher altitude and greater distance. The shape was very clearly egg-like but more symmetrical and oblong, not unlike a ball squashed down in the center viewed from the side. The color was dull silver / grey metallic that did not reflect the sunlight appreciably and at times appeared almost translucent. We stopped the bikes momentarily and I asked my buddy, &#34;what the hell is that thing above the airplane?&#34;  He said that he had no idea but that it was certainly peculiar.  We both agreed that it bore no similarity to any conventional aircraft (my buddy is a certified aircraft mechanic and pilot).  The object was moving very slowly from east to west towards Maricopa and when a jetliner appeared slightly above the object, we realized that the jet had a completely different appearance, was moving much faster and leaving a contrail. We resumed our pursuit of the model and after about a minute the object appeared to be blending into the slight haze and when I looked up again, it was gone.  The only possible explanation we both could think of was that we were seeing some kind of large high altitude research balloon (Skyhook?) because I read where these tend to condense and elongate as they reach the upper atmosphere.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Two similar reports received from Albuquerque, NM, and southeastern AZ on 03JN00, which may be related to this report.  We presume the reports were caused by a high-altitude balloon, and the witness in this case suggests, but we are not certain.  PD))<n>

I was attending the annual Country Western and Swing Dance Festival held at the Radisson Hotel a block away. There was a gentle breeze blowing from the North and the temperature was around 75 degrees.  I had been sitting in a lounge chair for nearly an hour when I decided it was time to finish up. As I rose I noticed an oblong sausage shaped dull orange light quickly pop up from behind a large bank building North of me in the downtown Fresno area. It looked like a large lumpy sausage  shaped balloon. That made no sense at all so I continued to watch it with suspicion. It rose to about 30 degrees in the night sky and no longer appeared to have the dusky illumination that caught my eye. It now appeared to be light gray and very shadowy as it approached and came even with me as I viewed it due West. This is where the description gets really weird. I have had sightings of structured craft before but nothing, never even like this, nor have I heard of anything like this. As it was due West at this time I asked myself, &#34;What the hell am I looking at?&#34;. It appeared to be a string of conjoined spheres each one pushing the next one along in an undulating formation where the one on the end would circle around and pop in at the front.  In disbelief I looked more closely and saw the spheres form into an angular formation with soft white vertices. It crossed the western sky in a smooth straight glide while continuing all this strange activity and was lost from sight at about a 45 degree inclination. The objects path spanned roughly 90 degrees of arc across the sky.  This all took place in about 30 secs. The object was as big as my thumb from tip to first knuckle at arm&#39;s distance (1.5&#34;). There was absolute silence and there was no air craft seen during the time I was out there.<n>

They traveleled much more rapidly than typical aircraft approaching LAX and Santa Monica Airport. and not in a typical LAX or SMA flight path. The aircraft were very dynamic and, while in a diamond formation, shifted ahead and behind each other, while moving consistantly eastward.<n>

PD))<n> <n><n> <n><n> Glowing object in Nassau County, NY on 5/27/00<n> <n><n> <n><n> While driving on the Southern State parkway, a large, glowing object with flashing lights along the bottom appeared in th sky.  We first thought it was an arplane or water tower, but as it got larger and closer, it appeared to have a hub or dome on the top of it.  It was dificult to view b/c we were moving on the parkway and trees were obscuring our view.  We tried to get off the parkway to retrace our steps to see it again, but it was gone.  At one point, it turned and had an ovoid shape.  The dome on the top was more visible and appeared like a circle.  The main thing about it was that it was glowing and the details viewed were a result of varying amounts of &#34;glow.&#34;  There were no definite lines that defined it.  Actually, at the exact point that we viewed this object, there was  car that had veered off the parkwa minutes before our arrival and struck a tree.  We wondered if that person had seen it too.<n>

There was at a time a helicopter was around, but helicopters look nothing like what I caught on the photo. More than anything, I am looking to see if this is a &#34;flying saucer&#34; of some type or if it can be explained as something else.

The object or craft appeared to be stationary but these lights kept moving around and around above our house. They seemed to be behind the clouds perhaps a mile above the ground. The lights were dim but could be seen through the clouds. It appeared to be very large. Maybe the size of a football field but circular.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  The report seems somewhat reminiscent of advertising lights, rotating in a circle.  However, generally the individual lights are reported to come together at a an imaginary point in the center of the circle.  We do not know what caused this incident.))<n>

I noticed over the St. Lawrence River, approximately 200-300 yards from my house and above the tree tops, a circle of dim white lights(approx. 15 lights) strobbing slowly in a counter clockwise direction. Sometimes the shaped changed from a circle of lights to a oval shape of lights. I watched it for a few minutes then got my son and husband. Together we watched it from an open window. No noise was heard. After approximately 5 min I called my neighbor who lives below me directly on the water. My neighbor also saw it at the same time then all of a sudden it disappeared, leaving no trial. My neighbor said it was about 1/3 of the way over the river which is about 1 mile wide. I sat up for the next 1 1/2 hours watching but it never returned.<n>

It did not have any blinking lights, tail or trail behind it and was absolutely silent. The object itself appeared to be dimly lit from within. We all remained silent and transfixed until it passed completely out of sight.<n>

I&#39;m a professional computer geek; doing I.T. and website design. I was outside walking to the house from my car and noticed the sky light up.  It was a bright blueish light followed by a trail of orange sparks or fire.  It lasted just for a few seconds, and I paused and listened expecting an explosion as whatever it was hit the ground.  I&#39;m near C-470 and Lucent Blvd and this was to the West of me, possibly over the mountains. At 10 pm, our local news had a story about the Space shuttle so I went to nasa&#39;s site and saw that the landing wasn&#39;t until the 29th; so that ruled that out.  I went to Art Bell&#39;s site to find your number/website and saw the Iridium satellite flare page, looked up the flares for the day and ruled that out as well. Whatever it was, it sure looked like it could have been low in altitude.  Like I said, I was waiting to hear a crash.<n>

And objects that looked  like stars but started following a plain<n> <n><n> <n><n> Hi i live in newton nh. Im realy into ufos and aliens and abductions. My girlfriend and i always go driving late at night looking for ufo&#39;s. rarely we spot any thing unusual. One night at the end of my yard out in the woods we saw a wierd bright light a solid one no blinking like plane. and no sound. so we observed it.  My girlfriend was amazed it was  jerky in movement and it would stop for about 30 sec. and keep moving. it would go up a little and move wierd no plane can do this .then finaly it was out of our sight. So we waited and it didnt come back so my girlfriend went in the house. I stayed out and waited maybe it will come back..so i waited it didnt come back. So i was looking up at stars for a wile  and i notice one moving and i thoght maybe a satilite but over more i saw an airplane flying. And i noticed 3 stars start moving after the plane flew buy them . What ever they were they seem to be following the plane. And ive seen 5 at once  moving in many directions. But i see that solid light every night i go out there. It seems like its looking for somthing or studying that area. friday 5/26/00 i was useing  my girlfriend fathers digital camcorder.I saw it again then it was gone same thing as always but maybe about 90 min later i saw it coming from over the tree a distance away so i ran down to the end of the yard and notice ther was another one closer i was shocked i turned on the camcorder then the one closer disapeared  no noise at all from neather one. If it was a plane you would here the engine. even more at night. I got scared becouse i didnt no were it went and i rans so fast in my house my girlfriend said whats wrong...i said oh my god it came back. this time there was 2.  Never saw it again that night . But I saw it again the next night. i have 1 witneses of it. And i did manage to get one on tape<n>

I looked out my window &amp; saw a black object very high in the sky. The object did not reflect the sunlight as the planes flying near-by were, nor did it have any flashing lights as all aircraft should. It was so high I could not make out the shape. It appears to be suspended from something but is way too high to be hanging. It did not seem to move. Keep in mind we were travelling at 80 MPH  &amp; my 15 yr old son &amp; I watched it for approx 45mins &amp; it was still in full view. My husband was driving but saw it as well. I have a friend who is from that area &amp; travels to Yuma once or twice or month, I asked her about the object &amp; she says her family sees it all the time. My father works for the military &amp; has a Top Secret security clearance but of course he couldn&#39;t (or wouldn&#39;t) tell me anything. I&#39;m sure it has something to do with the military (I hope) but I grew up on military bases &amp; have never noticed anything like that before.<n>

On May 26 at 9:28 p.m. I was in my back patio. As I was walking to go back inside, I looked up and saw a boomerang-shaped craft slowing gliding directly overhead. Its shape was that of a 90-degree angle, with very sharply defined, angular features, like 2 long rectangles joined to a point in the front. It had 3 large, white lights on each wing. It was the size of an index finger held arm&#39;s length, slightly smaller. My guess is that it was approximately the elevation small planes fly, traveling about 200-300 mph, and I would say it was somewhat larger than a commercial airliner, maybe twice as large. The lights were very soft looking, not bright or glaring at all. I could just make out the boomerage outline of it against the sky. If it didn&#39;t have lights, I&#39;d never have noticed it. It traveled almost directly overhead going NNW. Then 4 minutes later, to my utter amazement, ANOTHER one flew directly overhead, this one going NW. The second one was identical in every respect except that as it approached, I noticed that it looked asymetrical, with 3 lights on one side and 4 on the other, the last light on the left wing being considerably brighter. As it passed overhead, I saw that that 4th light was actually a separate object flying a short distance off the wingtip at exactly the same speed. As it flew off in the distance, that extra object kept perfect pace and distance with the boomerang. These craft were completely silent. Then, at 9:55, I saw a very bright, silvery white streak of light go across the sky in that same NW direction. I&#39;ve witnessed many meteor showers, and this wasn&#39;t one. The tail looked like light as opposed to a debris tail left by a meteor, and it dissapeared to a single point of light in the distance. On January 2 of this year, I reported another boomerang that flew overhead at this same location, which looked exactly the same except it was traveling much faster and the entire craft was much easier to see because it had a sort of florescent glow outli! ning it.<n>

I noticed it appeared to be some kind of aircraft.I rolled down my window expecting to hear some kind of noise, and it was totally silent. It sat perfectly still. As I came to a stop at the lights at Stanley Rd., I could see three bright lights, one in each corner of what was a guitar pick shape.The lights were shining straight down. It also had one small blue light in between two of the white lights. As another car approached coming south on Stanley Rd. it slowly started to drift southeast.It got maybe a mile away,and took off so fast it was quickly out of my view.I tried to point it out to the car, but it took off so fast if they didn&#39;t look as soon as I pointed they did not see it. My 7 year old daughter was very scared,and crying hysterically because she had never seen anything like that before. It was definetly nothing I have ever    seen in my 30 years of life!<n>

It was an almost pure white,but had a little silver. It didn&#39;t look as though the object was moving so I kinda thought it was a balloon but the winds were strong outside so if it was a balloon it would have moved faster, but in the sky it was the size of a balloon about 50 meters up...when the coulds moved towards it I saw that the clouds were below it and not above!! that&#39;s when I knew it had to be big,and that it was not a natural craft that you see above the clouds!{it looked about the distance a large jetliner would normally be above the clouds}..I tryed to show my family members but when I looked up I had lost it! and I knew the cloud that it was behind..so it had to move fast when I was not looking for the 5 seconds!!<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Please see report from Ketchikan, AK, for same date.

5/25/00 19:40|Burr Ridge|IL|Triangle|1 minute|Black Triangle Floats over treeline|2/18/01|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/016/S16111.html|34|ndxe200005| Black Triangle Floats over treeline<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was spending some time visiting at my parent&#39;s home in Burr Ridge, IL while on break from my job as a limousine driver.  It was around 8:00 PM and the sky was a dark blue, but not yet completely black.  I was lying on the couch watching TV when I heard an eerie sound coming from outside.  The sound was similar to the hydraulic sound made by a garbage truck when it is compacting garbage.  My mother who was in the room with me walked over to the backyard deck to investigate the sound.  Her voice sounded frightened as she yelled, &#34;Come here quick!  Triangle!  Triangle&#34;;  I was a bit confused, but I got up and looked into the south sky where she was pointing.  There I saw an object in the sky that I have never seen before.  The object was a large, black, equilateral triangle with rounded corners flying horizontal in the sky.  The best analogy of its shape would be to take a sheet of black Styrofoam two inches thick and cut it out like a cookie cutter using a rack from a billiard table.  On each of the three rounded corners, there was a red, glowing light.  Unlike an electric light, this red light had a larger diameter and a uniform glow- like a glowing ball of gas.  On the underside of the vehicle, there was a very large diameter (about 20ft) white light, which appeared to be recessed.  The light was very bright, but did not illuminate what appeared to be the matte black finish of the object itself.  I witnessed no flashing lights of any kind on the object.  .  Based on my proximity to the object, I would estimate that each of the three sides on this object was 90 to 100 ft. long.  The object was flying north and coming straight toward our house.  At no point was the object more than 40 ft. above the tree line.  Approximately 100 ft. before reaching our house, the vehicle made a sharp left turn without banking (staying perfectly horizontal) and proceeded west.  The object then began to descend slightly and disappeared from view over the tree line.  The noise it created faded away second! s later. 	 	     After the object disappeared from sight, we stayed out for about five minutes to see if we could get another glimpse of it, but it did not return.  We called the non-emergency number for our municipality but all we got was a recorded message.  We considered calling the police, but my father insisted that we don&#39;t because of all the paperwork that would be involved and for fear of ill gossip and public opinions in our community.  I know that if the situation were reversed, I would probably think that a person who claimed to see such an unusual object were either crazy or they misinterpreted what they saw.   For eighteen years I lived very close to Chicago&#39;s Midway Airport and for the last three years I have spent countless hours at the airport as limousine driver.  I have seen every type of flying machine imaginable.  The object I witnessed that night was unlike any object I have ever seen or heard.<n>

Observed 2 large black/dark green helicopters with 2 propellers front and back flying south app. 500 ft altitude, offset by 1-2 copter lengths.  No markings.  Director of global support sitting in seat in front of me.  I said, &#34;((name deleted)), look at the military helicopters&#34;.  He was on the cell phone.  Most others were asleep around.  At this point I noticed a huge silver disk shaped object, metallic in nature, brilliantly reflecting sunlight, hovering at about 9-10,000 ft. above Dallas Love Field airport.   The copters were flying directly toward it.  ((name deleted)) then looked at the copters.   I said, &#34;what is that above them&#34;.  He said, &#34;something is flying above&#34;. I said, &#34;I think it is a UFO&#34;.  At this point, we both stared out the bus window transfixed.  I was determined not to take my eyes off it.  I should have yelled &#34;UFO&#34;, because there were at least 5 video cameras and 20 cameras on the bus, but I couldn&#39;t take my eyes off it. I know the object was extremely large, because eventually the helicopters were directly under it, in the same formation, and the diameter of the disk was larger than from  the back of the trailing helicopter to the front of the leading one.  This was actual, not apparent.  and the copters were about 8500-9500 feet below.   I haven&#39;t done the math on this yet, but if the length of that type of copter can be found, a reasonable estimate of the actual size of the craft can be derived. It was magnificent and beautiful. About 30 seconds after the copters were directly under it, it disappeared.  I wasn&#39;t even blinking, let alone looking away, and it simpy disappeared. The copters were out-of-sight in a few seconds after. Note:  altitude estimate derived from knowledge of meteorology and the apparent shrinkage of the copters as they approached it, time of day, and relative sizes of airplanes coming in and out of Love Field.   Sunny, sparse fair-weather cumulus clouds. I work for a Swedish telecom company (16 years).  Job title: Master Engineer. This event happened yesterday afternoon.<n>

This is in &#34;Valle&#34; arizona at the intersection of hwy 64 &amp; hwy 180.  I went outside to urinate at 2:30 in the morning.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Directly at about 40 deg.in the eastern night sky was a very bright object somewhat round. It was stunningly noticeable as it was shaking somewhat violently kind of reminded of the way a &#34;bumble bee&#34; moves in flight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first I took it to be a regular type of aircraft.  I thought I might have to help the occupants of a aircrash because I thought this aircraft was in trouble.  that was until it came to a complete halt.  At that point I knew this thing was special.  In this area it is extremely quiet especially at night, There was absolutely no sound to this vehicle.  At times it seemed to move from this halted position.  I could not detect how it got from A to B but I could tell it was not staying put.  Its luminescent quality would jump in magnatude for a very brief period. I could tell this light could light up the sky if it wanted to.  You could sense it tremendous power.  The lighted object did not &#34;bumble&#34; after the initial sighting.Later two other object much more faint but with exactly the same luminescence came close to the original object and banked at 45 deg angle at a ridiculously fast rate of speed (like lightning)sped off and dissapered.  When the objects got close to eachother they seemed to exchange energy sort of like static electricity in a way.  The main object seemed to climb but very slowly.  It stayed in position in the same portion of the sky but more like 70 deg.  It was still there very bright but seemed higher and farther away.  It was there when the sun came up and all other stars etc, where long gone. I did not see it leave.  I went to work in Williams, AZ. and left the scene. This area has a wonderful black night sky with many bright stars.  The main object was the brightest object in the sky. It had none of the usual red and green beacons as on regular aircraft. No sound, this area is so quiet you can hear an airplane many miles away if it is flying by.  I noticed I had a hard time telling how close it was. Could of been 10, 20  or 50 miles away or maybe 3.  It was hard to tell. Its light was backlit like a stage light. Definately not an incandescent beam (like an aircraft or car) I will never forget it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD))<n>

Shasta, California -everyday. It takes still shots and then puts them together in the form of an .Mpeg files (size 520K). We used to live up there and we love the mountain and surrounding scenery. It brings back lots of memories. ANYWAYS, when ((name deleted)) checked the .mpeg movie for yesterday (5-24-00), there was a strange object to the right of Mt. Shasta in the film -near it&#39;s beginning. Each frame is taken 10 minutes apart from each other for a daily movie of 102 frames. It looks to me like an upside-down tear shaped object that is spinning. You see it in frames that have no clouds and in frames with clouds. AND it is moving in a northeasterly direction while the clouds are clearly moving in a SOUTHeasterly direction.

5/23/00 23:00|Cleveland|TN|Triangle|????|I went back to bed.|3/2/04|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/035/S35113.html|40|ndxe200005| I went back to bed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Cleveland Tennessee is a small town approximately thirty five miles from Chattanooga, North on Interstate 75. The house that I resised, when this happened, was across the street from Cleveland Hardwick Air Field. A small General Aviation Air Port. On the night of 23 May, 2000, My, then, wife woke me by climbing out of bed saying,&#34;Their here!&#34; I awoke to the entire roon bathed in a lite blue light. There was no light sorce in the room to create the light. On her side of the bed there was a small metal framed window. I got up and walked around the end of the bed. I was amazed at the amount of lightin the room. The double pane glazing was of a cheap design and moisture had seeped in. This caused the window to be less than transparient. A common in that part of the couontry. To see what was causing the light she opened the window. The slide wasn&#39;t exactly smooth, and the window banged open when she forced it. I scolded her for making noise, and possibly compromising our position. Wanting to remain anonymous. I had to bend down to look out of the lower protion of the window. Hovering over an airplane hanger not twenty five yards away, completely mationless and noiseless was a craft. Five brilliantly lit, half spheres, in a circular pattern where protruding from the bottom. The illumination was so bright it was difficult to see much of the craft. However, I could just make out the triangular shape. The sides were verticaly flat, with ridges running horizontally. It appeared to be black. However, dure to the brightness I can&#39;t be sure. I looked at the craft long enough to make these observations. Then the most extraordinary thig happened. I closed the window and went back to bed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I say this was extraordinary because I just saw something I&#39;ve wondered about all my life and I just turned my back and went back to bed! I didn&#39;t take a picture. I didn&#39;t call anyone. I didn&#39;t go out side to get a better look. I just closed the window, walked around the bed, got in, and went to sleep.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It wasn&#39;t until the next evening that I mentioned it to my wife. Atfirst she just looked at me like I had lost my mind. Then she said that she had a dream just like that. The window being banged open is what she remembered. She also said that she remembered a person standing across the street looking at our house. I didn&#39;t see anyone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is true as I remember it. I have no reason to fabricate this story.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  Source of report occupies position of considerable responsibility, involving considerable detail.

It was pretty scary as there was no explanation of what the lights were, it wasnt a particularly cloudy night, there were clouds in the sky, but this was in a cloud, and there were aeroplanes flying alot higher than this, i couldnt say how high off the ground, but it was definitly in the sky at some height! Im not a crackpot or a ufo freak, but did see something that was definitly unexpaneable! The light was white/greyish type of light!<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We have received other, similar reports of this kind of formation of lights, and we do not know what they are.  If they are advertising lights, we are not familiar with this type of formation.  Usually, advertising light in the U. S. are four lights, which rotate around a center point.  Other types we have encountered are either red or green lasers, projected as single, double, or quadruple beams.  Our experience suggests that UFO&#39;s are generally are not visible for the length of time indicated in this report.  PD))<n>

It was approximate 3-4 stories high (in relation to a building) and sat there silent. It emitted 3 dim beams of light downward while it also had a &#34;plus&#34; shape of lights in a row of 3 one way and 4 the other way. As I watched it, it gently moved away from me, and made no noise at all. It did not speed away, it barely moved. Very interesting. Not in a flight pattern as I had just come from the airport and flew in from Chicago as well.<n>
5/23/00 20:15|Tulsa|OK|Circle|2.5 minutes|I saw a light traveling directly overhead,silently at 3000 ft.|8/5/01|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/017/S17907.html|43|ndxe200005| I saw a light traveling directly overhead,silently at 3000 ft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> First of all, I must say that i am a little confused about the exact date because I have waited approximately one year from date of incident.  I did not know who to report this to until I found this website and thought it important to report it even at this late date.  What I am not confused about, or my two sons, is what we saw.  We saw one night just before dark between the dates May 19 and May 27 2000, approximately May 23 a very strange circular light traveling in the sky at approximately 3000 ft. altitude, from east northeast to west southwest.  This light appeared diffused, but was obviously at a low level altitude.  The light was mostly white to pink in color and very odd.  Having been raised one mile from an airport and an Air National Gaurd airbase, as well as a father with 40 years aircraft mechanic experience and myself as a aircraft mechanic in the airforce, I have seen most every imaginable aircraft known to man.  This craft, or light, was obviously a UFO.  The sky in the backdrop was near dusk and virtualy cloudless.  The flight path that this was on carried it directly overhead.  As it approached I noticed there was no sound whatsoever.  Being alarmed by this I sent my youngest boy running in the house to retrieve a disposable camera that unfortunatly was in my vehicle at my wifes work.  As my child went to retrieve camera my other son and I continued to keep our eyes trained on said craft.  It continued its path diligently without variance.  I followed it with my eyes as far as I could until it dissapeared.  When it dissapeared I immediately went to the middle of the street looking up and down searching for someone else who seen this.  Unfortunately, there was no one.  I will conclude by saying this:  This was a UFO.  Not only to me, but to anyone who would have saw it on this earth.  Also, having lived in this town for 38 years I have learned the flight paths of aircraft in this area.  In my three years living at this house I have never seen an airplane, helicopter, durigable, or any o! ther cra ft fly in this direction.  Especially at that altitude.  For the last year I have dilligently watched the sky looking for a craft flying this direction.  To no avail.  But I gotta tell ya, the no noise thing to this day gives me goosebumps.  Please don&#39;t think were crazy, we are really very normal people and have been very hesitant in discusing this with anyone.  Please feel free to contact me anytime and I will discuss this in greater detail if needed.  Thank you.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

Then I thought that it could have been a sattelite, but it was a cloudy night. I could see no stars. The object was headed East, North East, at a very fast rate. I detected it when it was directly North of me, and followed it untill it disapeared over the trees. it took about 5-10 seconds to disapper. It must have been going about 4 times as fast as any aircraft I have ever seen. We have the Wright Patterson Air Force Base here in Dayton, so I have seen some pretty quick aircraft, but this thing was faster then ANYTHING I have ever seen in the sky before. Just wanted to let you know what I saw. - You can contact me at ((contact information deleted)) Thank you, ((name deleted))<n>

At that point I stared at it for a good 5 seconds and then it shot off towrds the east. I had a buddy who saw it driving in from another Highway.  He said it looked liked a meteor.

Just after the sun set, around 7:00 pm we witnessed 14 to 16 luminous sphere like objects in the sky for one hour.  They would slowly fly across the sky, change direction and then reappear in another portion of the sky altogether.  At one point a sphere &#34;flashed&#34; us appearing to have increaded tremendously in size briefly in an intense flash.  We were able to clearly discern these objects from other meteor &#34;shooting stars&#34; that evening which were occasionally present as well.  This event took place in a clear night sky without the moon, which rose hours later.  The &#34;flash&#34; occured when I directed a question  internally whether this could be my imagination.  A few of the individuals in the group had other sightings but most of the group had never seen anything like this before.  It was an entirely fascinating and extraordinary event which covered three days in total as one person in the grop had a contact experience the night before in the high andean village we stayed at before the ascent to the plateau, and again the following two nights on the mountain.  We later learned of another group near Mt. Adams (Washington State), witnessed by reporter Michael Miley of UFO Magazine,  had a sighting similar to our on the following days of May 23 and 24.  Both sightings were witnessed by numerous individuals.<n>

I thought it was a helicopter, it was moving very fast. I said &#34;look at that helicopter.&#34; But as I watched it streaked by i realized it was not a helicopter. It left a small white spark behind the light and dissapeared. It was not a meteor, it left no trail. Except for the small spark. It was definately a green light. This was at 3:30am and I also noticed helicopters flying around the area. I wondered why they were flying around that late at night. it was odd seeing that bright green light streaking across the sky. Again it had no tail or trail.<n>

I was sleeping she say&#39;s the craft was triangle in shape. It had a large round light in center and a number of smaller light&#39;s around the edges. It was dark in shape. The lights at the corners blinked seperate from the other lihgt in between at the edges. They blinked at different times. The light in the middle stayed on constantly. All lights were white in color no other color&#39;s noted. It moved southwest to northeast. She tells me it took two to three minutes to move across her field of site. Last night was clear and had a long range of view, all stars were and bright out. She is deaf and could not hear if it was making any noise. She say&#39;s it was flying very low to the ground 300 to 500 feet off ground. It was approx: 150 feet in size, lager then a 757.  This is the best I can do translate for her.<n>

THERE SUDDENLY APPEARED IN THE BLACK BACKGROUND OF SPACE, A SILVERY DISK WITH A SLIGHT DOME ON TOP, TILTED DOWN ABOUT 30^ .  THE TOP SURFACE  HAD A SILVERY RIPPLE , OR RINGS,   LIKE WHEN YOU DROP A PEBBLE IN A POND, MAKING A RINGS OR RIPPLE EFFECT.  IT APPEARED  JUST TO THE RIGHT OF THE SHUTTLE IN CLEAR VIEW AND  IT STAYED FIXED IN THAT SPOT FOR A FEW SECONDS (MAYBE 10 SEC.OR SO) THEN IT SEEM TO MOVE INSTANTLY  OFF TO THE LEFT AND DISAPPEAR BEHIND SHUTTLE/ISS.     I  COULDN&#39;T BELIEVE WHAT I WAS SEEING. THE IMAGE OF THE BRIGHT SILVER DISK WAS VERY SHARP AND DISTINCT, IN FACT IT WAS MORE DEFINED THAN THE IMAGE OF THE ASTRONAUGHTS HANGING ON TO THE SPACE STATION.   A MINUTE OR TWO LATER, AS I CONTINUED WATCHING WITH GREAT ANTICIPATION, ANOTHER BRIGHT LIGHT APPEARED  BUT TO THE LEFT OF THE SPACE STATION (ISS),  BUT IT SEEMED TO BE FURTHER AWAY AND NOT AS SHARP.   IT ALSO STAYED FIXED FOR A FEW SECONDS THEN IT SUDDENLY BLINKED OUT AND DISAPPEARED.   ALL OF THIS TOOK PLACE DURING THE TIME THE ASTRONAUGHTS  BEGAN WORKING ON THE SHUTTLE ARM (RUSSIAN CRANE ARM) ON THE OUTSIDE OF THE SHUTTLE AND BEFORE THEY RETURNED TO THE SHUTTLE BAY.    IF THE CAMERA TAKING THE PICTURES WAS ON THE INSIDE OF THE SHUTTLE IT MAY HAVE BEEN A REFLECTION OF SOMETHING FROM THE INSIDE GLASS.   I WISH I HAD A COPY OF THE NASA BROADCAST OF DAY 3 TO REPLAY.   IF YOU KNOW  ANYONE WHO RECORDS NASA BROADCASTS PLEASE LET ME KNOW.   THE FIRST PERSON I THOUGHT OF WAS RICHARD HOAGLAND BUT I DON&#39;T HAVE AN E-MAIL ADDRESS FOR  HIM. I HAVE SINCE BEEN CONTACTED BY ANOTHER GENTLEMAN WHO SAYS HE SAW APPROXIMATELY THE SAME THING I SAW.  IF ANYONE ELSE SAW  WHAT I DESCRIBED PLEASE CONTACT ME.   I HAVE SEEN A REPORT ON &#34;WWW.SIGHTINGS.COM&#34; WHO OBSERVED BRIGHT LIGHTS APPEARING NEAR THE TAIL OF THE SHUTTLE.  A UFO RESEARCHER SENT ME A SEQUENCE OF STILL PICTURES SHOWING A BRIGHT LIGHT THAT LOOKED LIKE THE BRIGHT FUZZY LIGHT I REPORTED.   IF  ANYONE ELSE HAS ANY OPINION OR INFORMATION,  I WOULD APPRECIATE HEARING FROM YOU.  I WOULD LIKE TO KNOW IF ANYONE ELSE SAW SOMETHING SIMILAR. THANKS.

We were watching for some kind of navigational lights, there wasn&#39;t any..  It was as bright as Jupiter and it was a quarter inch long at arm&#39;s length.<n>

May 20 I was outside on my porch when I noticed an object coming from the SW and going to the NE. When first seen it was about 12 to 15 miles away and travelling at a high rate of speed at an altitude of between 500 and 1000 ft. I could not make out the shape but observed 6 or 7 bright white,randomly strobing lights in a horizontal line. The object continued on to a point beyond Saddleback Butte where it mad an abrupt 45 degree tun and headed to the north, still at a high rate of speed. It was at such a low altitude that it went behind two small rises in the butte. It continued noth for about a half a mile and made an abrupt 90 degree turn and came towards me. It then changed into one extremely bright white light and went down at a 60 degree angle, not reducing speed, dissapearing below a rise in the terrain that is about 200 to 300 feet higher in elevation than I am.My wife only observed the last 10 seconds as the object descended to the ground. This area is about 3 miles south of the boundary of Edward&#39;s AFB.<n>
5/20/00 20:20|Santa Clarita|CA|Light|3 mins|My family and I saw 4 bright steaks of light in the same exact area of the sky all which traveled in opposite directions..|6/6/00|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/012/S12929.html|57|ndxe200005| My family and I saw 4 bright steaks of light in the same exact area of the sky all which traveled in opposite directions..<n> <n><n> <n><n> Last night my Father (a retired Lockheed employee and WW2 Army/Airforce Vet)was setting in a lawn chair in my backyard when he said to me,&#34;Do you have Fireflys around here?&#34; I told him &#34;no&#34; And saw he was looking into the southern part of the sky. I then walked over to him and looked into the sky and asked him what he saw. He said he saw a streak of light in the sky that looked like a Firefly. I then looked in the direction he was looking and suddenly I saw a quick, Bright streak of light that was very thin moving from West to East. I said that looks like a meteor. about 30 seconds later, another streak of light was in the exact area but this time it went from east to west. I was then kind of freaked out to see the same thing, in the exact area but going the opposite direction. At that time my Mother, my Brother and his Girlfriend walked over to see what we were looking at when the same streak of light appeared again, This time going from North to south in the same exact area. We were all wondering what we were seeing. I attempted to explain it as a meteor shower but we all agreed it would not be in the exact same area in the sky. About 1 minute passed when we then saw a bright strobe type flash in the sky Just south and lower in the horizon from where we saw the steaks of light. about 5 seconds later, another flash of light appeared futher south and even lower in the horizon. We continued to look into the sky for several more minutes when we once again saw the bright flash of light, This time is was towards the east of the other light flashes. It was now we all realized that this was no meteor shower so I ran in to get the Video Camera. Unfotunately we never saw the objects again. I can only describe the steaks of light as &#34;Pencil thin&#34;,White Streaks with no contrails. They only went a distance of your hand streached out in the sky. All 4 steaks of light (3 which I saw)were within an area of the sky where as if you were to hold out both hands and make a circle with your thumbs and pinky fingers. The l! ight str eaks appeared to be &#34;way up&#34; in the atmosphere and traveled at least 5 times faster than any meteor or falling star that I have ever seen. The 3 bright flashes we saw resembled an Aircraft Stobe light but about 3 times brighter. At about 2030hrs I telephoned the nearest Air Force Base (Edwards AFB)which is about 70 miles away. I spoke to a person at their command post who said he had no idea what I saw and that no information about any flight testing or Military operations could be given out. He then gave me the phone number to the UFO reporting center. I then called the reporting center and spoke with Mr. Davenport and told him about the incident. He said that what I saw was very unusual and was not from &#34;This earth&#34;. What my family and I saw last night was definately the most unusual thing we have ever saw. We believe the &#34;Sightings&#34; were of alien nature but we are not really sure. My wife was in the house during the time of the incident and now she thinks im crazy. All I can say is that &#34;I saw what I saw&#34; and I&#39;m not &#34;Crazy&#34;. I am a Deputy Sheriff in the Southern California area and have seen strange things before, but not like this!<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  NUFORC Director talked with the witness at some length, and found him to be a seemingly very good observer and reporter of fact.  His description of the event was very precise, and he had made a note of the exact time of the event.<n> <n><n> <n><n> If we led the individual to believe that we concluded the phenomenon was UFO-related, we misspoke, and apologize.  We have no idea what caused this phenomenon.  PD))<n>

When we approached the Mercury Blvd. overpass on I-64N. I noticed a craft off to the left. I thought it was a pair of fighter craft in close formation as we were near the flight path of Langley Airforce base and sometimes two jets on approach blend into a strange shape. It became apparent that the object was not jets and not as far away as I first thought and it was a singular object, rather oblong and cylindrical or boxy with a smaller boxy protrusion about midway down the length off to our right. It was hard to determine how fast it was going as we were in a moving car, but it appeared to be floating as a balloon would. I would estimate the object was approximately 30-40 feet long and between 6-10 tall. It appeared to be dark gray and there were no lights on it at all that we could see. We were probably about 500 yards away at closest approach and it appeared to be about 100-150 feet up in the air.  There was a local police car stopped by the overpass and we later wondered if he has seen this as well and was taking a look at it.  Unfortunately, I wasn&#39;t able to get a good look at the object and am primarily interested in if anyone else saw this and knew what it was...I&#39;ve seen many a strange thing in the sky over the years but most if not all I could explain away after a short time. This object has me bamboozelled as to what it was.<n>

I watched the shadows of the clouds drift across the athletic field in front of me. They moved slowly and the large cloud shadows moved in unison. Without immediately realizing it a smaller &#34;cloud&#34; shadow crossed the field moving in the same general direction but considerably faster. Then I realized this shadow was almost perfectly circular. It was about twenty feet in diameter. The circular cloud shadow was almost to the end of the field when I jumped out of my car and scanned the sky overhead to see what made that distinct shadow. No matter where I looked I couldn&#39;t find the object that made the shadow. The shape continued past the field and over the roofs of the distant houses and out of sight. The circular shadow&#39;s shape and intensity stay constant through out the sighting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

I heard an airplane noise coming from behind me (I sat facing directly west). After scanning the skies briefly and seeing no plane, my eyes fell upon a long, white or light silver colored object gliding quickly, steadily from northwest to south east. I probably watched it for 10, maybe even 15 seconds. It seemed to fade in and out of visibility, but would always be where it should have been on a regular path. It did not reappear where it had disappeared. Then a small plane did fly over, and the object disappeared for good, but it was clear that the object was lower than the plane. It was a light sunny day, few clouds. It was clear that the object had been traveling faster than the airplane (some sort of small plane) was. I did not point this out to anyone in the crowd, and evidently i was the only one who noticed. The object left no contrail.<n>

I know what a fighter jet looks like at 600 MPH and the sound it makes.

More than likely the object is 4-6 feet in diameter.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))<n>

The time, direction, and duration are all consistent with satellites.  We have no explanation for why they would cause dogs to howl, but that may be a coincidence.

There is no such time on the military clock.))<n> <n><n> <n><n> Distant lights cross the Stars in Kansas,They Weave and Glow,What are They?<n> <n><n> <n><n> These objects crossed the sky from west to east and they flew across at intervals of about 3 minutes between each object, and objects took about  1 minute to cross the sky from horizon to horizon, then another would appear. The objects were at an extremely high altitude perhaps   10,000 to  45,000 feet  so that of course not visible except for the dim yellowish to orange glow,,, they seemed to weave in and out and to slow slightly but always kept a general course of west to east. There was one which flew from north to south. These  objects only had one light and it changed intensity slightly and all exhibited a  weaving motion instead flying in straight lines like most aircraft.  Also when the second brighter orange light passed over, the dogs around a  2 square mile area and across the river , began to howl ,,,but it was a strange howl like they were real scared , not like they were howling at the moon, but like they sensed it passing over, then they stopped as it disappeared to the east into the darkness.<n>

They appear brighter than stars or aircraft and remain stationary for 15-20 minutes before vanishing, sometimes appearing in another location.When viewed with a 200x zoom lense they appear to pulsate from orange,amber to red in a random pattern. Last night I videotaped three of them west of Cocoa, toward Orlando. During the sightings, there is often a sudden burst of activity of aircraft swarming the area near the lights, in pairs,leaving within 1/2 hour after the sighting is over and regular air traffic patterns resume.<n>

Hovering and dancing lights, round shape object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was looking at the sky and saw what I thought was two airplaines, but one seemed to be much higher than the other.  As I kept observing, the one moved on and the other seemed to be moving very slow and then pretty much stayed in the same area and seemed to be hovering.  After several minutes, I went in and got my binoculars, which is all I own. When I zeroed in on the subject it had all of these wild dancing mostly straight dancing lines.  As I made the subject bigger, it appeared to be round in shape with a lot of white lights on the bottom of it, and appeared to have red and green lights around the outer edge, but the lights were stationary.  Then I would take it down to a  size of a pin point and the lights were all over the place (dancing again).  I did this several times, and the same thing would happen. After two hours of watching this, I was too tired to stay up any longer. Could this have been a satellite of some sort?  Do have the information of what may have been flying around at that time?<n>

In the sky, very low, was  a diamond shaped object completely covered with smaller white lights. This object would have been slightly larger than a full moon. It was very overcast, but no rain. There were many cars pulled off the road viewing this object. I and a friend left after 10 minutes of viewing this object. There must be others that have reported this, because it was just too obvious. No Noise what so ever!<n>

At first I thought it was a plane way out in the distance but then it stopped and just hung there, then proceeded again in the same direction it was originally moving. It was a whitish light just like a star and was pretty far away. I would imagine that when I started watching it, it was over the ocean off the Marin coast. Anyway, after it started moving again it seemed to arc upward a bit and then descend again. Then it stopped a second time. When it started moving again it went almost straight upward for a couple of seconds then moved down and continued on it&#39;s original path. I knew then that it was not a plane and I don&#39;t think satellites stop like this. It soon disappeared from my view as there was another building close by that blocked my sight. When I last saw it it would have been off the coast of Ocean Beach in San Francisco from what i could tell.<n>
5/17/00 21:54|Bay City|OR|Oval|15 seconds|Two large oval lights, side by side, like giant headlights in the sky.  There was aircraft noise at 10:02pm I saw the lights at 9:45pm|6/6/00|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/012/S12967.html|69|ndxe200005| Two large oval lights, side by side, like giant headlights in the sky.  There was aircraft noise at 10:02pm I saw the lights at 9:45pm<n> <n><n> <n><n> It looked like two oval headlights, side by side, up in the sky.  Very large spheres about 35 degrees above the western horizon.  I looked up at them from my parked car and in a few moments they both disapeared like lights shutting off.  I drove forward, I don&#39;t know, I wanted to follow them, the one on the left appeared again like someone turned the light back on.  This one lasted just for a couple of seconds then disapeared.  It was a very clear night, and was nearly a full moon.  As soon as I saw the second light go out I looked at the clock in my car and it read 9:54pm  I backed up back to my driveway and ran into the house to tell my husband what I saw.  The lights were sphere shaped and almost had a halo of light going through the center of them.  They were very bright and very large.  They had no noise.  At 10:02 we heard what sounded like jet noises.  Like airforce jets make.  We looked and looked and did not see any jets.  I received a phone call from my sister in-law and was telling her what had just happed.  The telephone started making noise like she had hit a bunch of numbers or re-dial.  I got mad at her because I thought she was making fun of me.  I then gave the phone to my husband because I did not want to talk to her if she was going to make fun of me and later she and he both said the same thing happened on the phone with them too.  The phone conversation was fairly short.  I then spoke to my brother &amp; other sister in-law about it ( on the phone) and shortly thereafter decided to call the local radio station.  A man answered and I asked him if anyone had reported any strange lights around the bay that evening.  He said no in a funny tone so I said thanks and no more.  My husband and I decided to surf the net to see if we could find anything (this was about 15 min after the last conversation with my brother) and the computer was acting funny.  Things were not transmitting properly.  We were having a hard time getting the mouse cursor to stay where we put it.  I kept moving back down o! n it&#39;s o wn if we moved it up.  We gave up on trying to search anymore on the net.  I live less than half a block to the end of the bay.  The lights were high up and standing still.  I have never seen anything like this in my life and was awe struck. I was so glad to see our local newspaper report four other women and a man saw them too.  I was starting to think my family was going to think I was crazy!<n>

I&#39;ll do my best here. At aproximately 9:00 PM Pacific, a business partner and I were travleing west on Stockdale Hwy just before Montclair, when my partner said what is that and I said what, he pointed to the sky to the West just dew north and I said it was an airplane and I was trying to get a better look and still drive. I was thinking what is this thing doing, there is no airport any where close and this thing was like hovering around what I thougt to be 200-300 feet high it set there probably around maybe five seconds and it began to turn North we turned right immediatley and tried to follow it(It did not just disapear but it accelerated very quickly from hovering, also it was like it did not hardly tilt to make its turn)at this point we could make out the shape pretty good. If you could picture one of those little airplanes that have the big wing in the back that look like they fly backwards like a craft with three fusolages but maybe even like one of those three sided bumerangs the nerf type. It seemed to be around the size of a McDonald Douglas Super 80 It had bright white lights all the way around all three sides like landing lights and one red rotating light on what I call the back around 10-15 total lights(all three sides looked the MDS80 size. Rather large to be hovering with no audible noise) and it like started flying right over the neighborhood not fast at all kind of slowly, continueing its turn to the North that ended it up heading more West than North we followed it through the neighborhood for as long as we could see it, which was about 15 seconds we never seen it go higher but it like just disapeared, we even drove to a clear spot on Easton Drive which is about a mile north of Stockdale Hwy and could see to the North and the West clearly but it was no where to be seen.<n>

There was no sound. After some time to think about what I had seen, and after discussing it with my husband, I decided to report this sighting, and to ask is there were similiar sightings st this time.<n>

When I finally got a real good look at it,this thing was totally illuminated(the entire &#34;body&#34; was white/gray, like the full moon on a clear evening) it had a row of white stobing lights on it top and bottom, it was totally white, no other colors. It was very low in the sky, and was moving at a medium speed, it was shaped like a football, it was the strangest and most spectacular thing that I have ever seen in the sky. Unfortunately, I could not pull over and get out of my truck to see if it made any noise, and I did not have a CB in the cab to ask othet truckers out there if they were seeing the same bright object that I was. All I know, I used to be in the USAF and this object was definitely NOT an airplane or a blimp, like I said, it was totally illuminated and I did not see any wings or stabilizers or a cockpit, it shone like the full moon, with strobing white lights<n>

(since I live in Houston, I have no idea of the zip code or county) It was egg shaped except that it had a flat top. I was able to make a good determination of its size by watching it fly through clouds. The result- 5 feet tall, 2 feet wide. I only observed it for a minute, but it seemed to be flying parallel to the plane. Whenever the plane would turn, it would stay in the same place. It sped up sometimes, and I lost sight of it about 30 seconds before we landed. I was able to determine that it was a real object (because of the clouds), but it could be a strange remotely piloted terrestrial craft. However, I could not determine the object&#39;s propulsion system, and I don&#39;t think something that size can fly that fast. I made sound observations, and there&#39;s no question in my mind that I saw a solid object that wasn&#39;t an airplane. But here&#39;s the problem- I was reading Above Top Secret by Timothy Good on the flight. I don&#39;t think it impaired my ability to see, but Phil Klass might say otherwise.<n>

I was facing north and it was a semi clear night with lots of small clouds.  I was ready to get up and head home and noticed something which I thought were clouds moving above a taller apt. building.  I realized what I was looking at weren&#39;t clouds but a craft of some sorts.  This was the best view I had of this craft. Even with an excellent veiw of this, I became terrified when I could not identify it, and was able to continue viewing it as it nearly flew above me.  It was traveling south (up pine st. just a half block to my left)  and low to the ground (1000 ft)  having no sound, and a smooth fast flight path.  It was black and white (or grey).  I remember thinking it was odd because at times all i could see were the lighter parts,  it blened well with the few clouds out that night.  My first idea  was, that it was a stealth plane.  It seemed to be the only match as in size shape.  It disappeared from my sight (the apartment buildings blocked my vision from it).   An intense fear over came me, due to having a good look at something so unfamiliar.  I was extremely close to an unexplainable craft. (?) I had dismissed the sighting as perhaps a hang-glider.  When telling this to friends and family, they say that a hang glider would be unlikely.  (what are the likely chances of some one hang gliding or gliding over that area that time of night?)  When reading a recent sighting on www.ufobc.org web site, &#34;2000 - Boomerang-shaped Craft Over North Vancouver &#34; It re-created the experience for me, and every description in that article, along with the date and time is too close for comfort to forget about.  I beleive the incident is related.  I may have seen it after the witnesses claim to, in the afore mentioned article.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We will direct the witness to UFOBC in Vancouver, B.C..  PD))<n>
5/15/00 23:30|Cleveland (approaching)|OH|Teardrop|3-4 seconds|Near miss - a UFO shot out from under our MD-80 and made a ninety degree turn off our right wing.|12/2/00|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/014/S14342.html|78|ndxe200005| Near miss - a UFO shot out from under our MD-80 and made a ninety degree turn off our right wing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My wife and I were on a TWA MD-80 from Phoenix, through St Louis to Cleveland, Ohio in May of this year (2000). As we were approaching Cleveland from the west, it was night (nearly midnight), but there must have been a full moon as we could clearly see the clouds below and around us. I don&#39;t think we had really begun our decent yet. We were sitting on the right side of the plane and were both looking out the window at the clouds, when suddenly something crossed our path. The MD-80 didn&#39;t even wiggle, so I don&#39;t know if they saw it. It came from our left and shot out from below and forward of our plane, going off to the right. I would say it was about 50 yards off our wing and forward of us. It lifted it&#39;s right side, then it smoothly lowered the right and lifted it&#39;s left side, and then  shot past us going in the opposite direction of our plane. This whole maneuver took about 3 second to accomplish. It was almost in slow motion, but it accelerated past us very quickly. We saw the following: 1.    No obvious wings 2.    It was rounded across the front 3.    It was more or less flat (not like paper) but it definitely had a low profile. 4.    There were no vertical stabilizers or fins. 5.    The tail appeared to be sort of flat not rounded like the front. 6.    It was sort of oblong (not round like a saucer). 7.    There were no obvious individual lights, but the whole craft glowed with a brilliant white light. 8.    There were no engines visible. 9.    We saw nothing that would suggest an exhaust or jet nozzle. 10.  We could hear nothing, but then we were in an MD-80 going 500mph at the time. 11.  We saw nothing that looked like numbering or letters of any kind. This was all amazing enough to see, but what was really amazing I did not realize until it was over and I had a chance to think about it some. This thing crossed our path and completed nearly a ninety degree turn to the right which in itself was amazing enough, but the really amazing part was that during the approximately three seconds it&#39;s took to make that turn, the MD-80 we were in (which by the way was traveling about 500 mph at the time) did not speed past this thing. It made this maneuver almost suspended in that position. We saw it commence that maneuver in the same position out the window that we saw it complete it. It was like we had not moved forward at all. I know we did, but can&#39;t imagine why this craft was visible to us for so long in the same position. I suppose perhaps it was larger than it appeared and perhaps farther away which might explain it&#39;s lengthy stay in that position, but I don&#39;t think so. When it was over, we looked at the others in the plane to see if anyone else had seen it and I doubt anyone else was even awake. Nobody said anything about it, so we felt it was best not to mention it then. We didn&#39;t want others to laugh, but the longer we thought about it, the more we wanted to speak up. We did tell our relatives in Ohio when we arrived, but I don&#39;t think they really believed us. I personally have always believed that the universe is too large and deliberately constructed to belong to only us. I have always thought if we were the ultimate in intelligent life, the universe was really in trouble, so UFOs were never out of the question for me. I had never seen one before and may not have now, but I always had an open mind. My wife on the other hand is oriental and is not at all open to science fiction, or anything else like that. She believes now though. I served in the USAF for 8 years during the VietName war and I am now a software quality engineer for a large high tech corporation. My wife works in a semiconductor manufacturing plant as a process technician.<n>

I just think my account deserves to be included.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was a cool evening sometime in May of 2000. I was standing outside my friends house with a few buddies smoking cigarettes.  There was a total of 6 of us outside that night.  Sometime around 2300 in the Eastern sky a bright object appeared which resembled a very large star.  The light seemed to be coming out of the craft at a even and constant rate, so basically it was a ball of light.  Not like any aircraft I have ever seen.  And I have seen a lot, my MOS was 6060 flight equipment tech. Anyway what was really strange was the speed and angles that it was traveling for some strange reason the craft made several(3 or 4) rediculously sharp turns at angles approching or exceeding 90 degrees.  The craft covered a good deal of space considering it was at least 7-10,000 feet in the sky.  The thing I really hate to say is the fact that it sounds like many other UFO sightings I have heard.  Maybe we are not all crazy? Only myself and another friend so the objct.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date may be approximate, although the witness does not indicate that fact.

We watched as this object approached my house.  At this time, it was approximately 200 feet above my house, where it proceeded to hover.  Then, a spotlight shone down from the object onto the house.  The attenuation of the light faded about 3/4 of the way to the house.  At this time, my friend and I, rather frightened by the experience, ran into the house.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

We were returning to San Francisco along I-5, when at some point after passing through Buttonwillow or thereabouts (it could have been even further north than that, but it was a few years ago) I noticed 3 white lights in the sky to my right at about 1000 ft.  I was the driver in my Jeep Wrangler with the top down, so the lights were easy for me to spot.  What was interesting was the position of the lights - they were almost completely vertical. Eventually they became obscured by a tree line and I continued driving for about 5 minutes when I came upon an open field and realized the object was descending.  It just seemed odd and I was curious, so I decided to pull over and try to get a better look at it (much to my friend&#39;s dismay!) As it descended, the 3 lights leveled out and it descended to just a few feet above the ground.  As soon as it was level and was skirting across the field in my direction, one of the 3 lights, the one in the middle, faded out completely as though it had been switched off.  It continued in our direction and it looked as if it would quickly overtake us when suddenly it shot back up in the air, again sideways, the third light came back on, and it seemed to cover quite a bit of distance in a short amount of time heading southeast.  Then, apparently following the same course, it repeated the above...  again it descended in the same field, light went out, came toward us, again it shot upward and sideways, and again headed southeast along the highway.  It did this 3 or 4 times, and then it finally headed southeast and  disappeared fairly quickly.  By this time my friend was freaking out and wanted to get out of there, so we continued on our way.  At first I thought it was a glider of some kind because it made absolutely no noise the entire time.  But I was under the impression that glider pilots generally fly during the day and at higher altitudes, and I don&#39;t think it would hav! e been fast enough to cover as much ground as it did when it gained altitude and headed away from us.  It also didn&#39;t look like any glider I&#39;ve ever seen - it was dark, almost black and it was hard to discern its shape until it was almost right on top of us, and even then if it wasn&#39;t for the position of the lights we may have had a harder time noticing the outline as a sort of flying wing similar to a stealth bomber or something.  By this time my friend was freaking out and wanted to get out of there, so we continued on our way.  I have absolutely no idea what it was, but I always assumed there had to be some logical explanation, like maybe some kind of crop duster, an experimental aircraft, or maybe some crazy guy flying a home-brewed glider in the pitch black of night.  Whatever it was it was wierd.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

It was about 9:30 p.m. We stopped shortly for gas before continuing home. As we pulled out of the gas station to turn, I immediately noticed a large bright object that was nearly directly in front of us in the sky, just across the road from our position. At first I did not notice any particular hard shape to the object -- it appeared to be a formation of hundreds and hundreds of white lights, pulsing, and moving slowly parallel to the road that lay in front of us (approx 45 -55 mph). It was roughly the shape of a cut diamond-- a flat top, angling out to two points, then down to a point at the bottom center. The lights were continuously pulsing -- not being extinguished, but alternately growing bright and then dim. They did not pulse in pattern, but seemed to be random, but quickly and continuously. Other than the white lights, I did notice at least two red lights - one in the center mass of the object, and one, perhaps two, at the bottom edge. This object was quite close; we were within just a couple hundred yards. It was flying over treetop level, so I would estimate it was several hundred feet in the air. The object by my estimate was 50 to 100 feet in length. There was no sound whatsoever. The night was dark but clear. Exasperated by the sight, we quickly turned right to follow the object. As we followed the angles of the road, the object was in front as we trailed to follow. I did not notice a &#34;change&#34; in shape, but perhaps from a different viewpoint, the object then appeared to be somewhat oval in shape, and I picked up a distinct pattern to the lights - the object seemed to be divided into four equal quadrants of white lights, and was &#34;hollow&#34; in its center. That is to say that the quadrants seemed to meet together around a small hole in the middle that had no lights. We continued to follow the object, but its pace began to pick up. At one point, it seemed to stop and hover over the road in front of us for several seconds. It then continued to cross the road to our right, and we turned off to follow. We followed its trail for several minutes, intermittently losing it in the trees and then sighting it again. The last sighting of the object we had, it was moving away at a very high rate of speed; in a few moments, its spectacular lights were indistinguishable from the nights&#39; stars. Traffic on the roads that night was not particularly heavy, but there had to be a dozen or more witnesses. I called local television stations and the Air Force Base just to ask if anyone had reported &#34;something weird&#34; in the sky without relating my own story. No one had. I did hear, from the base&#39;s public affairs, that a commercial blimp had flown in the area earlier on the same day. But with the flight characteristics, it&#39;s shape, the hundreds and hundreds of pulsing lights, I just don&#39;t see that I could mistake a flying balloon for what in my own estimation was an unkown object. I&#39;m an Army veteran and have flown in all sorts of aircraft and helicopters, but I can&#39;t say that I&#39;ve ever seen an object like this, and I haven&#39;t seen one since. But ever since that day, I do spend quite a lot of my time with my eyes toward the sky, hoping that I get to see one again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

All of a sudden one of the &#34;stars&#34; began to slowly move horizontally across the sky. Not as slow as a satallite though. As the star moved across the top of the sky it&#39;s glow grew brighter until the glow was a nice bright but not blinding white with a slight golden hue. As it continued to move across the sky its light then began to dim until it was no longer visible. This all lasted maybe 3 to 5 minutes. The ufo was very high! Also the light was not bliking it was a nice slow turn from dim to bright to to dim to see.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

We both worked at the galleria.  It was kind of an over cast day with sunlight.  The clouds were towards the north east.   We were talking like we usually do when I noticed something in the sky.  I said to my buddy &#34;look up there&#34; and pointed.  I said to him &#34;what the hell is that&#34;.  not in an alarming sense but just curiousity.  I happened to swear a lot at the time.  we botth watched it for about maybe 8 minutes.  then it moved a lot closer and fast. Based on watching  helicopters from the local national guard unit  and also watching airplanes flying to and from the local airport, I had and idea of the relative altitudes those vehicles flew at. and also how long it took to get from one point in the sky to another at their respectful altitudes.   Well  this thing  was flying higher than a helicopter.  but not as high as an airplane.  It was maybe flying at 2 times the height of a typical helicopter flight.  Anyways it covered a distance of maybe 5 to 8 miles in about a second.  Oh before it moved closer it was just sitting there.  anyways,  I said ((deleted)) and my buddy said &#34;damn!&#34;.  we never saw anything move that fast in our lives.  We continued to stare at it.  I started to  make jokes by saying aloud &#34;hey aliens over here!!&#34; :)   Well it was easier to see the object now.  It stood out among the dark clouds when the sun was shining on it.  The way it looked was like highly polished aluminum.  You know like wheels on a car or a polished stainless steel muffler.  Being that it was so visibly define,  I noticed that it appeared to be rotating. not the very top of it just the middle hull.  I think it  was rotating counter clockwise.  Anyways we watched it for about 2 more minutes.  Then i heard the door at the entrance of the mall. We were standing outside one of the interior corridor doors.  Well i looked over to see who was coming out ( just out of natural human curiousity). After i glanced over I immediately returned my focus to where the o! bject ha d been in the sky.  I asked my buddy where it was.  He said that he didn&#39;t know.  He was watching it the whole time even during the time I looked away.  He said that it just dissapeared.  We&#39;ve told some people about it.  Some just laugh at us and think we are silly.  Other people know we wouldn&#39;t lie to them but are still skeptical or just dismiss it.  I would be skeptical about such things myself until I would actually witness such a thing.  And that day I did witness such a thing.  There have been three anomalys in the sky that I have seen in my life.  Two were at night.  one of those i don&#39;t remember.  Another friend of mine told me about it cause he was with me.  It happened about 10 years ago.  When we both seen this light in the sky and it moved irratically.  The other time i seen somthing at night was another light.  This white light was higher than an airplane and it moved from horizon to horizon in about 30 seconds.   The long story I wrote here  was the first time I saw anythiing weird in the daytime.  My father in-law is a truck driver.  he has made a delivery or 2 to the research facilities near the mall.  He only told me of this after i told him what me and my buddy had seen.

It made no sound and as I looked at it, it moved closer to me, toward me.  It appeared to be a boomerang with &#34;eyes&#34; or windows, like a bat.  I became very scared as it moved toward me and could feel that it saw me.  It moved silently and at an angle and was much closer than I first thought.  I ran in the house and immediately looked out the window. It was gone.  No sound. instantly from being stopped in the sky and then coming toward me.  I have only told this to one or two people who did not believe me.  I am an attorney and a natural skeptic.  This was very real.  Right in the middle of LA!  It seemed otherworldly to me.  I felt its energy.  I told myself that &#34;Skunkworks&#34; the testing facility for experimental aircraft in less then 100 miles away in Palmdale, CA, but in my heart....I saw something else.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Very frightening as it was coming toward me.

First of all, the neighborhoud in wich the factory was located in a dense urban area. If a UFO or any other flying craft would have landed in this area, someone else should have noticed too. Secondly, there was a full-scale investigation to determine what the cause of the accident and the results concluded that the containers containing the pyrotechnics, weren&#39;t safe and the person who lit the fire has confessed to the fact that he had lit the fire. I am a resident of the town of Krommenie, wich is locared about an hour driving from Enschede. I read the full accident report, and I visited the site.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I think its a shame that an organisation such as NUFORC is fooled by a prank report and this could have been prevented if your screeners just did a little more background checking of the accident.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Regards,  ((name deleted))<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((END))<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We are grateful to the reader for bringing the information, and our apparent oversight, to our attention.

I am curious if there were any other witnesses or if any of the local airports picked anything questionable up on radar.<n>

This beautiful &#34;thing&#34; was symetrical, large round center with small round shapes surrounding it.  It must have been quite high because it looked like it was traveling at a slow speed and there was no sound.  As it went over the house, I ran through to the front door, snagging my husband at the same time as we both watched it quickly disappear into the eastern sky.<n>

I went over to close her passenger door when she noticed something floating in the night sky. It was gray in color and at first appeared to be an owl or bird of prey with a large wingspan hovering above her house. Upon closer inspection, we both realized that it was not!  As I looked closer I noticed the following: Was boomerang in shape... § It floated about 500-2000 feet in the air § moved slightly faster than a blimp, however, not as fast as a conventional aircraft § was very well camouflaged in the orange-gray night sky § had a wingspan of about 30-60 feet § moved in a North East direction § had an airspeed of less than 50 miles per hour § had what appeared to be very tiny and faint orange lights all over it under carriage § did not change course or speed § had no engine sounds § and, no navigation lights common to conventional aircraft. I quickly scrutinized what we were looking at based on my knowledge as a senior aircraft maintenance technician in the Air Force reserves. It was then that I (and my fiancé) realized what we had seen.  We looked at each other and acknowledged the facts; we had seen a UFO. As to the nature of its origin (military or alien) we could not say with any certainty.  We do however, agree it was an advance technology. It should be noted that we were looking in the sky because there was some police helicopter activity about two miles away. The object we saw appeared to have no concern of the busy night sky and was headed in the opposite direction. The next day, My pager failed to function.  I called the paging company and they sent me a new one.  However, that one did not work and they had to send another, and another. The third pager was an upgaded &#34;diffrent signal&#34; unit and then worked.  However, each page I had including the original, turned on and has a &#34;beep&#34; as if fully functioning.<n>

These preliminary impressions on the part of the witness apparently did not bear out under investigation.<n> <n><n> <n><n> John Kirby and Skip Schultz, State Director, can be reached over the internet, or through NUFORC.))<n> <n><n> <n><n> [This is being written by MUFON investigator, John Kirby, section director, Multnomah County, Oregon] Witness was stopped at a traffic light at the corner of 72nd and Woodstock in Portland.  While waiting for the light to change, there was a brilliant flash &#34;for just a few milliseconds&#34; in front of her vehicle and up about 10 feet in the air (very approximate height).  When the flash occurred, power went out in the area -- the traffic light went off, street lights went off, and lights in a tavern at the intersection went off. Her car continued to operate and so did a car across the intersection (that car turned left just after the incident).  The witness was &#34;temporarily blinded&#34; by the brightness of the flash and said that things looked dark all around (presumably / possibly) by her eyes&#39; reaction to the light. The power came back on in just 1-2 seconds both at the traffic light and at the nearby structures.  Street lamps did not come back on. None of the other drivers (there were at least two other cars nearby) seemed to react unusually (they continued to drive on when the light changed).  Nobody got out of their car to look, etc. Investigator&#39;s opinion: This is consistent with an electrical arc (short circuit, fault) on a power line near / above the intersection.  When this occurred, presumably a circuit breaker opened (cut off the power) to the area.  Usually circuit breakers used in power systems are configured to reset after a few seconds, and if the short circuit is cleared, the power will come back on and stay on.  I have been told by members of the power company that small animals or birds sometime straddle power lines causing a temporary short circuit. The animals are unfortunately killed or seriously injured in the process, and are knocked free of the wires by the explosion.  Therefore the short circuit is &#34;cleared&#34; immediately and the power is restored in a few seconds.  This could also be caused by debris falling on wires and temporarily shorting the line. I did not go out to look at the wires to see if there is an obvious place where short circuits might occur, but I may do that in the coming few days. Note that the reason why the street lights did not come back on immediately is likely due to the fact that lights commonly used by cities, such as mercury vapor lamps, if the power is cut off for even just a moment, will take a few minutes to restart. When this explanation was proposed to the witness, she said that it made sense to her.<n>

It was approx 2500-3500 ft above. I slowed my car down to get a better look, it stayed there for approx 7 seconds.  I looked away, to make sure I wasn&#39;t going to hit anyone with my car. I looked back at the craft, it was speeding away (towards the east) at an excessive speed-I barely got a last glimpse of it!<n>

We had a meeting to go out and do our paperround. As we usually do,we drove on our bikes towards the distribution office, as one of us yelled, kijk naar het water, we did that and we saw a Formation of strange bouncing lights above the IJsselmeer. They moved around in a bouncing pattern, not emmitting any sounds. We stopped and we looked upon them with incredible awe. Then they broke their pattern and made around circle with the opening towards us. Maybe they seen us or something. Than they made an awfull sound. Like a piece of chalk over the schoolbord, and they shot up into the air and they dissapeard. We stood by the water, the surface, normally very calm in no-wind conditions, was very wild and wavy. We quikly drove towards the office.<n>

As far as I can recall it was the size of a stadium and it was just static in the clouds (some what above them).  The orange ball emitted an orange aura and did not move at all.  Every body was sleeping on the plane and I was the only witness to this anomaly.  At the time I thought it was an atmospheric phenomenon, but now after seeing photos of comparable photos with identical objects being labeled as UFO&#39;s, I thought you might be interested in this sighting.  I really regretted not having a camera!  I&#39;m now studying in Poland, so you can call me here or email me if you have any questions.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was a clear night and I had just left the store and  was enjoying the ride back home when I felt like I was being watched. And I noticed some of the street Iights went out and on kinda flickering all up and down the road. I just  kept on peddling, cause if you are black at night and in my  neighborhood, you just don&#39;t stop.  Anyway, I finally got tired of wondering and looked back., and damn if I didn&#39;t just about ((deleted)). There was this huge((deleted)) thing in the sky, black and silent. It was a floating just about 300 feet up or so, and sort of swinging from side to side. No lights, no sound. Just like a big ((deleted)) balloon about 100 feet across. Triagle looking, solid, blacker than me.   I don&#39;t have any notion what that ((deleted)) was.  All I know is I never ever saw anything like it.  I heard about this kinda stuff but I just used to laugh. Well, not now!  I dropped the bike, the beer, started hoofin it down the street. When I got home my wife thought I had a run in with some of the neighborhood ((deleted)), cause I was sweating ((deleted)) when I came in. I just went straight to the shower and sat down. I cried ((deleted)) for  about an hour. Then I pulled myself together, and wrote down as much detail as I could. So I could tell someone.  Here it is. I hope you don&#39;t think I am on crack or something, I ain&#39;t never touched the devil;s chicklets and I never will.  So this is straight up on the one.  It happened.  Stone cold fact. I thank you for you time.((name deleted))<n>

I drove about twenty minutes, wenn I saw very strange &#34;lightings&#34; front of me in the air but not so high.  I dont know why I stopped .<n> <n><n> <n><n> First I thought lot of little helicopter I`ve seen.  Verticalli and horizontali, a shape like a football-field with  lot of little flashing lights, and this lights were flashing not in the same time.

The &#34;object&#34; was moving the direction from Hungary toward Austria.  I was watching the lights and it seemed from the way that was flashing and moving that Iwas seeing something solid-massiv, wide and high not something little aircrafts moving separate near to each other.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have to add to this that was night no other source of lights near to me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Well, since this happened I`m thinking what I`v seen actually?<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Source is anonymous.

Moved in perfect straight line. No sound. no blinking lights. Looked like a star but I could tell it wasnt as far away as the stars but much higher than a helicopter and a commercial jet coming by. I thought maybe it was a satelite! It had no trail or tail. No wings. Just a star sixed glowing light. It crossed from 1030 (just over the little mountain out back) to 230 (over the roof of our house and far enough out to fade into the glow of LA) in about 50 seconds. Way faster than I&#39;ve ever seen a military jet come across especially up high. And it was so quiet. no sonic boom or nothing. Wonder if it showed on local radar? Ontario Airport, Corona Airport and Adams Ave Airport are all nearby. Would appreciate your feedback on this. PS we dont drink or do drugs. Didnt have camera available at the time. my wife saw it too.<n>

It was also much darker than the sky and the few clouds that hung low on the horizon.  We observed it for about 3-5 minutes until it disappeared very quickly.

Husband looked out he window to the north and saw this low flying sphere which looked to be made of glass, at least it was shining like the brightest reflection, and then behind it came another one....when I looked over, I just thought how odd, and wondered what kind of artillery was being used, that we should actually be able to see some type of (??) being propelled horizontally across the sky...at a very fast rate of speed...then all of a sudden they veered upward heading almost towards an imaginary two if on a clock face....and there was a black circle in the bottom of the one my husband viewed, with a heavy yellow jet stream of exhaust coming from it....since I was on the other side of the auto, the UFO&#39;s left my line of vision sooner than they did for my husband, who was craning his neck and looking out of our van, to continued viewing them as they sped out of sight...<n> <n><n> <n><n> all this happened so quickly, we were puzzled as to what we&#39;d seen. but it was in an airspace which was between Lawton and Ft.

There was no sound as it was much higher than that of aircraft traffic even at cruise altitude. It may have been a satalite in orbit.

Very large.  Tiny dim lights around edges.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On the eigth of May, I witnessed a black triangular craft fly over our house three times in the course of about a half an hour.  My father saw it first, and called me outside.  After waiting for a couple of minutes, it showed up again, cruising slowly and silently, directly over the house.  The object was about five hundred feet up, and I could see the structure that the lights were attached to.  There were lights along the two leading edges, and the back was slightly inverted.  I would estimate that the object was about one hundred yards across.  After we lost sight of it, we waited, and it returned within five minutes, this time headed in the opposite direction, as if it had made a turn, and come directly over us once again.  We waited for it show up again, and about ten minutes later we saw it make a turn towards Foothill (Mountains).  We were out there four nights in a row, and it is almost guaranteed to show up.  It usually flys over from about 9:45 to about 10:30 P.M.  We both get the impression that the craft (or whoever may be piloting it) knows when we spot it.  Due to the way it flys directly over the house, it seems to want to make contact of some sort.  Last year around this time of year, the same thing was happening.  It gives me and my father a very eery feeling everytime it flies over.  My father works for the county of Santa Barbara, and I&#39;m a junior at Carpinteria High School, 16 years old.  I myself have never seen any unusual objects in the sky before, such as this.  I also did not really believe in the UFO phenomenon until I saw this.  Needless to say, it is kind of spooky.  We&#39;ll keep you updated if anything else happens.<n>

I was looking to the west-northwest.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I saw a single, bright, amber-colored diamond shaped object in the sky to the west-northwest of Evansville. The object, when it caught my eye, was about the size of my thumbnail at arm&#39;s length. The object immediately seemed to shrink in size until it could not be seen at all. Time to shrink was about 10 seconds. There was no horizontal or vertical movement to the object. It was appx. 30 degrees above the horizon. I have a habit of looking into the night sky as I walk to my front door to see what celestial objects are visible that night. I first thought it to be a planet or very bright star... until it disappeared. It was then I realized that the sky was completely overcast. The object was in the normal flight path for departing aircraft from EVV, but I saw no other lights or beacons or lateral movement that would indicate an aircraft. I have no approximation at all for distance to the object. I watched for a few minutes afterward with no other activity in that area of the sky. It may be nothing, but I thought I should report in case I wasn&#39;t the only one to have seen this object.<n>

Discription would resemble a &#34;Straight Pin&#34; Such as a ball at one end.<n> <n><n> <n><n> While attending what is known as Point to Point at Winterthur I was observing, through binoculars, all events of the day including horses, spectators and the helicopter over head covering the event from the air. While observing and following the helicopter through binoculars I noticed in the distance, beyond the helicopter what appeared to me for a split second to be a comet.  I quickly realized that this was not a comet for it was not moving in a horrizontal or vertical position and it also did not have any of the usual traits of what I know of a comet.  This object was brilliant gold in color. Had a ball shape on the left side followed by a long cone shape tail or body (needle like) that continued to a point on the right. Given the distance observed I would guess the length at around 200-300 ft. Object did not appear to be moving left,right or vertically. I observed this object for at least 00:45 realizing that yes this is a very strange shape, brilliant gold in color and not moving. Without changing direction, shape or color the object then seemed to just vanish by fading into nothing.  The weather was clear, blue skys with an occasional puffy cloud.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  The report is a bit unclear to us.  We do not know if the witness implies a duration of 45 minutes, or 45 seconds.  Also, the sighting is not inconsistent with a contrail, seen in the distance, but that is only conjecture.  We do not know what the individual was witness to.  PD))<n>

The bright white light it emited stayed on for only about 5 seconds and then slowly dimmed till you could no longer see it.

It was about 7:30 PM, and the sky was mostly sunny with few clouds.  As I was driving I saw what first I thought was a plane, so I ducked my head down so as to view it, since it was just out of my sight as I sat in a semi-rigid driving position.  What I observed was a light, pulsating from orange to blue to yellow to pink, which was slowly streaking across the sky from the west to the east at an angle of 270*.  When the object became perpendicular to the interstate it split apart from one object into three separate objects with the same properties in an equilateral triangular pattern.  The three objects then rapidly accelerated and disappeared from my view.  Once I had witnessed this I continued on the interstate until I reached the rest area just north of Onawa at which I pulled off to see if anyone else had seen what had happened since it occurred less than five minutes beforehand.  When I got out of my car, other people were standing on the sidewalk and from what I overheard it sounded like they were talking about what I had seen.  I walked by them without asking them though since I didn&#39;t want to sound crazy, because I wouldn&#39;t want someone walking up to me at a rest stop talking about a UFO.  I am a Cadet of the United States Army, and have taken college astronomy courses so I know what I saw was not Mercury, a &#34;shooting star&#34;, Venus, or any other astronomical body.  What I saw reflected light and emitted light that changed colors, and although the sun was starting to set it was still light enough out that the stars would not be visible, nor was the sun a hindrance since I wasn&#39;t looking into the western sky.<n>

Once it got very close and made another right bank, we could see the underside through our window at the 1 o&#39;clock position. We then could see it was a very large triangle. It was huge. What struck us as odd, was how it was just sitting there, and moved so slow in it&#39;s bank but was so large. It had four white lights one on each point and one in the middle, it had two smaller lights one red and one white on each side of the middle white light. Was also is odd it is passed very close to our building, and we didn&#39;t hear a rumble or anything. (Later a plane passed overhead and we could hear it clearly) Something of that size should have made a large rumble, especially banking as much as it was. It banked pass the window and leveled, and flew off in a southeast direction.<n>

My daughter called me out to the front yard to look at something in the sky. I was on the PC, and a little slow to come out until my wife said &#34;Oh my God, come out and look at this. I don&#39;t believe it.&#34; I went outside and walked into the front yard. There, West SW from my house, about 40 degrees above the horizon, was what looked like a fat pulsating star. It was changing brilliant colors. Magenta, Aqua, Turquoise, Green, Gold, unlike primary colors. It changed color rapidly, but pulsed at a slower frequency. It was quite obvious even with the naked eye that it was pulsating and changing colors. You could see the diameter of it. It reminded me of what Jupiter might look like at times. At arms length, about 1/8 inch diameter. Round and pulsating. It appeared to be much too fat for a star, but otherwise you could not tell size, distance was uncertain. It did not appear to be in space, it was in the sky. It was very weird to be able to watch it for so long. It appeared to remain in the same part of the sky, until we lost it in the glare of the highway lights while chasing towards it in a car. A friend who was visiting happened to have a nice SONY Handycam with Night Shot infrared and 72x digital zoom. We got some great footage of it, first without the infrared. It is not like anything I am aware of that is normal in the sky. We got a good 10 or 20 minutes of it. Then we chased it in the car, but it was obviously a few miles away at least. But the best part was when we switched it to Night Shot Infrared. The object was too far away too be painted by the camera. What we shot was the infrared signature of the object, mixed with monochrome, and it really is spectacular. It looks like a pulsing fog, with a bright triangular nucleus that is spinning rapidly. Like a cell made of light with a spinning triangle for a nucleus. I will get the video uploaded to the internet and post it. Stills are up now at http://www((URL deleted)).html/ I made sure to get perspective shots of the trees and streetlights in the foreground. I am excited to have the video evidence, and curious as to what others might think it is after seeing it.<n>

I heard, what I thought, was a small plane over me.  I looked up.  It was a V or boomerang shaped craft.  It was not a triangle.  Take a V and spread it apart. I stood gazing up as it flew at low altitude, directly over me and down the path that I was walking.  It seemed to be a bit smaller than a 747, yet it sounded more like a small plane.  It was going slow enough, so that I was able to study it and remember what it looked like. It was dull silver metal, like an ordinary plane.  There were no markings whatsoever.  It was perfectly smooth with no projections such as a tail, or point or anything at all.  There were no propellers.  There was a single white flashing light at the end of each wing span.  There were two small yellow objects more toward the center.  Maybe they were additional lights, but they were not on. In the past week, I have scoured the Internet and books, and have not been able to locate this craft.  It is not a Stealth.  It almost looked like a Northrop YB-49, but no propellers and very smooth. I have no memory of watching it fly away or what happened to it.  I studied it intensely as it flew directly over me. Fallbrook California is situated between Camp Pendleton and Miramar.  There seemed to be more than usual helicopter activity in the area for the next few days. My background: father in the military. Grew up partly overseas and military bases.

It was around noon.  We tied up to a tree in a bend of the river.  From where I was sitting I was able to see down the river to the next bend.  We were in the shade of a tree.  I heard a buzzing noise and asked my sister did she hear it.  She had gotten hung and was trying to get it unhung.  I thought we had gotten close to a wasp nest and started looking around.  I looked up across the river just barely above tree top level and saw about 9-10 diamond shaped black shiny things in a diamond formation.  They looked as though they were rocking back and forth but not all together.  All I heard was a loud whoosh as they flew by and after they went out of sight I asked my sister did she see that, but she was still trying to get unhung.  The really weird thing about it was, I forgot about it until the next day.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date and time are approximate.  PD))<n>

It seemed to move in an arch like manner very fast yet fluid in motion. It flew around the neighborhood houses and tree line for several minutes.  Then right before it disapeared it flew through my legs. As it flew between my legs I got a glimpse of of an intense light inside it.

5/3/00 22:30|Surprise (witnessed from)|AZ|Unknown|45 minutes|I was the first to see the unidentified object at approximately 22:00 hours PM.  The "object" flickered brightly in four distinct color|5/11/00|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/012/S12784.html|170|ndxe200005| ((NUFORC Note:  Report is not inconsistent with a &#34;twinkling&#34; star.  Please see addendum below. PD))<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was the first to see the unidentified object at approximately 22:00 hours PM.  The &#34;object&#34; flickered brightly in four distinct colors.  Red, blue, green and white. It moved at what had to be a high rate of speed left and right, stopping quickly at times and changing directions.  When I observed a jet liner heading for it I noticed it faded in brightness and remained still then resumed its right and left movement as soon as the aircraft cleared.  It finally lowered so that we lost sight of the &#34;object&#34;at approximately 23:00 PM<n> <n><n> <n><n> Object, at first appeared to be an overly bright star.  The abrupt right and left movements said differently.  It was located in the lower northwest sky of my home, in the direction of Lake Pleasant, but further out.  The object had flickering lights of red, blue, green and white and looked as if it was rotating to show the different colors as they would be bright then fade and the other color would take its place. When I saw it head one direction then stop and head back as if in a straight line to it&#39;s starting point and repeat the movement in the other direction  &lt;----x----&gt; I was very sceptable, but curious. Sometimes it would move in one direction in short bursts then reversed and do the long movement. From my perspective it was moving approximately three inches in one direction then reversing to go back to it&#39;s original spot.  The short burst were about one inch in length and it was either three burst or two at a time.  I am not sure how that would calculate in miles.  The distance is too great to even estimate for me. I called my daughter out to confirm.  She said she was seeing the same thing.  She called her boyfriend out and he also saw what we were seeing.  We watched this strange occurance for about 45 minutes, using other stars and hand held object to determine if it was a star or something else.  The hand held object were stationary and the &#34;object&#34; was mobile.  It kept the same distance from the reference star until it slowly lowered and disappeared from our sight, the reference star(Cappella) remained where it was. This is my third sighting in 53 years.  At age 9 I witnessed a group of 5 lights dancing (moving up and down and sideways and going brighter and fading) on the horizon while I lived in Tucson, AZ. Tucson has no street lights in 1956. There were about 100 people, police and military included, who witnessed the event. My Dad a military man was told not to say anything.  That was in the days of &#34;Project Bluebook&#34;. In 1976 I saw a strange object in the sky near Redlands, CA.  My date and I watched it &#34;hover&#34; for about 15 minutes then shoot off at a 45 degree angle and disappear.  The newspaper report that several people in that area witnessed the same thing. When I checked the sky on the night of May 4, 2000 It did not see anything unusual as I had the night before. Our reference star was, however, present.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ADDENDUM TO REPORT (Submitted 05MY00):<n> <n><n> <n><n> I would like to change my report given to you last night.  Details below<n> <n><n> <n><n> After summiting my report I again found myself in my backyard, but at a later time.  When I looked where I had seen the &#34;object&#34; the night before I again witnessed the &#34;light&#34; doing the same movements with the same color changes. (Red, blue, green and white) I now feel that it is a star and as the earth rotates changing the placment of the stars this particular one is in an area that distorts it due to something in our atmosphere. (i.e. smog or heat waves)  I can find no other explanation for it being the only &#34;star&#34; in the sky to have such abrupt and unusual movements. I am sorry to have wasted your time.<n>

It would change colors from white to green to blue and red as it moved in the sky. We observed this object using reference stars and other stationary objects to verify that it was actually moving until it finally moved out of our veiw leaving the reference star in the same place.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is the first sighting of an unidentified flying object. The object was brought to my attention by my mother , who first spotted it. It was 22:00 on the night of May 3, 2000 and the skies were clear. I began to watch the object move at a fast pace from east to west and then return to its original spot. We used many different reference stars along with stationary objects in our possesion. The colors changed at random. The object stayed at the same altitude until about 22:45. We then noticed it moving out of our sight. I called the local Air Force Base and they stated that they were not flying and that they would send someone out to look at it. I also called a local news station to see if anyone else had reported anything similar. I am a professional in the medical field and a mother of 4. I have never seen anything like this before. I am fasinated with the star and spend a lot of time looking at them and this was not a normal star. If this is a star it will be the first moving star that can change colors.<n>

Second witness saw object slightly before it stopped, and then noticed a shape change to wide dove like inverted wing very bright blue and moving at hight speed toward north west and it appeared to be approximately 2000 to a possible 3500 ft. above groung level heading downward, then it slowed rapidly and vanished.  Both witnesses agree that the object changed shape and had no trail or tail.  No noise was heard and the speed change and color was similar by both witnesses.  The car windows were closed so if there was any sound it may have not been heard anyway.  This took place on the return trip from Atlantic City casinos.

I cannot remember the exact date...it must have been in April or May of 2000. After it was over my date and I were driving to Rapid City from Pine Ridge (not sure of exact road) to spend the night there. On our drive, some time after 11:00pm, she and I were driving along before you get to Red Shirt when we noticed a strange light in the sky on her side of the car about a mile (not too sure, it was hard to tell). We could tell that it was definitely abnormal because it was some sort of flying object but it was way to low to be a plane or anything else in the middle of nowhere SD. Then all of a sudden, almost instantly the object was about a few hundred feet from us on her side still, probaly 50-70 feet off the ground moving parallel with us. It stayed right along with us for maybe 30 seconds, not long, before it just shot off as fast as it had pulled up. Then, a moment later it re-appeared again, this time on my side of the car about the same distance away and high. It paced with us again for about another 30 seconds and as we approached about a few miles from Red Shirt the object shot off again. We pulled into Red Shirt and drove around the small housing area just to gather our thoughts because while all of this happening, the most typical of things occured.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I know it sounds lame to say, but while the object was in our sight, like within a few hundred feet, all of the electric functions in my car began to go crazy. My headlights turned off and on, as did the hazard lights, the stereo, dashboard lights, I mean everything. We even had this junky car phone, which was cool at the time, now it is a piece of junk, but even it started making beeping and ringing all kinds of sounds. It wasn&#39;t until I realized that I couldn&#39;t control what was going on that I instantly thought what to do if the car shuts down. That was the first moment I remember when a bit of panic set in. At first, I was completely in awe. I remember being almost completely fascinated with what we were looking at but it wasn&#39;t until the electronics started going awry that I realized that my date had completely tried almost to hunch down into her foot area of the passenger seat. Then I kind of snapped out of the &#34;awe&#34; and started to feel panic. I remember trying to speed up but that didn&#39;t do anything but mainly I remember just thinking to myself to not let the car stop. It was truly the strangest thing i&#39;ve ever experienced.<n> <n><n> <n><n> To be completely honest, even though it was only about 6 years ago, I really don&#39;t remember that many details as I think about it. I remember the lights were different colors, but none were distinct, like they weren&#39;t like christmas lights where there is blue, a green, a red. These were more like yellows and reds I think and I remember they were all in what seemed like the outside ring of the object, not on top or below. And I don&#39;t really remember what shape the object was, it was really dark on the road. I just remember being really awestruck, almost excited, and then overtaken by a bit of panic and it was over.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I remember we tried telling people right after that but nobody thought much of it. I told a few close friends but I, just like them, really wouldn&#39;t think much of it unless I saw it for myself. This honestly happened, and I have no problem talking about it to anyone but, either people don&#39;t care or probaly don&#39;t believe me. I tried to bring it up only one time with the girl who was with me that night since then but I could tell that she really didn&#39;t want to talk about it so I guess we&#39;ll just leave it at that.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I told my grandfather a few years ago who lived in outside of Pine Ridge for many years and he said that he would sit outside at nights and watch all sorts of flying objects fly similar routes. He never say anything like what I saw or anything as close but he thought it was just some sort of test or practice flying that pilots from Ellsworth were doing at night and what I saw was probaly just something that Ellsworth was testing, not aliens or that type of UFO&#39;s.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

The object was visible at about 45 degrees in the NE sky. It moved silently at a uniform speed with no change in intensity.  As it reached the 90 degree point I noticed there were actually 3 objects or one large object forming an isosceles triangle.  The object(s)slowly faded out in the SE sky at about 45 degrees above the horizon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Myself and my friend went outside at 10:50 pm to walk the dogs.  I always look at the stars, I am an amateur astronomer and have had a keen interest in that subject for some time. As I looked to the Norheast, I saw what I believed to be a satellite moving to the Southeast.  I pointed this out to my companion.  As the object past over head at 90 degrees I saw there were actually three objects flying in formation, or one large object.  The person with me was able to see two of the three points of light before they faded in the Southeast. The space between the triangle points was very large.  I estimate you could place 3 full moons within that area.  Movement of the object(s) was very fluid, no sound, the points of light making up the triangle remained fixed, not increasing or decreasing in distance.  I observed no stars being blacked out as the object(s)passed over.  Distance above the earth was very difficuly to determine other than to say they appeared to be in low earth orbit.<n>

It was still clear daylight. A bright, glowing (imagine molten steel as a comparison) clearly defined egg shaped object came down vertically, very fast. At about tree level, it disappeared. It made no sound, and left no trail. The entire sequence lasted about 3 seconds.<n>

I saw the main page, and at the bottom it says a blue fireball was seen on the east coast. I just wanted to add, that it looked exactly like that thing that is drawn on the picture someone provided. Creepy<n>

It appeared to be exploding like a giant firework but with much more brilliant colors.I HAVE VIDEO FOOTAGE !!<n>
5/1/00 04:00|Marietta|GA|Oval|unknown|I NOTICED A LARGE OBJECT IN THE SKY IN THE SHAPE OF AN OVAL.|6/21/00|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/013/S13038.html|187|ndxe200005| I NOTICED A LARGE OBJECT IN THE SKY IN THE SHAPE OF AN OVAL.<n> <n><n> <n><n> MY STORY I AM A WOMAN OF FMTH. MY HUSBAND AND I HAVE MINISTERED IN CHURCHES FOR THIRTY (30) YEARS. WHAT I AM ABOUT TO TELL YOU IS TRUE. EVEN THOUGH IT MAY BE HIGHLY UNUSUAL TO THOSE WHO PRACTICE FAITH IN GOD AND A CHRISTIAN LIFE STYLE, IT HAPPENED TO ME. I SAW WHATI SAW MY HUSBAND AND I LIVE IN A LOG HOME ON TWO ACRES OF WOODED LAND THAT BORDERS ONE SIDE OF ATWO ACRE LAKE. ON SUNDAY NIGHT APRIL 30,2000, WE ARRIVED HOME FROM CHURCH AND A CHOIR SOCIAL ABOUT 9:30 PM. WE PREPARED FOR BED AND WATCHED SOME NEWS BEFORE RETIRING FOR THE EVENING. OUR USUAL TIME FOR BED IS ABOUT 11:00PM. SLEEP CAME QUCKLY BECAUSE OF THE EXHAUSTIVE DAY AT CHURCH. AT 2:59 AM, MONDAY, MAY 1,1 LOOKED AT THE. CLOCK AS I RETURNED FROM A TRIP TO THE BATHROOM. IMMEDIATELY, I WAS ASLEEP AGAIN. I AM NOT SURE OF THE TIME THAT I AWOKE THE SECOND TIME. BUT, WHAT I SAW OCCURRED WHEN IT WAS STILL DARK. DAYLIGHT BEGINS TO ARRIVE AROUND 6:00AM EDT AT THIS TIME OF YEAR. I ESTIMATE THE TIME HAD TO BE SOMEWHERE BETWEEN 3 AND 5AM. ABOVE OUR BED IS A SKYLIGHT THAT WE ENJOY ON A CLEAR NIGHT AS WE OBSERVE THE STARS AND MOON OF GOD&#39;S BEAUTIFUL HANDIWORK. ON THIS NIGHT, IT WAS NOT THE STARS AND THE MOON THAT CLAIMED MY ATTENTION. WHEN I AWOKE THIS SECOND TIME, I NOTICED A LARGE OBJECT IN THE SKY ABOVE THE SKYLIGHT. IT WAS MORE OVAL IN APPEARANCE THAN ROUND. IT WAS TURNED UP ON ITS SIDE IN A VERTICAL POSITION WHERE I COULD SEE THE TOP PORTION OF THE. OBJECT FROM A SIDE VIEW. THERE WERE THREE (3) WINDOWS VISIBLE ON THE SIDE OF THE TOP PORTION AS IT WAS TURNED IN THS VERTICAL POSITION. THE WINDOWS WERE TRIANGULAR IN SHAPE AND FILLED WITH LIGHT. WHEN I OBSERVED THE OBJECT, IT WAS MOVING TOWARD THE EARTH. AS I WATCHED TFIROUGH THE SKYLIGHT, THE OBJECT MOVED DIRECTLY TOWARD THE SKYLIGHT. IT MOVED AT A STEADY RATE OF SPEED MAKING A SOFT SWISHING SOUND. THE SWISHING SOUND SEEMED TO BE ASSOCIATED WITH THE CLOCKWISE MOTION OF THE EXTERNAL PART OF THE OBJECT. WHEN THE OBJECT WAS NEAR THE SKYLIGHT, THE CLOCKWISE MOTION STOPPED AND THE OBJCT STOOD STILL, BUT CONTINUED TO MAKE THE SOFT SWISHING SOUND. AS IT MOVED AWAY FROM THE SKYLIGHT, THERE WAS NO VISIBLE MOTION OF ANY PART OF THE OBJECT, THE SOFT SOUND CONTINUED. AS THE OBJECT MOVED ACROSS THE SPACE OF THE SKYLIGHT, I OBSERVED THE BOTTOM OF THE OBJECT. THERE WERE A SERIES OF LIGHTS EMBEDDED IN THE BOTTOM OF THE OBJECT. THESE LIGHTS WERE WHITE AND RED. THE FINISH ON THIS SIDE OF THE OBJECT WAS A GREY METALLIC FINISH. THE OBJECT WAS SO CLOSE AND THE LIGHT WAS SO BRIGHT THAT I COULD SEE THE DETAIL OF THE SURFACE. THE NIGHT WAS AS BRIGHT AS DAY AS THE OBJECT STOOD STILL OVER THE HOUSE. THE OBJECT STOPPED MOTION BRIEFLY AND THEN PROCEEDED MOVING PAST THE SKYLIGHT. AS IT MOVED, IT CONTINIJED TO MAKE THE SWISHING SOUND AND THE DARKNESS REAPPEARED. USUALLY MY FIRST RESPONSE WOULD BE TO AWAKE MY HUSBAND. BUT, I WAS SO CAUGHT UP IN WHAT I WAS SEEING THAT THE OBJECT WAS MOVING AWAY BEFORE I COULD THINK CLEARLY ENOUGH TO TAKE ACTION. SO, I JUST LET IT GO. I WAS SO STRICKEN WITH SUCH AWE, THAT I COULD NOT MOVE. I WOULD HAVE JUMPED UP AND LOOKED OUT THE WINDOW AS IT MOVED AWAY, BUT FEAR LEFT ME MOTIONLESS. MY WHOLE BODY WAS MOTIONLESS.  I DID NOT LOOK AT THE CLOCK WHICH IS HIGHLY UNUSUAL. I ALWAYS CHECK THE CLOCK WHEN I WAKE UP DURING THE NIGHT. BUT, I JUST LAY THERE IN THE DARK STARING INTO THE NIGHT UNABLE TO MOVE A MUSCLE. AS SOON AS MY HUSBAND AWOKE, ABOUT 6AM, I TOLD HIM I HAD SOMETHING TO TELL HIM BEFORE HE WENT TO HIS STUDY TO BEGIN HIS DAY. HE IS SORRY HE MISSED SEEING WHAT I SAW. THIS IS MY STORY. I KNOW I SAW WHAT I SAW. YES, I WAS AWAKE THEN AND A LONG TIME AFTER THE INCIDENT.
