11/28/92 22:30|Los Angeles|CA|Other|4.5 hrs|Bright white football shaped object, turned neon green and shot off horizontally  500 Lights On Object0: Yes|3/19/09|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/068/S68323.html|1|ndxe199211| Bright white football shaped object, turned neon green and shot off horizontally<n> <n><n> <n><n> While attending a family Thanksgiving in Los Angeles, CA, our family had booked several rooms at the Four Seasons Hotel on Doheny Blvd, near Beverly Hills. Our room was on the 5th floor. Since our room was in the middle of the hotel it became the meeting place for everyone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The first morning we were there, which was November 26 at about 9 am the room began to shake ever so slightly. We turned on the TV to find that there was a 5.4 earthquake.  We were delighted to have a great story to tell when we got home back to Texas. What happened next, paled in comparison to the earthquake.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The last night we were there, Saturday November 28, 1992, we ate out and those of us staying at the hotel came back to pack for Sunday’s departure back to our respective homes across the country.  My husband and children went to sleep around 9:30.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My two nephews who had other rooms at the same hotel, came to our room to visit.  The room was sort of a one bedroom suite with a separate living area that had a balcony. We went to the balcony at 10:30, I remember because I checked the time and checked on my family who were all asleep.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was on the balcony with my two nephews ( aged 24 and 26) we could see the layout of the area below which was like a courtyard where people were sitting at tables and walking around. We chatted and enjoyed people watching as well.<n> <n><n> <n><n> All of a sudden, as if someone on the roof had thrown it, I saw what appeared to be a football shaped object bright white light come down in an arc (it did not fall straight down, it arched from the roof to in front of us) to eye level where it seemed to hover in front of us. I happened to be looking up at the sky or roof when it first appeared so I saw it from the get go.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I remember one nephew saying, &#34;What is that?&#34;  The light or whatever it was hovered in front of us for what seemed to be a few seconds then took off like a bullet horizontally and as it did so, it changed color from bright white light to a neon green, with the green advancing from the front to the rear of the object as it changed color, it disappeared into the darkness.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Suddenly, we realized it was 3:00 AM, we were sort of surprised that the time flew by, they left to their rooms and we all went right to sleep.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The next morning, we gathered our things said our goodbyes and headed to the airport. While on the plane to Dallas, I suddenly remembered and told my husband, &#34;We saw a UFO or something.&#34;  He was quite amazed and had me tell him the whole story.  He found it significant that neither of the nephews had mentioned it, and I had not remembered it when we were all together that morning.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My eyes started bothering me beginning that day on the plane ride home. I was seeing spots in front of my eyes like you see after flash photography. I assumed it would go away. By Monday, I was trying to get in touch with my nephews to see what or if they were experiencing something. The younger of the two told his mother who told me that in the night of the sighting, he had a bad nightmare that something had him tied down to a table and was trying to hurt him  By Thursday of the same week, my eyes were somewhat better, but the spots were still there. So, I went to the eye Dr. He checked and said that I had damage similar to an arc welders burn at the back part of the inside of my eye. He asked if I had been near anyone while they were welding. I told him no, not at all. He said the spots would go away in a few more days and they eventually did.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I was finally able to speak to my nephews about our experience, neither really wanted to discuss it other than to say it was the strangest thing they’d ever seen.  Neither of them could understand why it was 10:30 then 3:00 and why time flew by, furthermore none of us could understand why we all seemed to forget about it completely until I remembered. The nephew that had the nighmare said he didn’t want to talk about it, so I dropped it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Page 2 UFO Experience cont’d.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I became obsessed with this experience.  Since the Internet was not available at the time, I went to the Dallas Public Library. I asked the Librarian how to report a UFO. She turned to a reference book, and gave me two names.  The first of which was in Phoenix, AZ. To this day, I cannot remember the man’s name. I called him and he took down the incident.  He may have had me make a drawing and mail it or fax it to him.<n> <n><n> <n><n> He had the oddest monotone voice, very deep but without emotion or inflection.  He assured me he would look into it.  A few weeks later, he called me and told me that he went to the Four Seasons, he actually stayed in our room (back then I knew the room number and gave it to him-now I can only remember 5th floor) he said that in daylight, the direction at which the bright white object that turned green went on the horizontal level would have taken it into a shopping mall on Robertson Blvd. He said that was not logical.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Furthermore, he said that green lights are a phenomenon that occurs around earthquakes and have nothing to do with UFO’s.   His conclusion was that what we saw were those lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Obviously, I forgot this man’s name because he did not tell me what I wanted to hear.  He did not validate what we knew we saw, a UFO.  We knew it was a UFO and have known all this time. He had no explanation as to why the object changed color from white to green as it went horizontal and shot off faster than I can type it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We know what we saw was a UFO.  We were not UFO buffs at the time.  This thing or even seeing it was the farthest thing from our minds.  What I do know is this thing to me was real. It was an experience I will never forget, and it opened my mind to the fact that we are not alone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As a sidebar to this experience, when I took the film from our California trip to be developed the girl that was working at the photo shop asked me who was my trip.  Well, I told her all about the UFO. She told me that on her way to work a week earlier she saw a diamond shaped UFO which seemed to follow her from Plano, Texas, (along FM 544) to Carrollton, Texas, which is where the photo processing store was. Not just her, but suddenly I found out I knew other people who had seen UFO’s right here in our area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact me.<n>

I was driving south on 270 to a friend’s house and was passing by Port Columbus Airport, when I saw on my right what at first I thought was a helicopter (being so near the airport it seemed logical). It was around the size of a helicopter but had no tail or rotors, etc. I kept looking at it because it didn’t move and was a shadowy disk shape with white lights around the edge. I then thought it was only a plane coming in to land, but it just sat in the sky. I kept driving.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then I noticed an identical UFO about 50 feet directly above a box car of a train on the Columbus &amp; Ohio River Railroad bridge that goes right past the airport. The UFO was shining a large white light down from the center of the underside of the disk onto one of the box cars, as though it were inspecting it. The light was very wide, taking up the middle part of the underside of the UFO—maybe it was at least a 7-10ft. wide searchlight. It was illuminating an entire box car and part of another.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I then noticed a third identical-looking UFO to my left in a grassy area right before the bridge. It was almost touching the ground, and it shown a bright white searchlight on the ground, too. (My truck was noisy, but I could not hear any noise from the UFOs). I passed under the railroad bridge, directly under the one UFO above it. I became excited and exited at Broad St. instead of Main St., which is where I was originally headed. As I was about to make a U-turn to get back onto 270, I saw yet a fourth identical UFO directly in front of me, but higher in the sky and further away, possibly 500 feet away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I made the U-turn and got back onto 270 and continued to Main St. I didn&#39;t try and go back the other way on 270 to take another look, because I would be late to an appointment. There were many cars on the freeway, so there had to be others who saw the UFOs.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))<n>

I pulled over and got out of the car.  I looked up and saw a bright light, bright for a couple minutes, there were these strange &#34;mist&#34; rings that were below the light itself, concentric rings with a space between them,  about three in all.  Dude, it was fantastic.  Then the light suddenly diminished in size, took an angled turn and disappeared up into the sky..<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Size 2&#34; X 2.5&#34; 2. Weight Approx. 2 ounces 3. Color: Brownish 4. Appears to be metallic 5. It can be scratched with a metallic tool but nevertheless appears quite hard 6. It is not attracted to nor does it repel a magnet 7. When accidentally dropped onto a hard wood floor from waist height it did not fracture 8. There is a concavity in the object which makes it resemble a miniature ash tray Clearly though it is not that.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 9. Conccavity has a shape that somewhat resembles a leaf of sorts, or possibly a ping pong paddle with a very short handle.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 10.Around the periphery of the leaf and bordering it is a beading that appears as a thin line 11.The object appears to have endured great heat and pressure. It is blackned and charred on its under surface and the blackness does not rub off.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object appears also to be distorted. Appears that extreme heat and pressure resulted in object beginning to melt and then to re-solidify into a distorted shape and losing some of its symmetry.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 12.There appears to be symbols inscribed on the periphery of the object. A coup couple - two or three- seem somewhat discernible, while others appear either        obliterated or severely marred by the heat and stress.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 13.I tried to photograph a drawing that I had made of the symbols and transfer them onto my computer. My camera was not working properly, so I was not able to do this. If you prefer, I can fax the drawing over to you.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I hope that I have covered all bases on this issue. To me the object does not seem to be of this world. It does not appear to be of Native American origin. It was discovered a few miles north of the crash site along, I am told, with many other physical artifacts that someone claims were diagnosed as being of meteorite origin.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It is quite obvious that my object was made by a being or beings with intelligence, whether they be human or extraterrestrial. At the &#34;tip&#34; of the concavity is a small hole about 2mm deep and 1 to 1.5 mm in diameter. It is horizontal and just below the lip of the concavity and in the midline. The hole is too perfectly round and too perfectly positioned to be an accident. Perhaps it is the female part of a attachment that would lock something into the concavity. My own unprofessional opinion is that the object may be a medallion or some csort of decorative element. Please respond.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness sends a photograph of the object, but we don&#39;t know what it is.  It could be a piece of slag, but that is only a guess.  Until the object is analyzed by a laboratory, its nature will remain an unknown.  PD))<n>

I was located inisde the Fort Hamilton Army Base in Brooklyn, NY. We observed the shower, just over the horizon, through the center and upper level of the Verrazzano Bridge. It was an amazing sight. But when we looked directly overhead, we saw about twelve unknown craft, all bottom-lit and flying in what I could only describe as a group of pool balls in a triangle formation, moving at a high rate of speed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> These craft were definitely over the &#34;ceiling&#34; and were moving much faster than a passnger jet would fly at the same altitude. The most amazing thing about this sighting was that the UFO&#39;s switched positions rapidly, in like an &#34;X&#34; fashion, just as they were flying over my head. all of them did it at the same time, quite rapidly and precisely - it was then that I knew that the only group capable of doing such aerial arobics at that speed would be the Blue Angels.<n> <n><n> <n><n> But why would they be flying over the city on an average day and at night - and in such a formation? And why were the fighters bottom-lit? Alot about this encounter did not make any sense to me. My natural assumption is that the craft must have been extra-terrestrial. I&#39;m just hoping that I wasn&#39;t the only one, aside my cousin, who had my eye on the sky that night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  We have assigned an artificial date, allowing for the possibility that the witnesses may have been looking at the Leonid (??) Meteor shower, which we believe is the shower that occurs annually in mid-November.  PD))<n>

Object was first spotted when driving and was about 200ft in the air and 3/4 mile away.  After reaching our destination we observed the object as it approched from about 1/2 mile away.  The leading tip of the object had a white light on the underside while the 2 rear tips had red lights.  Before the object got 1/4 mile from us my brother got scared and ran inside to hide leaving my mother and me to witness the rest.  As it approched we saw an orange/white light in the center not as bright as the other 3.  As it passed directly overhead we could see lots of machanical &#39;busy-ness&#39; underneath kind of like piping or electrical work however not in any traditional sense.  A very low hum could be heard almost below frequencies that can be detected by human ears.  We continued to watch until the object flew out of view behind a building.  The whole sighting lasted about 15 minutes the first 3 of which were while we were in the car.  The object remained at the same altitude and maintained constant velocity throughout the sighting.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I said yes they were quite a bit smaller than that.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They told me someone from the Peoria, IL office would be calling me too.  But they never did.

I slowed my car to almost a stop and continued looking at it.  It was not only what I saw but how it made me feel.  I knew that it was not a plane or any frying object I had ever seen before.  It just hovered above for about 45 seconds and about the time I went to say something to the passenger in my car I looked back and it was gone.  I never believed in UFO,s but the one thing I do know is that the feeling it left me with I still feel when I think about that day.  I have since started researching on UFO&#39;s and what other people have experienced.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have not told this to many people because like me before the experience I would think myself weird so I know that is the way others will look at me as.<n>

It came in at an incredible speed and slowed almost to a halt approximatly 100 feet over our heads then performed a semi-circular maneuever.  It continued at a slow speed and then we saw the reason for the maneuver.  It had gotten in front of a rectangular craft that was matte black, approx 75 ft long, 40 ft high and approx 40 ft wide.  In the front of the craft there was a small square window with light inside and another one on the side of the craft about the same size.  The under-side of the craft had everything molded inside except for what appeared to be four thrusters on each corner of the craft.  The first craft that performed the maneuver was a round sphere and was lit inside enough to make out a lattice-work frame, but could not make out anything else.  We watched the two craft for about 2 minutes and we noticed 2 more of the spheres coming from the north as the others had.  These two were identical the first sphere and like the first were coming in at an incredible speed but when they came in behind the rectangular craft, instantly matched its speed which was probably less than 20 MPH.  All of this was done without creating one single sound.  We could hear cattle bawling of in the distance and even birds rustling in the brush, but nothing from the four craft.  My background at the time was in electronics and my son&#39;s was in law enforcement.  I have worked on some very sophisticated integrated weapons systems, but this was beyond anything I had ever heard of before.  Whomever they were and whatever they were; one thing is for sure; they were the masters of gravity.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Quickly realized there was a dark silhouette and rectangular craft, the size of a football field traveling slowly from left to right.  No sound at all!  Altitude had to be at least 20,000 feet high.  It had a slow pulsating red light in the bottom-center of craft.  It was traveling towards CT River/East Hartford.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I remember there used to be a Marines barrack not too far near Brainard Airport.  It&#39;s no longer there.<n>
