When it was mixed with the stars;it stopped, blinked it&#39;s lights and moved slowly south out of the valley.<n>

Object darted accross the sky and finally hovered about 100 feet from my house.  Was extremely quite and had red lights that circled its middle.  After a few minutes the object took off very fast going to the NW.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On February, 1986 I was looking toward the South at the ocean.  We have a great view of Santa Cruz all the way to Monterey.  I noticed a small round object in the sky coming from the South.  It caught my attention because of the strange way it was darting from one side of my view to the other.  Their was a band of red lights circling the middle part of the saucer shaped object.  So I watched for a few minutes as it neared my house.  I expected that when it got nearer that I would hear a sound from the engine, believing at the time that it was a plane or helicopter. This strange object stopped just 100 feet short of my house and hovered there quietely.  At this point my sister came to see what I was yelling about.  She also saw this strange object and wondered what it was.  I quickly ran inside to get my telescope to get a clearer picture of what I was seeing.  AS I was struggling to get the tripod out the back door the object took off very fast making a beeline for the North West. I tried to follow it with my eyes running around the side of the house but it disappeared very quickly. The things that stood out: moved very fast, was very quite, and was in the shape of a round saucer with red lights.  The zig zag pattern was very interesting to watch and it did not do that when it darted away.  The saucers color was dark with red lights. My sister and I still talk about what we saw at dusk that evening.<n>

Year 1986 Feb 9th.|3/9/04|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/035/S35392.html|9|ndxe198602| Sharp turning flying object with orange light in Malaysia. Year 1986 Feb 9th.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have been keeping this sighting story in my mind for so many years and it is glad to share with everyone here. That was in year 1986 during the well-known comet Halley flying close to our earth. By refering to the direction given by press, my siblings and i was outside the house looking at the stary skies, searching for the so called Halley Comet. We did not use any sophisticated equipment, just by naked eyes. The stary night was so beautiful without disturbance by cloud. Suddenly, i saw a light dot moving trememdous fast and make a sharp turning at about 120 degrees. Its latitud (height) was unknown. At first i thought that was a meteor and finally surprised when seeing it made a sharp turning. I immediately ask my brother to see. Unfortunately it was too late, the thing vanished in the dark.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I wish I had had my camera.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I saw a flaming torch-like light. I, at first, thought it to be an airplane on fire. It streaked accross the sky from west to east. (south east direction) It was traveling very normanl like a plane would until I saw it as close as 90 feet above my head. It looked liked a cone shaped re-entry vehicle similar to early space flight of the 1960s.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I saw it that close I saw its color change from orangeish to cold hard grey steel moving at snail pace. I thought it might be a bomb. It made no noise and no one got out. It must have crashed near the freeway by the Van Nuys postoffice on Sherman Way abd Haskell in Van Nuys, Ca.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is my experience and it is most definetely not a joke. I told a few people about it and they thought I was nuts.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain semi-anonymous.  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>
