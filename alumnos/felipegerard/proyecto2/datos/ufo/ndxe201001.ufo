From the East coming towards our direction at approximately 200 feet in the distance swopped down a craft resembling an egg shape laying on its side.  As it came towards us it was approximately 100 feet in the air and 1/4 of it was lit in  a yellow tone light resembling a cock pit.  I noticed 4 shadowy figures moving within the craft cockpit which appeared VERY tall and slender with  long arms, and large heads.  Three were standing one was sitting. The craft itself was luminious resembling a flare one puts on top of a birthday cake.  It had deffinate shape and boundries where a flare on a cake does not.  It passed over head and made NO sound what so ever.  It was VERY fluid in motion, no jerks, no wobbling, and no sound. It glided approximately 150 feet straigt and stopped.  Simply stopped.  Stood there motionless for approximately 5 minutes and then shot directly up.  We watched the lit up craft go straight up till it became a pin prick size of light.  There were no stars in the sky but when i came out of the market the sky was lit with stars znd the smallest of the stars was approximately 3 times the size of the craft at its tiniest.  The craft had no head lites and it not leave a trail of light.  The fact that it was soundless and the fluidity of its motion and the way it just &#34;sat&#34; in the sky with no movement of any kind and than simply shot straight up till it became a pinpoint of light.  I don&#39;t recall the moon being out at the time for size comparison however it did not appear overly large as it flew over head perhaps 50 feet across.  The windshield was free of divisions and was 1/4 of the crafts size.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There were two other woman observing both unknown to me one  who took a phone picture as the craft hovered.  The older woman was approximately 50 years of age and was with her daughter who appeared to be in her mid to late 30&#39;s both were strangers to me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I called the Boca Raton Police the next day who appeared uninterested and didn&#39;t even take a report.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I than searched the web and reported it to you, I also called at the time and left a message.<n>
1/31/10 13:00|Stone Mountain|GA|Triangle|60-70 seconds|Triangular object hovers, darts away,  then disappears over Stone Mountain|2/8/11|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/079/S79988.html|2|ndxe201001| Triangular object hovers, darts away,  then disappears over Stone Mountain<n> <n><n> <n><n> I live in walking distance of Stone Mountain and can see one side of the mountain from my house.  I am able to see the top of the mountain.  Atop the mountain is located a visitor’s booth and skyrail station. Next to the skyrail station is a tower with red lights.  I believe it is there due to the Stone Mountain Airport, which I read today was closed in 1996.  The latter statement prompted me to write this letter.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Every single night, I see, what I thought were planes, leaving Stone Mountain.  On the evening of January 31st at around 9pm, I was exiting my home and saw a bright light, as the light on the front of a plane lifting up in the sky.  At first it began to rise straight upward. It was not going up at an angle, like a plane taking off, so I studied the object.  It raised straight up in the air very very slowly at first.  (It was coming up above the skyrail station)   Once the object reached a height where it was still visible but higher than the tree line, the tower, and etc, the object darted off to my right (this would have been the objects left if the light truly was the front of the object).  I followed the object for a few moments, about 40 seconds in my car. It suddenly got faster and faster until it disappeared.  It was as if the object evaporated.<n> <n><n> <n><n> While I was able to see the object, begging my boyfriend to take a video  (He was too clumsy and nervous), we agreed that the object was shaped as a triangle.  It had one red light on the right end of the &#34;wing&#34; and triangle positioned lights along the object.  There was what appeared to be like a search light on the bottom of the object and it was difficult to tell, but it looked like a blinking blue light was on the end of the opposite &#34;wing.&#34;  The lights were triangular in location and appeared to number about 8.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There are planes coming from there every night.  Planes were even coming towards the object that night but were much higher in altitude and moving slower as it darted and then disapperaed.  I was surprised to hear the airport closed in 2006.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was even more surprised once I researched UFO sightings and saw 2 exact descriptions online.  This prompted me to add validity to the statements made by the other two people who reported the triangular object with the lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have not studied the rest of the &#34;planes&#34; leaving Stone Mountain, but it does not look like they are all &#34;rising up&#34; in the air directly.<n>
1/31/10 06:30|Milwaukee|WI|Light|4-6 min|Very large, bright moving searchlight, but no plane or helicopter in sight to be making it.|2/14/10|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/074/S74354.html|3|ndxe201001| Very large, bright moving searchlight, but no plane or helicopter in sight to be making it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My grandfather and I were flying on a plane from Milwaukee and stopping in Atlanta, GA, from there to go to Cancun and on to Cozumel.  It was about 6:30 in the morning, and we had just taken off.  The sky was dark and clear with very few clouds, and it was my second time on an airliner so I was looking out through the window.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As we were passing over a town outside of milwaukee, I noticed a large spotlight passing over a few neighborhoods.  The yards and streets that it passed over were brightly illuminated.  You could see the grass in the fields and chimneys on the rooftops and such as they were being lit up as the light was passing, and you could see the outline of the light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I looked to see a helicopter or even a plane generating the light but I could not find one.  I told my grandpa to look over and check it out and he said he didn&#39;t know what it was either.  I was tempted to ask a flight attendant but noticed they were pretty busy, so I just let it go.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The moon was out and full, but i&#39;ve never heard of the moon creating such a focused, concentrated light of which I saw. I followed the light up and you could see the light was in a conic, searchlight projection, but nowhere was there anything to be making it.  No tower, plane, or helicopter.  The light seemed to be shining down from about 1-2 hundred feet up.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I followed the light for a good 2-3 minutes and then it dissapeared.  It was sort of making the same path as the plane, except that it had more of a wavy pattern slowly angling away from the plane and it moved very quickly. It came back into sight again shortly after and then it just vanished, like if someone just flipped off the switch.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I don&#39;t know if anybody else had seen it, but it was clearly something strange.  If it were being emitted from some sort of aircraft, the plane had amazing stealth technology because the only thing seen was its searchlight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date is approximate.

1/31/10 00:14|Boston, Lincolnshire (UK/England)||Light|40 Seconds|Boston, Lincolnshire-Bright Circular Light|2/14/10|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/074/S74247.html|4|ndxe201001| Boston, Lincolnshire-Bright Circular Light<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had been skating from around 20:40-00:30 last night with two friends. Just before we packed up for the night we noticed a white light in the sky, half the size of the moon which may have been pulsating. I know for certain that we saw this light at 00:14 as I took 6 photos of it on my phone and the photos are dated 00:14-00:15 31/01/2010, none of the photos appear to show anything special, although when put in negative three of the six photos show a small dark circle (my phones camera is only 2.0 MegaPixels).<n> <n><n> <n><n> I first noticed the light while sitting down. I was tired from all the skating, so was laid back on a bench outside the TK Maxx store looking up at the sky and saw it &#39;float&#39; into the corner of my eye. It was high in the sky, probably 20 thousand feet up and just stayed in the same spot for nearly a minute. Both of my friends saw it. At the very end it took off and went right over the town very quickly. That was the last we saw of it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.  PD))<n>
1/30/10 19:00|Oakland|CA|Triangle|5-10 sec|Three transluscent, reddish-colored, orbs in a perfect triangular pattern fly overhead at a constant speed.|2/14/10|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/074/S74245.html|5|ndxe201001| Three transluscent, reddish-colored, orbs in a perfect triangular pattern fly overhead at a constant speed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This day, January 30, 2010 at approximately 19:00 hours, I as well as two others were witness to a UFO flying overhead. At the base of the Oakland Hills, myself as well as three other friends, were on the outdoor deck of a penthouse on the fourth floor of an apartment building. Our focus was on the horizon just over the hills due to the reason that a friend mentioned that the moon rises so quickly at night over the hill. While we were waiting as we observed the glow of the moon thru the fog rolling over the hill, two of the three friends went into the house (the residents of the apartment.) I remained outside because at 25 years of age I had never witnessed the moonrise before. While the other and myself were anxiously waiting for the moon to peak over the hill he shouted, “ A UFO, a UFO!!!” I immediately looked to where he was pointing and I saw a triangle shaped object. It was three translucent reddish-colored orbs in a symmetrical “pyramid” shape. The top! of the triangle, the point, was at the head of the direction it was moving. It was moving at a higher rate of speed at an altitude higher than that of planes that regularly fly over the same area. Its rate of speed during the sighting never wavered. It remained at a constant speed throughout the sighting. At the time it was in our field of view, there was not one other plane or object in the sky. The only things in the sky in view were the stars. When he shouted, the male resident of the apartment raced out to the deck (back patio) and immediately saw the UFO. He was the only one who said he “heard” it. Myself as well as the other fellow who first observed the object did not hear anything. It was just “gliding” thru the sky. I have never seen anything like it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was funny or odd to me that several minutes after the sighting, as we were all in amazement of what we had just observed, I noticed the sky began to fill up with airplanes flying overhead. This was odd to me due to the fact that when the UFO was in the sky there were no other objects present except the sky and stars. Several seconds soon after the UFO traveled out of our field of view, is when planes began to fly in their respective patterns overhead.<n>

To the naked eye it appeared to be one wide very tall column of bright light.  With binoculars and through a telescope there were three large distinct but undulating round lights one on top of the other.  At times the middle light would expand outward to the left (northeast) and would become milky and poorly organized.  It appeared to remain stationary and then moved slowly toward Nubble Light and then moved back toward Kennebunk Beach then back again toward the Nubble Light where it remained until it disappeared.  The Coast Guard thought it might be a tanker with halogen lights waiting to enter Portsmoutn Harbor.  The strange thing was that because of the full moon and clear skies though we could clearly see the outline of the Nubble Lighthouse we were never able to see any outline of a ship even with binoculars or the telescope. The Coast Guard asked questioned that over and over again ! and kept me on the telephone for 10 minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

1/29/10 19:40|Edinburg|TX|Cigar|5 minutes|At about 7:40pm a cigar shaped object at a great distance started doing zig-zags, before joining 5 or more objects.|2/14/10|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/074/S74233.html|9|ndxe201001| At about 7:40pm a cigar shaped object at a great distance started doing zig-zags, before joining 5 or more objects.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was walking towards the science building in my University, and took a shorcut through a small field in between sidewalks. At this moment I started glancing as the stars and the moon, as it is at its brightest today.  I first noticed a very small, faint cigar shaped object going by at a relatively steady speed in between two stars, my first thought was it being a satellite, and instantly told my girlfriend who was walking with me to look upwards, she had some trouble seeing it as the object was relatively above us, and there were no objects in the ground to help give an idea of its precise location.  After a few seconds she managed to get a small look at it, before her eyes gave way and got teary, making her look away and loose sight of the object.  It was at this time that I first noticed a very disturbing behavior in the object as it made a very small zig zag across the sky, and then proceeded to join about five or so objects in a kind of formation, these! other objects appeared to have suddenly emerged as this happened or maybe my sight was so fixed upon the amazing maneouver the  first object had just made. All the objects dissapeared within a couple of seconds and then suddenly reappeared for a few seconds more before I lost sight of them for good.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

My attention was immediately stolen by what looked to be a oval shaped object hovering over the field approximately 200-300ft. in the air (that would be my best guess).  The object was not moving, and was not emitting any lights or sounds, but I could tell the object was shiny due to the fact the sun was reflecting off of the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As a passed a few trees, and my line of sight was broken, I looked back in the general area only to find the object was gone.  I slowed down my car from  about 30mph to about 15mph and scanned the sky and the fields that I could see, but the object had disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I immediately called a friend of mine and told him what I had saw, and asked another friend or two how I could obtain information pertaining to anyone else reporting  a strange object in the area.  They suggested contacting the county and/or state authorities.  My plan is to contact them in the next day or two and ask about any reports of a ‘low flying aircraft’ in the past week.  This area hasn’t been known to have many UFO sightings to my knowledge, nor have I witnessed anything like this area here before, but I know I’m am now more intrigued than ever to learn, document, and report any strange sighting or occurrences from this area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have sent a sighting report to the HBCC UFO Research as well with the same information I have provided in this report.<n>
1/29/10 13:00|Canada|MB|Disk|2 min|On my way home I saw an UFO|2/14/10|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/074/S74231.html|11|ndxe201001| On my way home I saw an UFO<n> <n><n> <n><n> When my family and I were traveling home, on our gravel road we saw something in the sky.  I was the one who saw it first.  I said, &#34;Is that a plane?&#34;  My companion said, &#34;I don&#39;t know.  It isn&#39;t spewing polution that&#39;s for sure.&#34;   And, being me, I looked at (As I suppose) all the logical reasons that I could think of. I said,  &#34; Could it be a one of those small planes?&#34;  My comanion said,  &#34;No, too high.&#34;  I suggested a helicopter, a weather balloon, I even suggested mabey a new non polluting air craft.  Each suggestion got more and more desprate.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Since the UFO was so high in the sky, it was hard to tell for certain what shape it was.  It was always bright.  Like if you were to watch a plane pass the sun.  It would naturally become very bright.  The UFO that I saw was like that.  Just the brightness never faded.  It was moving incredibly slow.  My companion, who is a very logical person also, slowed the car to a creep, to look at it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We lost sight of it as we entered our drive way.  Though, I could of sworn, that I saw it sort of fade away before we lost sight of it.  I could of imagined it but, whatever.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

I could see a little bit of twinkling like you sometimes see around a star, but could see some red color. I got the binoculars to look and this large white center light had pulsing green and red lights the whole way around it. It was just above the tree line on the horizon. I ran to get my camera, took a couple pictures inside and tried unsuccessfully to get the flash off.  I went outside on the deck and took a couple of pictures of it. All of this took about ten minutes. The entire time it remained still.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I ran upstairs to wake my husband who came down. He looked out through the sliding door and said it was gone. However, when we got out on the deck, beyond the roof, we saw it again about 10-15 degrees higher in the sky, still not moving, just staying still.  It started to move fast toward  our house. When it got close we could briefly hear a humming noise. When I could no longer see it from the deck I ran inside and out the front door. Just that quickly it was completely gone. We live in the country with no outside lights so the sky is dark and visible from one horizon to the next.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The red and green lights were not airplane lights as we see those fairly often.  These lights totally surrounds the bright circle of light and were all flashing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The picture that I took shows groups of lights that look like they are hooked together with lines. The numerous lights, although not colored, are fairly accurate. The lines, I think, are from my not holding the camera completely still.  The picture was taken with a Kodak digital and only shows a faint light in the center of the picture. When I put it on the computer and zoomed in you could see different lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We have lived here since 1969 and have never seen anything like this.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Rainier but it’s a disclosed location and I go to the sattva sanctuary at Mt. Adams where all are welcome to “sky fish” as we call it…   Anyway long story short because I have plenty of pictures….<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was outside in my backyard….and I noticed a light...the light turned orange within a few seconds and started to flare a bit then disappeared as a series of smaller white lights “kind of like smaller twinkling stars” started appearing and forming a quadrangle or half diamond shape. I knew then that I was dealing with the same lights I go far off into the woods to see….so I immediately grabbed a camera and started taking pictures  The small white flickering lights stayed in the sky for awhile as a couple slightly visible orbs or orb like entities started flying around the backyard….you could just see them but it was hard….so I started taking pictures…..and there were a lot more than expected….at one point I took a picture of my brother and it was terrifying what came back.  The largest orb “the one you could see visibly best” kept following me…I have the pictures he followed me right to the sliding glass door…then went over to the kitchen window and waited….I didn’t know what to do I mean it’s obviously an intelligent being…so I didn’t say anything out loud but I did say….you’re welcome inside come in and maybe try and interact?  Well sure enough it came flying through and another one behind it “I have pictures of all of this” a lot more came in than expected and sort of started just cruising around….but at one point they started building these holographic type structures…you could BARELY see them with your eye…but you could see them rather well with a big flash on your camera...<n> <n><n> <n><n> All that happened after that is they made these beautiful elaborate transparent structures “I have pictures of all this” but then I noticed once they were finished….creatures started coming out…and not the friendly kind “I have pictures” some pretty scary looking and very strange things….it almost seemed like hologram like they were just manifested images not actual reality because some of the entities and creatures were just so different and unreal…  Anyway I still see a lot of orbs….no weird pictures of anymore creatures I just try and stay positive…my friend was saying they could be something called reptilians these evil aliens who are from another dimension…however these did seem like they could be either from another dimension or at least light spectrum…but I wasn’t too keen on the idea they seem pretty harmless….a little frightening at times….but harmless….I hope  If you have any further inquiries or would like to come visit infrared cameras REALLY help so does any type of night vision….I’ve been using a basic camera and I can see a couple orbs and other funny shaped light structures flying around almost every picture I take…I have about 300…don’t worry I won’t send them all…  Thanks for your time guys  This is not a joke either please at least look at the pictures before you think its all nonsense….thanks<n>

The first night, as we got nearer, the lights faded, one actually separated into two lights close together, one slightly higher than the other, and then both slowly got dimmer and disappeared.  Last night, the second night we were driving back the same way at the same time, and the lights were visible in the same place.  This time my husband and I were determined to get closer to them, so we drove down toward Bayport all the way to the river&#39;s edge, but lost them behind the trees while we were driving.  The planets Mars and Saturn were clearly visible higher up in the sky, unblinking, and were not these lights.  I will go ! back to the spot at 8:30 pm tonight with a camera and try to photograph it if the objects are visible.<n>

I watched it for about 30 seconds as it traveled at a normal speed for a plane when without warning it instantly accelerated at an alarming rate, left a short dull light trail and disappeared.  I have seen my share of meteor showers and I have never seen one change speed, and I dont think that it could have been one simply for the fact of it cruising at a normal speed and then speeding off.<n>

I saw lights hovering for many minutes wondering what it was off in the distance.  Typically I see planes flying low along this stretch of highway because they are landing at March Air Reserve Base, but this was no jet.  I was just north of Ethanac exit when the object was directly overhead.  The object had caused many of the drivers on the freeway to slow and gaze upward.  I pretty much stopped and stared up at a huge black triangle.  There were 3 lights, white, not blinking at all at each apex.  The triangle was equilateral in shape.  It did not make any noise. The object was between 150-250 ft across, from tip to midpoint of opposite edge.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I exited the freeway and made two rights to head north again.  I phoned home and told my girlfriend what happened.  I tried to catch up to the object but with recent rain and poor quality of roads as well as obeying traffic laws I could not get underneath it again.  Eventually I pulled over and watch it float northward directly over the base and continue going.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Background of witness: •	College Graduate:  BS Geography •	31 year old male •	Long time resident of area where triangle observed •	Working professional for large geographic science software company •	20/20 vision – good health (mentally and physically) •	Familiarity with commercial and military aircraft shapes and sizes. Personally witnessed B2 stealth bomber flying over Chargers stadium during super bowl. What I saw was not a b2 bomber.  Lived just north of NAS Miramar for many years.<n> <n><n> <n><n> •	Upon reading findings from The National Institute for Discovery Science regarding triangle sightings I decided to report what I saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

(I live 2 blocks from the water; Clear Lake, Gulf of Mexico).  The flight pattern resembled birds flying around each other.  As they got closer, it was apparent that they were not birds.  There were 2 spheres flying around each other, on a rotating axis.  As they flew over me, the axis became perpendicular with the ground.  At that point, they were in a rotating pattern, alternating there rotation 180 degrees, back and forth, all the while, traveling in a straight line from the SE.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The sighting lasted approximately 45 seconds to 1 minute.  Line of sight was approximately 160 to 170 degrees.  The size of the objects I would compare to a common Frisbee at 100 ft.  The 2 objects were black in color, and identical in size to each other.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am ex USAF. I have lived in this area for the last 10 years.  My proximity to Johnson Space Center (NASA) and Ellington Field has afforded me the opportunity to see most all normal activity in the area.  (T-38s, F-14s etc.)<n>

I work one block away from the freeway; they would have been right over the freeway. They looked too spherical to be any other aircraft I know of. The UFOs were also moving with uncanny maneuverability and it was a weird mélange of white, and a clear metalic sheen. One was flying more erraticly with sharp quick turns as the ortherone was keeping pace but flying more smoothly. The crafts were too small to be helicopters and far too symetrical. Theydissapeared for about half second and reapeared for about 3 seconds and dissapeared compleatly. One last remark, the crafts were flying pretty low and wereclearly visible... If you happenned to be looking at the clear bluesky during those 5 seconds, I suppose.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I looked and saw this really bright light.  My camera is dead, so we looked at it through the scope of his rifle.  It was crescent shaped and appeared to be moving, as the light was brighter at times.  I could see it above the trees and power lines in the field beside our house.  Then suddenly it disappeared, only to reappear a few minutes later only dim, which we assumed meant it was farther away from us.  I got the feeling though, when i was looking through the scope, that it was looking at me. The bright light seemed to focus on me for a few minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It is back again : 4:50 on the opposite side of the tree.  And is gone again:4:55<n>

It was just standing still then it moved south about four miles in a matter of two seconds, at this point I saw the shape of the object it was triangular shape.  It kept on moving south then it took off it disappear.<n>

It moved from east to west and stopped, until 3 am we looked at the mysterious triangular object which seemed like it was just floating up and down.  It kept on turning its light on and off.  It reflected a purple light which was a combination of blue and red lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was amazing to see it with my husband for he didn&#39;t believe at all, and now I have a proof, he was there standing right next to me and was also amazed for what he saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Well, to see is to believe!<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness does not indicate a date for the sighting.

He took a min sighed and looked at the object, and said &#34;what is that?&#34;  I noticed then that the object was getting closer. The star object stopped and turned around I noticed then that  It was not a star but a reflection of the lights around us. It was dark Diamond shaped and it was about 500 ft. verticle.  Its edges glinted from the lights around us. It was a square or diamond shaped mirror that you could see through.  The contours suggested that it was not flat but edged and not rounded.  It shook dropped about 5-10 feet then shot in a western direction.  When leaving the area it was almost impossible to see when it began to shake.<n>

I was driving to Wilkesboro to pick up a friend when I spotted the first two.  They were saucer shaped and flashing white, blue, red, green, and would glow bright amber.  They didn&#39;t move much until we were on our way back to Boone. One of them skimmed the horizon, hovering, drifting, close to the mountain tops, before zooming off into the distance.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We drove up to Deep Gap to sky watch, which is where we saw the third.  It was so bright.  I could make out an eclipse of light that hinted at a spherical, not saucer shape.  A white light sometimes flashed red and scanned around the area.  It didn&#39;t move much besides a gentle wobble and the occasional dip.  Several planes passed through the air field, but as usual, took no notice of the strange crafts.<n>

I am a pilot and always interested in aircraft.  The commercial traffic here is about 3,000 to 4,000 AGL as they approach straight in to LAX.  While looking at one aircraft on approach my eyes were drawn to a spherical reflective object directly above it approximately 1,500 - 2,000 feet.It was highly reflective and pulling very tight circles, very fast.  Far to fast to be a bird. To tight to be a conventional aircraft.  I watched this object do this for about two minutes before it shot to the SW at incredible speed.  My mind stuggled to comprehend what just saw.  Whatever it was it was manuvering directly in the flightpath of numerous aircraft in some of the most congested airspace in the U.S.<n>
1/27/10 06:00|Fort Collins|CO|Light|8 min|Very Bright in due West, Hovered about 2 min's, then accelerated very fast stright up.|2/14/10|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/074/S74206.html|28|ndxe201001| Very Bright in due West, Hovered about 2 min&#39;s, then accelerated very fast stright up.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Driving due west toward the mountains, approaching north HWY 287 in Fort Collins, I saw a very bright light between 18 to 20 degrees west above the mountains.  At first I dismissed this as a planet, as it looked as if it was stationary.  The time was about 6:48am and in Fort Collins, this is during Civil Twilight where the sun is 6 degrees or less below the horizon. (Sun rise is at 7:08am).  I was about to dismiss this object and turn north to go home, when I had to stop at a red light.  I lined up three points using my Bronco, a tree for line of sight, just to make sure that the object was not moving.  I watched it hover for about 10 or 15 seconds, when I noticed that it was indeed moving very slowly.  At first, I thought that this was my imagination, but the object started to accelerate, and I knew it was not a planet.  When the light turned green, I did not turn north, but went through the intersection and pulled over as fast as I could.  I got out of my Bronco, and watched for about 30 seconds.  The object moved about 1/3 the distance it was from the ground in about 4 seconds.  It accelerated very quickly, and then disappeared.  Still assuming that this might be a Jet that was reflecting the sun light, and possibly approaching my line of sight until it turned, which would look as if it were hovering, and then accelerating, I went home and crunched the numbers.  This is what I got:  The altitudes of most commercial jets are about 30,000 feet.  If the object was 18 to 20 degrees from my line of sight, that would make it 16.61 to 18.32 miles away from me.  I went to Fort Collins airport, and found the visibility for 7:00am, and it was 10 miles.  This indicated that the object was close to double the distance for visibility.  With the sun hitting an object, one might still be able to see it, so I calculated the speed. It the object moved 1/3 its altitude in 4 seconds, then it would be traveling close to 2400 feet per second, (rounding off).  This equates to 1630 mph, which commercial jet cannot do.  My conclusions suggest that unless this was a military craft that was reflecting the sun and traveling directly into my line of sight, (which made it look like it was hovering for over two minutes), and then shot straight up at a climbing rate of 1630 mph, then it is something unique.  Lastly, if the object was indeed moving at a velocity of 1630 mph, and was coming directly at me for over two minutes, then it would have covered a distance of 54 miles, which would have brought the craft over my head in less than 60 seconds, which it did not do.  I would be interested if anyone else saw this object from another direction so I can get better numbers.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

I went outside to see a low flying jet of either the F-14 or F-16 shape.  Oddly, however, as it banked by raising one wing I saw absolutely no markings of any kind on the totally gun-metal grey plane.  Oddly, too, there was a smaller Cessna-like one engine plane flying very close to the &#39;jet.&#39;<n> <n><n> <n><n> At this time another witness, an TV/internet installer at my house came outside and I pointed up at the craft.  He looked at it and thought it was a F-14 as he was familiar with some jet craft.  He, too, thought it odd that the &#39;jet&#39; had no markings on it and that he thought the smaller plane was flying with the jet somehow.  The &#39;jet&#39; flew in the exact same pattern as the night observations I made, coming from the east, flying around my house in a low flight pattern, then heading back east again over the  town of Narragansett and out to sea.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I called the South Kingstown police again.  I reported what I had seen and the dispatcher said, &#39;one minute please&#39; as he went away for 3 or 4 minuted before coming back to talk to me to report that all he knew was that he was told by someone that the &#39;jets&#39; came from an air base on Cape Cod somewhere and he said that was the official explanation.  I thanked him for taking my call.  I then called the Air National Guard at Quonset Pt. in North Kingstown to see what they knew.  I could not  get to talk to anyone as I had on the morning of the 22nd, Friday, where a Sergeant with the Air National Guard told me there were no jets reported to him and none were at the Quonset location (only C-130s and helicopters).  He said that Air Defense in Providence would have picked them up on radar anyway.  He also said that he was at home in Narragansett the night before and had in fact heard but not seen the &#39;jets.&#39;<n> <n><n> <n><n> I also this morning called Senator Reed of Rhode Island&#39;s office to see if they knew anything about these flights.  A woman who answered the phone knew nothing but took my name and phone number and said she or someone would call me back but I have not heard from the Senator&#39;s office the rest of today.<n> <n><n> <n><n> By the way, I saw no lights on the F-14/16 like craft in this daytime observation as well as no markings on the craft.<n>

I&#39;m also a private pilot.  The time was about 7PM.  I walked outside of my gatehouse and was looking west toward the ocean.  Its a very clear night with unlimited visibility. I can see stars and jets at 30k feet strobe lights flashing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Out of the corner of my eye to the north I could see what I thought was a jet landing at fort myers intl airport or Naples even.  The light was small and amber in color like a Boeing jet.  It had a little kind of comet tail that was the same color as the light behind it that I could see as it moved closer and passed over my head going south.  It moved from north to south like it was flying down the Florida coast but at 50-100k feet.  It was moving a lot faster then the other jets and had no flashing lights of any kind.  It took maybe 45 seconds to a minute for the light to disappear over the South horizon.  It looked like a star floating across the sky.  Perfectly round amber light.  I thought it was a jet until it passed over my head going south and it was just as bright as it was coming at me.   Like the headlights of a 737 coming at you but when its going away.?  Jets don&#39;t use landing lights on at cruise altitude?  The object appeared to be very high and was moving quicker then the other jets that I could see and pick out in the sky.  I saw a amber ball of light travel from North to South at a high rate of speed that didn&#39;t look like anything I have ever seen before including the ISS.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I also witnessed the 3 red lights over Naples park on new years.  It was a nice size triangle with 3 red lights that hovered and took off north. If looked like it had to be huge.  I couldn&#39;t see a outline but it looked to be one object.  There&#39;s a movie of it on you tube.  This thing whatever it was flew around and took off to the North without makeing a noise.<n>

It wasn&#39;t completely dark yet.  I noticed a round shaped golden light coming toward me from the north, heading south, and I watched its progress until trees got in the way.  At first I just thought it was a plane, but it looked too big, because I couldn&#39;t hear a sound from it.  I saw two little balls of light blink on and off along the sides a couple times, they were white.  I thought planes had colored lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I ran to keep sight of it, and saw it again.  I expected to be able to see it disappear in the distance, growing smaller. Instead it disappeared instantly.  By that time I was wondering what it was.  I am familiar with satellites, have seen several flying over here.  This was visually larger and and maybe a little slower.  Wild guess at altitude would be 3000 feet.<n>

I am up at 4:45am every morning, went out to have a smoke.  The skys were clear, both mornings, I saw what looked like a star, except it was moving very fast.  I watched it go from north to south over the mountains, as i watched it ,i saw another one coming from the south heading to the north.  They passed each other and i watched them till they were out of my sight. As I pondered over what i just saw and was trying to explain it away in my mind, I saw another,now my mind is really racing. I watched it till  it was gone. Then another,going north. This time I said in my mind if this is really happening then make that moving star go faster.  That, whatever it was, shot off and was gone in a second. scared the crap out of me and i went in side The next morning i went out hesitantly, and saw the same, moving stars. I had this feeling that the star new that i was watching it, and i swear that i saw this star move up and down. I did not believe my own eyes so i thought in my mind to move in a circle and it did. Right away too.  Still, i am not convinced on what  was happening. I thought  show me more  prove to me this is happening. I saw 2, what looked like shooting stars in about 1 minute. Then i saw a very dark mass of something go over ahead of my town.  Well needless to say, I was done. I ran in my house Stopped thinking and have be searching sites for info ever since.<n>

For the past several months, my wife and I have seen a bright white light in our bedroom. This light lasts for only an instant and is unlike any light from a lamp or car light, At times it has been just a point of light,other times a bright white light that fills the room. A few nights ago the light was extremely bright and came in two quick pulses.The light does not come  at any set time or night, but appears randomly. My wife is getting rather upset and frightened at this, as we can find no explanation as to why this is happening.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Does your organization have any records of such an occurance,or have any idea what these lights may be? We live in northern Ontario in Canada in a small town in our own house. We are both in our late 50&#39;s and retired.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thank you for your time.<n>

I could not pinpoint the direction of flashes. At first I thought it may be lightening, but I had my moonroof open and I noticed that the cloud cover was broken and scattered at the time and there were no thunderstorms in the area. I thought this was odd, but I quickly disregarded it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The traffic flow on the interstate began banking to the right and heading in a west bound direction. After about 1.5 miles of going westbound, I noticed what appeared to be a commercial jet making a landing approach from over the bay waters, with landing lights. It made its approach over the shoreline in the general area of Bayshore and Hyde Park.  However, I then noticed that it seemed to be taking a long time for this jet to make its approach. I then slowed down and the lights seemed to be at a standstill and hovering  just short of the opposite lanes of the interstate expressway at about 300-feet in altitude and a quarter mile downrange from me. At about this time I then realized that what appeared to be landing lights took on a  rapid “twinkling” appearance as I closed distance on it. I then reduced my speed even more to get a better look and as I did, it went from a hovering standstill and then quickly “scooted” across all 8 lanes of I-275 in a matter of just a few seco! nds. As the object crossed over the interstate directly in front of me and all oncoming traffic, I then noticed that the entire middle of the object from end to end was illuminated in what seemed to be a grid of yellow, green and blue lights in a rotating pattern.  At this point, I thought It might be a blimp, but as I drove past it, to my dismay, I could clearly see that the lights were rotating around the circumference of a circle. There was no noise or any other anomalies.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After it quickly “scooted” across the interstate it then stopped and hovered over an older and darker section of the city with few street lamps and when it did, the colors became very vivid and seemed to pop out visually and become brighter as they rotated rapidly around its circumference. I also noticed that rotational speed of the lights seemed to have varied becoming faster after it passed over my direction on the interstate.  As the object hovered in darkness, it then became apparent to me that this thing was big. I cannot even estimate a size in feet, but visually, It was the size of a nickel held at arms length in your hand.  As I was attempting to make a phone call to my spouse to tell her about what I saw (She has also seen lights of this description in the past), I looked over twice to see if it was still there and it did not move after it crossed the interstate.  Based on the rotation of vivid multicolored lights around its circumference and its ability hover, then! quickly pick up speed and have no noise, I am confident that this was not a regular aircraft.  I am at a loss to figure what it was and I am not sure if the flashes of light I had seen a couple of minutes earlier were linked to what I saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

There&#39;s someting distinctive about this light, and as an Aircraft pilot myself am posstive that it is not an aircaft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A week or too later I was working in the evening in Abingdon again spotted the same light.  It&#39;s quite distinctive, an orange glow very bright and moves slowly.  Over the last week or so I have witnessed this light on a few ocassions, each around the same time 22 to 23 hrs and in the same area of sky over Abingdon.  Even when the cloud base is low the light is clearly visable and there is no aircraft noise associated with it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> However tonight approaching Abingdon around 22:45 there were 3 distingtive individual bright lights all identical in an almost triangular patten again moving slowly,but in different directions.  I had been driving at the time so wasn&#39;t able to obsereve exactly when they dissapeared but after about 5 minuites observing the same area where the lights had been seen they had dissapeared.<n>

After making sure there were no aircraft to be seen or heard in the area, we shone the laser pen at a few stars (you have to make sure there are no aircraft in the area, especially helicopters as it is very dangerous and ILLEGAL to point this thing in the sky when aircraft are present!).<n> <n><n> <n><n> I shone the laser pointer at three stars in the sky which are shaped like a triangle, They&#39;re in the west of the sky and are visible most nights. After touching each star with the laser beam I put the laser pen into my back pocket and lit a cigarette while me and my friend chuckled because I was putting on a stupid voice while pointing at the stars.<n> <n><n> <n><n> From the east and for approx 1-1.5 seconds a brilliant white sphere with no glare or tail. The object appeared as bright as magnesium burning as it passed over our heads at a speed which was far less than a shooting start, but much faster than any known plane or helicopter.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was no sound and the object looked to be very defined and solid (perfect sphere, or ball).<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have seen many shooting stars, satellites, commercial/military planes and many helicopters.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This object did not fit into any of these criteria, nor did it resemble a comet in any way.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have never seen a large meteor in person but have on video and this object did not in anyway resemble this either.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object was difficult to scale, my friend and I talked for a while and decided it to seemed to looked a little bigger than a passenger jet in the sky but lower than a jet would fly (30,000ft). We cannot verify any size or height of the object as it was very fast, very solid and very visible but so fast that it is hard to from memory alone judge.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object did however, fly quite precisely through the centre of the triangle of stars above, pretty much the centre of the three points I shone the laser!  I have created a couple of images using Google map to point out a rough flight path. I started small then worked out. Which I have emailed to yourselves.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After returning inside My friend tried to use the GPS on his phone to work out the direction of the craft, but the GPS did not work when it usually does there. It said we were out in the bay towards the direction the object flew!  A little while before my Friend and I went out to use the laser we were smoking a cigarette and My Girlfriend, My Friend and I saw two aircraft that looked like helicopters with a droning sound. They had red and green and white lights on them like a normal aircraft but were flashing differently.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I know the red and green lights are used to determine which direction an aircraft is flying so other aircraft don’t hit them. But these red and green lights were alternating and the white light stayed with them. We thought nothing too unusual of these at the time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Many thanks for taking the time to read this report<n>

And then another appeared, as if it came out of the Caribbean Sea.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The first three I saw stayed in formation (I couldn&#39;t tell if they were connected) and continued to fly upwards...into space!

It passed in front of me approximately one hundred feet above the ground.  It traveled at or about the speed of a fast moving single engine aircraft or helicopter.  It didn&#39;t have the normal formation lights you would see on an aircraft.  It had one amber light that flashed at a rate of about 5 times per second.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was not able to determine a shape or size even though it did pass through my headlight beam at a distance of about 300 feet in front of me.

We saw (in clear view) a large red sphere sitting on an abandoned road in the forest as we passed by the entrance to the road, which had been blocked off by the county to prevent cars or campers from entering.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As we passed by, I looked down the road and saw the craft a few hundred feet from the entrance. I slowed down to give my daughter a chance to view the craft with me and we were convinced it was a UFO sitting on the road. It was a solid red sphere, larger than a car or truck and made no sound or movement and emitted a reddish glow.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Due to the necessity to get to Best Buy before closing hours, we continued on and simply had a laugh at the thought of actually seeing a UFO in our forest.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then soon after on Friday night, January 22, 2010 at 11:10 pm, my wife and I watched what appeared to be the same large reddish, glowing colored sphere descend into the woods directly in front of our home from our front porch at about a tenth of a mile from our home. We first spotted it through the front window in our den, while we were watching T.V. by accident. We ran outside to the front porch to get a closer view and watched it as it descended, taking about a minute to get to the ground.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first sighting it was about 80 feet in the air, just above the tops of the trees already in its decent. We watched carefully looking for any signs that it could be identified as an Earthly object. It made no sound at all and proved to be something we’ve never seen before. It was very stable in its control.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was sphere shape at approx. 12 or 15 feet wide and made no noise as it carefully descended very slowly, between tree branches towards the ground, until it could no longer be seen behind the shrubs. It had no flashing lights or created any wind or disturbance of any kind. It did have a small flickering flame at the top that went away during its decent.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I grabbed my flashlight and called my daughter to pile into the car, for a closer look, and drove around the corner to get to the road that ran next to the location it came down at. My wife stayed behind in fear of making contact with visitors.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This forest area is an area of low level marsh land. No power is present. The trees are tall Pines, Oak, and other hard woods with tall Yaupon growth at ground level. There is a stream that runs through the center of the property usually filled with the songs of thousands of frogs but at this time, they were silent! The weather was cool with overcast and a cloud cover ceiling of about 10,000 feet. It was very calm.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On the first pass, from our car, we were looking for the reddish glowing object that was first seen in the air. We drove to the end of the road, watching into the woods but not seeing anything. I made the block and retraced the area for a second time, driving slowly and shinning my flashlight into the forest. Then we noticed a single white light deep in the forest, near the location from where the craft came down, approx. 30 yards from the edge of the road in the forest. It was a light, much like a light emitting from a bulb of about 60 watts but was too deep in the woods to make out its shape or intent. It looked as though it was sitting on the ground. We watched the light for about five minutes with no movement, either around it or near it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then we slowly moved forward, shining our flashlight into the forest edge, when we noticed the outline of a curved, grayish colored, metal craft nestled behind the dense yaupon shrubbery which was about ten feet high. It emitted no light or sound. We could barely see only part of the round side as the craft was hidden behind the foliage, and we were NOT going in for a closer look! We continued to drive forward approximately another hundred and fifty feet when my flashlight caught the reflection of two very large eyes watching us through the shrubs in the forest edge, set back about 25 feet from the road. I stopped the car, rolled down the window, and shone the flashlight into its eyes and watched as it watched us for about the next several minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We noticed that the eyes were about 8 inches apart and glistened like two very large white diamonds in the reflection from my flashlight. They were about seven feet from the ground. Later observation revealed there were no objects in that area in which someone or something could have been standing on, such as a fallen tree. We could not see the body shape as it was very dark with no back light and whatever it was remained hidden behind the Yaupon shrubs. It never blinked or turn away for a moment and made no sound or movement but continued to watch us very closely as we discussed the details of what we were seeing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We ruled out the possibility of it being a deer, or any animals of any type that would be common in the area, and being that we watched the landing of a UFO and sighted the craft just yards away from where it was, it was determined that we were looking into the eyes of an alien visitor. The eyes were forward facing and twinkled as they moved to view us. The iris of the eyes was large, about the size of a quarter and glistened like diamonds in my spotlight and reflected bright white in color. We turned on the car&#39;s interior dome light and waved a couple of times to let him know we were just curious and meant no harm. We felt like he must have been alone and came to that specific area for samples of something for testing, maybe bugs from the forest floor? That could explain the light in the woods, to attract insects.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We felt like he moved away from his space craft, as we got closer to it and he didn’t wish to be noticed by humans in the event we got out looking over his ship. Maybe he just didn’t want to frighten us or was afraid himself! We felt he was rather curious by our presence, maybe even a bit frightened that we had accidently caught him landing and he wished to be left alone, so he stayed hidden. However, taking the opportunity to observe a human family in our Earth bound, “wheeled” car, checking him out as we stayed calm.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I could feel our presence becoming un-wanted as the minuets passed by as he was probably anxious to get out of there before other showed up, maybe not so peaceful and we were taking up too much of his time. As we stared into those large glowing eyes for as long as we did, for some unknown reason, we turned off the flashlight and drove out of the neighborhood and away from the area for quite a distance, discussing the sight of the craft coming down and what a beautiful, majestic sight it was. Only to realize we were driving for no reason away from such a monumental moment in our lives! We turned around and returned to the area only to find that he had departed, light, craft, eyes and all.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We believe he sent us subliminal messages to leave him alone so he could pack up and get on his way without being detected any further. I felt the effect of confusion the next few days and found it difficult to focus my thoughts. It was an odd feeling during the sighting, but once you actually see a landing and the occupants of an alien craft, it feels very natural and like it should be left alone as it must only be our neighbors tending to their business in a natural way, and we really don’t have any place hanging about or getting in their way.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was a satisfying experience. It’s nice to think he is telling his story to his friends and family, in some faraway place, of the nice human family that stopped by for a brief visit while he was on his mission.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About four days later at approx. 8.00 PM, I watched a saucer shape object moving slowly over the same patch of forest with a single, dim red pulsating light on the top at its center. The light was pulsating very slowly, much less than lights on towers or aircraft and it never completely went out between flashes. The top of the saucer was lit up bright white while the bottom of the craft was dark. There was a single beam of white light shining out of the bottom of the craft shinning downward in a cone shape, very bright but was odd in the fact that it did not shine all the way to the ground. In other words it shown down about twenty five feet then came to a clean stop in midair. I watched it until the trees hid it from view. It too made no sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Update: Exactly one year later. On the anniversary date (2-22-11) of the Alien encounter, my daughter and I saw the return of what looked like the same red sphere near our neighborhood at 8:45 PM in the sky. It just appeared in clear skies as we were driving north bound on I-45 approaching the Spring exit, when a bright twinkling object appeared in the sky about six hundred feet off the ground next to the freeway in front of us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It appeared to have white, twinkling flames coming from its bottom moving upward over the round craft. It sparkled like a star and was moving southwards towards us at a slow speed. When we spotted it, it was completely covered with the white flames then it &#34;suddenly&#34; changed directions and its flames began to subside. It began to pick up speed, now moving north bound next to the freeway. My daughter reached for her phone and videoed it. We pulled over to capture the tail end of the sighting. I watch with my naked eyes as it moved away decreasing its &#34;flame&#34;.  We could see the red sphere that we had seen in the forest on two other occasions near our home. Then it just vanished from sight, like it cloaked itself from sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Before it vanished I could see a force field around the craft as it glowed slightly from the energy flame before disappearing. I am guessing that the craft with occupant had returned for an annual checkup on forest samples, etc. It was moving towards our forest near our home. We raced to the house and watched the forest for a while but didn’t see any activity. After all, what the heck can you do in the event that we did find it again? We just felt satisfied that we had been involved with an actual UFO encounter and it’s nice to know the truth! Hope to see him again soon.<n>

I live in a single-family home on approximately 3 acres. The night was clear and cold. I looked up to the stars as I usually do, as we walked in the backyard. Something caught my eye for a moment to the east in the sky. It appeared to be a low flying craft, with a bright light, what I assumed were landing headlights. I see them all the time because my home is situated under a normal flight path for Logan, and there is a municipal small craft airport about a mile from my home so it’s not unusual to see several aircraft in the sky along with the nightly stars, so I didn’t pay much attention. At that time the “light” was approximately 15-20 miles away. As my dog was finishing up her “business” I looked back at the light because I thought the angle of the light was odd. A direction I hadn’t seen before so I stopped and gazed up, facing directly east now the light was of a pattern and configuration I! had never seen before, and I watched and waited for it to come closer, as I am in the habit of doing, I like watching the different jets pass overhead again I spend a lot of time outdoors here especially at night, I have a nice telescope that I enjoy using an outdoor fireplace, so the backyards a lot of fun. Anyway as the “what I think” is a jet gets closer, I start to see odd lights Like on the “belly” The first thing that came to mind was that it must be some promo like you see at the beach, when planes drag those banners in the sky except this must be something knew, because its like so bright and so BIG and there is 2 white lights and this big red sort of like times square blinking symbol. Of what I have no idea. At this point I notice 3 odd things. One the ozone smell is stronger than I&#39;ve ever smelled, the air seems to be electrified somehow and this thing passing directly over me now is NOT A PLANE, it’s something I’ve never seen before, wedge shaped, triangular, si! lent, slow, and HUGE, 2-3 footballs fields huge. I watched it ! pass ove r me, incredulous to what I was seeing, not believing, The craft moved from direct to east to direct west. After it disappeared in the night’s horizon, I went back in the house, sat down and decided I wouldn’t tell anyone, because I don’t want people to think I’m a nut. BUT. Its kind of been bugging me. I think about every day and replay it in my mind several times. I don’t want to keep silent. I saw this thing. I’m not saying its extraterrestrial. But it is something that I have never seen or felt before. And it was so obvious, so UNSTEALTH like, just there. HUGE.  Unfortunately I’m unemployed right now, and my cell phone is “off” so I have no pictures or video,<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC NOTE:  Witness indicates that date of the sighting is approximate.

They appeared to be about a few thousand feet in the air and hundred to a few hundred feet apart.  Four made a sort of square configuration and 1 was trailing behind.  They did not seem connected.  They were headed from the northeast towards the southwest.   It was partly cloudy and the clouds were moving generally to the east.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As the lights moved overhead I noticed an additional 3 trailing behind by a couple of hundred feet and separated a couple of hundred feet.   I watched for about 5 minutes until they disappeared into the clouds.  At there rate of speed it would take about 1 minute to cover ~90 degrees of sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I then went inside for about 5 minutes and then back outside to see if there were more lights.  There were 2 more lights, separated by about the same distance apart, and they also appeared to be coming from the northeast.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At this point, I climbed to my roof to see if I could see any more approaching from the horizon.  I could see a red light traveling above the rio grand river, ~ 5-10 miles away, but heading south.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After watching for ~ 2min and this light disappearing, I waited for another 5 minutes and didn&#39;t see any more lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I teach an astronomy lab at the university, so I am familiar with celestial objects and what conventional aircraft look like at night.  These objects were silent, small, and very bright.  The center of the light was a bright white - red, and seemed to glow solid red.  I&#39;ve never seen anything like it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;m curios if anyone happened to video tape the objects or get a picture.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Please contact me if you have any questions.<n>

He is 41 years of age, of sound mind and does not take any medication that would cause delusions, hallucinations or any other psychological side-effects.  Observer does not take drugs or drink alcohol.  He has worked as an Intelligence Analyst (while running a private consulting company) and has held at least one security clearance with the DOD.  He attempts to disseminate facts with regard to everything that is encountered in life rather than jump to conclusions.  Scientific methods are used as well as advanced electronic equipment for investigating unexplained phenomenon.  Finally, it is important to note that he has been witness to at least 120 unexplained events involving lights/craft/flashes/electromagnetic disturbances/etc but has only recently felt comfortable coming forward to reveal such matters.  Subject feels as if! they are attracted to him.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Witness is a 31 year old female and has worked for the State of Idaho for 9 years up until 2009.  She is currently unemployed however.  She is of sound mind and on no medications. She does not take drugs nor is she prescribed medications that would cause delusions, hallucinations or any other side-effects.  She does drink alcohol but no alcohol was in her system for at least 24 hours prior to event.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Note: The rest of this report will be &#34;penned&#34; in the first-person context by the Observer.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Event: I was getting ready to finally get some sleep after a long week of work, and admittedly, was extremely tired. The hour was very late, but I am actually very accustomed to not getting much sleep. As I was getting ready for bed, I heard what I would describe as a screeching/crackling sound that sounded almost like an animal, though I can&#39;t figure out what type. I went outside my front door to my yard, which is 30 meters from the street and extremely dark. No lights were on in the front portion of the house so there was a very clear view of the sky. The witness exited a few seconds behind me and we both heard the noise again and noticed at approximately 75 degrees E from our location / 20 degrees above the horizon, a dull-white craft circling around the North End of Boise. It was just below the cloud deck which was estimated to be approximately 1800 feet above the ground. It emitted noise a third time and circled around in a somewhat erratic manner. I reached for an extr! emely bright flashlight (StreamLight STRION LED), which is basically about as bright as the high beams of a car... I shined it towards the craft. There was no reflection. However, it did produce the following reactions and data.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 1) Craft stopped suddenly and started heading towards us 2) Craft changed shape and luminosity became greater 3) There was a noticeable crackle sound in the atmosphere (similar to lightning in the distance; note that there was no precipitation nor any Stratocumulus clouds or similar type clouds to produce lightning--nor were the weather conditions such to generate lightning) 4) Craft appeared to be approximately 1000 feet away (based on known distance that flashlight can illuminate and known distance of background objects) 5) Craft was estimated to be about 8-10 meters in diameter  Craft circled for the first 15-18 seconds, then stopped, changed shape and headed towards us, became much brighter, then headed North at an estimated 300-400 mph before disappearing above the clouds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Although there is Boise Airport and Gowen Field, there were no aircraft flying. I have an application (FlightTracker Pro) that tracks flights (including some military aircraft without N-numbers). There was 100% cloud coverage so it was not a planet, star, or satellite. Also note that I track the ISS with &#39;ISSLite&#39;, and satellites with TLE Files on &#39;Satellite Tracker&#39;  I do not know what this object was, but it was the latest in a flurry of objects that I&#39;ve witnessed above Boise in the past year. It&#39;s become one of my hobbies! And it yielded a video that I submitted to Mr. Davenport on Jan 16th. Please come forward if you have any sightings in Boise as I personally can attest to at least 30 that in my opinion, were not aircraft, atmospheric effects, other manmade craft/materials, or near or far space base objects (stars/planets/etc). I have also seen a dramatic increase of meteorites and fireballs over this same period even during periods that aren&#39;t charted as annual meteor showers.<n>

I&#39;d rather see a hockey game than attend a New Age lecture, and believe mine is the kind of personality that would correlate negatively with any variety of crankiness (even if I haven&#39;t done a statistical regression analysis on this). Basically, I don&#39;t, in a general sense, believe in paranormal events, or UFOs, or anything of the sort. Nevertheless, I had an experience I&#39;m at a loss to interpret within a scientific mindset. I still make a small allowance for the possibility that my story might be explained by either the Finnish (not likely) or the Russian military (just conceivable).<n> <n><n> <n><n> My wife and I live in the seaside community of Vuosaari in Helsinki, Finland.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Last winter, on the 21st of January, 2010, at about 23:15 (GMT+2), we were out walking our dog when the following occurred:  - First, at a distance of about 750-1000 m out on the bay (Aurinkolahti), in the direction of Musta Hevonen island, a luminous object suddenly appeared over the horizon. Its shape was that of a parallelepiped, comprising two rhombic and four rectangular surfaces. It shone emerald-green, though with a darker turquoise hue around the edges. This first object was some 40 meters wide across its front face and was stationary for about 30 seconds, hovering at a height of 25-40 m.<n> <n><n> <n><n> From this object &#34;emerged&#34; a number of smaller, shining objects in the shape of cones. These were initially bright yellow but quickly shifted to orange, then to a brilliant white, then bright yellow again. The cones were about 5 m tall and about 1,5-2 m in diameter at the base. They, too, were 25-40 m above the sea, but were moving around rapidly, and the color cycling occurred at a rate of tenths of seconds. We saw them go through about 20-30 such cycles (10 secs).<n> <n><n> <n><n> These smaller objects then merged back into the larger one. While this was happening the aggregate object showed several different hues.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After this the object simply disappeared, although my wife spotted a dark, semi-transparent cloud next to the original location (dark enough to stand out against the night sky), drifting ENE towards Pikku Niinisaari isle.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Finally, we saw another luminous object in the shape of a cone some 40 m tall, hovering at a height of about 20 m over the Uutela promonitory at the bay inlet. It was orange in color, but had other bright hues around the circular base edge. This object was visible for up to 40 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Eventually it vanished completely, while still above the headland.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We stayed to watch the sea for another half-hour, but there was nothing more to be seen. I reported the incident to the Coast Guard, where it was duly recorded.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Friends have suggested it might have been some kind of military drill by the garrison stationed out on Isosaari island, involving signal flares and a weather balloon. I hardly think so, for several reasons. No such drill appears to have been in progress at the time, a balloon, to my knowledge, cannot behave as described, etc. Another possible explanation, at least in theory, would be ball lightning. I don&#39;t buy this either, since ball lightning in winter is exceedingly rare. A third conjecture offered is that it was the lanterns of a large freighter passing in the dark. This too is out of the question, considering the shape and number of the lights, their movements and rapid color cycling, etc. Also, I&#39;m somewhat familiar with maritime traffic in the area, since I live right by the sea, not far from Vuosaari harbor.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In fine, I can find no rational explanation for this phenomenon.  I hardly drink at all, certainly not on weekdays, and wasn&#39;t tired.  During my service in the armed forces I was never one of those who thought they saw &#34;something moving&#34; every time they were on guard duty.  My wife&#39;s mental makeup is similar.  In addition, visibility at sea was relatively good.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.  PD))<n>

As I was driving I looked up in the upper right hand corner of my windshield and I saw what looked like a shooting star or some type of firework.  I have seen shooting stars before but they always look so far away.  What stood out to me was this shooting star scared me because it appeared so close, it seemed to be a few blocks ahead of me.  It kind of looked like fire work show or comet but is didn’t have a long tail.  However I could see clearly that it was shooting in a downward direction in a way that I have never seen a firework do.  It also seemed to be too large to be any type of firework.  Basically it looked like a cylinder shape fire ball that shot down the sky and disappeared before it hit the ground.  It was the strangest thing I have ever seen and at this moment I think I either saw a comet, shooting star or a UFO,<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

There was a driver of another car who pulled over to look at this too.  It became clearer and there were 2 possible 3 red orange lights and the object looked to be triangular.  It then moved off after around 10 minutes.  The am radio had a lot of interference on a signal which is normally crystal clear.  The object moved higher and the red lights were visible before they dimmed and the object moved to the horizon and then seemed to shoot vertically out of sight.  There was no sound. Gardai (Police) helicopter arrived shortly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This event was carried on the BBC 5 live programme Tony Livesy Show and I was interviewed the following Day as there were a  lot of reports of meteors over Dublin Irl.<n>

I heard the jet-like sound of the previous night, went outside to see the same or similar craft with the same loud jet-like noise in the same circular pattern around my house, that is, coming from the east, turning over my house and then heading back east toward the ocean.  I got a good look at the lights on the craft and they did not resemble at all the lights on a jet; the lights were two solid red non blinking circles.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I call the South Kingstown police as I did the previous night, spoke with the officer/dispatcher who took my call seriously.  I told him that the craft resembled UFOs and not jets by the lighting pattern on them.  The second craft was only briefly seen as a red light and was to the north of the closer craft, which was almost directly over my house.  The dispatcher said he would call the state police to see what they knew.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I didn&#39;t hear any more about it until the next night while watching the evening news at my mother&#39;s house some 30 miles away.   Apparently many calls came in to the news station (either WJAR-TV or WPRO-TV, both in Providence, as I can&#39;t remember which station I had on).  The TV reported said the &#39;mystery jets&#39; were training runs by jets based on &#34;Cape Cod.&#34;   He did not say where.  There is only one air base on Cape Cod, in Massachusetts, and that is at Otis Air Base in Mashpee.  They were quick with the report and merely flashed to an archive photo of jets lined up and they were not the &#34;F-16s&#34; that the news station mentioned as coming from Cape Cod.  It seemed like a cover-up story to me the way it was presented.<n>

I was really excited, but my wife didn’t seem to fazed over it, and sort of took the wind out of my sails because she didn’t think it was anything from another world, and it may not of been, I’d like to know if this explanation is consistent with things like a weather balloon, do they fly that  fast and at night?  Do they routinely fly one after ano! ther, this was not going up, it was flying across the night sk! y, and I ’m sorry I never documented exactly when it did happen, I just know it was about 5 or 6 months ago…..would love some opinions.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.

Was shaped like a gray saucer  I moved quickly  as to chase it then it moved toward me.  It was coming so fast that I turned back grabbed my son and shot toward a house then as I looked back  it retreated.  UFO was so silent that it could have been inches above our head and we would not have not known it was there without looking up.   As it floated away it used remarkable movement and agility as it missed all the power lines and trees; then just floated over a house.   Just me and my son were out very cold night everything was quite but in a populated housing area.  I never believed in UFO&#39;s but now I just have to wonder what this object was.

I think I am good at calculating speed.  I followed its path for as long as 20 or 30 seconds.  It was so amazing for me that I cried out my daughter, ((name deleted)) who is ((teenager)) to join me and watch what I was.  After giving the exact direction of that UFO, she started shouting and called my other girl who is 10 and had problems in watching the same.

Immediately after sitting down I began meditating.  I visualized in my mind my exact location.  First I began far out in space looking at the entire United States, and then I moved into Oregon, then to the Coast, then to the Bandon area.  After that I repeatedly drew my zipcode in my mind.  Then, in my mind still, I traced the roads that lead to my property.  When I had finished giving this mental beacon I watched the sky.  At approx. 6:45 pm I witnessed white lights dancing on the horizon.  Each time they made a sudden flash or sharp turn I would hold my lighter up and flash back.  Soon they were coming closer to me.  When they passed behind a cloud nearly above my head I did not see them for 10 seconds or so.  I looked back at the horizon to see if they had retreated there and when I looked back up in the sky above my head I saw a blazing orange trapezoid (sides longer than top ! and bottom) appear approx. 300 ft. up just inside the bottom of the cloud layer.  It&#39;s size was equal to a baseball at arms length.  It got very bright and slowly dissipated.  I had not been frightened when I saw them at a distance on the horizon, but once it was right above my head I became very frightened.  Just as the trapezoid vanished another light with the same color appeared in the trees on the property adjacent to ours.  I knew there were no lights conventional lights where this light had manifested.  The orange light flashed 5 or 6 times.  At this point I was too afraid to continue with the experience.  Later, I kicked myself for not investigating.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.  PD))<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((ADDENDUM FROM ANONYMOUS SOURCE))<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is an adjunct to my sighting report of January 21st, 2010.  As reported, I witnessed a fire orange trapezoid shape illumined in the sky approx. 300 ft. above my head and 30-40 ft. in front of me following an observation of three white lights dancing on the horizon.  Just as the trapezoid disappeared a light of the same color lit up a patch of forest on an adjacent property where I knew there should not be any source of light.  Obviously this was quite shocking for me.  The next day I walked up to the same spot I had been standing the previous night.  I was questioning my sighting and sanity because it was just too vivid and close.  It is one thing to see lights dancing around far off in the atmosphere, but it is quite another experience to have something happen directly over your head at a close distance.  So I went up there again to see if I could see anything else in the daytime.  I watched the sky where the trapezoid had appeared for five minutes or so and decided that I would go back to the house.  When my eyes retreated from the sky and came down to Earth I saw something very strange on the ground directly below the spot where I had seen the trapezoid.  I approached the strange spot on the ground.  It was the body of my dog that went missing approx. 2 months previous.  I was shaken when I put all the events of the past 24 hours together.  It is my feeling that this is not at all a case of animal mutilation, rather, it is my strong conviction that I was led to the spot for a sign of intent on behalf of whatever force was controlling the lights in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

I went outside; sky was clear with stars, cold and dry.  I saw the craft making the sound; it moved in a jet-like fashion and had several red lights only around its front.  As it came from the east, it circled over my house then proceeded easterly again; as it did the lights flashed to all white, then back to all red non blinking.  I could only guess at the full shape of the craft, which appeared chevron-shaped.  It headed east over the town of Narragansett and I could still hear its roar.  I also saw a small white circular light accompanying the craft for a brief time as it headed east.  The craft then veered away from the paralleling white orb.  I then called the South Kingstown police.  A dispatcher/policeman took my call seriously and said I was the second caller to this phenomenon.  He had no explanation. The rest of the evening was! quiet.  I did not call my neighbor as I didn&#39;t want to alarm his kids.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

We live within a 30 mile distance of an airport and see the aircraft flying over in a landing pattern nightly.  This was different.  It sounded as if the craft was going to land on the house.  I went outside to investigate.  Out back I saw something that was not like anything I had seen before; it almost looked like it was taking cover in the clouds overhead.  The lights were very bright and moved in a pattern that a regular aircraft does not usually follow.  The second time we heard the noise it shook the whole house.  I went out the front door this time and again saw the bright lights they were flying east bound and then simply like putting a car in reverse headed back west bound.  As it came closer I could not only hear the rumble of the craft, but I could feel the sound.  My son being very scared again asked me to come in, and!  I did.  I went back out a few minutes later and there was nothing.<n>

What I can&#39;t explain truthfully was why it had a strange eerie glow emanating from it.  The green white colors and comet like tail was the most profound thing I have ever seen on this planet.  It couldn&#39;t have been a missile test.  Rockets don&#39;t make strange colors like that and it appeared so beautiful like I had died and seen an angel.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Before I talk more I&#39;d like to explain to the reader who I am.  I am 28 now this occurred 2 years ago.  I have been diagnosed by a medical doctor with no phychological problems except a mild form of ptsd from the past.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What I saw was witnessed by another older man in his 40s.  We were both on the same road driving on highway 1 from santa monica to oxnard , right around mugu rock all of a sudden my vehicle shut down completely , no lights no engine slowly stalled to a stop on the pullout.  The man in his dodge charger in front of me stopped too about 30 yds ahead.  These were the only vehicles on the road that night me and him.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Okay so when I got out to investigate the disturbance I got the weird feeling and looking over the ocean and the other man looking to saw the object, it was so amazing I could not believe what I was seeing all my years in college I could not explain in physics how the object moved with no noise at all.  I thought I was seeing something paranormal but I don&#39;t believe in ghosts so scratch that thought.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object moved so slow and it went back towards the horizon but at first it was close then as it disappeared the cars miraculously started up.  I never believed in ufos before now I&#39;m definitely a believer.  I thought I was witnessing a miracle but nothing really happened it appeared and that was it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;m sorry I did not have a cam phone to record it at the time all I can say are words.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was coming from lax airport at the time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object looked like aurora borealis is all I could come up with.<n>

Evening dark sky partly cloudy. One witness was at his work walking his normal route. As he walked outside of the building he was in. He looked around at his surroundings and a very bright red light in the sky caught his attention. He looked to the south eastern sky and saw a group of red lights. They were blinking or turning on and off. It seemed to be in a pattern then turned randomly and one small white light in the middle of them all on for the duration of the sighting. It was slow moving to the north west from the south west. The witness looked at the lights and could not make of it any conventionally known craft other than experimental. The planes that usually fly by have red, white and green lights that are flashing or blinking in a sequence. These did not match of those seen normally. And military aircraft run infrared or red and green lights. At about 21:09, the witness took some video and pictures with his cell phone but are useless due to th! e poor technology in cell phone cameras. The red lights were traveling north west to the San Gabriel Mountains near Azusa, CA when it makes an abrupt turn north. And goes north over the mountains and seems to be exactly leveled with the peaks of the mountains which are around 6,000 ft. And was not seen again at about 21:11 hours.<n> <n><n> <n><n> No body or fuselage could be clearly seen with the red lights. The red lights all seemed to be attached to something other than being in formation separately. One white light in the middle of the other lights that seem to be on at all times but very dim. The red lights seen were 2-3 red lights at front of the group of lights, 2-3 on the sides of it and 2-3 at the rear. The witness thinks the object was a triangle shape due to the position of the lights. The altitude would be an approximate of 7-15,000 ft. No sound was herd from the lights. Nothing else unusual was seen that night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The witness is has seen many commercial aircraft in the area before and is knows what to look for in normal characteristics. This sighting could be an experimental conventional military aircraft of sorts but it was unidentified flying object that could possibly be the real thing.<n>

It came straight down and looked like it touched the ground and then disappeared. No noise could be heard...nothing...it appeared out of no where and disappeared as quickly as it appeared. About 21:00 I went out to look and see if there was anything in the sky or in the pasture as our outside dogs were barking. I noticed off in the distance what appeared as some sort of a sparkling blueish-green, yellow, red shape hovering over our town. I called my daughter and we both stood there in the window watching the almost star like looking object (same color my daughter reported seeing) flicker in color as if the colors were going around the shape and twinkling. It was very noticeable to the naked eye that they were colors and what ever it was was stationary. Over to the right and out and up from our past! ure in the sky was a amber/redish looking glowing object as well. This one did not flicker or change colors. It remained a redish glow. Both objects are above our town...not as far out as a star....but distinguishable with the naked eye. Not really sure what it could be other than a UFO possibly. I would love to know if anyone else reported it.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was moving very slowly in a straight-ahead direction, straight across the sky.  Then, all the sudden, it shot down at I’d say a 75-80% angle and the lights grew much more intense as it fell to the earth.  It looked like a bow tie shape where the inside had a straight, large black line and on both sides was a triangle of bright light.  The triangle was fuzzy on the sides and looked “jagged” on the outside edge, almost like sunrays.  It shot down past the top of the trees, and I could no longer see it.  It left behind a small smoke trail.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.  PD))<n>

The &#34;UFO&#34; was triangular in shape with somewhere between 40-60 lights on the underside of it all with the same brightness and standard yellowish color. I stopped on the side of the road, got out of the car and starred at the object for at least a minute, watching it hover around over the tree tops. I tried as hard as possible to absorb as much info as I could about this object because it would be so hard to tell someone what I saw later on. I was able to conclude that if it was on the ground it would have been about 10-15ft across with about 50 lights tightly packed together taking up the entire area of the underside of the object. The lights stayed on as rows consecutively turned off and then back on as th! e next row did. After about 15 seconds some of the lights turned off to create an arrow shape on the underside of the object with the rows turning on and off the same way; the arrow was pointing in the direction it was moving. The object made no sound whatsoever and made erratic movements back and forth on either side of the road going only a few miles per hour as if the wind was pushing it along back and forth. After staring at it for a minute the object started going down the street in the direction I was heading. I immediately got back into the car and started chasing after it. I never lost sight of it while chasing it and it started going faster than I could keep up with it. I looked at the speedometer and I was going in excess of 60 MPH and still accelerating for another quarter mile until the road came to an intersection where the road i was on ended and the object continued straight in the direction it was going over the tree line due east. I could not get a photo be! cause it was dark and the quality of my camera phone was poor.! The wea ther was clear and it was at 7:00 pm so it was dark. About my self, I have never believed in UFO&#39;s and I never had an interest in it before in fact I would laugh about it when people on tv claimed they saw something. I was going from my house to my job as a firefighter so there was no drug/alcohol involved. I am currently a college student. This is the first time I have ever seen something like this and have done research to see if this was a military object and could not find anything close to what I saw except for other similar triangular UFO&#39;s but they usually only have three lights as opposed to my blinking 50 or so lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I immediately saw a silver reflection in the sky to my left over a huge bare-ground field.  I noticed it immediately because the sun was to my right, and had a sharp shine on the object up in the sky to my left. It was very clear to see.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object was at least 2,000 - 3,000 feet up, traveling very slowly back the opposite direction from me.

The object was very long, silver, and shaped like the typical cigar shape other people report, and was incredibly shiny from the sun reflecting off it&#39;s body.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I pulled over onto the side of the road and watched it slowly move on at about 20 - 30 miles an hour, estimated.  I never saw any wings. I never saw any smoke or exhaust trail either.  I had my window rolled down and no noise at all from the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Could it have been a plane? Maybe...but I didn&#39;t see any wings.  Any planes usually leave exhaust trails as well as noise.

First he saw &#34;something&#34; and said - &#34;...what&#39;s that thing floating/flying out there?&#34;  I looked out the window - and didn&#39;t see anything - noting that we were close to the Las Vegas airport and just figured it was a helicopter or small plane.  About 5 minutes later I happened to look out the window and noticed a glowing &#34;ball&#34; of light and went closer to the window to get a better view.  As I focused on the glowing ball - I realized it was really a ring, glowing and it floated down past our window then actually floated across the hotel and disappeared.  I am not sure of the size, or even the distance - but if seemed to be around 8&#34; in diameter and floating just a couple feet outside the window.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

We were running through the trails i shoveled through the snow.  My daughter loves to point at the moon and the stars ever so often. So before we went inside to get out the cold i said to her &#34;say goodbye to the moon and the stars.&#34; I panned the sky and to the north over Lake Superior i saw a bright light. Twice as bright as the ever is on its brightest night. It was moving from west to east. At first i thought it was a satalite. But i realized it was much to bright. My mind was racing trying to figure out what could be so bright in the sky. Im absolutley sure it was not a plane. It made no noise had no flashing lights and was way to bright. Its was not a meteor, There was no tail and the object moved in a straight line perfect to the horizon. The light began to fade. I thought it was going behind clouds. But the sky was clear and i could see stars all around the area of the object. And not a could anywhere i! n the sky! It faded fairly quickly until it was just gone. I brought my daughter quickly inside. Handed her off to her mother and went right back out to watch for more. In a matter of three minutes i was back outside scanning the north horizon when i saw a jet flying the exact same path. I could see the flashing lights of the jet and hear the roar of the engines. I stayed outside for another 20 minutes and saw one satalite. The satalite was much dimmer and much slower than the object i saw. I have no blurry pics, no shaky cell phone cam and my only witness is my year and a half daughter. But i saw it. And it was cool. I am puzzled. Excited. Curious. Just dont know what it was. I guess thats why there called UFO&#39;s.<n>

The cabin is in a tiny town located in the Mt Baker Snoqualmie National Forest (outside the town of Granite Falls) in the western cascade mountains of Washington. The lights were very bright and were shining through my window at an angle that would indicate it was coming from the sky and lit up the second floor deck. I got up and went to the window and looked outside and then realized that the entire cabin was being lit up by some kind of a giant spot light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is very strange as this area is very remote and there is no electricity. The other strange thing is that there was no noise at all, as I first assumed that the lights were coming from a helicopter or plane I listened to see if I could hear anything and I could only hear the creek running outside.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I can quickly dismiss the lights coming from a helicopter, plane, or any type of nearby machinery because of the remote location of my cabin in this little town. The lights disappeared just after I got up to look out the window. When I got up, the first thing I thought about was that there was a search helicopter hovering around, but as I said there was no noise or rumbling at all. The light on the cabin was very large and bright and was not wavering around, it was very still.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

It just barely cleared some palm trees in my complex, maybe 40 feet tall.  It didn’t look anything like a bird it looked more like a toy plane, and the only bird I have seen this big was a seagull.

This peaked my interest and I went outside to check, but saw nothing. I returned inside and a few minutes later, the infrared cameras picked it up again.  I then inspected the perimeter of the building and searched up and down the adjacent streets; it was then that I noticed a bright red object to the NorthWest of my location.  It was above the cloud deck and was not a planet. Note that Mars was on the Solar Planar and visible to the East and other planets were obscured by cloud coverage.  I hopped in my truck and felt compelled to investigate this object.  As I headed around my block and onto Hill Rd.  I continued to keep an eye on the object, which was descending and/or getting brighter.  Having seen MANY objects similar to this one over the past 9 months, I was very calm and prepared for almost anything.   But this was different.  I traveled no further than 8 blocks and traveled up a dead end street to the north.  All lights in the neighborhood dimmed, my truck lost power, and I was mesmerized as this Red Light became a shape. It descended even closer to me and literally came to within 100 Meters from my vehicle.  I pulled out my cell phone and began filming it.  The video details far more than what I saw... I saw a Red Craft maneuver from at least 15K feet altitude to 100 meters in front of me in 3-5 seconds!  I found myself face to face with something that looked like it had retro-rockets on it, and then an EXTREMELY bright light that it shined into my face, causing nausea, mild confusion and a severe headache.  I&#39;ve seen at least 100 unexplained objects in my life, but based upon my background, training and desire to not jump to conclusions, I&#39;ve never reported one before.  This one is different.  It sent a message.  I feel ill right now and have what appear to be radiation burns on my fingers and symptoms of radiation sickness. The video when viewed  frame by frame, along with my narration, details a few seconds when the craft seemed to generate a &#34;plasma-like Orb&#34; and then swirled it around and shot a beam at me. Close analysis by my Dad and I found at the same moment, the glass of my vehicle warped, and I stopped talking, lost my bearing and then regained focus again. It wasn&#39;t so much that the object seemed malevolent, but rather that it was aware of my presence and allowing me to film it, yet at the same time, it felt like it was telling me to leave.<n> <n><n> <n><n> OBSERVER BACKGROUND: Observer is a 41 year old College Educated Computer Engineer with 16 years experience, as well as P.O.S.T.

I live on Malmstrom AFB and on a Sunday night, we don‘t normally have any air traffic and there are no active runways in this general area.  The lights were very low, just above the houses a few blocks away and almost looked like gigantic auto headlights.  It was coming from the South. I was surprised to see a plane flying so slowly and low in the area, but then it dawned on me that I’ve never seen a plane like that.   For a moment, I thought it might be a helo, but it was too large and didn’t move like a helicopter.  It was about the size of 3 average-sized houses.  It also had a blinking red light somewhere just above or below the 2 “headlights”.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I stood and watched the craft and it very slowly banked SWest and as it turned, I saw 8 (I think) bright white/yellow lights shining from the underside in a triangular pattern.  It was completely silent and very slow and the lights seemed to be a bit hazy, possibly from the debris caught in the wind. It disappeared from my view as it moved away.  We also had a major temperature change today (it went from below zero F to about 60 F in a matter of hours- it happens in MT quite a bit)  Just before I saw the craft, the wind was so intense that I had to brace myself on my vehicle.  About 10 minutes after I saw the craft leave, the wind died down significantly.   I’ve worked and lived around aircraft for over 15 years and have never seen anything like this.<n>

I looked up in the northwestern sky and saw a very large rectangular object that seemed to be about 1000 feet up.It was about 100Ft. long by about 75 Ft. wide. It had four light orange lights, one on each corner with a solid beam. It was moving to the southeast at a moderate rate of speed. I would say a little faster than a jetliner. We could hear no noise at all, which we both found very strange.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I ran in to get my camera but by the time I came out (about 15 seconds) it was to far away to capture on film.

They were flying in swooping and rapid movements.  I was trying to figure out what it was and finally woke my husband, and said, ‘Hey, I think it is a UFO.’   I then concentrated on driving while he watched.  This is what he saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I saw the same three lights and immediately they changed directions away from us, very low to the ground and the 3 morphed into 2 lights changing colors and disappeared out of sight.  I am not sure, if it totally disappeared or if it was hidden by the small hillsides as we traveled away.<n>

The disk was flying low and emitted no noise. the object had a continous small red light on top of it. The object was moving slow and i lost it in the trees. My wife sketched what she saw the next morning and what she sketched was a picture of saucer which you see in the movies. We were very confused and mesmerized by this event.

Reminded me of a cluster of balloons - my daughter thought it looked like a jellyfish - it definitely pulsated and glowed as bright as the stars in our view.  It originated at about the same level as where the jets fly in over our apartment.  The airport is about 10 miles from here.  It continued to glow and pulsate at a constant rate and finally left our view in a South-Eastern direction until it was out of our sight. Unfortunately, the only camera I have is my cell phone and I was unable to capture it on film.<n>

I was driving out of a town called Stourport and entering countryside with very little street lighting. Out of the right hand corner of my field of vision I noticed a circular illuminated object, consisting of a whitish-orange center with a deeper orange-red outer ring traveling right to left in front of my direction of travel. I would guess the object diameter to be approximately 20 feet and my distance to the object about 100 yards. The object was describing an arc, no more than about 60 feet off the ground and traveling at fast-jet speed, say 200 to 300 mph. When almost directly over the road on which I was traveling it did a total 90 degree turn in an instant, or on a sixpence as we say over here, so that it was now progressing in the same direction as myself. It disappeared over the trees and I was hoping to catch sight of it around the next bend but ! it was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This whole episode was over in seconds and my first reaction was &#34;Wow, I&#39;ve never seen aircraft navigation lights like that before!&#34; Then the realisation of what I had seen started to sink in. A fast jet could not have made that maneuver, and it was too fast to be a helicopter. Also, whilst still thinking about it a few days later I realised that the object light had a strange quality about it, similar I would say to a speckle pattern effect that you get when shining a laser onto a surface.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;m a qualified accountant,(CPA equivalent), and I&#39;ve been an aviation enthusiast all my life. My aircraft recognition skills are very good but needless to say I&#39;ve never seen anything like this before.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

I looked up but could not see whatever was making the noise because of low clouds.  It sounded kind of like a car alarm but a lower pitch.  The noise was cycling and constant as it passed overhead and to the south.  Minutes after, I heard a helicopter pass overhead, then two more off in the distance to the east and a finally fourth coming from the north.  They formed up in a line abreast and began what seemed like a &#34;sweep&#34; in a northwest direction and turned southeast.  They are probably visible in the sky as I type this.  The helicopters have to be related to what I heard.  The only other time I saw so many helicopters was durning coverage of OJ Simpson in the Ford Bronco speeding down the 91 fwy.  They were media copters getting the scoop. Going to check the TV and see if there is a car chase or something.<n>

We were delivering phone books. As I was carrying my share of books, I looked up and saw a light moving farely fast over head. The light was very high. I thought at first it was a sattalite. But it was moving too fast. I pointed it out to one of the other drivers and her girl. The driver, just shrugged. The girl looked for a couple seconds, and walked away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The only reason I am suspisious about this, is that I had seen these kinds of lights before. About a week later, I was locking our chickens up, and looked up, and there were the same lights. They moved the same pace that&#39;s for sure. (I know I have seen too many alien movies in my childhood.) I went to our barn and shut the door. I waited some time, then stepped out. The lights were almost out of  sight. Then I watched them stop, and desend into the sky. I mean it just got smaller and smaller. it did not move. It just got smaller. Weird. I think I saw them another time too, but I was not paying attention. Too bad.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have seen MANY weird things. These are some of them.

I heard an airplane that was particularly loud, so I looked up. I saw at first what appeared to be a single, sphere shaped craft that looked to be trailing the airplane.  It was &#34;silver&#34; in color when I first spotted it. As i followed the sphere trailing the airplane, it suddenly stopped. I mean it just stopped moving and was perfectly still. I couldn&#39;t believe my eyes.  Suddenly, the sphere began to turn baby blue as if it were reflecting the sky.  It wasn&#39;t an immediate change at first, but more like an exotic lizard--it didn&#39;t take more than a few seconds. Subsequently, it then changed from blue to the most amazing green that would describe as emerald, then red. When changing colors it gave the appearance that the craft was &#34;wobbling&#34; as the craft would begin the color change at one end of the sphere and it would make its way to the other side. The best way i c! an describe it alternately is like a modern lighthouse that moves its light beam in a circular motion parallel to the ground, almost like an old fashioned police car siren. I was pretty much just standing in the middle of the street completely mesmerized.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About 2 minutes into this I see another sphere that shot by the stationary sphere at incredible speed. I then moved my focus to the new object. It was identical to the first. In order to keep up with it I was pretty much just spinning in circles. I then see another sphere catch up with the fast moving one (#2). They flew in tandem for a few minutes or so and then suddenly reduced their respective speeds to half that of a conventional aircraft and it was at this point that I noticed the silver appearance began to fade as the crafts began to oscillate and change color, still adhering to their formation. Very spooky. In all I believe that I saw 4-5 spheres--but given their intermittent high speed and hovering behavior, it is hard to say precisely how many there were in the air at that time. Definitely at least 3 as at one point there were 3 craft in my field of vision. The funny thing about all of this is that during this whole experience there were still airplanes that were fl! ying either to or from the airport nearby. The craft just seemed to effortlessly avoid the airplanes and at times they appeared to be chasing them, only to turn around and shoot off in another direction. The whole event lasted approximately 20 minutes as one by one the spheres just seemed to disappear. They didn&#39;t fly off into the horizon but just kind of vanished instead. This is the second UFO that I have seen...both sightings within 2 years of each other. Both were here in North Carolina, one in Greensboro and the previous one in Snow Camp, North Carolina which is about a 45 minute drive from Greensboro.<n>

I&#39;d noticed a very bright white light low in the western night sky .  At first ,  I&#39;d thought it was just a jet .  But with my mini binocular i just happen to have in the pocket of my fleece pullover .  I soon seen ,  it was no jet plane .  This craft was circular in shape .  Perhaps 30-40 ft. around with a Garnet Red luminous ring from top to bottom around the craft .  It looked to be part of the craft which was heading my way .  Just then i&#39;d called out to a friend of my .  Who was inside my house to come check this out .  As he stepped out to see what was up ,   I just handed him my mini binocular&#39;s and said ,  &amp;quot; check it out &amp;quot; .  We both got a good close look at the craft heading from west to east .  As we stood watching ......  the craft began to slow then stopped .  A plume of smoke cloa! ked the craft ......  perhaps ,  so was not too see it ?   Once the craft began to moving eastward for a moment ,  then stopped again .   Once again it cloaked itself w/ a plume of smoke .  Both time&#39;s the plume of smoke  was the same shape as the craft itself .  As we stood passing the binoculars back and forth trying to determine just what is we&#39;re looking at .  The craft began to move  ( actually float )  passing right thru the plume of smoke that cloaked east bound .   It didn&#39;t get far ......  before it made a sharp righthand .  Still floating and now heading south ........  Vanished .  And was gone ,  only the star&#39;s in the clear cold nightsky were visible .  Where the craft had just been .   But the strangest thing other the craft itself .  Was those 2-plume&#39;s of what I thought to be smoke .  They both began stretching out first flat and then apart .  To the point of a fine Cat Whisker .  I can&#39;t quite recall ever seeing smoke as I know it .  Act in this manner .....! ..  I know what is wasn&#39;t that cold January night ......  I sa! w .

I was looking at the stars when I see a light in the sky. There were no other stars around it. It looked so weird, I didn&#39;t take my eyes off it. Then I see 4 lights flash off the side, in a straight line. I was amazed. I looked around to tell my friend. He came over and looked up. The look on his face went to confused, to scared. He walked inside saying it&#39;s too much for him. I didn&#39;t move at all. I wanted to see exactly what it would do. 5 minutes passed. The lights continued to flash. Then, it started to spin. I started walking a little closer, but then at the corner of my eye i see another light. I look closely at it. Then a craft came out of nowhere and slowly hovered almost above me. Almost as if they were watching me. Then it got to the end of our fence. This craft was floating above the house, it caused our lights to flicker. As soon as it got above our house, it went blurry and just disapeared above our house. It vanish! ed, it didnt move it just disapeared. My friend comes outside and he sits down on the chair. He was talking to his girlfriend acting as if nothing happened. He didn&#39;t see what I just saw. I turn to him and start walking toward him. All I said was Joey, then passed out on his porch. I woke up in his room in the chair.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Every night since that night I hear things above my house. Around one to four. One night i actually saw lights flash through my window. I never sleep anymore. Im terrified of what i saw. Its been 2 months. I continue to hear hovering every night. I thought it was my fridge, but when i unplugged it and went upstairs, it got louder. I didn&#39;t want to see what i saw. And I know how most people want to see one so bad, but believe me, you don&#39;t want to encounter one. I never sleep, knowing I&#39;m being watched and in fear that something might come in.

Southwest of my location in Carlsbad, I spotted a bright blue light in the sky.  Following it, the light would turn blue as it flew to my left and then it would turn red as it flew back towards the right.  It circled in the same exact spot in the sky that I&#39;ve seen it before.  The light also hovered, dipped, and shot up into the air, behaving much like a toy helicopter.  Once again, though, from this distance, someone must have put a ton of lights on it, if that&#39;s what it is.  The lights seem brighter than a normal aircraft&#39;s lights would be from the same distance.  It&#39;s seen south and fairly close to Palomar Airport, which is my concern.  In this third sighting, I contacted the local PD for the second time.  I did not report it to the local PD the first time I saw it, but I have for the second and third sightings.  I still believe that someone may be flying something that&#39;s either a remote control plane, helicopter, or a! toy UFO out of a neighborhood park near Poinsettia Ln and Ambrosia Rd.  I will get video if this continues.  It seems to disappear by slowly circling down towards the ground as it gradually drops out of view.  That&#39;s the main reason I believe this is coming out of a local park and not an actual aircraft flying out over the ocean. I may have the distance wrong, however, and someone may be flying this from the beach. The officer I spoke with told me that I was the only one that called it in tonight, so that&#39;s why I believe it must be closer than Interstate 5 and the coast.<n>

That&#39;s when the big jet flew over, and I ran out of the house to look at it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I came back in, I sat down with my wife and we worked together to describe what happened.  We kept talking to each other about the details, trying to explain what we saw, and we couldn&#39;t explain it, only talk about it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;ll let my wife type now!  Thanks!<n> <n><n> <n><n> Report from wife:  First of all, let me preface this by saying I never thought I&#39;d be saying or seeing anything like this, but I did, along with my husband, and we feel we should tell someone who won&#39;t think we&#39;ve gone off the deep end!   LOL<n> <n><n> <n><n> You may share our story if you want to, but we would strongly ask to remain anonymous.  We could accurately be portrayed as a middle-aged (ugh! LOL) married couple in Modesto.  My husband is a professional whose name is recognizable to those in his field, and I hope you understand and respect our need to remain anonymous to anyone other than yourself.<n> <n><n> <n><n> That being said, here&#39;s what happened:  (pasted here from what I wrote directly after seeing whatever it was we saw.  My husband and I &#34;compared notes&#34; as I typed, and are in agreement with everything detailed in the following account.)  Jan 13, 2010 approx. 11:20 pm PST, in Modesto, CA, my husband and I were in our backyard to take the dog out for the night.   The sky was very clear, and we were looking at the stars while waiting for the dog to &#34;go potty.&#34;   My husband suddenly said, &#34;Look!  What IS that?&#34; and pointed up, towards the NW sky, but somewhat overhead.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was something flying very steadily, at a moderate speed - hard to say exactly how fast, not knowing how high the object really was, or how large it may have been, given unknown altitude.  But, we had the impression it was somewhat low-flying, and fairly large in size.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was completely silent.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So much so, it was almost dream-like in a way.  It just didn’t “compute” that something could be doing that and not make a sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was definitely not a balloon, moving too evenly and directly.  No &#34;wobble&#34; or any variance in its trajectory or speed - very smooth, perfectly straight line, perfectly consistent speed.  It flew directly over us on its path.  I have no doubt whatsoever it was moving of its own power.  And this is hard to explain, but it was as if it was maintaining its level, speed and smoothness with no effort - as if gravity, air resistance or any of our conventional laws of physics were not an issue, if that makes any sense.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There were no definite lights, however the entire object was dimly luminous.  It was certainly the source of the light itself, it was not a reflection or a beam of light.  Nor did it project any illumination or beam of light.  It just was kind of phosphorescent.  There were no visible markings at all.  It was not really bright, but sort of similar to how a light looks when turned low on a dimmer switch, or even less.  It didn&#39;t have finely exact definite edges - it was dim enough to appear somewhat diffuse, though the shape was completely discernable, and incomparable to anything known.   And it was definitely a solid object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The shape is difficult to describe - somewhat diamond gem shaped, but more rounded, sort of like a horseshoe crab shape without the tail.  We both had the impression we were looking at the bottom of the object without being able to see the sides.  The same perspective one would have if they held a plate or bowl overhead and could only see the bottom.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object continued on an absolutely straight path, traveling SE, and eventually we lost sight of it, after about 30 or 40 seconds from initially sighting it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What&#39;s strange, now that I consider it, is that it did not change in dimension, in other words, as it got further away, it didn&#39;t necessarily get commensurately smaller as one would expect from normal perspective, yet we both perceived it getting further away.  Very hard to explain.  But, it was as if it finally went out of sight more as a result of not being able to see its luminosity from that distance anymore, as opposed to it getting smaller and smaller.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Oddly, I feel as if its shape did not change commensurately either, the further away it got, it did not appear to become more elliptical, as one would expect something of that shape to do in normal circumstances.  Nor did we perceive seeing “sides” or a “top” to it as one may expect.  Yet, somehow, we knew it was not paper-thin, we knew we were seeing the bottom of an object of undeterminable overall multiple dimensions.  Very, very difficult to explain adequately.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Although my husband kept asking me, “What is it?” and I kept answering, “I don’t know!” we were both calm during the &#34;event&#34; - no feeling of fear or panic, more so a feeling of wondering or awe.  My husband felt it was a feeling of excitement, I felt strangely calm, but in wonderment.  It is only now, after the fact, that we are somewhat agitated, a little fearful I guess, and somewhat bewildered.  Like our logical minds are seeking an explanation.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Something else odd – an estimated 8 to 10 minutes after our experience, a huge jet, definitely not a commercial passenger jet, flew over really low and fast, and was very, very loud.  We NEVER have anything like this in our area – only small planes, little commuter jets upon occasion, or commercial jets flying really high.  This thing sounded like a rocket or fighter jet, and was flying really low.  We had just come in the house, and upon hearing how loud this jet was, my husband ran back outside to see it.  He said that it went south, and then abruptly circled easterly, and then turned SE, and continued in the very direction we saw the object fly.  We just thought that was weird, especially considering what we had just seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So – that’s the story!   As fantastic as it sounds, I know what we saw, and have absolutely no idea what it was, and absolutely no doubt it was NOT anything conventional possibilities can explain.  It was like nothing I’ve ever seen in my life.<n>

There were a series of thee lights, bright yellowish in color in the center, two lights on each side above the series of three center lights, and a glowing rounded bottom.  I was in my car leaving work when I noticed it out of the corner of my eye.  It was shocking because I knew it was unlike anything I had ever seen before. I kept yelling out loud &#34;what the hell is that&#34;, then as I pulled out of my parking spot into the street the object was slightly hidden by a tree, so I reversed my car as to get a better look and within a blink of an eye it was completely gone.<n>

I have a report on a recent sighting that should match up with other reports in the area.  I&#39;m confident at least 50-100 people would have seen the same thing, to include my neighbor as a witness.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Taking out the trash at approx 5:40pm Jan 13, 2010..  looking north from &#34;midway&#34; towards Escambia Bay, I saw a bright white/orange-tinted ( about -6 magnitude brightness ) spherical light-form traveling East from Garson Point Bridge towards Eglin AFB&#39;s West boundary at a rate of approx 500knts.  As it approached the middle of the bay, about 3-4 seconds since I noticed the object, it made a downward 180 degree turn at the same rate of speed.  I dropped the garbage bag in the driveway, and knew that what I was seeing was not anything in our publicly known aviation inventory. My view was obscured from about 15 degrees from the horizon to the top of the tree line to my North. The object would dive below and above the trees moving in a very similar pattern as a dragonfly. After approx. 2 minutes of viewing I was able to signal my neighbor to be a witness.. after about a minute or two the object shot skyward from it&#39;s last position below the tree line as if it were staying in ! a particular piece of airspace in the middle of the bay, approx 1/2 mile wide and below 4000ft.  I should also mention there was a thin cloud layer around 5000ft which helped me judge the distance and scale of the light sphere.  At times the object would traverse and incredible speeds, well in excess of mach2-3 without breaking the sound barrier and without making any audible sound from approx 1mi away.  Traffic from Hwy98 was audible as well as several single engine recreational aircraft off in the distance, west and south of the activity, approx 8-15 miles. The last maneuver the object made was from west to east it climbed to approx 4000ft, turned north, “zig-zagged” in an S pattern and vanished after the 3rd “zag”, not to be seen again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Shortly after a single rotor helicopter came on site ( pursuit ) from west to east along the original path of the sphere, and turned north toward Whiting Field NAS.  No other aircraft approached the area except for a commercial flight leaving PNS traveling North-East, which tells me the airspace was not locked down.  I was under the impression that this object wanted to show-off and be seen.  Also another observation was 3 satellites at 90 degrees elevation, magnitude about +4, intersecting directly above shortly after the sighting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;m still in awe over this observation.  I&#39;m very familiar with military aviation and aeronautical engineering.  This sphere was defying our physics somehow by moving through the atmosphere at those speeds without disturbing the air.  Most Impressive.<n>

(It is not uncommon to see jets in the sky over northeastern West Virginia, but seeing three of them fly so close together and in the same direction is a rarity.) Within minutes, many more similar objects appeared, all with the same general heading, coming from multiple directions (most were coming from the south, and a few were coming from the north). At this time, there were about 10-15 objects in the sky. All of these objects had vapor trails, which is why I assume they were jets, but I began to notice that three or four of the trails were distinctly different from the rest; they had a slight blueish tint, and seemed to flash or flicker. I then noticed that one or two of the objects seemed to be traveling vertically, toward! the ground (albeit at a very high altitude); I didn&#39;t notice when these objects appeared or if they had been traveling west like the others, but I did notice that their trails were curved, as if they had been flying from the west to the south-east, then suddenly and drastically changed their pitch. I lost visual contact shortly after this as I was traveling in a different direction, but the event might have lasted longer.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I believe some of these objects might have been meteorites or debris entering the atmosphere. I am unsure if this event has been reported, but perhaps the nearby North Central West Virginia Airport (CKB) would have some information about the incident.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

For some reason I glanced out the window, and noticed a large bright star and it caught my attention.  It was blinking with different color lights; through a pair of binocs you could hardly look at it, it was so bright.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Well i noticed it moved then stopped. It would hover then move again.  It didn&#39;t seem to have any set direction.  I woke my brother up and he was stunned at what we were watching.  While we were watching my dad heard the commotion, and being a skeptical man, he was dumbfounded at the object.  This object was in the southwest sky.  We couldn&#39;t hear any noise from it.  The object continued this for a couple hours until I went back to sleep.<n> <n><n> <n><n> If anyone could please tell me what this may of been I&#39;d be obliged.  It was quite an alarming thing to watch it hover then move then hover again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Possible sighting of Sirius.  PD))<n>

Each flash of light looked like a small orange fireball and they appeared and disappeared in three distinct spots.  It was almost as if someone had lit something on fire and put it out really quickly and it was too high in the sky to be a firework.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My partner who was driving asked if I had seen what he just did.  I confirmed with him that I did.  We entered the freeway and our view was blocked by trees.

The object was moving at a fast pace, there were airplanes in the sky around that same time and compared to this object they were going very slow. As we were still driving home which is a ten minute drive, we saw the object again but it added three more lights and they were traveling together in a slightly curved shape.

(I don&#39;t want my whole name announced because I realize UFO sightings seem retarded)  I live in Peryy County~eastern Kentucky. Anyhow, last night, January 11th, 2010, me and my brothers were out on my porch smoking (PLAIN, ORDINARY CIGARETTES), when my brother noticed a SQUARE SHAPED object flying above. It was sort of behind a tree so we walked out into the yard to look around the tree and get a better view. When we looked up again from the yard we notice it wasn&#39;t moving and that there were two more across from it that were blocked from our view from the porch.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The three object were in a triangular form and had bright red lights all the way around them.  Only one of them were moving. It was moving away from the other two, but not in the blink of an eye like most people claim.  It moved slow and stopped not to far from where it started from.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This was really freaky.  I went inside and got my wife&#39;s digital camera which has a video recorder built in and took like 3 pictures and a couple videos.  The objects stayed there for about five minutes. We went back inside and got my wife out of bed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We got out a telescope to try to get a closer look at them, but when we got outside they were all gone.  I realize now that a telescope would have been too strong to see anything, but it was all we had handy at the time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is the part where you&#39;re going to call BS, but none of the pictures or videos showed up.<n>

I look and I see a neon blue object  with what it looks like some sort of  haze around it about a hundred yards in the sky.  At first glance I think it is a helicopter about to crash into the ground but I hear no rotors, so I keep watching it . I was going about 40 mph and the object was going about 100 or so. As it is flying in the air it is going at an angle towards the ground and eventually goes below the tree line and I was listening to make sure it really wasn&#39;t a helicopter that had crashed but I heard nothing and the object just disappears . Right after I see this I call my friend who&#39;s house I just left and describe to him everything I just saw . While describing this to my friend our conversation was interrupted by a noise. A noise I never heard before had all of the sudden interupted my call. The! only thing I can really say it sounds like is that sound from a sonar just with a different tone And much much louder . I can honestly say I never heard anything like it before. This experience made me a believer.<n>

We were then looking upwards towards the Eastern sky when 3 dim but distinct white lights forming an equilateral triangle flew overhead at high speed on about an 80 degree Easterly heading.   No outline of a craft was visible.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The lights each had appearances more like that of illuminated rings rather than being solid, and the intensity of each ring was about that of a medium star that is easily observable.   If there had been street or yard lights nearby, they probably would not have been visible.  I definitely feel that they were all on one craft of some sort as they did not vary in distance or orientation to each other at all.  As for the size, the palm of your hand would have covered them all with your arm extended.  The diameter of each ring was approximately 25% of each leg of the triangle.  They had already passed overhead when we spotted them at about 75 degrees above the Eastern! horizon.  I’d estimate that they traveled 30 to 35 degrees of the sky in 3 to 4 seconds before we lost sight behind the trees and roof.  The wind was calm and we heard absolutely no sound.   This craft had just went out of sight, when we spotted a single ring of light of the same magnitude and speed following a parallel path slightly to the south.  It may have been slightly larger than the other rings.  Or lower?   My initial gut feeling was that these lights were traveling at an altitude in excess of 10,000 feet with a speed in the thousands of miles per hour.  I have no way to know what the actual altitude was, but they did not appear to get smaller or less brilliant as they passed, so that indicates to me that they were of significantly high altitude.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What appeared to be an airliner was almost directly overhead shortly after the rings and the lights on it were much brighter and the speed was slower by many many times.  The temperature was 12 degrees and the stars were bright and crisp, so even thought they were dim, the rings of light were very distinct and stayed at the same intensity for the brief time they were visible.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Added 1/27/10:  My date read the above and agreed on everything other than she said she thought the rings were visible at least 4 seconds.   I  feel the speed could have been  15 - 20,000 mph if the airliner speed was 600 MPH.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((ADDENDUM FROM SOURCE OF REPORT))<n> <n><n> <n><n> &#34;4 Rings of light accompanied by 1 ring of light&#34; should have read: 3 Rings of light accompanied by 1 ring of light<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

What was weird about it was very large and was headed in up direction and seem to disappear in the atmosphere.  Lasted about 3 to 6 Seconds.  I was mad because, I just plugged in my cell phone to charge it @ home, and I usually have it with me.  I consider myself an amateur astronomer, I never seen a meteor go in the up direction.  It could have been the direction we saw it. My first thoughts it was a launch from VAFB base,  There is no launches that night.  I’ve seen meteors, comets, satellites, Rocket launches before and this was different.  The size is what amazed me. Anyway cool site. Will always have camera on my night walks now.<n>

But may have seen another red flashing light, which was smaller real close to it as it had slowed or was turning.  Almost as if it came from the object or was a part of the object.

Directly in front of use was an object the kept flashing different colors.  It was at about 30 degrees above the horizon and much larger than any stars. I told my girlfriend that I had seen it before and had watched 3 or 4 times before during 2009 and that I was not sure what it was.  Streams of light would come out the bottom at times it appeared to be 4 of them and they did not go to the ground but stopped a ways below the object.  Then off to the north another object that looked exactly like the one we were watching came in close to the first one and stopped a distance from it, about three or four lengths of the object away.  They stayed there for a few seconds stationary.  Then the second object took off angling up into the sky to the west rapidly getting smaller and smaller and when it was just about out of sight it turned and came back toward us and passed over us a! t a very hig attutide and continued out of sight to the east.  The first object just kept moving on to the west slowly and was almost out of sight when we got home about 5 mins later.  This object is multi-colored and give off beams of light down from it.  It appears to be either round or oval it is hard to determine the exact shape as the colors are very bright and keep changing.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

They are not unusual but I have not seen any flying in formation like this here before. I was on a walk with my girlfriend and we both arrived back at the apt. around 2:00p.m. We were entering the stairwell from the parking lot and I noticed a strange looking large, slow moving object over head. I called it to her attention when we were on the stairs. It was so surreal! No noises, no recognizable shape at first. We both stood in awe and asked each other what it was. It looked as if it were a giant 3 orbed blimp, reddish brown in color. I ran into the apt. and snapped some pictures of it from my balcony. I watched it morph into the familiar classic saucer shape as it flew in a perfectly straight line south to where the helicopters were earlier. It hovered in the exact same spot for about 3 minutes and I took some more pictures of it. It slowly be! gan to lift up from its hover and ascended in a straight, vertical line up high in the sky to a point that it stopped and allowed for a passenger plane to pass by. I took a picture of the plane as it flew by, but the object was not visible for that brief instance. It stuck around for a few more minutes hovering and just like that it vanished. About an hour later, the same 4 black helicopters flew back by in the same area that the object was hovering. I don’t know if there is any significance between the helicopters and the object, but it was very odd.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides little contact information.

I think the lights were white, but the event was so short that I’m really not sure.  They moved across 60 deg of my field of view within less than 2 seconds from the same inclination of the moon to about 10deg lower.  My view was then blocked by a tree so I couldn’t see where they went.  I walked to where I could see behind the tree and the lights were gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The lights were aligned along the axis of movement, but were slightly out of alignment.  I would have thought this to be a jet except that it was moving way too fast and there was no sound at all.

I look in the direction where he pointed just then a second later it was gone.  i have seen lights in the sky and one night i had my lazer pointer an sent a messeage in morse code,this light answer back,then it was gone. the messeage said come on down,their answer was not now,maybe later. since then we have been seeing these light in the sky. on 01/9/2010 at 21:hours we pulled into our drive way I had my high beams on thats when I saw foot prints  going from the garage doors that face the woods all the way back to the end of the woof and just stopped at the window. now I have a garage that will hold six large cars. This garage is at least 60 feet wide and as long. things have been coming to the back porch knocking on the back door,we also have come home and found things moved around in the house. my dog goes crazy barking at something in the backs woods. I have went out in the back yard to get him to stop barking and myself heard something moving around. one night I came home around 2am,parked the car,locked the door and began to walk up the long driveway when I hear something say hi to me. being very dark I walked faster up the driveway and into my house. It was at least 80 degrfees out side ,but i sat there shaking.  this is a non stop going thing,maybe I should not have told then to come<n>

The color and intensity resembled laser light.  It was neither incandescent nor florescent but very bright light like a high intensity LED.  The lights both gave out two small sharp rays of light from the orb’s body at a 45 degree angle towards the ground.  The trail of light  were small but visible. I thought it was someone pointing a laser light into the air but it was very bright and showed no trail from the laser’s origin.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I stared at the two lights for about 30 seconds in shock trying to make out what it could be, initially I thought it was a hovering helicopter or a UAV but they moved way to fast and in different directions for it to be any aircraft I have ever seen.  At one time the blue orb shot straight upwards into a low cloud and then regrouped with the green orb.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I got my video camera but couldn’t get a focus on the objects in time before they disappeared into the horizon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Both orbs are assumed to be at a estimated 5 to 10 thousand feet or more off my line of sight above the horizon.  My estimated of its location is off shore of the Chevron Oil processing plant in West Oahu, about 3 miles north of the Barbers Point Light House.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I can not tell if it was over land or not but seemed to be just off shore.  It was impossible to get a scale size of the objects but that they seemed close to land.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I called my friend who works at the ATC tower in Honolulu Airport but he called back and stated no reports from the tower.  I also contact a friend on the west side of the island but stated that he saw nothing.  The news had no reports as well.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am sure someone else saw it too.  It is possible for someone that was driving West on H1 Freeway towards Makakilo, HI at about 2130 - 2135 hrs.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I hesitated to report this but there is no denying what I saw.<n>

It was seen in peripheral vision at first, and upon looking up, a solitary white/yellow orb of light quickly raced across the sky, curved right, then left, then right again, in an &#34;S&#34; form, before disappearing.  The local airport was nearby, but the object was moving much too quickly to be any kind of commercial aircraft (and had been moving away from the airfield).  If it had been military or an otherwise highly-technical aircraft, there was no sonicboom, nor could an aircraft turn so sharply.  One of the observers was a former US Air Force personnel.<n>

And as soon as i would look they look as if they would travel in an extremely fast speed and disappear.  The last one I seen in September was the one that stayed hovering above my boyfriends house in Santa Fe Springs, CA, the longest.  It must have been around 4 seconds before it took off in a straight horizontal line.  This one didn’t take off as fast at first but then suddenly disappeared. Im pretty sure it was a UFO.

I am in Newark International’s Approach area.  Many planes fly over my house at very low altitudes, while others pass thru the area taking off to other destinations.  I was observing a plane at moderate altitude going into the airport heading east.  At the same time, much further away and off to the left, I saw a white ball of light.  This ball of light was about the brightness of any low star you can see on a night like this.  It moved consistently towards the east until it simply dimmed out of existence.  After the awe of seeing this, I continued to scan the sky from East to West then North.  I saw again another plane very high in the sky traveling west.  Again I saw another ball of light, which brightness measured to a dim star but was moving to the East.  This one I tracked across my horizon (which isn’t much because I lived in the suburbs) and watched it closely to make sure that it wasn’t my equilibrium! .  This ball of light passed constellations until it as well dimmed into the darkness of space.  This is my full account of the incident.  It is currently 1819hrs EST.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The colors ranged from red, blue, green. purple, yellow, white, etc.  It was much larger than any star in the sky and seemed too big to be a planet as well.<n> <n><n> <n><n> One member who was skeptical said &#34;watch a little guy fall from it now&#34; and not even 5 seconds later what looked like a white fiery ball fell down from the object.  Could have been pure coincidence but after that, we were sure it couldn&#39;t have been a star or planet.  We didn&#39;t see it leave the actual object but it appeared about halfway down from the object in the sky, directly underneath it, and headed straight down to the ground.  There was no fading either. There were trees in the way so we couldn&#39;t see it after that point however.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object up in the sky kept pulsating and stayed in one spot. After awhile, we stopped watching.  About an hour after seeing it, it was no longer there.  We checked again the next 2 nights (to prove it most likely was not a star or planet) and never saw it again.<n>

When I came around a slight curve, just before a long straight away, I noticed lights ahead of me and to the right just above the tree line.  The lights were not immensely bright, like a star or a spot light, but more like soft, white lights seen in recessed fixtures, which these looked very similar to.  There were four lights in a straight, horizontal line, with equal distance inbetween each light(approx. 10-15 ft)and seemed to be fixed in relation to one another.  Since there is only an empty pasture in the area the lights were over, it struck me as very odd to see them there.   While attempting to grasp an idea of what type of aircraft would be that low (150-200 ft approx) I was assuming I would see a newly constructed drilling rig in the field with an illuminated light platform.   But as I approached, slowing down to get a better look, I realized the object! seemed to be moving southwest towards my north-northwest approach.  My wife, who was just ahead of me in another vehicle, did not see the lights at all as she passed.  There was a vehicle right behind me on this two lane road,so I couldn&#39;t stop - as I wanted to.  Instead I slowed to a crawl as I reached the spot the lights were hovering or flying by, leaning forward as much as possible to see to my right if I could see a structure attaching the lights.  At the same time I rolled my window down to see if I could hear a jet engine or roto blades as I passed.  The only thing I could hear was my truck engine and the road.  I believe the object passed over me from the passenger side as  I passed the spot I originally saw them at.  I looked back over my right shoulder to see if I could see the back side of the lights and I couldn&#39;t see anything.  I drove into my neighborhood, constantly looking back to see if I could see anything and there was nothing there.  My wife and I grabb! ed a video camera from the house and drove back out minutes la! ter to s ee if we could see anything at all and there was nothing else unusual.  The next day we drove down the same road several times, taking pictures of the area the lights were seen.  By estimating the one stand of trees just in front of the lights, I would guess the lights were just above them at 150-200 ft. above the ground.  The night I saw the lights was very clear, no clouds.  Intercontinental Airport is due east of my house and the local airport is northwest of it. Planes were all around that night, but at about 3500 ft at the lowest.<n>

When they get closer, then i didnt know if they were independent lights or parts of a huge craft.  I couldn count them but were at least 8.  They keep moving and then they just fade.

As we were starting the vehicles, we both caught sight of an object in the air approximately 1 mile away.  We both made reference as to how low the object was, maybe 1-2000 feet in the air.  The trajectory of the object was by no means in the direction of any nearby airports, and was flying in an extremely straight path.  These things in and of themselves are not entirely out of the ordinary.  However, the following statements were mind baffling.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The speed of the aircraft was very slow.  Judging from our vantage point, the object appeared to be moving somewhere in the range of 30-50 mph.  To say that the object was “probably 2 miles up in the air so it appeared to move slower than it was” does not apply here.  If that were the case, then my estimated size of the object would be about 1000 feet wide, as opposed to the large airliner-size that it appeared.  There were 3 lights on the object; one on each of the sides, and one near what would be considered the back.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The final piece of information about the object was that it was completely silent.  On a clear, cold night in January, with little or no wind to affect the sound, almost any plane in the air is audible to some extent. Not this particular object.   Normally with an aircraft at 5 times its height a faint engine roar could still be heard; but totally silent.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We watched the object for a couple of minutes as it slowly made its way off into the distance.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was not until I got home and started looking online did I realize that I very well might have seen a UFO.<n>

It was only visible for a second, but we both saw it at the same time.  Because we were in traffic we were unable to stop to ask if others saw it.  We were unable to come up with any explanations as to what it could be.  Though it just disappeared so fast, we looked for anything that would provide information or an explanation all the way in route to our home.  When passing the Wachusette Reservoir area we were even looking for signs of what we witnessed, but saw nothing.  However, there was an increase of air traffic, including a helicopter as we approached the town of Clinton, MA. on route 110 heading west.  This also seemed to be the direction of how the seen object arched.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The event happened so rapidly that there was no time to take a photograph with a cell phone.  We will be watching the late news on TV tonight in an effort to find out if there were any reports regarding this sighting.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

As I continued to watch the object, it seemed as though it was going way too fast to be a plane crashing.  My second thought was that it was a comet or shooting star.  It had a tail similar a shooting star.  But  I have never seen a shooting star as close to the Earth or appear to crash in the distance like this did.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As the object approached the horizon, The light went from a bright white to a much brighter green flying behind hills in the distance.

This time it was different.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I saw a bright white light coming towards me way above in the clear sky.  As  it came closer,it got brighter.  My family was home, but I was so shocked that I couldn&#39;t speak.  There  was no noise from the craft-there is always a noise from planes and helicopters,not this time.  As it got closer over  head..I saw a half shaped small craft..with a white light in front and 6-7 small red lights in back of it.  I was thrilled,yet amazed at the same time.   I never thought I&#39;d live to see the day when I saw a UFO!!!   After it went over the back of the building,I ran to the front of our condo and it didnt appear,the craft had disappeared !

They were two orange lights and the one that was higher up was brighter. The dim one went out of view and again, I thought it was just an airplane, until the brighter orange ball seemed like it was getting closer. I then figured it was a helicopter (even though I have never seen a helicopter with that didnt have flashign lights and was a halogen orange), but I couldn’t hear it and it eventually landed on either a road or in woods, and then got brighter. I thought it might be a fire since it flickered, but then it got extremely bright (still orange) and came back up and then grew very dim. Then I realized it hadn’t gotten dimmer, it had just moved away from where I was very fast until it disappeared over the horizon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There were also planes flying overhead<n>

I was approaching the intersection of Rt. 32 South and Main Street (right before you enter the village, near the Rite Aid Plaza right before you go up the small hill) when out the window to my left  I saw 3 white lights in a triangle form in the sky.  It appeared that the three lights were attached to some sort of triangular shaped object.  Two of the lights were blinking and were brighter than the third light. The lights were on the 3 points of the triangle. The triangular object was very close to being equilateral and it seemed that there was definitely a slim, black object of some sort in between the three lights.  In terms of size, the craft was about 1 and 1/4 Full Moons in size.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first glance, I thought the object was not moving at all, but as I continued to watch it while driving, I realized it was moving very very slowly eastward. It was difficult to tell how far from the ground it was, but when I first saw it, I thought it was a low-flying plane--it was probably about 1000 feet from the ground.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was about to lose sight of it, so I took a left hoping to see it from a different angle.

I happened to look out my kitchen window that is over the sink, and something caught my attention.  My window faces east, and I&#39;m about 7 miles to the SW of the Marine Corps Air Ground Combat Center.  What was so intriguing about the sky this morning was that there was a bright light, that appeared to be spiraling towards the ground.  If it was to be moving through the sky, it would have been moving an eastern direction, however because of the angle, it looked like the light was making movement towards the ground.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first glance, I thought it was a plane crash or a shooting start, but then before the light hit the horizon, the light froze in place.  The light didn&#39;t emit any type of trail.  The light was a very bright and was blinking the whole time.  What made me think that the light was spiraling was how fast the light moved from right to left.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The light &#34;fell&#34; for about 20-30 seconds before it reached it&#39;s &#34;hover&#34;.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The light then hovered in place for close to 10 seconds.  Following the hover, the light moved quickly to my right, in a southern direction towards Joshua Tree National Park.  The light started to get smaller as it moved south towards the park.  Then, all of a sudden, it disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There were no clouds in the sky.  A few aircraft could be seen flying in the vapor belt, leaving normal contrails.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About half an hour later, I was standing out in my back yard looking at the sky, trying to figure out what I had seen. I remember counting four visible aircraft (I counted four contrails) when a thin, concave, dark metallic object appeared in the sky slightly higher from where the original light have hovered.  If I was to put my had out in front of my face, with my four fingers extended, the shape was about as wide as my four fingers aligned are wide.  It was VERY large compared to the size of the aircraft in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The shape was larger and more pronounced from what I had seen 30 mins earlier, and wasn&#39;t &#34;glowing&#34; at first.

It looked like an oval in the sky with a purple and a green light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It looked like it was circling in the sky. I could see the outline of the figure. It wasn’t very big it looked like the size of a Cessna airplane but round. It moved very fast it lasted about 10 seconds  (I was looking thru my 4 by 3 foot window). I knew it wasn’t a reflection from anything. It also was not a light from outside because almost no lights were on, the only lights that were on were from a stop light but those were not the colors of lights I saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I never saw anything like that before. When I saw it I didn’t think of anything but “UFO”. Thou I don’t have any proof such as pictures or videos I know what I saw and nothing can change that.

I would like to point out these are not the lights I&#39;m referring to as these have been dismissed as a hoax.<n> <n><n> <n><n> That being said, the red lights caused me to notice the sky more than I had been and my husband and I noticed at least a couple dozen stars that flicker, rather than twinkle as a star does. These lights can be either a silvery color, or golden, but they all alternately flash red also. The first couple nights, we just gazed in amazement and didn&#39;t notice too many details. But I do know they seemed to move very slowly if you watched them long enough. I don&#39;t mean that my perspective on them changed as Earth rotated; I mean that they steered every so slowly to a different position and then stopped. They also seemed to be clustered in one small area around Orion&#39;s belt mostly, until Orion&#39;s belt moved out of sight. BUT even after Orion moved out of sight these strange fake stars would still be in the same area. They never left the area even after Orion (there are rarely any other stars visible in San Diego at night lately) was way out of sight due to the Earth&#39;s rotation.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Nights of 1/3-1/5, I stayed out as often and late as I could given that I have three kids to take care of. I peeked out a couple times per hour, staying up late and watching them til 3 or 4 in the morning. They seemed to light in 1 position and stay there constantly for the most part on these nights, with the occasional one disappearing suddenly or shifting slightly. Colors remain same. I have noticed that there is one set that I call the Non-Rectangle, because if it weren&#39;t for one &#34;star&#34; being up and out a little bit too much, they would form a perfect rectangle. However, they are in a different configuration every night, i.e. the &#34;slightly off star&#34; would be on the bottom and left one night, and on top and right the next. Makes me think it&#39;s a craft that lands in a different spot every night and thinks we won&#39;t notice.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 1/6 and 1/7, 2010 I have not been able to go outside to watch their behavior, I have just had too many things to do.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I got video, in fact about 10 of them with my webcam since I don&#39;t have a regular camera, but strangely, I can&#39;t get them to upload to any of the sites I tried to upload them to. I managed to get 1 pic on my cell phone to show up and I will try to attach it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The oddest thing of all to me, is that no one else is talking about them, everyone is concentrated on the sham red lights of New Year&#39;s Eve that one guy hoaxed. However, my kids and mom see them, and so does my apartment complex manager, so they are truly there.<n> <n><n> <n><n> One other strange detail is that on 1/3-1/5, there have been a highly unusual number of small, low-flying normal planes as well as helicopters, making me wonder if they&#39;re &#34;investigating.&#34;  I have not been able to stay awake and outside to witness them make their &#34;disappearance&#34; at dawn so I don&#39;t know what that consists of.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They are currently still there, although small in number at this precise moment. I can&#39;t figure out for the life of me why people aren&#39;t interested in them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date is approximate.  PD))<n>

I live in a semi rural, wooded, small town 40 miles to the south west of stockholm, Sweden.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was out cross country skiing alone in the wooded countryside around the town in the proximity of nearby houses and a golf course.  It was pitch black but a very clear night.  Stars were clearly visible.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On coming out of the woods to the open golf course a light in the sky caught my eye approximately 300/4000 metres in front of me.  It immediately struck me as unusual and I stopped skiing wondering what it could be.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The light was well above tree level but did not appear exceedlingly high in the sky.  It was about the size of a very large light bulb (although it may have been larger had it in fact been higher in the sky-it was this which that was difficult to determine-height and size).  Colour-orange with a green haze around it.  It made no perceptable sound what so ever.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It moved slowly overhead above me and proceeded on in the opposite ditection.  The whole time the speed seemed absolutely constant, i.e. slow.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I watched the light move over me and off in the other direction.  On looking back to where I had first seen the light an identical light proceeded in an identical fashion on the same trajectory, overhead above me and off.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I wathced the two lights which appeared ! to climb into the sky until they were no longer visible.<n> <n><n> <n><n> From first seeing the lights until they disappeared must have taken about 5-10 minutes as I noticed I was becoming cold from just standing as oppossed to skiing.<n>

I drove south on 11st Street and headed out on East Post Rd to turn east on 30th St.  That’s when I saw two very bright white lights in the northwest sky; one positioned not far above the other.  At first glance I thought they were stars or perhaps a plane and a star, but then I realized they were both positioned unusually low in the sky. The top light appeared to ‘dart’ in its movement.  As I drove into more darkness I could see what looked like a faint beam pointing down to the lower, more southern light.  Then it appeared the top light began moving up and away from the bottom light, and at the same time it’s bright white light changed to numerous red lights (like the underneath of plane.) Within seconds these lights were totally gone from sight!!  Only the bottom bright light remained and it was moving very slowly as if it was floating alon! g.  As I continued to drive eastward this light grew dimmer and dimmer and within about 5 minutes it appeared to be in one place now, with no movement.  About 10 minutes past as I pulled into my driveway (I live on a hill) I took a last look into the northwest sky and could see the dim light appearing to remain static.  I am really wondering what the heck this was.<n>

He pointed to something that was very distant like a star, quickly flashing red/blue/green/white or yellow. The object was extremely bright, and we could tell it was emitting a great amount of light because it had a sort of glow. It was so far up that I thought it was a star “twinkling” from disturbances in our atmosphere until I noticed the red light was at the very top blinking slightly slower than the other colors which were quickly flashing. I thought it was almost pyramid or disk shaped, but it was so far that the lights almost appeared as one.<n> <n><n> <n><n> He then proceeded to tell us it could not be a plane because it had been in the same position for 35 minutes.  My friend also asked us if it could be a satellite, but it had no constant or regular movement pattern thus we concluded it wa! s not. We continued to stare at it and, using a street lamp as reference, I noticed it move slightly left. This movement was very minute. If there were another star directly to the left of it with almost no space between, that would be where the craft had moved. My boyfriend and friend were not paying attention when this happened and they did not believe me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We then noticed that it became very dim, and began thinking it was an airplane all along, but soon enough, the lights grew bright extremely bright then went to the same brightness it was from the beginning.  A few minutes later, using the street lamp to see if any movement had occurred while we were talking, my boyfriend showed us the object was now directly above the lamp and moving to the right of it.  Another friend who lived in the house came out and we showed him.  He said he thought it was a helicopter.  We argued it wasn’t because it was so high in the sky and had barely moved. During the time staring at it, we saw a helicopter and a plane pass over the sky.  They were much lowe! r.  As mo re friends came over throughout the night, we showed them, and none of them had an explanation.  The object appeared to be over Concord. Our ages range from 19 to 25, three of us have taken astronomy classes and have experience with observing the night sky.<n>

They are outside our atmosphere and appear as something similar in size to stars (as we view stars from Earth) but they move in every given direction. I’ve observed them stop and then start moving again, make 90 degree turns, suddenly increase speed until they appear almost a streak, stop just as suddenly, etc.  I’ve seen as many as 9 of them at one time (about 2 years ago), with all 9 of them going in different directions and patterns and “performing” in a manner that I would liken to an air show.  I’m so curious about them that I watch for them any time I go outside at night, just in case they might be there.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On December 30, 2009, at about 6:30pm I was outside smoking when I saw two of them toward the south-southwest and moving in a northerly direction.  About the time I saw them, my husband joined me on the porch and I pointed them out to him.  (I would note that my husband was in law enforcement for several years and is skeptical of nearly everything.)  As we were watching them, one of the “dots” split off into two “dots.”  I had never seen them do that before and it certainly got my husband’s attention.  At almost the same time, a 3rd and 4th one appeared in a different area of the sky (slightly more westerly and also moving north).  We noticed them at the same time.  The 3rd one then turned hard toward the east and immediately became incredibly bright – something else I’ve never observed one of them do.  It appeared to be banking in a turn and it grew even brighter as it banked and also seemed to elongate.  It quickly gained speed as it went east; turned a soft red color and ! then faded out of sight.  My husband asked if I had seen it get longer and I told him that I definitely noticed that.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Tonight (1.04.10) at about 7 p.m., I went out onto the porch and saw one of the “star dots” very far away and moving very slowly.  I was surprised as I usually don’t see them that close together, with the previous sighting being just 5 days ago.  As I watched it, I caught a bright light out of the corner of my eye.  I called out to my husband “There’s one of them flying VERY LOW this time!”  It appeared, of course, to be much larger than they usually appear because it was so low – somewhat lower than a commercial airliner would fly - but the light of it was too bright to allow us to make out its shape.  It was not flying in a perfectly straight line; it wavered slightly from time to time.  As we watched the low, bright one I remarked to my husband that it seemed to be tracking the smaller, more distant one move for move.  He agreed that that’s what it looked like it was doing.  We lost sight of it as it passed over our house.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Satellites??  PD))<n>

There was a spherical light in the northwestern sky.  It had FLASHING lights of white, green, red, NOT STROBE LIGHTS as on a plane.  The object stayed in the same spot and hovered around for nearly an hour and then moved off slowly to the north.  I thought maybe it was some kind of balloon, but we have been having 30-40 mph winds here for two days, so don’t think that’s it.  As it moved north it did not disappear on the horizon, just got smaller.  Then it changed shape and took on an elongated, cigar shape, with white lights flashing all around it, and blue/green lights flashing on one end.  Directly to the west, as this was hovering, there was another light, hovering, not as close, flashing more red.  I shined a flashlight in the direction of this one, looked away, then looked back and the red light was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We see a lot of airline and military air traffic where we are.  I saw planes go by as I watched these objects.  The objects looked to be much lower than the airplanes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I saw this same object, the spherical flashing, in October of 2008.  A couple of weeks before Christmas 2009, I saw this object early in the morning, around 5 a.m., only in the southwestern sky.  It seemed to flash a white light on the ground like a camera flash.  It was brighter that time (maybe closer?), hovered, then moved off to the west/southwest (NOT over the horizon) and disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My husband is a commercial pilot.  I have flown in commercial jets and Cessnas, seen them take off and land, been around them for 20 years.  This object does not behave like an airplane or have lights like one.  We live near a menhaden fish processing factory, which is right off the Chesapeake Bay.

During Military Police basic combat and advanced individual training at Fort Leonard Wood Missouri, myself and three other soldiers saw a UFO at around 0520. Our entire company was on the pt (physical fitness) field conducting warm ups. It amazes me that we didn’t have fifty witnesses, this could be due to the fact that we were physically engaged at the time and only my platoon was oriented in a manner that allowed me to witness the entire event.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were staying in rather large barracks nick-named “starships”. The PT field we were located at is positioned between Echo Co. 787th MP BN and Delta Co. 787th MP BN. The view on Google earth helps put my report in perspective. I was facing Delta Co. Barracks when I say the Triangle shaped craft slowly, silently and smoothly come over the Delta building in a way that I could tell it was only clearing the roof by 10-20 feet. So it was only 60-70ft above the ground and it took it no more than 8 seconds to fly over the building behind me, about a 465 ft distance on a heading of 356.92 degrees according to Google earth. I would estimate its speed at 50-52 statute miles per hour. Due to the light poles I could clearly see it was much thinner than it was wide and long. I would have to guess that someone human sized would have to have been lying down inside the craft. The surface looked smooth and dark but it was hard to tell with its movement and the lack of daylight. There w! ere five yellowish and dim lights on its bottom along the outside edges of the triangle.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The entire 22 weeks I was at Fort Leonard Wood there was only one day the A-10 Warthogs flew before daylight. This was that day, I could hear them flying all over the place about five minutes after the UFO flew over my formation. They flew around for maybe an hour and a half after I saw the UFO. After PT I asked everyone “Did you see that? If you saw what I saw you would know what I’m talking about.” Three other soldiers came up to me and we talked about what we saw. They all had the same descriptions, one thought it was an alien ship and the other two were convinced it was a new drone the military was testing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of sighting is approximate.

There was a cross-over in the highway as i turned around to go back and get a better look it started gliding away over the tree tops. I saw it in the distance as I headed back west toward Riverside, both green and red lights flashing. Finally disappearing into the night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It&#39;s shape was disc-like and completly blacked-out other then the flashing lights. Completly silent as i am prior-military and have been around many air-craft. I was in Kandahar, Afghanistan working night-shift on the air-field and have never seen a vehicle sit so still and quiet. Other then the visible flashing lights.<n>

But it started to curved towards our car. At this point, as if by magic, our car had shut off, including any lights that were in the car.  Also, our friend in the backseat was thrashing around and mumbling some wierd language. If the ship had not have come so close to our car, i would have passed it off as a government test or somthing like that.  But then the ship started to gradually speed up and change it course so that it was aimed directly at us.  Our friend in the backseat was thrashing so violently now, the car felt as if an earthquake was centerd directly next to us. Suddenly, right when the ship was about to hit us, everything went white. I couldn&#39;t feel or hear anything besides a high pitched ringing in both my ears. It was like i was dead for 10 seconds. I can honestly say it was the scariest moment in my enti! re life. When we all came back to our senses, the entire car was extremely hot to the touch. The ship was gone but I can still remember the glowing red surface of the ship though. If you&#39;re wondering, the friend in the back was there, sitting straight up. He still isn&#39;t the same person he used to be.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.  PD))<n>

As I turned onto my road the object started flying closer and closer to my vehicle.  It was so bright I could not tell what it was, and had a glow around it, like you see aroung the moon.  As I got out of the vehicle to look at it, it silently started descending over a nearby tree about 50 yards away.  I watched it for about 15-20 seconds and then it slowly went backwards, flew around another tree and took off quickly<n>

It was a beautifully clear night.  I noticed lights over the I-5 freeway that seemed to be too low in the sky to be a plane and they didn&#39;t appear to be a helicopter.  As we approached the object appeared to be hovering.  I pointed it out to my friend who was driving and said, &#34;What the hell is that!&#34;   At that time we were approaching a stop light on the corner of 3rd and Capital Mall and it was clear the object was moving but very slow.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At that point with all the lights from the freeway and building etc, all we could make out were the lights on the object which I think were red and white.  As we turned left heading South on 3rd Street, the object passed overhead slightly to the rear of the truck and we both clearly saw the triangle shape.  It headed West across the Sacramento River tow! ard the Port of Sacramento which is located in West Sacramento.  We both saw the triangle shape clearly as it passed overhead and we could see a white light in the center of the triangle.  Once it went over the river it tilted to the right and headed in a Northerly direction.  There were no news reports of any kind the next day.  It boggles the mind that something that big and that incredably close went unnoticed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> BACKGROUND INFO:  My friend and I are both 54 year old females.  She retired from State Service and lives in Idaho but is currently working as a retired annuitant.  Prior to retiring, she was an investigator.

It was a clear day, about 1pm, when I crossed 15th Ave. when I noticed a bright glare to the south.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It appeared to be a reflection of a plane, but it wasn’t moving.  I noticed it was only 20-30 feet above the roofline of the houses along the road; almost buoyant.  It seemed only 100 yards from me.  The center was about 8 feet long, maybe 1 foot in height, and very bright white (like magnesium).  It had light “spires” extending from the left and right horizontally.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Now I thought it might have been a toy rocket (residential area), but it was too bright for that.  The light did not shimmer, twinkle, or shift.  I could not figure out what it was, it did not smoke like a flare or move.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After about 10 seconds as I was watching, it just disappeared.  I watched it vanish!  There was no object to say what it was, no smoke trail, no nothing –like turning off a switch, the light was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have seen many strange things before, but what I saw that day...<n>

It appeared in luminosity similar to a star or satellite.  In addition, it appeared to be of very high altitude, again similar to a satellite.  This was apparent as the jet plane was passing from East to West at a high altitude at the same time I noted the unknown light.  The plane was crossing the sky at an approximate 50 degree relative elevation from my vantage point, and the unknown light was at an approximate 70 degree relative elevation when first sighted.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My initial thought was this was a satellite, as I have seen these many times at night and on occasion during the day.  However, this light did not behave as other satellites I have observed.  The light moved relatively slow in comparison.  The light took approximately 30 seconds to move directly overhead.  It then stopped for approximately 3 to 5 seconds.   The light very slightly grew in size and brightness during this period of first sight to the stop over head.  I also had called my wife out to see it during this period.   She also observed the light.  I asked to bring the camcorder to see if we could get the light on video.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The light then moved in westerly direction.  Again, slower than a plane or satellite.  We tried to film the light with two camcorders but are unsure if we captured it (we have not reviewed the tapes as of this reporting).  The light continued on its westerly course for approximately 3 minutes before I noted it was moving slightly to the west/south/west (say 15 degrees from true west).  The light was approximately at 75 to 80 degrees relative elevation.  Please note I can assure the light was very distant as it was obscured for a second or two by part of high cloud.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I continued to intermittently observe the light for another minute.  The light was dimming and becoming increasingly harder to spot.  It appeared to traveling directly away (i.e. out rather than in a particular direction).<n>

There was only one of them.  I noticed it because it had three very bright white lights on a triangular shaped object about the size of 3-4 king size beds (sorry that I can&#39;t be any more accurate).  It had a red light in the middle which went brighter and dimmmer.  I only seen it for up to 10seconds, I have limited view outside my bedroom window and it went pretty fast.  It didn&#39;t make any noise though.  I think the colour must have been black, or something very dark, its dark outside so i would have noticed it if was very colourful.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Hmm, about me: I&#39;m 19 yrs old, a makeup artist/model from Nottigham, England.

Anyway, I thought I would send them out to several people to see if anyone could be of any help.  I just wish I could zoom in with today&#39;s technology I&#39;m sure someone might be able to see some detail with these.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Any how yes I&#39;m saying that this is what I shot for a photo and I believe to be a UFO.  I would fill out your form but I want to be taken seriously and not ((deleted)).  I can’t believe what I saw and I will give you all my info here from my email.  If you really need my info then I will do it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is how it went.  January 1, 2010 my wife and I, and 2 of my good friends rented a room in New Hampshire at the Loon Mountain Ski club on the second floor of the building.   We had a balcony off our room over looking the Kangamangus Highway.  It was New Year’s night at about 10:00 pm.  I was out on my balcony by myself at first and when I saw this object of a bright whitish some what red color it was round in shape. I slammed on the glass slider to my wife and friends to grab a camera.  They came out so fast I almost went over the balcony.  My wife had the video camera and my friend ((female name deleted)) had the still camera.<n> <n><n> <n><n> From there the object slowly came from over the mountain top towards our hotel.  It gracefully made a left hand turn towards Rt. 93 which is a major highway.  It did take about a minute or 2 before it was off in the distance and it seemed to appear and reappear.  Then it was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We went back into our room and I was anxious to see what we had photos and vid! eo of.  It’s amazing that what was taken as a photo and what was on the video and what we saw are all three different object especially when you zoom in.  I was so worked up my eyes watered and I became tingly and numb.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We got so intrigued that we started looking up info about sightings in that area.  We found several occurring on that highway around the same days but different years.  Put it this way, as I right this almost 2 years later it still makes my head go tingly and numb.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Well as for the sound it was 10 pm and it was cloudy and snowing out.  You know how it gets when its snowing you can here a pin drop.  We didn&#39;t hear a thing and believe me it was close enough that you would hear at least something.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was too cloudy for a hot air balloon and 10 at night.  It wasn&#39;t a flare because it went for miles.  My uncle is a pilot locally here on the cape and I have been around small planes and helicopter my whole life.  I mean what in the hell flies when it’s snowing and! you can see the ceiling of clouds flying over head.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This has no explanation.<n>

What I am writing is not for my personal satisfaction of pulling anyone&#39;s leg.  I do not like telling this story because not even my family would believe nor would the families of the other three witnesses believe them, as well as it was a chilling event.  I didn&#39;t report this for years simply because it had not crossed my mind however I am very interested in the unknown and believe in extraterrestrial existence.  I swear to this story being absolutely true as i payed attention to the details as it happened.  This, I imagine, is a very rare report.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Three friends and I were driving through a very rural area in north east texas.  It was very late at night, probably 0330 as we were coming back from a party in a neighboring town.  None of us were hallucinating or in an abnormal state of mind.  We were listening to 99.5 the wolf, a country music station.  With no prompting, the data on the screen of the car&#39;s &#34;head unit&#34; changed to slashes and the audio coming out of the speakers changed...The following is the best way I can describe what came out of the speakers.  It was as if it was a recording of an interview with an astronaut.  The music stopped following by a very short pause then, what started playing was an older man (i would guess by voice) talking about being on a NASA mission outside of our earth&#39;s atmosphere.  During the said mission, the man recalled definately encountered what he referred to as alien aircraft (not UFOs) and that he and the others in his vessel could clearly see &#34;them&#34; out the window dogmatically.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This story the man was telling &#34;played&#34; for 5+ min.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As this was happening my three friends and I were silent at first, blankly looking at each other.  I was sitting in the back seat and wanted to make sure the two in the front were not playing a joke on me.  I leaned in the front seat and could see the Ipod in the car was clearly not plugged in nor was any other music or internet device.  Then my friend that was driving the car (the owner) pushed the power button on the &#34;head unit&#34; firm enough that it should have shut off and absolutely nothing happened.  Then he proceeded to turn the volume knob multiple turns in each direction and the volume did not change either. He repeated both power and volume actions again and still nothing happened.  The volume was still playing at a loud enough level we could clearly hear the details.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We sat in awe for the approximate five to near ten minutes that this was &amp;quot;playing&amp;quot; over o! ur radio in the car.  Nothing was around us as we were on a ro! ad surro unded by cut corn fields.  Suddenly the interruption stopped and was followed by the same one or two second pause that stopped the music and then the music started playing again (different song obviously as 5+ min. had passed.)<n> <n><n> <n><n> The three friends in the car with me were not sketchy friends for I had known them for approximately ten years and still know them all.  We have talked about the incident since and all have the exact same memory of the event.  I really hope you take this report seriously for it was the oddest thing that has ever happened to me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Feel free to email me back to tell me if you&#39;ve had a report like this before or if you would like to ask me any questions about my story.  Feel free to call me as long as it doesn&#39;t cost me money.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date is approximate.  PD))<n>

Rather than hit the ground, the ball straightened and then  headed over to the River Seven. Moving very fast it headed up into the sky and was out of sight in 1 minute.

We returned to our hotel around 1am and my husband was on the balcony smoking.  He called me out to look at something unusual.  I saw 6 or so orange orbs in the sky.  They were a unique color and at first didn&#39;t look like anything unusual until they started moving.  It was smooth but erratic and unlike any conventional flying machinery.  They would speed up and slow, turn corners quickly.  One appeared to have an even smaller orb orbiting it as it moved.  My husband said he saw a few like that but I only clearly saw the one.  There was also an airplane trail of clouds and the orbs clearly were under those clouds, so closer to the ground than an airplane.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I watched for about 2 minutes or so but my husband followed them for about 20 minutes.  Then they disappeared.<n>

Everything stopped when i turned they keys the car wouldn&#39;t make a noise.  It was very quiet and then we got out of the car and looked up. We saw two 15-20 feet long chevron shaped flying objects.  I was scared out of my mind. They were still were rimmed with blue and red and green and yellow lights.  It was a full moon and they had a distinct shape due to the bright sky of the full moon they were black but because of the lights, they kind of glowed they were moving slowly and down toward us.  Then something must have startled them but they moved north at a speed i have never seen anything go, and in a instant, the car turned back on, and the car alarm went off as well.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My miles in my car are now set to zero, which is cool, but my radio doesn&#39;t work and neither does any of our cell phones.

At first I thought it was a Satellite so as we drove (next 20-30 seconds) for it to pass above the clouds.  It did not so at that time we pulled over and I opened the sun roof as it was passing overhead then, it made a very abrupt 180 degree turn and proceeded back towards where we first sited it then made a 90 degree trun to the left (South to Southeast) and then disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am very involved in the aerospace industry and experienced aircraft observer (night and day), there were no red or green navigation lights, no white strobes, no flashing lights at all, it was a flickering orange yellow light that reminded us of flame whichis reason we thought it was a satellite at first.  With the windows down and sunroof open we heard no sounds at all.  The clouds were scattered and broken at 12,000 ft.

We had no alcohol consumption or narcotics.  It was approximately 12:20 am of the New Year.  We came upon and intersection and a family of 6 in the car in front of us exited their vehicle and looked north from their position. We thought they were looking at fireworks.  We looked towards the north to see what they were examining.  We pulled to the side of the road exited the vehicle and looked towards the direction the other family was. We thought at first the activity was fireworks but until all commotion stop 2 orangey-red lights were continuing to hover above the town. We followed the lights as they did acrobatic movements unlike any United States military aircraft. We continued to a back road heading south toward my house when in the rear view mirror we spotted another to objects behind us. We again exited the vehicle to observe the lights.  They slowly headed our direction from the northwest to the s! outh. The seemed to be circling each other, again doing acrobatic moves a normal aircraft is unable to perform. We continued to observe when one of the objects we lost behind a cloud in the northwest.  The other aircraft shot straight into the shy were we could no longer see it.  From there we continued home, I contacted my parents to see if they could see anything on the other side of town but they didn’t see anything. When I arrived home I made phone call to the police department were they had one reported sighting. Now I have come to report this to share my experience and get more info of what we saw on the first night of the new decade.<n>

What I though was a satellite abruptly stopped and remained in a stationary position for approximately fifteen seconds.  I was shocked!  The object then moved at a higher rate of speed heading east and disappeared about 15 seconds later.   This has been bothering me since the event and wanted to report this incident to someone who would understand.

I thought they were fireworks but I became clear that they were not as they did not disappear as fireworks do. Then a few more were pointed out to me in total I believe there were six. They were rather bright but varied in size. They seemed to stay at the same / similar level but moved sideways. There was one that was solitary all the way over to the left on the other side of the houses and there was one that was much larger than the rest and if you looked carefully it even looked like there were about three joined together.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As we were looking they moved off out of sight so I and one of the others came out of the front of the house to see where they had moved to. Upon going out of the house we found that we could now only see one, rather faintly and it seemed to have moved further away. The rest were not visible. At the speed they were initially moving I do not believe they would have had time to move off so quickly because it took seconds to get to the front door but still once we got there, there was only one left.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Backgrounds of the observers....One is a middle aged man, owns a shop.

We gathered together in front of the large cross right before midnight and both said some kind of prayer and set intentions for ourselves, others and the world for this next year.  We gathered together all of our negative energy and offered it up with appreciation for all the wisdom we gained from its challenges.  As soon as we offered them up towards the sky, we instantly noticed 3 Bright Circular Red Beacons in a triangular shape in the sky slightly north of our position on the hill.  They were just floating without any sound whatsoever and the light remained constant.  My friend said he noticed some flickering of another color (possibly green and red) as he zoomed in with his digital camera but I did not notice this nor was this apparent to the naked eye.  We thought! they might be helicopters at first but they seemed way too high, stationary, mute and close together to be so.  After a couple minutes or so, they began to slowly float directly above our location and then slightly past.  Their triangular shape began to grow smaller as the Beacons moved closer to each other.  Then, at approx. 12:15am, one Beacon began to move off in the distance towards Downtown SD and the waterfront.  The light eventually disappeared in the distance - again, no sound, no other blinking lights and very high up in the sky (nothing like a helicopter).  The other remained for about 2-3 more minutes.  Then they both began to fade as they seemed to travel farther and farther away from the surface of the earth.  By this time, the lights were in between the constellation Orion and the Blue Moon.  The lights, according to our best observations, did not simply dim and shut off but actually &#34;flew&#34; or floated farther and farther away from Earth until they finally dis! appeared from our view amongst the stars.  We did not see any addition al sightings afterwards.  We have short video clips from a Digital Camera of the lights throughout various times while they were present.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am not sure what they were, but they were not frightening at all.

Compared to a clock they were at appx 11:00 and 1:00 with the elongated triangle ending at 6:00. My home is in Mount Helix, Ca about 1/2 mile up Fuerte Drive from the I-8 Freeway heading east, my home is on the north side of Fuerte Dr and I was on my patio facing south. These lights were directly overhead as was the moon, they were just east of the moon, my husband and I both saw these and he and I both wondered if someone launched a very high balloon in the sky but they just sat there and hovered, I have never seen anything like this in my life, I’m 55. The entire triangle formation would be covered in length by holding appx 3 fists towards the sky from the two lights above to the one below, the two lights above were appx 1 fist apart from what I recall. They were much bigger than the surrounding stars like the ! size of an airplane light though they didn’t move and hovered directly over my home in this elongated triangle pattern for many minutes, maybe 4-6 from the time we both saw them. I went inside and came back out and saw they had moved toward the west and were still very bright, I went inside to find my camera and when I came back outside they were gone, no trace of them anywhere. It is crystal clear in the sky tonight and I have a great view, they were not completely round, maybe just slightly elongated circles of lights. There was also no audible sound like a plane engine, whatever this was it just hovered for many minutes without making any sound. I don&#39;t know if this was 3 separate things or one object with lights in a triangle shape.<n>

We look up and there are 3 red lights. Equally spaced apart in a straight line.  All of a sudden they moved north (together) then stopped in a triangular formation.  It hovered there for about a minute or so then the light at the north end dimmed and disappeared following by the light on the bottom right corner.  We stood watching when the final red orb also disappeared. It was bizarr-o.

I looked up and seen what appeared to be an Airplane flying overhead. I ignored it for a few seconds, then looked back and saw that it had seemed not to move. I noticed there were no blinking lights on it, and It also was orange in color. We often see airplanes overhead heading North and sometimes in the East. This was different much slower and no sound. I went and got my Video Camera and started filming. As I watched it, I walked toward the back of my yard and could see another one over the top of my house. Then I noticed they were moving very slowly because as I stood still I could see the change in height compared to the top of my roof. They seem to be five spheres or lights together in an arc. The middle light being the biggest, getting smaller toward each side. As I watched and filmed another appeared coming from the same southern location in the sky moving in a straight line! . I filmed one near the Moon as the other two rose in the sky. Then the one near the Moon disappeared fading out as I watched. Then I noticed as I watched each faded as I watched them get higher in the sky from over the top of my roof to above my head. But I started to realize by the time the fifth one appeared it had rose from the south but was disappearing more to the west and not directly overhead anymore. To me this meant it may have been moving outside of the earth’s atmosphere, and the earth was moving below them. Each faded out to the naked eye as they past slowly overhead. But if I used my night vision on my video camera I could still see them as they faded away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This was seen by my wife and two children ages nine and ten.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 4-1/2 minutes of my video is posted on Youtube “Objects in sky over Antioch 12:33AM Jan 1 2010”.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

We observed three red lights that looked like burning road flares floating a few thousand feet up in the dark sky, and we even watched as one burned out.  They appeared to be hanging and dangling in the light wind from a triangular frame of some kind.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;ve been told that the person claiming to have continually perpetrated this hoax had been interviewed on a San Diego TV news show in shadow to conceal their identity awhile back and had agreed not to do it again, but apparently they lied, or it&#39;s someone else doing it now.  Maybe it DOES fall under the category of &#34;UFO&#34;, but it&#39;s definitely terrestrial, and it&#39;s also a dangerous HOAX!<n>

I noticed out the passenger window two red lights hovering in the sky. It was hovering in the air, much too low for any aircraft that I would normally see. It was dark, and cloudy, but the moon still kept in light enough to see. I watched it for a few more seconds, confused as to what I was really seeing. I pointed in the sky, and asked my friends if they saw taht was well. As we kept driving, we could see it from underneath and to the side. The UFO was a wide triangular shape, with two red lights that sort of blinked at each end on the back. At the front tip was another light, and underneath there seemed to be another light closer to the front. The craft was dark, and thick. It was close enough that I could see the wings were the thick side angles. The craft was sleek, like a jet, but wider then anything I have seen. We all grabbed our cameras and pulled the car over. As we did t! hough, the craft (still hovering in the same spot) begin to rise. We got out of the car and the craft was higher in the sky. Then, it turned to the right while staying in the same spot, about 90 degrees, and begin flying away. It moved away from us fast, and was too far to take a picture. Within mintues we had seen this craft hovering above the city, then turn to face the right in the same position, and leave. No military type craft can hover in one spot and then turn on a dime like that. Another strange thing was that there was no noise that came from the craft, it was silent.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

These were not helicopters nor planes from what we saw.  There was no sound what so ever. No flashing red or green lights on the sides.   I was about half a mile and looked as if it flew over a nearby park that closes at 10 pm.  I am not sure what these were, but they were bright.  I did not see any flickering like a candle or flare.  They were very strange.  I tried to get the camera working for a picture and the camera would not respond.  The batteries were drained and I just put new batteries in the camera a couple hours before.<n>

They looked to be in a line shape, similar to the Orion&#39;s Belt Constellation in formation. They were moving slowly southward, with the center light moving slightly back and forth in between the outer two. After about 10 minutes the most southern one began to flash and drop down toward the horizon. The other two remained for another 5 minutes or so then faded out separately. I thought they were maybe some kind of Flare or firework at first, but it just seemed very strange to me. All three others of my family witnessed the event, along with four of my neighbors. I also called my friend in Spring Valley, and her and her father witnessed the event also.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

In a few mintures went right over my house. There were 4 green circles. They were very distinct and just kept going in circular motions. I looked into the sky and they went on over. I set back down thinking maybe it was some sort of advertising. I was sitting up alone right after midnight New Year&#39;s eve.  I sat back down and there is the bright green light so bright it lit up my whole front door through the glass. I looked out the dining room window which is beside the door and it disapeared. I sat back down and the bright green light was at the front door again. I opened it and it just disapeared again.  It was so bright, it lit up my house inside.  4 green circles that went over the lake circling themselves.<n>

At first they were in a triangular position, then they moved into a straight line, somewhat horizontal to the earth. I went inside to call a friend or two and when I returned outside one of the lights was gone. The other two lights started to flicker and die out, then one died. The last light remained for a couple minutes more, then it too died out.  Other than coming into alignment with each other, the lights did not move at all. They were stationary in the sky with a very bright glowing red color.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

As I looked to my left which is West in a saddle of these small mountains about a one mile and a half away I see these very bright lights.  As I watched them there was no noise at all and it was very quiet out that night.  These lights were in a pattern of three like a triangle. There were three separate UFO’s all in a straight row for a total of nine lights.  They were moving very slow over the saddle of the mountain.  My first thought was man that is some big mining equipment being moved at night.  But then I realized there was no sound which you would hear because it was that close.  The lights were very bright I mean like football stadium lights and they were lighting up everything out there under it from about sixty feet off the ground.  You could see cactus and rocks really clear too just like a bright sunny day. It was so dark out there ! that I could not see any sides or edges to what ever it was.  I watched it until it had gone over the other side of the saddle.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was perplexed as to what I had just seen. I thought I had seen three separate UFO’s flying together in formation.  But later after telling my wife what I had just seen. She said “well, how do you know it was three separate ones, maybe it was just one big UFO!’. Now that really got me thinking. That craft would have been huge.  I mean this saddle area it flew through is about the size of one to two football fields wide.  I heard you on the radio one night and got your web site. I thought you might like to hear about my sighting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness provides no contact information.  PD))<n>
