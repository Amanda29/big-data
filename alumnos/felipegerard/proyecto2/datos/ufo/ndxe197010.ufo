It wiped out the city, martial law was imposed, the National Guard shot and killed 9 looters over the course of the next two months.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were without power or electricity until mid-October of that year.  Soon after power was restored, one night in my outside my bedroom window, late at night, a very bright red and blue light appeared in backyard.  The lights moved up and down through a very heavily branched cedar tree.  I didn’t get up out of bed because I was way too scared to see.  Later that night, I woke up and I am not sure if I was hallucinating and seeing small little people with big fat heads and very big eyes in room looking around.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I put the covers over my head and wished that they would go away.  Nothing else happened then I fell asleep.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting in 1970 is approximate.  PD))<n>

We seemed frozen, watched stopped, arm hairs stood up.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I and my neighborhood friend were only 8 yrs old at the time and still remember this as though it just happened eventhough it was 30 years ago. No other sightings or occurences have happened since. It was a crisp clear calm starry fall night. We went outside taking the trash to the bins at the curb which face east. I lifted the lid with my right arm and started to put the bag in and I was frozen. I was able to move my eyes as I saw my watch on my left arm that I was holding the lid. It was stopped at 7:50 with the second hand also stopped at 50. I noticed the hairs on my arms standing up. I glanced to my side and saw my friend looking straight out and then I looked straight out and saw the object. It was still and bright, it looked like a smaller version of a bright moon. Then it darted diagonally to the north, so fast it really just appeared at it&#39;s new location about 45 degrees to the left from when it was directly in front of us. Then it darted back straight across back to the south and to the right of us about 45 degrees again. Then it shot back diagonally to the north and kept going out of sight, it vanished. We both were able to move again as the bag dropped into the bin, I threw the lid down and we both ran back up the stairs yelling as we went back into the house. We frantically told my parents what happened but we were both brushed off as two kids with overactive imaginations. Years later when I brought this up to my parents again, my father recalled that the TV set went to snow. He got up and changed the channel thinking that just that one station he was watching temporarilly went off the air. He turned the dial and just got snow on all of the channels. He said then they all came back on and he went back into his chair. I believe my friend and I experienced missing time because my Dad had time to get up, change channels and sit back down while it only seemed like seconds to us outside.<n>
10/15/70 23:00|San Diego/Pacific Beach|CA|Light|1 minute|I saw a UFO in the night sky over Pacific Beach in San Diego, & while being trailed by 2 jets firing tracers the object turned north on|8/5/09|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/071/S71382.html|3|ndxe197010| I saw a UFO in the night sky over Pacific Beach in San Diego, &amp; while being trailed by 2 jets firing tracers the object turned north on.<n> <n><n> <n><n> July 2009 My UFO Experience:  I was walking up the sidewalk/steps to our south facing home on Law St. in Pacific Beach (San Diego, Ca 92109) in 1970 or 1971, I think about 11 to 12pm when I glanced up at a cold clear night sky &amp; saw a large craft the size of a blimp perhaps with many lights (in fact all I saw were the lights, no outline of the object) approaching to my right &amp; slightly to the north moving silently from east to west.  It was being trailed by two fighter jets (I assume from Miramar Naval Airstation or North Island) that were shooting tracers towards it.  This obviously grabbed my attention.  I had never seen tracers other than in WWII documentaries.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As the craft came to be directly in front of me (well above the roofline of the house to the north), it turned north on a dime and accelerated &amp; vanished in an instant.  I realized that it was a UFO when I saw it streak towards LA like a bullet &amp; disappear.  The two jets, which I could now hear, continued to follow by slowly arcing to the north.  The pilots had to be as totally mystified as I was. No man made craft then or now could have made that maneuver.  I thought about reporting this to some authority like the police or the newspaper, but it was late &amp; I just went to bed.  I told my family &amp; friends the next day &amp; I combed the San Diego Union to see if anyone else had reported this but found nothing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is by far the most incredible &amp; unexplainable thing I have ever witnessed, and to this day I can still visualize it like it happened last night.  I have never witnessed a remotely similar event &amp; to my knowledge, no one has ever reported seeing a UFO over San Diego.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have always wanted to notify an appropriate organization to see if an investigation could locate a Navy report which had to have been filed by the pilots, perhaps two per jet.<n> <n><n> <n><n> From that point forward in my life I have always had a tremendous interest in UFO sightings, documentaries, stories, etc.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have had a lifelong interest in the manned space program (I  still have an old scrapbook of news &amp; magazine articles about the Mercury, Gemini &amp; Apollo programs) as well as astronomy &amp; the knowledge constantly evolving about the Universe. I loved the movie Contact so much that I read Carl Sagan’s novel which was just as awesome.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have watched some UFO programs on the Discovery Channel &amp; I believe there were several very well documented UFO sightings/encounters near Catalina Island or the Channel Islands around this time.  I have been wondering if there is a connection between those events &amp; the one I witnessed.  I would love to discuss my experience with a relevant organization in the hopes that it sheds new light or somehow furthers our understanding of this type of phenomenon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We are grateful to the source of the report for his having submitted.  However, talking about a sighting that is at least 38 years old does no good.  We are saddened that he did not contact the newspapers there locally, in order to report the event.  Date indicated for the sighting is approximate.  PD))<n>
10/15/70 19:00|London (UK/England)||Unknown|30 minutes|Single bright cone shaped beam of light.|8/24/10|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/077/S77374.html|4|ndxe197010| Single bright cone shaped beam of light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I found this site by accident, and it sparked a memory of something I observed 40 years ago.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The actual date is lost to me now, but I believe it was Autumn 1970, possibly October as it was dark at 7pm when I left my parent’s apartment to attend an evening institute class.  It was in a suburb of North London called Finsbury Park.  I was 20 years of age and considered myself observant.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Their apartment was at the top of a block about 50ft off the ground.  Their front door led out onto a balcony walkway with an unobstructed view over approximately a half mile square plot of land that had about six water filtration reservoirs surrounded by a collection of low buildings that I would guess, housed tool stores, offices and maintenance vehicles.  Apart from the residential viewpoint I was looking from, there were blocks of houses to the left and to the right of the filtration plant.  A busy main road ran along the front of the plant site, about a half mile from where I was standing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What I saw from the balcony was a cone of very bright light pointing down from above.  The wide circle of light slowly and methodically searched the reservoirs and buildings in circular motions.  The sky was inky black and the reservoir area was only lit by low powered security lights as the place was only worked in during daylight hours and never, as far as I can recall, at night.  At no time during this sighting could I make out any shape looking up at the apex of the light beam.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I called my father out and asked him what he thought it might be?  He said, ‘I think it’s an helicopter!’  I invited him to listen and he had to admit that all he could actually hear was the faint sound of the traffic on the main road, half a mile away and nothing else.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We stared at the light for another five minutes, then my father suggested that it might be a secret silent running helicopter with an astonishingly bright light that we don’t know about?  I suppose it was as good an explanation as we were going to get, though I rather doubted it on the grounds that if the military had perfected such a thing, then why did they insist on using extremely noisy machines in war zones? (to this day)  That’s the thing about helicopters, the noise, you can always hear an helicopter even if you can’t see it, the noise will bounce off buildings and trees which will make you look in the wrong place for it even if it’s behind you.  Unlike this thing which was somewhere in front of us and poss! ibly above us, but totally silent.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I left the apartment and made my way down to the main road.  On the way, I entered a gap in the houses and this time got a side view, ground level looking up at the cone, still I couldn’t see anything on top of it, and it remained totally silent. Next I went to the main road and stared at the same view, this time with my parents apartment block behind the light source.  No silhouette, no sound other than the traffic behind me as the beam of light continued on it’s rounds of the site.  I stopped a man passing by and asked him to look at the light.  He didn’t, he just looked at me then accused me of being a drug addict. I got on a bus to go to my class and tried to get some passengers to look out of the window, most just looked at me, and the only guy who bothered to look out said it was an helicopter!  Helicopters were not that common in the U.K. back then as they are now.  Police helicopters and Air Ambulances are such a common sight these days that they seldom register.  Certainly the military had them back then, but you never saw any in suburban areas.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I witnessed this event, I was keen to tell as many people as possible.  Firstly, when I tried to inform whatever authority I could find, the Police, local government, newspapers, Water Authority and the BBC, was treated with disbelief or just plainly ignored.  The only thing the Police was interested in was where I had obtained the Water Board’s (Water Authority) phone number from when I told them that I had already spoken to them, and they told me to contact the Police.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Over the years, I have related that story to people who I believed might make some intelligent use of it, but all I’ve ever got was ridicule and anger.  One smart guy I thought better of, shouted ‘YOU SAW A HELICOPTER’ and refused to talk about ever again.  People who were not there at the time and people who were not even born at the time have accused me of being on drugs, drunk, mentally unstable or just a plain old liar.  Some have offered physical abuse while a few have actually hit me.  The worst I suppose was having someone at a party tell the other guests that I’d seen a flying saucer with little green me in it.  No!  I would try to explain, what I encountered was a U.F.O.  It was above me, so ‘Flying’.  It was, I’m sure, an ‘Object’ and it was and remains so, ‘Unidentified’   A couple of years before that happened, I saw what appeared to be an aircraft flying high in the night sky. The single tiny white light was constant and moved in a straight line across the sky quite slowly giving the impression of great height.  Then directly above me, the light made an abrupt 70 degree angular turn and shot upwards and was gone in a second.  The various explanations I have been offered, either cynically or violently have been:-  You saw a...comet, a shooting star, a meteor, an aeroplane, a spy plane, a weather balloon, a satellite, a Chinese Lantern, the Moon and even Venus.  It’s little wonder I haven’t mentioned these things too much over the last four decades.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

I kept on trying to act as if I didn&#39;t see what I saw.  I believe the year was 1970.  I was in line to go into my elementary school.  I glanced up, and my friend was with me, dont remember who she was, but I&#39;m sure she has this same memory, wherever she is today.  I saw something black, going around the sun several times.  This was the middle of the day mind you.  I was not seeing things, I know I saw something, and it was very real to me.  I don&#39;t know what this means, but maybe, someone saw something similar around that time?  One never knows.  Thank you for giving me a place to say this.

10/1/70 23:00|Indian Ocean (USN vessel)||Light|3-4 minutes|Bright object seemingly appeared out of nowhere in the Indian Ocean, miles from any land.|7/8/04|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/037/S37948.html|8|ndxe197010| Bright object seemingly appeared out of nowhere in the Indian Ocean, miles from any land.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were aboard a US Navy destroyer in the India Ocean. It was a warm, clear, moonless night, with a few clouds on the horizon opposite our direction of movement. We were steaming at a steady rate of approximately 5-7 knots; seas were calm, visibility approximately 12-15 nautical miles.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A group of us was standing on the &#34;flight deck&#34; just forward of the fantail. Although it was quite dark, our eyes had become accustomed to the night from the light of the stars. We were facing aft, watching the wake of the ship slip toward the horizon, making small talk, when suddenly, out of nowhere, a very bright light appeared just above the wake, and looked to be approximately half-way between the ship and the horizon. There were clouds on that horizon so we knew it was between the clouds and the ship, but we couldn’t determine much more about it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Because of the conditions, it was virtually impossible to tell how big it was or how far away it was. (If I had to make a guess as to its size, maybe a pea held at arm’s length.) We couldn&#39;t discern any shape due to its brightness. It was brighter than Venus ever appears, almost brilliant but not blinding, and at first it seemed to be stationary. It was silent, as far as we could tell. But as we watched, it began to move slowly across the ship&#39;s wake from our right to our left. When it had crossed the wake, it stopped and then proceeded to move back the other way, from our left to our right. It did this a few times and, during this time, we were shouting to each other the excitement we felt as we were trying to analyze this object and its movements. &#34;Was it moving closer to us as it traversed the ship&#39;s wake?&#34; &#34;Was it a solid object or just a ball of light?&#34; &#34;Where did it come from?&#34; &#34;How did it get to where it first appeared without anyone seeing it?&#34; &#34;Did the ship&#39;s RADAR pick it up?&#34;  We watched in amazement for about three or four minutes, no longer. Abruptly, it stopped its movement altogether and appeared to just &#34;hover&#34; in place. Then, without warning or any change in its appearance (or sound) it shot directly straight up into the sky and within four or five seconds had apparently traveled out of sight, or it had dimmed out. But the general consensus at that time was that it appeared to diminish in brightness because it had traveled far enough away that it simply got too far for us to continue to observe it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The following day we asked some of the guys in the RADAR room and they all said nothing peculiar was picked up on RADAR that evening.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

The avenue was bustling with people and motorists. A passenger bus was approaching....suddenly a humming sound caused us to look upwards towards the night sky. A strange lighted object shot down very fast and hovered across the street from my home above some buildings. It reminded me of the saucer from Lost in Space...the craft with very bright and colored lights went clockwise. As the saucer turned its angle a bottom set of colored lights shone displaying a smaller disk which was attached and the lights were going in a counterclockwise motion. The saucer (or disk) remained hovering for about 1 min. Suddenly it shot out into the sky and disappeared completely.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

The craft was hovering about 5 miles away over Temple Terrace Florida.  To this day, I do not remember ever seeing anything like it since.  My mother also claims that she saw something.

As we were heading towards the back of the home we both immediately saw a disk like object hoovering above my Grandmother&#39;s vegetable garden. It was so close that I went to pick up a rock to throw it but my Dad smacked the rock out of my hand.I was six years old at the time !  It was your classic disk shape, light grey in color, with multi-colored lights I think that were roatating in a clockwise fashion. It was hovering not more than 20 feet from us yet it did have some movement in trying to stay in place but ever so slightly. I don&#39;t recall any heat coming off the object. I did hear a buzzing sound. The dimensions weren&#39;t very large maybe big enough to fit 4 humans comfortably inside. At a certain point I recall a small panel on the inferior-anterior edge of the saucer slide open and some sort of camera like cone shaped obect come out and pointed it at us, almost like it was observing our actions.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My Dad said to stay put and keep an eye on it while he went into the house to telephone some friends.  Ater a few seconds of finding myself alone with this floating disk I got scared and ran into the house. When we came back out the disk was gone and I was very disappointed. I don&#39;t exactly know the exact time and Month when this occured but I born in 1964 and I was six at the time so the year was 1970. I remember wearing a t-shirt so it was either late summer or maybe during a warm spell in Fall. Over the years I would every now and again mention it to my Dad if what we saw was real and he said yes it was. I&#39;m sorry to say that my Dad died last year but I today I have found your website and this is why I am writing to you in order to remind me that it was true what we saw that afternoon. My Father was a very successful M.D. and I too am a M.D. This  experience has stayed with me forever. I did do some research maybe a couple of years after I saw it but I never found anything. I guess at the time I was too young. We never mentioned it to anyone except to family and very close friends for fear of being considered crazy. Thank you very much for the opportunity in giving my eyewittness account that was much overdue ! With regards Frank C.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Spherical grren orb. 3 minute duration.  Bright green orb travelled slowly and then took off extremely qui<n> <n><n> <n><n> Spherical object about 1/4 mile away travelled west to east along the shore of Lake Ontario at Kingston.  Object was lime green and about the size of a street light or slightly larger.  It travelled very slowly along the shore (above the water) at a height of about 300 feet.  It travelled in a straight line at constant altitude. Then it shot off, extremely fast, in a south-east direction in what appeared to be an arc. It got smaller very quickly which I assume meant that it was travelling away from me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This was a single object and I never heard of a report about ir on the local news. I was a first year university student (Queen&#39;s University). The object was bright enough that I first saw it shining through my room curtains. I then went to the window and watched it for about 3 minutes.<n>
10/1/70 00:00|Viet Nam||Light|5/10 minutes|U.F.O. in Vietnam 1970.|6/4/04|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/037/S37234.html|15|ndxe197010| U.F.O. in Vietnam    1970<n> <n><n> <n><n> One night, high in the mountains of the vietnamese jungles..I, along with my gun crew were manning a machinegun overlooking the steep slopes of a mountain ledge and we were talking softly of home and wondering if any of us would get back there. When, suddenly , a bright lite, very high up in the sky attracted our gaze. The night sky was clear and we can see countless stars above but this light was brighter then any of the stars that was above us, when , suddenly, the bright light began to move in a very precise way. It moved out horizontally and and without stopping, it went down in a vertical ascent and then horizontally and then vertically down and it did this like moving down a step of stairs at such pricise angles about a half dozen steps and then in a perfect return arc to the point it first started moving...it had return to it&#39;s original position and then in a flash, it moved up and out into space at a tremendous speed and disappeared from our sight. We knew of nothing in our arsenal or anyone else&#39;s that could have made maneuvers like that.As for being nowhere near civilization, after a few days ,we had all forgot about what we had seen and never made any sense of it anyway. Just wanted to get that off of my chest, after all these years, I believe that at the time, we had witnessed a U.F.O.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.
