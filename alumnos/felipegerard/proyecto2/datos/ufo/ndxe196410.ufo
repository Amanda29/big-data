This friend &#34;Bill,&#34; was an avid amature astronomer to the point he personally ground his own ten inch lense by hand for a telescope he build himself. One night while viewing stars with his four inch scope he came accross a ball shaped object hovering in space. The ball was large enough in his small lense so that he could actually see some sort of hyroglific writting on the object. He desperately wanted to go in and get his larger ten inch scope but did not leave for fear of losing sight of the object completely. After watch the object for ten minutes all of a sudden four smaller craft came out of the larger object in a single file at a slow speed and departed. Bill kept his focus on the large object. After about twenty minutes to a half hour the small ships returned and re-entered the large object. Then after maybe another period of ten minutes or so the large ball (mother ship?) took off and disappeared into outer space.<n>

We started to throw high passes to each other when I saw a tiny silver object at a high altitude.  I thought nothing of it because at that time there was a U.S. Naval Base located just North of New Iberia and seeing aircraft was a frequent everyday sight for us.  We continued to throw the football to each other and I decided to throw a high pass back to my friend.  We both looked up at the ball and we both became nearly speechless.  There was a huge circular chrome craft with a circular shaped bar going from one side of the craft to the other.  It had a clear glass looking globe in the center.  I told my friend to get his dad, quick.  His dad came out of the house and saw it.  When he came out the craft rose in altitude until it was out of sight.  It took it maybe a second or two to do this.  The strange thing about it was it made no noise at all.  His dad who was a Naval officer in World War 2 went inside immediately and called the Naval Base.  He spoke to the radar personnel and asked them if they had seen anything strange on their radar and he gave them the approximate time we saw this thing.  They told him it was probably just a weather balloon.  He then told them about his Naval career and told them no weather balloon could have traveled that fast.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Every time I go back home and run into my friend I ask him if he remembers what we saw and he says yes.  I asked him to draw it to make sure it was what I remembered what it looked like and his sketch matched what I saw.  I don&#39;t tell anyone about this anymore because they don&#39;t believe it and think I am crazy.  Some say they have seen strange lights at night but my buddy and I saw this craft on a cloudless day.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous;  provides no contact information.

My sister and i shared a room and we had bunk beds, mine was athe top postioned right next to the window.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I awoke one night to see a cigar shaped cylinder moving in an irregular pattern, occasionaly hovering, there seemed to be faint green glow to the object and there was some sort of glowing entrail, it appeared to be just over my back yard.  It was beautiful, but I remember being frightened.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I yelled for my mother but by the time she came into the room, it rose into the sky and had left. No one believed me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The next day I found an odd rock in the yard that for some reason I have carried with me to this day, throughout many moves, throuough many states.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I can still see the image in my mind over 40 years later.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.

I looked out my bedroom window and I saw something shaped like a manta ray.  I remember being so scared and then I was in this bright white room.  I saw beings hovering around me and I heard in my head don&#39;t worry we are not here to hurt you.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then I saw some overhead equipment and I felt a pain in my right shin ever since then it have had very strange an vivid dreams they say you can&#39;t read in dreams well I can and it isn&#39;t always English or any other language.  I have been told that I speak a strange language in my sleep.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have something hard under my skin on my right shin have had it since that night.

It was years before I told ANYONE about this incident. It was in October of 1964 or 1965, and it was the general deer hunting season. I&#39;d followed in my Dad&#39;s steps and loved to hunt and fish. Since we lived about 10 miles out of town, I could drive home from High School, change clothes and take our Jeep CJ2 on an evening hunt.<n> <n><n> <n><n> School let out just before 3 P.M. Each day, it&#39;d take 15 minutes to drive home, another 5-10 minutes to change clothes and I&#39;d have about 2 hours to hunt.  Living in the area for quite some time, I knew the best areas of “jumping” a buck deer from his bedding area, and as I was hunting alone, I&#39;d try to get an area where I could get a clear shot if I did indeed jump a buck from his bed.  This afternoon I drove directly to the north side of Gray Butte (southern Jefferson County,Oregon) and up a “Jeep road” that went about halfway up the sharp little butte, (Grey Butte) I parked the Jeep which had no top and the windshield was in the down position, typical of military built Jeeps, so I could get a very good view of the area to the northeast. I parked in the only somewhat level area at the top (end) of the road, set the parking brake and glanced the area I was going to hunt. A “glint” or reflection of light caught my eye from a northerly position. I didn&#39;t give it much thought as we lived in an area surrounded by small, local airports, and it was a very common sight to see small aircraft on any given day.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was about to get out and start my walk (hunt) when the thought occurred to me that I could not hear the engine of what I thought was a small airplane, yet it was only about half a mile away. As it was a calm, clear day, with no clouds, I took a rest and looked through the 4X scope of my rifle at what I was sure would be a small plane. Wrong! The craft had NO WINGS, NO VISIBLE TAIL, NO WINDOWS, NO EXHAUST, NO MARKINGS........AND NO SOUND! I immediately shook my head (in case I was having dilutions or ?) I looked again. The craft continued at what I estimated was 65-80 mph, about the same speed as a small single engine airplane would be cruising.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I thought I was hallucinating! I looked at my watch....4:35 P.M. Broad daylight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Yet, what I was seeing was not what I was believing! The craft never deviated from the steady cruising speed that I likened to a small planes speed. I watched until I could no longer see the craft through my scope, as it continued southward. It took about 10 minutes for this entire episode to pass. I would estimate the craft was 30-40 feet long. I think it was about ½ mile overhead and a slight bit to the east. It was over 10 years before I mentioned this to my parents. I thought they&#39;d think I was drinking. To my surprise, they actually believed what I told them. It was too bad I was alone on that butte. I would have appreciated a witness!  P.S. In this account, we were living in the same place as in account #1, southern Jefferson County, Oregon, with a Culver, Oregon mailing address.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A secondary note: I NEVER was a drinker. Neither of my folks were drinkers.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.
