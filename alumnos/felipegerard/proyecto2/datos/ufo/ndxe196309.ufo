I got up and went into the kitchen/dining room and looked out of the window, the whole yard surrounding our house and the &#34;in-laws&#34; house about 50 feet away were bathed in a bright white light. I awoke my wife (now ex) and told her I was going out to see what was going on, all the while I was aware of a loud humming sound, similar to an electric turbine noise.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I grabbed ny .303 rifle and some shells and a flashighlight and proceeded to open the door to the side yard, the moment I stepped outside the light disappeared and the noise suddenly stopped, I walked out into the yard and there was not a thing to be seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> During the time the light was on I had looked out of the rear bedroom window and noticed a large doe deer in the backyard under one of our apple trees, I shone my flashlight in that direction while outside but she had gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I should point out that our houses were on a remote road gravel with the nearest neighbor some 300 yards away, there were no other neighbors within a mile in either direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date is approximate.
