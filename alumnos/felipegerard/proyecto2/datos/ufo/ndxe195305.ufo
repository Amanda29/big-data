This is not a joke.  People have been looking for this for years to determine if it really happened.  It did.  I have pictures of the items left by the researchers.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We have corresponded with the source of the report, who forwarded photos.  They show piles of abandoned, apparently rusted, metal.  We have no reason to suspect that the photos are related to a UFO crash.  PD))<n>

I was extremely interested in aviation at that time and knew just about every type of aircraft. The ceiling was approximately 1000 ft , myself and two friends saw three discs  approximately 30 ft in diameter moving in a triangle formation from North to South at the base of the cloud layer. They would flip up simultaneouly into the cloud layer and then descend out of it. They made no sound. It appeared to me that they may be reacting to the height above ground and would rise by flipping upwards to gain more height. If anyone has a similar flipping siting would they please post.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>
