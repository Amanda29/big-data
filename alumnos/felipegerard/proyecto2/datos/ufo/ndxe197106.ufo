It occurred late spring early summer when I was about 10 years old in Dayton, Ohio. We lived 2 houses West of Our Lady Of Mercy church. It was after dark and the family was watching TV in the dining room. I looked east out the side porch window and saw the craft. It was oval from what I could tell, with yellow light comming from what looked to be windows around the center of the craft. The craft was at 50&#39;to 70&#39; altitude judging from the tree height over which it was moving.The craft was at a distance of 150&#39; to 200&#39; from our house. I yelled for my family and they moved to the windows and saw the craft too. We then ran upstairs to get a better view of the craft. It moved slowly taking perhaps 20-30 seconds to move out of sight over the woods that bordered church property. While we were watching the craft a figure was seen inside who looked to be working controls of some sort. The figure was backlighted by the glow and I only was able to make out a dark human type shape. The following morning my brother and I went back in the woods where the craft had dissappered. About 200&#39; inside the woods there was an area of crushed brush and even a couple broken saplings the largest being about 2&amp;1/2 inches in diameter. This area was about 50&#39; around, circular. And about 20&#39;to 25&#39; apart in the center there were 4 holes. These holes were about 3&#34; wide and 6&#34; to 8&#34; deep. For several years following this sighting very little grew in the crushed area, and what plants that did grow there were sickly as was a tree that was on the edge of the area. No sound was ever heard from the craft, and though the outline was rather vague due to the darkness, There was no sign or visible means of propultion, and a absence of any engine sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

I watched for a minute and got my boyfriends attendion and said look, that airplane isn&#39;t moving. Then is just took off up into the sky so fast, that you know nothing on this earth could go that fast. About six months later in the exact same spot we saw the same thing agian.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Both of these events took place at night. The object were the same both time, like a sauser shape. Couldn&#39;t tell the color. Each time there was only one.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Another time I was sitting on the front porch and was looking across the road into the nabors big field and saw something tall, all black, with long legs and arms. Looked like somthing off the movie with Will Smith in that alien move. It was walking on the edge of the woods. I was too far away the get any details on the face or anything else. From where i was sitting I would say I was about 300 houdreds yards away and the thing was half as tall as the trees. These were tall pine trees and it&#39;s head came to the middle of the tree. I saw it for about 30 sec and couldn&#39;t take my eyes away in shock. It disappeared into the trees. All these sighting have happened in the same area. I know about 3 other people that live in these area that have seen similar things as I have described.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

It was going parallel with Lovejoy Rd. we were shocked and watched it proceed straight as it went until it looked like it landed way out in ((male&#39;s name deleted)) dad&#39;s field just beyond a line of trees.  I told ((male name deleted)) he should go out there the next day and see if he sees any evidence.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The craft was so quiet, maybe we wouldn&#39;t have noticed it if it wasn&#39;t for the lights on the outside.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date is approximate.

6/27/71 23:00|Sunnyvale|CA|Other|five minutes|Hard to describe floating box scared the heck out of two teenage girls many years ago|8/7/11|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/082/S82744.html|5|ndxe197106| Hard to describe floating box scared the heck out of two teenage girls many years ago<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;ve never told anyone about this.  It&#39;s extremely hard to describe what I saw but even though it happened so many years ago I will never forget it.  The best I can do is describe it in symbolic terms because it can&#39;t be explained otherwise.  Kind of like Ezekiel described his wheel inside a wheel, it was the best he could do, I&#39;ll have to try to do the same using symbols that are familiar to me but that I know are terribly insufficient to the task.<n> <n><n> <n><n> That said, this was in the summer of 1971.  My friend and I had snuck out of our houses around 10pm after our parents had gone to bed.  Being teenagers we just liked to meet at night and go for walks and talk.  We were very young, innocent kids.  There were no alcohol or drugs in our lives, we were stone sober coming back home from our walk that night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was about 11pm when we were walking down the sidewalk on Remington Street.  This is a very long, straight, wide residential street, two lanes on each side of the road.  About a quarter mile or so ahead was an intersection with a four way traffic light.  The night was absolutely still, there was nobody out and nobody&#39;s house lights were on.  Our town was sound asleep.  As we walked down the sidewalk my friend was chatting endlessly as was her way and I was looking at my shoes when she suddenly stopped and said, &#34;What is that?&#34;  I looked up and I also stopped.  On the other side of the intersection a good long way away, probably a full five minute walk ahead, there was something hovering in the sky, pretty low, about the height of the tops of the street light poles.  It was absolutely silent.  This thing was moving very slowly forward, and every once in a while it would stop for a couple of seconds, as if it were looking, surveying, or something.  We stood there absolutely transfixed and didn&#39;t say a word to each other as we watched it slowly come toward the intersection.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Across the intersection on the left side of the street there were half a dozen two story apartment buildings, and on the right side was the open field of our old middle school.  This thing that I&#39;d say was about the size of a 20 to 30 foot boat was just slowly gliding down the middle of the street and then it turned a little and hovered over to the apartments.  It hovered over the roofs ever so slowly, going up a little and then down a little, as if it were checking them out.  At the second apartment building back from the intersection it was possible to get a better look at the thing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It&#39;s extremely hard to describe this and it will sound very strange but to be clear, I can&#39;t really grasp what I was seeing.  It was impossible.  It made no sense. But there it was anyway.  It didn&#39;t have any lights and it didn&#39;t look metallic.  The closest description I can find is that it looked kind of like wood.  Like a square ship made of wooden beams.  It was brown, and hollow on the inside without a top.  It had these great enormous arms on the sides that slowly swiveled around and they had lines on the ends, like ropes, but they weren&#39;t ropes. There were also shapes and objects inside the opening but I couldn&#39;t give a description, I was only aware that it wasn&#39;t hollow space inside there.  It was as if this thing was collecting things.<n> <n><n> <n><n> While we were watching it, it did not seem to be aware of us at all, but then, all of a sudden that changed.  It&#39;s angle changed and it came away from the buildings and back into the street.  It began to speed up heading toward us and as it hovered over the intersection, because of the street lights, we were able to get a good clear look at it.  That&#39;s when both of us became absolutely terrified.  It was looking right at us.  It took on an aggressive feel, its back end rising up and the front end lowering, like it was strongly checking us out.  I mean to tell you we were scared.  We both felt in fear for our lives.  I have never been so afraid.  It&#39;s hard to talk about this the fear comes rushing right back.<n> <n><n> <n><n> That thing began to head right for us and my friend said, &#34;We&#39;ve got to get out of here&#34;.  She took off running and I just followed her.  She was heading home.  What was so scary was that between us and that thing was one side street and we had to get to it before it did so we were running as fast as we could, right towards it, and I was terrified and literally praying we&#39;d get to that street.  Somehow we both knew that if we turned that corner we&#39;d be okay.  We didn&#39;t talk about this until afterward but we had to get to that street or something unthinkable would happen to us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We did get to that street and we ran around the corner nearly hysterical with terror when we ran smack into her father, who had come out looking for his daughter.  Even though he was very angry we were so happy to see him at that moment and we quickly told what had just happened.  He walked to the corner and looked down the street and saw nothing.  Nothing was there anymore.  He could see that we were not making things up, that we were truly scared and panicked, but he dismissed it and said it was probably just a weather balloon.  If I am sure of anything it is that that thing was no weather balloon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I know this is a very unusual description of a sighting but I am sharing it in the hope that maybe some other people have seen this thing or something like it, and they will know they&#39;re not alone and they&#39;re not crazy.  I am telling it like it was and have no reason to make up a story.  It doesn&#39;t matter if I am believed or not, I know what I saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.  PD))<n>

6/15/71 23:30|Castlefod (UK/England)||Other|4minutes|I sighted the three objects at 11-30pm. They approached from the north. They came directly towards me until at one point they were virt|6/23/99|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/007/S07875.html|7|ndxe197106| I sighted the three objects at 11-30pm. They approached from the north. They came directly towards me until at one point they were virtually overhead. They were all three flying in a very close formation in a line three abreast. They were just below cloud level. When they were almost directly above me you could make out the shape of them quite easily. They were completly silent with no visible sign of propulsion. No lights on them at all. They matched the over cast sky almost pefecly. They were in my sight for I would say about three to four minutes. One of the objects on the outside of the three then made a perfect right angle turn away from the other two objects. At that point they were lost from my view because of near by buildings.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The exact year I saw the three objects over the town I was living in at the time was 1971. It as taken me all these years to talk about the sighting because at the time of the sightings I did not wish to make my sighting too public because I did not want certain types of people knocking on my door. Plus all those years ago there was no such thing as the internet where you could talk about these things to people and still reatain a certain amount of anonymity. So that is why I waited all these years to tell my story. At the time of my sighting I was interested in astronomy and was building my own 6&#34; Newtonian reflector telescope. So as you can appreciate at that time I used to spend quite a lot of time looking at the sky. On this particular evening I had just gone outside to put the milk bottles out for the milk man to collect the following day. The year was 1971 it was a Friday night but I have to be honest I&#39;m not sure now what month of the year it was. To carry on with the story as I was out side in the back garden of the house I happened to glance up at the sky. The night was fine and dry but the sky was very overcast with cloud. What I saw then I can hardly beleive I saw even today sometimes. What I saw were three objects heading in my direction. They were well below the level of the clouds and were very easily seen by the naked eye. The three objects were in a perfect formation three abreast. They were also very close together. Far closer to each other than coventional would fly under normal conditions. They approached me in complete silence until they were almost directly above my head. I would guess there speed, but it is only a rough guess, at no more than 15miles per hours if that. When the objects were almost overhead there shape could be easily defined without the aid of binoculars. I have yet to see after all these years of seeing pictures of UFO&#39;s still to see an object with the same shape as the three I saw. I would best describe it as Like a football cut exactly in half, but with the bottom edge slightly rounded. Viewed from above or below as I saw the object it would appear perfectly round. The colour of the three objects was almost a perfect match with the night sky. I would describe the colour as a dull brownish grey. All three were perfectly silent with no visible signs of propulsion. Which would easily been seen from the distance they were from me by this time. There were no lights on them at all. They just seemed to be gliding across the night sky. Just before the objects went from my view because of the surrounding one of the objects made a perfect 90 degree turn away fro the other two. But unlike conventional aircraft it did not turn in a radius. One minute it was flying in a forward direction the in an instant it changed direction The other two objects continued to fly in a southerly. The objects had approached me from the north. The single obect I would say headed west. At that point I lost sight of the three objects over the roofs of the nearby houses. I mentioned my sighting to my work colleagues the very next day at work but I think they were a bit sceptical about what I had seen the previous night. I can&#39;t say I blame them. I think I would be too if someone told me about such a thing. Other than telling a few people at work at the time I did not make the sighting too public. I still tell peole about my sighting even today when I get into conversations about UFO&#39;s and the like. But I think they take what I tell them with a pinch of salt. All I would like to had to my story is the fact that in my oppinion the three object I saw that Friday night in 1971 were definitly not manufactured on this planet.<n>
6/15/71 23:10|Karnes County|TX|Circle|3 minutes|UFO sighting over open pit uranium mine.|6/23/99|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/007/S07896.html|8|ndxe197106| UFO sighting over open pit uranium mine.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The summer of 1971, I was working the night shift for Conoco Oil Co. at an open pit uranium mine west of Karnes City Tx.   I was one of 6 people operating Caterpillar 657B earth movers. We were down to about 210 feet deep when this incident happened.   It was about 11:10 PM , just after shift change we were getting ready to crank our machines, when the 85 acre pit lit up as if it was daylight.  The light was so bright that I had to squint because it hurt my eyes.  I remember hearing a high pitched hissing noise and the hair on my arms stood on end.  I was so scared, I fell to the ground and started praying.  I remember trying to look up, but the light was so bright I couldn&#39;t.  After about 2 minutes, the light started getting dimmer and I could finally look up at it. What I saw amazed me.  The object was round and the bright light was coming from the center of the bottom of the UFO.  Around the perimeter of the craft was hundreds of penlight size light beams that alternated in all colors of the spectrum.  Now I know they were laser beams.  The UFO was rising up slowly at first and then went straight up out of sight in about 10 seconds.  I was crying and shaking and so was everyone else.  The other shift workers thought we were crazy when we told them what had happened.  But we got the last laugh.  This is how we proved it actually happened. There is a vein of uranium ore that runs from George West Texas to almost Texarkana Texas.  When determining where to place a mine, the following steps are accomplished:  (1) A geologist with a geiger counter flies over the area and finds the highest radiation reading.  (2) Drilling trucks are sent out and core samples are drilled to determine the highest concentration of uranium ore. These core samples are drilled in a grid pattern and every core sample is given a tracking number and logged in showing the concentration and amount of uranium present. (3) The open pit mine is then laid out according to these core samples. When this UFO incident happened, we were about 2 feet away from a layer of hard rock called the &#34;tap rock&#34; that laid directly on top of the uranium ore.   The uranium ore varied in depth from 6 to 18 inches and had about the same brown color as low grade coal.    Two days after this incident, the tap rock was removed to expose the uranium ore.  We were astounded to find that the uranium ore was now a chalky white substance that had NO radioactivity at all!  There was a 250 foot diameter circle of this chalky material in the center of the pit. Outside of the circle, the uranium ore was still as potent as before the incident.  Core samples don&#39;t lie.  This chalky material was uranium before this incident. Many a night I have laid in my bed thinking about what happened.  I think the UFO needed the uranium for some reason.<n>

Everyone stayed still and it was like a freez frame in a movie.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The whole yard got light like someone turned on a flood light overhead and I looked up and saw (1) large Triangle over our head with (1) bright light in the middle. I could move but everyone else stop in mid movement No wind No sound.

I wish I would have written down the date, but when you&#39;re a child - you don&#39;t think to do something like that.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My brother and I were walking to the local convenience store to get some candy about 8:00 PM at night when we saw this odd, shimmering light in the sky across the Santa Clara Valley. It was stationary, the color of magnesium and kind of looked like a mild Fourth of July sparkler sitting there motionless in the sky. It was over the valley low enough that we could see the outline of the top of the mountain range up above and beyond it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Well, we apparently weren&#39;t the only people witnessing this extraordinary aerial phenomena. A small private plane was coming across the sky toward the light to get a better look at it. As soon as the plane was a short distance away form it, the light turned itself off, dimmed itself into darkness. The private plane made a few tentative circles around where the object was and flew off. When it was a short distance away, the object came back on again, shining away in the exact same place.<n> <n><n> <n><n> If this wasn&#39;t enough, apparently this shimmering star like object had attracted the attention of the local Navy P3 Orion subchasing patrol. One of these large military planes came over to take a look - and the same thing happened again! The light went out, the big plane made a couple of large, lazy circles in the area where it had apparently observed the object, and then when it left - on came the light again, in the same place! The next thing that happened about ten minutes or so later, we weren&#39;t quite prepared for. We heard it before we saw it - the military had scrambled a jet from one of the nearby military bases. We heard it before we saw it as it came screaming across the sky. So did the object, and apparently was startled by it. The thing all of a sudden glowed much brighter than it had been (&#34;Oh, no!&#34; ;) and then quickly put it&#39;s shimmering light out again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The jet stayed there for about 20 min. or so, going from wide to tighter and tighter circles, and even doing &#34;figure 8&#39;s&#34;. But, apparently, it gave up the pursuit of the object and we saw the jet fly off - and guess what happened?? The shimmering light came back on again - but this time, it had moved a short distance in the sky to another spot not far from the original one! And , it continued to shine.<n> <n><n> <n><n> During this incredible experience, I had run the two blocks back home and had gotten binoculars. Through them , I had gotten a much better look at this mysterious object. It looked like a glowing pink disc or football shaped object, completely molten, with sparks coming off of it. It kind of reminded me of how an ember glows in the dark. I estimated it was about the size of a passenger car.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The whole incident lasted about two hours, because we were kids and had to go home to bed, and probably got a little bored because the object was just sitting there shimmering and not moving. We didn&#39;t watch it leave, it was still there when we gave up and went home.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I saw it in the exact same place again several nights later, shining away again, but didn&#39;t watch it again that night for very long. No planes seemed to be trying to molest it this time. And then, I never saw it again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My brother and a neighbor lady witnessed this with me. There also had to be witnesses in the private plane, the P3 Orion subchaser plane from Moffett Field NAS, and the pilot of the jet fighter. I haven&#39;t seen anyone else report this sighting, so I thought I would.<n> <n><n> <n><n> P.S. Peter - please use this version - I corrected a few typos. Thanks!<n>

Base shut down in 1979<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was standing Guard duty one night on a top secret base on the Island of Eleuthera in the Bahamas. I had very low level, but very slow moving craft come down island, turn and make an approach towards the gate shack that i was in. It was slow moving and was only at a tree top height. It stopped directly above me and I filed a report to the Officer Of the day, but he would not believe me that it was there. I logged my report in at 2:15 am and stepped outside the shack, and looked up at it which seemed like a couple of minutes, but when I went back in the shack to sign this craft out it was 2:30. I was not sure as to what to make of this, so I mentened this to several people on the base. A couple of days later, I was talking about this, and an Officers wife heard me talking, and she said that she saw it sitting over the shack I was in, but instead of wakeing up her husband, she got afraid and went to bed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I asked everyone who was on watch to look for anything unusual relating to this, and when I went on watch again it came back, but this time I had about 5 people there with me. It came down island again, as it did before and turned towards me at tree top high and approched me, but stopped about 100 yards away, and turned down island again out of sight. This happened 5 times, but only on my duty. It always stopped about 100 yards away and turned down island.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I guess the thing that bothers me the most is that I had 16 section duty, which means that, every 16th day I would stand duty, and it showed up (only) on my duty.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Well, after the 5th time it did not come back until. I was sitting in the shack, and the hair on the back of my neck stood up, like someone was behind me, or watching me,so I walked to the top of the hill where I could see the other side or the island,and there it was crusing along the island at a high rate of speed, about what looked like about a couple of feet off the water.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have had dreans on occasion of a green beam, and I feel I an all knowing feeling knowledge of how this craft is powered.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have more or less kept this to myself, as people who have not experenced this, tend to make you feel like an ass when you bring it up.  ((name deleted))<n> <n><n> <n><n> PS; As I looked below, the craft I saw was a tipical saucer type with the top dome showing a lite that looked like a diamond that you would turn in the lite of day. I have never seen one like it in all the articles and shows about them. I just remember the sound that it made which was like a low pitched sound of wind blowing through a tunnel.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  The date is approximate.  PD))<n>

They claim that they were driving on Route 23 Southbound, right near a reservoir that borders West Milford and Sparta, when they both spotted the object simultaneously. They both give similar descriptions of what they saw. It was an ovular object, the size of a football stadium, hovering about 500 feet above a little mountain due East of the reservoir. It had an external ring of panels of white light, and an internal ring of panels of different color lights. (Red, Yellow, Blue, Green, Orange) Just as they were able to notice the detail, the object shot directly up into the sky, turning into a star sized object, at light speed.

Oklahoma, 1971.<n> <n><n> <n><n> One fairly clear evening (~8:45) at dusk, in the summer of 1971, my brother (11) and I (male, 13) visited our 3 friends [Female(14), female (12) and male (8)], who had relocated from the Houston area the previous summer. We were outside Broken Bow, OK. We were west (~5 miles) and somewhat south of the city and in a very rural area. We were walking north to see their church at night -- an exciting/scary thing to do! The birds had stopped singing and the crickets had not yet started, so it was very quite. I noticed that there were three lights toward Broken bow that were not blinking. I asked if they had any towers out there and they said they didn&#39;t know. And something was mentioned about their living in that particular location (on rural acreage in a mobile home) only since December (~7 months). So we just kept walking toward the church. About a minute or so later, we looked up to see a very large opaque trapezoid (triangle with its head cut off) with three lights. It was moving very slowly toward the sun that had already set. The narrow end of the trapezoid led and the wide end followed. It blocked out the atmospheric haze that was still aglow because the sun was not quite completely gone. It continued westward until it was obscured by the wooded area to the west of us. The lights were as such, two in the front on each corner and one in the north corner only. I do not remember their colors. The amazing thing is that it made no noise. There is no way to be certain of its size/height, although if I had to guess, since I thought the lights were towers, then it must not have been too high, assuming it maintained its height. If it was that height, I&#39;d guess it to be about 1/3 the size of a football field.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was elated to hear about the one in Phoenix in the 1990&#39;s. Although it was chevron-shaped, and had more lights, like ours, it was hovering, expansive and silent. I assume the aliens have changed their designs over the years; either out of boredom or out of necessity, scientific or economic - gotta keep up with the Joneses-Snergabloids.

The object was metal, flat-bottomed, with a sloped dome in the center.  An Air Force jet was in pursuit.  The metal object was at a low altitude, as if it were about to land.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In 1971, when I lived in Spokane, WA, I saw a UFO.  I was finished with my shift as a Registered Nurse at Deaconess Hospital, enroute to meet my fiance.  We planned to see a movie at the Garland Theater on the north end of the city.  It was midweek, a Wednesday or Thursday, and the date may have been 6/10/71.As I drove north up the Monroe Street hill at approximately 3:50 PM (my shift ended at 3:30 PM), I had to put down the sun visor because a bright light was hitting me in the eyes.  When I reached the top of the hill, I stopped for a traffic light.  It was then that I noticed that the bright light was reflecting off a metal flying object that I can only describe as a &#34;flying saucer&#34;.  The surface of the object was metal, the color of aluminum or stainless steel.  The object was round, flat on the bottom, and with a sloped dome in the center.  This &#34;flying saucer&#34; was not high in the sky, but at a low altitude, as if it were about to land.  An Air Force jet of similar size was in pursuit of the UFO at the same altitude and close behind.I thought the jet might be based at nearby Fairchild Air Force Base.When the traffic light turned green, I proceeded on my way and lost sight of the UFO.  I have no explanation as to what it was, only that I have never seen anything like it before or since.<n>

We ran outside and my mother pointed to a field approximately 100-150 yards from our house. About 100 yards above the field, there was hovering a very large, cigar-shaped object. It made a deep humming sound. No engine sound.  The object appeared to be spinning around as it hovered. It was dark gray in color. We were fascinated and continued to watch it just hover in the same spot until it suddenly shot up through the sky and disappeared. My mother sent my brother and I to the neighbors houses to see if anyone else had seen it. All the neighbors whose doors I knocked on refused to open their door which was very unusual at that time. Some of them were very frightened and said through the door that they had not seen anything. We never verified that anyone had witnessed it.  Both my mother and I recall this event clearly however my mo! ther to this day insists she was abducted and then set back down.  I only recall standing in front of it and staring at it for some period of time.  Best guess:  couple of minutes but actual time unknown.  Years later I joined the military and served in Army Aviation.  I spent years on military airfields and never saw or heard anything similar.<n>

I was twelve and he was thirteen. That morning everyone went shopping except us two boys, and am I glad, for I witness something that clear sunny day that I will never forget.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As we played football in the front yard, around 11am a mid-sized metallic saucer with a round disc on top silently floated over top of us at about a 70 degree angle and within 300 to 500 feet in altitude. It was large enough to see clearly but looking straight up at it I didn’t see much except some round opaque portal like windows that you would see in the older type sci-fi renderings of UFO’s.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After a moment of amazement, I asked cousin if he would get a camera, so he hesitantly ran after one. The vessel continued to float silently above me at nearly 90 degrees for maybe a minute or so and seemed to be interested (?). I climbed upon a stump thinking to get a better look at it as I was in a state of astonishment and curiosity.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Cousin came running out of the house with some cheesy little camera that wouldn’t work but by that time it was all over with anyway. Two Air Force jets came blasting over the horizon straight for us and the UFO.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The UFO displayed an amazing ability to accelerate!  Judging by the speed of the jets (I have seen them break the speed of sound and our windows in the 1960’s) I would guestimate that this vessel would have reached a speed of over 1500 miles per hour within a 2 or 3 second burst (more like a highly controlled fling with a bit of a slow start). It looked to me like the jets were at about 600 miles per hour (pretty fast being that low).<n> <n><n> <n><n> The UFO emitted a turbine like sound as it accelerated, but not loud or harsh and as the jets roared past (they were higher and a further away, maybe half a mile) they drowned out any other noise we might have heard. One jet turned around while the other continued the chase which was clear to see that it was a joke. The UFO disappeared into the blue with the jet dogging behind him.<n> <n><n> <n><n> No sooner had the one jet turned around back over the horizon than two more jets screamed over in full sprint the same direction the first jet and the UFO had gone. A total of four jets had pathetically pursued this un-worldly craft. All I can say is our military hardware looked primitive and cumbersome compared to the ability of the UFO.<n> <n><n> <n><n> And just that quick it was all over.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

It was about a half mile away as the crow flies.  The ufo started to move toward us slow it got about 5 to 6 hundred yards away and began to move parallel in front of us.It was about 5 hundred feet high.  My mom thought it was a game warden&#39;s helicopter looking for people spotlighting deer.There was no sound, even at 11 yrs old I knew something was weird.  We called the State Police they put us on hold after we told them what we saw.  No one ever came back to the phone.  While we were waiting on the phone, the light landed behind the trees. Just before it landed, it flashed a bright light. It lit up everything around us that we could see for about 5 seconds. The closest way to describe it is a gas stove.  You think is lit but the pilot light is out and the gas is on -- you light it and it flashes a bluish green light.  It goes poof for a split second.  My mom got scared and we went in the house.  After the flash everything seemed normal.  My mom got a little nervous we went inside and watched though the windows.  We watched for about a half hour or so we never saw it take off. My mom never liked to talk much about it I guess because she could not explain to my satisfaction. As I got older in my late teens and early twenties I hunted that woods.I never found any thing or a landing place.The woods was shaped like a piece of cut pie about quarter of a mile long the deepest part was about 3 hundred yds wide. One time I was there and I was trying to leave I got lost.  You could always hear the traffic to guide you back to the road. But it seemed either I Ihad gone deaf or time stopped.I started to panic a little. I took off in the direction of the road, I thought, but no luck. Then I headed for the field no such luck. Meanwhile at the same time I could not hear any sounds-- birds, any thing. I started to freak out.If you could see this woods you think I&#39;m insane to not find my way out.I sat down by a tree and thought &#34;I&#39;m los! ing my m ind.&#34;  If my hunting buddies found out they would not let me hear the end of this.This is where I grew up it makes no sense at all. Some time went by and I began to hear cars in the distance. I found my way out and I have not been back.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.  PD))<n>

It was the late spring of 1971. I remember it was June as school was just about out for the summer. Not sure of the exact date but it was a Saturday morning. I and two of my friends would always take our dogs out for early morning walks to let them chase rabbits. They never caught any but had a helluva time at it. We were walking three abreast in a southeasterly direction. I was on the right side of the trio. I remember my friend Rick, who was walking in the middle was talking about something, when I heard this extremely high pitched, pulsed humming sound. It was really weird, not loud at all. The way I&#39;ve described it to the few I&#39;ve told this too is that it was kind of like a dog whistle in audible range. For reasons that I do not know I stopped in my tracks and looked up. I saw this &#34;object&#34; out of the corner of eye to my right, out over the hills of the southern peninsula in the bay area. I was now looking west-southwest. This thing zipped, and I mean ZIPPED overhead in a somewhat northeasterly direction, disappearing over the foothills to the east in a matter of seconds. With it went the strange pulsing hum. Suddenly, I heard Rick say, &#34;What are you guys looking at?&#34;. I then proceeded to look forward to where Rick was now standing about ten or so feet further down the trail. Then I looked to my left and my eyes met those of my other friend Craig, who had also stopped in his tracks adjacent to me.. I could tell by the look on his face that he had seen it too! We then proceeded to tell Rick what we had seen. He did not see it but said he remembered the weird sound. The object was circular, kinda dark but was moving so friggen fast little detail could be seen. It left no trail of any kind. The sky was crystal clear and this sighting (and hearing) was very real. It wasn&#39;t swamp gas or a meteor, and it sure as hell was not a plane nor jet aircraft. It WAS an Unidentified Flying Object, period. Had never seen anything like it prior, nor have I seen, or heard, anything like it since.<n>

We say what appeared to be a star about 20 deg. (two closed fists) above the horizon.  This star was blinking on and off, about twice per second. It was as bright as surrounding stars.  Initially, it was not moving, just blinking.  This is was caught my eye, the fact that it did not move.  Had it moved, I would have thought it to be a plane.  But it stayed it one spot for about 15 minutes, never moving.  We wondered what kind of aircraft could stay so stationary.  Even a helicopter would have moved a bit in 15 minutes.  Then suddenly the blinking star instantly moved from its position horizontally about 10 deg.  Then it instantly moved diagonally, then vertically, then one way or another.  It would hold in one position for a few seconds, then instantly move again.  If you imagine a piece of cardboard with many little white lightbulbs randomly mounted on it about one or two inches apart, and wired so you could light individual lightbulbs, and then you randomly light the various lightbulbs every couple of seconds, this would be an approximation of what we saw.  After about 15 minutes of this star jumping about, it moved to about 10 deg. above the horizon and then slowly moved away to the south, moving in the way an airplane would appear flying along, straight and even flight, no longer jumping about.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

I was with a group of men getting ready to go on watch, when a group of seven lights, were observed coming from the airfield control tower, towards our group.  The lights were moving very slowly.  We were able to call the tower and ask if they observed the same.  The answer was yes.  We asked if any weather ballons had been released.  The answer-no.  We then watched the lights come closer, in a serpentine formation, one following the other.  The lights were a red and orange blend, similar in color and shape to a &#34;fat&#34; oval shaped chinese lattern.  There was no noise.  Our group of about 8 men were waiting to go on watch.  The lights appeared to be close to the ground, maybe about 100 feet up, approx. (hard to tell for sure).  When the lights were directly overhead, the turned 90 degrees, and headed straight up and out of sight in about 5 seconds.  Again, no noise.  When we arrived on our watch and asked if our radar or electronic recorders had monitored any activity, the answer was no.  I have not known what to do with this information since that sighting.  I have told others and have heard similar reports of this kind of observation.  I have not seen anything since.  Please advise if any other information exists relative to my experience.<n>

A week prior we had damage to the control room so we rented a 40&#39; mobile home to broadcast out of until repairs were complete.  It was parked about 10&#39; from the back door of the station were the all the power supply were kept.  Back then, the meters had to be read and written down on the hour and half hour. I remember it was 9 pm.  I announced the call letters, put on a 45 record, grabbed my notebook and proceeded out the back door of the mobile home.  As I opened the door, i looked up, then dropped everything I had.  Above the mobile home was a bright cigar shaped object with different colors going all around the outside perimeter of the object.  I could&#39;t tell where one color stopped and another color started.  It was as if they blended perfectly.  No sound was made from the object and if hovered just a few feet from the top of the mobile home.  If I were standing on top, I could have touched it with ease.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It scared me so bad I raced back inside to the mic and made the announcement.  Cars begin to pull down the 100 yard lane off the main highway that lead down to the station which was blocked from the main highway by a tree line.  By this time I had returned outside and had joined the gathering crowd.  At first it moved up slowly about 200 feet and stopped.  Then repeated that same move.  On the third time it went up about 100 more feet and took off at a slant so fast, all we seen was a flash trail from it. Everyone stood still for a moment, then started talking to each other and finally left.  I went back inside and told again what we had seen.  I was told a few days later by three men who came to the  station that it was just a weather balloon.  The local newspaper did a story the next day and that was the end of it.  I know what I saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD))<n>

As young boy playing outside, seen 2 silver round crafts high in the sky, being chased by 2 fighter jets.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was born on March 27, 1959 I cannot remember the exact date, between 1970-1972, I was between the ages of 11 -13. My cousin and I were playing on some foam filled mesh bags, used by pole vaulters, at the local high school football field. It was in the afternoon, a warn partly cloudy day. If I would not have been looking at the sky at the exact time I did I would not have seen them. Laying on my back looking at the clouds ( day dreaming) I seen 2 silver objects, side by side, coming out of this one cloud. At first I thought they were planes? But then I noticed they were round (no wings). So then I thought they were so high in the sky that they appeared round, still thinking they were planes. Then I thought if they were that high in the sky, would they not have vapor trails? Still watching them slowly cross the sky, I got my answer!  Out of the same cloud they had came out of were 2 fighter F4&#39;s (I think) chasing them!  At that time I thought WAIT A MINUTE THOSE ARE AIRPLANES, WHAT ARE THE OTHER 2 ?!!!  I continued to watch as the 2 silver round objects entered another cloud, with the 2 jets following behind them. They both disappeared into the same cloud. Not really understanding what I had seen I rolled over to ask my cousin if he had seen this? He was looking at another part of the sky, and did not see it. Rolling back over and tring to find the exact place they had entered the cloud I seen the same 2 jets flying back out of the cloud the same spot the entered it, heading in the exact opposite direction, as if they lost the 2 silver round crafts in the cloud and were now heading home. I took me 25 years to realize how important this sighting was, to me. I always remembered it but never really thought about the importance of it. I have always been fascinated with ufo&#39;s in fact the reason my Mom said I did not do well in school ( at that time) was I was always thinking about ufo&#39;s and Star Trek !!!!!

When i came home i was in a wheel chair and i told the parents i wanted to sit outside as it was a long time since i was able to be in the sun.. Our neighbor was mowing his lawn &gt;&gt; he was a retired officer from the army. I was soaking in the rays when all of a sudden where i was looking over my parents tri level house was a object hovering just on the other side of there house. I looked at it for a second and i was going to screem out loud so that the neighbor would see what i was seeing but the moment i was going to say saomething he stoped his mower and staired at this object. I said do you see what im seeing ? he responded with yes . the object was about 100 feet in length. it was black in color and was silent. I tried to look for features and i saw tubes protrudeing from the side. i could see there was a sort of heat wave around it at least that was what it looked like. i dont remember any lights but it was as clear as a bell i couldnt have been more then a hundred feet from it.. all of a sudden i watched it go toward portland ore. an in a flash it was gone . No trail no nothing. I asked my neighbor can you please come into my parents house and describe what youve seen cause i didnt want them thinking the VA had given me anything for treatment and i was not seeing what ive just seen. Well thats what i saw and i havent told anyone else but close family im 48 years old now and im not in the best of health so i thought if iam to say anything now it should be soon . i hope this helps you . &gt;&gt;&gt; ((name deleted))<n>
6/1/71 08:00|Albany|GA|Disk|2 minutes|metallic saucer with row of orange glowing windows performed maneuvers  via making upward or downward angles the shot across the sky|2/14/06|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/048/S48716.html|28|ndxe197106| metallic saucer with row of orange glowing windows performed maneuvers  via making upward or downward angles the shot across the sky<n> <n><n> <n><n> On a summer evening in June or July, 1971, my boyfriend and I were en route to a local movie theater in the center of town. There was a naval air station very close to town, so we were accustomed to see various aircraft flying over the town. On this particular night the sun had set and the last few rays were a purple-orange color high in the clouds.  As we remarked on the nice evening, I caught a glimpse of an orange glimmer off the window of an aircraft. At first I thought it was the sun reflecting off a normal aircraft. It was no ordinary aircraft and we stopped in the first available parking lot to observe more closely. To our wonderment, this saucer-shaped craft was performing maneuvers above us!  At first, it simply hovered about the height that a small aircraft would fly - maybe 1000-2000 feet up. It made no engine noise. There was a row of what appeared to be windows completely encircling the center edge (as if two plates were placed together with the inner sides facing each other). These &#34;windows had vertical supports evenly spaced aroung the craft, like plate glass windows. They glowed a deep orange from inside the craft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The last rays of the sun glinted off the edge of the craft. The body was a dark metallic color, darker than a commercial aircraft. It began to move for a total of three maneuvers. First, it tilted at about 30-40 degrees and hovered. Suddenly it shot away so quickly we thought it was gone, only to find that it had moved across the sky at that same angle. It remained at the angle and then began to angle itself in a different direction. This time it moved in short quick motions, reangling itself toward another portion of the sky. It took off and we again found it by following the line formed by the angle from the leading edge. This was all very startling and my hair stood on end. We began to feel that we were truly watching a spacecraft. Within a few seconds more this craft just shot out into the sky and was gone in an instant. I have never discussed this with anyone other that close friends and family. We did, however, call the naval air station to report what we had seen.  Every time I hear of something like this I get chill bumps remembering the night we saw this incredible sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident in 1971 is approximate.

He saw it as it slowly moved right to left at the speed of the old satellites. It sudenly stopped. There was no noise as  helicopter would make. Everything was very quiet. There were no city lights. Then it fell straight down. We were both very quiet and there still was no noise.  Then it started zigging and zagging left and right back and forth up and down. It was still a pinpoint of light--far above english mountain. It stopped again and hovered for about half a minute. Still there was no noise. And then it -zip- went out of sight toward the right in the direction it had come from. My husband and I both asked each other if we had seen what we thought we had seen and did we see the same thing. It was not a flood light or a flashlight--just a bright pinpoint. We have night fished for thirty years and have never seen anything like that since...but my husband has died and I wanted someone the remember what we saw.I can tell you it was stange--We were not afraid of it--But it was eerie--<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

6/1/71 01:00|Holliday|TX|Disk|2 to 4 hours|bright orange glowing saucer shaped object that followed our car|6/12/07|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/056/S56873.html|31|ndxe197106| bright orange glowing saucer shaped object that followed our car<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am writing this report to tell others of the experience I had when I was about 20 years old.  I am now 56.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was a warm summer night up near Wichita Falls, Texas. This town is located in North central Texas, not very far from the Oklahoma border where the Red River separates the two states.  My two friends and I decided to take our 22 caliber rifles and see if we could possibly find some rabbits to shoot at.  I know it sounds cruel, but boys will be boys and I haven’t killed any game in years and have no intention to do so.  We all learn from our mistakes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We got in one of my friend’s car, a Mustang, and drove West past a town called Iowa Park, my hometown.  We continued driving West until we turned onto a Farm to Market road that led to a town called Holliday, Texas.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We again turned West and went down a dirt road that led to a ranch.  The name was posted on a sign there, but it’s been too many years to recall the name of the ranch.  We didn’t find any rabbits, which we thought was odd, but after shooting our three 22 rifles empty into a ravine we decided it was time to go.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was about 12:30 or 1 a.m. at this time.  After traveling back down the dirt road we rounded a hill, and I saw something behind me.  I turned around and there was a bright orange glowing saucer shaped object about telephone pole high over the road directly behind us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I yelled at my two friends in the front of the car and they looked around and saw it too.  My friend that was driving punched the gas and we were literally floating on the rocks of the dirt road trying to get away as we were all so scared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I told him to slow down as he was going to wreck us,  and he did,  and I asked him to shut off the lights of the car.  He was able to do this as there was enough light from the moon to see by.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The orange glowing object was still following us.  I asked him to just shut off the car and see what happened.  We coasted to a stop with the lights off and as soon as we stopped completely, it disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We looked around and it was now over a barbed-wire fence over some property next to us.  It had moved so fast from behind us, it appeared to have just vanished.  We couldn’t understand how it had moved so fast we didn’t see it do so.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I asked my friend to start the car and see if we could slowly move away without it following us, but it continued to move the exact speed that we were traveling as though it was somehow able to match our speed exactly.  Almost as though it was somehow locked onto us somehow.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We again turned off the car.  We talked about getting out and even joked about reloading our rifles  and shooting at it, but no one in that car was about to get out and shoot at it.  We were too scared to even get out of the car.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We got very quite and stopped talking as the realization of what was happening finally sunk in.  We don’t know what really happened past this point.  The next thing we know we felt like we had all been sort of frozen, looking at it for a long time, and the first thing we remember is we all saw it streak away until it was just a speck and then it was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We started the car and drove back into Wichita Falls where we all stayed that night.  I remember that it strange that we didn’t remember talking about it on the way back to town.  We told a few people about seeing it, but of ‘course they all had something to comment on, like what had we been smoking? That night we were cold sober and hadn’t had anything to drink as we never went shooting firearms if we’d had anything to drink.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A couple of days later our local TV station had an interview with an older couple that lived in my hometown.  They told of an incident where the wife had seen an orange glowing flying saucer shaped object over her back yard while she had gotten up to get some water.  Her husband stated he’d had a hard time getting up at his wife’s urgent calls, but he had indeed seen something glowing orange that had streaked off into the distance after he had seen it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I looked over at my step-dad, and he was looking at me and starting to understand the story I had told him a couple of days earlier might have been true.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The one thing we never could understand was it seemed like we were out there a lot longer than we thought we were as it was very early in the morning when we finally made it back to Wichita Falls.  The object never made any noise.  That was one thing that scared us the most.  That, and the size of it.  It was the width of the two lane road including the ditches.  From barb wire fence to barb wire fence.  We figured the orange glow came from it heating up in the earth’s atmosphere.  Traveling so fast through the air.  It looked like two perfectly round plates put together with no sharp angles.  It was round on the edges with no windows or other lights visible.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD))<n>
6/1/71 00:00|UK/England (Devonshire)||Light|30seconds|The light  that shone through the window was an unbeleivably beautiful blue and looked like rays.|12/16/05|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/047/S47865.html|32|ndxe197106| The light  that shone through the window was an unbeleivably beautiful blue and looked like rays.<n> <n><n> <n><n> While laying asleep at home one night in a back room I shared with my sister, I was awoken by a strange noise.  It sounded like helicopter blades, rotating in slow motion.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I woke I was aware of blue light rays shining through the gap in the bedroom curtains.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Scared, I tried to get up to see what it was but as I struggled towards the window the light suddenly dissapeared and somehow, exhausted through fear, I fell back to sleep never mentioning the event to anyone until many years later I related it to my younger sister who also said she had seen it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It is worth noting that the room was situated some 20-25 feet above ground level and the rear wall of the house fell directly into a back alley way.  There is no way that anything as large as a helcopter could have got there and we only had a small courtyard.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Not long before this event I had witnessed a fireball flying over the city in broad daylight sometime in the early evening after school.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.
