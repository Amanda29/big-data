They approached from the west and appeared to be an orange like color.  When I realized they were not aircraft I run inside my house grabbed my video camera and came out and began filming.  The crafted seemed to slow as they came almost overhead. I switched my camera to night vision.  They were silent.  On my video you hear me call for my neighbor Tommy whose party was ending and people where leaving.  You can hear my dog barking and traffic on our street and on a busy boulevard about a quarter mile away.  After watching it now I realized that the &#34;bugs or bats&#34; I referred to was actually a light being emitted and reflecting on the clouds.  The cloud deck was about 700 feet that night.  They flew in each time a little faster and from a more southern origin each time.  They appeared to be translucent which became more evident on a larger screen when the two ca! me in simultaneously.  They appeared to have a dome or a disk on the top of the craft that was not illuminated.  There seems to be an inner globe with a dark spot which gives the appearance of a eye lens; possibly a camera?  Each time they ascended it seemed to be a little further North. I called my partner as it was happening. I shot them using a Sony Handycam set on regular for the first 30 seconds or so and the remainder on night vision.<n>
3/31/13 22:15|Orange|TX|Formation|7 seconds|Fast moving formation of ten UFO's.|5/15/13|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/096/S96888.html|2|ndxe201303| Fast moving formation of ten UFO&#39;s.<n> <n><n> <n><n> April 1, 2013 I usually go outside to stargaze before I go to bed.  Last night was no different.  As soon as I walked outside and looked up I saw a “shooting star” go right over me heading south.  I was amazed at how bright and clear the stars were, this is very unusual here in SE Texas.  I went back inside the house to get my binoculars.   I came back out and was focusing on the star Alnath, in Taurus.  I was facing SW.  This star was just below Jupiter and was very red, it also appeared to be twinkling and changing colors.  Most of the stars appeared to be twinkling and changing colors.   I had just focused on this star when something flew right through my line of sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I immediately looked for it and focused on a formation of ten flying objects flying in a V formation.  They did not have any lights on making them difficult to follow, and they were moving very fast.  I do not know how fast they were traveling.  I counted seven seconds from horizon to horizon.  My “horizon” is within a pool courtyard surrounded by a house.  The objects were travelling   E-NE.  The formation changed from a standard V.  I have attached my drawing for a description.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The colors of these flying objects were very close to desert camouflage (tan, brownish gray).  Their shape was an irregular four sided polygon, with the shorter side being in the front, resembling a triangle with the top cut off.  I could barely make out other shapes and impressions; there is an attached drawing of this as well.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I realize this description is very similar to military aircraft, but here are some differences that stand out.  There was absolutely no sound, except for traffic on the freeway that is about a mile away.  There was no wind that I could tell, and I waited after I could no longer see the aircraft for any mechanical sounds, and there was nothing.  There were no lights coming from these objects, nothing blinking or glowing or spotting.   Finally, my perception of the speed they were moving is faster than anything I’ve ever seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is not the first UFO I have ever seen, it the second I have seen in Texas.  The first UFO I ever saw was in Brussels, Belgium in 1990.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am a 41 year old single mom currently finishing my degree in child psychology.  I live with and help care for my aging parents.  I am not originally from Texas, I moved here from Cape Cod, MA. to be closer to my family.  I have done extensive travelling in my life, and saw my first UFO  while living overseas.  I have been an avid stargazer ever since.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thank you for for providing a forum for me to share my sightings.<n>

The lights were small ovals all the same size the colors were red green and three golden yellow.  They switched colors between them selves. The whole thing was moving at a constant rate in one direction horizontally  but varied from slightly higher to lower over a period of about a minute.  The lights were part of a whole and stacked horizontally one after the other.  I noticed it from a distance above me and slowly got closer until it flew directly over my car.<n>

They were flying west to east.  The first 6 formed a V and ascended into the sky until they could be seen no more. It was a clear night.  The other 14 that followed did not form a V when they ascended but followed the same flight path.  They did not make any sounds. I have never seen anything like this before.<n>
3/31/13 21:42|Kankakee|IL|Cone|5-10 seconds|Super Fast, 22 cal. Bullet Shaped Craft, Huge, Emitting a Very pale light blue color|5/15/13|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/096/S96954.html|5|ndxe201303| Super Fast, 22 cal. Bullet Shaped Craft, Huge, Emitting a Very pale light blue color<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was the first warm night this year, and the sky was very clear, and the alley lights are concealed by my neighbors garage so I decided to look towards Orion’s Belt with my 7x35 color corrected Bushnell binoculars I had been just looking around and I panned left maybe 2 degrees and I saw something really odd.  It was a craft it looked like it was about ¼ inch wide, and maybe 3/8 of an inch long and it was so far out that it was fuzzy looking around the edges, and I know from experience as an ex- USCG base photographer and working with a lot of telephoto equipment that when things are really far away that they have less definition but they have to be damn far away.  To me that means, that this thing had to have been HUGE!  It did not seem to be reflecting light, because the light was evenly distributed across the entire surface, and the color was a very light blue it was like the light was being emitted by it.  The actual shape of the craft was, well it looked a lot like a (22) bullet, but without the rings on the back of it, it was not metallic but more like pale porcelain with this very pale light blue all over it. How fast was it going I have never seen anything move that fast in my life, and I’m 59 I have seen a lot!  This thing moved across what looked to me as a quarter of the night’s sky in about 8 seconds, that is to sa! y one thousand one, one thousand two etc, when I got to one thousand and eight it was gone. It flew in a perfect line and it past just under Orion’s Belt, and from where I was standing it seemed to be between 35-40 degrees off of the Western horizon.<n>
3/31/13 21:00|Fort Bragg|CA|Sphere|5-10 minutes|5 orange orbs seen over Northern California coast March 31, 2013.|4/12/13|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/097/S97045.html|6|ndxe201303| 5 orange orbs seen over Northern California coast March 31, 2013<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was making a food delivery to a house.  As I was coming up the street (heading north) an orange orb in the sky.  Simply, it looked like a fire ball that faded in an out, but moved at a very slow speed (appeared to be decending...and headed in a south westerly direction).  I made the delivery to the customer, and told them to come and see what I was seeing in the sky.   Another orange orb appeared, then another, and yet another. I returned to work, and was telling my co-workers about it.  A fellow co-worker and I were standing outside, when yet another appeared, and we both saw that orange orb together.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This was not the first time, for me, with seeing orange orbs.  I saw them on New Years Eve (January 2013--right after mid-night) as well, with a group of about 9 friends.  We saw a total of 4 that evening.  The orange orbs during the New Years Eve sighting, were moving north easterly, and appeared to be ascending.<n> <n><n> <n><n> peace.<n>

The first night it was in the eastern sky for approximately 1 hr, and then it slowly went up until it disappeared.  It appears to have many flashing lights and stays in the same spot for long periods of time.  I watched it with binoculars and it does not seem to be a helicopter.  It is very bright and at first I thought it was a star.  I have seen the same exact thing for three nights in a row now.  I first noticed it on March 29th, and have continued to see it every night since.  It flashes very bright and seems to have green, blue and red lights. I would just like to know what this is.  On another night I was in the back yard watching it and it looked very low heading towards me.  All of the sudden the lights went out and it scared me because I knew it was there but I could no longer see it.  It made no noise that I could hear.  I became afraid and ran into the house.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Possible sightings of &#34;twinkling&#34; stars??  PD))<n>
3/31/13 20:45|Fair Oaks|CA|Circle|20 minutes|Round orange glowing globes flying over Sacramento skies March 31, 2013|5/15/13|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/096/S96885.html|8|ndxe201303| Round orange glowing globes flying over Sacramento skies March 31, 2013<n> <n><n> <n><n> At about 8:45pm my friend and I went outside to load his ampliphier  and guitars ine his car . As I was going into my house I noticed two lights in the western  sky  heading in a NE  directinpon over my nieghbors  house across the street. At first I thought it was the landing gear lights on an  large aircraft but they were too big and rhad more of an orange hue to them. Iran inside and grabbed my hd camcorder and began filming. As the objects  came nearer they flew at a level altitude and slowed .There was a low clouddeck that night of aabout 700-1000&#39; , the objects where now ove the  house on the right. Ttthey began to go upward very slowly aand appeaared to fade into the clouds. They seemedgto be about 3-5&#39; in diameter. As they came into sightfrom the west  or maybe sw sky they were traveling about 50-80  mph.  Theyslowed  to a  few mph or hoveras they ascended into the clouds . They all came from the same approximate location and went up about the same lo! cation, perhaps a little futher east  each time ..<n> <n><n> <n><n> They were silent.  The closeups look as though they were almost translucent with a faint inner orb inside the larger orb and a nucleous that move around as well giving the appearance of a glowwing eyeball with the top pefectly flat. In some closeups theflat top almost looks like asolid cap of sorts covering thetop of the glowing object. Also on the shot were I am heard saying I see bats or bugs when I reviewedthis on a lrger screen later I realized it was neither. Rather it  looked more like light reflecting off of the clouds aroud it or another layer around it similiar to the glass balls at a science store that you touch and the static electricity makes little lightening strikes. Inside the glass ball. I don,t knowwhat those are ca,lled but they have a large one at our local discovery museum. Itried to pan in and out. Theneighbors you hear at the start are about 100&#39; away. I had trouble seeing my camcorder screen so I unscrewed thespotlight on the garage  and later turned o! ut the porch light. I thout the last one went into the x clouds but it was behind the tree then I realized. It wasn&#39;t and filmed t till it did disappear into the clouds. Sorry my typing I isn&#39;t the best here.  The other witness is my best friend I&#39;ve known for oover 30 yrs. I,ve lived in my home for 13 yrs. This is not  a prank or joke. This was real and I have no explanation of what we saw.<n>

It was shiny and shaped like a football. From the distance I was at, it looked about 1 mile away.  Within about 1-2 seconds it changed shape and started to shrink down to a small black object.  It disapeared in about 8 seconds total time. It seemed to be traveling west and straight.  It seemed to be moving fast as well.  Small planes do not change in shape from a bright reflection round shape to a tiny black object in 8 seconds and dissapear. It was moving fast, then vinished quickly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.  PD))<n>
3/31/13 03:00|Muncie|IN|Triangle|5-10 minutes|Sighting of multiple triangular shaped objects with yellow & orange/red lights moving across the sky near Muncie, IN. 500 Lights On|5/15/13|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/096/S96868.html|11|ndxe201303| Sighting of multiple triangular shaped objects with yellow &amp; orange/red lights moving across the sky near Muncie, IN.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 500 Lights On<n> <n><n> <n><n> Before this sighting, I was a huge skeptic about this stuff. I&#39;m still not sure what these were, but I do know what I saw doesn&#39;t match up with anything I have ever heard of, read about or seen before. I am not an aeronautical expert or even hobbiest, but I can&#39;t get the piture of these things out of my head and have been doing research all day. I came across this website where I have read several peoples&#39; desciriptions of similar sightings and thought I would share my own.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The time was between 2:30 and 3:30 AM. I was catching a ride home from a friend and had some trouble getting into my house that night. I had recently moved away and was back to visit and I forgot to grab a key from my dad. Anyways, my friend offers to let me crash at his place, so we make the 5 or 10 minute drive it takes to get to his place.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We pull up and I grab a couple things from his back seat before we turn and start to head towards his side door. At this point, we are facing East with a full(ish) moon off to our right. I honestly don&#39;t remember who saw them first but there in the sky, traveling in a general north-east direction, are 3 objects moving in perfect synchrination. There appearance was triangular, and they all looked the same. They appeared to have yellow lights on each corner of their respective triangles with an red-orange light in the center. As they traveled we noticed that the formation they were moving in was a giant perfect triangle. The thought occurred to me that we might actually be looking at one distinct object, but they were fairly high up and it was dark enough to make it dificult to tell for sure.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A couple other things of note from this sighting: (1) it was very dificult to determine how fast and in which direction they were heading. I am also fairly certain they were not on a strait course. There appeared to be some back and forth movement in their route. (2) The lead object (or appeared to be the lead), disappeared about halfway through the sighting just as an additional object appeared back towards where we first noticed them. No idea if this additional object was the same object that moved very fast without us noticing or an entirely different object all together. (3) We heard absolutely zero sound coming from these objects even though they moved fast enough that it would be expected if they were using any human technology that I am aware of.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At the end of the day, I still do not know what these things were, but I can say that I much more open to the possibility of there being something else out there that we are sharing this universe with. Hope someone out there has seen something similar and can share some information or at least theories.<n>

Quickly stepped out to balcony and noticed one blinking red light and a white light approximately 30 feet above heading north west at very high speed.  No noise other than the vibration sound when the objects passed over my home.  After about 1.5 min, the white light turned left crossing in front of the blinking red light, then disappeared.  Was unable to see any shape, just the light.<n>

I looked up and 2 bright orange spheres were slowly moving through the sky.  One was very close and the other a bit further away.  They were moving towards the same direction to the southwest and moving upwards into the sky.  The way they moved was unlike any aircraft I have ever seen before as they completely stopped in the distance, moved back in the opposite direction for a minute, then the first just suddenly disappeared.  No fading into the distance, just gone in a split second. Seconds later, the other one disappeared as well.<n>

It wasn&#39;t super high up and it was super lower when this happened.  The speed was pretty fast but not fast enough were I couldn&#39;t keep up with it but it was for sure moving at a good rate.  It never disappeared and as it flew over my car I then looked out my side mirrors to keep track of it. It moved from point A to point B very quickly.   I brought the object to my passengers attention as well and they were shocked! I told them I didn&#39;t see any flashing lights or anything that looked familiar like a plane.   They noticed the same thing I noticed. Like I said this object appeared as fireball with glow of orange and yellow.<n>

Once the objects were directly over head they made no noise of any kind.  They were completely silent, again eliminating the possibility of typical normal aircraft.  Soon after they passed over 2 other orbs/ spheres appeared and also followed the same path.  Once they disappeared, a final orb/ sphere also followed and soon disappeared.  The unidentified flying objects seemed to move at the speed and direction of the wind’s blowing, traveling from southwest to northeast.  When directly overhead it looked like there might be a canopy or parachute above the glowing light, but I am not 100% sure of that.<n>

I was driving along with my boyfriend, when he was telling me of how he saw a large aircraft flying low, that was black with no windows, flew over him last year as we were going downtown to get groceries in Canajoharie, NY.  I then began to look up at the sky, and was observing the stars when I saw what appeared to be a flock of geese perfectly organized.  It happened at 9:23pm.  I then began to examine closer, and it was exactly what my boyfriend saw last year! I pointed to him, and said this one was way bigger.  It was black, triangle shaped, no windows, or lights, and was flying low, and quiet.  It was headed West of us, and moving quite fast.  I started crying because I knew that it was real considering both of us saw it.  I did some research and I believe it was shaped like a stealth plane, but not exactly sure if that’s what it is.  I hope someone can figure it out.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thanks!<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke via telephone with this witness, and she sounded to us to be quite serious-minded.  PD))<n>

I looked to the east.  And then west and when looking back to east while pulling out 3 low flying bright orange appeares moving towards me and no sound was heard. I immediately put truck in park and got out to see what was going on and was very shocked and panicky. I was able to grab my cell phone from within truck and by the time I was able to get pictures the objects had shifted directions and were heading south.  They formed somewhat of a formation and were travelling at high speed with no noise.  No flashing and they appeared to be to look more saucer shaped from my pictures. I took 2 in regular mode and 2.in night mode.<n>
3/30/13 20:40|Azusa|CA|Unknown|1 minute|Many orange lights over the freeway In Azusa CA|5/15/13|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/096/S96890.html|29|ndxe201303| Many orange lights over the freeway In Azusa CA<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was driving on the freeway to work on Saturday March 30, 2013 at about 8:40 pm in Azusa CA, driving at normal speed I came around a turn I could see about a half a mile in front of me in full view many orange lights low in the sky just above the freeway. My first thought is that it was military and that it looked like an invasion or attack just because of the number of orange lights and how low there were. Then I realized that this in no way could be military, there were no flashing red or blue lights that would distinguish one of our aircrafts. The orange lights seemed to be hovering or suspended in mid air but it seemed like they were all moving together at a slow crawling speed. What came to my mind then was the Phoenix Arizona lights in 1997. I had a feeling of fear and amazement I knew that what I was seeing was something amazing. It was so shocking and so incredible that all traffic on both sides of the freeway slowed down drastically (from about 70 ! mph to about 20 mph). I could tell everyone was looking at the lights trying to see what they were. I have never seen anything like this before and it&#39;s hard to explain exactly what I saw because there are no words to explain what exactly was in the sky. I would guess there was approximately 20 lights but possibly more. The lights took up a space of about 1/4 a mile long. At first I thought that each light was an individual aircraft, but the more I looked at the lights I realized that the lights all lined up perfectly and geometrically together, the angles each light were to one another was mathematically prefect, and they moved in unison together that it could mean that this possibly was one huge aircraft in the sky and not many small ones flying in a formation which is what I initially thought. It was flying too low for it to be any aircraft I have ever seen. If I could guess I would say the object/aircraft was about a building&#39;s length high in the sky maybe about 20 or 3! 0 stories up from the ground. I have seen helicopters low but ! this was to big and moved too slow to be a helicopter. Since this object/ aircraft was flying directly over the freeway, and the fact that traffic slowed down so much as we got closer to the object; I was able to look directly up at it from my windshield and I could not see any kind of shape or mass of an object/objects, all I saw was just orange lights suspended gracefully in the sky. So hypothetically if this was one huge craft it was possibly camouflaged with the nights sky. The only other aircraft lights I could see near by in the sky was LAX traffic miles away in the horizon which is visible in Azusa and the San Gabriel Valley. That is the only air traffic close by where planes would be flying low but Azusa is too far from LAX and the path the planes take to land at LAX. I wish I would have taken a picture or video of these lights since it was so close to me and I was driving slow enough to capture it, but my phone camera was not working. So instead I called my boyfriend and wa! s in hysterics telling him that I am seeing the most incredible thing in the sky but I can&#39;t tell what it was and I did my best in the moment explain to him what I was seeing. He was amazed and could tell I had just seen something not only amazing but indescribable. I have already found a video on youtube of another witness who saw what I saw, but they were a bit further from it. I have done research via the internet and have found that Azusa is prone to UFO sightings. I have not contacted the city of Azusa or the authorities about this event, but I might just to see if anyone else has reported the lights that I saw. I am a very open-minded but logical person, but this event is something I have never experienced before and it has really effected me. It has changed my perspective completely about UFO and UFO sightings, I don&#39;t think I could ever forget about it.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

As the appeared to hover, the light diminished in color and intensity.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The two observers were sitting outside on a deck facing north enjoying the early Spring evening.  One observer is a pilot.  It was just starting to get cold.  One observer saw the lights approaching from the East and we were surprised there was no noise associated with the movement of the lights.  And no flickering red or green lights.  Only an oragne glow.<n>

At approximately 20:20 PM I looked up and noticed a bright yellow / orange light moving from the Northwest to the Southeast.  I noticed it when it was above our location.   The light was very bright, much brighter than any surrounding stars and much brighter than the landing lights on a commercial airliner.  It did not blink, but had a slight flicker.  We also did not hear any sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As it passed our location, at about 45 degrees from the horizon, the light began to fade and we could not see it any longer.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Approximately 8 minutes later another object of the same color and brightness passed overhead and followed the same direction as the first. It too faded as it approached the horizon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.  PD))<n>

It was zigzagging back and forth and that is what caught my attention.  I had a camera with me that had a high power zoom on it and I took several photos where I could see no visible object at the beginning of the vapor trail, but this thing was moving fast and was now headed north overhead.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I pulled over and took several photos and it almost seemed to change shapes in flight.  It seemed to have a double vapor trail coming off of it and it continued to curve sharply one direction and then the other.  In some of the photos it looked like one giant group of rocks and then in others, you can see a ghostly transparent image of what looks to be a large airliner, but why would it be zigzagging sharply at speeds fast enough for a double vapor trail?  It seemed to have no less than 4 different shapes in 4 pho! tos taken just moments apart.  Then it was gone.  I looked back to the south where it had come from and the original vapor trail was fading away as they do, but I took one last photo of it to show the zigzag motion it had.  When I got home and looked at the photo on the computer, I see the craft was back in the southern sky just starting to leave a new vapor trail in the top of the last photo I took.  I didn&#39;t see that one until I noticed it later in the photo.  If it was the same craft, it would have had to do a 180 degree turn and move very fast to get back to that part of the sky by the time I took that last photo.<n>

I continue to vacillate between thinking im crazy to thinking i really saw what i saw. so around seven thirty i reported a starlight point moving, then two orbs glowing and moving across the sky.  i then proceeded to watch and lay in my backyard. the first one i saw included 4 orbs. it was in a v shape. then i saw   three points of light intersect in and out, going from three points of light to one point of light. this one was the most uncomfortable to watch because at one point it got very close. after an hour of watching the final point of light remain stationary, i saw the same double orb shape from earlier in the night fly over head three more times. coming from the same direction. then another hour goes by and i see two points of light like stars dancing around one another and then they both went off in different directions. as im bringing in my blanket (by this point i had made camp in my backyard) i see the final o! ne. as if to say goodnight, just as i head inside i see a solitary point of light like the first one move slow, even across the sky and dissapear into the halo of the moon. not two min later a plane with a chem trail behind it shot of in the same direction pretty fast (the plane was clearly illuminated by the moon) overall im pretty intrigued and plan on looking again tonight.<n>

Can only be seen through camera Lens!<n> <n><n> <n><n> Just after 6:30 this morning, March 30 2013, I went to the usual spot (North San Fernando Valley, facing south/southeast towards Burbank and downtown L.A.) from where I watch the sunrise whenever I can. With that said, I have been there many times and have seen many interesting things, but nothing quite like this.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I started recording video on my iPhone 3S, because I had forgotten the batteries to my digital camera.  I figured why not give it a try especially since I had recently listened to an interview discussing the abilities of digital cameras compared to the human eye.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first, I filmed a quick, less than 30 second video and remembered I had my Samsung camera in the glove box and stopped recording on the iPhone.  But, before grabbing the other camera, I noticed the screen image displayed after the video was finished saving.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At about the center of the frame, set against the morning blue sky, was a light blue, rectangular/square shape.  It clearly stood out and was not common or normal.  After that, I just stuck with the iPhone.  I tried to capture it from different angles, moving the camera back and forth, trying to satisfy the doubts in my own head.  I compared the view from inside the car through the windshield to an unobstructed view outside.  Nothing changed.  The object never moved or changed appearance in any way.  That was until I looked at it with my own eyes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When not looking at the screen, I could not see the object at all.  I kept going back and forth looking at the screen, then with my own eyes.  It was quite remarkable.  Like in the movies when a vampire cant see himself in the mirror hes standing in front of.  I am certain, without a doubt in my mind, what is seen on the video is not and cannot be a glitch or glare or fragment of something floating around in the air.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Im then narrating what Im seeing (not seeing) and the object virtually disappears!  After watching the video, to me at least, it looks as if the object had been sucked away at light speed.  Almost immediately after, the closest street lamp shuts off.  This, of course, created all kinds of questions and doubt in my mind.  These were dismissed after I opening the video in an editor.  When looked at frame by frame, it is clear that the object leaves before the light is turned off, which would indicate that the light was not the source of the “rectangular” object.<n>

They were close enough to appear large to us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As they hovered away, they got smaller until they disappeared.  Another one then showed up and disappeared.

I live next to a lake which is quite dark and deserted around the late evening.  As i was walking my dog along the water i noticed a large light in the distance but ignored it thinking that it was a helicopter with the spotlight on, possibly looking for a criminal and i also saw what appared to be a plane chasing or observing its actions.  As i continued walking, i noticed clouds moving in fairly quickly around the sky but wasnt bothered by it because it was coming in fast but not too abnormally fast.  There was also one rather large dark cloud that began to cloak the moon so it became eclipsed, but you could still see a glow around the cloud.  i found this strange because when i began my walk, there were only a few clouds but soon began to look like a light fog or mist.  As i got towards the end of the trail next to the lake, my dog decided to urinate on a plant as he normally does. Usually wh! en my dog has to stop, i take my time to enjoy my music and stare at the sky and the stars. As my dog urinated, i looked up at the sky and saw the light again but this time it wasnt as far into the distance as before, but still relatively far away.  I stared at the light and tried to determine what it was, and noticed it had a spherical shape with a glow around it.  The light made a slow and small left to right motion and hovered there and then bolted past the trees and dissapeared, i am not sure if the object emitted noise because i was listening to music but a couple seconds before i noticed the light, my phone lost reception but this only lasted a few seconds then returned to normal still before i had noticed the light. This could not have been a comet because the sky was cloaked with clouds at this point and you could barely see the moons glow past the dark clouds and this light was bright and too large to be a comet. I also thought it could be a missile, because of the ! recent threats made by north korea but a missile could not hav! e made t hat left to right motion and just hover. This could not have been a plane or helicopter because of the speed it was traveling as it left, it was going at the rate of shooting star; possibly even faster. Prior to leaving my house, i heard rain outside my window for about less than 5 minutes, as well as 2 or 3 car alarms going off but am not sure if it ties into the sighting. after seeing this light, i ran home out of fear and panic along with my dog.

3/29/13 23:30|Lexington|KY|Circle|~10 minutes|Two red/orange orbs moving south to north over east side of Lexington, KY; no sounds|5/15/13|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/096/S96834.html|44|ndxe201303| Two red/orange orbs moving south to north over east side of Lexington, KY; no sounds<n> <n><n> <n><n> At approximately 11:30 pm EDST (23.30) on the east side of Lexington, Kentucky, on March 29, 2013: My small dog was agitated at the back door, barking excitedly, which is uncharacteristic for her. When I went to see what the matter was, she was excitedly indicating that she wanted to go outside. Normally she will just sit at the door patiently waiting if she wants to go outside.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I let her out, and followed onto the back deck as she descended the steps into the back yard. It was at that point that I noticed a red orb hovering stationary slightly to the north of me, high in the sky. It was too large to be the red wing light of an airplane. It did not move as I observed it for perhaps 30 to 60 seconds. I went inside to get my iphone in order to take a picture, and it was still visible when I returned, but had started moving very slowly in a northerly direction.  I took pictures and a short video (or thought I did; this morning those pictures and video do not appear on my phone, but two others, taken later from the upstairs deck are on my phone.)  My wife had already gone to bed, so I went upstairs to our bedroom, woke her up and told her what I was seeing. There is a second floor deck off our bedroom, and we went there, where the object was still clearly visible, continuing to slowly move in a northerly direction.  I then saw a second identical object which was much closer to us, but about the same apparent altitude, moving south to north. This second object was slightly to the west of us, but nearly overhead. It was moving slowly toward the location of the first object. When we looked back to the last location of the first object, it was no longer visible.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We watched the second object move very slowly—much too slowly for a fixed wing aircraft—in the same south to north trajectory. Eventually the second object disappeared as we watched. It did not go off into the distance, it just disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The apparent size of the objects was the same. My recollection is that at the first sighting of the second object it was about the size of a dime held at arm’s  length. My wife’s recollection is that it was larger, i.e. about the size of a quarter held at arm’s length. We agree that the apparent size was smaller than a full moon. The moon, at the time, was far east of these objects, which were high in the sky as opposed to near the horizon. Unquestionably these objects were not stars, both because of size and the fact that they moved.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As to color, I saw both objects as being red. My wife saw them as being orange, although she also saw what appeared to be a small red “dot” in the center of both objects. I did not observe this “dot”.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Regarding photographs: This morning I looked at the photos on my camera. To my great surprise, there was no video whatsoever, and only one still shot of one of the objects. It appears to be the second one, due to it’s apparent size in the photo. The photo was taken at full zoom on an iphone 5. When the photo itself is enlarged, the object does not appear to be an orb at all, but rather appears to have a crescent shape, with curve on the bottom, but with the top tilted slightly to the west. Upon closer inspection, we thought it appeared to have a “saucer” shape, with the bright crescent being at the bottom. It is also possible the impression appears because of something which may be the “red dot” appears above the crescent. I have not magnified the photo beyond what I can do by zooming into the photo with the iphone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The color of the crescent in the photo is much more white than the appearance of the color to our naked eyes. As I said, I would call it red, although tending toward an orange-ish red as opposed to bright red, while my wife says the color was orange with a “red dot”.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The other photo is completely black, as if only a picture of the night sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am baffled as to why there are only two still photos on my phone from last night, and no video whatsoever. I am certain I shot both, downstairs as well as upstairs. My wife thinks that I may have failed to properly take the shots due to my excitement, but I disagree. I clearly recall both the action the phone does after taking a still shot, as well as seeing the video icon active.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At no time was there any sound heard from these objects, at least by we humans. It may be that the dog heard something which caused her agitation.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Backgrounds of the observers: I am an attorney. My wife is a dental tech. I am in my early 60’s; my wife is in her late 50’s.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The light started to rapidly descend towards the horizon line and then became stationary. I pulled over on the side of the road and started to record it with my phone camera.  The light started to slowly pulsate from bright to dim, this lasted for about 5 minutes.  The light then faded away completely and did not come back. The light was towards the East.<n>

The fact that it seemed to move slightly brought my attention to it.  No other stars could be seen, as the clouds were making the night very dark. Looking at the moving light I first thought that it was an illusion so I put my glasses on and saw that there were some flashing lights on the object.  I decided to take a closer look with my Fujifilm Finepix and zoomed 18 times closer.  What I saw was a bright moving object that was intermitently flashing red, green, and blue.  I took a video on the same camera and even though the quality isn&#39;t the best, we clearly see the colors changing. I don&#39;t know how long it stayed there but I noticed that it had moved a little further and after about 5 minutes I could hardly see it as a tree&#39;s branches were in front of it. I told one of my friend over the internet and I moved away from the window but kept having a glance to make sure to see it if it would be moving. About a minute after I stopp! ed watching it, I went back to the window and notice that it was gone. I looked everywhere around in the sky but I didnt see any other light that was looking like that one.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Twinkling star??  PD))<n>

I noticed that it was a bright orange glowing light that was lasting much too long to be a shooting star.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After watching it for 30 seconds or so, I started recording it with my cell phone.  I video taped it traveling from the south east towards the north west. After video taping it for 2 minutes or so, the orange light began to blink and faded out. Immediately following it fading out, another one appeared over the tree line at the same exact spot the previous one started. 3 more orange lights followed in the same exact line.<n> <n><n> <n><n> While traveling in the same direction, the lights appeared to be swaying or moving in a faint zig-zag line.  In other words, they appeared to not be traveling in an exact straight line.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The lights were brighter than stars but not brighter than the moon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Airplanes were flying during the same time frame and this showed us there was a! clear difference in the airplanes and the orange glowing lights,<n>

As me my girlfriend Holly and friend Rich finished assembling of our unborn child’s crib.<n> <n><n> <n><n> All three of us went outside to say goodbye to Rich, as Rich stepped down the stairs and off the stairway leading to the apartment he noticed something in the sky that was unfamiliar. So he called me off the porch down the steps to see as well.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As my friend Rich fumbled with his phone to video this amazing event, I step off the porch solid onto the pavement soon after Rich, I immediately looked straight up into the sky and the first thing that I saw was about four glowing, almost egg oval, orange red objects  in the sky above all four Illuminating, three in a row and one on the side accelerating quicker than the others moving towards the front of th! e others and eventually 5 or 6 seconds later to lead what it appeared to some sort of straight line formation.  They also made no noise at all like it was a defining moment in life were everything goes silent until that special event is over. A second after witnessing that I my girlfriend and Rich are all now on the pavement observing this breathtaking and phenomenal event witnessing at least 6 more UFO’S behind  the first group in a less organized way than the first four.  After two minutes into observation of this event, my girlfriend called her mother, sister and brother in-law witness this event as well.  As we all observed the UFO’s in the night sky for about 2 ½ to three minutes Rich finally got the video up and started recording the night sky while the UFO’s passed through at a very slow pace almost as the speed of a blimp illuminating an orange-red fire color as they go.  These UFO’s had a very low altitude &amp;lt;as if I can reach out and touch one&amp;gt; they were moving g! eometrically perfect traveling SE. As these UFO’s slowly moved! about w e all talked and enjoyed the beauty of or neighbors getting out for an ole stroll in the park –it was beautiful and enlightening. When the UFO’s started disappearing out of sight their altitude went higher from a straight line and then a swooping upwards motion off the straight line altitude up and out of sight like they went through some kind of door or something because they vanished into thin air. This whole event was about 5 to 6 minutes from initial sight of the UFO’s, taking place in SE Gainesville approximately between 8:45pm and 9:05pm on 3/29/2013.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I hope that someone can explain this event, because this event was way out of the ordinary.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thank you for taking time out to view this report hoping that it’ll be helpful and enlightening to some, thanks once again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Sincerely, ((name and e-address deleted))<n>

The lights, about 15 in number, were orange in color and appeared to be a horizontal light source.  They were brighter than the north star and seemed to be a few times larger than the north star from my vantage point.  They DID NOT flicker, twinkle, or flash, but seemed to emit light much like a candle, but horizontally.  They were randomly spaced and moved slowly across the sky in what seemed like a non-changing formation, and did so in approximately a west to east direction.  I CAN NOT SAY that I saw any vehicle, aircraft, or any type of objects, just light sources.   Actually, I do not recall hearing any sound coming from that area of the sky.  I did not view that lights with any type of visual aid.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I drove to my home which is approximately a 2 minute drive from church hoping to show the lights to my wife.  Though the lights had almost passed through our area by the time I got home,  I expected that my wife would at least get a quick look at what I had seen. But, by the time we exited our home, the lights were gone. Unfortunately, I can not report on how that final departure happened.<n>

PD))|5/15/13|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/096/S96828.html|57|ndxe201303| They are seen tuesday through thursday 20:00 to 3:00 every week.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first I was afraid to say anything for fear of becoming a casualty in case it is something you already know that I now know too. I have been extremely careful not to tell anyone. They probably wouldn’t believe me anyway.  Now I am afraid not to contact you.  In the last year the numbers of these things have increased.  Some nights I see 8 or more of them. I solemnly swear not to tell a soul about this.  As then I would be in danger of knowing too much. If you guys already know, I don’t want to know any more about it. I know Phoenix is a hub for drone testing but a drone or a satellite would not unnecessarily waste that much of its own energy to make a light show. Please come and take a look for yourselves. I bought a 100x telescope and it did not increase the size. They are geosynchronous and move with the horizon.  They are seen in the east rising and the west descending. The light they emit is way brighter than stars. Like a planes headlights as it is approa! ching. And they go through the spectrum of colors of visible light in a second’s time. Like a rotating prism being backlit. They also appear to be rotating which may mean they are emitting a frequency around 24 to 25 Megahertz. The scan rate of my camera is about 24 Mhz. Because they are rotating the frequency is ahead or behind the scan rate on my camera. My cheap video camera is not good in low light and cannot see stars but through experiments and adjustments I have got some pretty good images. In the best one where it is enlarged although blurred it just simply disappears on camera and I did not block the lens either but it was still there to the human eye. It is my theory that they are farther away from earth than the moon but that they are watching us and have technology a million years advanced than we have. I also think they have a way of cloaking when we get too close. I also think you guys have technology that is way advanced of what the public knows but not this ! advanced and not this powerful. May I suggest contacting NASA ! and perh aps HUBBLE to examine them using x-ray, infrared, sound waves, radio waves, microwave and non-visible frequencies.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I will wait for an email that is legitimate and not phishing or from a free email and will not respond unless it is from your guys.  I have only contacted you guys anyway.  I also solemnly swear to erase all data I have to protect myself and our country. I know nothing. Please email me and I will send the Videos. And you are always welcome to come here and see them for yourselves. R.S V. P.  They have a regular schedule and are more visible on crest and new moon nights usually Tuesday through Thursday between 8 pm and 10p, And 3am new ones appear.  Sometimes I can see them in broad daylight too, that is how powerful they are.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Kindest Regards Mr. --------- in Maricopa, AZ. P.S. I will gladly reveal my identity and want someone to come here and see these things.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We will encourage the witness to get photos.  PD))<n>

They flew right over head and some pausing for a moment.  Then they began to fly around together in the eastern sky forming some kind of shape or symbol and holding that formation for a few minits.  Then they began to seperate and continue in a south east direction until they began to vanish one by one turing invisible.  It was a clear night sky.  I recorded the event by cell phone but proved to be poor visibility and not doing justice to what we actually saw.<n>

They stayed in view, ascending slightly until they finally just faded out.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The event was observed from my automobile as I was driving to work,  between Kellyton, AL, and Goodwater, AL on US Highway 280, about 10 miles west of Alexander City, AL. I was able to keep the objects in view for four minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The day was clear, with scattered high cloud. I was driving in a northwesterly direction, and the objects appeared at my 2:00 position moving north to south. They were are very bright white, and were cylinder shaped. There were no wings or other control surfaces I could see.  They did not have the silhouette of rotary winged aircraft, appearing to be long and slender, rod like in their appearance. They were making a broad westerly turn, and ascending very slightly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Their position to each other remained constant, one was slightly above and behind the other, as shown below:  _________________________  _________________________  I observed them almost continually for four minutes; I was driving and did have to be aware of road conditions.  They finally just faded out, for lack of a better term at about my 10:00 position.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I grew up near and live Fort Benning, GA, and am familiar with most contemporary aircraft and helicopters.  That’s not what these were.  I also moved my head around as much as I could, to make sure they weren’t reflections in my car’s windshield.  They weren’t.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They appeared to be close, I would say two miles or under, and were under 5000 feet  altitude. I have good vision, and as a result of my job I am a trained observer.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What struck me was the fairly slow speed, and brilliant whiteness of these objects, and the fact they faded away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke via telephone with this witness, and he seemed to us to be an exceptionally good witness.

My friend was outside smoking a cigarette around 11pm while talking on his phone when he spotted an orange object just under the full moon, following a straight trajectory across the night sky. 5-10 minutes later the exact same thing happened and he ran inside yelling for me to come outside to see it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It obviously resembled an orange flickering flame, circular in shape.  It was about 1/10th the size of the 11pm full moon, silently crossing the sky, heading from our perspective due north.  I expected the object to get smaller, like a glass balloon with a flame inside it, drifting up into the night sky.  This however was not the case.  The object stayed the same size, traveling a straight line, and appeared to be around airplane altitude or possibly outside of the atmosphere.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It&#39;s hard to grasp an object traveling at such an altitude yet having a magnitude perfectly visible to the naked eye, it would have to be of astronomical size.  It did not look like reflection, it looked like a bright circular orange flame.  It took a little more than a minute for it to travel behind the skyline.  My friend confirmed that the first one followed the exact same trajectory.  We were both sober.  This is baffling and so far defies explanation.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is flawed.  We assume that the date of the sighting was March 28, 2013, and we have amended the date to reflect that assumption.  PD))<n>

I was relaxing in a recliner chair, looking up at the Night Sky, as I do frequently, especially when it’s clear and moonless outside.  A cylindrical-shaped transparent bright blue-gray light appeared at the top of the Big Dipper,  It caught my eye and began spiraling downward moving toward the center of the Southwestern sky at a consistent speed that was easy to follow.  As it moved closer it started to make a silent wide circle above the tall trees in the neighborhood. I then began to feel an energy in my body as it made a left turn and started to speed up which propelled me to spring from the chair to follow its trajectory.  At that moment I almost tripped over our dog,who had also transfixed himself on the sky above. In an instant the light disappeared and the energy shift was palpable to me and my canine friend. He was panting and I felt breathless for a few moments.<n> <n><n> <n><n> No other additional aircraft were visible or audible during this event, although it had been about 5 minutes prior to this when a strong passing thought inside my head registered how remarkable it would be to witness a UFO in my lifetime. Was this a coincidence or a premonition, I’ll never know, but I pulled myself together and excitedly called my wife long-distance at her childhood home in Bethesda, Maryland  where she was staying while taking care of her 93 year old Mother.  It was after midnight her time and the call awakened her, but she could tell from my voice that I wanted to relate what had just happened for a kind of verification, while it was still fresh in my memory.  My heart was still pounding as I told her the story, then I wrote down this account immediately after we spoke.<n>

As I ran outside, I looked up and saw a large black object that seemed to have been twice the size of my home, with two red lights on it one on the right front side the other the left rear, it continued to move slowly northeast  I don’t recall seeing a shape I sort of froze and starred in disbelief.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then my wife said lets fallow it we jumped in the car and tried to fallow it when we got to the street it was gone we circled the block couldn’t find the object so we came home.<n>

This circular formation of orange colored lights seemed to hover for a while in the distance. I watched this for about 30-45 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I thought maybe they were helicopters, the way they were stationary in the sky, but there was absolutely no sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I then went into to get a camera.  My camera was not charged and when I returned the lights had dissipated.<n>

Assuming this was a helicopter, I started watching more closely, wondering why a helicopter was coming so close to us, as we sit up on a hill, with a broad view.  The craft slowed and came to a stop, somewhere above the freeway, as it appeared to me.  It didn&#39;t turn, the lights didn&#39;t flash, it just stopped, for approximately 4 or 5 seconds, then moved to the north east, closer to us, then stopped again.  At this point, we scrambled to get up and go outside, cameras, etc.  It took us several seconds to do that.  We got out side and watched this light.  There was no sound, although if it had been a plane or helicopter of that size and location, we w! ould normally hear it.   It was large, appearing much larger than stars normally appear.  There was a light cloud cover beginning to move in, and ultimately, the stopped craft seemed to disappear behind the clouds as they closed in on it.  The clouds seemed rather opaque as they covered it, although it otherwise appeared to be very light cloud cover, that I would have assumed that you could have perhaps seen such a bright light through.  Interestingly, the camera would not focus in on whatever the object was, which was unusual, I frequently take pictures of the moon, bright stars, planes, etc.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Any aircraft flying over my home are easily identified because they are, at that point, flying very low.  I could not make out the shape of the craft, save for the formation of the lights.

They noticed the objects first while standing on the porch; meanwhile, I was digging in the trunk.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Finally, I happened to hear their call to &amp;quot;look up&amp;quot;....none of us have ever seen anything like it.  This is the middle of town...they werent very luminous (could barely get them on camera)...but glowed with an orange fireball look....slowly moving across the sky a little faster than a balloon floating. Low altitude....silent. We watched the two objects- one following the other- as they flew overhead going west. No distinct &amp;quot;shape&amp;quot; other than a spherical w/ fireball aura that we observed as they flew over us. Have been wondering what they were ever since.<n>

Left for about two hours and when we came back I noticed it was still there, my binoculars revealed a spherical shape with a very bright red flashing light on the bottom and green and yellow/white lights on top.   It stayed there for several hours and we went to bed.  The following night it was there again, it hung there for several hours and was gone.  Couldn’t judge the distance it was out but best guess would be a few miles.  Checked on the log here and was surprised to see no one else reported it.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It did not look or sound like an airplane or helicopter.  It was silent and quick, I don&#39;t know what I saw.<n>

Similar to a constellation they held in formation essentially, just weaving side to side in tiny little movements. The four lights were in almost a right angle triangle, hypotenous on the left, and one more above the triangle.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I called my mom immediately because this looked the same as some things id seen on the internet. I told her &amp;quot;look UFO! UFO!&amp;quot; and they started flickering and vanishing from top to bottom. One by one all of them dissapeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Not long after i saw what appeared to be an army jet fly over my porch toward were the lights were.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was looking southwest from Maple Ridge, BC Canada, when i saw them, the whole thing lasted maybe four minutes in total.

It came down falling from the sky looking towards the West. It was similar in nature to a shooting star or meteorite sighting. Although there were a few major differences that certainly made it very easy to distinguish that it was not a meteor sighting. I have seen many meteorites and this certainly was not. Indeed it did look like a teardrop shape. It resembled the teardrop type ornaments you might see on a Christmas tree. I saw this with a friend. We were both sitting in our vehicle. Immediately upon seeing this the both of us went into shock.  I screamed out something about it as did my friend at the same instant.  The object moved very slowly. It moved about triple the time slower than a typical shooting star would. The object was also incredibly bright. So bright that it lit up our surroundings. It kind of reminded me of when I have shot tracer rounds out of a rifle. Except this object was much slower! . It appeared to be dropping down in elevation. Unlike a shooting star that would move across the sky. This object came down from the sky. We both then proceeded to discuss what we had just seen. We both had exactly the same impression and feeling that this certainly was not a meteor. We both felt that this was not normal. We both felt that we had just seen something very special. I have a background that involves me being familiar with all kinds of aircraft. Military and civil. 5 minutes after we witnessed this a aircraft did come into the area. It was indeed a military aircraft. The aircraft had its navigation lights turned off. It turned them on and then back off. I do not believe that we could have been the only 2 to experience this. Even though it was 3:29 in the morning I am sure somebody else must have been awake in this area. It could not possibly be missed. It was just so bright. I came here to report this in the hopes that somebody else saw what we saw too. Or per! haps somebody may have some insight into what we saw. Thank yo! u for re ading.<n>

Earlier I was admiring the huge bright moon while it slipped below the tree line.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I was taking a pill I looked up and saw 2 lights, shaped oval, hovering over an old Bomarc missile base about a mile or so to the Northwest, just appear out of the darkness.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They just hovered there for about a minute not changing color or shape.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I awoke my wife to see these lights, and just as she moved to see out the window they started moving to the East.  They made no noise and the clear white light just kind of flickered slightly.  They moved off to the east from the point I first saw them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Now I am a pilot with over 1200 hours in my log book and, who&#39;s father was a navigation tech. With both the USAF and with the Federal Aviation Admin.

As i said earlier, there was no sound at any time.  The lights were about 2 to 3 football fields apart from the time the appeared until they moved out of my sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I see aircraft flying over and around home most every day.  BIA is the home of the 101st air refueling wing, flying KC 135 Stratotankers, which make a huge noise on take off and cruising overhead.   Also we have a helicopter unit stationed here, flying UH 60 Blackhawks, which are also noisy.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The lights approached no closer than  2 football fields near me.  I saw no other lights or aircraft in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was very bright orange and large.  &#34;Wow,&#34; I said.  &#34;It looks like a planet or something.&#34;<n> <n><n> <n><n> I then went to the bathroom, where I was when she suddenly called me back in.  A!  Come in here, quick! It&#39;s moving!&#34;   I looked out and, indeed, it was moving across the sky in a northeasterly direction, very bright and steady.  I got chills down my spine, as it had been totally stationary just moments before.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Within 3 minutes, the event was over and the light had passed out of our sight.<n>

They were very still in the sky and were too high to be towers and too low to be stars.  They eventually began moving in a direction over mt house and toward the moon.  The red one was first and began moving quite quickly and once it passed overhead,  itded into a kind of blue-gray.  And evidently went even faster because it appeared to shoot up and last the moon until it was no longer visible.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I looked back at the orange-yellow light, it had also began to move in the exact same direction. It did the exact same thing but its color stated the same and it shot off just a bit before the place that the first light did.  Neither made any sound that I could hear.<n>

I exclaimed WHAT IS THAT!  My 13 yo son stopped playing his tablet and looked at  the object and said &amp;quot;Wow that is weird&amp;quot;…  As we drove down the street the object stay pe! rfectly still until we drove out of view.  My girlfriend who was driving could not see the object as it was above the passenger side of the vehicle.  She asked if I wanted to turn around and go back but my fear of being spotted trumped my curiosity.....  After seeing it I drew a picture of it  which I can email to you as we&#39;ll as a map diagram where this took place.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On March 30th the object was spotted again approx. 11-1130pm in Waldorf Maryland on English Oak Court.....This time the object flew overhead near the house off a friend of mine. I was not witness to the second event, but my friend that lives there witnessed the craft with two others. I&#39;ve known this man since 5th grade and I&#39;m a 31 yo man and he doesn&#39;t lull pranks or lie about these types of things.....<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;m writing this to whom it may concern because Waldorf Maryland may currently be a UFO Hotspot...Learning about Space a technology is a hobby of mine and I fully believe in life on other worlds but these craft could be secret military craft just as well as other worldly vehicles. I have very little knowledge of MUFON but you may have more resources than me to be able to catch footage of one of these things..<n> <n><n> <n><n> I would like for my friends, family myself to remain as anonymous as possible but I am willing to respond via email or phone of any inquiries, until then I will try my hardest to get a picture of this object, because it isn&#39;t just lights in the sky...<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thank You<n> <n><n> <n><n> Sent from my iPad<n>

I heard a weird noise getting louder outside my window to the north. I cannot describe the sound (it was something I have never heard before - maybe like a machine) but it got louder over the music I was playing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I immediately got out of bed to turn the music off so I could figure out this sound I was hearing. I got up out of bed, the sound stopped, I was now facing my other bedroom window to the south (all blinds were closed).  As soon as the sound stopped, I saw brilliant white flashing lights outside my window.  It was like 50 strobe lights turned on for about 5-10 seconds. The only word I can describe this would be &amp;quot;spectacular.&amp;quot; Everything happened so fast and the brilliance of these white lights seems unearthly to me...<n> <n><n> <n><n> I called two police stations in the morning to see if there were any reports of this unusual phenomenon, but there were none reported. I cannot imagine no one seeing this display of flashing lights, although it only lasted for 5-10 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am making this report to see if anyone else experienced this occurrence...<n>

It flew directly over us. I could make out what it looked like.  It was oval shaped, ball of light in the middle, it looked like the ball of light was the cockpit.  The front stuck further out from the middle. The back was almost flat with very dim exhaust.  The back was also orange.  After it flew over a second one followed 30 seconds in between.  They were dead silent.  When one got closer to the other they got brighter and took off. I then rushed home to look out my backyard. When i did i saw the same two orange lights head to the other side of my lake.  They then descended into the forest for about 3-5 minutes.  Then one of them flew back up and hovered there for another 5 minutes.  Then i look to my left and see another one descend from some clouds.  It was flashing orange, green, blueish purple, and then went only orange and shot across the sky and joined the other lights. They star! ted doing figure eights, coming in close the n spreading really far apart over and over again. Then going up and down and changing places with each other.  Then i see what looked like airplanes and or helicopters head that direction and the lights take off in a second with a trail of light behind them.  I saw this same thing when i was a little kid. I was standing on the sidewalk with a  friend and heard a screeching noise.  We looked up to see a bright orange light coming down right above us.  It then sat there quietly and shot off over our town in a second with a trail of light behind it.<n>

The light was bright yellow but and was bigger than a usual star and got fade as it travelled toward south and faded up-to disappearance.  The total time taken was about 1 minute. After 2-3 minutes the same procedure was repeated but now the light travelled less than before and remained in the sky for about 45 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is Kota City in Rajasthan state of India (25.155181,75.83394).  There is no airport with regular flights and no air force base.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was not looking like a balloon or a kite neither it was a plane.  It was even not looking like a meteor as the speed was very slow and the light was stable with no trail. It was around 10-15 kms from us and there was no sound.<n>

While looking in the easterly direction I saw what appeared to be 11-12 red lights in the sky.  They were patterned in floating grid 3 across and 4 down somewhat equally spaced.  The lights were moving slowly towards one another and floating in what looked to be an intended pattern.  Originally it looked as though they were forming a constellation, but they never seemed to form one for indefinite period of time. I pulled over to take a video and slowly they began to disappear. Whether they merged into fewer lights, I am not sure but it did happen before I turned away with a couple of the lights. When I finally got to a point where a video was possible there was only one light left.<n>

They where moving fairly slow and at a low altitude. After they passed the apartment the light faded out quickly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then two more appeared, I yelled to my friend there are ufo&#39;s in the sky and a neighbor a few doors down popped around the corner and said there is more in the front. We went out front (east part of the building) and there was three more totaling eight that I had seem. They too flew west over the building and disappeared shortly after. The light just vanished and you couldn&#39;t tell anything ever happened. The neighbors boyfriend said he saw ten on his way home.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It is a very clear night and there isn&#39;t a cloud in the sky. It&#39;s odd how they vanished the way they did with the clear conditions. This isn&#39;t the first sighting I&#39;ve seem in Indiana but it is the first I&#39;ve seen in Lafayette. I&#39;ve seen them in Kokomo, In also.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I was facing south, with a great view of Downtown and the Space Needle.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At 10:34 I saw 7 or 8 bright orange orbs float upward from left to right seemingly from Capitol Hill or First Hill.  They continued to float/fly up behind the Space Needle heading from east to west. Some seemed to head south, and some seemed to head north before disappearing into the clouds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They appeared to move as fast as a small airplane or helicopter.  Seeing them fly across the sky and disappear into the clouds took about 3 or 4 minutes. 3 or 4 of these orange orbs were brighter than the rest.  They had a soft flickering quality.  They also appeared at first to be in a cluster, and then flew away from each other in a more perpendicular line while flying upwards.  Although the line was by no means perfectly straight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I sent a friend a text to ask if he had seen the bright orange orbs flying past the Space Needle.  He said no. At 10:54 pm another orange orb popped out of the sky over Capitol Hill or First Hill and flew upwards from left to right.  I told my friend to look out his window at, what I called, the loner orb.  He saw it and we watched it for about 5 minutes.  This one flew up west and north.  Finally, another lone orb appeared at 11:39 following the same flight pattern as the orb before it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After that I went home.  I have wondered why there haven’t been more reports of this sighting.  It was a beautiful Saturday night.  I know there must have been people at Kerry Park that night seeing the same thing I saw.  Please report what you saw!<n>
3/23/13 22:30|Spring|TX|Triangle|10 minutes|Multiple bright lights traveling southeast with one flyover.|5/15/13|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/096/S96779.html|108|ndxe201303| Multiple bright lights traveling southeast with one flyover.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I live in Spring, Texas.  I was in my backyard with my dogs somewhere between 10:15 and 10:45pm Saturday March 23, 2013.  I noticed what looked like a bright reddish light approaching high in the northwest and moving towards the southeast.  The light was singular and had no additional lights like the blinking lights you’d normally see on aircraft.  Still in the northwest, the light appeared to slow, then almost rise up and disappear into the cloud cover.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I took one dog in the house and returned to stay with my second one.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Looking back to the Northwest I noticed another two lights travelling in the same southeast direction.  Thinking that the first one was odd, I decided to keep my focus on these next lights to see what they did.  The two lights were not too close to one another; spaced almost like aircraft that are in a specific flight pattern when coming into an airport.  The lead light (again a singular light) started out red and became a little whiter as it got closer.  Originally I thought this was because of the cloud cover, atmospheric conditions, etc.  It too disappeared into the cloud cover, but I decided to keep focused on the sky where it disappeared.  Within a few seconds, a black mass appeared in the sky moving in the same path as the light.  It was low and continued on the same southeast trajectory.   It moved silently in the sky over my house, right above me and continued southwest, disappearing over the horizon.  The mass was black against the low cloud cover and low.  It was t! riangular shape although not defined (like that of a fuselage and wings).  There was no sound as it passed over or preceding it after it disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Whatever the object was, it was fairly low and moved at a steady pace to the southeast.  There was no visible light at this point on the object.  The moon was partially visible through the upper cloud cover.  The object was a solid black mass.  At the altitude it was at, I’m guessing the size of a small jet, but again appearing solid and flat from my vantage point.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I also observed two more of these ‘fireball type lights’ that seemed higher in the sky in the northwest. These were also travelling toward the southeast.  The final two that I observed, were not visible together.  One appeared and disappeared in the cloud cover in the northwest and then the second, also disappearing in the high cloud cover in the northeast.  Each of these appeared to slightly move west right before they disappeared.<n>

It was shaped like a typical saucer you would see in the movies, the shape of two bowls stacked on each other.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was perfectly still, neon yellow and about the same size as the moon.  It had a greenish glow to it and was very very still, like a picture.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At the end of the road there was some gas stations and pharmacies, and I&#39;m sure there were cars next to ours.  I think they may have witnessed it as well, but I can&#39;t be sure.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I pointed it out to my mother and sister and they both looked at it in awe and shock.  It was way too still to be a kite or a blimp.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;m not sure anyone else saw it besides me and my family, but it was visibly there in the sky for as long as I was being drove down the road.  I&#39;d say it lasted about 4 minutes, before the trees got in the way.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I can&#39;t seem to remember the rest of that night for some reason.  Which is another thing I find kind of peculiar, as something extraordinary as that is to be forgotten.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I hope this information is useful.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.

They (the orbs) were coming from the south moving to the north. At the same time a commercial airliner was traveling from the north to the south. That’s when the orbs slowed and turned to the east. We thought they were helicopters at first. Then we thought there might have been a rocket launch at Cape Canaveral.  We see them all the time from our house. The orbs were as big and bright as the rockets they launch without the vapor trail. Canaveral doesn’t launch 2 rockets at the same time.

We were outside under the night sky and looking at the stars.  I saw these 2 strange stars, towards the east of us.  I showed to my husband and daughter and we were all looking at them, he said he had never seen those before.  We realised that they were moving.  They looked like just big stars.  They were brighter than the other stars.  We looked at them for about 30 seconds, then they started fading and dissappear.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We always look at the sky and have observed the ISS and other statelites.  These however were not like anything I have seen before.  My husband cannot explain what they were but is not a believer of aliens etc.  Neither do I.  We always look for alternative explanations and believe sitings to be hoax.  However, I know what I saw and because there were 2 objects, they were so high in the sky and they both faded together.  I think before they completely faded their lights went redish.  I am left very confused.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I was using 10x32 binoculars viewing the moon from a large open window when I noticed what looked like a streak in the southern area of the moon, rather below the moon and to the right. I thought it may have just been nothing, it was still very much daylight out, and I barely saw anything but possible movement.  The sky was mostly clear. Within 10 seconds or so another movement, more like streak, drew my attention and binocular focus to the area East almost North East of the moon.  I was still not able to identify what I saw because of  high speed and small area.  But within 15 seconds or so I saw a bright thin blue streak traveling at about a 45 degree downward NE to SW angle “ / ” in the center of the binocular circle.  The streak was short in length leaving no trail, traveling a seeming! distance of the width of the moon visible in the blue sky.  The object streaked toward the East part of the moon and vanished within just a range of around or less than a No. 2 pencil width if I were to draw to size what we saw (which we have).<n> <n><n> <n><n> I shouted to my wife who was nearby that “I just saw a shooting star! I mean a meteor! It was a bright blue streak..” Were the first descriptions I could give, as I maintained watching the area the object vanished in with binoculars.  In no less than 15 seconds an object appeared in the place where the blue streak ended.  The object, as best as I can describe, was a twinkling multiple color silvery object that resembled a star in nature.  The center was shimmering whitish silver.  The size of the object through binoculars was a magnitude around that of the brightest star.  I had a small moment of, I guess adrenaline and panic where at that time I called my wife over trying to describe the object and show her the object through the binoculars.  I do not have 20/20 vision, but I do not need the aid of glasses, and the object was just barely visible to the naked eye, with intermittent and often twinkling that made the object distinguishingly visible.  My wife could quickly spot the ob! ject which maintained its position very close to the moon, as if on the outskirts of an invisible atmosphere.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We observed the object passing the binoculars back and forth as I tried to record with a camera phone at one point, but it couldn’t pick anything up, even tried to have the camera lens to lens with the binoculars with no success.  The object began to traverse very slowly downward around the bottom of the moon twinkling and shimmering, but would also fade for short times.  It was easy to track as it traveled the same slow speed.  As the object traveled precisely maintaining the same distance from the moon as when it first appeared, the object made a full travel from the Eastern part of the moon to the Western side where it stopped and sat exactly at the West center side of the moon.  Also during this time I noticed a couple other streaks to the South of the moon while my wife used the binoculars, the streaks were similar to the second one I saw at the beginning of the event.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As the object was making it’s final approach where it stopped at the West side of the moon, it began to change.  The object was a very bright magnitude now with four other objects appearing, very similar in physical description, just smaller objects.  The four smaller objects appeared in a very close range of the first object, as if the smaller objects were attached or on a grid.  The objects never traveled away from the first or appeared to move independently.  The four objects appeared and sat around the first object, maintaining direct North South East West positions like a compass or cross “ + “ but not connected by any visible means. The five objects did not move for approximately five minutes, other than twinkling and shimmering, with the center and original object being the largest. The time was about 6:26PM when the object faded away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have not been able to find anything on the internet about this event, at all. The only close possibility is a picture on the internet from Sydney, Australia. But the only similarities are the date and appearance of objects’ distance from the moon in this picture may be somewhat close. But the website and description are not detailed enough. Thank you to those who took the time to read this, and to those who post what they see out there! There has to be other people who saw this too..<n>

There was no jet engine sound, and the boys and I both agreed that they looked line they were glowing kind of like fire.  They were evenly spaced, maybe a half mile apart.

I&#39;m not sure what time it was.  The sky was clear and I glanced up at the stars. I then noticed a star brighter than any other star near Orion.  It was a bright light, it looked like a very bright star, to the right and above the right shoulder of Orion (So his left shoulder if he&#39;s looking at us).  Orion was in the southwest part of the sky, almost upright, slightly leaning to the right.  The bright light stayed lit up for about 10 seconds before it just disapeared.  I stared in that spot for about 10 minutes but it didn&#39;t return.  It was very cold that night so I didn&#39;t bother staying outside and continue to watch.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I know what I saw but I have no idea what it was. I have been searching online for answers and stumbled across this site.  The only story I have heard that comes close to what I saw is a story someone posted from Hawaii.  The only exception is his was a flash that would return every 10 seconds.  I saw a light that didn&#39;t move (unless it was moving extremely slowly) it stayed lit for about 10 seconds, and then vanished.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date is approximate.

The light was large, larger and brighter than any other stars or lights in the sky.  It was also more orange than white a different color than anything in the black sky.  I have grown up 40 years in this area and have never observed a light such as this.  I have observed air planes landing into Logan airport for years and know the airplaine light colors and patterns.  This was no airplaine in my opinion, too low traveling in the wrong direction.<n>

I usually watch the night sky for the plannets , shooting stars and satellites but this was none of the above and definitely not a plane from its movements (strange wobble ) and how bright it was plus there was no engine sound or flashing marker lights.  It was still at the start then headed north east away from my position . The strange wobble it had while moving has left me puzzeled as to what it was .  It flew a straight line for a few seconds then wobbled then normal then wobbled again this happened with it every few seconds until it went into the clouds .  I&#39;ve never seen anything like it .  Then 10 minutes later 2 helicopters flew across in the same direction the object went im not sure if they were military or not but its very rare to see two helicopters together here.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

There were about three to four cars in my view infront of me.  I saw a slow light moving east to west that was an obvious plane to my 1 o&#39;clock position.  Out of the corner of my eye an orangey light was dancing to my 11 o&#39;clock position over.  It looked like a kid playing with a sparkler.  I couldn&#39;t have been the only one who saw it because three of the cars infront of me applied the brakes on the open road.  It was abrupt, but then I looked back up and the orange light fired off heading south at an incredible speed and turned more red, and went out of sight.  It took probably 3 seconds to watch it go out of sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was about 8:30 PM to 8:40.  I asked my husband if he knew if there were any new “antennas” installed in the middle of the city because I did not remember any there...  Then I noticed, the &amp;quot;antenna’s lights&amp;quot; where moving slowly and going up.  Then I knew I was watching strange fireballs. Both lights where very red, close and parallel.  They were about 500 feet high.  They took a course to the northeast.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I asked my husband to stop immediately the car and went out.  The first two disappeared slowly.  Then I saw 3 more not at the same spot as the two first ones, but farther and higher, around 800 to 1000 feet ASL.  They kept the same track, then two more, appeared from nowhere and took more or less the same route.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After arriving home I kept watching the sky, but did not spot anything else.<n>

Something was moving across the sky low, from West to East, but not particularly fast.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Suddenly, it turned yellow-orange and then disappeared down behind the trees (and house) to my right front.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I think it was flaming out as it disappeared, but I’m not 100% positive!  It was visible for a few seconds, although it seemed longer at the time!  PARTICULARS  I was facing N 47 degrees, 06 minutes 15 seconds E (according to my house plat!)  I was looking up at approximately 10 degrees (from horizontal) at the center of my field of view (FOV).<n> <n><n> <n><n> I noticed the object at 30 degrees to the left of center line of FOV.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I lost the object at 35 degrees to the right of center line of FOV.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Trajectory was fairly straight, at angle of 3 to 4 degrees to my horizontal, up on left to down on right.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Trees in front on me were about 480 feet away, at right angle to centerline of my FOV.  The house behind which I lost sight of object is about 145 feet away (2-story, split entry model).<n> <n><n> <n><n> Time was approximately 8:53 PM.<n> <n><n> <n><n> NOTEs:  I got into my van as I was heading to local 7-11 store to purchase lottery entries (Mega Millions and PowerBall), which I do at about the same time every Tuesday and Friday evening.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When a police officer came to the neighborhood at approx 8:11 PM and we were IDing the time of my observation, he said his Sergeant had sent out a message at 8:54PM to all officers alerting them to be on the lookout for anything unusual.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had reported the sighting, but because of the altitude, color and speed I thought it was something local (i.e., something other than a meteor) because all I had ever observed were shooting stars and meteorite showers!  I offered to the police that I thought it might have come down not to distant from me!  Therefore, we didn’t want to rule out possibility that it was a nearby event!  Later on 10 PM news (local FOX, Channel 5) they reported that there had been a meteor event, seen from North Carolina to New England, and someone had report seeing it from Frederick, Maryland.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The news added that it was not unusual for observers to think meteors in the atmosphere are than they actually are, but meteors usually stop glowing before reaching 5 miles high because they have slowed so much by then.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This morning, on the NBC news (local Channel 4), they showed a still B&amp;W photo from Maryland and reported that it had been seen from Florida to New England and the colors were bluish and greenish to bright orange in Maryland.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I concluded that I picked up the object as it was slowing from higher speed (whitish-bluish) and turning to yellow-orange.  So the observer in Frederick, MD area and I were likely seeing the same thing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I think the news gave the time as being around 8 PM.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I served 23 years in U.S. Army and have now worked 24+ years as Defense Contractor (hold high security clearance.<n>

The object appears in only one photo, it is what I perceive to be diamond shaped and quite bright. at the time that I took this photo I was photographing a storm cell to my north and so this object stands out against the black clouds.  This is the second time in two weeks that I have captured a strange object in this area, the other time was March 8 2013 but those objects were photographed on a sunny day and I sent you 6 photographs of that event along with a report.<n>

We saw 2 (what appeared to be) &amp;quot;shooting stars&amp;quot; fly right between 2 crafts but dissappearing before reaching the crafts.<n>

My neighborhood isn&#39;t lit very well so the only lights around were my bicycle headlight and the moonlight.  To my right about as low as a plane beginning to land and brighter than any star in the area, a bright green light appeared. It moved with no smoke trail about as fast as a regular passenger aircraft for about 2-4 seconds, then appeared to have thrust trails for less than a second and disappeared into the distance.  The speed was beyond anything I have ever seen or heard of, my headphones were in and playing full blast so there is no sound to report.  There seem to be other reports of a hovering green light in the area around the same time but from my research so far none of the sightings have seemed to be as brief as this one was.

An object caught my eye moving at a fast rate of speed (equivalent to a car driving by you at about 35 40 mph) coming out of the tree line. It was going N to S. I would say it was about 300 to 400 ft in the air.  Circular in shape and size similar to a traffic light lens. It was a green neon bright color and solid.  I reached for my phone in my pocket to get ready to film and I observed a tracer or tail emit from the object about 15 feet out same color. It went another 20ft in that shape and imploded emitting 2 or 3 small balls from it almost like a roman candle and then just disappeared. Almost as if it exploded or hit something. It never changed it&#39;s flight pattern or height so it&#39;s hard for me to believe it was a shooting star. Specifically because of its size and color.  The green neon color was amasing looking and a color I don&#39;t see some one could recreate. ! Witnessed another sighting several months ago that I reported, I will tell you this one had my heart pounding. Spectacular to see.<n>

The object appeared to be about 4 to seven miles away and about 15,000 feet up.  It appeared to be traveling slowly heading south, as the tail was behind the object.  After a minute or two the object stated to lose altitude and seemed to face my general direction.  The tail was no longer visible during this time and only the white round cloud color could be seen.   As I exited the first Petaluma off-ramp the object appeared low about 500 to 700 feet and at a distance of about 1 mile.  The white color I had seen was gone, and for a brief moment I saw a round solid object and then I lost it behind the trees.  I kept looking in the area but could not see it again. the tail on the object would disappear after about 80 yards.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Our community is surrounded by a nature preserve and to the north end there are are no developments for many miles which we verified with google earth.  We first observed a very large orange glowing orb which ascended from the north end of the nature preserve moving straight up in a fast but steady pace to quite a high elevation at which point it no longer glowed but we could still see lights as it traveled eastward.  Needless to say we were quite surprised when another glowing orange orb followed suit around 15 seconds later and did exactly the same as the first and joined the first orb.  This series of events happened 2 more times, four orbs in total.  The four objects travelled together in a straight line one after the other and then quickly disappeared.  We did not hear any type of engine noise at all and as this community is dead quiet at night if there h! ad been any type of noise being emitted we would have heard it.  We observed the first two orbs ourselves until our neighbours came out to greet a visitor arriving in a car and we then pointed out to them the last two orbs.  The night sky was very dark that night so it was difficult to tell if there was much cloud coverage.   While out golfing in the morning, the day after the event, two helicopters were seen circling over the area where the orbs appeared from.  The engines from the helicopters were clearly heard.   All observers we would estimate as being in their mid fifties, university educated .<n>

I saw two very bright orange lights in the sky, they were not stars as they were moving - at first I thought they were planes but both my husband and I decided against that, they didn&#39;t have pulsing lights, they were stationary neither moving away from us or toward us.  The lights seemed parallel to each other, then one light seemed to move up higher than the other but keeping a similar distance apart - then the lower light seemed to get brighter then started to dim, as the light became less bright it moved at a faster speed, the moving further away to the east then disappeared.  The other light remained for a while longer then it too moved upwards all the while it&#39;s light also became less bright, I could just make out an orange dot then it vanished completely! -  I waited around for a while longer but the lights did not return.  I did see a plane, but these move at a faster pace so you can tell if they are planes flying in or out.  Judging by the clouds these lights were high up - they could have been helicopters I suppose but not sure they were very stationary.  Would be great if anyone else noticed these lights in Bremerton or Port Orchard.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

These were nothing like the lights from the airplanes we could see and hear in the sky.<n>

I fortuitously noticed a reflective stationary sphere, silver or white, off towards the NE.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I first thought it was a balloon, but the day was breezy, this thing was stationary, and was clearly not a balloon.  Distance and size tough to assess, as there was no nearby object to serve as a basis for comparison.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In any event, I observed the object for 10-15 minutes, and recorded three short video clips using my iphone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I knew it was not a balloon, but also knew that an iphone video clip of a stationary spherical object would not convince anyone otherwise, so I never planned to do anything with the video.  Nonetheless, I shared the video clips with friends and family; this is where it gets interesting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My sister-in-law, who was not present at the sighting, noticed a streaking flash across the screen on one of the video clips.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I uploaded the iphone video onto my computer, and viewed the video as close to frame by frame as I could (simpy hit play and then pause as quickly as I could).  At the 27 second mark, you can see a clearly non-artifactual object (possibly up to four onjects) moving at an incredible speed from right to left across the screen.  Not sure the speed, but it had to be several thousand miles an hr.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The objects are not readily evident on the video in real time, other than as a terribly brief streak/flash on the video; the kind of thing one barely perceives.  The best analogy is almost like the perception of very faint stars using one&#39;s peripheral vision; you know they are there, but you can&#39;t really get enough visual info to process the data.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Incidentally, no noise whatsoever was heard.<n> <n><n> <n><n> If desired, I can provide GPS coordinates and the video clip of interest.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My backgound: I am a physician. I am also a GA pilot, and although no expert on aircraft identification, I know this was not a balloon, and I know these were aircraft unlike anything I have ever seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> FYI, I filed a sighting report and the video clips in April to MUFON.  I am filing again simply because I don&#39;t see it in any database, and so I include it for the database.<n>

3/19/13 21:00|New Paltz|NY|Fireball|3 minutes|Brilliantly colored orange oval shaped object, seen from very close range.|5/15/13|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/096/S96640.html|166|ndxe201303| Brilliantly colored orange oval shaped object, seen from very close range.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The sighting occurred at approximately 9.40 pm on the night of March the 19th, in New Paltz, New York.  My step sister and I were having a cigarette on the side deck of my home when I noticed an extremely brightly colored orange light moving across the sky from a westward direction heading south.  It was a very dark, clear night sky and I immediately recognized the light to be brighter than anything I have ever seen before.  My step sister had her back to it and after allowing it a split second to register I immediately grabbed her attention and pointed her to the light source.  We quickly moved off the deck to get a better view and angle on the light.  I initially thought I would see a blinking light or quickly see an explanation.  Soon realizing what was happening I ran back to the deck side door and called for my mother and stepfather.  Then I ran back to my left side yard and saw the definite shape of a oval object that looked as if it were blazing on fi! re.  The object was roughly 300 feet above the ground and the easiest way to describe it was a Japanese balloon glowing bright orange, this was the logic I used to portray it.  The object/orb was impossibly brilliant orange and from a point blank view had a definite shape with absolutely no wings/sound/or blinking lights.  The light remained consistent throughout its entire flight.  My mother and stepfather and stepsister and I all watched as it gently moved almost hovering across the sky as if it were being pulled by a string.  The object appeared to be moving very gently and slowly but covering a lot of space at the same time.  The speed seemed to remain the same but within a few minutes it was very high in the sky and it seemed to be moving at a gradual incline.  The four of us agreed without question it was something we had never seen before and was simply unexplainable.  The defining details I clearly have imprinted in my mind were its brilliant color, definite shape a! nd precise smooth line of travel and ability to cover a lot of! space i n a short amount of time.  There in my opinion was zero chance of misidentifying this object, it was from a point blank view point and very definite in shape and color.  My stepfather thought at first it was a fireball.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The craft were very odd appearing, dark in color, with each craft oriented in the same direction, facing south. The shape of each craft looked similar to an outline of the New England Patriots helmet logo, with the tapered end facing north.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Each craft &amp;quot;floated&amp;quot; independently, with slight movements among them in different directions such that I was able to discern multiple crafts instead of one.  The height of the crafts was about 3000 feet, and they were drifting away from me to the west.  When I first saw them, I had a very eery feeling as if they were monitoring or observing the ground from above.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The crafts were silent.  They were too large for birds. I had wondered if they were drones, but they moved so close to each other that it would have been impossible for them to prevent interference among them with propellors or with other conventional means of propulsion. I had also wondered if they were kites, but the objects were too large and too high to be kites because there was no wind that morning that could have kept the kites aloft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I stopped my car, and walked around to the other side near the west to begin taking an iPhone video of them. By the time that I had started the video recording, the crafts had drifted sufficiently far away such that they appear only as very small dots on the video. Because they were drifting away, and because I was late to work, I stopped the video recording, and returned to my car.<n>

3/17/13 21:30|Portland|OR|Formation|30 minutes|Cluster of bright orange lights floating, jumping around in sky|5/15/13|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/096/S96654.html|171|ndxe201303| Cluster of bright orange lights floating, jumping around in sky<n> <n><n> <n><n> While driving home last night, around 9:30pm with fairly clear skies I saw about 4 distinct lights floating in the sky. They appeared to be moving together but not connected. They were very bright orange and high up, probably as high as a plane flying at a very low cruising altitude – or a helicopter at a very high flying altitude.  I would describe the movement like hot air balloons, but a few would move up or down ( in relation to the others from my perspective.. could have been side to side ) in what seemed to be a controlled pattern. As I drove I thought it was very strange , trying to focus on the road but very distracted by what these lights were. When I came to an intersection where more of the sky was visible I saw so many more, at least 30. Others have reported seeing 50-100 earlier in the evening! I saw them moving west to east.  Mostly in a cluster , a few trailed off behind. At this point I was very shocked and pulled over, and got out of my car ! to look. I took a photo and video with my cell phone but since my camera is not that great - the photos are blurred and hard to distinguish. The Extremely bright orange lights were like nothing I have seen. They did not flicker or pulse, just a steady bright light. The 30 (estimate) lights moving kept going slowly – to the west. Some would rotate around others... or move to different parts of the group but as a whole they all seemed to be going west. There were many people looking up at the sky wondering what they were. ( it is a downtown area – many restaurants bars etc... ) One particular bar/grill by my apartment appeared to have all the patrons outside pointing and wondering what the lights were. Eventually, they faded into the distance as they all moved west and disappeared into the night sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After doing some research I discovered these lights were around Portland a few hours earlier as well, as reported by many others<n> <n><n> <n><n> (http://www.columbian.com/news/2012/nov/15/experts-uncertain-about-reports-strange-lights-ove/)  This was a true phenomenon .  In my entire life I have not heard of any atmospheric or natural occurrence like this. (Apparently no one else has either.) A local museum suggested it sounds like it was in the atmosphere – but from my perspective it sure seemed like they were floating / moving at the altitude described above.<n>

3/17/13 17:00|Austin|TX|Changing|5 minutes|White blimp-like object, glows pink at times and changes shape|5/15/13|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/096/S96667.html|174|ndxe201303| White blimp-like object, glows pink at times and changes shape<n> <n><n> <n><n> Myself and another witness observed what we initially thought was a white blimp.  Its bright white football shape quickly morphed into, what I can best describe as, a series of cotton balls attached to one another. It then began to writhe much like an amorphous earthworm. At the end of the object there was a small appendage that seemed to dangle separately, but it (the appendage) did not change shape.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was a &amp;quot;fuzz&amp;quot; surrounding the entire object that seemed to not allow proper focus (i.e. very few sharp edges or contrast). When it was at its closest, I thought I detected a pink hazy light, much like bio luminescence. And after a quick grab of my binoculars, the pink was obvious. Even after it had moved further away, I could see the pink light. It looked as though it was inside the object, and slightly outside the dorsal portion of it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was silently moving from east to west, with surface winds approximately blowing at 5mph from the SSE. But at several points during the observation, it was moving into the wind. It seemed to be a controlled &amp;quot;flight&amp;quot; and not wind driven. Its height was below the low clouds that were drifting lazily by. What ever the cloud deck height was in Austin that day will give its approximate height. At one point there was a twin-engined small plane moving parallel to the object&#39;s position. As the plane moved closer, the object moved further away. Eventually the object simply disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I observed the object for at least 5-minutes, but the first witness only saw it for a minute or so. I attempted to film it, but it doesn&#39;t show up on my camera. I did find a video of another observation that looks almost identical to what I saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n> (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCEyDXYC2VM)<n>
3/17/13 15:00|Indiahoma|OK|Unknown|20-30 seconds|A pressurized-sounding wind seen moving slowly about a Wildlife Preserve without any visible craft above its effects.|5/15/13|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/096/S96666.html|175|ndxe201303| A pressurized-sounding wind seen moving slowly about a Wildlife Preserve without any visible craft above its effects.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Greetings- I have never been a skeptic after witnessing an orange/red glowing orb in upstate NY as a teenager which resulted in a time lapse to my knowledge but was never discussed afterward amongst the two people in my company.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The following event occurred today:  As an avid hiker, I was resting on a trail which I enjoy trekking every week for about 5 months now.  The trail itself is roughly two hours long.  I was about half an hour into the hike.  The trail head is not near any main thoroughfare and the number of cars at the trailhead today was minimal so there were few people on trail.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Let me describe the area;  The trail area was a wishbone-shaped terrain.  The main trail was singular before breaking into two parts.  I was resting at the lower &amp;quot;part&amp;quot;.  On each opposing side the terrain grew gradually on the opposing sides into simple enbankments rising somewhat quickly.  Opposite to me was not a rocky terrain but was mostly low-level scrub brush and the local spruce reaching no more than 10-12 feet in this specific area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I rested I began hearing what sounded like a wind in the distance.  It immediately registered to me as a moving vehicle before I realized I was miles from any road.  The sound was first heard moving from my right out of sight up the trail from where I had just traveled.  As I realized there was no way it could be a vehicle I tried to register what in the world it was.  I kept watching the trail bend where I heard the sound approaching and wondering what in the world it was.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The wind here in Oklahoma is different- it can gust quite differently than most places. I&#39;ve lived after having been active-duty in the Air Force for 10 years abroad and having live in upstate NY near Lake George and south of Lake Placid growing up. This wind was unlike anything I&#39;ve heard or seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was moving up the path still out of my line of sight. When the sound came into view I knew it was something but I saw nothing. I saw no object or any craft but &amp;quot;it&amp;quot; continued to emit a strange sound like a &amp;quot;hollow wind&amp;quot; but there was no object. It began deviating slowly away from the trail up the embankment and I watched its effects. It was moving quite slowly and deliberately and it made my hair stand up to watch it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I knew it wasn&#39;t the wind but there wasn&#39;t any object or anything. As it moved slowly enough for me to watch it the effects area of its entire motion was about 20-25 feet in length- meaning, the area which was affected by this movement of air was a 20-25 foot space of land/shrubbery/dirt underneath which was continully being moved as it moved slowly forward or more accurately to my left at about 50-75 yards in front of me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was quite mezmorized knowing wind doesn&#39;t make that sound or travel that slow or deliberate while remaining as though contained in the same specific area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As it moved into almost my direct sight at approx. 50-75 yards away, I muttered &amp;quot;what is that&amp;quot;? At that point it slowed and stopped in place but continued moving things about underneath it but in place with an approx. width of about 20-25 feet. I was still dumbfounded as I continually looked above it and saw nothing but watched its effects beneath.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At this point my instinct fight/flight was taking over but as &amp;quot;it&amp;quot; remained still, I was better able to hear the sound more clearly and it sounded more like escaping pressurized air. Also at this time I noticed clear evidence that this was nothing ordinary because the branches of the small spruce trees underneath were moving vertically up and down and NOT horizontally as they would have with any normal wind.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Ater &amp;quot;it&amp;quot; remained in place for about 4-5 seconds there is no question I could not see anything above it. I did feel like I was looking at something though because I let my eyes scan freely and they locked on about 30 feet above the spot.<n> <n><n> <n><n> However- the sound slowly stopped, not immediately but it faded and was gone. That was it. No further sound- no nothing. After reading some about sightings I&#39;ve read there is often radiation found in the vicinity so I was not eager to inspect the area but to perfectly honest I just wanted to leave the area quickly.<n>

The reason that I was outside because there where college students yelling and screaming outside so I assumed that they were intoxicated because of spring break.  When I walked out on to the balcony I saw the young students pointing up in the sky and yelling.  When I figured out what the people where pointing at as was terrified it was an object possibly about the size of a yacht or semi-truck in the shape of a triangle with red light on the side and a blue on the following side and at center point was green.  Then the large white light at the center of the craft beamed at light of some kind of light at a nearby airplane.  These events occurred in a two to five minute time span I don’t wish to leave my name but my email is ((deleted))<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

I was surprised by this due to the fact that it was not a clear night, but instead one with rather low visibility having only a few stars in the sky. At first I thought it was mars, but then quickly dismissed that as the hovering object began to move across the sky about the same speed as a plane, yet with no flashing lights or noise just a silent steady glow.  The object continued to float across the sky in an upward zig zag pattern for a few minutes, which made me think it could have been a red chinese lantern, but I could tell by the size ratio in the sky and the high altitude it was at that this could not be possible.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As it approached a nearby star the object stayed motionless, let off a white glow and then faded into a dim light (that could have been mistaken as a star) and then ultimately disappeared and vanished into thin air.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After its disappearance I was left in shock feeling uneasy, and overwhelmed, the experience even led me to tears.

As they climbed higher (I thought they could have been firework), they stopped then one by one disappeared.  After the first one disappeared I yelled to my husband to come look.  He came and was amazed too.  I had to make sure I was seeing this right.  He saw them, then a fourth showed up and one by one they stopped, slowly disappated, then disappeared until they were all gone.  I&#39;ve never seen anything like this.  They were shaped like diamonds with four fire red colored corner dots.<n>
3/16/13 22:30|Armadale (Australia)||Light|2-5 seconds|UFO in Armadale Western Australia, the sighting was around about 10:30ish at night, the date was 03/16/13.|5/15/13|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/096/S96658.html|185|ndxe201303| UFO in Armadale Western Australia, the sighting was around about 10:30ish at night, the date was 03/16/13.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On the night of 03/16/13 in Armadale, Perth, Western Australia at 10:30ish pm, a light lit up all around me and my neighbour while we were drinking beer out the back of his property. It was very bright, brighter than any light I have ever seen, not even a halogen bulb could out perform this light. I liken the motor to that of an electric generator noise and that this was all I heard for a few seconds before it vanished. With an electric generator: lots of energy goes into changing direction of the pistons, some energy is turned into sounds of vibration. A very bright light was to my left, and on the right side of me there was a red tail light glare.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I looked out the right hand side to see if any cars were shining their high beams. None. It was impossible for any vehicle to shine their high beam over the fence, and if it could, it would not be able to illuminate the fence completely due to obstacles being in the way, it would have cast the objects shadows onto the fence. The fence was lit up with no shadows cast upon it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I thought at that particular time &#39;I would have heard a vehicle&#39;s engine, so it wasn&#39;t a vehicle&#39;. It was at this stage I realised it wasn&#39;t anything I knew existed that is man-made. I have been in a couple motor vehicle accidents in the past, and this is the only way I could represent what I felt like at that point in time, an observer to what was happening above and all around me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It wasn&#39;t like a sound from an electric generator either.  I used the electric generator to give you an idea of the sound I heard. It was definately a rotating click of about 2-3 second rotation, but it was a faint clicking rotational noise.  We were stuck in the middle of something I regard as a whirling vortex mass. I could feel its presence.  This thing felt as though it was overtop of me because I looked in all directions except above to see where the light was emanating from.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were both drinking and just kept drinking while this happened.  I was relaxed by this stage of the night when this event occurred.  Afterward, we laughed it off and got a few more beers. It wasn&#39;t till after it happened (5-10 minutes) when we both said to each other &#39;what was that?&#39;  I looked up an internet forum to see if anything was reported.  There was a sighting on the 13/3/13 in Queens Park, this location is a few suburbs away up the Armadale Train Line about 25 kilometers away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The electric sound I think was buzzing all around.<n>

I then looked up to see if the stars were visible.  As I did I saw a bright orange light directly overhead, moving south toward Marshall, AR.  The object made no sound and emitted no other lights.  It moved at a medium pace while making lists to the left and right every 15 seconds or so. After about three minutes it gave a few flickers and disappeared.  However, it did not disappear over the horizon or mountains, instead it disappeared out the sky over the horizon.  The orange glow was most likely caused by the smoke of nearby wildfires, that had been burning the previous days.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness provides no contact information.

The object was triangular in shape and had three bright orange fiery lights.  The light source was large...definitely not a point source like a light bulb that you would see on a normal aircraft.  There were no other lights on the craft.  It moved across the sky at a fairly fast speed with one light in the front and the other two behind in a triangular shape.  The object was also fairly large, though it is dificult to say how large not knowing what it&#39;s elevation was.  To estimate it was about the size of an F-14 at about a thousand feet.  As the object moved acroos the sky it was completely silent.<n>

They were halfway up into the night sky, well into seemingly space, yet close enough to us to seem withing the atmosphere.  They were positioned in a diamond sequence as if the four coners of something huge.  We stood in awe, they did not move, change colour or brighten-dim, but one by one went out sharply as if turned off by a switch.   No noises, just went out one by one.<n>

As I looked the two stars started moving away from each other rapidly, one east-north-east and one west-south-west.  The one moving west went dark for about a second then relit and appeared to then make zig zag movements until I could no longer see it due to trees.  The light moving east moved rapidly and made no sound.  The light moved in direct opposet direction from each other.<n>

It had become dark and we were just looking over the harbor.  Unexpectedly, while taking pictures of the water, I captured at least three pictures showing four disc shaped objects with lights on them.  The discs made a diamond altogether, one on top, on on the bottom, and two in the middle and slightly to the left and right.  I was standing outside, so all thoughts of this being a mere &#34;reflection&#34; are wrong.  There is also no way this is another building, I&#39;ve been in Baltimore more than enough times to know there is no building that tall out there, and based on the picture it would be impossible. It would be in the middle of the water.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was looking through pictures on my computer and four three of these pictures.  Two are very clear and the other it actually seems to be moving.  It is in a different location somewhat to the left and a bit unclear.  The weird thing is, I hadn&#39;t actually seen it at the time, I had heard my brother say &#34;what is that?&#34; but I hadn&#39;t paid any attention to it.  I quickly took about ten pictures and in some the crafts show up and in most they do not.<n>

They were moving horizontally, vertically and at an angle. They got very close to one another at one point, looking as if they were about to merge and then sped away from each other at high speed. After about 25 mins, they seemed to lower towards the ground and we lost sight of them.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

North Bay, Ontario, Canada)  My fiancee and I go every clear night to a park located at the above location to look at the stars, this night we were parked pointed SSW parallel with the road.  We go to this location around the same time every night arriving at the park around 23:15-23:30.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We both spotted the object rising above the horizon infront of us (SSW) about 5 minuets after arriving at the park.  What we both saw was a small orange-yellowish solid light slowly rising above the horizon and continuing to rise for about 15 to 20 seconds and then disappear about two feet above the horizon from our perspective.  The light stayed the same size throughout it&#39;s ascension above the horizon in front of us and did not leave any sort of visible trail.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My fiancee and I as I said before try to every night we can when it is clear go out to this location to look at the stars, never saw this kind of object before and have not seen it since in the 5 years we have been going to this location.  I am a television producer here in North Bay, and my fiancee is a student attending the local college here.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We have seen several meteor showers both ourselves and together and have yet to see one that looks like this, normally you can see a flickering of the light from the meteor but this light we saw that night was solid.  My first thought was that we were seeing it travel straight towards our location since from our perspective the object rose over the horizon and ascended directly upwards.  I have seen the ISS numerous times, and I often use satellite tracking apps on my phone to locate and see flyovers over my location so I am quite familiar with what they look like, and this object looked too big, bright, and coloured to be a satellite.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Anyways, I hope this is of some help, as I said before we go out to this location almost every night the clouds allow us to  and have never seen this object before or since even though it was a couple months ago now it is still fresh in my mind as I always visualize where it came from and its pattern each time we go back out to see if it does repeat or not.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

It was a very clear night. We live near an airport and see air traffic constantly so all of us can easily spot a plane or helicopter and even blimps day or night.  This was definitely none of the above.  The orb was completely silent.  After hovering for a few minutes it began to move east very slowly then faded and disappeared.  Shortly afterward a helicopter came over the house and circled over the area where the object had been.  Since it was after 11 P.M. we were unable to see what type of helicopter it was.  This is the second red orb I’ve seen in my lifetime.  I had a much closer encounter with one in 1998 or 99’ in California that lasted about 10 minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

I went out on to the front porch at my parents house to let the dog out, I saw a strange light moving across the sky, it appeared to be on the mountain road but did not turn where you would have run out of road.  I had my dad come to look at it as it was flying he caught the tail end of the first one, and my brother came to see what the commotion was about. it had disappeared to the north sky.  As I was describing where it had came from another appeared out of the same area and we also caught it on video, looking at the video run time was 40 plus seconds and it was out of sight south to north, then the third appeared and was as described.  The next night was the same exact thing except that the time was 21:00 hrs, and there was only one at the time. We were talking  on the front porch ready to leave and heard a rumbling boom, there has been l! ots of these boom and rumble for weeks, and my brother said to us look there it is again!! same as the night before south to north.  The objects were all orange ball shaped or oval bright orange and traveled at a high rate of speed no sound except for the second night as described, the only time you could hear jet sounds was when there we jets flying in the sky. It was a flying object because the mountain behind the object is snow covered and then past the other mountain ranges. but was as low 7500 feet to be seen in front of the mountain ranges.<n>

3/15/13 20:34|Cape Coral|FL|Sphere|4 minutes|On Friday night, 3/15/13 at 8:34 pm I saw 6 round amber lights in the sky travelling slowly in a line-no sound-faded sequentially.|5/15/13|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/096/S96668.html|207|ndxe201303| On Friday night, 3/15/13 at 8:34 pm I saw 6 round amber lights in the sky travelling slowly in a line-no sound-faded sequentially.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On Friday night, March 15, 2013 at about 8:34 p.m. I was driving down a street near my home travelling in an east to west direction.  I was alone in my vehicle.  I looked out of my driver’s side window and saw 6 round yellowish orange (amber) lights in the sky to my left.  Three of the lights were traveling in a straight line.  The other three lights were slightly behind the first three and were in a more irregular formation relatively close together.  The lights were travelling very slowly in the sky from west to east remaining in the same formation.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I pulled my vehicle over to the side of the road to observe this further as the color and number of lights struck me as being rather odd.  I lowered the driver’s side window to determine if there was any sound.  I did not hear a motor or sound of any type.  The lights appeared to be silently moving across the sky.  They were travelling high enough in the sky that I listened closely to ensure that they were not some sort of small aircrafts or helicopters.  However, they were not so high that they could have been any sort of large commercial aircraft.  At the time that I observed the 6 amber colored lights, I also observed that there appeared to be an aircraft much higher in the sky with the usual flashing white light that can be observed on a high flying aircraft.  What distinguished this single white light from the stars was the fact that it was blinking and moving in the sky.  It provided me with a source of comparison regarding how far up in the sky the 6 amber colored lig! hts were.  They were lower in the sky and were not very large.  They appeared to be about 15-20 times larger than the stars that were in the sky that night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After observing the lights for about 3 minutes I called the Police Department nonemergency number at 8:37 pm to inquire whether anyone else had reported observing these lights in the sky.  I was informed that no one else had contacted them about the lights.  I was on the phone with the nonemergency police dispatcher for one minute (according to my cell phone).  As I continued to observe the lights travelling silently in an eastward direction to my left, one by one they began to fade out.  What was interesting was that this started with the first light, then the second, then the third, and so on (sequentially) until all 6 lights could no longer be seen.  I remember saying to the police dispatcher when she asked me about the lights that they were fading out and that some of them could no longer be seen.  The way in which the lights dimmed and faded out was as if there was a dimmer switch on them that slowly dimmed the light until it was finally out.  The speed of their movemen! t did not change, and they made no sudden or erratic movements.  Once the lights started to fade, it did not take long before the 6 lights could no longer be seen.  The entire incident from the time that I first noticed the lights lasted about 4 minutes.  I do not know how long they were there prior to the time that I noticed them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After the lights had completely faded I looked in my review mirror and noticed a vehicle pulled over about a half of a block behind me with its headlights on.  I thought that perhaps the driver had also pulled over to observe the lights.  I turned around and went back to ask the individual if they had also witnessed the lights, but discovered that it was an individual who was in distress due to an accident and a flat tire.  The individual asked for my assistance in trying to get them out of the vehicle.  However, the door was jammed.  I called 911 to request assistance for the individual.  While waiting for the police to arrive I asked the individual if they had noticed the lights, but they stated that they had not.  Once the police arrived and were able to secure the situation I asked one of the police officers if he had seen the lights.  He said that he had not, but that they “see them all of the time”.  He said that he does not know what they are.<n> <n><n> <n><n> With regard to my background, I am a clinical social worker with a Master’s Degree in Social Work.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I thought it was large embers from someone&#39;s fireplace. It was fireball orbs flying from SW to NE directly over our house.  There was NO SOUND!<n> <n><n> <n><n> When all had passed, we thought it was over, but a single orb came trying to catch up going twice as fast as the others! I posted this when I read the article on your site about glowing orbs and wanted everyone who had witnessed some to write in about them. Wonder why so many now?  And , how about the tremendous jump in UFO activity in Canada!!  Good luck with your research and keep us in the know!!!<n>

As I was going out toward the front yard I noticed what looked like a falling star shoot across my neighbors skyline.  The flight path of the object went from my neighbors house across the street over my house.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Shortly after sighting the first &#34;falling star&#34; I noticed another one right behind it and on the same flight path. I began to focus more now on the &#34;falling stars&#34; and realized these were not falling stars but rather glowing orbs that were in full motion.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was now fixated on the orbs trying to identify what exactly I was observing.  Four more additional orbs followed along the same flight path (similar to a funeral precession) behind the initial two.  The objects were moving at steady cruising speed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The objects could be best described as soft fireballs with a diffused type glow.  The orbs were completely silent (no engine noise) and all uniform in shape and size.  There was typical source of identification (i.e.red/green running lights that are common on commercial aircraft).<n> <n><n> <n><n> I can&#39;t say for sure that this was an E.T sighting.  However, I can say with certainty is that the objects weren&#39;t commercial air craft nor do I believe this was a natural phenomenon (I.e. meteor or falling star) due to the fact that the objects were all on the same exact flight path.<n>

And yes it was moving, I also told my self it was a satiate, then it went away like some one turned off a light, so I said to my self it was a asteroid, and as soon as a was about look away, it lit back up in the same spot it disappeared in and shot to my right  un realistically I ran in the house and told my wife I was freaking out, I never believed but now I&#39;ll never look at the sky the same again.<n>

The skies were uncharacteristically clear.  Not a cloud in sight. AT ALL.   I was driving north on the US HWY 101 when I looked up to see what looked like a white wingless airplane, flying at what appeared to be EXTRA-ORDINARY speeds directly West, towards the ocean.   Abruptly the craft stopped and sped back the direction from which it came, East, towards the mountains.    Then as abruptly as it appeared, it just vanished.  Into the air.    I was 10 miles south of Fortuna California, and I am not sure how high the craft was flying or how far ahead of me it was, as there was nothing to compare it too size wise.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I must add, being a small community that is relatively isolated, we only have three main roads in and out, and our small airport only handles a few flights a day, and they are all United, small airplanes, along with the coast guard crafts.   They fly over my property so I am extremely familiar with the type of aircraft that are normally seen in this area.    This craft was definitely wingless, tailless, windowless, silent(as far as I could tell) and as white as a cloud.     Small United Jets are Dark Grey and Blue, very identifiable, and pretty loud.  The coast guards crafts are all very loud, large, and orange/red.  I am 100% sure that whatever I saw was not either of them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The lingering thought/feeling I have is.   That sighting had to have been on purpose.    One would have to assume that if you are capable of flying a craft over the distances required to reach another life containing planet, you aren&#39;t going to accidentally spill your soda on the cloaking device in the control room, and accidentally make yourself visible.    It wanted to be seen by someone, for some reason.   I can&#39;t and won&#39;t guess as to why, but if you are chosen to go on an interstellar mission, I imagine that you would be one of the very best and brightest that the civilization had to offer.     I know we wouldn&#39;t be sending Bubba from the trailer park to another planet as part of a NASA flight crew, so why would they.     This had to be intentional.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The real question is why?  EVENT 2.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Kneeland California April 7, 2013 1915 hours 15-20 seconds single craft 2 witnesses.<n> <n><n> <n><n> white disc/cigar shaped craft   My brother and I were outside on our property watching the sun go down, over the Pacific ocean, and we noticed a jet flying at a high altitude over us.   We watched the contrail behind it disappearing, because with the sunset it made it look very unique.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Behind this jet there was another in the distance, flying at approximately the same speed and altitude, also leaving a nice contrail.   There was a couple of minutes distance between the two jets, but then their was a bright flash, between the two jets of a third craft, whose direction was intersecting their flight paths.   The jets were flying East from somewhere over the ocean and had flown by our airport, so it is unclear where they were going.     The other craft shone this bright white flash  (then it was obviously white, oblonged disc/cigar shaped) as it intersected(approximately) the path that the jets were going, it was flying north and south.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My brother and I both saw this, but I pointed it out first, then as soon as he saw it, my vision was overcome with spots.    I was unable to see anything but these spots for nearly 10 seconds, the best I can describe them would be clear, but all encompassing.    Like what it looks like when mosquitoes are dancing on the top of the water.  Then I was unable to see the craft anymore.  No more than 2 seconds after this happened to me, my brother said &amp;quot;oh man, i lost it.   I just see spots.&amp;quot;  He got hit with the same spots as I and that was the end of the sighting.  It happened so fast I wasn&#39;t able to say anything to him before he said it to me.   He thinks that it was some kind of cloaking, but I prefer not to guess.    I have no clue, so guessing doesn&#39;t do any good.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I consider myself to be level headed, calm, and rational.    I have never had any experiences like this before, although I have always believed in extra-terrestrial life.   It is egotistical, in my opinion, to believe that there isn&#39;t more advanced civilizations  spread throughout the vastness of space, let alone to believe that we here are on Earth are all the life there is anywhere.   That is aside from the point.    The point is that I don&#39;t just believe everything that people say, and if I wouldn&#39;t have had two separate sightings, one with my brother, who I trust wholly, I wouldn&#39;t have reported the first sighting.   Now I am compelled to report them.   However, I don&#39;t think I will be talking about this to other people at this time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My eyes will be towards the skies from now on though.<n>

I proceeded to stop my car to watch the event. The location was Huntsville, Alabama on Whitesburg Drive between Byrd Spring and Four Mile Post Road.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I clearly observed three yellow-white lights in a triangular formation around a central red light. They were on an object (presumably triangular, though I did not have time to discern a clear outline) that I could observe because there were no stars visible between the lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was absolutely no sound associated with the event, and I presume it could not have been any sort of conventional aircraft due to this fact and the altitude of flight (again, just above the trees on the corner at which I stopped).<n> <n><n> <n><n> The event passed slowly overhead until it passed out of view. I exited my car to look, but I could no longer see the event or any evidence of its passing. Although I cannot estimate the size of the event too accurately, it was well over twenty feet across by my best guess.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As a note, I do not tend to acknowledge the existence of extraterrestrials here on Earth, and I know of no sort of powered flight that could run so low and silently. This is why I refer to this phenomenon as an “event” rather than a “craft” or “object.” I can provide no explanation as to the cause of this event, however.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am currently a student studying fields of natural sciences, so I tend to favor no explanation rather than one that is fantastical in my opinion. I am somewhat familiar with what I would categorize as “U.F.O. lore,” but I do not treat it as fact. I have never used illegal drugs, and I was neither on prescription medication nor was I intoxicated at the time of this event. This was my first and only encounter with an event of this type.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Then another small blinking light came from the fireball, and followed the first blinking light, that I did not see if it in fact came from the fireball but I would think it did.  Both blinking lights were identical. I focused on the fireball which was moving a little faster now but still slow.  I ran upstairs and woke up my girlfriend and she witnessed the fireball the last 20 seconds as it stopped then appeared to flicker a couple times and slowly started to disappear.  There were a couple small light clouds in the sky but not near the fireball.  Last Christmas I saw a Chinese lantern which took me 20 seconds to tell what it was.  And this was no! t a lantern which I viewed for about 4 minutes. No sound heard.<n>

I didn&#39;t think much of it until I noticed another one about 300 behind it following the exact path.  I was in the middle of an important phone call and tried to focus my attention on the call.  I looked away for several minutes and was quite surprised to see the procession still in progress when I looked back again.  I saw three at a time moving up the hill and at this time, I stepped barefoot out in the snow to listen for them.  They didn&#39;t make a sound and more continued to follow. In all, I witnessed at least a dozen - probably 2 dozen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is located along Hwy 23, east of Fond du Lac, Wisconsin.  They were moving east. They seemed to turn and were out of my sight as they neared the top of the hill.  I plugged the description that I just gave you in my computer, expecting to something in the news.  Instead your site turned up.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I would not have reported it to you but I see some that they fit the same description.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My sense was that I was watching a parade...a solemn parade. They moved slowly and deliberately.<n>
3/14/13 21:00|Arcadia|IA|Fireball|3 minutes|Bright Orange Fireball near Arcadia, Iowa|8/30/13|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/100/S100610.html|219|ndxe201303| Bright Orange Fireball near Arcadia, Iowa<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was driving west on a blacktop road about 1/4 mile from Arcadia, in west central IA. It was about 9:00 pm central time. The sky was clear with visible stars and moon. The temperature was probably in the 30s. The moon was west and slightly south of the road.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object caught my attention due to its intense fire-like red/orange color. The upper edge of the object seemed to have a slight, vertical glare of color. My first thought was that something was on fire. I pulled over to the side of the road and turned off the engine with the window rolled down. The object was slightly south and closer to the ground than the moon, which was a very bright white. I realized that the object was not burning, as the color did not vary or flicker, and the shape of the object remained perfectly circular. I could not judge the height or distance of the object from my position. It appeared to be about the size of a penny held at arms length.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object was stationary at first sight. After approximately one minute it began to move eastward. I grabbed my camera and took a shot. I checked the shot and noted that the shutter speed was too slow, resulting in a photo with motion blur and light trails. I changed the settings but by this time the object had moved further east and behind some trees, and appeared much smaller. It moved east past the trees and then just vanished.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object made no sound. It moved in a steady direction without changing speed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This was unlike any aircraft I&#39;ve seen. There were no flashing lights, just a solid orb of color. We have fighter jets flying over from Omaha quite frequently, but they are extremely loud. I felt a great sense of amazement watching the object. I photograph landscapes frequently and am always looking at the sky for good light and clouds, but this was completely different than anything Ive ever observed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The first photo shows the position of the object in relation to the moon. The second is an enlarged portion of the first photo showing just the object. All of the light trails are due to the motion of the camera. The object itself had no light trail at all. The color of the object is very accurate when compared to what I saw.<n>

I would also like to add that we could hear rumbling almost like a train in the distance would sound that would come and go, it would even at times get so creep-ily silent..  I&#39;ve lived in this house for almost 26 years, this was definitely NOT normal<n>

3/14/13 20:30|Tucson|AZ|Sphere|2 minutes|Streaked in like a meteor only to slow down and break into 5-6 orbs, stop, hover 3 sec, dance up and down in the sky|7/3/13|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/098/S98958.html|222|ndxe201303| Streaked in like a meteor only to slow down and break into 5-6 orbs, stop, hover 3 sec, dance up and down in the sky<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was sitting on my couch facing my picture window when a huge fireball came streaking thru the night sky.   I jumped up off the couch telling my husband “it’s a huge meteor” and ran for the front door never taking my eyes off of what I was seeing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Even before I got to the front door 2 thoughts in secession went thru my mind.  The first was that this meteor was big and definitely gonna impact with a boom but then as I got closer to my picture window, which is right next to my front door, I had a second thought that this meteor did not look quite right.  What had appeared to be the fire tail just did not look like fire at all.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My husband had jumped up and grabbed his cell phone and was right behind me as I opened the front door.  As we stepped out onto the front porch this fire ball slowed down and slowly split into 5 or 6 very bright amber orbs and came to a complete stop hovering between my house and the Tucson Mt. range which is about 3 miles away.  I cannot tell you how long I would perceive this string of orbs to be except to say it was huge and would easily be seen in the night sky.   It hovered for about 3 seconds then turned itself horizontal and slowly sank behind one of the peaks of the Tucson Mt. ridge line.  It then came back up from behind the ridge still in a horizontal line but in a diagonal trajectory.  Slowly sank behind the ridge again and then came back up once more in a diagonal trajectory but only revealing 3 of it orbs this time.  It sank back down behind the ridge again and came up one last time only revealing part of 1 orb.  While we were watching this display take place my husband called his friend who lives on the other side of the Tucson Mt ridge (in town), he ran out to his back yard but did not see any lights dancing up and down in the sky.  I found that to be quite perplexing.  My husband was speaking with his friend while the orbs were still displaying themselves.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The next morning as I was leav! ing for work I noticed a smaller ridge between my house and th! e Tucson Mts. that I never really paid any attention to before and thought to myself that maybe these orbs were not actually dancing up and down behind the Tucson Mts but might possibly have been between this smaller ridge and the Tucson Mts.  A few days later I checked the internet to see if any one had posted any sightings and could not find any thing mentioned.  I am confident that had this happened where town could see it people would have been coming out of the wood work.  These orbs were huge and bright and seemed to be having some sort of fun time dancing up and down in the sky that night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date is approximate.

I had my two year old Grandson in my arms.  We were walking around the yard in the night air.  I looked up into the sky over my Sister’s yard next door and saw and oval shape in the sky that was darker than the night sky.  There were 8 or 9 cone shaped beams coming from this oval.  The type if shape you would put around a sun if you were drawing one.  Similar to this  0&amp;gt;.  They were a variegated red, orange and golden yellow.  Red being closest to the oval then the orange and then turning to yellow.  The beams did not protrude from what seemed to be the front of the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object or craft hovered for perhaps one to two minutes.  It had to be only a few blocks East of where I was standing.  Then slowly moved positions, heading North, stopped, hovered again then slowly moved forward North again.  Momentarily I could not see it behind my Sister’s house.  I walked to the front yard, laughed because here I was following it with my Grandson in my arms.  Watched it hover again for about the same period of time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My neighbor came out to bring her trash can to the curb and started talking to me.  I promptly brought he attention to the object in the sky.  She said, &#34;How strange.  Well there is supposed to be a comet tonight.&#34;  I then said, &#34;That is not a comet, a comet does not hover!&#34;  The comet then moved North again.  Stopped hovered shot something out of it.  What looked like it fired something out of it.  That was golden yellow and went for perhaps a few miles and dissipated.  Then it took off speeding North East.<n>

By chance I was looking out from the doorway when I spotted a long silver colored cylindrical shaped craft which was traveling south to north.  At first it was in the open air and then entered into a cloud bank. I ran in the house and grabbed my video camera and went back outside to get a better look. I focused on the craft which by now had emerged from the clouds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What I witnessed was a long cylindrical craft with no markings, wings or a tail fin. I ran back into the house agin calling to Barbie Heid to come outside to see it.  It was at this point that the craft changed its direction to a westerly heading. I tried to film it through the trees but the trees blocked my viewing partially.  I was fortunate enough to catch a few seconds of video footage of the craft which I would be glad to send you.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have to say with all honesty that the length of the craft was approximately the width of the sun from my viewing point in respect to its height, which was at cloud level.<n>

Also it moved on a straight line pattern it seemed to rotate on it&#39;s own axis very smoothly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I tried to pull out my cell phone which it is and old nokia with a 2 megapixel camera to take at least a picture of it, the phone froze in the middle of the shift from still pictures to video mode as the object commenced to descend behind the line of houses to the east from where I was looking. unfortunately I could not take photographs or video of it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Before the sighting I experienced trouble connecting to my wireless network, it could be a coincidence but indeed it was one of the reasons to go to the rooftop and water the plants, the other reason was that my dog was restless, hiding under the desk and overall seeming afraid.<n> <n><n> <n><n> To whoever it might concern:  To put things in perspective, here in the city where I live close to downtown we actually don&#39;t have buildings taller than 3 story houses.  downtown should remain colonial in its style the reason is some sort of french policy they tried to apply to the city planning a century ago.<n>

My 2 dogs jumped up and raced to the back door (their dog door is located there) and started incessantly barking.  I got up and decided to turn the computer off, because my work was saved,soI could try it again later.  I went to the back door and saw my dogs looking up towards the roof, barking anxiously, almost a howling bark…I tried to get them to come in, but they wouldn’t, so I came inside to get ready for bed.  After I was ready for bed, the dogs had stopped barking, so I got in bed, thinking that they would come in soon, anyway. I was on my side, facing my bedroom doorway.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The door was open and I could see the bathroom door directly outside the bedroom door at a right angle to the left.  I looked towards the door as I pulled the covers up, and saw a glowing green light emanating from the bathroom,  In the bathroom doorway, I saw a mass in motion…it seemed like a liquid, like an oil with another colored liquid swirling inside of it.  The light from inside the bathroom was illuminating it, so it was translucent green, and moving slowly, like the liquid in a lava lamp. I was stunned as I watched it turn dark and opaque as it started to form a shape.  I became scared as the shape started to form and I saw a small long thin arm, and what looked like a thin leg……I could not see see any more of the shape, because it was dark and the light had diminished. I closed my eyes.  My dogs started barking again, so I took a deep breathe and opened my eyes,to see only darkness around me. I ran out to get my dogs and stayed up the rest of the night, but nothing more! happened. Please post if any of you in the Santa Fe area have had a similar experience. I am having a hard time, wrapping my head around this…<n>
3/13/13 22:15|Pottstown|PA|Unknown|still present @22:52/unmo|Flashing red, green, blue, and white lights N. of Philly around base of a stationary aerial object with shallow cone shape|5/15/13|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/096/S96707.html|231|ndxe201303| Flashing red, green, blue, and white lights N. of Philly around base of a stationary aerial object with shallow cone shape<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was sitting in my living room, looking out the window into the night sky in the general direction of ENE (verified with digital magnetic compass as 105 degrees east of Magnetic North, at an inclination of approximately 45 degrees between the horizon and straight up.  I saw a prominent flashing light, which I began to pay attention to because there have been a lot of low fixed wing and rotary aircraft overflights in this area in recent days.  As I continued to watch the light, I noticed a flashing near the bottom edge, or perhaps underneath the primary light, which I have a sense of being vertical, and the light has been hovering in this position for over 35 minutes now, and is still there and unmoving, with the flashing continuing.  The lights which are flashing in an apparently random manner include red, blue, green, and white lights.  I first saw this object and the lights with my naked eye, and spotted the color flashes without any enhancement to my vis! ion.  Then, I called upstairs for my son to come down and look at the object, and at that time, while waiting for him to come down, I took a small set of 7x15 Binoculars and looked at the object through the binoculars. There also was the possible appearance of other, much smaller, moving objects, seen as white lights, approaching the object while others were moving away from the object.  These were not clear, but seemed to be occurring continuously throughout my observation. Everything I saw with the naked eye was still there, but somewhat enlarged by the binoculars.  In the last 5 minutes at approximately 2300 Eastern Daylight Time, I noticed a change in the object&#39;s position, to an inclination of approximately 55 degrees of elevation, and a lateral shift to a position further south, from 105 degrees Magnetic to approximately 115 degrees magnetic.  Upon fresh examination through the binoculars, it appears to have a shape similar to an inverted shallow cone with a broad bas! e and gradual curve to a relatively low height top to bottom, ! with the base being circular, and the lights definitely flashing around the circular shape of the base.  At this point I have been observing the object for 50 minutes, with only a verly slight, one time shift in it&#39;s position.  I will continue to observe this object throughout the evening to see if there are any significant events.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Plus, it was super dark.  The V-formation was traveling towards the northeast, while I was facing north.  The group of lights looked about the size of 4 small moons, or one large harvest moon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As the golden orbs traveled away, their triangular shape drifted into the distance until I could no longer see the objects.  A helicopter was in the area hovering around my house, one reason I had been looking up so much.  When I called  one of the news stations to report my UFO sighting, they said the helicopters were there because of a standoff, not because of what I had seen.<n>

However hawks in this area are brown and redish tinted not white, next thought what about seagulls, rarely common in this area though a possbility but that didn&#39;t sit right either, way to high up to be either hawk or seagul, even private owned prop planes from nearby ellington airport do not fly at that altitude, that and i can normally determine it&#39;s a hawk by the wing span, which no wings were present and giving the distance between us if it were a hawk given their size i should not be able to see them as clearly as i did.   during the duration of this, most of the time they appeared to playing in a diamond or square form! ation while swopping in corner to corner doing passes, this is when i ruled out birds and planes, it didn&#39;t seem as though they stopped, to signify they were turning while gliding, but rather they just instantly went in reverese, they did how ever seem to be drifting, it did not appear as though they were flying in a direction but drifting all the while rising higher.  I will not rule out the fact that maybe i simply saw birds at high altitude will also leave the option open that if they were birds they were not in any notion flying in a manor that i am used to seeing them, nor the fact that after they had risen to a point in which i could no longer see them, i waited to see if they would come back down to such a level that i could, in which they did not.<n>

About twenty minutes had passed when I went outside again to check the noise when I heard a very low humming sound , also had a turbo engine sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I looked down towards the end of my drive way when I noticed lights just above the tree line. I found my flashlight and walked to see what it was.  It was what appeared to be a black triangle with lights hovering about fifty feet above the trees.   The object was about an acre and a half in size , I could hear the low humming sound as well as a low sound turbo engine sound ,  it had lights all the way around the sides and as well as the bottom not sure how many .  It appeared a black metallic , as well it appeared to have multiple floors to it , I assume two by the way it looked.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was stationary and the lights did not blink, they were continuously lighted . I stood watching the object for about fifteen minutes while dog continued to go crazy barking. Then suddenly three round white circles came from the bottom and started traveling through the woods in what appeared a grid.   I then put my flashlight back on the triangle object and my batteries went dead.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I walked back to my house to get a camcorder to film the object but like the flashlight the battery which was fully charged went dead as well.  At that time I never saw the three white lights again.  The object slowly started traveling a north by northwest direction very , very slowly.  The engine sound did not increase, the object was headed toward Toledo Bend lake just over the tree line.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I then went to get my car to follow the object , I followed it about three miles to a marina on Toledo Bend lake. It slowly went across the lake until out of site.  Having worked at Fort Polk military base I assumed it might have been some type military plane.  I was heavy equipment operator at Fort Polk and had regular unrestricted access to the airport and I have never saw anything like that.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My dad had seen what he described as a similar object in the same location in 1997.  He often talked about it and I would be like “sure” .   I have seen the white lights before in the woods around my house on numerous occasions , no sound . The lights are not car lights, the booger man or bigfoot.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I know what I saw but I do not know what it was.  Working at the military base I have seen lots of aircraft but nothing that could stay stationary like the triangle object was doing . I did not call the police because I did not want to seem crazy . I was clear that night about forty two degrees.Also that night there were lots of jets in the air coming from the Fort Polk circling above the object at around twenty five hundred feet . I would estimate five to six jets<n>

When I first noticed something strange coming over the tree line from our North, I said look at that and my friend said, that&#39;s just a plane.  I said I don&#39;t know what it is but I don&#39;t think it&#39;s a plane, it wasn&#39;t very high but somewhere about where planes fly, we live close to an airport so it could have been, but then as it passed over head another one of these what looked like a fire ball came from the same direction and pattern than the first one and then another and another about 6 or 6 in all, as they got overhead they seemed to elevate out of sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My friend was able to take a picture with his cell phone and sent it to the local news channel where there had been numerous reports from others in the close surrounding, maybe within 25 miles or so from where we were.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Some had said it may have been Chinese lanterns from a wedding in the area but I don&#39;t think they were, they were pretty high and looked too big to be a little lantern.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

As we got to the end of our street I looked directly across the street and up.  About 50-80ft above the tree I saw three white orbs in triangular formation very close together.  It moved suddenly then stopped, it then shifted shapes and took on a form similar to a helicopters light pattern.  One of the lights even changed to a flickering red.  It started moving to our right before we even turned.  I proceeded to take my girlfriend to work which is in the same direction. Never taking an eye off it I turned as well.  I didn&#39;t put my blinker on for my next left turn. My gf keeping an eye on it the entire time, noticed that the craft turned back to our direction.We really got freaked after this.  Once the craft was back over us it started circling our vehicle as we went down the road.  It was following us.  At one point it shifted back into the all white three orb triangle, then back to the helicopter form before the nex! t main road.  We turned off our normal route and into the Wal-Mart parking lot and parked for about 13 mins watching it make a wider circle around the area.  We left the parking lot and got back on route.  Back on top of us circling again making every turn we make.My gf tells me she&#39;s not going to work to just keep driving.  We end up across town and rush into a friend&#39;s house.  Watching his surveillance cameras we watched the craft split into sections and one stayed visible on screen flickering and moving slightly.  We stayed there about three hours before we got the nerve to leave.  Once we came outside the craft vanished. We made it home with out being followed.  As far as we know.<n>
3/12/13 22:00|Port Orange|FL|Unknown|~30 seconds|Hovering lights, apparently a helicopter, with very dim lights and no discernible sound.|5/15/13|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/096/S96716.html|244|ndxe201303| Hovering lights, apparently a helicopter, with very dim lights and no discernible sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I saw a strange set of lights which seemed to be hovering over Dunlawton Avenue near the intersection of Clyde Morris Blvd.  I was driving west on Dunlawton.  I saw them above and in front of me.  They drew my attention because they seemed unusually dim for an aircraft that apparently low. I first tried to determine if the apparent lack of motion was because the craft was moving away or coming toward me, but  I drove under it without it seeming to move. As I drove under, I lowered my window and listened for the sounds of the engine or rotors of what I assumed at that point was a helicopter.  I couldn&#39;t hear anything over the street sounds of the traffic on the road.  I lost sight of the lights as I continued to drive west. The night sky was cloudy.  The lights were muted, about 4or 5 of them, white and blue I think.  The altitude of the lights was such that I could see the lights clearly, but not the craft they were on. My best w.a.g. is 1000 feet or so.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This may be nothing unusual. I just wanted to report it in case it corroborates a better report of the same object.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

My dog barked once and settled back down on the bed.  The bright light lasted.  Only a moment and was replaced by two round bright orange ovals.  I could see the ovals through my bedroom window.  They were lined up in a straight line and appeared to be inches apart.  I wasn&#39;t scared, just very curious.   After a few minutes I fell asleep and all was well when I woke up.<n>

They were heading North from the South,in a single file line, no more than 1,000 feet out.  Which is directly on the coastline,and appeared to be no more than 1,000 ft in the air.It was Bike Week so we will be surprised if nobody else saw anything.  They flew in line like birds do,a few minutes apart,say 1-3mins.apart,headed North towards Jacksonville,FL.  I watched the last one until it left my field of vision,knowing that it flew a direct shoreline course to at least 20 miles North of my condo, at least past Flagler Beach, FL.<n>

At first I thought it was most likely planes, I looked again though and they were just stationary in the sky.   I have good vision and even using a tree in my yard as a fixed point could not find any movement from the objects. It seemed odd to me that they were so bright at such the distance they were at.  Almost like big flares in the sky but they kept dimming and then getting really bright but never faded. I then took out my phone to get a quick video of the lights.  Right after I put my phone away the light on the right started to move east, but didnt accelerate slowly it justs started moving at high speed instantly, I would say around 2-3 times faster than any commercial plane in the area at the time I could see.  Once that light was out of view the one on the left started moving to the west the same way, accelerating to a wanted top speed instantly and then just c! ruising along at that speed until out of view.  I stared at the lights in the sky for almost a minute before it took them roughly 10 seconds to both leave my view.<n>

The objects appeared suddenly to the south east about 10,000 ft in approx.., they appeared to keep stationary lateral from one another, then moved to the north and abruptly were gone.  I was involved in military, covert and civilian aircraft industries for 15 years, and I know aircraft, their systems, lighting variables and characteristics....these were unidentifiable from my knowledge, and almost appeared to be orange street lights flying. They disappeared as quick as appearing. the evolution lasted approx.. 5 minutes in duration.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was orange and slow moving, with no smoke and a very short trail.  It was much larger than any aircraft I have ever seen. It moved slowly from one corner of the window to another.  I thought nothing of it, that it was possibly a meteor, until reading reports recently that describe exactly what I have seen.<n>

From any make of aircraft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> These similar orange anomalies are seen in the Maricopa area quite frequently but not with such lateral movement as described in this report. The majority of  sightings are near the Palo Verde mountain range just west of the city of Maricopa, however what caught my eye about these anomalies is that they were east by southeast of Maricopa this time, and moving laterally until they disappeared instantly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have video evidence of the incident to coincide with this report. This is the second report Ive filed about this sighting, however the first seems to be not on your site, so I am making another report.<n>

We had been out there for about 30 minutes.  There were some clouds, but mostly it was clear and visibility was great. As my wife was looking straight up above us she noticed a bright flashing up high.  It flashed twice before telling me. I looked up and seen the same thing.  It would flash once, then pause about 3 to 4 seconds, then flash again. When it flashed, I could partially make out it was a triangle.  The flash itself was a brilliant one looking like the flash you see during welding with a plasma cutter. We both counted at least 6 flashes and it was gone.  It also moved fast, silent and made a turn unlike anything I ever seen. It came from the west and made a turn to the north.  My wife was getting her cell phone to video it, but it was gone.  We even seen a couple of Meteors flashing across the sky.  This was not a meteor.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Now, I am very well familiar with how aircraft fly, I have even flown myself. I am a retired Firefighter and know the dunes very well from doing rescues, firefighting brush fires and just playing in the dunes in our old Jeep. I&#39;ve never seen anything like this out there before. It was amazing and left us a little stunned. It was my second experience of seeing a &amp;quot;UFO&amp;quot; within my 58 years of life.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I hope this helps you in your trying to understand if we have extraterrestrials trying to contact us.<n>

Then we saw the red light flutering around in no real direction.  The main light was there for several hours.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Several weeks before this my daughter and I were leaving a family members house about 9:00 pm and we saw a very bright light at the other end of their street.  As we drove it seemed to be cutting across the field as we did. As we got onto our road it was crossing the field and by our house. By the time we got to our street closer to our home it was over the nieghbors field above the barn about 40 feet.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There seemed to be many colored lights going off and on in a circle patteren and then there was 2 very bright orangeish lights that were brighter and more like search lights. I stopped and rolled my window down that there wasn&#39;t any sounds at all. It was only maybe 60 feet above us. It didn&#39;t move for awhile. We got into the house  and watched it from in the window and it moved very slowly and disappeared in about 2 minutes.<n>

The craft we&#39;re observed thru &amp;quot;Fujinon&amp;quot; binocular&#39;s, and the observer is an experienced, and life-long identifier( amateur) of aircraft type&#39;s and configuration&#39;s, both military and civilian.   One Craft in particular (the last one) was scrutinized closely, as it passed directly over head before heading North. &amp;quot;It was identical to the other&#39;s, and as I watched it through the binocular&#39;s the flame&#39;s sputtered and went out to reveal a silver or white disc/saucer, with four distinct bump&#39;s on it&#39;s underside. I watched it move North, and it was clearly visible with the naked eye, until it was out of sight.&amp;quot;   All Craft exhibited the same characteristic&#39;s: constant speed, identical visually, flame&#39;s seemed to sputter and go out, but not all at once, but lasted for the same duration.  The weather at the time was very clear, 40-50 mile&#39;s visisbilty, and no cloud&#39;s. Craft we&#39;re at 2 mile&#39;s maximum from the coast, in loose trail formation, with about 1 mile seperation between craft. Craft appeared to be on fire, and when observed thru binocular&#39;s, it looked like lower 1/3 was on fire, and top 2/3 was billowy and white, like a balloon. &amp;quot;The color of the fire was dull orange, and when! I first saw it, I thought an airplane was on fire.&amp;quot;  All craft appeared to have very similar flight plan: they all appeared from the same location, they all went in the same direction, they seemed to be following each other.   They we&#39;re first seen appearing from Palos Verdes , and heading North, right over/around the LAX flight corridor. Craft left no contrail&#39;s, or smoke.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
3/10/13 20:00|Pacific Ocean (near Huntington Beach)|CA|Formation|6 minutes|Amber orbs journalist and witness video and loss of time near Huntington Beach Ca|5/15/13|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/097/S97492.html|259|ndxe201303| Amber orbs journalist and witness video and loss of time near Huntington Beach Ca<n> <n><n> <n><n> While driving down Magnolia Ave near the city of stanton, My friend/passenger pointed to the west and said &amp;quot;wtf is that?&amp;quot; I immediately pulled to a side street. I got out of my vehicle and did the only thing that seemed natural and pulled out my iPhone and began shooting a video of what I was witnessing which I will describe in a moment. I saw a man outside of his house and I yelled to him &amp;quot;look there up in the sky&amp;quot; he kept watering his grass mysteriously and ignored my voice as if he did not even here me- or he may have mumbled something I can&#39;t remember, but I know that I was already video taping when I called to that man watering his grass, however what I found on my camera was quite shocking- let me describe for a moment what we witnessed. 7 amber orbs in formation appeared to be hovering and were shooting what appeared to be lasers at one another. The lasers were blue green and yellow.  The orbs stopped abruptly shooting lasers at one another as a commercial jet liner was flying into what I believe John wayne airport. The objects were relative in altitude of the jetliner from my perspective however the objects could have been further away from the coast giving the perception that they were the same alititude. In fact it appeared the jetliner flew right passed the orb formation.  The orbs began to rapidly fade and vanish first 2 at a time then 3 at a time then 1 then 1 so a total of 7 lights that I could see. These lights may have been attached to a bigger object however due to the darkness of space I could not be sure how many objects were in the sky vs how many lights may have come from the same source.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Now back to my video that I believed had the smoking gun of my evidence.  The video that I shot ran for over 3 minutes, but when I played it back it only had 30 seconds  and the commercial jetliner was in view.  I did realize when I began to film that there was a street light making things more difficult to see the lights so I repositioned myself next to the guys house that was watering the grass. I remember getting back into my car and looking at the time thinking to myself did we lose time?  That could explain why my phone only recorded 30 seconds instead of 3 minutes.  And might also be the reason the guy ignored my yelling to look in the sky…  It&#39;s difficult to say what happened. My friend/passenger has become distant and depressed since the sighting,  I however have become charged with curiosity and am desperately looking for someone independant to digitally comb through the 30 second video for clarity.  I want to not that I am a journalist and I have been threatened at my j! ob for wanting to report this.  Please get in contact with Peter davenport if you know someone or you can fine tune this video.  This is not a hoax and I can prove it!<n>

When it came closer it stopped and probable stayed in one spot for up to 20 minutes. During this time the man next to me said that he can see another smaller craft that glows bright red colour coming out of the original ship. Apparently the glowing red craft (smaller one) went into the cloud. I couldn’t see it myself as my vision isn’t that good. I wasn’t really sure if he was telling the truth.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After some time another man came to the scene and the first man said again that the red craft has re-appeared again and is circling the original craft. The second man confirmed in front of me that he could indeed see the red glowing craft. Unfortunately, I couldn’t spot it with my bad eyes. After that I believed that there was another craft present at the scene. Mind you both space ships were very high in the cloud. The first man that initially told me that there is something in the sky told me that he believes that the original craft (in the photo that I have sent you) would be the size of a large bus.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After about 20 minutes the original craft started going west (without any engine sounds) and became more and more distant from us. It gained altitude above the clouds and eventually disappeared in a very high cloud out on my site.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Can you please examine the photo I have sent and tell me what you people think about my experience. I also have a short video…<n> <n><n> <n><n> Regards<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We have corrected the date above.  PD))<n>

It was moving at about the pace you would see an airplane in the sky moving, but there were some significant differences.<n> <n><n> <n><n> First, this thing was massive, maybe the size of 5 airplanes in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Secondly, this flying object was not lit up at all and was very difficult to see (you wouldn&#39;t even notice it if you were just glancing at the sky).<n> <n><n> <n><n> I couldn&#39;t believe what I was seeing and expected it to  be gone in a flash, but after a few seconds I called out for my girlfriend to come see and she came out.

At first i thought i was just seeing things, like 3 -5 seconds later the green light comes back and so i look out of my window and i see a very bright green oval object for half a second because it was moving and lost its view because of my roof the second i saw that i ran out of my car to get a better view but the second i opened my door the entire sky lit up as if the sun was green, thats how bright it got. It was like an adjustable light in your kitchen.  It started off very faint then exponentially got brighter to the point the green was begining to turn like a bright white and then instanly went away and went back to a dark night.  I even saw the clouds shinning green. the craziest thing i have ever seen. so i ran out to the side walk and realized that i was not the only one that saw it because 2 of my neighbors saw the same thing i did. n! o sounds either<n>
3/9/13 22:05|Portland|OR|Triangle|45 seconds|Three triangular bright orange light objects hovering low in the sky: Portland, Oregon.|5/15/13|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/096/S96732.html|273|ndxe201303| Three triangular bright orange light objects hovering low in the sky:  Portland, Oregon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At 10:05pm, I walked out of my home and saw three very bright lights hovering low in the southern sky.  All three of these light objects were distinctly triangular in shape.  Each of the three objects were projecting bright orange light in the center surrounded by bright white light at the outer edges. The lights were extremely bright and were facing due north. The orange/white light of each was constant and did not blink or flicker.<n> <n><n> <n><n> From my vantage point, they were visible slightly above the roof line and to the left of house across the street from mine. These three lights were hovering far lower than any aircraft I&#39;d ever seen in the downtown Portland skyline . The lights were large enough in the sky that they appeared to be possibly fewer than several miles away in the distance.  I noticed all three of these shapes were slightly swaying in a back and forth  in a fluid horizontal motion but stayed the same size, and kept the same position in the sky. This lasted approximately 45 seconds after which time,  within three seconds, all three of the lights moved very close together without touching, rapidly decreased in size (but without out moving from their relative position in the sky) and then proceeded to completely vanish from the horizon. During this occurrence I also I observed that there were two aircraft with blinking red lights flying in the southern sky from east to west. The two aircraft were fl! ying much further off in the distance and appeared to be moving at a constant speed which I considered to be consistent with commercial aircraft. I heard distinct sound from the two aircraft in the distance but did not hear any discernible sound from the three other light objects that I witnessed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Note: My home is located 4.5 miles North or downtown Portland, Oregon. I am a 36 year old mother of two, I formerly worked in the field of counseling, and I have never before observed anything unusual in the sky. I took one photo and one short video clip with my camera phone. The objects appear white and round in the images I captured, which may be due to the image quality.<n>

It was a clear night with plenty of stars. I spent some time focusing on different parts of the sky. At about 9:15 pm I put the telescope away, went back outside and I saw what appeared to be 7 to 9 rectangular gold objects, all traveling north in a formation like birds might do, but in one diagonal line.  These objects were below the clouds and appeared to be very large in size.  From where I was standing, I could cover one of them with my thumbnail.  It appeared that the objects were equal size and distance from each other, perfectly parallel. These objects were identical: gold and almost transparent in color, and they seemed to be speckled and have a rough texture. There was a constant light coming from each of them, like a glow or illumination.  The objects were illuminated but there were no singular lights on the objects. I did not hear any noise or sound coming from the objects in the sk! y like you might hear from a plane, jet, or helicopter.  I watched these objects move until they were out of sight, about 12 to 15 seconds.  I have not been able to explain what I have seen as it is nothing like I have experienced before.<n>
3/9/13 21:12|Portland|OR|Fireball|2 minutes|Light? Fireball?|5/15/13|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/096/S96601.html|278|ndxe201303| Light? Fireball?<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was on the front porch and happened to look up, just to the North of our house, and saw an orange colored light, moving from North to South. It made no noise whatsoever. I ran to the front door and told my girlfriend to come outside quickly, which she did. The light was sill approaching our vantage point and moved almost directly overhead.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The oject seemed to be moving parallel to the ground, on a flat trajectory. There is no wind tonight and the sky is cloudless. There were no aircraft in the vicinity at the time of the sighting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> If I had to guess, I would say the object was about 1000 to 1500 feet above the ground.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When it got just past us, at one point it kind of slowed for a couple of seconds and moved slightly towards the East, then sped up again and continued to travel South. It seemed to me to be traveling somewhat faster than a single engine civilian airplane would at that altitude. The light seem to fade an brighten very slightly at regular intervals. It faded out then disappeared completely as we watched it. The whole sighting probably lasted for two minutes, from about 21:12 to 21:14 hrs.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We could not see any larger object surrounding the light, it was noiseless, moved at a constant speed and altitude, and was moving much to fast to be a Chinese lantern. To sum up the event, it was just very strange!  We live within about 5 miles of the Portland Airport, and constantly see commercial, military and private aircraft at all times of the day and night. I have never witnessed anything quite like this, including other UFO’s that I have seen from the same vantage point.<n>

I live about a block off of  278 highway in Cullman.   To my amazement there was colored lights in the air    following the path of 278  .  The first formation was a group of five which was scattered out and then they changed formation to two front lead craft with the other three making a then forming a straight line behind them.  They looked like upside down diamond shapes with the bottom of the craft being the darker part with the light becoming brighter and more translucent as it got to the  oval top of the craft. Each one was a different color, there was  reds, greens, blues, gold’s, purple.  All were glowing lights.  It was like watching a Christmas parade in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then right behind them was a formation of three more and then right behind them was one lone  last craft.  I was jumping up and down when this one came by yelling come see me land here, and it slowed down and stalled for a moment then went by.  They were probably  saying look at that crazy human.  But I really want to meet them in a conscious state. I  have  so many questions.   Not a whisper of a sound came from them,  I was very close to their  path, at the altitude they were at and as clear as I could see them they had to each have been about 50 to 60 feet in diameter . You could tell that they were intelligently controlled  as you watched them change directions.  The were not moving very fast possibly about 40 mph.  It was slow enough that I got a really good look at them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Just past where I live they all took a sharp 90 ° turn north and then went invisible.<n>
3/9/13 21:00|Bowling Green|OH|Formation|~1 minute+|Formation of twinkeling and moving amber lights seen at night.|5/15/13|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/096/S96586.html|280|ndxe201303| Formation of twinkeling and moving amber lights seen at night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was jogging tonight when I looked off to the west and noticed two bright, twinkeling, amber colored lights which apeared to be hovering in the distance. I cannot say how far away they were or what size they actually were but they became smaller and unvisible shortly after I noticed them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A few minutes later I looked off into the same spot in the sky I had first seen the two lights and then there were three of them in a triangular formation. They were amber colored and twinkeling as before. I saw the lowest one actually moving upwards while the others stayed at about the same altitude but seemed to be moving horizontally so these were not flares. The lower light appeared larger than the others.  As the two upper lights dissipated the lower light remained and then later dissapated as well until it could no longer be seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have seen many aircraft at night so am familiar with what helicopters and planes look like in the night sky and sometimes they do look rather strange if you see them at the correct angle with there lights on. I have also seen metorites streeking across the sky numerous times.  These lights I saw tonight were markedly different from anything I have actually witnessed. I did not hear any engine noises accompanying these lights but since I did not know how far away they were I cannot say for sure that they were not helicopter pilots playing games with bright lights. At this point this sighting is a mystery to me.<n>

I first thought it was a plane or helicopter that police use but it had no  anti collision lights on it as per FAA regs and the whole thing seemed lit with up a strange light unlike a chopper.  It hovered in the area then veered west slightly and desended fairly fast almost looking like it landed not far away.  I was tempted to go and check it out but was too tired and it was too cold. It may just have been a kids toy remote controlled helicopter with a light on it but the light seemed rather bright for a toy. I guess its just Unidentified.<n>

The objects were flying northbound from the southeast. The objects were approximately 20+ thousand feet. I am a private pilot and I used commercial aircraft flying above as a reference.  Aircrafts usually flies between 35 – 40K feet. I also spotted several flocks of seagulls flying.  I used them as reference as a determining factor that the objects where not birds or planes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My only guess was the seagulls were using current winds aloft to glide. I later debunked that theory after researching.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I did take several pictures, unfortunately only one came out.

He looked and freaked out like I did.  Right after he looked it flew away and higher and we watched it for about five minutes so high up it looked like an airplane minus the blinking. It went really far really fast.<n>

I pointed it out to the group.  It was explained away as a helicopter with a spot light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I continued to watch the fire object and again asked my friends what was that, it was now moving off very slowly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We all went in the house and a few minutes later, someone went outside and called to us that now there were 6 fireballs in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We all raced out and when I got there I saw the original fireball and then a small distance away a diamond formation of 4 fireballs.  The people that got out there first saw another one, but it had vanished in the few seconds it took for me to get there.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I personally witnessed with my friends something I can not explain logically and have not been able to get this out of my mind since last night.  I tried to report it on my iPhone right after to the local wpbf news, but when I hit send the phone was unable to connect to the  Internet.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Later, we went back outside and saw a white streak in the sky that looked was spanning quite a long distance.  It was not a cloud nor was it exhaust from a plane.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This was a distinguishable white spanse in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I did get a picture off that on my cell.

As usual, there were a number of planes in the air traveling west to east as the landing path for Chicago Midway Airport passes directly overhead.  The planes typically have a white light with blue and red flashing lights on the wings.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I was driving, I looked out of my car window to the north and there were three very bright orange objects in the sky.  The objects were traveling east to west, the opposite direction of the plane traffic.  They were at a lower altitude than the planes and were bunched together traveling in a line at the same speed.  They appeared to be very low flying planes, but they were too close to each other and not the right color to be planes.  After a few seconds the leading object changed direction and started moving in a northerly direction while the other two continued in the westerly direction.  When the first object changed direction it appeared to have fire coming out of it.  Within ten seconds they were out of my view after continuing on their respective paths (2 to the west and 1 to the north) at a high rate of speed.  I am not a trained eye, but the objects appeared to be airplane sized, traveled at low altitude and were moving at least as fast as the planes in the sky if! not faster.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The lights were significant enough that the traffic in front of me on a very busy highway stopped to look at them nearly causing a traffic accident.  The skies here are very congested with planes flying into O’Hare and Midway, medical helicopters and private planes from several local airports, but these did not have any of the characteristics of a plane or helicopter and clearly stood out as people were stopping to look at them.<n>

There were two large green glowing ovals behind the craft and a flashing red beacon (which of course possibly signifies an aircraft of some kind).  I had never seen anything like it and have researched it myself on the internet and can find nothing like it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It proceeded in a northwestern path until out of sight.  I could not make out what the vehicle might have been as the two green ovals are what really caught my eye.  The back drop of the dark clouds and the sheer darkness made the lights standout but made identifying the craft very difficult.<n>

It began to slowly, silently arc across the sky.  I then noticed a second, similar object, quite far away from the first, but also moving in the same direction.  Both objects seemed to dissipate as they moved eastward.<n>

I’ve read up a lot on this particular subject and I can say this (these) object(s) was truly unidentified.  I was riding in a car (minivan) with my mom, my little sister (nine), my little brother (nine months) and my two younger sisters in the back, both under five, fast asleep.  My mom has always kind of ridiculed my belief in UFOs (I’ve seen one before), so I at first thought she was joking when she said, &#34;I think I found your UFO.&#34;<n> <n><n> <n><n> After she said she was serious several more times, I finally looked out a window, and saw nothing.  She described what she saw to me, she said she saw three little glowing orange lights ahead of her, much bigger than stars.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I looked out my window, and to my side I saw one as well.  We travel a lot very near to the Denver Airport so we both know what airplanes look like at night.  We live in rural Colorado so we both know what stars look like at night.  We were driving over La Veta pass at the time, and there weren’t many stars in the sky yet.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My first guess was airplane, but it looked absolutely nothing like an airplane, once I got a good look at it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My second guess was ball lightning.  But there weren’t any clouds, and it hadn’t rained in a good week.  I was almost completely at loss. The more I thought the more I thought they were TRUFOs.  They disappeared one at a time, until they were all gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I’ve seen helicopters at night, weather balloons, and all sorts of things.

At first we just commented on how low they must be, but once we heard them again only seconds later, we headed outside to check things out.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The first thing we saw seemed to be a very high and extremely fast jet.  It was going at an extrodonary rate of speed!   Within a few seconds we saw another one behind it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They came back from the other direction this time and then again crossed back across the sky.  They seemed to be in pursuit of something, but we didn&#39;t see anything.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Suddenly we realized that they were both heading toward the exact same point.  It looked as if they were going to collide!  It really felt like we were watching an action movie!  After appearing to very narrowly miss each other, one of the &#34;objects&#34; began to zigzag.  It was a very strange sight.  At this time both of them crossed the sky again and flew out of sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> While we watched them disappeared we saw another different kind of craft appear.  We didn&#39;t see which direction it came from and it was almost like it appeared out of nowhere.  It didn&#39;t make a sound like the others had, and it was traveling in the opposite direction.  It was obviously huge!  It was very high in the sky yet was still twenty or more times the size of a star.  It had lights--three prominent ones that seemed to form a triangle.  The lights seemed to alternate with blue in one spot at times and red and white at other times.  It made its way smoothly through the air.  It was a totally different looking form of flight than the other crafts we saw before.  We watched until it disappeared, which felt like forever.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I immediately went inside and sent out a text to close family members(at the risk of sounding totally crazy) and informed them that we had just seen a ufo and what looked like military jets attempting to intercept it.  I expected to get a few &#34;lol&#34; responses, but instead got a phone call from my sister who had also seen a strange occurrence in the sky probably 45 minutes before us.  She described seeing a large object in the sky that she couldn&#39;t quite place, and said that it just disappeared right before her eyes.  It startled her to the point of calling her husband right away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What we saw tonight was unlike anything I&#39;ve ever seen.  I felt sick to my stomach and there was a sense of urgency in the air.  At one point I asked my husband if I needed to go inside and gather the children in a safer location.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I guess we&#39;ll never hear about it on the news or even find out what was really going on, but I believe we witnessed a ufo and attempted military intervention.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke via telephone with the witness, and she seemed to us to be exceptionally capable.  We suspect that she is an excellent witness.  PD))<n>

I looked up &amp; saw a cigar shaped object with 3 lights on the bottom of it. 2 white lights (1 at each end) &amp; 1 flashing red light in the center. It continued on over my head &amp; as it got just past me I could not hear it anymore. I stepped off my porch &amp; followed it thru the yard. I watched it keep going across my parents house next door &amp; keep traveling along the edge of the mountain. It was not moving very fast at all. It was not very high above the tree tops on the top of the mountain. It did not sound like a plane or definately not a helicopter!  This is the 2nd strange encounter I&#39;ve had this week!  Both at my home in Brookside.  Tuesday night March 5th &amp; Thursday night March 7th.  What is going on?!?!<n>

I kept studying it, and studying it and as we kept driving the light would shine through the trees. The person in the backseat said that it was a star but i was thinking that it was too bright to be a star. So my eyes never left the object in the sky.  As we got closer to my house we got closer to the object.  I then noticed that a little red light was flashing on the right side of it.   Then i started to look under it to see if it was a telephone tower but nothing was under it. I could see like sometime dark under the light that it was giving off and i kept saying &amp;quot;it looks like its hovering, it looks like its hovering&amp;quot; and then i pulled in my drive way and noticed police blue lights behind my house and then i stopped looking at the object. It kind of scared me because i followed! it with my eyes for a good 2-3 miles and it stayed in the same spot it looked like.  However the sky was clear that night. It was hovering right over a red light and a neighborhood.  One i got close enough to it to see, it looked like it might of been moving very slowly, but like i said almost hovering.  However there was what looked like an airplane a lot higher above it.<n>

I immediately noticed two blue pulsating orbs that seemed to come at great speed and then slow over adjacent field.  As I continued to observe said pulsating orbs I began to notice a latticed clear sheath surrounding them.  First orb once nearly 3/4 of a mile away seemed to take off at 40 degree angle, second orb barrel rolled and returned to my vehicle, hovering approximately 200ft away &amp; 80ft above the ground, pulsating as a heart does.  I then began to notice a large clear sheath extending from orb with orb pulsating on on one side.  I can only describe it as a large hovering jellyfish that seemed to be alive.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Two men were outside a pickup about a half mile back.  Sighting was absolutely other worldly &amp; I slowly drove away.<n>

I proceeded to look around the sky and saw another plashing object above badger mountain.  I then watched the one in the direction of southwest, and that when just suddenly disappeared. shortly after I saw a shooting object fly from the direction of badger mountain.<n> <n><n> <n><n> at this point in time I noticed air traffic came to screeching hault.  shortly after planes began to fly throught he area again only to be stopped by another flying oblect it seems.  I had been watching the oblects for so long I could actually make out their signals to one another.  one oblect would flash multiple colors, green, red, blue, purple and then dim to one white color.  and then a corresponding object would then flash its colors.<n>

I watched it for 30 seconds moving from West to East.  Then it just disappeared. I just assumed it was an airplane or jet, etc.  But just then a plane passed over. It was moving from South-West to North-East.  It was much slower; I followed it in the sky for upwards of five minutes. I also noticed the noticed that accompanied the plane, like air wake.  The UFO had no noise. The plane also just continued out of view beyond the roof top.  Whereas the UFO just was gone in the blink of an eye.  I then realized what I had seen was a UFO and immediately told my father who told me to report it… While laughing at me…<n>

There was a row of lights on the side facing me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This object was moving slowly to the west and was likely two or three miles away initially. I was moving about 50 mph due south.  As I proceeded I got to see the object, which was losing altitude, from behind and below and I was stunned at the shape.  It was rectangular, with no lights visible on the side facing away from me.  The shape was completely inconsistent with a passenger aircraft.  (See my video on you-tube for a simulation).  I never saw any landing lights or navigation lights, just the row of lights on the three sides and the one strobe light. Finally, the object appeared to be turning north right as I lost sight of it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I would estimate about a 4:3 ratio of length to width.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Video simulation: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Mz1E9fKA48&amp;list=UUiEaWQaRf0rNRDMbxCPNVTA<n>

This doesn&#39;t happen very often at all! I walked out the door to see what I could see, noticed the plane with red flashing lights.  It was going northwest and disappeared. As I was looking at the stars, I noticed an unusually bright object in the sky. At first I thought it was a plane because you could see it moving and appreared to be coming my way. Then it stopped. Red, yellow and blue lights were flashing from it as though it was a balled up rainbow. It would fade in and out of view. I ran to get binoculars and focusing in on it discovered there were two objects side by side. There was no moon shining at that time. I kept watching it by naked eye, then binoculars for approx. 5 minutes. I could barely make out the outline of a large fir tree so kept that in focus, as trees do not move. These objects kept moving.First  up and down then back and forth. They would also move away from ea! ch other, but always came back close again, Always colorful and flashing. They were very close together, but focusing on another star and keeping the binoculars very still, you could see them distance themselves then come back again closer to each other. At first they were to the left of the little dipper and the tree I had in focus. Then they gradually moved to the right of the little dipper and of the tree. I watched for over an hour till I called the local TV station. They recommended I videotape what I saw. My camcorder is broken so was not able to. They told me they would check it out. In the meantime, I got on FaceBook and found a friend that lives 5 miles from me. I explained what I seen, told her what area to look in and she seen the same things. I watched these objects for over 2 hours slowly going back and forth across the sky.All the while the lights kept flashing. Every couple of minutes they would fade away a tad, but then would be bright again. This was a very! clear sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Possible twinkling star??  PD))<n>

The winds are in fact blowing from NNW.   However, I believe I reported the direction incorrectly in my original report as NE to SW.  After looking more carefully at a map I realized that the objects were coming from the NNW so it is possible they are lanterns.  I will call the FAA tomorrow to see if I can get wind speed data.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I apologize for my mistake, but like many women I&#39;m a bit &#34;direction-ally challenged.&#34;<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thanks so much, ((name deleted))<n>

I immediately told my brother what I was seeing over the phone,and I told the owners of the store,a husband and wife, to look up, and they both saw it too.  One of their friends who was seated to the front of the store also saw the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After about 2-3 minutes ,the orange glow that the object was emitting faded,and I saw quite clearly that the object had a distinctive diamond shape,and appeared solid,and looked white in color.   It made no audible sound,neither were there any other lights(navigation/anti-collision),so it definitely was not a conventional aircraft.  I, along with the other 3 witnesses h! ad the object under observation as it proceeded through the night sky which was very clear, and it headed in a Southerly direction over the Gulf-Of-Paria,until my view of the object was obscured by some trees on a nearby hillside.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides little contact information.

I&#39;ve listend to the news and online to find out what it was, but nothing has been reported. I only just now heard that this seems to be something other than what I thought it was, so I&#39;m reporting it. Like I said, it was 6-8 very bright orange/yellow fireballs over the mountains due west of town. It only lasted about 3 seconds and they looked like the went out very quickly thereafter, only a couple more seconds after they appeared. Nothing seems to have been reported about them and I haven&#39;t heard that anyone else saw them<n>
3/6/13 19:15|Katy|TX|Diamond|20-30 minutes|Saw 10 noiseless UFO's that changed from an orange ball to a white ball to a diamond shaped craft traveling in a straight line.|5/15/13|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/096/S96553.html|329|ndxe201303| Saw 10 noiseless UFO&#39;s that changed from an orange ball to a white ball to a diamond shaped craft traveling in a straight line.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was outside just after dark with my kids and noticed a strange round white light in the distance toward the small airport near my house(it would also be the direction toward NASA&#39;s Johnson Space Center but I have no idea how far they had traveled or if they were visible before I saw them).  The area where we live is just off FM 1093 heading west out of Katy, and although it is growing fast, it is still dark enough to see quite a few stars and some planets most nights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first, I thought it was Venus but after a couple of minutes watching it, I realized it was much too large and bright. Around this time I first noticed it slowly moving.  The first thing I noticed was that it was moving way too slowly to be an airplane and it also seemed much lower than the planes we normally see.  Living next to an small local airport for the last six years, small planes above our house are quite commonplace as well as commercial jetliners out of Houston-Hobby.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After it had moved closer, another orange light appeared some distance behind the first. As it came closer the bright white light on the first went out but was replaced by flashing colored lights on the left, rear, and right points of what at first I thought was a backwards triangle.  Around this same time the 2nd orange light turned into a white light exactly like the first.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So now there is a black triangle/diamond(?) shaped craft, making no noise, tracking slowly across the sky heading NW.  At about the time the 1st passed over my neighborhood, the bright light on 2nd changed exactly as the 1st had changed.  There was also another hovering white light by this time in the original location and another seperate orange (4 craft total at this point). All were tracking the same straight path and were maybe 1/4 - 1/2 mile apart in the sky.  All went through the same sequence of ball-of-light to noiseless-black-triangle.  All moved much slower than a normal large jet out of hobby and they seemed to be much larger and lower to the ground than one of Hobby&#39;s jets as well.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My 6 yr old son saw them and said that they were UFO&#39;s.  I told him they were probably military and I think I probably still believed this at the time. Around this time I noticed that my neighbor across the street was on his porch talking to another neighbor. I knew my wife would never believe me and I didn&#39;t think my cell phone would take very convincing pictures so the kids and I went across the street. There were several kids in their front yard that my son knew, so while he and his sister played with them, I asked them if they had seen the crazy lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They said no and I realized that they couldn&#39;t see the bright white lights from their yard for my house.  Just as I was about to say the heck with it, one of the diamond/triangles came over exactly as the ones my son and I had seen.  I pointed at it and my neighbor immediately said, &amp;quot;That&#39;s no plane, it&#39;s shaped like a diamond.&#39; The angle from his yard or the lighting must have been different a little bit different because now I could clearly see that it did have four corners although the front corner did not have the same flashing lights as the other three corners.  Now I could also see a bulge in the center of the craft on the bottom and maybe the top had a bulge as well (thought I couldn&#39;t be sure).<n> <n><n> <n><n> All three of us saw the exact same thing as another three craft went over.  All three of us were basically the same demographically: in our forties with kids about the same ages.  Two or three of the older kids also saw it.  One of my neighbors was convinced it was one of the drones that have been in the news lately.  I think they were far to big to be drones.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We went home and I got the kids in bed.  My wife&#39;s brother called and i walked out into the backyard to talk to him.  At this time 3 more came along the same straight line(for a total of 10) exhibiting almost the same behavior as the first 7 with one exception.  Numbers 8 and 9, as they passed over my house, seemed to either speed up very rapidly just as they passed over my roof or perhaps they went dark.  Whatever the reason, I could not track them on the other side of my house as i had been able to with all the others.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The last one was the slowest and lowest of them all.  Since 8 and 9 had disappeared, i ran into the front yard just as 10 was flying over and I watched it for several minutes until it was just a dot on the NW horizon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have never seen anything like this before, although I have read several books and watched quite a few tv shows on the UFO phenomenon. I probably would have never posted this though, if it weren&#39;t for the fact that on Feb 4 of this year, here in Katy, someone else reported seeing 10 noiseless balls of light tracking in a straight line.  Maybe someone out there knows something about these sightings or another similiar one and will post something else.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A couple more random observations: One of the objects might have had a low noise (nothing like a jet) and another of the objects while it was still a ball appeared to emit some sort of lighted hazy fog (electrical discharge?) right before it changed to the diamond-shape.<n>

There was cloud cover and a slight drizzle. I noticed a single orange light in the sky coming from the east.  At first I thought it was a plane but there were no other lights or strobes flashing.  It moved at a constant speed (about the speed you would expect from an aircraft). I thought it looked odd and so called to my daughter to hurry out and see it.  We both watched it continue over our heads and move towards the west. It made no noise.  The light whilst constant seemed to move occasionally like a flickering, but not like a flame.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I thought of a Chinese lantern but I have seen these before and as the light passed over our head I would have expected to see evidence of this.  There was no wind that evening and the object seemed to have a purposeful flight direction, not floating in the way a Chinese lantern does.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After we observed it flying for about two miles it stopped and changed direction and headed back towards us.  I ran inside to get my binoculars but as I came out to the yard my daughter said it had disappeared.  I immediately went to the computer and typed ‘Orange balls of light’ into Google and saw a host of YouTube videos and sites saying and showing the same thing which lead me to this site to send a report.<n>

After 1-2 seconds, it popped back on. Then after being on for a few more seconds, it vanished again.

In the sky nearly overhead and slightly west of the Big Dipper I glanced the dimming of what appeared to be a star about the brightness of Jupiter.  I thought it may be an Iridium satellite flash that I have seen before so I kept looking at the area to see if I could find which way the satellite was heading.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Within about 10 seconds of the flash I saw a fast moving object approaching from the south-southwest glowing a dull reddish color – barely visible.  It was travelling much faster than a satellite and perhaps half the speed of what I originally thought was a meteor.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When the object got into the general vicinity of the original flash, it slowed and a made U-turn and then another before it disappeared, all within the span of several seconds.  I did not see any further trace of the satellite or the mysterious object.<n>

I was sitting in Seat 5A which would be the left side of the plane near the front.   Around 5:30 pm I was looking out the window and I saw an object which initially i believed to be a plane.   But I was curious so I kept watching it...It appeared to be heading towards my planes direction.   I remember noting the altitude of the  plane on the display screen on the seat ahead of me, which I had in map mode.  It became more and more evident as the object got closer that it wasnt a plane, as it got closer I noticed no smoke emissions coming from the object and it did not have any flashing indicator lightss which are required on all aircraft, civilian or military.  The object never got close enough for me to guage its exact shape but if i was willing to hazard a guess I would say it was rectangular in shape.  It was close enough for me to know it wasnt a propellor plane.  The object trailed off behind the plane and i craned my neck until I could no longer see it.  I don&#39;t think it got within a couple miles of the plane I was in. Let me remind you that it was a perfectly clear evening, not a cloud in the sky...absolutly perfect dusk with an ample amount of light left in the sky. Still staring out of my window it was 5 minutes after the sighting a military aircraft flew very close to the plane, im not a pilot by any stretch of the imagination but I know it was a fighter jet. It was possibly 700 m from the plane. In fact the pilot of the westjet flight lifted the wing on the side of the aircraft that i was on (which means he broke out of autopilot) as the jet passed. It couldnt have been because of the proximity because the jet was far enough away...The jet was heading directly in the direction of the craft that i had just seen. The jet had had a smoke trail behind it but not a th! ick one like a commercial jet...anyways i know I saw something! I can e xplain..THought i would share<n>

Sunday 030313 about 22:30 there were no stars in the very dark sky. I watch the sky all the time and there I saw a triangle or christmas tree shaped large lighted object. I could tell it was rather large yet it seemed to be really up high so it must have been big. It had several very very bright lights all around on it that were very white and a blue tint that looked almost like they had a pulse and shimmer. I couldnt stop looking at it because it was so unusual and beautiful and it never moved like a plane, rather it just stayed in one place with the exception of a little adjustment now and then or at least thats what it looked like. I am not sure how long it may have been there before I saw it but I watched it for about 20 minutes and left for a minute or two and when I came back it was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Monday 030413:  I was outside again about the same time 22:30 and again not a star in the sky that was visable to me and I was amazed to see this same beautiful triangle shaped object back and this time there were three and they were all exactly alike, it looked like every detail. The beautiful very bright lights, the shape and the distance from my view was they were all the same distance apart but placed in a pattern in the sky.  When I looked at them I had two of them in my sight but had to turn my head a little to see the third.  They were evenly spaced from one another. I may have seen a very dim 4th one further to the West out further closer towards the Great Salt Lake. I was so amazed at them all being a like and so beautiful and bright. I did notice at one point that one of them seemed to turn a little so thata its tip was not in line like the others like it had been. They just looked like very beautiful lighted christmas trees. I could tell the lights were also very lar! ge because you could see some distint circles. I felt like they were up really high yet they were big. The lights were also very clear and bright without any haze. I left for about an hour then went back out and saw that one was still there just oved a little bit but still very bright and the others were very dim like maybe now further away or something. I watched them for about another 20 minutes and got cold and went to bed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was in Sunset looking up and out towards the Western sky.  The brightest one looked like it was almost over me but the others were little scattered to the West.  The Great Salt Lake is out to the West just a little distance away.<n>

I was unable to pull over at the time but by the time i did it was gone again.  There was no sound from the sphere of light or fireball light.

I could not see the shape of the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I yelled to my husband and he came out to witness.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We saw the lights going away fast.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Never seen anything like it.<n>

3/2/13 22:20|Hartly|DE|Circle|5 minutes|Unidentifed Flying Object Distant Sighting Leading to an Up Close and Personal Encounter- Constant Glowing White- 150 ft away.|4/12/13|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/096/S96517.html|364|ndxe201303| Unidentifed Flying Object Distant Sighting Leading to an Up Close and Personal Encounter- Constant Glowing White- 150 ft away<n> <n><n> <n><n> The sighting-encounter occurred in Hartly, DE 19953 on March 2, 2013 between 10:20-10:25pm.  The sighting occurred while i was driving east on Bryant’s Corner Rd, Hartly, DE.  Specifically, the object was seen/noticed far in the distance (south direction) while passing 671 Bryant’s Corner Rd.  At that point I saw a fairly bright white glowing object to my right, moving east in the sky.  It’s fairly large size and bright white glow was very eye catching, I could not help to notice it as I drove.  At that point, compared to a full moon and from my perspective, it was approximately 1/5th the size of a full moon.  As I drove east on Bryant’s corner roughly ¾ mile from the original viewing at 671, approaching 1600 Bryant’s Corner, the object appeared much closer but remained high in altitude directly south of my location.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At that point I was very interested in the object and while it appeared fairly close, there was no outside noise whatsoever.  Foolishly, I flashed my headlights multiple times in a joking manner seeking to get its attention, while I was in a clearing and before I entered the wooded area along the road.  As I drove through the wooded area and sharp bends I saw its bright white glow directly to my right and just below the tree line.  However, it looked very far away yet not high in altitude. Shortly after I looked away and thought to myself, &#34;Maybe when I get into the clearing I might be able to see it better.&#34;<n> <n><n> <n><n> I turned the final bend and exited the wooded area driving approximately 40mph. At this point on my left I was passing 2307 Bryant’s Corner Rd. At that point I saw the bright unidentified object to my right (south direction) making a half circle, just gracefully swooping down. In a matter of seconds it was less than a quarter mile away and approximately 500 feet off the ground. Its trajectory made it evident it was moving toward and in front of me. I was horrified when I realized this object was completely silent and not of any known aircraft whatsoever, moving toward me and in front of me and my safety could be in serious danger if I continued east on Bryan! t’s Corner.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At this point I would describe it as 1/3 the size of a full moon. I slowed down a lot and hesitated on whether I should continue driving or turn around immediately. I reduced my speed to roughly 5mph as I looked in amazement and as it gently came closer and closer. At the climax of the sighting the object moved in and floated/hovered directly in front of me, blocking me from driving down the road without driving almost directly beneath it, roughly 150 feet away and remaining roughly 150 feet from the ground. The actual object looked about the size of one-two school buses stacked on top of each other. It is difficult for me to describe the exact size because of the radiating white light might have made it look larger. It was absolutely very close and I began to panic.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thoughts and emotions rushed through my mind, I felt as if it was just starring me down, waiting to see what I would do or if I would stop or get out of my car. I starred for about 10 seconds in total amazement and because my window was half way down I was absolutely certain there was no sound whatsoever and it was not a helicopter or any kind of known aircraft. It was way too large and bright to be any kind of balloon or prank. It moved in such a perfect and precise manner it could not have been anything other than intelligently controlled.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The white glow and radiating white light was like nothing I have ever seen, ever. It was so bright, amazing, and silent. Yet it was not blinding and did not hurt to look upon it. As it moved in front of me I felt as if it was just starring me down and watching me. The thoughts of my safety being in serious jeopardy and feeling helpless to defend myself completely overwhelmed me. All I could think about was how fast I could turn around and drive back in the direction I came, running away from it. I pulled in the driveway to my right, and before I quickly went in reverse I starred left looking directly at it. It was hovering there in the same place.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Its white glow was constant and did not flicker, it remained hovering in the same location as it had when it first stopped in front of me. I then reversed and began to drive away as fast as possible. I thought to myself, there is no way I can out run this object, I cannot believe something bad might really happen to me right now. I drove as fast as I could in the direction I had originally came, without looking back until I had driven a few miles. It dissapeared from my view when i drove away in the opposite direction.  By the time I looked back I did not see it anywhere in the sky and I drove directly home. The event was very shocking, amazing, and incredible.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Additional information: I first saw the object in the distant sky approximately 10:20pm, however I did notice while leaving my house but it was not until a few minutes later at 10:20pm that it really caught my attention. It was a clear nights sky and some planes were visible very high up but there was nothing else flying close to the ground as the object did during that time. Due to the object being in such close proximity I was too awe struck to take a photo or video, as I absolutely should have and wish I had. I did not want to do anything that could have jepordized my safety.<n> <n><n> <n><n> personal note: I am willing to speak over the phone about the encounter but I do not wish to disclose any personal information. I wish to be anonymous and I do not seek to gain any attention or endure criticism. I simply want to share the experience in hopes that someone else saw the object as well or assistance in understanding the object and its origins.<n>

It was not real clear but it appeared to have a cigar shape going across the middle.  The object appeared in the sky, almost as if it had risen and then they each followed the same path across and upward in the sky until we could no longer see them.  They traveled at a speed similar to a plane.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We first saw 4 of them almost together and the last 2 came singularly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My husband is a retired pilot and has a good background as far as the sky and he did not recognize them as anything he had seen in the last 60 years.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The night was cloudy but while we were watching for another a falling star was seen even though we could see no other stars.<n>

The lights were brighter than the surrounding stars and did not look like any craft I have ever seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The lights appeared to be moving at slightly different speeds and after a short time 4 of the lights faded and disappeared.   2 of the lights remained and 1 stayed stationary while the other appeared to move from north to south.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After about 5 minutes the remaining lights slowly faded and disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The sky was mostly clear at the time of the sighting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was an aircraft in a different area of the sky and was not similar to the orange lights.<n>

We were facing East on Doe Ct in Brandon, FL.  The Amber lights were bigger than a star maybe double the size.  I am unsure of the height but they appeared to be flying high enough for a plane. There were 7 in total.  6 of the lights were on the right and were lined up and the 7th was on the left moving to the right towards the 6th other lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The 6 lights appeared to move into a triangular shape and up and down.  I do not remember the exact times that they made the shapes but they appeared to form a triangle and a diamond like shape.  The movements were purposeful and deliberate.  The lights then disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I called a friend and went into my home and came back out and realized the 7 lights were back again.  This time they were closer together.  They appeared to be moving up and down.   The time was 9:15 PM.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A neighbor was putting things in their car and I asked him if he knew what the lights were.  He looked at the lights and was very unsure of what they were and asked a few other neighbors to come out to witness them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> All together 5 of my neighbors stood looking at the lights baffled.  After about a few minutes the lights disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke via telephone with this witness, and she seemed to us to a quite capable and reliable witness.

I stepped outside to whitmess a round fireball moving slowly across the sky.  The object was moving north to south and was a orange and red ball and it appeared to have flames trailing behind.  It moved at in lateral direction and made no sound. It did not appear to be very high in the sky maybe 500 feet at the most.  We get a lot of planes and helicopters through here and it was nothing like that.  This was a slow moving ball. After about 20 seconds it turned east and then in about 3-4 seconds it was gone.<n>
3/2/13 21:00|Los Angeles|CA|Other|5 minutes|I saw a V shaped craft with no lights or sound flying through the night sky.|4/12/13|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/096/S96526.html|371|ndxe201303| I saw a V shaped craft with no lights or sound flying through the night sky<n> <n><n> <n><n> On the evening of March 1st 2013 around 9pm I was outside my residence looking up at the sky. You cant see too many stars normally in downtown LA, but you could see a little more than normal that night. I was looking at Orion and was surprised that you could see his sword. While gazing at that I noticed something odd moving in the sky across where I was looking. It appeared to be a V shaped craft similar to a flying wing like a B2 bomber. It had no lights at all and I couldn&#39;t pick up on any sound from it. It appeared to be a gray color, it blended almost seamlessly with the sky. There was a small prop plane in the sky as well in my vision of the sky, but it seemed to be civilian and at a much lower altitude. I turned to tell my roommate, couldn&#39;t get his attention, looked back, and I couldn&#39;t spot it again. I did some looking at drones online and the Lockheed Martin RQ-170 looks similar to what I saw, but the V wasn&#39;t as wide as the Lockheed Martin RQ-170 a! ppears to look. In any case, it was unsettling to witness and I wanted to report it for the greater good, especially if other reports have been made<n>

They were moving slowly west, silently, one slightly behind the other.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The trailing light broke off and made a tight, slow  U-turn and disappeared, while the other stayed, continuing to drift west for a good minute before fading from view.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Never seen anything like it, and its coloration was nothing like I&#39;ve seen on any aircraft (and they weren&#39;t on a commercial flight path).<n>

Both objests were at first headed north. Suddenly one of the objects began to climb in elevation it headed straight up (and I mean straight up) verry verry fast it was out of my eye sight in  a matter of moments. the other craft continued heading north also this craft was at first traveling slowley than it just sped up and accelerated verry verry vast and was out of sight in a matter of moments, how ever it did  ot head up into the sky like the other one it just continued heading north.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What compelled me to report this was the fact that these crafts did not move like a hellacopter or plane they were way faster, and hellacopters and planes dont just go straight up like that. Also they were jot illuminated like a hellacopter or air plane there were no flashing lights they were a solid red and orange color there no flashing lights at all just a solid ball object in the nights sky.  Also they did not make any noise they were silent and i believe they were low enough in altitude that I should have been able to hear some sort of sound comming from them.  The weather conditions were great it was a clear nite in colorado, my mother also whitnessed these lights in the sky. i&#39;ve seen lots of air craft in the sky as I live near an airport (about 1.5 miles away but in the opposite direction of where these lights were originally spotted) so I feel like i&#39;ve seen enough air craft in the nights sky to say with out a showdow of a doubs that these particullar air craft were j! ust DIFFERENT and verry out of the norm.  Air craft do not jenerally fly super close to each other, they make sound of some sort, and they are not usually light up in a solic color, normally they have flashing lights and that is clearly evident in the video footage that I have.  im not teck save so i need to sent this video to some body in the form of a text message video.  YOU NEED TO SEE THIS IT IS CAPTIVATING!!!!!<n>

These orbes were orene in color, flying real close to each other and just acting verry strage to be just some regular air craft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I live near an air port and have seen enough stuff in the sky. the air port is about 10 miles in the opposite direction of where these crafts were spotted. one of these cradts shot straight up in the sky at a rate of speed that I have never whitnesses before it was out of my visual view in a matter of 1 or 2 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The other craft stayed around a bit longer and continued heading north. This 2nd craft also took of faster than any thing i had ever seen. I could not hear any sound comming from ither of these crafts and they were a solid illuminated color. They were illuminated orange, there were no flashing lights they were lit up solid. I have video evidence of this sight! ing that I would like to share with any body who is interested in seeing this compelling video i just need to send it in the form of a video txt messege.<n>

I was headed north after picking up my son from daycare.  As I was coming to a stop light at the intersection I noticed out of my upper peripheral suddle movement.  Nothing side to side or eratic just moving forward at a speed like a plane would heading in the same direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I came to a complete stop the light was blocked by the roof of my car along with the stars.  My upper peripheral catches movement again as the light moves from out of the blockage of the roof and I look up.  At this point my eyes are locked onto this light, no more peripheral.  You can see movement out the side of your eye and it could be anything but when I locked eyes on the object I saw it was too high to make out a shape with no blinking lights of a plane but low enough to know it wasn&#39;t a star, and it was moving.  Any sound that the object might of had was block out by music.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After maybe 3 seconds of looking at the light I seen it cut real hard and fast at an angle away from earth.  The best way I can describe how it took off is Star Trek warp speed.  It went out in space and the only thing that was missing was the blink of light at the end.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

I noted the one dark orange light, almost red moving very slowly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first I did not notice it&#39;s motion until it was no longer lined up with the ground reference point I will sometimes make with objects not familiar or stars to see if they are in motion.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Where I am, I see a great deal of odd lights in the sky, flashes, etc to the point where they are &amp;quot;almost&amp;quot; a routine thing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Once I realized this object was in motion, it was on a trajectory to the NorthEast with a slight curve in the trajectory as it was moving almost due East initially.  It was moving too slow to be a satellite or a regular aircraft and no regular aircraft were in the area at the time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The 02:00 is an approximate time, within about 10 minutes either way.   If moonrise were earlier, than my time is wrong accordingly to moonrise (I initially did not think it significant until I tuned in Coast to Coast on 3-4-13<n> <n><n> <n><n> It took a while to traverse the portion of the sky where it was visible, about 4 minutes.  No sound was noted.  Speed, hard to estimate, but certainly below 500 knots as it moved notably slower than the typical passenger jet.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Object disappeared before reaching horizon.  The Moon was just below horizon, and minimal clouds were in the sky at the time.<n>

They did not behave like flares nor helicopters and weren&#39;t lanterns because I have seen all of these possible objects in the sky and what I saw was different.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They were of a fiery orange color and they would move from one side to the other but not as blown by the wind but more as an independent type of movement.<n> <n><n> <n><n> One of the lights went further away and descended from what appeared to be behind the mountain from my perspective. I cannot tell what exactly did it do since the mountain was in the way but it was clear it went down in altitude.  The other 2 remained for a while moving and hovering in turns.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was no sound that we could notice at any moment while we were witnessing this.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Since the moment I realized what I was seeing I called my mom to run upstairs and take a look which she did, so we both witnessed it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The only recording device I could get my hands on at that very moment was a tablet and when I tried to take video the lens was just not good enough to capture the lights at that distance although they were perfectly visible and obvious to the naked eye.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In 2 previous occasions, being the first time on December 23rd, 2013, (sic. 2012??) the second time must have been on February (2013?)  I got to witness the same orange lights but only 1 at a time.  Never more than one together until that night in March.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Since I witnessed the orange lights 3 times I&#39;ve become very intrigued by this and when I heard you&#39;re gathering reports about it I knew I had to tell what I saw for whatever is worth.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date in March 2013 is approximate.

I realized that the only time I ever see this is when there is a thick cloud cover, after noticing this the last time in March of 2013, I went into the house for only about 10 minutes (it was still going on) when I came out the sky had cleared up except for one cloud and in that cloud was a small version of what I saw still moving around, when I saw that, I figured to myself; it&#39;s time to write to the National UFO hotline and see if I&#39;m all alone on this thing or have others seen it?  No one I ask has ever seen anything like that or they give me a funny look.  I can say with all honesty, this is real but have no clue to what it is or wants. It was one large circular craft with five giant lights all circling independently and then coming into the center and then back out again! , all the time moving  clockwise.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

I alerted my mom, who pulled into the left turn lane and opened the window.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The light had a reddish halo when initially spotted, however it faded away into a single bright orange light.  It made no sound throughout the entire encounter.  It remained like this for about 15 seconds, then started to move ESE over a suburb.  It seemed to float, effortlessly for about 10 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We took the left turn and followed as close as we could on this road, and then it paused again.  We saw the reddish halo for about 3 seconds, then it concentrated into the orange light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After about 10 seconds, the light then seemed to change directions and move South.  This time it moved much quicker, and the movement seemed more forced.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It got smaller, and it was difficult to tell how far away it was at this point.  It then faded away and seemed to disappear into the clouds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We suspect an evening sighting, and have amended the time above, to reflect that fact.

The lights never grew further or closer apart from eachother and hovered slowly through the valley rotating end over end and staying the same distance away from eachother.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I went outside to see if I could hear hellicopter blades, but there was no noise.  The object or objects would move and rotate and for about 30 seconds it just stayed stationary.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We watched in awe as we discussed the possibilites of a UFO sighting, whatever we saw we all agreed it wasn&#39;t normal.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The Lights continued down the valley no faster than a hellicopter and no higher than the valley mountain tops untill one light went out of vision and then 20 seconds later the second one foll! owed.<n>

A yellow-orange light shining too brightly and decending against the darkening sky.  The other stars that were visisble at that moment had no comparision to what I was looking at. I immediately knew then that this wasn&#39;t normal.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I ran inside and yelled, &#34;There&#39;s fire in the sky!&#34; to my husband, who was eating dinner and he and our 8yr. old daughter both came out to the driveway to witness the phenomenon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My heart was beating fast as we stood there all three of us, pointing at the brightly lit object that was decending from the sky.  As it was moving, the light was diminishing and curved into a cloud far away and just  disappeared into the night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My husband tried to record it with his iphone video camera,only to realize it didn&#39;t record.  We were all in awe of what we had just seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am open to believe that this could&#39;ve been a meteror or falling star,but honestly this bight lighted object left no trail of fire behind and the movement of the object and how it disappeared was simply unreal.

It was a steady light about 6 ft high moving at about 15 miles per hour, the beach is full of rocks and I immediately dismissed the thought of a person running with a light or drving an atv - the ball of red light moved steadily from left to right at the same altitude right along the beach until I lost sight of it.

I just left the airport, I was on Richmond Airport Connector Rd. heading back to I-895 when I saw what I thought was airplane light to my right.  It was too early in the morning for a plane to be flying but I thought that maybe it was a plane returning to the airport after being serviced.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I continued to watch the plane I know that the object was not heading for the airport so I figured that it was a private jet servicing one of the companies in the area.  As I watched the object it stopped and a light was bright shining down.  So now I figured that the object must be police and they were looking for something.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I came up on the object, now on my right side, I noticed that it was an object that I had never seen.  It was hovering over the trees but there was no sound and the trees did not move.  The object was round as a cylinder; the inside was hallow except for two cylinders that went thru the middle.  Half way thru these two cylinders split and made a &#34;V&#34; shape.

It displayed some orange “cones” while in view. She sounded like a novice even though she sounded very credible and had observed another UFO about a year before. One thing, she needs to be specific about her siting location (near near Cottonwood Mall; or in So. Salt Lake; Avenues area; etc.). Also, she needs to estimate the size and movement characteristics of the UFO (only “east” and “west”, from her location just doesn&#39;t do it).<n> <n><n> <n><n> Would you please advise her to contact (soon) the Utah Chapter of MUFON through its state director (Max Mitchell, email is maximumtenn@gmail.com). The Utah Mufon is not a very active (my opinion) chapter even though Max has been given credit for the last few months as a 100 per-center in the CMS listing of the  MUFON UFO Journal.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Sincerely, Jim Fischer  P.S.  Am member of MUFON and have been to both Roswell and Bentwaters in recent years.<n>
