12/24/74 23:50|Tegucigalpa (Honduras)||Disk|15 seconds|I could have reached out and touch the UFO|12/2/00|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/014/S14501.html|1|ndxe197412| I could have reached out and touch the UFO<n> <n><n> <n><n> The saucer was about two feet in diameter. It flew about three feet in front of me. I was standing on a small balcony about five feet of the ground. The bottom part of the saucer was spinning. It had several lights all around. It had orange, red, and silver lights. At that time I thought it was a toy that I had never seen before. I remember running into my house and getting my dad to come out and see it because I wanted one. The Saucer did not make any noise whatsoever. It just flew by and dissapeared into the distance. The odd thing is that I know I was with three or four other kids. But I do not remember who they are, even though the incident is absolutely clear in my mind.<n>

I took my eyes off the star and resumed surveilance of a parking lot. A few minutes later I went back to the star only to find it high in the sky. I then observed it decend in a slight arch back to its original location. I called another officer to my location and he and I sat there and watched as the object got closer and actually came close enough so that we could see the pilot in the cockpit and the instrument lights reflecting off of his helment and visor.The craft had a huge light on the front (about 20 ft. in diameter) but, there was no light emitted from it. I would describe it as more (DIAMOND LIKE) and that is what we mistook for a bright twinkling star. The Pilot was deffinatly humanoid and when he observed us observing him, he put the craft in hyperspeed and left the area in an instant without any sound at all.  I was never allowed to submitt an official report on the incedent and a check of the locall airport indecated nothing on radar at that time.<n>

I was in highschool.  I was awakened around 3AM by a strange noise outside--A &#34;Whooo--whooo--whooo&#34; sound, fairly high-pitched.  There was a sliding glass door leading from my bedroom to the back yard.  I stepped outside.  It was a clear night and cold.  About 1/4 mile or so I saw a dics-shaped object in the sky, about 500 feet off the ground. It was hovering over a residential neighborhood, making that &#34;Whooo--whooo&#34; sound.  Suddenly, in the blink of an eye, the craft darted towards my house, as if it sensed my presense.  It scared the crap out of me.  It looked to be about 100 feet in diameter.  The craft was dark, with a band of glowing orange light around the middle.  Since it hovered over my house I got a very good look at the underside.  There were 3 half-domes of glowing bright blue light.  I gaped at the craft with a mixture of terror and awe.  The next thing I remember, I was waking in my bed the next morning.  To this day, I don&#39;t know if it was real or a dream but I have never been able to shake the image of that craft hovering over my house.  I have never had a dream that felt as real as this experience felt.  But since I was the only witness, I will never know for sure.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date may be approximate, although the witness does not indicate that fact in the date box above.

It was winter I was heavily dressed for the cold.  I had shot a 3 point buck and drug it up the ravine to get it back to the cabin.  Suddenly, a man in a white short sleeve shirt and black pants appeared from no where and stated, &#34;I see you got one&#34;.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I stated &#34;yeh&#34; wondering where the hell he came from and why he had no coat.  There were no other cabins for miles.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I stated, &#34;I have to drag this buck to the cabin&#34; and started dragging.  When I turned to look back he was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have never figured out what that was all about.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date is approximate.  PD))<n>

After sitting on our sleds for about 15 to 20 mins we saw an dark cigar shape (almost saucer shaped) with lights on each end and towards the middle pass over the lights of town, moving over the trees and a mobile home then stopping to hover over the road we had arrived on.  The craft hovered or maybe turned like a tank turrent does, and then raced off following the road and disappeared over the airport, making no noise at the time.  The airport was closed down at the time. I could tell this because the runway lights are turned on by the Flight Service STation in Houlton when needed by radio.  This craft was also seen from our home neighborhood by my friends mother looking out her homes back door which faces the ridge, at about the right time.  My father was an Navigation Aid electronic tech stationed at Presque from 1960 to 1976 and I grew up on and around the airport and am now a lic. pilot.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.
