It was like watching two lazer lights dance in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We wonder if the witness is, in fact, describing two laser lights.

We spoke with three witnesses to the event, and they all agree on the basic details surrounding the incident.  Approximately a dozen witnesses were looking at the sky to the south, when they all observed small, apparently distant objects streaking generally downward in the vicinity of the Sun.  They may have been self-luminous, but it was difficult for the witnesses to be certain of that.  The phenomenon is reported to have continued unabated for more than 20 minutes, during which the witnesses observed not fewer, they estimate, than 100-150 of the small objects.  PD))<n>

11/29/00 03:46|Sherwood|OR|Triangle|2 or 3 mins.|Saw very low flying, quite or HUGE object with 5 big bright lights in a V shape, evenly spaced. No strobe nor colored flashing lights.|12/2/00|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/015/S15130.html|7|ndxe200011| Saw very low flying, quite or HUGE object with 5 big bright lights in a V shape, evenly spaced. No strobe nor colored flashing lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was on my way to work at 3:46am, when I stopped at a stop sign in new housing development area in Sherwood on the outskirts of Portland. When I looked out my windshield I noticed a low flying formation of big bright white lights moving together as one low slow moving object. There were 5 lights shaped in a V. One on the tip of the object and two on either side of the craft and two more on the end of the V shaped craft. All were evenly spaced.  At first sight...I thought oh my! That&#39;s one low flying craft...but why aren&#39;t there any colored or blinking strobe lights flashing? 2 years ago before moving to Oregon, I lived for 6 years behind an Airport in Juneau Alaska...the runway was behind a stand of trees behind my home. So I have seen and heard many types of aircraft including the largest military cargo plane made (it flew in and stopped at the Army Air National Guard Station next to the Heliport and Airport. It&#39;s wing structure wouldn&#39;t allow for a V configuration of lights like I saw, and neither would anything but a triangular shaped craft or a chevron shape).  And, I also saw a Harrier Jet rising up from the runway, flying stationary and then zooming up and away during a &#34;Snowbird&#34; airshow directly behind my home (watched it through my livingroom bay windows). It was soooooo LOUD!!! And all the planes I have ever seen have some sort of colored flashing beacon lights of some sort. So, what struck me as verrrrrry unusual was the absence of these kinds of lights, and I couldn&#39;t hear any sound. I then thought that what ever this is it has to be very high up to be so quite and moving slowly and if so...then this thing is SOOOO HUGE, and the 5 white lights very big and bright to shine so much. Or it&#39;s a low flying craft which is very strange....that it&#39;s so quiet. Very quiet. (no engine sounds) But what ever it was...it was still a large flying object. I watched it for a few minutes as it slowly passed almost over head and then I made my right hand turn and pulled over to the right hand side of ther road and turned my head around and looked at it through the drivers side window when I noticed it start to bank left (the V formation of 5 lights turned into 3, because it was turning) and fly off towards a more unpopulated area. I then took off because I didn&#39;t want to be late for work. I thought it might be a stealth wing, but when I saw the photos of the lights on them, I saw that they had a red light under the belly of the plane and small green lights (landing gear lights?) and more white lights than what I saw and the pattern of white lights were not evenly spaced along the V shape on the Stealth craft. Now I&#39;m even more puzzled because what I saw didn&#39;t have a red light underneath nor could I see an afterburner in the back like the stealth aircraft. Unless it&#39;s the space shuttle? But I don&#39;t think so...even that has an afterburner! UFO...that&#39;s all I know as of right now.<n>

It rapidly came closer and I could see that it was round with many thin pieces sticking out of the object.  Twice it stopped and changed directions, and then continued on the orginal path.  When it was almost directly overhead, it began to change into an orange color and then back to the white.  When it changed color it did so gradually, and started in the center, and then worked it&#39;s way to the thin pieces that were attached to the circle. The thin pieces then began to flash orange and white.  Even though it was very close, it was silent.<n>

But since they were far off and difficult to hold the camera still on the zoom it was hard to get a more precise description.  My guess is falling satillite that broke up into three pieces but I would like to know what it was.<n>

It almost looked like it was going to graze the tops of the buildings. Then it to condensed into one light and disappeared. They were against the orange glow of the city lights and were very easy to see.

I hope that somebody else saw this object and will come forward and report it,so I will know I am not the only one.<n>

At its brightest the light was much brighter than the background stars, and of similar intensity to a bright shooting star.it was a dark moonless night with many shooting stars, but they dont move in eliptical paths !. Also around the same time another object was seen to track south east ward from a position abeam left, to infront overhead, to right side horizon. its path was only visible as it pulsed light, one short quick pulse, one slightly longer one. this occurred 3 times (that I saw) each pair of pulses showed the objects track to be consistent with the last.Its, aprox. track was southeast.i believe what i observed is consistent with a test of a space based weapons system. I have never seen anything unusual in 20 yrs of professional aviation, and 10 yrs on the N. Atlantic.<n>

A low star...lowest in the sky.  Sitting NW of our city of Iron River.  It was blue, green and red.  With the human eye, the object shifted erratically to the left and to the right.  Than making loops and oval circles in the sky.  We were horrified.  My cousine got his video camera and while holding it so very steady, this object was dancing across the sky, left right, in out and the most bizzarre was that it would change shapes from a cigar to wheel to diamond to circular...and we have it on tape.  The object in focus, whether through binoculars or video camera was almost like looking at special effects.  Glowing, than blurring, than into a sphere that shot rays of green, blue and yellow light.  Jupiter....?  I think not.  This object was being manuvered and here is the kicker...it dissappeared out of the sky after five hours.  How can a planet do that?  How can a planet do &#34;U&#34; shaped flying in the sky?

The object was about three hundred feet above treetop level moving west to east or from my right to my left.I just happened to glance up just as the object came over the trees and watched it for about 15 or 20 seconds until it disappeared over the trees to my left. As soon as I glanced up at it ,2 lights flashed twice and just before it went out of sight an entire bank of lights flashed all the way around the object.The object made no sound at all. It was really eriee to see something so large and so silent.As far as the size of the object,the best guess I can make is about the size of an average house. If I had to make a guess, I would say aprox. 150 to 200 feet long and 75 to 100 feet wide.<n>

Then 10 minutes later Art Bells websight announced there were ten sightings of a UFO over Camarillo,California.Thats just what I saw!! So I told my story and sent it to Art Bells web site.Please send me other reports if any,this is my first real sighting that was confirmed...Thank you ((name deleted))<n>

The sky was clear in the observation window, with some scattered clouds to the North.  Wind was out of the NW at 12 mph.  Temperature was 52 degrees F.  Visibility 9 miles.  Movement of sphere was fast, estimate of alitude was around 12,000 ft. +, then it slowed as it came over Broken Arrow, Oklahoma, began a snake-like movement, appeared to nearly stop at times. Object then turned toward the Southwest, began a 45 degree ascent, disappeared from sight due to gaining alitude.  Sphere did not appear to be self luminous, but reflected sunlight. I first thought it may be a high altitude balloon, but the movement was too fast and due to its turn to Southwest and ascent to higher altitude. Commercial and military aircraft activity was in the area at different times during this sighting, since the area is close to the Tulsa International Airport.  I am very familiar with commercial and military aircraft, research balloons, sundogs and other unusual atmospheric phenomena.  Both my wife and I observed the object.  I was involved for 30 years in the investigation of the UFO phenomenon and was an associate to Dr. J. Allen Hynek.  I do not know what the object was, therefore it remains a UFO.<n>

As he walked to where his stand was located and climbed up in it, he was looking over this field where there had been deer traces the day before he noticed a round bright light in the distance (he was facing southwest mind you) which seemed to be dancing or bouncing.  It caught his attention for several minutes, but being a confirmed skeptic, he laughingly thought of what it could possibly be.  Suddenly he was distracted by a rustling in the bushes nearest to him from the field.  He soon found out that the rustling was just birds getting up.  So he tried to to watch the sphere again, but it had moved more to south.  But when had finally found it again, it was standing still.  This is highly unlkely to be a shooting star; or other easily explained scientific possibilities.  Then suddenly it shot straight &#34;up&#34; not down.  My father still believes it scientifically eplainable, but how bout you?<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

READ!!!<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We presume this report comes from a serious-minded witness, but we have no other reports of the event.  PD))<n> <n><n> <n><n> Friday night was cool, rainy, and a little hazy, so myself and three other people were hanging out at one of the their  house in rural Georgia.  Around 12 midnight, the power went out, so we just lit some candles and chilled out.  Around 2:30 am two of the people went out on to the front porch to smoke, while myself and the other person stayed inside.  About 3 am, the power came on then flickered and went out again.  Immediately following this we heard the two on the porch scream:  &#34;Oh my God!  Ya&#39;ll get out here!&#34;  Myself and my companion just ignored them and then a few seconds later we heard:  &#34;Oh my God! Get out here now!  You have got to see this!!&#34;  So myself and my companion ran out on to the front porch and our friends told us that they had just witnessed to flashes of light that covered the ENTIRE sky.  Myself and my companion didn&#39;t know what to make of what our two friends had told us. My companion went into the house while I stayed out on the front porch with the two others.  About 20 minutes later, the electricity came back on, flickered, and went out, then i saw the most amazing and unexplainable thing i have ever seen.  The ENTIRE sky, from as far as we could see to the left to as far as we could see to the right, from the horizon to as far as we could see up, was lit up in the brightest white-ish yellow flash i have ever seen.   I jumped out of my seat and began to scream for my companion in the house.  About this time a second brilliant flash occurred, this one too, encompassing the ENTIRE sky.  However, this flash was a brilliant flourescent dark green and, too, covered everything.  But this flash had a darker, almost black, center in the middle of the sky that didn&#39;t have any distinguishing boundaries but just flowed and blended with the dark green glow that was everywhere, but no sound whatsoever followed the flashes.  Now, we were just stunned and screaming for our companion.  She finally came out and we tried to explain what had happened.  So we all waited on the front porch again and about 20 minutes later the same sequence of events happened again.  The power came on, then flickered, went off, then the bright flash followed by the dark green flash.  Now we had all seen it and were stunned and going hysterical.  The bright light was like the kind you see when a nuclear bomb goes off, and the green glow was something never before seen by any of us.  So we all ran out to the highway that is maybe 30 yards in front of the house so we could get a better view. Across the road are hills with a some trees on the tops and backsides of the hills, while fields make up the front sides of the hills that were visible to us.  There is probably 100 to 150 yards worth of visibility to the top of the hills, then it goes to the backside.  When we reached the road we were just waiting to see it again when we noticed something over the hills.  We could see about 4 or 5 beams of light moving around like people walking with flashlights or spotlights on the backside of the hills moing towards the top of the hills.  We knew noone should be over there with lights, especially at 3:45 in the morning.  Then, all of a sudden, we saw a beam of light come out of nowhere from the middle of the field about 50 to 75 yards away, like someone had all of a sudden flipped on a flashlight.  When we saw this, we quickly ran back to the porch.  When we got back to the porch 15 seconds later, we could not see one light anywhere from the fields or anywhere over the hills.  About this time, the power flipped on again, flickered, went out, and then the two flashes came again.  So we ran back out to the road to get a better look and waited.  About 15 minutes later we looked right up the road about 50 yards and noticed a car that was just sitting on the side of the road next to a vacant lot.  Then the pattern repeated itself:  power on, flickering, going out, then the first flash.  When the first flash went off, the car all of a sudden flipped its lights on and began speeding towards us.  We began to get into the road and wave him down.  Initially it appeared he wouldn&#39;t stop, but he slammed on his breaks and stopped just as the second dark green flash was going off.   When he stopped, everything was green from the glow, even the inside of this car. We ran up and asked:  &#34;Are you seeing these lights???!!!   What do think is going on???&#34; The guy initially looked at us like he didn&#39;t know what we were talking about, despite the fact everything was green, but then he answered in an extremely weird, non-chalant kind of way:  &#34;Oh, that&#39;s just the beacon.  Its there so planes won&#39;t crash.  Its usually white lights but sometimes it can change to different colors.&#34;  Then he said:  &#34;The regular paper guy won a contest.  I&#39;m the district manager just filling in for him.  Do you get a paper?&#34;  then he handed us a paper and drove off. We watched him go on, and instead of delivering more papers down the road where there are many more houses, he turned into the next driveway turned around and sped off in the direction which he had just come, without delievering any more papers!  Granted, the flashes alone freaked us out, but the paper guy and the beams of light just added to our confusion.  First of all, there are absolutely NO BEACONS anywhere in that area of rural Carrollton, i am positive of that.  Right as the guy sped off, our power came on and stayed on the rest of the night, with us seeing no more flashes, leaving us with having seen 5 two flash sets in total in 1.5 hours. We spent the rest of the night trying to figure out what happened.  We definitely ruled out swamp gas, beacons, and power transformers blowing.  The only explanations we were left with were other worldly or, more possibly, some type of government test and coverup.  The guys with the beams of light and the convenient paper guy with a cover-up story just as the event ended just added to our belief in gov&#39;t involvement.  The next day i was relaying the events to my mother, and she was having a hard time fully believing me.  Then a few minutes later she came in and showed my something she just read in the Saturday paper.  It was an aritcle in the Atlanta Journal and Constitution that read:  &#34;Solar Storms could disrupt power in U.S. :   Earth is likely to be bombarded with an unusual rapid-fire blast from five solar storms that could disrupt power grids, communications and airplane navigation in the northern United States today and Sunday, space weather forecasters warned Friday.  But they said the same machine-gunlike geomagnetic blasts also could pull spectacular Northern Lights sky show farther south, where more people will be able to see the colored lights dance in the northern sky.  There&#39;s an 80 percent chance that the storms will cause minor to severe disruptions to satellite communications, radio and television transmissions, and electric power grids, warned the Space Environment Center in  Washington, a division of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.  The &#34;storms&#34; are stron surges of solar winds - electrically charged subatomic particles from the sun - that make changes in the Earth&#39;s magnetic field, much like charging a small magnet with an electrical current.  There&#39;s a 40 percent chance the storms will cause major or severe disruptions and a 40 percent chance their efforts will be minor.&#34; I have to say that those that winessed this are not crazy Georgia rednecks, we are all college graduates with well respected jobs who did not make up the event that we can&#39;t explain.  However, we do know this article is b.s.  For one, why did this article appear the day AFTER it happened.  If they knew friday it was going to happen, why didn&#39;t they tell us on friday so we could be prepared instead of telling us on Saturday.  Secondly,  this article provides an excuse for almost every aspect of our experience.  However, these excuses also seem to be b.s. and a little to convenient.   I&#39;ve seen the Northern Lights and what we saw definitely in no way shape or form resembled the Norther Lights.  These were blasts of light.  One bright white, one a dark green glow.  We are all still voting for a Gov&#39;t coverup...the people in the fields, the guy in the car, and the article from Washington...it just all points to the government covering something up, but what they are covering up is the question. Any, and i mean any, insight into this situation would be greatly appreciated, as no one we have talked with can offer a feasible solution.  I must reiterate that this is IN NO WAY A FALSE REPORT.  This truely and definitely happened on the moring of Saturday November 25, 2000 from 3:00 am till about 4:30 am.  Someone please respond.  I do not want to initially release too much info about myself as i am in a sensitive line of work.<n>

(UFO&#39;s)...<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was going home to NY from my girlfriend&#39;s house. As I was driving on the NJ Turnpike North approaching the exit for Elizabeth township, I saw this huge blue light approaching at a very fast speed illuminating the highway. When I slowed down to look at it, it just flew very low to the ground without making any sound. It was flying right next to the highway light poles. Again, no sound. It then slowed down, hovering in the air and then it took off at a very high speed rate. The whole thing was brightly illuminated by a blue light. I am pretty sure that the Newark airport airplane controllers must have seen it on their radar. If this helps you in any way, thanks very much for reading my article.<n>

Then a small plane comes in from the northeast and the light goes out and the show is over.It had just got dark and the sky still had the blue look to it. The only reason I saw saw this was because the city lights reflected off them making them visible against the dark blue sky behind them.If these are ours... I did not see anything O.K.?<n>

This was viewed on a beautifully clear night, which was the only reason I was looking at the sky.  The disk appeared from nowhere and was searing white and moved incredibly fast toward the horizon approximately 10 miles away from my view point at which point it began to slow it&#39;s acceleration and then dissapeared behind the horizon.  I would like to state for the record of credibility that I am an avid sky watcher, have taken a course in Astronomy, which was self-study, and live in the O&#39;hare airport area, so I have extensive knowledge in the arena of sky watching with numerous jetliners and personal bi-planes and lear jets in sight as well. Although it did not display any physics-defying manuevers it was extremely fast, much faster than any other flying craft that I have ever seen. This was a brief encounter, but I must say that it was unmistakable for any other craft and was simply too large for any asteroid and there were no known comets for the night so my conclusion would be that it was an unidentified flying object.<n>

The first sighted objects (2) were followed by a formation of about 8 to 12, then a pause and then a new formation, this repeated several times.  The object were moving against the wind in the upper atmosphere above the cloud covering which was coming over the Atlanta area at that time.  The fading away of the object could have been due to the clouds.  It is not possible to define if the brightness of the objects was due to their own light or if it was reflection from the sun.  The objects were disks shaped as seen with low powered binoculars.  No noise but this may have been due to the distance. I am a scientist with a Ph.D. in biochemistry.<n>

It was hard to tell how high it was because of our angle of viewing.If it was 1000Ft. it was larger than a house if higher then it was massive.It moved off to the east as we stood there amazed....(We looked at eachother and said noone will ever believe us!) By the way neither of us were under the influence of any drugs or alcohol.we were stone cold sober.It made NO noise at all as it was passing,we believe the bright light was  from this thing because it came from the sky right before it appeared.I am a professional audio engineer and my cousin works at a hospital. this is no hoax.No exaggeration either.<n>

The light would turn off, then on...zip to the right and back to its original place...then go left. IT seemed to be &#34;communicating&#34; with two other like objects. The communication was the bright one flashing its light as the other two. Then the two speed off from visibility. About 10 minutes into this two helicopters flew over the object, it turned sidways and we saw what looked like a bar of blue light on its sight and without warning the object burnt out. No trace of it... and the fact that there is not a tower, antenna or light source which could produce this light. It has only shown up over this week and does not move like a traditional aircraft would have to to not crash. This object and its two companions hover, sitting silently and still in the sky. The Bell County area is full of activity...a personal belief is that it has something to do with the fact that Fort Hood is located here. Near my grandmothers house, which is close to hwy 190, my family and strangers have observed MANY &#34;floating balls of light&#34; which seem to gather around a large microwave tower, maybe they are refueling?<n>
11/23/00 18:37|El Paso and Alamogordo (Between )|NM|Cigar|3 minutes|A dark cigar-shaped object with no lights that was at least 100 meters wide.|12/2/00|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/015/S15021.html|49|ndxe200011| A dark cigar-shaped object with no lights that was at least 100 meters wide.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was driving from between Alamogordo, NM and El Paso, TX tonight and noticed a large dark object to the east of US highway 54.  At first, I thought the object was a military blimp without any lights on it.  The night was very clear with only a couple of clouds very far to the west over the Organ Mts (Near Las Cruces, NM).  There was no moonlight.  As I drove, I thought the dark object was far to big to be one of the Ft. Bliss military or border patrol blimps.  I pulled over to look at the thing and it was gone. I know it sounds crazy but I&#39;m positive the thing was there.  There were no strange reflections on my windshield or anything like that.  I took a few photos of the area but didn&#39;t get to take any of the object.  The sighting of whatever this thing was between mile markers 23 and 24 on US highway 54 in New Mexico (in Dona Ana County). The object was atleast 100m long and vaguely cigar shaped.  I could not tell anything about how deep it was.  There was no lights on the object and it was dark.  It was NOT a cloud.<n>
11/23/00 18:20|Fountain City|WI|Light|45minutes|Red Light changing colors and "dancing" above Wisconsin Valley Bluffs|12/9/00|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/015/S15382.html|50|ndxe200011| Red Light changing colors and &#34;dancing&#34; above Wisconsin Valley Bluffs<n> <n><n> <n><n> At 6:20pm on Thanksgiving night, my brother and I went out on our parents&#39; deck for some fresh air, since my dad was burning wood in our wood stove, and the fumes were bothersome.....As we went out on the deck, we both noticed how very clear the sky was, and how we could both make out the &#34;milky way&#34;.  As I turned to the north, which would be to my left,(Pleiades star cluster directly behind me), I spotted a &#34;stationary&#34; red &#34;orb&#34;.  My brother went to get his binoculars and I sat and watched it till he returned.  It was &#34;hovering&#34; and or &#34;bouncing like a leaf on the wind&#34; approximately 100 feet above a &#34;ridge of bluffs&#34; called &#34;Canada Ridge&#34;, in a Valley known as &#34;Eagle Valley&#34;......located about 11 miles from Fountain City, Wisconsin.  You could see the light move, first from the left to the right, then right to left......it then shot upwards a few feet and then returned down to its&#39; orignal spot. The color was orignally &#34;red&#34;, but changed without blinking from orange to white to green and then back to red....eventually the light moved down into the tree-line where it proceeded to move back and forth for awhile and then returned upwards to its&#39; orignal spot for a few moments and then dropped into the next valley out of sight.  The whole event lasted perhaps 45 minutes.  The temperature that night was 30 degrees with no wind.  During the event, there was absolutely no sound, and the light was located from us only about 1/2 mile away.....the size of the light at arms length would be the size of a &#34;pencil eraser&#34;.<n>

As my husband was unlocking the car I was gazing up to the sky and commented on how clear it was that night. Just as I said that I noticed a faint light crossing the sky. I continued to look and I noticed that there were a series of faint lights (6 or 7) in a V shape. I called to my family to look up to the sky and they all saw it as well.  We watched as it silently crossed the sky.  After we got into the car and my husband started pulling away, I continued looking up and all of a sudden saw the same type of faint lights (this time maybe 8 - 10 &#34;lights&#34;) in an arc or crescent shape.  Only myself and my oldest daughter saw the second one since we were in the car and my husband was driving, by the time he tried to look up and see anything it was out of sight already.  Even though the &#34;lights&#34; were faint, the &#34;object&#34; appeared relatively close compared to planes that you see in the sky. There was no sound either time, and there was a hint of a &#34;shadow&#34; where the body of this thing would be. The dull lights were orangy/pinkish on both of the sightings and were steady, not blinking/flashing - heading in a southerly direction.<n>

I looked through the sheer drapes that were closed at the time, and noticed quite a few lights directly east moving northbound. When I parted the drapes I had expected either helicopters or planes, but was stunned by the enormity of the &#34;one&#34; triangular object that I saw. The object itself was bigger than a football field, had one red light in the bottom middle with smaller white lights in each of the corners, was charcoal grey to black colored, and surrounded by a dull orangy faint glow of some sort. It moved what I consider to be slower than stall speed for an aircraft in a slightly northeastern direction. The height at which it was flying was in my opinion just high enough to clear a radio tower, of which there are several in the direction it was headed. The hum sound it emitted was neither a prop, or jet engine as I am familiar with both of these. I am a 38 year old music teacher, and have programmed sounds on synthesizers regularly, and relate it to a low modulating frequency with a slow sweeping resonance effect. I used up a little time trying to look for a camera, and decided to give up the search for one, and step outside to get a better look.  By the time I was outdoors it took about 20 seconds to disappear over the northeastern neighborhood rooftops. The conditions that morning were overcast, and still dark out at 6:30 a.m., and being right next to an interstate feel that surely someone else might have experienced the same event that morning.<n>

I looked up at it when it first came into view and watched it move very rapidly to the southeast until it winked out 4 seconds later in the sky above a 30&#39; high house.  The light looked bright white, round, golf ball size when it was above me, but became a flattened horizontal band of 5 lights as it moved rapidly away from me, with a larger center bright light and other white lights with a hint of pale yellow to the sides of it.  The lights maintained a constant altitude moving NW to SE (corrected 19.5 deviation compass reading S 135 E).  The lights could have been 100-200&#39; above me, judging from the height of the house above which it vanished.  ((Illustration in text of report.))  Two seconds after it winked out, I sasw the red &amp; white lights of a jet appear to the east of where the lights vnaished, as the jet was in the process of majing its turn to a south heading into SeaTac.

We were traveling South from Ames Avenue on 60th Street when we noticed a set of lights proceeding North / North - West, fairly low in the sky. At first, we didn&#39;t think anything of this, as we live near a major airport, and this would not be an unusual approach for an aircraft heading for a landing. As it got close, however, my daughter said that it seemed odd that there were no strobe or red / green lights typically seen on planes that go by. All this one had was a series of white lights, of equal amplitude, that seemed to be spaced out all along and around the edges of the object. Even though she had a migraine, this was so strange that she asked me to turn off the road we were on and West, just so we might catch a better look at the object as it passed overhead. We did this, quickly, and were almost directly underneath the object as it moved on its North / North-West path. There were no airplane engine sounds, and more important, we could not see any fuselage. The object was triangular in shape, and there were lights along the edges and at the corners. We watched as it moved out of sight...never making the &#39;turn&#39; to the East that one would normally expect an airplane heading for Omaha&#39;s airport to make. We then went on to the Hospital.<n>

No strobes or flashes.  I contacted air traffic control - no radar for that part of the town at that low altitude.  Military? How do I connect with readers who may have seen a UFO I (along with 12 others) sited in Yosemite in October of 1982?  It was a blue saucer that cruised in and hoovered on the south side (unfamous side) of Half Dome for an hour then flew off as the same way it cruised in - zig zags and bursts of speed instantaneously.<n>

I zoomed in (320x digital zoom) a few times and what I saw(and recorded) was a yellowish nucleous with some sort of colored energy bands or radiation coming from it,on both the left and right sides there is something shaped half circular and is pitch black and has no color yet the radiant color spills all around the orb except in these spots.I have the tape and I don`t know the first thing about what to do with it.Anyway, get back at me people,I`m flippin my lid trying rationalize this.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Report is reminiscent of twinkling star, or Jupiter, which is in that area of the sky at present.

The time was just after 8:30 AM (the half hour news was playing on the radio). The sky was clear with very light and very high cirrus cloud cover in the southeast direction. I looked out my window and noticed a very distinct, silvery object that I initially thought was an airplane. It had a cylindrical or cigar shaped body. Although the object was distinct, I couldn&#39;t detect any wing or tail features in the brief glances I made while trying to keep my eyes on the road and traffic. The object looked like it was at least 1000 feet or so above Boundary Bay (SSW of my position at about 40 degrees above the horizon. It was much larger/closer than my August 3rd sighting (about half the diameter of a dime held at arms length). It was aligned in approximately a north/south alignment and seemed to be hovering or moving very slowly. There was absolutely no vapor trail. I kept glancing back at it trying to get a better view. On my third or fourth glance, it suddenly disappeared completely. One moment it was there, the next it had vanished completely. I tried scanning the sky repeatedly and could see nothing but blue sky. Then just as suddenly, it was there again, in about the same part of the sky I had seen it, less than a minute before. Again I got two or three glances at it and just as suddenly as before, it completely vanished. At this point I pulled my vehicle to the shoulder and stopped my truck. I scanned the whole sky and could find no aircraft. I kept waiting and scanning for  a few minutes but  no object reappeared in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Our gratitude to the UFO*BC group in Vancouver, B.C., for submitting this report.

I looked up and saw a very large triangle shape that was lit up by hundreds of small lights around the outside of the craft. I looked around to see if anybody else was witnessing what I was seeing but there was nobody around me except for the people in their cars on the street. The triangle formation was too tight to be a formation of planes, at no point did the lights move from oneanother or separate from their formation. I saw a smaller cluster of lights on the bottom of the craft and in the middle of the triangle. The cluster of lights began to flash and spin around in circles. At that time I saw a brighter light shining out from the smaller cluster of lights that were flashing. A beam of light very similar in size to a spot light began to shin down towards the ground. It was very unusual but the beam of light did not touch the ground, it stopped about 20 or 30 feet above the ground. I could not figure out why the light was not touching the ground but you could see where exactly the beam stopped. then after about a minute of watching this,it (the ufo) tilted upward and took off straight up into the sky from a dead stop where I saw it. Within less that a second the triangle was gone. As it took off there was a very faint streak of what looked like flames coming from the back of the ufo. This was not seen by anybody else that I asked on the street and I placed a call to the police and asked if they had recieved any calls about it but they said that they did not. I hope that this story helps to figure out what kind of visitors we are having in our atmosphere. Thanks,  Name withheld<n>

I continued watching it and it started moving toward me I thought I was seeing things so I closed my eyes for a few seconds, when I opened them I couldn&#39;t believe what I was seeing it was a triangular shaped flying device with a very bright light that was sending sparks of light through it, it freaked me out so I ran into the house.

I noticed a bright object to the North East traveling in a South West direction that was a very bright white light.  I would estimate the object had to be at an altitude of 8,000 to 10,000 feet and 2 to 3 miles from my viewpoint.   I assumed it was an airplane but the object was going pretty fast, faster than an airpane.  At this point I thought it might be a shooting star but the object had a pulsating bright white light not leaving a trail behind it. The object suddenly stopped for a few seconds then the glowing became very dim and dropped at a slight angle to the ground.  It went out of sight behind the hills and trees for a few seconds then it moved back up to the position it dropped altitude from, began to glow bright again then took off in a climbing direction in the South East direction at a faster speed than before.  It went out of sight in about five seconds. I also noticed two aircraft in the sky at this time.  I know that these pilots had to see this object. I have seen many shooting stars but have never seen one stop, fall to the ground, then return to the sky and take off again.  Got any ideas what I saw?<n>

The night was very clear and I first thought it was a very bright star, but it appeared to be blinking red, green and blue lights. Since it was blinking, I then thought it may be some type of aircraft, but it was not moving at all. I used a pair of binoculars to get a better look, but it was so far out over Lake Michigan that it only made the lights more defined. I was just curious if there were any other reports of it, or some explaination.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Report seems reminiscent of twinkling star, or planet.  PD))<n>

I stopped, turned around, and started looking southeast over the Gulf of Mexico. My wife turned around as well and looked in the same direction as I was looking. About 15 seconds later, we both saw a football shaped fireball that suddenly appeared about 10 degrees above the horizion heading straight downward. This firball was moving very slow, and we watched it for a good 6 seconds. Durning this time the fireball changed from a brilliant white color to a dual combination of burnt orange and green. The fireball was about dime size at arms length, and vanished an instant before making contact with the water. I estimate the range from us on the beach at no more than 3 miles. While walking the beach we noticed several meteors crossing the clear, nighttime sky, and this fireball resembled none of them. It was much, much bigger and brighter, and heading downward instead of crossing the sky.<n>

He describe them as triangles.  It was too dark to see how many they were.  He did say the triangles broke apart and became three.  A bright beam (greenish) in color was seen.  Two of the ufos left the one and just hovered.  One left going south. Thhe area where he saw them was in Phoenix, Arizona near freeway I-17 and 27th Ave.  near Bethnay home road, looking up in the sky.  He ran and got his mother (my daughter) to come look.  She noticed the two that seemed to hang in the sky.  Then another light joined the two and started to move toward their home.  She called me and I told them to get into the house. they probably knew they were watching.  They of course did.   I told them to pray they are demonic and you dont want to let them know you are curious.<n>

It then reappeared in the same shape, but was moving straight upwards.  It then disappeared again.  It reappeared one more time, but in a different shape.  It had six white lights in a hexagon shape(like a stop sign with 6 lights instead of 8).  It also had a red flashing light in the middle.  It was closer this time and was moving in the opposite direction that it was when I first saw it.  I could tell that it was below the clouds and it was making no noise at all.  The only thing i could see was the lights, no outline of a craft or anything.  It was moving away from us and I eventually lost it on the way back to my fiends house.  When we pulled in the driveway we saw an airplane moving very quickly in the direction that the UFO was headed.  We also saw two helicopters as well.<n>

I saw one when I was little, so I know theyr&#39;e out there.  I woke up at exactly 4:13 in the morning, crying.  I was in this room sort of like a warehouse.  I saw windows on the left side of it.  I can&#39;t remember actually seeing any beings, but they had my 18 year old son on a table tied to it.  There was another person on a table to the right of him.  They told me they were going to cut him up and eat him.  I found out after telling my daughter about the &#34;dream&#34; I had that my son had a weird experience too.  He had missing time of about an hour.  He said he was driving early in the morning to meet his Dad for a hunting trip, and he was at the top of a mountain the last he remembered.  He can&#39;t remember getting to the bottom.  Later that night his friends noticed three strange marks on his upper arm.  I&#39;ve been doing a lot of reading since and one of the books explains about the grays doing emotional testing.  I really think that&#39;s what happened to us.  I have the feeling that I&#39;ve been experiwenceing abductions since I was four years old, when I first saw the big white ball of light in the field across from my house.  I truly felt like my son was in danger.  I was trying to stop them from eating him, and protect him.  It&#39;s the only &#34;dream&#34; that I can remember that vividly.  Thanks for any input you can give me.<n>

I was in the house cooking the kids were in the backyard jumping on the trampoline while I fixed them some thing to eat in the kitchen, I could see them through the window because my backdoor light was on.  I saw them stop jumping and were staring up at the sky.  I was about to walk out and see what they were looking at because I live in a area that is surrounded by chemeical plants and casino lights so the sky is usually pretty lit up and I owe a telesscope and me and a good friend of mine had recently been seeing strange lights int the sky; but before I could walk outside the kids all came running in scared by strange lights they were seeing moving in the sky.  I quickly went out= side to see what they saw and sure enough above the treeline I saw a white glowing sphere of light that pulsed blue and amber lights.  It was dancing erradically in the sky.  You could clearly see it moving up and down, side- ways and it was as bright as a star in fact when it was still you could almost believe it was a star.  As we are out there looking at this my son(11)hollers;&#34;Look there are more of them  only smaller they are moving too!&#34;  I thought he might be caught up in the moment and was imaging it, but when I looked he was right.  The other objects looked like dimmly lit stars but were pulsing the same blue and amber lights, they were also moving erradically but almost like in accordance with the larger brightly lit object.  My husband and friend showed up and found me sin the backyard watching these crafts.  My husband who is a very skeptical was stunned by what we were seeing.  He could find a resaonalbe answer for the objects. The craft made no sounds at all and the larger one began to shot out sparks of light like a beam down towards the ground in the woods behind my house. At that moment we heard an aircraft approaching it was a big passenger plane coming from the airport from the front of my house it  passed extremly close to the brightly lit craft and the craft still continued its erradic dance in the sky.  We see aircraft alot around here and everyone who saw it knows it was a conventional craft.  The sightings of these objects is becoming more frequently in my area.  I decided to report this event only because of that fact.  I don&#39;t want to be ridiculed by people but since it is happening so frequently I felt compled to report it to someone who might be able to investigate.  If I had a camcorder I would be sending you footage.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Report is not inconsistent with the many report NUFORC receives of &#34;twinkling&#34; stars or planets.  They are virtually always reported to have multiple colors, and to jump around in the night sky.  PD))<n>
11/19/00 22:00|Arlington|VA|Disk|10 minutes|There were lights on the object that changed in a distinct circular pattern from red and white.|12/2/00|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/014/S14977.html|80|ndxe200011| There were lights on the object that changed in a distinct circular pattern from red and white.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Last night at approx. 10:00p.m. eastern time I observed an object flying southeast overhead accross a flight path to National Airport only a few miles out side of the District of Columbia.  What caught my eye was Military Road in Arlington has constant aircraft heading toward the Potomac River preparing for landings at Reagan National Airport.  The aircraft fly so low you are very accustomed to their sounds, different lighting, and even at times are able to read the company logos on the side of the aircraft.  Last night I was taking down draperies and as I looked up I saw blinking white then red then white again lights that were unfamiliar to any normal aircraft that we have seen.  These lights formed a somewhat circular pattern and would alternate between the red and white in this clear pattern.  This first caught my eye and as I observed if further it seemed to move in a pattern of front and back and then side to side but all the while moving forward, almost as if it was gliding or floating.  I pointed this unusual sighting to my  daughter and her friend (both honor students at G.W. University) where I work.  We then proceeded outside to the front yard and watched as this light pattern and movement continued.  As it moved closer and continued over the house, it was not close enough to determine the exact shape but as we closely watched the light pattern it seemed as though it was somewhat circular (most definitely not our usual jet or helicopter) and continued with very exacting movement and light pattern.  And then very suddenly we saw another one meet with it and they both seemed to instantaneously disappear.  Just a further note, I have never seen anything like this,  I am very well traveled and come from a military background.  This was most defiinitely some time of aircraft and what perplexes me is how something like this can fly across a flight path, so near to the district where it is heavily populated, and then towar the diretion of the Pentagon and yet we have heard nothing about this on the! news. I have to believe some of these pilots or our own radar would pick something this strange up.  Anyway, there is no doubt whatsoever in our minds what we witnessed last night.  I hope this helps and I hope I hear something more about this.  Thank you<n>

Clear night with a few scattered clouds.  I would compare it to a &#34;connect the dots&#34; snake moving accross the sky rather quickly with no sound.  I thought it was a flock of birds, but the altitude was too high, no sound at all coming from it and it was moving entirely too quickly.  (Besides, most birds have gone south by this time).  The lights were almost vibrating as it was a fluid motion, but not completely straight.  I would estimate it was approximatly 1500 yds. in the sky, but could have been much higher.<n>

Lemmon, from Ski Valley, near the upper section of the road repairs section, when in front of us we saw an object with bright flashing lights. This lights where making sort of a &#34;horizontal 8&#34; movement, changing from white to pink, blue and red. The object was moving NE - SW towards the city of Tucson (left to right from our perspective at a low altitude. The flashing lights might make someone believe it to be an airplane, but the airplanes I&#39;ve seen have stationery lights in the front, bottom or tips of their wings. This looked as if the bottom of the craft had many lights and different colors. We continued moving and didn&#39;t see if the craft kept on moving or landed or changed directions. I recall 2 more cars on the road down that evening, and we encountered other cars going up the road; maybe someone else saw something. We do not believe this to be an airplane.<n>
11/19/00 17:58|Benicia|CA|Other|30 Seconds|Observed: elliptical object with unusual light|12/9/00|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/015/S15399.html|85|ndxe200011| Observed: elliptical object with unusual light<n> <n><n> <n><n> (Report was written 1 hour after sighting) This evening I saw something interesting as I was traveling home after a weekend at Tahoe.  This occured at 5:58 pm, this Sunday.  I didn&#39;t drive, so I was passing the time looking at landmarks, lights, and stars in the sky.  As we were passing Benicia on hwy 680, I noticed, at my 1 o&#39;clock, what at first appeared to be a low-level aircraft passing to our right.  What caught my eye is that it didn&#39;t have standard lighting: I saw no red/green indicator lights, tail lights, forward lights.  My attention was drawn to a light or lights on what appeared to be the leading edge of the object, gold in color, and blinking in a random fashion.  I would almost describe this point-source as &#34;sparkling&#34;.  Within a few seconds of my initial sighting, this point-source grew in size.  At that point, the light would &#34;blink&#34; randomly, and as it did so, it would grow into a triangle whose longest sides pointed down.  The triangular light&#39;(s)  downward-facing vertex was approx. 4 times as tall as the shortest side.  All edges of the light were of the same sharpness and intensity.  As the light grew, it appeared to be composed on many smaller lights, and it continued to blink in an irregular fashion. Naturally, this caught my attention, since it didn&#39;t exhibit conventional aircraft lighting or other recognizable features.  I continued to watch as it appeared to angle away from the bearing of the highway.  It appeared to grow distant, and the shape of leading-edge light returned to a point source, which appeared to sparkle.  As I continued to watch, there was one point where this object was briefly illuminated, perhaps by city lights (it appeared to be reflected light)  It was at this point I could see a lighter outline in the night sky.  My first impression was the shape was similar to a blimp, except it was more elongated, and the &#34;ends&#34; of the shape weren&#39;t at all like a blimp (no stabilizers or canopies were visible).  The shape ended in squared-off points, and the edges leading to the more curved shape in the middle appeared jagged. Otherwise, the shape was roughly elliptical, with the long axis approx. 3 times longer than the short axis. The point-source was clearly on the front &#34;point&#34;, and the light appeared to change shape randomly.  I saw this object for about 30 seconds, from 30 to 15 degrees from the horizon (its apparent position lowered over time), and when the illuminated shape subtended about the width of a nickel at arm&#39;s length.<n>

She had twisted her chain up so as I got that straightened out I was looking at the stars. I&#39;m familure with the planets and with how airplanes look as they pass over. I saw nothing unusual until I looked toward the north. There I saw a bright light come on. It grew in brightness until at one point it was brighter than the planet jupiter. It only tooks a few seconds to grow in brightness, then it went out. The total time the light was on was about 8 seconds.  When it went out I could barely make out a small light that was dimmer than a very distant star and much smaller than an airplane. I watched it travel for a few seconds when another light, just like the first, came on in front of it. It did the same with the light coming on then going out. I watched them take turns doing this with several seconds in between the time one light would go bright. When the two were dim they didn&#39;t have any blinking lights on them at all that I could see. When they were nearly out of my view I saw another light, the same as the first two, come on go out but it was going in the opposite direction.  I watched it do that for several times then went to get my husband. When he came out none were to be seen, even though the 3rd light should have been visible. We watched and saw no lights, not even those of planes.  The first two were coming from a south-east direction going north-west while the 3rd was taking the same path only in the opposite direction.<n>

It held a stationary position. I pulled over to a rest stop. I had a video camera with me. We were coming from a party. I was not drinking. My wife handed me the camera and I got out to see if I could zoom in on it. My camera is not the greatest. As I zoomed in and it started to take shape, the veiw became distorted and shaky. I drew back the shot and got a good shot of the distance in height compared to the tree lining. A car pulled in and a guy asked what I was looking at. I pointed up to him and asked what he thought it was. He said a balloon or something. His friend thought it might be a helicopter. I said that a balloon would pop at that height and it would be moving. I thought that a helicopter wouldn&#39;t be able to reach that height. They both looked in the camera and said that they couldn&#39;t figure it out. Another car pulled in and a lady asked what I thought it was. The shape of the object, almost looked like a cluster of balloons. My four year old son could see the object also. I decided to get back into my car since the object was really doing anything. My wife asked if she could look through the camera, to see it up close. While she was looking at it, I notice a small plane coming towards us. I asked my wife for the camera so I could get both in the same shot. I figured this might be a good way to see the distance in height and size. The plane was alot lower and alot closer to us. I recorded the plane and zoomed in on it. When I drew back to get both objects it was gone. I panned around the area to see if it moved. I couldn&#39;t find it again. I don&#39;t beleive that the plane had anything to do with it because the plane was alot lower and seemed to be already passed it. We didn&#39;t notice any lights or sound. The sky was a light gray do to the time of the day.<n>

The altitude of the object was below one thousand feet, and as it got directly overhead it tilted it&#39;s nose toward us, showing a flattened shape and two fins running from nose to tail. The craft then righted itself, then wobbled from side to side as it continued on toward the east. It was travelling faster than a balloon would, especially since there was very light wind at the time. It was black in color, and we could not see any markings or windows on it, but I am very familiar with all known aircraft, have a very open mind, and I can state with certainty that this was not a known aircraft. The object appeared to be approximately thirty feet in length and made no noise.<n>

Had Binoculars, as I was looking for the Leonids a night late, and the objects were long and thin, horizontal.  Objects moved at a steady pace until they dissappeared out of view behind a house, moving lower on the horizon.  These did NOT appear to be meteorites at all.  The formation and objects remained unchanged for the 15 or so secodns I saw them moving and they appeared to be in the very upper atmosphere or out of it completely.  Frickin&#39; weird looking, and a bit eerie, basically because they were so nondescript and moved slower than meteorites I&#39;ve seen, but faster than jets I&#39;ve seen.<n>

A golden amber color. One ws comming from the northwest, and the other almost intercepted it from the north. The one that was comming from the north was moving at first, then it stood stationary for about 5 min. The other light was moving slowly towards the south, Over Walnut Creek. Then the light that was stationary started to move. It just started to move straight up in the air. And then moved south. It must have climbed for about 5 seconds, but in that 5 seconds, it moved upward until it was almost a small light, then, it moved south. Both crafts had no sound, they had bright yellowish golden lights, and when they flew over head, there were two other lights on either side of the bright light. The bright light was in the shape of a star. It had points on it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Might be landing lights on an airliner.  Just a guess.  PD))<n>

Three points of white, steady light in the sky, moving together.  About star brightness.  Lights made a near isoceles triangle in shape.  Approx 20, 75, and 85 degree corners with the acute angle leading the formation.  Heading  due east.  First saw the lights directly overhead in the constellation of Cassiopeia.  They did not outline a solid object because stars passed behind the line of the lights and remained visible.  Lights moved slowly, like a high altitude jet.  Distance between the front light and the rear lights was about three thumbnails at arms legnth.  Distance between the two tail lights was about one thumbnail at arms length.  Lost sight of the lights behind a cloud bank just before they passed the Seven Sisters star cluster.  Lights did not appear to emerge on the other side of the cloud bank.  The line of flight was can be illustrated by drawing a line between the mid point star in Cassiopeia and the Seven Sisters cluster.  Sighting lasted one and a half to two minutes.  Have not been able to ascertain if there was any air traffic overhead as of yet.  Noise from the highway and residential area prevented me from hearing anything other than that.  Very similar to two previous sightings of the same nature I have experienced, and reported, but not to this organization.<n>

Since that report I always pay careful attention to the skies.  I want to see what I seen that night, nobody belives my friend &#34;((name deleted))&#34; and I about what we saw.  We were scared and we left that night after seeing that, we didn&#39;t bother to stop.  I regret that.  Well this past Saturday my girlfriend was driving to collinsville to make her carpayment.  She drove and while on horseshoe lake road I glanced over in the general aarea where our first sighting happened to be.  I saw the exact same thing!!!  My girlfriend didn&#39;t look and got scared but I was fine.  We were only about 4 miles away from my original sighting.  On Sunday after the sighting me and my friend &#34;kyle&#34; went to see this area.  To see if there was anything at all we could find to support my sighting.  We didn&#39;t find anything.  But we did see something I think you and everybody would be very interested to know.  The name of the farm near our sighitng is called &#34;secret acres&#34;.  In fact the man was very cautious about letting us near the sights.  I did research and there used to be an old air field in that area as well.  THANK YOU<n>

It was a very clear night and the stars were shining nicely. I layed on my back in the driveway to look into the sky as I often do on nights like this. There was a couple of planes in the sky, one local and one in the distance. My Lady and I both noticed a light travelling at a very quick pace. This object was moving across the sky from NW due SE and appeared to be very high up. The light was bright and appeared white. She asked me what I thought it was and we both thought it may be a sattelite, which was a bit out there because we were in the city. We have been out at the Salton Sea and seen a sattelite clearly along with a nice view of the Milky Way. This object was clear and moving across the Pasadena sky, which has a lot of light pollution. The object had just passed above us, at the same high altitude, and started to change in color from white to red and then it vanished. It was a very clear night, and this object did not have a blinking beacon like all other craft in the sky!<n>

The ceiling was pretty low, probably 2000 feet.  The object was very visible against the thick gray/white clouds which were illuminated by the lights of the city.  The object was silent and had no lights or distinguishing marks.  The object was traveling north directly over the Hudson.  I first noticed the object when it was directly above me and watched it travel north about a mile, it then made a right turn and headed east over mid-town Manhattan.  It flew into a very thick area of clouds above the buildings and disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Time and date are approximate.  PD))<n>

The other one i seen was in 1989, it was a florcient blue and cigar shaped. a friend of mine and i where near a park named dehoise park and there it was hovering over some trees that overlooked the lake.

This is mounted outside my home office window so that I can gaze at the night sky while working (I am a self-employed technical illustrator).  I was experimenting with recording the image to video tape.  I have captured many meteors and satellites and airplanes. At 20:18 I noticed what looked like a slow moving meteor.  As it travelled across the monitor it made two abrupt ~15 degree turns. I did catch it on the video tape, so if you would like a copy, I will send it. After thinking about it for a day, I was pretty sure that it must have been a slow meteor that changed course because of its shape, but the following night I had another siting.  I had not set up the video system since we had gone out for the evening,  When we got home I took the I-3 peice with the Nikon lens out just to do a little star gazing.  After about 10 minutes I noticed what seemed to be a fast satellite.  I tracked it as it went East to West.  About 45 degrees above the western horizon, it abruptly may a 90 degree turn to the North and vanished behind trees.(this happened at 21:20 pst). No recording of this object. I have decided to purchase a dedicated video tape recorde for this Image intesifier and hope to catch more interesting objects.<n>

It caught my attention because the left wing lights were blinking like the craft was signaling a turn.  On the left wing there were three white lights equally distanced apart.  On the right wing there were only two lights, a white and a red.  They were located at the outside and inside ends of what I thought was the right wing of a large airplane.  I was driving north on route 95 at 70 mph.  After a few moments of observing the craft I realized that it was stationary in the sky.  The vehicles separated, the one on the left was lower and the one on the right went up.  The two crafts remained within a matter of yards of one another.  As I continued to watch the crafts I saw the upper craft launch a fireball in a northward direction.  It resembled a shooting star in the night sky.  The fireball followed a strait trajectomry until it disappeared from view in the distance.  I pulled into a rest area parking lot to continue watching the crafts.  The two crafts moved slowly to the south, continuing to maintain a pairing.<n>

As thay got closer we could see that one was smaller than the other.The larger one stoped moving compleatly as the smaller one started to dart from side to side. The smaller one shot strait up compleatly out of veiw then appeared again what seemed like several miles behind us.My Girl freind and i watched in silence as the larger of the two craft started to decend towards the ground aprox 1/2 a km infront of us. i couldent beleave what i was seeing as i had never experianced any thing like that befor and was (you could say,Very sceptical about things like that!!!!).The larger one seemed to land behind some trees,There was a bright blue/green light but apsolutly no sound!It was very quiet so we could of herd somthing but there was no noise.My girl freind at this point nuged me in the ribs an pointed at the smaller one of the two.It was getting closer to us,I could see that it was diamond shaped,Even though the larger of the two had been distinctly trianguler.At this piont we jumped back in the car and sped away very quickly.<n>

The only reason the lights caught our attention was thier percieved hieght. We both quickly dissmissed them as a low flying airplane. (note: these lights seemed far away and appeared to be moving very slowly.) We turned west off of the north bound road we were travling on. Drove west about 100 yards and turned north into the wooded driveway. The driveway is about 75 yards long and curves to the east to face the house which rests on a hill in a clearing. A soon as we turned toward the house, into the clearing we where both shocked that this aircraft was allready about to fly over us. It was now obvious that this was no airplane. It appeared to be incredibly large. It was creaping overhead very very slowly. My girlfriend started to get out of the car to look at it. I was so shaken I tried to keep her in the car but she pulled away and got out leaving the door open. I then quickly got out too. looking up I couldn&#39;t make out the outline or even guess at the total size of the craft. It was a cloudy night and the sky was too dark too contrast between the aircraft and the sky. Not a single sound came from the thing. The air was still. It had a round blue light in the middle and three yellow lights in the pattern of a triangle. If this craft did not have lights it would have been invisable. It creeped over head very slowly and eventually went out of sight over the trees. We looked at each other and the I ran up the hill towards the house to watch it float away. Reaching the front porch I turned around to see the craft....it was gone. I cant understand how something that seemed so large could disapear so fast. It seemed huge. It was completely silent and then it just disapeared. Of coarse we went into the house and shared our story with the family inside. The thought we were joking with them but soon realized how disturbed we were by the event we had just witnessed..<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

I didn&#39;t feel comfortable, so I turned my quad around in the field and headed back South towards home, when I felt compelled to turn around again and face Northwest.As I did I seen two of the (glitter like objects) moving off to the South in a arching pattern, and two moving north. Rate of speed excedes what I have seen from commercial and military aircraft at that elevation.Once they left my periffial vision two very large orange spheres approximatly 2 inches apart from my perspective, and half the size of a moon after 12pm. appeared (explosion like) in the sky in the same location all the previous (glitter) activity took place. These spheres lasted about 5 to 6 seconds, from appearance to fade. In a seemingly pulsating motion. Then again as many as 6 to 10 various (glitter) activity began again in the same area. The 4 that left the area returned as well. Being very alarmed by what I seen, I raced to the house and told the husband to come out and see if he could view the same. From the time he got on the quad with me and headed North the time we hit the field 5 minutes might have passed. We did see the various patterns of (glitter) activity Move from one lacation to another, always staying in that Western area. knowing they were (NOT STARS), His otherwise skeptical nature was lost. we continued North in the field for a block and turned aroun facing South when we stopped and turned out the lights. Then at that moment, the Nothern most orange sphere showed itself in the very same fashion and location as it had previosly. All the (glitter) activity then consintrated around it. He was thinking they were millitary jets, but the (glitters) were to eratic and in to close of proximity to each other for that to be possible. We did at that time return to our home uncomfo! rtable a nd baffled. I then took a vidio camera outside, I managed through the static on my camera to get some of the (glitter) on tape. During much of this activity there was a very low dull almost silent roar. Neither disipating or becoming closer. The sound as well was recorded on tape. After we were back in the house I tried to make several phone calls, but the phones were all a busy signal. About 20 minutes later, the folks I tried to call became available, none had saind they were on the phone at all.That it had to be our phone.<n>

I asked what are you looking at and he replied I don’t know.  Turning around I saw about 200 feet above me a motionless black object.  It made no sound.  It was a cube shape, approximately 25 feet on each side and it had no surface texture at all.  Its &#34;surface&#34; appeared to be a void collapsing into itself.  It seemed as if it were an abyss and drawing light into it.  I looked at it for about 5 seconds and it suddenly ascended at a rate that I would estimate being greater than 50,000 feet per minute.  (I am a licensed pilot) as it ascended, it made no sound but a bright white/blue/red/yellow light appeared on its underside.  In less than 4 seconds, this object climbed and disappeared vertically right into infinity.  We asked each other what the hell was that.  Dad mentioned that he thought it might have been what people call a UFO.  Three months later, I underwent emergency brain surgery for a cerebral fistula (blood vessel malformation that the doctors referred to as extremely life threatening.  I have no idea if these circumstances are related but the thought that this encounter may have been related is quite chilling.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

They were standing on their bases with the long point of the triangle pointing straight up. They were a bright silvery-white. She immediately yelled into the house for me to come out and see. By time I got to the back deck, she said they had disappeared like someone turning off a light. At the same time my wife was on her way to work in Williamston MI. heading south on  M-52, when she noticed one triangle setting motionless in the southwest sky. She described it as a triangle sitting on its base with the point of the long end pointing straight up. It was a bright silvery-white and a little bigger than a dime held at arms length.

It was huge--larger than one of the buildings, triangular in shape with a huge round shaped base surrounded by lights.  There were no other cars on the road at that time.  I didn&#39;t say anything to my daughter, thinking that I somehow imagined it.  She yelled out to look at it--so I knew that huge thing really was there.  We were only 5 miles from the airport so we drove to the airport to see if anything had landed at the airport that could explain what we thought we saw.  We waited, but nothing close to that size landed at the airport. I still don&#39;t know what we saw, but it certainly cured me of looking for UFO&#39;s--I never want to see one again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date of event is approximate.  PD))<n>

11/15/00 01:00|Hartford|ME|Unknown|1 hour|I'm fairly sure the glow from the woods was not caused by human activity.|11/6/14|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/114/S114530.html|126|ndxe200011| I&#39;m fairly sure the glow from the woods was not caused by human activity.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I just wanted to share something that may be of interest. It was around the year 2000 in mid November in Hartford, Maine, a rural town of about 800 people.  From 1993 to 2005, I would make my annual deer hunting trip to my cousin &#34;Jane &#34; and her husband, &#34;John&#34;s&#34;(not real names), place in Hartford.  I drove up from southern Connecticut and would plan on being there each year during that time for about 10 days each time being in the middle of November.  They owned and lived on about 60 acres of prime deer hunting land.  95% of their land was pristine Maine hardwoods.  John was an avid outdoorsman, a hard working guy and very protective of his family and property.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was a Saturday night and since there was no hunting allowed on Sunday, John and I stayed up late watching TV and chatting as we had many things in common.  It was a cold clear night  (about 20 deg F) and I suggested that we sit out the back deck and enjoy some star gazing (it was around midnight).  We were on the deck over looking a field that he cleared out some years prior that extended out about 300 feet to a 2 foot tall rock wall.  Just at that point and beyond it was an all hardwood tree line extending left to right for quite a distance.  There were no homes,buildings, roads or streetlights or any source of lighting back there in the woods.  There were few close by neighbors and none of those properties were anywhere close to the area I described. I knew the lay of the land very well and it was pitch dark. We were facing in a northerly direction.  It was a moonless night as well.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As we were talking for a while, I noticed a &#34;glow&#34; of light illuminating the bottom of the trees at the above mentioned tree line extending up to the upper branches.  It was not real bright, not dim but somewhere in the middle but it was there.  The glow was white , the best I can describe, was like the headlights of the newer cars these days.  There was no noise, no movement and the glow stayed at the same intensity and did not move either.  It covered a wide swath, left to right.  In a scary movie, one would expect to see the dark outline of some creature leaving the woods with the &#34;glow&#34; as a backdrop!  Anyway after a few minutes of seeing this, I said :&#34;John do you see what I see?&#34;  &#34;See what?&#34; &#34;That glow in the woods&#34; &#34;What glow?&#34; &#34;oh yeah...wanna go out an take a look?&#34;  &#34;Ahhh no John thanks&#34;  &#34;Oh come on lets go out there and look.... are ya chicken?&#34;  &#34;Yes I am&#34;  &#34;Oh well, I guess your not that interested then&#34; That was that!<n> <n><n> <n><n> We stayed on the deck for at least another hour, John was just chatting away like nothing was wrong and I, well, kept one eye on the glow!  The glow was still there when we went inside about 2am.  The next morning I scoured that area behind the tree line for several hours and found no trace of anything unusual.  There was no trail back there and no real access by any type of vehicle.  I never again saw the glow on my return trips, nor did I ever see it before.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Upon my return trips after the event I would ask John about what we saw that night.  His answer was always the same &#34;hey, you didn&#39;t want to out and look that night so..........&#34; And he would just change the subject.  I never did get his take on what we both saw that night. John was not a practical joker.  In fact during that event he was recovering from an auto accident and had limited mobility-it took all he had to go hunting with me that year so setting up an elaborate ruse to scare the begeezus out of me is of out of the question.  But for a guy who had the safety of his family and the privacy of his land at the top of his important list..that glow we saw caused him no alarm.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It&#39;s a mystery to me just what was going on out there!  John knew SOMETHING and even my cousin Jane was closed mouth about it as well.  John passed in 2011, never saying anything about what we saw unless I brought it up and his answer,again, was always the same as mentioned above.  I have asked Jane many times about the strange glow in the woods that night after Johns passing and well, she would just kind of ignore the question and move the conversation in a different direction.  So for me, the 64 dollar question is has anyone ever seen anything like this?  It was not the Northern Lights as I have seen that up in Maine before.  What I saw was from the ground up.  It was not anything that was the result of human activity that I could explain.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Just a little about me personally:  I&#39;m now 57 years old.  I&#39;m a high school graduate and work for the local power company as a transmission/substation supervisor.  I have been with the Company for 36 years.  I was, for 10 years, a seasonal Lake Patrol Officer with a local lake authority/ State DEP Law Enforcement.  I am an active Ham radio operator and a history buff and I love to read.  In my younger days, I was into astronomy.  I have NO rational explaination for what I saw that night.  I have an open mind when it comes to UFO&#39;s or other events that can&#39;t be easily explained away.<n>

Whilst outside I looked out North into the night sky when I spotted what I thought to be a bright star just above the roof top of the house behind us. I continued looking and this light suddenly became brighter and it was moving.  Seeing this light, I initially thought that it may have been a helicopter or a plane headed due South.  However, this light was moving too slowly for it to be either of these crafts.  It was just one solid light with no flashing strobe lights that are present on aircraft and helicopters.  I then thought it may have been the blimp but this light was too high in the sky for it to be a blimp.  We live about 22 miles from Lindbergh Field Airport but this light was no aircraft per se as I see them every night and this was nothing like the behavior of an aircraft. This light continued heading directly South and every now and then, the light became brighter as if slowly pulsing.  Occasionally the light would diminish a fraction but then it would come back to its normal intensity.  I continued watching it and the speed was very slow.  At one point it seemed as if it had come to a halt in mid air, but then continued on.  As it got closer I became aware that it made an acute right angled turn as it headed East. This had my curiosity really piqued, so I went back inside and got our binoculars to observe this light more closely.  I was able to pick it up and once again I saw the light increase in intensity.  As I followed it with my binoculars, it suddenly vanished completely.  I lowered my binoculars to see if I could pick it up again with the naked eye but it had gone. The slowness of the light and the acuteness of the turn told me that this was no aircraft.  What it was I do not know!  I have also witnessed other sightings and my husband and my son have also witnessed a couple of sightings  with me. This light may have possibly been a weather balloon, a satellite,  the space shuttle or something along those lines, but I feel that is was something else because of the speed of it and also the angle of path that it travelled when it went East.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness corrected date of incident to 14NO00.

One was descending faster then the other and what was strange we did not see the aircraft at that time we thought it might have blown apart or something but as soon as the glowing yellow streeks vanished the aircrafts beacon turned on passing over the same place where the objects were seen<n>

We had both made a comment about the flash. Not thinking to much about it we drove on without saying to much more. We continued to drive until we hit I-90, at about exit 109(about 15 miles from where we saw the flash)my partner told me to &#34;look, do you see what i think i see!&#34; looking toward the direction he was pointing i saw very clearly 3 bright lights that seemed to be connected in some way hovering in the sky. While i continued driving he watch the lights in the sky. He then told me that there was 2 sets of lights, when i looked i saw both sets of 3 lights in the sky. Before looking back toward the road the set of lights that were to the bottom left of the original set had suddenly disapeared. As i drove on he said holly sh** the other one just went straight upward into the cloud cover. Thats the last we saw of either craft. One of the strange things about both the flash and the sets of lights we saw, is both the instances caused the C B in our truck to quit working.<n>

I commented to him that I didn&#39;t remember ever seening those lights(me thinking that the lights were street lamp type lighting) on his land before and he looked at me like I was an idiot and he had no clue of what I was talking about. All of a sudden the balls of light vanished and reappeared in a matter of about 10 seconds. We pulled the truck over and got out to watch the lights. By this time there were five orange lights. One light would disappear for a few seconds and another would disappear and then reappear. It seemed as if the lights were on a timer or flashing a signal of some kind. We observed this for 15-20 minutes until the lights were gone. The lights always stayed in a half circle formation and all stayed in the same spot. This was not an airplane and there was no sound.<n>
11/13/00 21:00|Heflin|LA|Diamond|15 minutes|December 29, 2000 Dear NUFORC, I’m writing in concern of a sighting of a craft  that I saw 13 years ago, and again, recently, an encoun|1/3/01|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/015/S15625.html|136|ndxe200011| December 29, 2000 Dear NUFORC, I’m writing in concern of a sighting of a craft  that I saw 13 years ago, and again, recently, an encounter of two crafts completely different in size and shape.  First, I’ll start with the  sighting 13 years ago, in November of 1987.  While driving through the Blue Ridge Mts. Of West Virginia, as a truck driver, I was carrying a load of glassware that was picked up in Springfield, Ohio and going to Roanoke, Virginia.  That night I noticed the moon shining brightly to the right side of me.  It had just stopped raining and the sky was clear.  At exactly 8:45 p.m. I saw this bright light coming closer and closer. Thinking it was a head light on a plane or helicopter, I didn’t think much of it, but as it got closer, I started seeing the shape of it.  I began to slow down to about 45 mph (I was previously going the speed limit ), and that’s when it cleared the trees.  It was going 3 or 4 feet over the trees, just barely enough to clear the tops.  The craft was a saucer shape with a little round dome on the top and flat on the bottom. It had no windows, exhaust, rivets, or bolts—just smooth all over and one headlight shining in a downward angle. I let the windows down and couldn’t hear anything, it didn’t make a sound.  I t just fluttered the tops of the trees as it passed. 	Again, recently, on November 13th, 2000 around the same time, I was visiting my parents in North Louisiana, 40 miles southeast of Shreveport, La. The moon was shining just as bright as in the year of ’87.  I was driving in my mother’s car, visiting friends, when I came around a curve, passing the home of a childhood friend and saw these lights in a diamond-shape. It was hovering 25 or 30 feet in the air.  At first glance I mistook it for a new light tower, because it had been a while since I had been in the country. Then I saw it in it’s entirety over a cow pasture right near the highway about 20 to 30 yards away.  As soon as I saw it I pulled over and cut my headlights off.  I let the window down to see if I could hear any sounds it was making.  What I heard was a soft blowing sound, like if to blow into a microphone softly.  The craft was about the size of a city bus—at least 40 or 50 feet long.  It had a white light, at what I suppose, was the head of craft., also shining in a 240 degree downward angle, similar to the one I had saw 13 years earlier.  But this craft had 8 lights on it. At the three adjacent corners of the diamond shape, were red lights, and on the sides between them were four white lights.  It seemed as soon as I had pulled over and turned my headlights out, did it began to lift up, leaning to the left, then to the right, and then pulled away slowly. I saw it 3 more times over other wide spaces but could never see how the top of it was formed—just the diamond-shaped bottom of the craft. 	This must’ve been a active night for crafts, because by the time I had made it back to my parents’ home, about 11:15 that night, I saw a second craft.  I was standing outside of my father’s carport, just looking at the sky, still amazed by what I had just seen.  I then saw another craft flying at a much higher elevation than the first ones I had seen.  There were no lights on it and it was also flying at a faster speed. It was about as high in the air as an airplane. It seemed to have a triangular shape with a double-circle on the bottom-side of each point like possible exhausts.  It was flying northward. 	The most amazing thing to me about these stories is that these were three encounters I had had.   I often wonder, &#34;why me&#34;, because there are very  few people who claim to see such sightings.  Whether it is coincidental or just a blessing, but I feel special that I had seen them.  I don’t recall any encounters while growing up in the country.  I can’t give a reason for why I was in the right places at the right time.  Nor am I doing this for publicity. It’s just that I believe in what I saw and I stand behind my story—word for word. I thank all those who hear and believe my story. Sincerely, ((name deleted)) Sr.<n>

It literally glistened in the darkening sky.  The object was huge, about the size of a baseball at arms length.  It appeared to be at least ten thousand feet altitude at 45 degrees.  It was not the moon, as the full moon was visable during the sighting.  The object followed the I-75 corrider through Fort Myers on the west coast of Florida.  I was west of the object looking east.  It became visable to me over the southeast portion of town and then it moved slowly north for about one minute.  I tried to reason this sighting as possibly a blimp.  But then it disapeared completely and reappeared roughly 5 miles north in less than 10 seconds.  It continued moving north slowly about four more minutes and faded in the distance behind cloud cover.  It appeared to be headed towards the Sarasota and Tampa area.  This object had to be sighted by many other people.  It looked like a well lit condominium building flying through the sky.<n>

Driving past the rail road I saw a bright white light up in the sky over a wooded area.  It was  was betweeen a rectangular and an oval shape.  Being suprised, I turned my car immidiately around and parked on the side of the road to look.    I watched his light for about another 2-3 minutes.  It did not move up, down or to either side.  It just stayed in the same place.  Then it began to slowly fade awa.  It just became dimmer and dimmer until it was completly gone.     I am not by any means saying this was a  UFO, Alian or other.  I do not believe in UFOs, Aliens, the Easter bunny, or  God.   However, I saw this light and could not identify it other than to say I never say one before in my 38 yrs.  Two other vehicles passed , one while it was there and the next while it was fadding away. I do not know if they saw this too.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We have spoken with this witness on several occasions, and find him to be exceptionally credible.

I retrieved my camcorder and by the time I started recording it burst and many lights gathered around the object.  The main object was a twisting cylinder or worm.  It looked organic like a single cell organism.  I recorded this object for about 20 minutes as it traveled from West to East then N/E.  The local Griffith Park Astronomers thought it could be a string of balloons, but dismissed the idea because of the way it maneuvered.<n>

They drove toward it, flashing their lights from their vehicle. The craft &#34;doubled&#34; it&#39;s height, and started to move west along the rail road tracks. The sighting was near a soon to be golf course in vail. Aprox 2 miles north of I-10 interstate. That area is in a depression or valley. As the craft moved west, 2 A-10 aircraft tried to follow it. It increased in speed and lost the A-10 aircraft. The color of the craft was a &#34;glow in the dark&#34; light green/white. It had a red light at &#34;pointed&#34; aft end. It was encircled with different colored lights around the perimeter. It made no noise during any movement. My daughter says that there was a dark area, like a windshield on the upper &#34;dome&#34;.

The object was darker than the night sky, because when it went overhead the night sky helped to determine its shape.  Truely an awesome sight.<n>

Our sightings began at, approximately, 22:30 on 11/12. I was working at one of our computers with a southern view through a window of our home office. Laura came in to say good night and asked &#34;What is that?&#34; I looked up out the window and we both saw an unusually bright light in a clear sky with the moon near full. She said &#34;It&#39;s changing colors.&#34; I have a color perception deficiency and could not distinguish the various color changes. We went outside with the video camera recorded the changing light object for about a half hour. Consequently, I have video tape of the same type of slowly moving, color changing light object in the western and northern sky from two other nights, including last night 11/18. One or more of the people here have seen several others since Sunday 11/12/00 that were not video recorded.

UFO or spacegarbage, either way it was an awesome sight.|12/2/00|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/014/S14925.html|146|ndxe200011| Large green light blurs across the night sky in populated NJ area.  UFO or spacegarbage, either way it was an awesome sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object was a rather large streak of green light that flashed half way across the sky.  It had to have been seen by a bunch of people because it was somewhere over somerville NJ, which has a big population.  I was driving on 202 heading inside of somerville when the event occured. It was in the sky directly above the road.  Anyone who was driving at around 10:00 on 202 had a great chance of seeing it.  It was pretty high up, but awfully big and bright enough that it grabbed my attention.  The driver in front of me even slammed on the brakes for a second.  But as quick as it came it also left.  The flash of green which had streaks of yellow and blue behind it only was around for about maybe two seconds.  It was pretty intense.  Im guessing that it probably was a piece of falling space garbage.  Or something like that.  But the thing that bothered me was the size of it. It was a rather large green blur of light.  And also that afterwords i saw a pair of helicopters in the area. This may not be related to anything that happened (whatever it was), but who knows. Plus the idea that it could have been a UFO is a pretty neat.  I believe in them. And I sure wouldn&#39;t throw out a ufo sighting as the source of the odd green lightstreak.  Im wondering if anyone has any further information on this possible sighting, there was nothing in the papers on monday or tuesday.  Maybe someone knows a bit more about it.<n>

We turned onto La Brea from Franklin and were now facing south.  We had a clear view south and I noticed a couple of planes on the horizon along with some else to the south east that I guessed was a plane also.  I pointed it out to my girlfriend and we both kept an eye on it while I continued to drive.  Clearly it was not a plane and now took a crved C shape while it floated around.  Now I thought it was a parachute and I looked for a man attached under it.  But there was no man and the object did not drop down, instead it continued to float and contort.  I pulled over around La Brea and Santa Monica blvd and we watched.  The object was silver in color and now straightened out, then bunched up, then formed a V and continued turning over.  The whole process resembled an earth worm contorting around in the sky.  About this time I noticed a small white sphere under the larger object.  In the air around the sphere there seemed to be some sort of disturbance.  Giving the appearance of an &#34;exhuast,&#34; if you will.  The sphere slowly moved away and to the left and this process continued until I counted seven sphere&#39;s in the sky along with the big object.  We watched as the object kept moving south east until it was out of our sight.  Did any one else see this!?<n>

Phoenix.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At about 6:20 am MST on Sunday, November 12th,  I was going outside to Get my paper, when and saw it wasn&#39;t there yet so I turned to go back inside and saw a light about the size of a big star moving towards me from the  South West.  The first thing I noticed was that it was moving fast and smoothly. I thought UFO? Then I thought  no, Airforce jet. Then I realized it was moving too fast,  and had an odd floating sense about it. I continued to watch and it wavered a litle twice which tipped me off that wasn&#39;t a conventional craft.  It started at about twenty degrees off the horizon and kept coming towards me and slightly curving. It started out about the size of a big star and was the size of high altitude aircraft light. It was either very high and moving VERY fast, or very low and EXTREMELY small. There was absolutely no noise,  It was just after dawn and the full moon was low to the W. Northwest so there was plenty of light to see if there any conventional stucture. There was none.  The light was white and there were no other colored lights to indicate any kind of coventional craft.   It continued to move overhead and to the Northeast until it was out of site. The whole thing too k 3-4 minutes and it moved faster than any plane at a high altitude, even the airforce jets of which I am familiar with.  I have spent most of my 37 years in phoenix and have been watching the Phoenix skies since I was a kid, but very consistantly for the past 16 years. I spent  I am very familiar with the air traffic in the area. I spent ten of those years outside at night almost every night for 5-8 hours because of insomnia, and because as an actor and artist I have a very hard time winding down after  work. For the past 2 years I have been riding my bike at night for 1-4 hours.  I have seen many UFO&#39;s in the past four years in the valley. It has become almost common place. I tried to report one to you several years ago but was followed by what I realized was a man in black, and had someone come into my back yard one night! and was just a couple of feet from my open screened window.  I thought I woud try the website this time.  I have better than 20-20 vision, and excellent night vision which I didn&#39;t need this time because there was plenty of light.   I had the odd sensation that &#34;it&#34;or &#34;they&#34; knew I was watching it.<n>

11/11/00 17:30|Bend|OR|Circle|2-3minutes|Round silvery object  above city, possibly car size mylar balloon,seen from a few miles away slowly ascended till out of sight.|12/2/00|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/014/S14972.html|158|ndxe200011| Round silvery object  above city, possibly car size mylar balloon,seen from a few miles away slowly ascended till out of sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was reviewing the recent reports on your site as I do every couple of weeks to see what is being supposedly seen. I just noted the sighting reported from Bend, Oregon and I need to chime in that I saw that and took two photos, yet to be developed. I was at the Pilot Butte Oregon State Park, which is a large conical volcanic cinder butte which has a road to the top and there were probably ten or twelve other folks up there then at the viewpoint overlooking Bend and vicinity..  My wife works at the nearby ((deleted)) and I had about 15 minutes to wait till I picked her up as she got off at 5P.M..  The place has a great view down to the city of Bend and you can also look over to the Three Sisters Mountains to the west about 25 miles. I had been watching the sunset going down over Mt. Bachelor south of the Three Sisters. There was a high thin cloud layer above the 10,000 foot summits of those mountains, and over Bend.. After a few minutes of watching the sunset I took a few minutes to walk over to the east side to look down on the side where I could see the building  below where my wife worked. The sunset was creating a great shadow of the Pilot Butte Cone which was stretching some length of miles across the flat land to the east of town. By chance I had my camera in my car and I took a photo of the long conical shadow, but because it was dimming light I thought to myself that the photo probably would&#39;nt come out with much contrast or detail. As I walked back to my car on the west side of the overlook parking area I spotted this silver circle slowly rising to the west of Bend. I was looking down at it at first and it appeared to be several hundred feet above the ground already, but below my vantage point.  It looked like it might have risen from the forest area just west of the city limits.  My impression of it was that it was probably a large balloon, perhaps the size of a car, and probably three or four miles distant. My second impression was, is that a UFO? It deffinately appeared round and silver, but I did not see any lights or anything else of distinction on it. There was enough light left in the evening sky to see it pretty well and know that it was not a plane, copter, ultra light, hot air balloon or blimp. It was going very slowly up and drifting slightly north and east and coming for a time closer to my location as it ascended.. I felt this to be consistant with the light wind direction. I had seen a weather balloon launched just a few days before at the Salem, Oregon airport and it rose at a similar pace.  However it did not have that kinda inverted teardrop shape nor the hanging attachment of instruments like a weather balloon does. In that I had intended to photograph the great setting sun silhouette of the mountains, I went ahead and took two photos then with the circular object pretty much centered in the frame, just in case it was really a UFO..  By then the object had risen to about eye level and was above the tops of the distant mountains from my vantage point. I have not developed that roll of film yet, and at best it would probably appear no bigger on the print than this period&gt;. unless enlarged. If it is helpful, I! can pro vide a copy of those photos when developed. Had I observed any thing more out of the ordinary, like unusual maneuvers, I would have rushed that unfinished roll of film to the developer. I noticed several of the other folks at the top of the Butte looking at the object but nobody appeared too excited so I just presumed it to be a balloon and that they probably did too. In that it was time for me to go and pick up my wife by then,I drove on down the spiraling road from the top. Several minutes had elapsed and the object kept slowly floating up toward the high clouds. I lost sight of it as I spiraled down the road, and when I could&#39;nt spot it any longer I presumed it to have disappeared into the clouds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Time indicated is approximate.  It is an estimate of when sunset would occur in that part of Oregon.  We spoke with the witness, and find him to be quite credible.  He holds a responsible job.  PD))<n>

The highway at this point is surrounded by thick woods on both sides. Traffic was pretty heavy.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As we were driving I noticed an object in the distance, at first I didn&#39;t think too much of it but at it came closer and closer to the highway it gave detail to what it was (or what it wasn&#39;t).  This thing had people pulling over to the side of the road to view it.  It was obvious that it was not trying to hide because it seemed to just be observing the traffic.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Now for the detail...  This thing was so close I could have hit it with a rock.  It was the dim&#39;s of a saucer but with 4 large bubble shaped lights cross dividing it into somewhat of a pie shape, 2 of the the lights were turning blue while the other 2 lights were turning red.  The underside was bronze in color with very intricate detail.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was very obvious that it was definetly a maufactured vehicle but it was no way manufactured on this planet, the detail was uncanny.  I grabbed my friends shoulder and said &#34;what the heck is that?&#34;  He said &#34;I have no idea&#34;.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I thought to myself it couldn&#39;t be some type of top secret government project because why would it just come out into the open in front of so many people.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There&#39;s much more to this story which I will gladly share.

Multiple witness reports to 911.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had just left work when I noticed a bright red object moving very slowly over the center of Bend.  I at first thought was only an airplane, but after driving the few blocks to my house and parking I got out to find it &#34;hovering&#34; possibly 1000 feet above and to the east of my house.  It was a bright red circular or possibly disc shaped craft, with what appeared to be a smaller red light that seemed to revolve around the center of it (it almost appeared seperate from the larger shape at times). I asked a man coming out of a store to look at it and then I went into the store and had a young woman who works there, and another man come out to view it.  I then called the Bend Police Department&#39;s 911 line and reported it, and asked if they had any other reports of it, they said they did. My roommate then came home, and I had him look at it also.  We had a sighting a couple of years back that we also reported on this database, and this craft slowly dissappeared in the general direction as that one did, towards the now infamous cattle mutilation site of Sandy Springs to the south east of Bend.  We only just saw this thing, so I&#39;m going to call the Redmond airport and see if they have any information (I tried contacting the local newspaper but they were closed).  My roommate took a photo of it.  Right over the center of our town.  Wow.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke at length with this witness, and found him to be exceptionally convincing.  He has pursued facts surrounding the incident, to the extend of contacting the local news media, police, etc..

I noticed at about 70 degrees up in the Northwest a fixed object.  I watched it for at least 7 minutes and it never moved.  It was barely discernable to be like a cylinder, about the size of a grain of rice held at arms length. If you took a pencil and cut the eraser and the metal thing that holds it, that is the proportion.  The sky was clear blue.  I shifted my gaze several times and  even looked away to attempt to get my wife to come out of a shop she was in there.  Each time I expected it to &#39;be gone&#39; and not physical.  I fixed it over nearby landmarks and it never moved. Slowly, a small puffy cloud came from the  east and covered the object.  As the cloud moved on, the object had disappeared.<n>

The weather was sort of strange that day with lots of thick, low-lying clouds and light rain contrasted against an occasional burst of very bright afternoon sun making it through the clouds.  I saw a perfect rainbow in the sky and was so impressed with its clarity (a perfect arc with all colors visible from end to end) that I decided to pull over at the next rest stop and take a few pictures.  Stopped at a picnic area and waved hello to a hispanic family sitting at a picnic table before snapping a few shots.  Had just turned my camera from auto to off when i noticed a line of what i thought had to have been geese or a larger sort of bird because they were flying in a v-formation and alternating black and white, which i thought meant that their wings were black on one side and white on the other.  the longer i looked i realized that they were flying too high to be geese and too low to be an airplane.  As they got closer I began to notice that they were breaking off in to separate groups and then coming back together in a perfect line or v-shape, then they would do it again.  By the time they were directly overhead I was so overwhelmed that i didn&#39;t notice that my camera was turned off and wasn&#39;t clicking.  the hispanic family and i were all shouting back and forth and pointing up at the sky but we couldn&#39;t understand each other because of the language barrier.  By this time it was unquestionable that what was passing over us was a group of between 7 and 9 objects that were moving silently and independently as they flashed brightly in a pulsating way, chaning from black to bright white.  i finally figured out that my camera was turnede off and got a shot of them as they moved off towards the southwest.  the photo that i got back shows these lights grouped together in a weird pattern but it&#39;s really small. As far as my background, I&#39;m in horticultural sales and my company ships plants to many of the major chain-stores.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates two dates.

Suddenly it moved to the right (east) very fast and was lost to me behind some trees up ahead.  As the car proceeded south pass these trees I could not see the object anywhere.

I was nothbound on I75about a mile off the buck road onramp when I looked to the western sky I seen a large black square or rectangle in the sky. I slowed down as muh as I could to keep inveiw,but the traffic kept me going at a speed of 65mph and that put me in line with bridges and buildings that blocked my veiw. There was an airplane near it and at first I thought it might be a very large tarp of some sort being pulled by the plane but the plane was turning and doing a few maneauvers it seemed to get a better look and the object didnt move when the plane did so I figured it wasnt really attached in any way. The object made the plane look like an ant in size, so Iknow it was very big. It did seem to tilt or turn at one moment and it was very thin then went back to the veiw that made it look square. I seen a program on the discovery channel that had an object that looked pretty much identicle to it a couple weeks ago.<n>

It just was sitting there.  I went in again and when I came out it was gone.  It appeared to be a silver or grey color but I couldn&#39;t really see as it was so high.  The thing that impressed me was it&#39;s size, huge like a football field or larger.<n>

I asked my friends if they saw that they laughed and said no.  So I said to them look at the clouds how did the clouds get that shape then they said they don&#39;t know as it was not like that a moment ago.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Any way 1 mounth went by and one of my friends came to me and told me that he saw the craft that day but was afriad to say any thing about it as he did not wanted to be laughed at, then he confided in me a told me that he saw it, that morning.  He also went to say that he say it again, hovering in the sky for about 1/2 hr, and it shot up into the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I must also say that I have see a cly. shaped craft once when I was visiting in FL. and I called my cousin out and said to him, what is that in the shy, he being a non beliver, we noticed that it had no wings and was about 18000 ft in the sky, it made no sound, now I have seen many jet planes, and at even 40000 ft you can hear it and see wings, this was brown in color the shape was like a roll of foil paper.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.

My 17 year old cousin, my best friend and I were driving through this area called &#39;Satpur&#39;. The road we were on was really narrow, and on both sides, were fields, surrounded by mountains. Suddenly, we saw two green lights, about 200 metres, away from us, about 10 feet from the ground, travelling alongside us, at the same speed as us. At first, we though it was the reflection of another car&#39;s lights, but we looked behind and we were the only car on the road, so all three of us put down our windows. It was still there. We pulled off the road and stopped, suddenly, those lights, turned into one, larger green light, and stopped, and started hovering around. Suddenly, without a warning, it turned red and zipped up the mountain, in a straight line, right to the tip. It stayed there for a few minutes, and then, in a ball-like manner, sort of bounced down to the foot of the mountain, and came closer to us. We stayed put till it suddenly becam on huge green ball again, and started hovering around. We got frightened, and started driving real fast, at the speed of about 180 kmph. It kept up with us for a while, before it suddenly dissappeared in the trees. We went ahead for a while, to see if it emerged again, but it didn&#39;t. We took a u-turn, to head back homeward, when it popped up again, it was small and green, it arose skyward, slowly and it turned into two green lights, as it became faster, it became one red light. It just dissappeared into the sky, or out of it. My friend did take pictures of it, but we haven&#39;t yet developed them. Obviously, nobody who we told about this believed us. Oh, and it did make a very sofe whirring sound, which we only heard as it took to the sky for the last time.<n>

On the afforementioned date, the BBC switched their coverage to a Washington studio for a live interview with their Election Correspondent.  The time was approximately 08:47 (GMT).  The correspondent was seated in front of a window, through which a backdrop of night-time Washington was clearly visible.  As the interviewee was speaking, a UFO slowly &#39;drifted&#39; in from the top left corner of the window and hung motionlessly for the rest of the interview.  I would describe the object as disc-shaped (as viewed as a near side-on angle) and was a soft blue colour.  I have e-mailed the BBC to see if they could identify the &#39;object&#39; as a reflection, etc. but, as yet, they have not replied. There were two observers to this incident - myself and a housemate.  I am currently a first year psychology PhD student, aged 27 and my housemate is a research fellow, having recently completed his PhD in the same subject.  We are both based at ((Name deleted)) University, although my reporting of this incident has no association whatsoever to the Department or the University.<n>

The object was about at 1000ft, and appeared to sparkle with multi-colored lights of yellow, blue, red, green and white. It was beautiful. It moved slowly, then turned coming toward me, went in an ark over me, still high, at about 800+ feet. It then turned to the east again, and I watched it until it was out of my field of vision. I could not identify it as anything we have in the air now. It was awsome. My girlfriend and her husband also saw it, and thought it was spectacular.<n>

I kept her on the phone while my husband and I ran out to see.  We got our binoculars and the video camera.  While I talked to her, my husband video taped the light to the north.  We watched for 15 minutes.  It was directly over her house in Gilbert, Arizona on Cooper and Guadalupe in Gilbert, Az.  We saw a bright red light that vibrated and changed to amber, then back to red.  It seemed to &#34;float&#34; towards the east.  She said it was directly over her and she was looking at its&#39; &#34;belly.&#34;  This is what she said...&#34;I&#39;m looking straight up at its&#39; belly and it&#39;s triangular shaped. The lights are pulsating and a tiny white light just went it in and came out again.&#34; The red lights went from extremely bright to dim, to amber, to just a faint red.  A few times we thought it had gone but seconds later it came back again.  We watched the object for about ten minutes then it did what &#34;Bubba&#34; always does---it just DISAPPEARED! My daughters&#39; mother-in-law is visiting from Kentucky and unaware of our Bubba sightings.  She told my daughter she&#39;d been watching the same red lights for the last two nights but didn&#39;t say anything because she thought it was just a weather balloon or something we commonly have in our skies here in Arizona. Watching from our backyard in Chandler, Arizona we couldn&#39;t see the triangular shape but we observed the pulsating red &amp; amber lights for ten minutes until they disappeared before our eyes.<n>

Left a thin trail.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was a clear blue sky with no cloud cover.  I observed a shiny liquid mercury like teardrop shaped object in the sky, leaving a small jet stream lasting about 60 seconds. The silver object traveled at a high speed in a southerly direction over the city of Scottsdale. At arms length, it appeared to be the size of a tennis ball. At arms length the jet stream appeared about 6 inches long, straight and thin. There was no sound as it passed in the sky. It looked like a &#34;blob&#34; of the Terminator II from the movie.<n>
11/8/00 12:20|Bellevue|WA|Other|5 minutes|Strange object floating above the Bellevue Mall|12/2/00|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/014/S14866.html|180|ndxe200011| Strange object floating above the Bellevue Mall<n> <n><n> <n><n> On August 30, 2000 at about 12:25pm I noticed an interesting object slowly descending above the Bellevue Mall. From an upper floor in the Rainier Tower, I watched it descend moving slightly north-west over the next few minutes to just above the Bellevue Mall where it held stationary for a couple minutes. I have 8x23 binoculars in my office because of my view, so I was able to watch this object and see it in decent detail. The object looked like a large ballon in the shape of a butterfly, except that the &#34;wings&#34; of the butterfly were not part of the balloon, but attached to the sides. It was symmetrical, with &#34;wings&#34; on either side, and was very colorful, as you would expect a butterfly to be. I thought it was interesting that a balloon would descend from the sky, but I assumed it wasn&#39;t impossible. I was very surprised to see it start ascending, and headed slightly south-east, the same path from which it descended. This seemed strange for a balloon, to descend from high, stop close the the ground, and then begin ascending again. I know the time and date of the event because I took pictures of it with a Mavica digital camera which recorded the date and time. Unfortunately because the object was small and distant the only thing in the pictures is a gray blot. No detail to be seen. I can provide the pictures if necessary, but they really don&#39;t show much. I didn&#39;t think much of it until today (11/08/2000). Again, at about 12:20pm (this time I looked at the clock and did not take pictures) I noticed the same object above the Bellevue Mall. I looked at it through my binoculars and it appeared the same as I remembered the previous object. It descended slowly, heading north-west (note that the prevailing winds in the area are north-east, but it&#39;s a calm day) until it was below my line of sight (high in the Rainier Tower). I called a co-worker over and asked him to look at it. We then went to another office on our floor because we knew of a telescope we could use to image it better. Sadly, it&#39;s a crappy telescope and although I was able to track it for a while it didn&#39;t produce any better picture than the binoculars did. This time, instead of heading back up, it floated just above the tree line out over Medina and moved north slowly in between trees. I eventually lost it just south of NE 8th. I estimate the size to be beachball to basketball size, but it&#39;s hard to guage size from the distance from which I observed both events. Right now I&#39;m watching several different helicopters flying above and around the Medina area. Helicopter traffic isn&#39;t unusual around here, but the timing is interesting to note. I&#39;ve seen three thus far, two look like private, small helicopters and the other a larger news-chopper breed, but too far away to see any markings or color. All three have been flying up and down the east shoreline above Medina.<n>

Gore and I had an argument with my parents. I left the house to cool off outside in the backyard. I was facing north at the time and it was night.

It was closer than any plane I have ever seen and it was dead silent. I felt an intense feeling of bewilderment and even fear. It was nothing like I had ever seen before. My dad then came out of the house but as I was calling for him to come see, the orbs had already &#34;disappeared&#34; behind the rooftops.<n>

Full cloud cover, only small patches of blue.  I was walking on the side walk and thinkng to myself; this is the kind of day you might see a ufo.  At that moment I was kind of scanning the sky almost above my head and just to the right, I was faceing east, and saw a totally white ufo it was just ducking behind a cloud. It was the size of my pinkey nail when held in front of my face as compaird to the ufo. The cloud layer was fairly low. It has been raining for two weeks here. The ufo moved fluidly with stability and no wableing or sound. It was the color of the clouds around it but just a bit more white. I,m sure it was intellagently controlled because of the speed that it was moving, and it seemed to take evasive moves when I saw it and it saw me. I have seen one of thies white cloud ufo&#39;s  before. That one was in Arizona about 4 years ago around Flagstaff. I see ufo&#39;s fairly frequently and I told my self that I would report the next one. Please excuse the spelling I am dislexic.

Small aircraft moving in other direction!<n> <n><n> <n><n> After having gotten out of bed due to some extreme lower back pain I looked out of the window at bedside and started to look at the sky which was filled with stars. The moon had set and as I was looking to the Southwest at Orion I noticed a bright white light just below and to the left (from my perspective) of Orion. At first I thought that it was that bright star in the Constelation next to Orion, but then realized that it was something else, perhaps a planet! I then noticed that it began to move to the Southeast at a very slow rate of speed. I estimate it to have been between 2000 to 3000 feet in altitude and about one to two miles away. It made no sound and as it moved away I moved to the side door and opened it standing on the deck to watch it continue to drift away from the house. While outside I confirmed my own opinion that there was no motorcraft sound at all. The temperature at the time was noted by me to be 32.2 degrees. I do not know how it got to be where it was when I first noticed it without my have having seen it, as the area in my view of  the Southwest sky is not obstructed by any trees and I did not see it move through that portion of the sky as it would have had to do in order to get to the point at which I first sighted it. My conclusion is that it (1) had been at that point motionless for a period of time before I started looking at that sky or (2) suddenly appeared out of thin air! This is not the first time that I have seen such a light in this part of the sky going in the same direction and at about the same slow drifting like speed. About 8 minutes latter a small aircraft which I believe was a Cessna flew over near the same area in the opposite direction. Certainly the pilot of that aircraft had to see this light. I would be interested to know if that pilot reported any unusual airtraffic at that time of the day. Perhaps the host of this site can check with air traffic control in Teterboro or the or the airtraffic controllers at Scranton/Wilkes-Barre both of who have radar looking over this part of Pike County.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Anonymous report.

Movement was barely discernable.  They appeared to be moving slowly to the WNW.  Their direction was erratic, short zig-zag movements both horizontally and vertically (like the etch-a-sketch toy in unskilled hands).  The second one (farther away) dropped below my line of sight, I think.  I watched the first one until it was about at a 45 degree elevation. Then it disappeared, probably into the clouds.  (I couldn&#39;t see any stars.) The second one rose back into view and behaved the same as the first until it too disappeared into the clouds.  Then I scanned the area and spotted another over the city of Reading.  It was quite low and initially blended into the city lights.  It too zig-zagged and climbed into the clouds.  Each object appeared to have at least three light sources.<n>

It made no sound.  It had lights along the leading edge of the triangular shaped wing.  It must have been at least a couple of miles across.  I have heard of this type of craft but I have never seen one until now.

This craft however had no sound and seemed to glide by at least twice the speed of a commercial jet. It was silver and did not have any lights, it reflected light from the city. The power began to come back on as it flew by. This all happened in a span of about 2 minutes. It was headed south in the direction of Ellington Field.<n>

As I was driving on 80 East out of Sacramento, I saw something interesting. I was approaching the Fulton exit, less than a half a mile away, and it was about 2 o’clock in the afternoon. Weather was mostly blue sky, with a heavy wind gusting from left to right. I saw what appeared to be a metallic object with a tail, at about 10 o’clock elevation and about 2 o’clock to my right. It was moving right to left at one hellacious speed, and the tail seemed to flicker. The object was about half of a pencil eraser diameter at arms length, just enough size to make me think it was probably round, and the tail was about 1/2 to 1 hour of arc, trailing behind it. It only was visible for about half a second, and just when it was about to go over the highway, it seemed to disappear. I have no idea how big it was, or how far it was away. I think it was less than 1,000 feet from me, and less than 200 feet in altitude, but I am not sure. If it was farther away than that, it would have had to be really moving! I tried to fit it into some familiar object, and could not. It was not a balloon, because it going against the wind at a high speed. I don’t think it was a stunt kite, because there is no place to fly one in that area, as far as I know, and because it went in a straight line. It did not reverse direction or stop as a kite would have to do. (I fly them myself, and it definitely didn’t move the way a kite does.) Airplane or helicopter, no way. It did not resemble one in either appearance or the way it flew. As for a meteor, I have never seen one in broad daylight, and this object seemed to have more size than that. Also, every meteor I have seen has been going almost straight down, and I have only seen them at a much higher angle of elevation, while looking up, not straight ahead. The nearest thing I can fit it with is a “rod” which I have read about a few times on various web sites, but I am not sure about that either. I don’t think it fits any of the classical descriptions of “flying saucers” or any kind of alien space craft, unless it was moving at a truly incredible speed, or was less than 3 feet in diameter. They usually don’t have tails, as far as I have heard. Don’t know...just a curious thing. If there are aliens, I wish they would fly things around here, it’s kind of boring in Sacramento, most of the time. I never thought I would be sending you one of these things. Contact me only if others reported it. Otherwise why bother? Not a strong sighting.<n>

There were three triangular shaped, silverish-white objects with black bottoms. Each triangle was accompanied by serveral silver spheres. They bobbed slowly and noiselessly descending toward the park, but only close enough to make out the shapes and colors of the objects. We watched as two of the trianles flanked by several of the silver spheres moved to the left of us while the third triangle and its spheres moved around to the right of us. We watched them for approx. 10 minutes before they just disappeared without a trace. They made no noise or smoke. It was a clear day no clouds in the sky about 2 hours before sunset. It was awesome. I contacted the Fort Wayne Police Department,they had not received  any other reports.

I yelled to my friends wife to come look. Then I saw the third light to the south of the first two which were to the direct east of my location at 71st and Peoria. She immediately called the neighbors who ran out to see them also.My friend then pulled up from the store, as did his son from going out.We all stood there and watched as the two hoovered around staying fairly close to each other but separate. Then the 3rd ufo started moving towards the first two. It seemed to be south as far as south mountain when first seen, but moved north to be a mile or so south of the pair in 25-30 seconds. It stayed there while we saw the two orange lights merge into one red &#34;ball&#34; for maybe 45 seconds then separate. Then all three now orange again moved north keeping the distance from the pair to the single 1-2 miles. They also gained a massive amount of altitude, and seemed to be blinking or had clouds or something passing under them. As they all were getting harder to see, the single dissapeared. Next the &#34;follower&#34; in the pair dissapeared and the &#34;leader&#34; broke into two separate yellow or white lights and both of them dissapeared. I wonder what in the heck is going on?<n>

I had my binoculars with me for some evening star gazing. I notice what apperared to be a celestial body about the brightness of Jupiter hanging over the Gulf of Mexico, so I raised my binoculars to look at the apparent planet. My binoculars are Nikon 10x50&#39;s. Once I brought the object into view I realized it was not a planet or star I was looking at. The object when viewed through the binoculars appeared to be two gold/yellow/amber spheres side by side with red flashing lights on the bottom. The object was hovering motionless about 100 feet off of the water. I then passed the binoculars to my girlfriend and she descibed the object to me exactly the way that I saw it. We took turns passing the binoculars back and forth until the object slowly disappeared into the fog/low level clouds. We tried to find the object again for the next hour but it was just too cloudy. The object was silent. I say that because we watched several airplanes in the vacinity and could clearly hear the props.<n>

My wife and I were watching a movie on TV when we saw 3 very bright lights in the southern sky over Phoenix.  The 3 lights were in a triangle pattern, 1 on top and two on the bottom.  The bottom left light went out first for about 10 seconds whle the other two remained on.  Then it came back on.  Then 2 of the lights went out at exactly the same time for about ten seconds and they reappeared.  The the lower left light went out again and did not come back on.  Finally the other two lights went out and they did not reappear. While this was going on we saw a normal size commercial airplane heading for the Phoenix Sky Harbor airport in the distance, but it was very SMALL in size compared to the triangle we witnessed. We saw the 3 lights from the inside of our home and then proceeded into our backyard and stil saw them.<n>

The lights were two rings rotating.  The outside ring, estimate 50 ft.  The inner ring about 15 ft. (Not sure how big as it was high up in the air.  It was above the tree line and there was mist and the lights reflected through.  The lights were white.  Both rings rotated at same speed, not slow but not real fast. Maybe 60rpm.  I looked at it and thought maybe something from the ground shining up but there was nothing from the ground up.  I watched it for a few minutes and it seemed to keep up with us.  I told my husband to pull over but the traffic was to fast to enable us to do so safely.  He looked in the mirror and saw the lights. It seemed to follow for a few seconds then stopped and faded into the high mist.  I could see the aura of it after it faded until we were out of range.  (We turned off the 401 onto a off ramp. at Prescott).   I have absolutely no idea what it could have been.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  The witness has included an illustration, which we will attempt to include here in the near future.

I didn&#39;t recognize the sound but as it moved slowly closer the vibrations became more intense and louder.  Whatever was making the low rumbling was up in the sky above my house. There were no lights that I could see, and the speed of the ufo seemed to be very slow.  I often hear hellicopters and airplanes fly over, but this noise was like no other I have ever heard.  After it passed over my house, causing local dogs to bark, i stood and listened to it creep out to the east.  And about 5 minutes after it passed over me i could still hear and feel the vibrations. But never once did i see any lights.  The whole duration of sound lasted about 15 minutes until it flew over the mountians.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We find this to be a very interesting report, primarily since we have received many such reports from northern California.  It occurs to us that the U. S. military may be flying some type of aircraft that produces a loud rumbling noise, which is detectable at ground level, even when the aircraft is at high altitude.

On the 4th of November just 20 minutes after midnight I was on the deck in back of my house looking south. I saw two objects moving at a fairly slow rate of speed. I would estimate their speed was less than one hundred miles per hour. One of the objects was trailing the other. I could not make out what shape they had. All I could see was two very bright lights on each object. The color of the lights was red in front and a greenish looking light in the rear of each object. They caught my attention because the lights were very large and very bright. I am very familiar with the size of safety navigational lights on aircraft. These lights were very large and much brighter than safety lights on aircraft. Also the lights did not blink, they stayed on all the time and were very bright. The lights were just above the horizon and they were a good di! stance away. (I would estimate between five and ten miles away) At first I saw them traveling in a north-eastern direction and then they turned left and were traveling in a north-western direction when I lost sight of them as they disappeared behind the trees. I only saw them for a short while, approximately ten to fifteen seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was in the Air Force for twelve years and am very familiar with aircraft lights.

I was hunting in the Cheatham County Wildlife Mgt. Agency. I was walking up a footpath/road about 30&#39; wide. I looked up to my right and saw a huge triangular shaped craft passing parallel to my position. I had a pair of 8x30 binoculars and started viewing it with them.  It was flying west and the sun was reflecting on the huge nose area and the leading edge of the wings and the area was smooth and rounded and was sand colored.  The underneath was shaded and grayish colored.  I seen no lights or windows.  It made a very faint jet sound.  It was leaving a very thick contrail.  I lost sight of it as it flew into the sun and the trees got in the way.  I then faced east and could see another one coming on the same flight path but closer to me.  Again I used my binoculars.  As it passed overhead and past me, I go a good look at the rear of the ship.  There was no tail and the rear of the ship looked very complicated.  I could see two rows of engines or exhausts where the very thick contrails was coming from.  There appeared to some kind of housing area around the exhaust areas and I saw a large strobing light on each side of the housing area.  There also appeared to be some type of louvered areas.  The top side of the back of the ship overhung the exhaust area and the bottom of the ship.  It is hard to estimate the altitude as this aircraft was HUGE!! It pretty much filled up my binoculars at times.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Addendum:<n> <n><n> <n><n> I saw two huge triangular aircraft leaving contrails.<n> <n><n> <n><n> this is a report of additional information on an earlier report made 11-20-00. I went back to the location and got a gps location of 36 degrees 09.41 west by 087 degrees 04.43 west at an elevation of approx. 760 feet.  I estimate the craft were flying at approx. 5000 ft with a wing span of approx. 1000 feet.<n>

I happened to glance upward:  at the top center of the windshield, just above the steering wheel, in the western sky, fell a star-like object, in a zig-zag, almost floating fashion, slightly  toward the north.  It was slightly dimmer than what Venus has been recently;  at first I thought it was a meteor - but it seemed more &#34;lightweight&#34;, as an ash or cinder would have fallen.  It was silvery-whitish-blue in color, and didn&#39;t change in color, a bit sparkly, but more like a planet than a star.  If it were to break into the atmosphere and &#34;land&#34;, it would have fallen a few miles beyond west Seattle, into Puget Sound - not as far in distance  as the Pacific Ocean.  If this thing had behaved like a normal meteor, I would never have phoned the UFO Center...I even looked up information, hoping a meteor shower was in progress...but I understand the Taurid meteor showers are not expected until close to 11/09/00.  If an investigator were to call, all I could do in addition to this report would be to trace the object&#39;s pattern from the top of the windshield to its descending northern position as it went beyond the shrubery at the top of the driveway.  Wish I could be of more assistance.  I only hope other callers have reported to you from better vantage points.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Correct time is after midnight, not during midday.

The object was too large to be man made, and moved over the northern valley, from east to west, doing less then 40mph.  I would have to say by my line of site, the disc shaped had to be roughly 1000 feet over the tree line.  It was very brilliant, and also had a blinking white light at the top. I hope you find this e-mail in similarities with many others from the same area and time frame.  If so, I&#39;d like to know if anyone else saw it.  Please contact me.

11/2/00 19:45|Bloomfield|NJ|Disk|3 minutes|Bloomfield, N.J., 7:40pm EST, saucer-shaped craft heading north/northeast coming from the southeast.|12/2/00|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/014/S14993.html|217|ndxe200011| Bloomfield, N.J., 7:40pm EST, saucer-shaped craft heading north/northeast coming from the southeast.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was walking my dog.  I left the house between 7:30 and 7:40pm.  I live within a few miles of Newark International Airport so at any given time there are usually at least 5 or 6 aircraft in the sky.  Astronomy is a hobby of mine so I also know what the planet Venus looks like.  I was walking north, one block west of the entrance to the Garden State Parkway south at Hoover Ave. when I saw a light coming out of the southeast at a very great speed.  The light seemed to be flying at a steep angle.  At first I thought it was going to crash, but as it came closer, I realized that its flight was not on an angle, the craft itself was tilted, at least 45 degrees, but probably closer to 60.  And it was saucer-shaped.  Also, it did not have the lights on it that I usually see on aircraft coming or leaving the airport: it seemed as if the whole craft was one big light.  It was heading  north by northeast and had 2 near collisions with planes coming in for a landing.  It was also extremely loud, much louder than then the planes that normally fly by (and they are QUITE loud!).  In fact, it was the noise which first drew my attention.  )It sure as hell sounded like a plane that was going to crash).  The 2 planes it almost collided with were both coming from the direction of northern New York City, a typical flight pattern for around here.  If they had been cars, I would have said that this craft cut them off.  It was flying quite low, lower than normal for flying parallel to the ground.  As I watched, it seemed to head due north, following the Hudson River.  I felt sure I&#39;d hear about it on the news the next day, since it was a VERY near miss with the other 2 planes.  But there was no mention of the incident.  However, I did tell a friend online that night about my sighting, lest you think I am making this up. I&#39;ve known all along that what I saw was a UFO, but I run a fledgling website covering alternative and paranormal news. I felt that it is too early to have my credibility damaged.  The only reason I am reporting it now is because I read the report from Cresskill and I want the witness to know that they weren&#39;t just seeing things.

I cannot be sure of the size or the distance but if I had to guess it was up about 1000 feet.  It was triangular shaped with each side, I&#39;m guessing, 30 feet.  The &#34;tip&#34; areas of the triangle were not pointy but rounded.  There where large circles in each tip.  There were no lights,it was lit only by the ambient light in the area.  It made no sound whatsoever.  It was traveling rapidly but not super fast.  The circular areas were a carbon color in the low light and the interior area appeared to have a light brownish cast.<n>

In November of last year, I was on my way to pick my wife up from work at Cabella&#39;s. It was a very windy, cold night, not fit for small aircraft to be taking off from our tiny airport, so I guess that&#39;s why I noticed this in the first place. As I was going around towards the back of the building on the access road, I saw what appeared to be a flying canoe go over my Jeep. White bottom, with an alternately blinking white light on the front and rear. As it passed over my windshield from N to S, I rolled down my window for a better look. All I could see was the bottom, and this thing looked like I said- a flying canoe, with the 2 blinking lights. In fact, this thing was so cheezy looking I laughed out loud. It looked like a really piss-poor carnival gimic. The lights looked like 60-watt light bulbs, nothing even remotely resembling modern avionic marker lights- no red or green.And with a strong wind out of the W, this thing was low enough that I could see that it had no wings, and appeared to be unaffected by the wind- no wobbling like small aircraft do with a strong side-wind blowing.  I am a defense contr., and am very familiar with aircraft. This was definitely NOT one of &#39;ours&#39;. I was more amused, than impressed.<n>

That night the sky was totaly clear. So as I was smoking my cigarette, I was looking up at the stars. I noticed one star more than the others.It looked like it was moving.So I told the night supervisor to look.When he got his eye on it, it was moving. At that time It was moving at a good speed. It looked like maybe it could be a shooting star. Until it stopped moving.Then I knew it had to be something else.So I asked the night shift supervisor what he thought it could be. When he started to answer, It started to move again. We were trying to keep an eye on it, But there were trees soon to be in the way.But that didnt matter. It was like someone turned a switch off. It was gone. What it looked like was a star. It was bright with a little flicker. It was the coolest thing I ever saw. Like I said, It looked like a star at first. But then it started to move. Now, I have seen shooting stars before. This was not a shooting star. Ther was no trail behind it. And as far as i know, shooting stars dont just stop.<n>

I live near John Wayne airport and there is always a couple of planes in the sky. I have never seen anything like this before. Not a sound was made by the craft. There was a large plane much higher in the sky, and I beleive a police helicopter close by judging by sound, but was unable to see the helicopter. I live about 2miles from the ocean, and this craft was coming from Newport Beach when I initially saw it. It then veered off towards Seal Beach, which is north from me. My brain was telling me that it was three white birds flying in formation. But when I first saw it I remember an outline, which is why I say translucent. It also was visably &#34;banking&#34; when it turned north, meaning the right light appeared to raise slightly. That was it.<n>

While driving to work today, I observed something I was unable to identify.  I was westbound on Hwy. 50, approximately 8-10 miles from Sedalia.  This would be the vicinity of Smithton, MO.  I noticed a shape in the sky ahead of me.  Clouds had just moved into the area and it had sprinkled rain.  The shape was over an open field to the South of the highway by approximately 100 feet.  I noticed a grey shape just a little darker than the clouds and no movement to it.  It appeared to hover.  I was driving at or about the speed limit of 60 m.p.h. and observed the object for a total of possibly 15 seconds.  The color wasn&#39;t a shiny metallic, but seemed to be shades of white and grey.  The shape of the object was that of a &#39;Y&#39;.  There was a fuselage and a wing coming off each (back?) side in the slanted position.  I saw no propellors, rotors, or &#39;engine&#39; type parts.  It seemed to be somewhat larger than an ultralite, about the size of a small plane.  The object appeared to hover, as I could detect no movement. This area is approximately 15 miles WSW of Whitman Air Force Base in Knob Noster, MO. A co-worker who drives in from the West told me he saw a black helicopter hovering just before he got to work. Our work place is roughly halfway between my sighting area and the AFB.  There is also an airport for small aircraft in the area. This was not any airplane I have ever seen (and I have seen many of all types).<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We are grateful for the report.  We wonder whether the witness may have observed a type of experimental aircraft known as a VariEasy, or a VariViggen, designed by Burt Rutan.  They are very unusual in appearance, particularly to someone who has never seen one.  PD))<n>

I was confused by this. I walked to the window wondering what was going on. I looked out and saw a large egg shaped craft. The craft was about  500 ft away and 100 ft in the air. The craft  was glowing yellow the light filled my living room. The craft then moved left slowly and turned an dark orange and stoped.The craft hovered again for about 15 sec.The craft moved upward and to the right and now glowed a very light blue.The craft  now was about 500 ft away and 150 ft in the air. The Craft moved away to about 600 ft away and then sped away at incredable speed straight up in the air and disapeared. I thought that the craft was a helicopter and went to bed. After i thaught about what i had seen i realized that a helicopter couldnt move that way and that a helicopter would have made noise which the craft  had not and a helicopter has only one color. The next day i went to the site where i had seen this craft and found a large area of dryed grass.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

The craft was shaped like a saucer. The lights on the object initially caught my eye. There were 10 to 20 lights in rows across the middle of the saucer. They were fairly dim and slowly changing in color. The colors were light green, light brown, light orange, and yellow. I immediatly knew that it was something that I&#39;d never seen before. The speed in which it moved was very deceiving. It slowly moved higher in the sky in front of me and just when it was almost out of sight, I witnessed a solid ray of light shoot from the object up in to the sky an connect to a brightly glowing object that was fixed in the sky. Then the object seemed to follow the ray of light up closer to the bright light and finally disappeared. When it was gone, to my surprise, the bright light remained because it was what appeared to be a star.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>
