12/31/12 23:59|West Sacramento|CA|Fireball|25-30 minutes|30-35 Orange bright lights fly silently in line across Sacramento sky and disappear in same place - New Years Eve|2/4/13|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/095/S95762.html|1|ndxe201212| 30-35 Orange bright lights fly silently in line across Sacramento sky and disappear in same place - New Years Eve<n> <n><n> <n><n> On New Year’s Eve my husband and I, and our friend were traveling home to West Sacramento from Old Sacramento (a touristy area in downtown Sacramento). We were planning on watching the midnight fireworks but there was a shooting and they were cancelled. It was perfectly midnight when we had just crossed over a metal bridge into Southport where we live. I spotted a group of bright orangish lights (my husband says a warm orange-yellow). They were traveling from the southeast to the northwest. It became clear right away that they were not moving like any airplane or helicopter we had seen before. I asked my husband to pull off onto a side road. We got out of the car and watched as about 4-5 crossed above us.  When they got just past us overhead they would disappear. Then another three came from the south.  They disappeared in the same place. Unlike the ones we saw later, these first ones appeared to be in a vertical line (not straight though) Almost like the  bot! tom ones were connected to the top ones and hanging there. Picture an old fashioned mobile. As the others joined them the line became horizontal.  The lights were luminous. As they all disappeared we got back into the car.  We were discussing what we saw and agreed they emitted no sound. There were no blinking lights, just a continuous glow.  We turned back onto the main road and went up a couple streets to the entrance to our neighborhood.  We got about 3 blocks into our neighborhood and saw a new group of them coming.  They were in a straight line, moving relatively slowly but not maintaining any static speed.  Some appeared to stop momentarily as another would pass it up.  They would all reach a point in the sky just south of Downtown Sacramento and just disappear.  When they were all gone we got back in the car and drove another 3 blocks to our home.  As soon as we got in I ran upstairs to the master bedroom which looks south. I opened the curtains and found a whole new bunch.  There were a lot of them.  We watched for 10-15 minutes. They w! ere in a long line. They all disappeared in the same spot.  To me it looked like they veered to the east and disappeared (maybe their light then focused in an easterly direction making it look invisible us) but my husband and friend disagreed and said they went up. Hmmm.  My friend got on the phone with 911 as we were watching but they thought we were nuts (thought we were seeing fireworks). I was so frightened by this that I could not sleep for hours. Let me add that the light from these things did not seem to come from one point; it seemed to emanate from the whole object. We are on the flight path of Sacramento Intl. Airport for Southwest Airlines from L.A. We also can see flights take-off from Sacramento’s Executive Airport. We are well aware of what planes look like and how they travel. We can safely say that the point south from where they became visible to us is at least 10 miles away, probably closer to 15. I have just learned there are such things as Chinese Sky Lanterns. I ! have never seen these but I would have to say that these lights were very large. Very much larger than any light from an airplane!! They also traveled a great distance for a floating candle light and also they all disappeared at exactly the same place. We all agreed that they were about 1000-2000 feet up. So, tell me, what do you think? We three are convinced we watched UFO’s that were being intelligently and purposefully controlled. We are all very educated. My husband is a college professor, I am an environmental scientist at Cal/EPA, our friend has a BA and is an educator. Before New Year’s Eve we had never heard of these orange-red-yellow things. We have since learned they are being seen by many.  Thank you for listening.<n>

Approximately at 11:58 pm we witnesses a strange bright cube shape slowly hovering with a centre of fire in the air.  We were facing east and the flaming cube with four points was approximately half the size of a full moon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After just being there for about a minute it simply just faded to black.<n>
12/31/12 23:58|Palouse|WA|Light|~1 minute|At New Years, I observed two orange-red colored lights moving inline before turning straight upwards and disappearing into the clouds.|2/4/13|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/095/S95743.html|3|ndxe201212| At New Years, I observed two orange-red colored lights moving inline before turning straight upwards and disappearing into the clouds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Shortly before the New Year to a few minutes after, I was preparing some fireworks outside to welcome in the New Year.  I had returned inside to get something.  When I went back out, I glanced to the northwest and saw two orange-red colored lights.  They were moving inline, with one light following behind the other, and heading almost directly over our small town.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The weather was cold and foggy, but the fog had lifted to a low cloud ceiling.  The lights were traveling in a west to east direction, and were beneath the clouds.  They were moving steadily and I noticed were completely silent, no sound at all.  These were clearly not aircraft lights, and were larger than aircraft lights would appear at that distance.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When the lights were almost directly overhead, the lead light appeared to turn and go straight up until it disappeared into the clouds.  The second light followed just past where the first light went upward into the clouds.  It seemed to stop, and backtrack slightly, before it too went straight up into the clouds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I checked the weather recorded at the Pullman/Moscow Airport  15 miles to the south, and they were recording an 1800 ft cloud ceiling.  Given similar conditions, I would estimate these lights when I first saw them were traveling around 1500 to 1800 ft above my location.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I do not know what these were, but I am almost certain these were not airplanes, helicopters, fireworks or meteors. Due to them flying almost directly over our small town and their low altitude, I had the feeling of possible observation?<n>

My first thought it was a plane coming in for landing but it’s color was different (flesh-orange color)  It was brighter than a typical aircraft and it was following the same traffic pattern as a plane landing from the East.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It stayed at the same pace coming straight across the sky.  I watched it for about 20 seconds before it went over my condo.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I ran out the back door to see if it was a plane that was landing, but it had gotten smaller as it was ascending into the clouds very fast, like vertically and there was no noise (it was a crisp cold night with a high scattered cloud cover)  It remained the same color and was bright all around it, not just lights in front and a tail light like an airplane.  It had lights all around it!<n> <n><n> <n><n> I yelled at my boyfriend that was in the bathroom to please come and see this!   He stammered out to the back deck when he did, it was ascending fast up into the high cloud cover.  I asked him did you think that was odd or what?  He agreed but wasn’t as astonished as me as he mostly got a glimpse.  Later I asked him what he thought and he said all he really saw was the orangey color and said he thought that was odd how it disappeared quickly.<n>
12/31/12 23:54|Hollywood|CA|Fireball|5 minutes|6 Beautiful red orb geometric formation fleet hovering over the Hollywood hills.  Los Angeles, CA.|2/4/13|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/095/S95703.html|5|ndxe201212| 6 Beautiful red orb geometric formation fleet hovering over the Hollywood hills.  Los Angeles, CA.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Los Angeles, Hollywood hills, New Years Eve 2012.  I was with 5 friends at a new years eve party overlooking the Hollywood sign.  Standing outside around 11:30 pm, my friends and I along with about 5 random others watched a red orb make its way up the mountain by the Hollywood sign.  It struck us as odd as there was no way a car or anything like that can gain access to the hills especially around the sign, so we all watched the Orb light trying to figure out what it was.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After the orb moved up to the top of the mountain it just kept going up over the mountain, now hovering.  The light was a bright orangey red, however it was changing between a duller red and even white sometimes.  We all watched until the the orb finally dissintergrated into nothing.  Everyone was convinced this orb was &amp;quot;not of this planet&amp;quot;.  We were speechless, and excited.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After this, my 3 friends and I left the party right before the ball dropped at midnight.  We left the house, and drove up around the block (headed in the direction to where we saw the initial orb).  Still overwhelmed and excited about the first orb, as we turned the corner, I looked to my right and saw 6 more!  In a perfect geometric formation hovering directly over us on the street.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We pulled over in awe, and couldn&#39;t quite comprehend what was happening except we now knew, for sure, this was other-worldy.  We watched for a good five minutes as the orbs changed patterns and colors, so bright, so vivid and so realistic, there was no explaination other than UFO something or other.  One by one, the orbs dissintergrated within the formation until they were all gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> IT was one of the most fantastic, beautiful, eerie and wonderful things any of us had ever seen.  It wasn&#39;t scary or threatening, more peaceful and knowing.  It was definetely the greatest nye i&#39;ve ever experienced. I even walked away with an amazing photograph!<n>

I noticed an very unusual light above the flight path of landing planes at Dulles International Airport.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As i grab my camera and start to record, 33sec&#39;s in another light appears out of nowhere. After about 2 minutes, 6 more craft came from beyond the building across the street and flew over top of my home.  2 of them changed course and 1 of the 2 stopped and hovered for several minutes before getting back in formation and flying off.  They flew over my building to where i could no longer record.  They did not appear to ascend but to continue W SW toward Washington DC.  I have 7-8 minutes of video.  The video is rather large i will email if i can.<n>

I and 2 others witness the unexplainable sight.  I referenced the appearence to be &#34;jellyfish&#34; like, but amber in color, with whiteish strings in the center area .<n> <n><n> <n><n> Also,it was odd that when trying to look at or focus on the &#34;ufo&#34; my eyes felt like they were going crosseyed.  Lastly, the 3 of us (working at restaurant) all agreed that we had never seen ANY thing like this,  EVER!<n>

A few minutes later a single or.  Appeared following the triangle-shaped orbs.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My job&#39;s property wouldn&#39;t allow me to go further than a block, but as I continued following the single red orb with my eyes, another single appeared. and that was followed by another; they were all traveling across Savannah towards South Carolina.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Later, that night, about 1:40am., while I was escorting the nurse, we both saw four red orbs traveling fro  South Carolina side of the river.  I managed to video one of the orbs with my cell.  I would have videoed more but I just assumed that someone was just releasing lanterns or playing a prank<n> <n><n> <n><n> I thought I might have captured something when I went on the internet and saw so many reports of the same thing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> How could I have seen the same thing as others from around the country?<n>

It was red-orange and flickering.  It seemed to me more like a flame than steady flashing lights of a plane.  It also seemed higher than a plane.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The path of the object went nearly over head and curved to the north or north west and the orange light went out.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The velocity seemed steady like a satellite but I cannot explain the flickering flame-like light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I could still see the object dimly as grey or dark silver until it disappeared behind trees.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

THEN VANISHED!<n> <n><n> <n><n> ON NEW YEARS EVE I WALK INTO MY BACK YARD AT 23:32,  AS IT SOUNDED LIKE A WAR ZONE. I SAW FIRE WORKS IN THE NIGHT SKY. THE SHY WAS PARTLY CLOUDY TOWARDS THE SOUTH SKY AND CLEAR TOWARDS THE NORTH SKY. TOWARDS THE SOUTH SKY I NOTICE A RED LIGHT TRAVELING FROM SOUTH TO NORTH ACROSS THE SKY. AT FIRST I THOUGHT IT WAS JUST A FIRE WORK GETTING READY TO EXPLODE, AS ALL THE OTHERS DID. HOWEVER, AS I KEPT MY SIGHT ON THE RED LIGHT, IT DID NOT EXPLODE. INSTEAD THE LIGHT TRAVELED SLOWLY ACROSS THE NIGHT SKY. AS IT FLEW CLOSER I SAW A CRAFT WITH THREE RED LIGHTS THAT WERE NOT FLASHING. AS IT TRAVELED JUST BELOW CLOUD LEVEL, THE LIGHTS LITE UP THE CLOUD ABOVE IT WITH A RED GLOW. I RAN IN THE OFFICE TO GRAB MY BINOCULARS (8X42). WITHIN 30 SECONDS I RETURNED TO MY BACK YARD, THE CRAFT WAS STILL FLYING SLOWLY ACROSS THE SKY AND WAS STILL UNDER THE CLOUD. SO I STARTED VEIWING IT WITH MY BINOCULARS AND CLEARLY SAW THREE RED LIGHTS, ONE ON THE TOP CENTER, AND ONE ON FRONT AND B! ACK. THE CRAFT APPEARED TO HAVE A GRAY METAL COLOR. ONCE IT WAS NO LONGER UNDER THE CLOUD THE SKY BACKGROUND WAS A CLEAR STAR LITE SKY. THE CRAFT LOOKED TO BE ABOUT 1000 FEET UP IN THE AIR AS IT TRAVELED NORTH A SHORT DISTANCE THEN CAME TO A COMPLETE STOP. THERE WAS NOT ANY NOISE COMING FROM THE CRAFT. IT STOPPED IN MID AIR FOR ABOUT 20 SECONDS. THEN THE CRAFT TOOK OFF FLYING FROM A DEAD STOP, TO A VERY HIGH RATE OF SPEED AT ABOUT A 45 DEGREE ANGLE TOWARD THE NORTHWEST SKY DIRECTION. THE CRAFT TRAVELED SO FAST THAT IT&#39;S RED LIGHTS VANISHED INTO THE STAR LITE SKY IN UNDER 10 SECONDS.<n>

It suddenly stopped near the tree line in our back yard and then started pulsating.  I watched it for about 5 minutes.  The object then looked like it was about to move forward, in the direction of our house when it suddenly went into reverse.  I immediately got up to get my roommate to witness this strange light in the sky but when she got there, the object was gone.<n>

Not soon after looking around I noticed a redish/orange orb/sphere appeared in the sky coming in from my South and heading over the treeline of my neighbor&#39;s home across the street heading into a dark cloud bank to my North.  Right after seeing the first organe/red orb a second appeared coming from the same direction and passing over my house and heading into the Northern cloud bank the first orb had gone into.  Both orbs were the same redish orange color and did not change color or make any noise as they passed overhead.  I would think that both were the size of my kitchen area, 12&#39;x12&#39;.  Within just a few minutes another two orbs exactly the same as the first two came into my site and followed the same flight path as first described.  For the next 30 to 45 minutes I witnessed at least 16 to 20 of these redish orange orbs/sphere shape! d objects float over my house and the neighbor&#39;s across the street in sets of 2 every 3 to 5 minutes and disappear into a cloud bank to my North.  None of the orbs changed color or shape or were different in appearance from any of the others and none of them made any noise at all.  No one was outside at all on my small block area to witness what I saw and I have never seen any orbs prior to that date nor since.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

At first glance I thought why is this plane so red, then I notice that it began slowing down in way that seemed odd for a normal plane in flight across the sky and as the  blazing red plane became closer to view I saw a second plane coming clearer into view and then first plane began ascending higher into the sky.  I said to myself that it must be a helicopter until it became going further up into the sky than I had ever seen a helicopter ascend.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I saw a neighborhood acquaintance that is in a wheel chair approaching and I called out to him to look up at what was happening.<n> <n><n> <n><n> While we were watching the first plane ascend so high that it look like a red dot the second plane was moving up higher while moving in the direction of San Francisco it was at that time we could see a third plane approaching as if was on fire then all three were gone from view I was back into my apartment and the time was 11:50.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am so glad that I did not have that experience alone the two young men that so were also amazed at what we had just experienced.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had planed to visit with my friend and bring in the New Year with friends but I felt to hot inside and decide that I would return home after visiting only 10 minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I cannot stress enough how glad I am that I had two people around me to witness this incredible sighting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> You have any questions please contact me.<n>

Four amber colored lights moved from north to south, about 30 degrees off the horizon, along the eastern end of Balboa Park, near the golf driving range.   We observed these lights for approximately a minute and a half.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They appeared to increase in altitude, have a slight flicker and then either they went out or went behind a cloud.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We surmised they might be Chinese Lanterns, similar to the El Cajon lights seen almost like clockwork on every New Year&#39;s Eve.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There were three adults (over 40) and one child (Over 5) in the car and all witnessed this event.<n>

No sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 10:40/10:42 PM approximately.   Watched a red light in the sky moving from north to east in the horizon.  Looked for awhile to determine if it was a plane/firework, it moved very slowly, slowed down, gained speed, slowed down again until it disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then, ANOTHER one appeared from approximately the same starting point as this first one, and it was the same colored red fireball like light, brighter than an airplane, but not much bigger.  A brilliant red light which glowed.  It proceeded the same way, and then a second one appeared (this would be a total of three at this point, with the first one disappeared.)<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then the second red light disappeared, and I watched the other one proceed.  It seemed to just slowly meander, slow down a bit, then pick up speed again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> And a fourth appeared just after the third disappeared, again from roughly the same place as the original one. I watched it move about and then it also disappeared. There were some clouds in the night sky, no stars were visible.<n> <n><n> <n><n> These brilliant red glowing fireballs or lights could not have been meteors, they moved way too slow, and their motion was not that of an airplane, they seemed to weave back and forth a bit, as if they could go in any direction they choosed, they were a strange red color that I would not associate with a red airplane light, and they &#39;appeared&#39; and disappeared slowly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This couldn&#39;t have been a plane going in circles, unless planes can teleport themselves these days... nor helecopters, there was no sound.<n>

The person that filmed this said they saw 2 crafts only one was caught on tape.  When he first started filming he walks away to go get his wife, then films the craft a second time.  Craft seemed to be hovering.  Not sure if experts can tell if it is really a UFO or not.  He said this craft went straight up then was gone.  I will give my name as contact info.  Not sure if he wants to be known.  I would like to know if this is real or if anyone can even tell if it is real or fake.  I have the video posted on my facebook.

The object did not seem to be moving,  I pointed it out to my girlfriend and roommate whom were both in the car and they stated it was just a plane.  I disagreed and told them to look at it, I told them that it was orange and I have never seen a plane that looks like that. I then stated it did not seem to be moving,  they then wondered what it was as well. My roommate then noticed about a minute after the initial sighting that it just completely disappeared; we looked all over and could not see it at all in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About a minute later as we got closer to downtown Boise I then noticed five orange fireball objects in the sky, I thought maybe it was just lights from downtown then I noticed it was far too high in the air and the objects were in a zigzagged line going up.  These seemed to be slightly moving then all but one disappeared, about ten seconds later the last one disappeared as well.  I thought maybe the buildings could have been blocking my view but after we passed them there was nothing there.  The sky was clear with no clouds at all in that area.  I have no idea what these were but they were not planes and were far too high in the sky to be any type of lights.  They had me pretty creeped out, and I cannot seem to explain how we seen these objects twice and one was kind of far away from the other sighting.<n>

I saw an orange fireball that reminded me of a hot air balloon but with no balloon.  It was very small, but still noticeable.  I was driving home from work on New Year&#39;s Eve and saw this on Highway 94 West.  I kept staring at it saying what is it?  I was thinking, it has to be a UFO.  Then, I heard tonight on Coast to Coast AM that other people have been seeing the same thing and that confirmed my sighting.  I can&#39;t believe the government is keeping quiet about UFO&#39;s.  We all know they exist.  I am glad I was listening to the show and that is what prompted me to write in.  I have also seen a blue light streak across the sky as I was driving in Kansas about a couple of years ago.  I heard more people are seeing blue light UFO&#39;s that look like a streak of light.  I didn&#39;t say anything to an! yone and thought I may have been a little crazy.  The more I thought about it I was like maybe it is a UFO.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I estimated them to be 1/4 -1/2 mile from the ground.  From my perspective, taking into account that they were about 300 yards from where I was standing, they looked to be about 18 inches tall, so up close they would have been pretty good sized.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They appeared to be playing, moving in random directions.  The one in the lead would stop and go back toward the second light which would move sideways.  It reminded me of a slow game of tag.  The first would stop then move ahead of the second light again.  They also moved in a slight crescent pattern at times.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After a few minutes, they ascended at a fair rate of speed, both following the same path.  It took 1-2 minutes for them to be too small to be seen through the camera lens but they could still be seen with the naked eye.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Within 30 seconds of them being too high to catch on camera, a bright yellow teardrop came from the same direction and followed the same path the red ones had taken into the sky.  As the yellow light began to ascend, a fourth teardrop, also bright yellow, appeared following the same path as the first three.  They were completely silent and all four lights went directly towards Saiph Kappa, part of the Orion constellation.  None deviated from this path.<n>

The Sun rises to the right and south of where the position of this Web Cam is located so what I was seeing was not the Sun moving and descending towards the city   I noticed from the right of view a very large yellow gold Sphere come from the Black Sea moving slowly down towards the city.  I grabbed my digital camera and managed to take 6 pictures off my monitor before this Glowing Sphere descended behind this large circular building . The total time in view was a least 1 minute .I have pictures that I can post showing the size of this sphere and movement behind this large building .<n> <n><n> <n><n> At 10pm California time I was listening to “Coast to Coast Am” and I was surprised to hear that there were as many as 200 UFO sightings around the United States with-in the same time of my Romania sighting describing the same type of Glowing Ball Sphere .. I think this is a very significant sighting especially because all were at near the same time and of same description of what I saw on this Web Cam  in Constanta Romania .<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am very familiar with this particular area in Constanta Romania and there are several large lakes where this Sphere could have landed and submerged itself.  I have friends in Constanta looking for news reports about this large object.  I spent 2 months in this area living on the beach and I know many people were walking their dogs or jogging at this time and someone must have seen what I had seen .<n> <n><n> <n><n> Last Summer I had dinner near the sea in Constanta and observed a glowing sphere about the size of a small car with multi colors in phasing mode  slowly moving up and away from the shore. I alerted others sitting around me and they all saw the same thing as it seemed to disappear into thin air as it got some altitude.  The manager of the restaurant told me that for hundreds of years in this particular area Spheres of lights have always been seen off shore from the Black Sea and the Sailors consider them friends.<n>

Neither had alcoholic drinks with dinner and neither are drug users.  There were children in the streets firing fire-crackers; as such a neighborhood security guard was parked near their house (third observer).<n> <n><n> <n><n> After greeting the security guard the primary observer noted two bright objects in the sky generally south of his location (round, orange lights, approximately 120 degrees from his location at approximately 300 feet above ground level).  The primary observer initially assumed these were fire crackers that were about to explode; they did not explode.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The primary and secondary observers moved off the paved road down a lake bank to obtain a better view.  The objects proceeded from their southerly location along a route of flight that was generally north at approximately 500 feet above ground level; approximately 1/4 mile from the primary observer.<n> <n><n> <n><n> All observers witnessed these round, orange objects in maneuvering flight and specifically noted that while fairly close in formation (50-100 feet separation) they were not connected by any visible structure. The orange objects were approximate size of a helicopter fuselage, bathed in orange light that is best characterized as appearing similar to molten glass or metal; with shifting degrees of brightness.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There were no anti-collision lights and absolutely no sound.  A third object trailed the first two by approximately 1/2 mile and then a fourth object traversed the same route; approximately 1/2 behind the! third.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The objects were moving at approximately 70-90 knots and took approximately 2 minutes to traverse from initial sighting (south horizon) to extent of viewing over a tree line to the north (probably four miles total).  All observers watched the objects proceed north until they were no longer visible.  They remained on the same courseline and altitude.<n> <n><n> <n><n> During the sighting the primary observer noted a twin engine plan on left base to final for landing at Sanford Airport ... approximately four miles to the northeast.  The reported lights and the airplane were well separated and it is likely that the airplane would not have seen the lights (blending with ground lights).<n> <n><n> <n><n> After the sighting the primary and secondary observers walked back up the lake bank and discussed with the 3rd observer the inexplicable nature of what they had all witnessed.

I had just turned left onto Cleveland Ave. off of South Road when I saw a bright ball of orange light flying towards me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It appeared to be at about 500 feet and moving at about the speed of a small aircraft in the approach pattern, that is about 120 MPH.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The threshold of Runway 05 at Page Field is just a hundred yards or so northeast of the intersection of South Road and Cleveland Ave.  My first thought was that this object was a small plane on fire trying to make the runway, although its current position and direction of travel would have made Runway 31 a better choice for an emergency landing, especially since there was no wind.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I watched this orange light, I realized that it was not an aircraft.  There were no navigation lights, no landing light, and no anti-collision strobe.  It made absolutely no sound.  It was certainly close enough that I should have been able to discern wings, fuselage, and tai! l, had there been any, but it seemed to have no physical structure to it.   It was simply a ball of orange fire.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I could see variations in intensity on its surface and small flames shooting out from it in all directions, and at times I thought I could see some white smoke trailing from it, but very little.  It did not leave a trail.  The fireball was moving in a straight line, from southeast to northwest, and holding altitude.  I turned right off of Cleveland Ave and into a darkened parking lot on Maple Drive and got out of my car for a better look.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This part of town is well lit by orange street lights and single story buildings, but this is a commercial area and almost every store was closed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There are no high structures in this part of town because of the airport.  There were no pedestrians around, but there was still considerable vehicle traffic on Cleveland Ave.  The weather was clear and warm, and there were no clouds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I still had a good view of the fireball as it! passed overhead just a little to the south of my position and! continu ed flying to the northwest, making no changes in altitude, speed or direction of travel.  When I first saw it over Cleveland Ave., it appeared to be about the size of the full moon in the sky, but the moon had not yet come up.   There were no aircraft nearby, and so I had nothing to compare it to for an accurate estimate of its size.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It continued on its course, getting steadily smaller as it became more distant from me.  I watched it until it became nothing more than a pinpoint of bright orange light in the distance.  I estimate that it did not fade from my view until it was well past the Caloosahatchee River and over North Fort Myers, or perhaps even out over the Gulf of Mexico.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I do not know if anyone else saw it or not.   Page Field is a very active general aviation airport, lighted all night, with a control tower.  I don’t know if the Page Field control tower is manned all night, but if it is the air traffic controller must have also seen this fireball.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Also, the control tower at Southwest Florida International Airport should have seen it as it passed a short distance south of their Runway 06, but given the FAA attitude towards reporting any unidentified airborne anomalies, I doubt that anyone in either tower would have said anything.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Given the heavy use of fireworks by the local population in this area to celebrate holidays, it could have been mistaken for an aerial fireworks display, if someone were to take only a quick glance and not watch it for a while.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am a pilot, and can with certainty state that it was definitely not a firework, nor was it a flare, balloon, meteor, comet or any type of known manmade aircraft with which I am familiar.<n>

I was seated facing west and looked up to the sky and noticed a bright orange/red circle of light.  Immediately I stood up and said, &#34;Hey, what is that?&#34;<n> <n><n> <n><n> There were no navigation lights visible, no strobe flashing and was very close to Luke air force base which is about 6 miles west of our location.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It appeared to cut to the south briefly then north all while moving east directly towards us.  No sound could be heard and it stayed a constant glow.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Just short of being directly overhead of us it stopped and hovered for about 5 seconds then turned into an incredibly bright white light, and shot straight up and appeared to be a star in a matter of a split second then faded out of sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was too high to begin with to be any type of fireworks not to mention traveling horizontally for too great a distance. this was not any type of Aircraft that we are familiar with.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Later that same evening, it was witnessed again by 2 other friends and was described exactly the same, as turning into a star.<n>

They were spaced out and moving towards the west.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was light cloud cover last night and they slowly started disappearing into the clouds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I dont know if this was something burning up in the atmosphere but I did not see any dust trails only the orange balls of light.<n>

I was looking to the south west and noticed a very orange, like fire, round object moving slowly south, at a speed similar to a satellite.  Then a much bigger one rose up as if from the ground.  I thought at first it might be a firework as it is New Years eve.It looked exactly like it was something burning.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At that point the first one disappeared.  The bigger one looked as if it was coming closer to me but then began to move south the same as the first one,and slowly got smaller as it went until it also disappeared.I went in to tell my family, and then went back outside to look again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Before I knew it, within seconds, I saw another one!  This one was to the south east, and was moving toward the west. It moved at the same rate as the other two.  I watched it for about 2 minutes.  It seemed to suddenly move south and also disappeared.  I am excited by this event and keep going outside to scan the star filled sky every 10 minutes or so, to! see if I can see more.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I would stay out looking up except it is really cold out.Did anyone else see these?<n>

Several of us noticed one orange colored sphere that we assumed was an errant firework.  A few minutes later we noticed another sphere of the same color moving at the same speed and direction as the previous.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We continued monitoring the sphere, and tracked it traveling due north where it either disappeared or faded into the sky.  At the time the moon was very low on the horizon and this was a rural area so it was very dark, without much light pollution, these objects were easy to follow.<n> <n><n> <n><n> These orange spheres continued showing up for the next ten minutes, coming from due south or south southeast and traveling due north.  Usually the objects appeared in pairs, one object coming from due south, the other south southeast.  They appeared to be moving very fast.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The objects were completely orange in color and had no noticeable navigation lights that would be expected of aircraft.  There were however, several aircraft in the area with navigation lights.  The orange spheres appeared to be lower in the sky than the other observable aircraft, but made no noise.  The objects left no vapor trail.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We noticed a total of ten of these spheres before they stopped showing up.  I do not know if there may have been more in the sky before we noticed them.  Additionally myself and one other person noticed a very quick and faint white flash occurring shortly after each sphere disappeared into the skies to the north.  However, several others did not notice this.<n>

It was moving slowly in a straight line, coming from the south to the north, about the height of a low flying helicopter, but with no sound.  A second identical flickering orange ball then appeared and followed in the same path, moving from the south to north.  Both followed the same line and stayed at the same altitude, and then turned towards the west.  The first slowly faded away and then the second one followed.  The objects were orange, circular in shape, with a flickering type of light, very bright orange.<n>

Never made a sound of any kind during the sighting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My first thought was hey look someone set off some fireworks, kinda early in the evening for that.  I had innitial thought firework due to the altitude of the object not being very high from the ground.<n> <n><n> <n><n> But my wife had noticed that this wasn&#39;t a fireworks rocket because in was gaining altitude and speed as it crossed the sky directly over head from West to East.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I then noticed its speed was quiet fast as it traveled just to where it was going to be obscured by trees.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It stopped changed from a bright Orange flame color to white flame and shot straight up in the air and vanished<n>

My boyfriend and I are star gazers and enjoy the night sky.  I was in the house when suddenly he burst inside and yelled for me to come quick, I had to see something in the sky.  I stepped outside at 8:04 p.m. to view the night sky, which is very clear and filled with stars.  I looked up to where he was pointing and much to my surprise there were three fire ball orange/red blobs NOT STARS sitting spread out in a row just hovering above.  We watched for about two minutes as they just sat there.  From our home you can see planes flying in to Fort Myers Airport.  A plane was coming underneath and these things just sat there.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After about a minute, one started to move and go North as if it were going to the ocean, soon after the other two moved in same direction following the first.  We stood and watched till we could not see them anymore.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were quite amazed with this sighting.  Definitely not stars, shooting stars, falling stars or any type of normal aircraft.  Tried to take picture with iphone but only shows image as white dots.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Let me tell you I will be watching for these visitors to return on any given night...I have read alot of UFO sightings for Florida since I have been living here as of July, 2012.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I came here from Northern California, Redwoods and Sonoma coast.  I have spent many evenings watching satellites cross the skies there and this was NOTHING as I have EVER seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ???<n>

There were no noises during the event, and from my perspective, the light looked low as the current cloud elevation is 5000 to 6000 feet.  There seemed to be a very small light near the bigger light very briefly...<n>

We noticed that it glared so we assumed it was an airplane.  But, we came to the conclusion it couldn&#39;t be an airplane because there was no noise and the speed was just too slow for anything we could think of to stay in the air that high up.  So i grabbed the camcorder (a Full HD Insignia 1920x1080p hand-held)and tried to get a good shot of it. But when i did, we really were clueless as to what this thing was.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object was round in shape.  Viewable only by camera.  It had multiple colors ( green, blue, yellow etc...) emitted from within its shape, that could be seen only during active zoom.  It started to change shape, from top to bottom.  Then, when it came to about half a sphere, a purplish light emitted from the center to about where the top of the original sphere would have been.  As this was taking place, the sphere started to reform.  Once this was complete, it started to continue flashing colors.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I will email the video from ((e-address deleted)).

I immediately pulled the car over into a parking lot, and we proceeded to observe a somewhat amber-orange light, hovering in the northeast sky.  It seemed to be about 2-4 miles away, and had no flashing I’d lights.  It was moving very slow, and actually stopped, and hovered for a few seconds.  There were no clouds or overcast in the area, and many stars were visible in the background.  It also appeared to have a square look to it.  After about a minute and a half, the light dimmed fairly fast into the night  and disappeared.  Around 10pm later that night, we witnessed the same amber light, in the same area hovering again.  Although it disappeared really fast this time.  I managed to record 90 seconds of this light on my iphone.

I walked outside of the station.  The night was cold with some clouds, but clearing.  Three light were high in sky flying north one behind the other about mile.  The lights were white light with a red light in the center.  They were a little brighter than an aircraft that high in the sky, and moving about the same speed as an aircraft that high. (Over 10,000ft.) I noticed two more of the same, but out to the west, like out over the ocean.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A co-worker pulled into the station, I pointed out the lights to him.

I saw on your website that there have been numerous reportings of these &amp;quot;fireballs&amp;quot; and that you were still trying to solve the mystery so thought this might be helpful.<n>

We all saw it.  The craft was motionless against a completely clear night sky.  The object didn&#39;t appear to be very high in the sky since we could observe it through the front windshield of our SUV.  The craft/object then made an impossibly sharp turn and split into four horizontal blue orbs.  The intensity of the brilliant blue light never changed and the four objects reformed into one sphere, hovered for a few seconds and then shot straight down behind the mountains.  The orb had no visible contrail or exhaust; just a solid brilliant blue orb.  We were traveling west on Main Street in Red River.  The object was slightly to the right of the nose of our SUV.  Sawmill Mountain is in the general direction that the craft was observed.  I cannot hazard a guess to the size or distance of the blue orb.  There was no sound.  I have never witnessed anything like ! this before and it unnerved us all.  Hoping others witnessed this as well.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Flat shoelace like object changing into ball shape.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It looked like a star but too bright and changing colors; thought maybe it was a star.  I was facing south, object was west of the moon and south of Orion&#39;s belt to start at the end it had moved at least 90 degrees WNW.<n> <n><n> <n><n> You could tell it was changing from green-blue hues. I called my wife out (non-believer at this point) and she brought her camera (studio quality).  We took tons of photos and when zoomed in you can tell it is a long straight object changing from purple, green, white, blue, turquoise, and different shades of those.<n> <n><n> <n><n> During our duration outside taking pictures we had watched it with the naked eye changing from a flat line to a ball or orb shape. It moved around  in a zig-zaging and making what seamed to be horseshoes. also we had noticed something come out of it only because it would blink red and disappear going north (you can only see this when it is flashing hard to capture in a picture).<n> <n><n> <n><n> Upon further review of these photos we noticed the object started straight and from picture to picture you can see it change into almost a crooked T, to the shape of a italicized F into a ball (our eyes scene what we thought was a tail, we think the picture of the F shape).  The pictures made it seam almost like we photographed a LED rope being wiggled until the F shape..  That made it mind blowing It would go way out of distance (atmosphere?) and come back flatten out and be in a different area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The strangest thing happened after our adrenaline was flowing like mad men:  the pictures from tonight that was had been going through on the camera somehow were erased between pulling the SD from camera to computer.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We are truly baffled because we took another picture after seeing they&#39;d be deleted and it saved, none of the settings had been tampered with nor was the card full.  Are we the only ones who this has happened too..   Did we take too many pictures and they &#34;magically&#34; get erased..?<n> <n><n> <n><n> Please tell me someone has scene this flat object same colors, we are positive of what we have scene no possibility it was an air craft or jet.  We are by an airport and know what an airplane looks like.  This was truly a mind blowing and almost life altering even to know what we have seen was real.<n> <n><n> <n><n> You believe me..  Right..?<n>

The sky was clear, night blue, and bright from the moon light with no clouds and  several stars. I noticed movement and turned my eyes toward it (slightly to my left), and could see dimly lit objects gliding across the sky going to the right of me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I blinked my eyes several times to get a good focus before asking my Daughter who was to the right of me getting out from the passenger side to look at what I was looking at.  She confirmed to me she was seeing them too and we both asked each other what they were.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When discussing it we both agreed we were seeing dimly lit lights 8 to 10 of them, evenly spaced one next to the other, traveling together moving foreword in a straight line leaving the Virginia area and heading towards Waldorf.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Although they weren&#39;t moving extremely fast, after getting over the initial shock of it all, we couldn&#39;t unlock our phones fast enough to get a picture before they disappeared in the distance<n>

It was around 19:50 and I was watching the people on the ski lift and I was looking South in the sky.  It was a full moon and no cloud cover, it was a clear night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I witnessed two balls of fire, one was dim and seemed a little further away, while the other one was brightly burning. they were moving in opposite directions.  I could not tell how far away nor the actual size.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am in the U.S. Army and I immediately ruled out a fixed wing aircraft and within a couple more seconds I was able to determine it was not a rotary winged air craft either.  I got the attention of an employee at the snow sled area and I also informed my wife to look and video tape it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was in the sky for approximately 8-10 minutes.<n>

My daughter and I saw 4 of them flying almost directly overhead in July 2010 and again on New years eve the same year.  Tonite my wife and I saw 4 of them, only difference was three of these orbs were a very bright white lite in a horizontal formation.  After watching these lights for approximately ten to fifteen minutes as they stood stationary over our local mountains 2 of them completely disappeared, one of them just kinda dimmed and one red orb appeared for about a minute or two, I asked the wife to grab my binoculars and the second she went to get them the red orb kinda did a flicker thing and disappeared as they usually do?  I have been watching the one white light that remained after the others disappeared for about an hour and I observed it dim itself 2 times.  You can clearly see that there are no houses in the area where they are and I kno! w from personal experience that they are not ranger stations.  I have seen these reddish orbs in the night sky from time to time for over a year now and have discovered that these same orbs are being seen world wide.  There must be a reason why they are often seen in my area, just wish I knew what it is!<n>

What appears to be a star perhaps but the color of a yellow diamond.  This is how I can differentiate them immediately from bright white stars around them.  You have to keep your eyes on them for 30 seconds or so but they always move. Left to right and versa, up and down versa.  Some nights like last night Monday I told my Dad to drive up to the lake ( Pinery ) and I was immediately able to spot this one as it was rapidly changing colors faster the my eyes and brain could process.  I have hawk eyes, have always looked at the night sky since a child, but if you we&#39;re to glance at these for a second or so they would appear to be just another star a yellowish tinted star unless they are doing their light show which seems to be later in the evening. When I sit on the dock at night their always seems to be one pretty much straight ahead but elevated in the sky. Up and left from Orion&#39;s Belt. I am very familiar with Aircraft, Military and otherwise and this is nothing we have even keeping in mind they hid Stealth from us for over 30 years, SR 71 etc. This object even in its basic of aerobatic moves has got to be moving in excess of 5,000 M.P.H. In my opinion. And when it is done ( toying ) with you or whatever they are up to it takes off at no predetermined flight path at least nothing that makes any sense and they move. Conservatively I would say in the 10,000 M.P.H. or more. Last night the one thing that seemed different is that they almost seemed to have an additional much smaller circular light on the structure as well but a seventh to tenth of the object in question. I have been  observing these for months, I reside in the Pinery. This has been almost nightly with one always being about vertical over my house. Can&#39;t seem to gauge size or distance but erratic moves can be seen by my Father who doesn&#39;t have the eyesight he used to. Nothing Government and not a high powered laser ! because they would need to have an end to the beam for it to s! hine and be visible? I look for these ( guys ) every night and seem to have gotten a method to finding one in about 20 seconds or less now that I know what I am looking for. Also have footage but from I phone that I was able to set at angle and press record so I feel given the opportunity to enlarge this video it could shed some light pun intended on what the heck is going on. Also aircraft in vicinity all over and not on glide slope to D.I.A. Have also seen and heard F-16 Falcons from Buckley being scrambled with afterburner just under Mach 1 having no effect on the flight characteristics of these U.F.O.&#39;s. Very awesome more than slightly disconcerting. Hope they are friendly because something tells me my .40 cal might best be best suited to use against myself in lieu of going for a ride! But than again if I could be assured of no anal probing what a ride that would be until your blood started boiling. I&#39;m also sure of more than 3 and possibly smaller barely visible smaller ships. ! The 3 main ones always seem to be in pretty much the same place in sky not exact, when you line them up with a star you know it&#39;s no satellite and if you look hard enough you I can find many more in further reaches of sky. I always knew since a kid. Had that feeling or encounter? This vilifies my certainty of existence.<n>

Upon a windy, cloudy (but not covered) sky, straight above the witness’ head (very steep angle), happened the event, lasting no more than 0.5 seconds, but no less than 0.12 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The anomaly was unlikely a form of lightning, due to the duration, size, and shape.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The ‘light’, which again was a massive strobe, could be described as; oval or circle or rectangle (or even square) (to match a best description of its top-down (or ground-to-air view, bird’s eye from the ground, etc.)).  The SIZE description as; massive, football field (much larger – 3 to 4 times this size or even larger).  The size of the entire light portion of the ‘craft’ (the defined shape, most notably ‘rectangle’/futbol field with a ‘central sun’ or ‘focus point’ (seemingly the witness’ location, but at a height of only about 60-100 feet above) low in the clouds (clouds fast moving, ‘focus point’ occulted by the cloud cover, although cloud cover not total – moon waning, shining in the west).<n> <n><n> <n><n> Also notable about the consciousness of the witness – the awareness at the time of “Indians”.  Not “India” such as Kashmir, but of the Native American Indian.  The ‘awareness’, ‘ESP’, ‘tele’, etc. was certainly ‘dulled’ at the time of the event, but included subconscious notable features; Indians, Redskins, Native American Indian, American Dream, American Spirit, American Spirit (cigarette) (natural tobacco), Football Field, Redskins vs. Cowboys, Star (5 points), Cube Form (RGIII, (playoff)), Washington Post, holiday time, new year (time for exposure for anomalies).  The subconscious ‘timing’ of these events is believed by the witness to be ‘data’ supporting the timing of the sighting, and the importance in the witness’ own life (spiritual).<n> <n><n> <n><n> It could also be reported and fit a description that a “flying wing” (but massive in size and silent in sound) was moving at a very fast speed, engaged a light on/off (or simply sped up [down] and then up, and the light was never ‘off’).  Contrary to the physics of the last descriptive sentence (flying down, then up, with light on), the witness’ account does not recall ‘vertical’ movement, but ‘horizontal’ movement from North (but ‘starting’ just South of the Airport), travelling Southeast (or travelling in a vertical direction, but ‘the light’ expanding towards the Southeast (probably only an apparency of the witness’ viewpoint) (also, the ‘light’ was centralized like a candle flame is, only the light expanded – so it is unique that movement was also sensed).  It can also be said that ‘lack of movement’ had caused a dizzying ‘need’ or ‘deception’ of movement, in which the witness may or may not have seen, but the ‘elapsed time’ of the light/strobe anomaly seemed more ‘still! ’.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Nevertheless of the movement, the flash/ball/oval/field/rectangle blanketing WAS seen and realized, with almost definite ‘source’ to the light, pinpointed near/above witness’ location.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Finally, it can be noted that the witness believes it is possible for the “craft” to belong to mankind, but if so, secret/not public knowledge.  It is doubtful, from the witness’ consideration, that the “craft” (if in reality, a craft composed of matter, as explained above) is of primitive technologies (such as publicly known U.S. Military technologies).<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

It made no noise at all.It even maneuvered as if it was floating along the wind currents a few times but was traveling a fast pace just the speed of a normal aircraft that would fly over though this object was not on any normal path I&#39;ve seen the regular planes take before.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I jumped outside and ran out to the middle of the yard and watched it coming over to my left.

There were about 10 of them - very bright, a deep orange/red color.  All in a straight line front to back, except for three of them (the middle ones) which were in a row / side by side.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The three side by side moved / swirled strangely and around each other.  They were moving all in succession heading from S/SE to the N/NW direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first glance I thought maybe they were helicopters, but they were a deep orange/red color with no sound (not helicopters)!<n> <n><n> <n><n> After watching for about 1 minute or so, the ones in the middle began to fade out, then the ones toward the front, then the ones in the rear.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The &#34;leader&#34; of the lights stayed for another minute, then I stopped watching and went into the store.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was nobody else in the store parking lot at that time, but surely hundreds of others saw these objects, whatever they were.<n>

Also I looked to see if there was any stars in the direc! tion of the thing but I did not see any so the thing must have been really bright; I don&#39;t know if that means anything but that&#39;s what I observed.

Venus, at that time of night, is almost directly due East. This &#34;light&#34; was on a south-southwest path in the sky...looking up, it was also about 70-75 degrees above the horizon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first I thought it was coming towards me, and that the &#34;big light&#34; was the headlights of a jet.  Then I realized that it was going AWAY from me, and that the quality of the light coming from it was different to that of a jet headlight...more like it was lit from within.  With this understanding, the dog and I stopped in our front yard...I watched.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I looked on, the &#34;light object&#34; dimmed a bit, then, SPLIT INTO 3 separate smaller objects. Each one, though not as bright as the original, was also a &#34;ball of light.&#34;<n> <n><n> <n><n> As soon as they were clearly separated from one another, they took off in 3 different directions...1 took a more southerly route, 1 went straight forward for a second then shot straight UP, and the third one banked sharply to the right (my right) and headed on a north-northwest trajectory.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The time that elapsed between separation and all 3 being no longer visible was about 15-20 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As for a time frame, from first sighting to the end, the entire event lasted around 45 seconds to a minute.<n>

They were right over the tree line.  They was very close. There were three of them, all shaped like a V.  Each one had 3 bright glowing lights on the bottoms of the craft along with reds lights.  Also, all three crafts were flying/hovering in a triangle formation.  I quickly climbed on a rocky hill to get a better look. They were a couple hundred feet above when I gave a signal with my flashlight and then they pivoted 90 degrees to my right and flew off rather fast.  I was alone in the dark scared shitless.  At first i thought it was a military aircraft (on the account of a nearby local airforce base)  But military aircraft do not hover that low to the ground in such a tight formation.  Apparently a few other people saw similar things in the Lowcountry in the past month.<n>

After a few minutes her son came into her house and said “mom come outside and look in the sky” she told me to come outside too so I did.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I walked out onto my driveway and looked up I saw two lights up in the sky moving at a pretty steady pace, I knew immediately that they were not airplanes and they were unlike any aircraft I had ever seen, they were traveling pretty close together and all of a sudden there came a cluster of them.  They were like all in a line traveling the same direction.  They appeared to be coming from the southwest traveling north.  I thought that we were being attacked or something because they kind of looked like missels traveling through the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> All of a sudden they all disappeared in the same spot.  We don’t know if they went behind clouds or just disappeared.  I am 53 years old and I have never seen anything like this before.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were all startled and after they were gone I went inside and called the news station and asked them if there had been any other reports and they said no at least not yet.  I also tried several times to call the air traffic control to see if they picked up anything on their radar but they never answered the phone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My neighbors son also took pictures of the event with his cell phone and has them posted on Facebook.  When he enlarges the photos they look like a red slender fiery object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is the first time I have ever reported anything like this and also the first time I have ever seen anything like this in my lifetime.

I was coming down a large hill and approaching an intersection next to a small town called Edwards in Illinois.  I was driving North and on the left side of the road there is this small area that I believe is dedicated to preserving native prairie grass.  Out of that area, I saw a light ascend at about a 70 degree angle for approximately 6 seconds.  The light was reddish and small and shaped like a cigar.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After 6 seconds the light disappeared.  I was near an airport when this happened but the object was moving much faster than any aircraft I have ever seen and also like I said, it seemed to lauch off of the ground and was very small.  The closest comparison I can think of is to a firework, a roman candle specifically.<n> <n><n> <n><n> However this object did not behave like a firework, it was a steady light source and it maintained a straight trajectory.

12/28/12 17:45|Northridge|CA|Teardrop|25 minutes|White teardrop object with lights going on then off with helicopter very close by|2/4/13|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/095/S95565.html|118|ndxe201212| White teardrop object with lights going on then off with helicopter very close by<n> <n><n> <n><n> At approximately 5:45pm on Friday, December 28th, 2012, I witnessed a helicopter hovering over a white teardrop shaped object.  I estimate the object and helicopter were about a 1/2 mile from me and approximately 800 to 1000 feet high.  Two other helicopters hovered close by.  I would estimate the two other helicopters were a 1/4 mile from the object and helicopter.  One of these other helicopters was north, the other was to the east.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first, I thought the helicopter was towing the object.  The white object was about the same size as the helicopter.  The white object had at least three small white/yellow lights on top of it.  These lights went out.  The helicopter would move when the object moved; perhaps about a hundred feet at a time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After about 10 minutes, the object’s lights came back on and when the object moved so did the helicopter.  About 5 minutes later, the other two nearby helicopters flew away from the area. About 5 minutes later, the object’s lights went out again.   By this time, the object and helicopter were within about 100 yards of my position at about the same elevation.  This was when I noticed that the white object was not being towed by the helicopter as it was some yards in front of the helicopter and slightly below it..<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then, about 5 minutes later, the white object emitted a lot of bright white lights and began to move away from the helicopter, which followed the object.  Both craft went behind a tree and when I moved around the tree both the helicopter and object had disappeared.  That’s what truly freaked me out. I scanned the horizon but could not see the helicopter or the object.  I am at lost to explain what the white object was, or how the helicopter and the object seemed to disappear.<n>

I really can&#39;t explain what I saw in the sky over Orlando, FL in any other way except that they either came from some other planet or our government has made something far more technically advanced than anyone can imagine.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was coming in my long driveway in Chuluota facing West looking towards Orlando and the international airport. I am used to seeing planes landing all the time as there is usually a continuous line of them coming in full of Disney World vacationers.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I saw a couple of lines of aircraft (lights) lined up as if coming in for a landing but were too close to each other. I remember saying to myself &amp;quot;Boy, they really have the planes stacked up tonight at the airport&amp;quot;.   But there were two things that weren&#39;t right. First they were coming in from the West too close to the runway and second, they were the wrong color with only one light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Instead of the usual color of landing lights, these were bright red or red orange and pulsing slightly. I parked my car and came back out in the yard where I could see them well.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was one line of four going very slow as if in a landing pattern gradually descending coming from the West with another line of three lined up in the same direction several miles to the north. I saw a jet airliner gaining altitude going North having just taken off from OIA and flew right by the lead light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After a short time the lead light started climbing with no increase in speed at a very sharp angle, maybe 75 or 80 degrees. the second and so forth started following the leader up into a cloud hanging over an area to the south of them.  When the first line disappeared into the cloud the second line did the same thing then I noticed more coming out from behind the tree line and they did the same thing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I never saw any of them again. It was cloudy to the south but very clear every other part of the area and the full moon was out. So I had a perfectly clear view of all of them until they disappeared into the cloud. The total number was about 12 or 13.<n>

I was driving so I looked and thought at first glance a tower of some sort.  It was well past dusk.  Then upon further notice it seemed they red dots were moving.  First it looked like two then three. We pulled the car over and watched.  The reddish blinking lights seemed to be moving but not necessarily going any where.  It seemed to be now four blinking lights.  Making different formations in the skyline just over the pine tree line in the distance.  Triangle formations and even staggered line patterns. We watched for as long as we could before we had to get it the car and head home.  Once in our neighborhood we couldn&#39;t see the area anymore due to trees.  But it seemed to be hanging around for awhile.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.  PD))<n>

I noticed in the sky about 300 feet above tree level a bright white light.  After about a mile I concluded it must be a spotlight from a helicopter.  The light remained fixed, slightly to the east of the road.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I approached my home I turned into the drive and the light remained fixed in the sky above and behind my garage.  As my headlights illuminated the garage the light dropped rapidly behind the garage.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I parked my car and walked to the back of the yard to investigate.  The tree line, approximately 600 feet in back of a tilled field, was backlight with a bright light.  I went into the house retrieved a flashlight and camera.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I then proceeded down a lane on the south property line. The backlight was no longer bright but more of an amber color.  Because it was a full moon and the ground was snow covered I kept the flashlight off as I approached.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was within 100 feet of the tree lin! e when the amber light went suddenly out.  At this point I lost my nerve and returned to the house, locked the door and closed the curtains.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This morning I walked to the back of our property to complete my investigation.  There was nothing to indicate anything unusual happen the night before.<n>

The lights were three blocks from their homes.  One set was a semi circle.  The second set was in a triangle shape.  They turned onto a side street to observe.  The lights began to blink out one at a time till they were all gone.  No sound come from the lights.  Being a UFO investigator for many years I conclude these lights may have been attached to objects but it was too dark to see the objects.  I come to this conclusion because the lights were evenly space on both the triangle and semi circle and blinked out one at a time in succession.<n>

The object did not have any aviation lights and wasn’t moving very fast. I began to observe this object hard because it wasn’t normal to me.   The distance was not far at all from me judging by the speed and the point of view.  I was startled and called my girlfriend at home telling her about what I was seeing.  She lives only a half mile north east of my position.  I told her to drop what she was doing and look out her back window to verify.  She did see it, but barley because of how low it seemed.    It wasn’t raining, but the clouds had a very low ceiling and it was almost misting outside.  There were planes above going to O’Hare, which were higher than this object.  The planes were heading east like normally lining up for landing and their head lamps ! were coming through the clouds in a fog.  These planes lights were totally different and moving a lot faster. I know in my mind that this light wasn’t normal at all.  I’ve lived in this area 25 years and I know what planes look like.  I also work next to Dupage Airport and see all different types of planes every day.  Trust when I say this was not a conventional aircraft.   If I were to accurately guess the height of the object I would say it was similar or lower than a single prop private plane would fly.  As the light turned green I almost was directly under it and followed it left down a side street as it was heading in a south eastern direction.  Now I’ve caught up with the object and it was basically directly above me as my head is above my dashboard looking straight up through the windshield.  I pulled over to the right of the road at a park to get a good look at it.  Once I got out of my car, there were 4-5 other similar objects all congregated in this air space abov! e me seemingly out of nowhere.  The only noise I heard was the! sound o f passing cars and a plane that was in the area.  These other objects were not a glowing amber color like the original, but almost a white color and brighter.  I did not notice if these objects were in a certain formation or not because my mind was running a million miles a minute, but they were in some sort of cluster.  As they began to move south east again, I hopped in my car and tried to follow again through a windy loopy neighborhood, but they were all gone within another minute or so with no trace.<n>

I couldn’t see it with my naked eye, I had to take a picture of it to show up in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The craft looked like two spheres on top, and a figure eight design on the bottom.  The top two spheres looked like the front of a bra would and white, the bottom looked like metal.  There was a pink miasma that surrounded it but only in the picture as well.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The craft was very small, and I had to zoom in on the picture to see it clearly, but most definitely not a normal craft to see flying about.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was flying not super low, but it wasn’t high up in the sky either.<n>

Then noise stopped suddently after about two minutes and imediately after i heard multiple helicopers in the sky as if they were following what was making the noise.  The helicoper and the unidentified noise were very different.  The unidentified sound was louder and like a pulsing siren, a siren with low bass.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Description - At this point i went to look out of my window.  Slightly above the building directly across from me was a line of slowly flashing lights from left to right.  The body of the craft wasnt visible but the lights were in a perfect line like a disk shape.  These lights flashed blue and red.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The lights were steady as stars in the sky until minutes later when it grew in size as if it came closer then drifted off to the right.<n>

As i saw it initially and watched it I knew it was not an aircraft and internally wished it would come closer, the object seemed to hear my internal voice and curved towards me.  As it stopped short about 40 feet from me I was a little scared and internally verbalized that Jesus was my lord and savior, at this point the object moved away west and then at edge of building south again.  I also heard a voice say it is nothing as it started moving away a female voice but it was internal not external.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I could not see or hear any motor device.

I checked to see if there were any reports on it that coincided with what I saw between Christmas and New Year.  I was surprised to find a report here on 12/5/12 of an almost exact sighting of 3 oval shaped objects in the sky at the exact location that I saw them 2 weeks later.<n> <n><n> <n><n> While driving home from Philadelphia on I-76 between Christmas and New Year, I saw 3 bright lights that later I saw were football shaped objects in the sky around the King of Prussia area that I watched for quite a while.  At first I thought they were bright planets or stars.  Then I thought since we were moving in a car that they were planes that were moving, also.  I lost sight of one of them, only to see the 3 back together once we made a turn on the road.  Once we were ‘under’ one of them, I looked up to see 2 red lights surrounded by some white lights in a football shape.  I thought if this were a plane, there should be tail lights.  But I didn’t see any shadow or lights that indicated a tail.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I watched them stationary in the sky until we got to the Limerick/Pottstown area of I-76 and then I couldn’t see them anymore.  The strange thing, though, is we made this same trip several more times during that week and I saw them at least once more that I remember.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date is approximate.

About five minutes before we reached Pine bush I yelled to my daughter to look at the falling star coming from the North ( left side of us).<n> <n><n> <n><n> I slowed down to view this with her.  It appeared really big and was glowing really bright blue at the tip and around the sides and out of the back.  We thought for sure it would crash and catch something on fire.  We waited and heard and saw nothing after it was out of our range of view.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Later that evening  at approximately 9:30 p.m. my daughter and I were driving East on 17K through Pine Bush, N.Y. when we saw about 15 dark orange orbs flying  in a diagonal pattern across the sky starting above the tree line. We pulled over to the side of the road and opened the windows and heard absolutely no sound coming from them. We dismissed them from being helicopters or another form of aircraft by the way they wer! e almost hovering in the sky traveling slowly in an upwards diagonal  without any sound being emitted. They were traveling from north to south in staggered pairs of 2 and 3 orbs with almost an even space between them. Once they seemed to get to a certain height they began to travel along a horizontal path across the sky in front of us and then one by one they began to just disappear at the exact same point. We watched the very last one and did not take our eyes off of it the entire time and sure enough the same thing happened. I then drove down a bit on 17K hoping to see any trace or perhaps there was an obstruction or cloud hiding them. Unfortunately, these orbs seemed to just vanish. I don&#39;t know if these two occurrences were related but I can&#39;t help to think they were.<n>

These objects were all yellow centered with an orange corona, appearing much like the rear view of a fighter jet engine at take-off.  None of the objects made any noise nor showed any visible contrail or vapor stream.  Being a moonlit night such streams are visible even with aircraft at higher cruising heights.  We live on the pathway to Bangor International Airport and regularly see a variety of aircraft including all type of military aircraft as the facility hosts a military installation.   The objects observed did not have any flashing lights as is required on all aircraft.  from our vantage point, the objects appeared to be at a height similar to that used by light aircraft, so on the order of 1000 to 1500’.  At this height, and compared to the size of the moon on this night, the objects appeared to be 1/10th  the size of t! he moon, or as a reverse comparison quite a few times larger than the largest star visible.  In terms of brightness, the yellow portion of the object was as bright as the brightest star.  When I first noticed the object it appeared to be coming toward me and I thought it was the headlight on the front running gear of a large airliner, as it had a similar brightness.  However as the object came closer and no longer was coming at me but going by me it had no shape other than an orb and on such a moonlit night it would have been easy to tell if it had wings or resembled a standard aircraft.  Five members my family witnessed these objects.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I contacted the Maine Stage Police who sent a trooper to patrol the area for signs of fireworks or flares, but reported back that nothing was observed.  On the next day I contacted Bangor International Airport, and through a few calls ended up at the air traffic control tower.  My call was returned later that day, and in talking to the tower they mentioned that the previous night one of the people on duty had noticed a bright light to the west (which would be toward where I am located from the airport), thought nothing of it, and when he returned to the window it was not present.  I was told that radar did not pick up anything out of the ordinary, but they are only tracking things with transponders.<n>

They moved about randomly and then the four lighter circles formed into a square (right angles and equidistant) and held that pose for several seconds before moving away.  No guess on speed.

I could not see the “halo” part the whole time; it kind of flickered a bit, but the bright bottom was illuminated steadily.  I only saw one light at first.  It was silent and its movement seemed directional, not as if it were just drifting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I went back in and called others to come out and see (7 people in total). The first light was still there and I then saw two additional lights behind it, all having the same general characteristics (atypical from SkyLanterns, as the “structure” above was not always visible). They seemed to be traveling on a “flat plane” at the same general altitude (guess-timated at 500 ft.) and then when they were over the property where we were standing, they seemed to go straight up, with the lights becoming smaller until they disappeared (possibly through the cloud cover). There was no further additional travel to the west, just seemingly “up” above the house and then out of sight. All in all, the lights were visible for about 3 minutes maximum. Roughly 2/3 of this time was in “flat planar” travel and 1/3 in what appeared to be vertical travel.<n> <n><n> <n><n> While outside watching, I heard the reaction of neighbors to the left who were also observing, and their tone was of excited confusion. (A bit of &#34;What IS that?&#34; in excited speech).  I could not hear all of what was being said however.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I got home and had the opportunity to check weather stats from a local media weather site (WIVB ~9:20pm), the winds were noted as 4mph E on the site’s front-page, and 0 mph calm N in their &#34;Current Conditions&#34; section.  Precipitation reflection on radar (for upper level winds) showed a very slow trend from north to south in direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I checked additional stats taken from another weather website -  (Visibility 10.0 miles, Clouds Few 2800 ft Overcast 3900 ft (Wunderground) 10:55pm)   I also checked local news websites and their individual reporting forums for any type of chatter about sky sightings but didn’t find anything. Still curious, I went back outside several times, not expecting to see anything, but saw another orange light southwest over Main St. at 8:59pm, and then saw a grouping of 4 others “behind” the first, to the south (guess-timated at 800 ft.).  I lost track of the first, but they all came from the south traveling north and then seemed to angle west northwest and begin to go more vertically (~65 degree elevation from horizon). They then followed this trajectory slowly to the cloud cover and disappeared. The bright lights that were their primary composition would become smaller and smaller, although with similar brightness, as it elevated (counterintuitive to a flame in a SkyLantern exhausting itself), and it seemed to me that they were breaking through the cloud barrier.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The group of 4 moved somewhat randomly although all in the same (very distinct) direction. All were going to the same area in the distance, but moving in and around each other in getting there.  There was then noticed that there was one straggler about 30 seconds behind. The group of 4 was almost gone when I noticed the last. This last one followed the same general trajectory, although it did seem to stay illuminated longer. Possibly due to height variance in cloud cover? These lights seemed to have the same longevity as the first group noticed at about 8:05pm, at least in terms of proportion. They were seemingly 2/3 “planar” motion and 1/3 more vertical motion.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In total, the first group had 3 lights (1, then 2 following) at around 8:05pm and the later group had 6 in total (1, then 4, then 1) at ~9:00pm. Land distance between the two sightings was about 1.5 mi. The first group traveled from east to west then roughly at a 90 degree altitude straight up (total time observed – about 3 minutes), and then the second group from south to north then WNW at ~65 degree altitude (total time observed – about 5 minutes). I have seen nothing since. (I checked off-and-on till about 12:30am that night) I saw nothing great through binoculars either. I only had a good look at the last light in the second group, and its size did not change to any great degree—maybe it was too distant.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thanks again Peter for the good work that you do.<n>

I thought they were helicopters but as I got a closer look and they moved over my car they just looked like stars but flying the same height a helicopter would.  They were in the formation of a V all separated by a few hundred feet (estimate).  There was one that seemed to be further away from the others.  It was dark so all I could see was the colors opposed to the actual shape or dimensions.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I opened my window to see if I could hear the sound of helicopters but heard nothing.  Other cars around me also seemed to slow down and look.  Whatever it was came off the ocean and Jacksonville has a big military base so it very well could have been helicopters but I have seen them throughout the years and to me these didn&#39;t look like them.  As I drove away they disappeared..<n>

The moon was almost full but not high in the sky yet,  The sky was getting dark however it was also getting lighter because of the rising moon.  I was standing at my kitchen window when something very bright caught my eye, I knew right away this was something very different than what I was use to seeing out my kitchen window and if one was not enough then came another one shortly behind it .  I put down what I was doing and ran outside , I did not turn on any outside lights and my yard is very open and quiet with no street or any other kinds of lights for miles around. What I was looking at was two fire like balls almost an oval shape. about 3/4 of the object around was bright fire red and the leading side had yellowish to white light.  They were moving from the town area over Chena Ridge t! o the Parks Highway area, not to fast and not to slow in a slightly curved direction this only lasted about 2 min start to finish and they were gone when I went outside there was no noise they were very silent or in stealth mode<n>

As we were standing outside, I noticed a dark spot in the sky that was not moving.  It was hovering in the same spot, as birds and planes were visible in the same sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We went into the house after being outside for a half hour, and then kept peeking out the window to see if the object was still there.  It was.  Soon after, our power went out for about a minute, at most.  Nothing else was going on that would cause the power to go out.  Within thirty minutes of being inside, my mom noticed twinkling lights in the sky below the dark object that we initially saw.  We immediately went outside onto the deck and I took some video of what we were seeing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In the video, you can see multiple flashing lights in a horizontal pattern, hovering in the same general spot.  At certain points, you could then see the same line of lights tilting and then going vertical.  We definitely got the impression that lighted object is probably disc shaped.  We stood outside for at least 20 minutes watching these lights.  Based on the fact that we live below a flight path and see commercial airliners flying overhead constantly, we would guess that the object with the lights was very large since the lights went so far across the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The clouds began to roll in and the flashing lights disappeared.  After the flashing lights disappeared, I took a still shot of the dark object.  After uploading the image to the computer and zooming in, I would describe the shape of this object to be more of a chevron-shaped object.  Within a half hour, the dark object was not visible anymore either.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My husband and I are both college educated, professional, rational people.  Neither one of us has ever seen anything like this before, and can’t seem to find any other explanation for what we saw in the sky today.<n>

It seemed they were about 15 to 20 feet in diameter and moving about 50 to 80 mph  level about 300 to 500 ft altitude until they dashed away at extremely high speed.

It zigzagged moving very fast. It then took off and the size of the object was greatly reduced as well as the strength of the light it emitted. I was hoping someone else was outside at the time, but after it disappeared I noticed no one else was outside. As I approached my home I had saw my neighbors outside I looked up and the object appeared out of nowhere again, traveling at great speeds and it was a very strong light emitting from the object. Luckily, my neighbors were outside and they were waiting for family for Christmas Eve to arrive. My neighbor actually had a camera around his neck, I shouted to him look up look up.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My neighbor was outside with his two young daughters and we were all amazed at how this object traveled and how it disappeared and then reappeared. It had disappeared and reappeared three times in total that night up to about 12 AM.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My neighbor took several pictures of the object. This had no characteristics of a plane or helicopter, it moved at such speeds and such different directions that it could not have been anything we know of right now. It was able to hover, take off, and hover, disappear then reappear. The light it gave off was captivating.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My neighbor and I are waiting for the film to develop. I am very excited to see how this object looks on film. I can assure you, there is no way possible it was a plane or helicopter. Without a doubt it has to be defined as as a UFO.<n> <n><n> <n><n> One more note,the light this object was giving off was so bright that you couldn&#39;t really make out the shape of the object. But, when I had seen it appear out of nowhere as it went across the sky I could see somehow, the top of the object. The top was a circular shape, like I could make out the top half of the object. I don&#39;t know if because it accelerated out of nowhere that I could make out the top half of the object, but after that the light was too strong to see the physical shape of the object. The light that was a emitting from it was a circular shape, like a fire ball.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Note- the film still has to be developed. If my neighbor was able to get the image in his shot, of which I am positive he did, it should be amazing proof as I have never seen a thing like it. Please inform me of the best way to send the images. Thanks.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
12/24/12 22:15|Santa Rosa|CA|Triangle|1-2 minutes|Three bright orange triangular lights seen by elementary school teacher on Christmas Eve-Not Santa's sleigh.|2/4/13|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/095/S95517.html|194|ndxe201212| Three bright orange triangular lights seen by elementary school teacher on Christmas Eve-Not Santa&#39;s sleigh.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Three Orange Triangular Lights in the Sky  It was Christmas Eve around 10:00 p.m.  It was a clear night with what looked to be a full moon.  The moon was shining bright with a huge white circular illumination.   I went outside into my backyard to let my dog out to go to the bathroom.  I sat down and waited for her.  I looked up and saw an orange triangular light in the sky the size of a small plane.  It was to the left of the moon’s light.  I thought it odd because it was bright orange.  I see planes overhead at night all the time and know that the planes’ lights blink white and orange.  This object did not, but it didn’t get my attention just yet.  I looked back down and continued to wait for my dog.  When I looked back up again the object had not passed overhead.  It was almost as if it had passed round again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I continued to look up in the sky I now saw another orange triangular light.  I had never seen two “planes” so close together and thought it very strange.  As I continued to look, a third orange light came into view.  Now there were three orange lights in the sky in a triangular position.  It was at this time, I believed without a doubt, that I was seeing some sort of U.F.O.  I was scared but intrigued.   I stared at the three objects for a while and waited for them to pass overhead but they didn’t.  They just hovered.  The lights never blinked like planes and it was silent.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Eventually, one light slowly moved to the right and out of my range of sight.  It was blocked by my patio umbrella.  I kept my eye on the two lights in front of me.  Then one of the lights slowly moved to the left.  By now the lights were getting smaller and shrinking into more of a circular orange light.  My eyes darted back and forth between the two smaller orange lights until they became white like stars and faded off.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I just kept watching to see if the lights would come back but they didn’t.  The next thing I saw in the sky was a plane.  I watched it carefully to see what the lights would do.  I saw orange and white lights blinking, and of course I heard the sound. What I had seen were clearly not planes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I knew that what I had observed was extraordinary and told my family on Christmas day.  Everyone believed me and told me to post my sighting.  So here it is.  I am an elementary school teacher and not into U.F.O. stuff at all.  I truly believe what I saw was real and very strange.  I feel lucky to have seen it.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

As I crossed the street, I looked up to the western sky and noticed a bright orange-ish to red colored object.  At first I thought it might be a planet, but realized that it was in the wrong position to be Mars.  As I crossed back to my house, I observed another object rise up from below the visible horizon in the western sky and rise quickly to just below the first object.  At that time I called out my wife and my mom and dad to observe the objects.  The first object faded out and a third object rose up and joined the second one.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My father and I are both retired Naval Aviators, and I continue to fly as a law enforcement officer and pilot for the local Sheriff&#39;s Office.  I&#39;ve been flying for 27 years, my father for 28, and neither of us have ever seen these types of lights associated with aircraft before.  They seemed to be traveling at extremely high speeds, almost like rockets.  We did not see any navigational or anti-collision lights on any of the objects.<n>

Every few minutes it would drop a red light that looked like a shooting star out of it and it would fall towards the ground.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My husband saw five lights fall out of it total, and I saw two of them myself.  We called our three kids outside who stood and watched it with us.  It then stopped up in the clouds for roughly five minutes before it almost just kind of faded out while it was hovering in place.<n>

The object was on a west to east track at approximately 6-10K feet.  It had a bright red light and glow that would slowly change to yellow then back to red.  It did not have running lights or wing  beacons. From our observation place, the light was the size and brightness that one would see on top of a cell tower mast about .5 mile away.  In the Christmas spirit, we remarked that it could be Rodolph the red nosed reindeer. In reality it was bright enough to hold our attention due to its unique glow.  Given its location, in the Medford airspace, we thought it was a private plane at first, or a small remote.  We heard no motor or jet.  At one point its east bound track paused and then it reversed direction; it did not turn around like an aircraft, it just changed directions and appeared to go up in altitude until it faded away into the heavens.<n>

I looked up and saw a red object resembling a fireball in the Eastern sky.   At first I thought it may be remote control plane or Helicopter since it made a dip and disappeared for a while. About a few seconds later it rose and started to ascend travelling in a Westerly direction.  It rose very high and eventually got lost in the clouds and moved off very quickly.  The object was red and was flashing in the night sky. I recorded a short clip of about a minute where people can be heard in the background asking if it is an airplane.<n>

We had observed the moon in perfect clarity at about 6pm. Cold...35-40 degrees.  Wife and the kids and I were sitting in our bed watching TV.  There was a flash of red light outside so bright it lit up far bedroom wall.  Kids didnt notice and continued to watch TV. Wife and I immediately looked out the window towards the city (about 200 feet off the 1500 Harbor Boulevard Pier) and saw something moving extremely fast from the sky down to the water (whole event was maybe 2 seconds after the flash).  It had a bright red light on it (not like fire....like a beacon).  Size is difficult to determine.  It seemed large considering it was about 600 feet away from our window.  Maybe the size of a helicopter but made up of a much simpler design like two large iron girders (as seen when building a sky scraper) attached at a 45 degree angle with red light on one end of one of the girders.  Angle of descent was pretty much straight down (90 degrees). Seemed way to fast to just b! e something falling from a plane.  Seemed propelled.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I braced for an explosion.  I thought maybe a helicopter was crashing but there was zero sound.  Even if the object hit water, it would have HAD to make a loud boom with it&#39;s size and at the speed it was moving. At first wife thought it was a projectile (missile?). We ruled out fireworks because of the downward nature and lack of sound. I initially thought it might have been a piece of a plane....but no sound???....and its speed made it look propelled. Immediately afterward, we ran to window and scanned sky and NYC skyline.  I saw a plane high above moving Northwesterly almost right above us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About 2 minutes afterward, I saw a ferry boat on the NY side of the river heading south towards us.  Went downstairs for different perspective.  Might have seen people on a boat at the marina. The boat slip was all the way at the end of the pier on the river. I saw lights on the boat but couldn&#39;t tell if there were people outside of it. It! was very cold so it seemed unlikely.  If there were people, th! ey would have HAD to seen it.  It would have only been a few hundred feet from them. We were very frightened by the event.  My hands actually were shaking a little.  I considered reporting it to the non-emergency police number as a possible aircraft crash, but decided not to due to the lack of crash sounds and subsequent lack of visual confirmation of a crash.  On morning of 12/24/12 (8am), we went in separate rooms and drew what we had seen.  Daughter didn&#39;t witness the object but drew based on our descriptions the night before.  When we compared, we were frightened at how they are almost identical depictions.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 12/24/12 @ 1:00am  Same night.  Kids sleeping in our bed. Woken by wife bringing son to kids bathroom. I went into master bath to go to the bathroom.  No lights on in room or bathroom. Bathroom dark and has no windows.  Went to bathroom and upon exiting, noticed a green glow coming from jacuzzi bathtub.  I took a closer look and confirmed something underneath the plastic of the jacuzzi was glowing green (very similar to texture?/color of a green aurora borealis). It looked soft.  I could see it through the plastic and the glow was unmistakable.  The strangest thing is that it didn&#39;t seem to alarm or scare me.  I was very calm even though now it seems insane.  I looked at it for about 5 seconds and then walked calmly to wife in the other bedroom to tell her to come see it.  We slowly walked back to the bathroom (total elapsed time about 10-15 seconds) and looked in bathtub. Now I was shocked. The light was gone and the contrast of it now being dark and not glowing seemed to frighten me. It was like I wo! ke up to the realization that the light that was there before was completely unnatural. I knew that, unless there were indeed green lights under the plastic tub, that were somehow turned on for that short period of time, this should not have happened. I have no explanation for this event. I don&#39;t even have a hunch as to possibilities of what it was.<n>

I pulled over and used my cell phone to obtain video of them.  They looked like orange orbs or flares but they wouldn’t ‘burn out’.  They moved gingerly across the sky in the same direction.  The lights were relatively low to the ground, maybe 1000ft in the air from the ground.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The lights wouldn’t fall to the ground.  The lights did not spread or dissipate sporadically.  They seemed to just follow each other north across the sky; very intriguing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I looked all around for some sort of explanation such as a fire or a plane but, there was nothing.  I could not explain it.<n>

It appeared to be a fireball (I only say a fireball because there was an obvious red ball of fire) slowly moving across the sky.  It was visible only at breaks in the clouds (which were many) so it was above the clouds.  My husband at first thought it was an airplane on fire and actually called me into the backyard to see.  We watched it move slowly for several minutes moving from south to north then it seemed to simply stop.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My husband asked if I thought it had stopped and for about 2 seconds it seemed to be stationery. Then it suddenly developed a large red halo around it.  The fireball was no longer visible just the halo. It moved directly back from the way it came (from north to south and back toward us).  As it moved at a very fast pace the halo seemed to change in color from the bright red it started as to an orangish tint and then to a cream color.  It moved in a matter of less than 10 seconds from the north to our southern horizon with the halo growing large as it moved closer.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At the time it made it to the horizon just above the top of our trees in the south, the halo seemed to blow out and whatever it was simply disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was no sound at all during the entire process and there was nothing felt in the air although when the halo blew out it was almost like a visible sound wave that exploded.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It&#39;s just so hard to explain having never seen anything even remotely like this.<n>

Did notice a thin clooud-like trail a good distance to the left that curved up and through an actual small cloud, and right above that cloud it ended. not sure if it was part of the cloud but it did not appear to be a typical cloud attribute, closest example is like a nike swoosh?  It did seem practical by its placement that it could have been created by what we saw. other wittness was wife.<n>

It was moving up and down in a small area and at times would move up diagonally very fast before moving back down to the original position slowly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It then flashed blue once and started to slowly move north.  As it was moving north it went back to the original light pattern, and was getting harder to see. It eventually moved behind a tree line and I lost visual contact.<n>

When I reached Glacier Ridge Park at approximately 6:00 a.m. a light caught my eye that was about the relative size and shape of a star but was very bright and white.  The light abruptly dropped from the sky after being stationary in the sky.  The light fell behind the trees from the park in about a 3 second period which is beyond the physics any aircraft or satellite that I am familiar with. My hair stood up after seeing the event, and I immediately ran home.  I was not a believer before, but this has me sold. Another thing to take into consideration is that this light did not produce a streak when it dropped unlike an asteroid or comet.  I also looked at the flight pattern of the ISS and it was nowhere near the location nor did the ISS pass through my area in its flight route.<n>

I distinctly remember looking at the time on my cellular phone about five minutes earlier and it was 12:21 AM.  While approaching the stop sign, I spotted three large triangular objects hovering over the field of trees at the northwest corner of the intersection.  The three bright red glowing triangles were huge in size and were hovering very low to the tree lines.  It seemed as if I could literally reach out and grab them.  I then noticed the three objects begin moving at a steady buy slow pace north on Branders Bridge Road toward Swift Creek. Amazed at the whole situation, I began following the objects in my car down Branders Bridge Road.  As I am traveling northward up the road, the red triangular objects disappeared in and outside of the tree lines.  This section of Branders Bridge is curvy and heavily wooded.  As I approached the Swift Creek Bridge, I saw the red flying triangles hovering above Swift Creek and then &#34;In a Blink of an Eye&#34; they disappeared faster than light.  Puzzled, I drove further north up Branders Bridge Road and later cruised through the Sherwood Hills neighborhood in hopes of locating the red flying objects again.  To no avail, I did not locate these strange flying objects again.  I live a mere five minutes from the initial sighting location and the whole incident, including the long cruise, might account for 30 minutes tops; however, it was exactly 2:22 AM upon pulling into my driveway!<n> <n><n> <n><n> SECOND ENCOUNTER: About two weeks ago, I was driving down Branders Bridge Road in the late hours around 2:30 AM.  There is a railroad track on Branders Bridge Road.  As usual, I always come to a complete stop before crossing any RR tracks.  When s! topping at the railroad crossing that night I saw the SAME thr! ee brigh t lava red triangular objects hovering yet very gradually moving north toward Chester.  The three triangular objects were hovering at a higher level above the trees (wooded area).  I quickly noticed another car on the opposite side of the tracks at an intersection just a quarter mile up.  The driver was obviously witnessing the same phenomena as me.  I drove toward the car and as I got closer they quickly took off toward Colonial Heights on the opposite side of the RR tracks and then stopped again.  All I wanted to do was roll my window down and ask them to confirm what I was witnessing.  I then noticed that the red triangular objects disappeared.  A bad feeling came over me and I immediately drove home and spent hours trying to rationalize the events; which had taken place.  I never notified 911 dispatch in fear of being laughed at and not taken seriously.  I have been contemplating contacting the Colonial Heights or Chesterfield Police Departments to inquire whether or not! they have recent UFO reports on their blotters.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  For some reason, witness indicates that the date is approximate.

About 15 mins later we walked back outside and the strobing object had moved in our direction almost over our next door neighbors house.

While I was outside, I saw these sphere shapes flying slowly in the sky, they were orange/red in color, like fire.  There were no noise emanating from them, and as they flew across the sky they faded out to nothing one by one.  When I first saw them I ran inside to get my mother in law and daughter, and they came outside to see them with me.  I even called my fiance to tell him about it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have written down the pattern that I saw them fly in.  Toward the end of the 14 spheres flying, I noticed one of them did pass another one and then faded out.  That was the only one I saw fly past one.  The rest stayed in formation.  We also got a small video of a few of them, but the video is not so good.  They look like little white spheres on the video because it was at night and there was not much light out.  There was also an aircraft that was heading towards Columbus, that flew right by them.  I don&#39;t know what we saw, and can not explain it. Thank you for your time.

I went to the front yard to watch it and it was almost directly over the street in front of my house as it flew north over the tree line.

My son took pictures of the lights with his cell phone.  We stayed outside approximately 10 mins more to see if they would return but they did not.  Did anyone else see and/or report these lights?

I noticed the usual stars that I see every time I walk the dogs along with the moon but tonight I noticed a very bright round light in the sky near the moon along with two dimmer round lights.  All three formed what looked like a triangle formation.  Now what caught my eye was the bigger/brighter light started flickering or pulsing, then the light darkened and I could no longer see it.   After this happened I noticed the smaller one on the left started moving away and eventually went out of view.  The third dim light at that point to me just looked like a distant star that never went away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Now take note that as this was going on I noticed the normal jets flying high in the sky and these lights appeared to me to be higher than the jets.  Being the type of person who likes to find an explanation for everything I checked to see where the space station was currently located and it was flying over the south pole at the time of the sighting.  Now I can&#39;t rule out other debris thats flying overhead but it looked very strange to me.  I have also never seen anything that has ever resembled a UFO before or anything paranormal.  I just thought I would post this here in hopes of an explanation to what I noticed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

They somewhat resembled Chinese lanterns as they seemed kind of billowy, but they were moving very fast.  They were so far up in the sky it was impossible to recognize anything except that they had a reddish color and appeared oval shaped. It took about 15 seconds for the lights to pass.  They took turns passing each other as they headed east.  They were visible in the eastern sky as red dots making the eastern sky reddish in appearance for fifteen minutes. Then the sky went dark.<n>

It was raining and dark and I thought I was seeing reflections on the windshield from Christmas lights nearby.  My husband thought he was seeing a new light tower and was thinking “that wasn’t there before”.  But we both realized that we were seeing something strange and we pulled the car over and got out.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We didn’t know what we were seeing because we had never seen anything like it.  The lights seemed to be moving slowly, but we couldn’t tell how big or fast they were going but they were definitely there.  In fact I called my Mom who lives nearby and she saw them too.  The position of the lights was:   there were 2 lights way out in front and then some distance farther back were the other 6 lights.  They did not seem to be any special formation or pattern.  Some lights were very close to each other, and others were farther away, but different distances from each other.  As they moved across the sky they did not change their positions in relation to each other; they stayed in the same positions.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first we thought they were helicopters, but there wasn’t any noise of any kind; it was silent.  Then we thought airplanes, but some of them were much too close to each other to be airplanes, and the lights were not the same as on an airplane.  The lights were solid yellow/orange.  They did not blink at all. We both know what an airplane lights looks like at night and approximately where they are.  An airplane has blinking lights; these lights were much much bigger and remained solid.  They did not blink.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What we saw wasn’t anything we have ever seen before.  I told my husband that we had just seen our first UFO.  We watched the lights for approximately 8-10 minutes more until they disappeared into the clouds.<n>

It was not too high (approximately 1000 ft up) from the ground.  It appeared to move very slow and going away from me but noticed it had turned and seemed to be aiming to fly right over my truck.  I was on the hill leaving the farm heading towards Rt. 94.  I stopped in the middle of the rd. (no other vehicles around) and put my window down to listen for any motor or rotor noise; none heard.  The odd thing was the lights; the two red lights were at what appeared to be opposite ends of the craft and there was also a white light mixed in the middle of the two.  The red lights were EXTREMELY bright. Lights also flashed with no specific pattern noticed.  Definitely not the average wing/tail markers used on today’s aircraft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am also a local Fireman and have seen numerous emergency aircraft in my years, for which this was not something I would say was one.  I continued on and lost sight of the craft.  Once I was on Rt. 94 going south, I spotted the object again at a slightly higher altitude and flying on an Easterly course at a higher speed.  From my next turn off of Rt. 94 I lost sight of the object.  I do know there was quite a bit of traffic in the area at the time so I know there were more people who saw this anomaly.<n>

My friend was further northeast of my location between Tecumseh Rd. E and Seminole St. and saw the same contrail left behind.  When I observed it moving I could not see the actual object as it was behind the tree in our front yard and it was fairly far off in the distance. All I saw was the contrail it left immediately in its wake which started at a lower elevation and climbed to a much higher elevation.  As it climbed, it swayed from side to side slowing down every time the object curved as if it was some sort of rocket or plane that was completely out of control.  Then just as it started, the contrail stopped for no reason and the object making it was long gone only a few seconds later when I moved to a better vantage point away from the tree.  The entire event lasted about 15 seconds but the contrail lasted for a few minutes after the object creating it disappeared! and that is when I took a photo.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The picture shows the path of the contrail and was taken less than a minute after the event occurred. As I said above, it appeared that the object came out of nowhere and started making a contrail in a zigzag fashion moving up in elevation then it suddenly stopped making the contrail and from my original vantage point I could not see an object moving away from the contrail after it stopped. I did not see the contrail when it first formed so perhaps it came from the cloud deck at the bottom, but I definitely saw the contrail all of the sudden stop way up in the air for no reason.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The contrail left behind stood out over most of the city and was very easy to spot so there must be more witnesses Canadian and American. If most of the city saw this then it may have been as far away as the Detroit River at Grosse Ile or further into the United States which is where there is an airport so perhaps it came from there.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

The object(s) kept on gliding in a straight line for about 35 minutes when it suddenly disappeared.  There were no clouds in the sky since I could still see all the stars surrounding it.  It had a totally different glow than stars, and it was much stronger than theirs too.  I have never seen anything like this, and it was definitely not an airplane since their lights are much smaller, faster and doesn&#39;t have that strength in their glow.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date is approximate.

When we were near Watertown, SD, still on highway 20, I saw another one, but only caught a glimpse of it, and it appeared to be duller, but still the same color was definitely lower than the first, and slower, but more on earth, like not so much in the stars.

I was terrified.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.  PD))<n>

They appeared to come together as one object and then break apart. They moved direction very quickly.  They seemed to disappear into thin air. We tried to look through binoculars, but the lights were so bright we couldn&#39;t make out any other detail of the objects.  At the same time, we also noticed directly above us, in a cloud, a white oval shaped, faint light moving back and forth quickly as well.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

I went out to get my car to get my ipod, and by chance witnessed the object out of the corner of my eye.

This object had no noise! The object left no trail of smoke, and the object did NOT have any blinking lights whatsoever. I&#39;m so shocked and kind of scared as I write this; I have never witnessed anything so horrifyingly real that i can recall. the object sped up a little bit, and then gradually decreased speed almost unnoticably if you didn&#39;t continually look at and study the object...it kept speeding up and gradually slowing down, and repeating this but not in a perfect sequence.  It was going straight somewhat and I anticipated it to go straight past my house but it shiftet direction and veered rig! ht not at a right angle but kind of circular. As i figured it would keep going, it STOPPED.  Almost right above my house but very high in the sky, higher than an airplane or helpicopter. lIKE a period on a piece of paper, id didn&#39;t move. It was bright and there was no flickering light or lights like on an airplane or helpicopter. It stayed stationary approximately 1 minute. I was frozen and shocked, and it VANISHED. God, it just disappeared. I made sure to look in that area and all around. There was no silohette or shadow or dark object. this thing disappeared quicker than a candle light being blown out. I called my friend to reveal what i had just seen, i am so dumbfounded and in shock. I was shaking as I told her. I just want to know if anybody has ever seen this, i&#39;m lost for words. I know for fact this was a ufo spaceship of some sort. The night sky was very clear, THERE WERE NO OTHER AIR CRAFT IN THE AREA, there were no jet smoke streams in the air and the night was sil! ent, completely silent.

We live in the woods where there is little to no external light. We have seen several light phenomena&#39;s in the past during the late spring that consisted of bright white flashes of light for several hours from approximately 2300 - 0200, but nothing like this. There were first 4-5 bright glowing orbs travelling relatively the same trajectory path, and they passed for several minutes, continuuing NW. I have recorded what I could with my cell phone.  Moments after seeing the first group of light, three more came passing by, nearly following the path of Hwy 5.  They were relatively low, with no sounds as that which an aircraft would make. We did call our local police dispatch number to see if there were other reports of sightings, checking to see if the! re was a military operation going on, or something similar. The dispatcher basically dismissed my call.  My friend and neighbor both saw the lights I saw. I have a background in Aviation as well as majored in Environmental Science with a focus on Climatology/Paleo-Climatology.  The lights were not like lights one would see from solar flares, I have seen solar flares in the past.  They were moving horizontally.  The Wind was SSE 18G, 23MPH. This is from the NOAA Website for Portland, OR - nearest location:  Winds Aloft Forecast - PDX 1616 1827-05 1931-12 2034-17 2140-31 2262-45 227955 226355 215453   In researching who to contact as I realized this was not a normal occurrence here, I found your website, where to my amazement, I also found the pilot&#39;s report from our same basic geographic location.  I am not sure what to think. We often have low flying helicopters fly over, following that path as well as planes, but these things were not either planes nor helicopters.  There was a very slight breeze, and I don&#39;t believe them to be the floating lanterns which have become popular, as the trajectory path was consistent, low, and moving NW, against the SSE Winds. They appeared to come from the SE, over a mountain range.<n>

I work around them everyday. While traveling down I-95 about 15 miles outside of Lumberton NC,  My passenger and I witnessed a long formation of white lights above horizon. Jokingly, we talked about an aircraft landing on the highway.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As we drew closer, the line of lights made me certain that these were no landing lights of any aircraft I have encountered.  As we traveled ever closer the lights formed into somewhat of a cross/disc shape with a bright light in each corner.  A single unflashing red light accompanied the center light.  The craft was angelic in its movements and seemed to hover at a speed at which no aircraft could maintain flight.  I would estimate its altitude at 200 feet.  I could make out the feint curvature of a hull between the lights. No sound was heard when I rolled down my windows.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At this point my passenger and I couldn&#39;t comprehend what we had just seen.  The craft passed over to the trees on the right of the interstate. I knew i needed to photograph the craft so I immediately took the exit a quarter mile from our sighting, but the craft was nowhere to be seen.  I know there were other witnesses.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I consider myself an extremely logical person but have no explanation for what was seen.  It maneuvered in a manner no earthly vessel can. The fact I witnessed this on the supposed end of the world might bring discredit to my story, but I know what I saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After finding this site, I noted a similar account of a craft in this area very recently.<n>

While waiting for my turn, I saw 9 orange lights in the distance coming at us from the SE horizon.  It looked like they were all traveling at the same speed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thinking that maybe they were planes waiting to land at Sky Harbor, we noticed they were NOT in formation, they were orange and the other moving objects in the sky were planes.  These 9 objects were not planes and appeared as orange lights, shape unknown.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then suddenly one light just blinked out, then another, and another until they were all gone.  My son was able to capture these lights on his cell phone camera and recorded each light as they went out. I can send it to you, if you want.<n>

She turned around and went back towards the direction of where the objects were.  By this time, the objects were now on her right side in the sky. The objects were low but above tree lines. She pulled into a neighborhood and saw 3 similar orange balls in a triangular formation. The objects then disappeared.  She drove forward to see if the objects had moved but did not see anything.  She called me on my phone at this time. I was around 5 minutes from where she was and drove towards her.  She came back to where she was in the neighborhood and saw the objects again. This time there was a man in his car also looking at the objects. My wife asked this man if he was seeing the same thing and he said yes and that he just saw around 9 to 10 objects.  When I made it to where my wife was, there was nothing in the sky.  After waiting for 5 minutes we drove back towards our house.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On the way back, I looked to my left and saw 2 orange ball like objects in the distance above the tree line. One object looked bigger than the other. Both objects were bigger than anything in the sky but smaller than the moon. I turned around and drove towards the objects but could not spot them. While driving back, I was on a freeway overpass and saw orange lights on my left. I pulled over on the shoulder and saw four to five orange balls shoot up from the ground and disappear within seconds. The objects appeared to shoot up from the ground. The area was in the middle of a couple of TV towers. That was the last sighting.<n>

The objects appeared to be far away but our eyes can not judge distances and size without references.  The size appeared to be about that of a jet after takeoff from about two to three miles away.  All of the objects had the same shape, close to upside down u&#39;s.  Each had five lights of a bright red color.  They came from the norteast and rose from the horizon at an aproximately 45 degree angle untill they came to about the height of the tree lines.  We have 80 year old elm trees in milwaukee about 100 feet tall. They tenn proceeded to level off and move to the east.  They then leveled off. One followed another at a space of about one tenth of the northern horizon.  They were silent. Their angle of diaganol assent was constent and in a straight line and was slow, slower than a helicopter.  They were silent.  I flagged down several cars and four witnesses saw this.  They were scared and would not give me their names<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.  PD))<n>

As I was driving through the Sepulveda pass I noticed a bright white light.  I believed this to be a very bright star at first impression.  I noticed it moving very slowly from the West heading East over the freeway.  It moved slower than a plane or a helicopter would travel and then as I proceeded to start driving almost directly underneath I could tell then that there were actually two unidentified flying objects.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At this point in time now (approximately five minutes after my initial sighting) I could tell that there were two objects; one craft was distinctly triangular in shape and had a different colored light at each corner. One light was red, the other was green, and the other was a faint greenish/whitish color.  The lights were going off in an irregular pattern.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The other UFO was hard to look at, as the two white lights on it were so bright, I was not able to tell the space of the object itself.  Both of the UFOS were now absolutely stationary in the sky directly over the 405 freeway near Westwood.  They were not moving at all for approximately five minutes, and after that point my car had driven far too south on the freeway for this scene to still be in my view.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have never seen anything like this in my life.  I was able to see people coming out on their balconies in their apartments whom were also pointing at the sight I was seeing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke via telephone with the witness, and she sounded to us to be quite eloquent and sober-minded.

The reason I finally chose to report is, I wanted to be reassured of what I’ve seen and find out more info. I do believe in other worlds that are out of human reach.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I will only report the latest sighting, which was today December 21, 2012, at approximately 1:00 P.M. Pacific Standard Time, of three bright white sphere shaped objects at 309 NW degrees down town L.A.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As they hovered, they formed triangle shapes, and alignments, some were in straight lines, and then they would go around each other and form yet another triangle.  I have drawn a pattern of which they were forming. In the order they were formed and directions.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Finally, a darker (Golden Black) bright object (can’t quite describe its shape) showed in the middle of the formed triangle, and that’s when they stopped hovering, formed one last straight line.  Darker object started vanishing, followed by the three white bright objects, until became way too far to be visible.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Last but not least, it’s has always been a hypnotizing experience, where I can’t look away and my surroundings seem to have vanished.  Each of my sightings lasted about 6-10 seconds, yet it felt timeless.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thank you so much in advance.<n>

It was about 7:45am central time, and I was on freeway I-94 east looking at the sun rising when just to the left of the sun i saw a very bright &amp;quot;()&amp;quot; shaped object with a hollow center... It was extremely bright and vivid like a star.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first it was just outlines of that () shape which made me look closer because i have never seen anything like that with a &#34;hallow.&#34;  I was trying to see which direction it was moving, and it looked like it was heading up at first, but as i kept looking it was heading downwards which made me wonder if it was a meteorite or something that entered our atmosphere.  But as it got lower it turned from the original hollow “()&amp;quot; shape to a solid circle.  That’s when I knew it was something weird, because there was no jet stream behind it or anything... and then it kind of hovered in place, and looked like a bright star. It then got ! really small like it was going further away from me, and then grew bigger a few seconds later like it was getting closer again. It was moving in all different directions; up, down, left and right…I knew this because I was measuring the gap between the object and the sun. It was early, so the sun was not harsh on my eyes.  I wanted to call the police or something but didn’t know who to call.  The only explanation I could think of for it being the “()&amp;quot; shape when i first noticed it, was if it was going at super sonic speeds into our atmosphere, giving that effect from such a far distance... I did not take a picture because it was too far away and would have just looked like a white speck on my camera phone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides little contact information.

Living close to NASA and ELINGTON FIELD, I was used to seeing odd lights and aircraft.  I mentioned seeing something odd and as soon as I did, 2 additional orbs appeared creating a triangular shape.  I told my friend what I was seeing, he had doubts as did I.  A strand of 3 lights appeared to the left.  They rose quickly in a perfect line, and also took shape as a triangle.  The orbs in total were 6, brilliant and amber/orange in color.  They slowly turned and faced the south where they disappeared through the tree line.     I was in shock. I ran inside and woke my wife to tell her what I had seen.  I involuntarily frightened her, but asked her to come see with me. She decided to stay in bed, but I wanted to see more.  Still on the phone, I went back out and continued watching the tree linew in the same southern direction.  A total of 3 more times, orbs rose in the sky forming two large pyramid shapes. In all, I saw 24 orbs this morning.     I tried to record what I saw with my phone, but after coming inside, I realized my camera phone was facing the wrong way, so there was just darkness and the sound of my voice in the video. I&#39;ll never forgive myself. I know what I saw though and it was not candles or balloons in the sky. The patterns were too precise. The distance from me was 10 miles at most, and the orbs size and position only helped confirm the enormous size of each triangle that formed in the sky.     I will be sitting at my back door with a camera facing the right direction, precisely at 2 o&#39;clock tomorrow morning for another once in a lifetime chance to catch what I saw hovering quietly in the night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I hope that others thinking they saw something this night won&#39;t feel alone.

It was already past midnight, so I thought to myself (okay I will go have a last cigarette before I head off to bed.). So I stepped out of my front door that face&#39;s west and started to look at the moon as it was setting. Oddly my attention was pulled to the N.W. I saw a red light going toward the airport. I naturally thought it was a plane. Then I noticed there were no flashing lights.  I said aloud, &#34;Okay... Now I&#39;m watching you..&#34;<n> <n><n> <n><n> Once I had said that it changed from heading East to S.E. then to South.  It was heading towards me.  I stepped further out into the front yard to get a better look as it went above my house.  I quickly ran in woke up my father and grabbed a camera.<n> <n><n> <n><n> By the time I got back outside it was gone nowhere to be seen even from the roof.  Later a plane went by higher up then it was I could see the flashing lights on it and hear the sound as it passed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Description - Very bright red light 3 times bigger then any airplane or helicopter spotlight at the altitude it was traveling.  No noise emitted from the Craft.  Massive dark shape behind the red light.  Blocked out stars as it passed overhead. 5 times faster then any witnessed plane bomber jet (commercial/Fighter ). No tail/tracers from the light.  Single light 1/6 the size of craft.<n>

As I looked over at my clock it struck midnight all of a sudden the house felt like it was shaking.  There was a swishing noise almost sounded like a large object falling during that there was a bright light a reddish white color it grew brighter as the noise did.and then there was a boom my whole family jumped out of bed frightened they thought it was a asteroid or a bomb even .it sounded like the object had lost control and fallen.  within a second of the boom a helicopter landed and within the blink of an eye left as though it was just  cleaning what ever the object left behind.  Here are some strange facts other residents in the area reported sightings on that date in main parts of the city.  the landing zone was a residential yard on one of the main roads, no where near an airport.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

Scary<n> <n><n> <n><n> I must preface, I&#39;m somewhat nervous to have to explain something of this nature.  Never in a million years would I have thought it remotely possible in reality....<n> <n><n> <n><n> Last night my son and I were driving on hwy 36 around 11:30 on our way to my mothers house in Coppers Cove TX. In the distance we noticed a very bright flashing light.  My first thought was that it could be a plane, helcopter or a signal tower with unuasually bright lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We continued to watch it when suddenly it was RIGHT ON ABOVE of our SUV!  There are few words that will effectively relay to anyone that wasn&#39;t there just how large and utterly surreal looking this thing was.  It was shaped like an octogan with flashing lights on all sides.  It looked like a building floating in the sky. It had debth/structure to it that&#39;s hard to put into context.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was in shocked and as a mother I became fearful this thing could be a potential threat considering how close it was.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So I stepped on the gas to get a! way from it. I was driving way over the speed limit and not looking back when it occured to us to take a picture or video.  My son was in the back filming what was left of it at that point.  Both my son and I were just floored by what was happening.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;m extremely dissappointed we didn&#39;t think soon and capture the object in solid form.  When we first saw the object it was about 400 meters above us, close enough for us to realize its enormous size, hexagonal shape, and its grey/concrete color.<n> <n><n> <n><n> By the time my son had pulled out a camera and moved to the back of the vechile to film, it appeared to have distanced itself subtaintally from us, at least a few miles away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke via telephone with this witness, and she sounded to us to be very sincere and sober-minded.  We suspect that she is a highly reliable witness.  She also sounded quite emotionally shaken by her experience.  PD))<n>

I&#39;ve never believed in UFOs before in my life until last night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At 7:30pm me and my mom left Houston to drive to my grand parents ranch in Copperas Cove Texas. Along the drive around 11pm, Thursday, December 20th, we saw a pulsating bright light in the distance; the light would  change between completely bright and completely dark in 1 second intervals.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I noticed  it looked odd,  although at such a far distance it was hard to call it anything other than a plane. So I disreguarded it, and kept looking at the landscape.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Suddenly, I heard my mom shriek and I looked out the windshield to my upper left hand corner; what I saw almost looked completely unlike anything I&#39;ve ever seen before outside of movies.  A five to six sided hexagon looking ship was seemingly hovering almost directly above our vehicle.  Imagine sitting in the passenger seat and looking up to the left through the windshield, the object I saw was about the size of a gold dollar, so I am assuming it was no further then a half mile above our heads.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The only time you could see what it clearly looked like, is when it was iluminated, although it was hard because it was flashing in 1 second intervals like a strobe light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object was gray on the bottem and each corner of the shape had a light.  I could tell that the object wasn&#39;t skinny, it looked like a hotel in mid air, the size of it was jaw dropping.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As soon as the UFO was no longer in view outside of the windshield,  (Directly above us, but blocked by the material on the roof of the car), I grabbed my moms phone and crawled to the back of the car and began to film.  By this point it seemed as if it had covered a vast amount of distance.  Note that there were atleast 4-5 cars behind us on the same road.  The name of the road we were on is Highway 36 right outside of Cameron, Texas.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Even now I am having a hard time believing my eyes. The way it was moving was completely unlike anything I&#39;ve ever seen before. There was no noise, there also was trail of gas or any type of fuel in its wake.  Leading me to believe that it wasn&#39;t some massive oddly shaped plane flying at a low altitude.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Once again I never in my life have believed in alien technology or UFOs of any sort.  Attatched are zoomed in screenshots of the video I took, and a video. In Stevensville on December 19th there was a sighting and the video resembles mine almost exactly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke via telephone with both this young man, and with his mother.  Both of the two witnesses to the event struck us as being quite sincere, and quite sober-minded.  We suspect that both mother and son describe their experience quite sincerely, and honestly.  PD))<n>

I used my cell phone to look at google’s sky map of celestial arrangement of the planets on the historic evening , finding Jupiter and Orion, the Moon and Uranus quite visible in the sky.  Many stars very brilliant in the cold night.  I put away my cell phone , went inside and got shorts on for hot tub.  I returned to get in , and instantly was visually drawn to a magnificent light in the low sky just above the rooftop of my backyard neighbors.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Just above my neighbors rooftop I saw a bright brilliant magnificent blue light revolving on an object in the sky.  I tried to decipher what kind of craft it was immediately as I live near military base JBLM and see frequently, aircraft in sky, especially helicopters.  Instantly I started realizing this object was neither, by its unusual motion and the shape and changing colors!!  Its shape, as I focused, was that of an oval shape with a funnel bottom.  It moved quickly from right to left, faster than anything I’ve ever seen , pausing, then left to right, again pausing as it slowly moved farther away and lower in the skyline .It had a pendular curve to its motion also, back and forth.  All the while the most amazing light emanating from it, changing though, from blue to bright white.  But, this Light was Rectangular, pronounced along the length of the craft . I would say the craft was rotating its orientation rather than its lights changing , because it was constant, like white lights in front and blue in rear .<n> <n><n> <n><n> Suddenly , as I stared , I recalled a similar incident my wife witnessed nearly 3 weeks prior in the same location.  I broke site for a quick moment to yell in my house to my wife to come outside. I returned to viewing object , trying to decipher more about its make up , seeing more clearly its shape , and realizing more and more this was not aircraft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My wife did not make it out in time to see as it disappeared on horizon beyond rooftops . this happened approximately within 7 minutes I’d guess.  I instantly told her what I witnessed questioning it with what she had seen 3 weeks prior.  As we talked we confirmed each others sighting as the same thing.  We continued the next morning to discuss shape size and color, individually confirming each others belief of what we saw.  Because of this, I’ve decided I had to report in hopes others have seen, and that possibly, others will watch for more occurences as my wife and I are now interested in doing .<n> <n><n> <n><n> Also, I state that this is no way a Star !!!  It was a craft of some type, and upon viewing it, you would understand and agree easily.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thank you!<n>

12/20/12 21:20|Johannesburg (South Africa)||Fireball|10 seconds|Large red/orange light moving fast over Johannesburg. Not an aircraft!|12/20/12|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/095/S95358.html|307|ndxe201212| Large red/orange light moving fast over Johannesburg. Not an aircraft!<n> <n><n> <n><n> First off, I have been working in the aviation industry for the past 12 years, so I know what an aircraft looks like. What we saw, was not an aircraft!  Further more, I have a keen interest in astronomy and often spend time star gazing, this was not a meteor fireball either!<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was standing outside having my evening cigarette, when I noticed a large (street light sized) light moving fairly fast (about 6-8 seconds to cover an arc stretching 20 deg off the horizon from the West to 30deg on the eastern horizon, 45 deg inclination) overhead.  I immediately called my wife and she then had a couple of seconds to observe the object as well.  We both agreed this is not something normal.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The light was closer to red than orange, flashing slightly in intensity but never disappearing. No sound accompanied the object.  The sky was mostly overcast, I would say 7/8 coverage with broken patches at various heights.  It seemed like the light was higher than the lower cloud base which I would estimate at 1000&#39; AGL (5&#39;500 AMSL) but still shone through.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Given the size of this fireball object, if it was an aircraft or helicopter, your would definitely have heard its engines. This thing w absolutely quiet.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Whilst watching the light pass, a commercial airliner passed overhead and we had a brief moment where we could directly compare the light to the aircraft.  The crew in that aircraft must have seen it too! The lack of sound from the light was in complete contrast to the sound of the aircraft passing.  You could clearly make out the shape of the aircraft as well with the various navigation lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The light moved from the East towards a Western direction in an arching line, then out of sight behind tree cover.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I swear, I&#39;ve never seen anything like this before! Yes, logically the red port light of an aircraft would fit the angle we were seeing this object, but it does not account for the size of it nor the manner in which it shone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The best way to describe it, is like a ever so lightly flashing meteor fireball on a clear sky without the distinctive tail and accompanying bits breaking off from ablation.<n>

The color of the light was a very very pale amber, but I couldn&#39;t discern any clear shape.  I would estimate it was two or three times the size of Venus at its biggest and brightest.   I did not hear any aircraft or unusual noise.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The light continued very bright for a minute or two, and appeared to move very slowly straight upward (compared to fixed points on some telephone poles and nearby mountains) during this time.  Then it faded to a small dot of the same color in about 8 seconds, but then grew bright and big again.  It stayed bright for about another minute, then again faded into a small dot that this time vanished entirely.<n> <n><n> <n><n> However, I could make out one or two very dim red lights in the same place, and these lights began to move smoothly faster, at a speed that one might expect or a small aircraft or helicopter, heading due West at the same altitude, in between the clouds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I lost sight of the lights when the headlights of a car came around a bend in the road.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The temperature was about 48 degrees, wind was very calm, the moon was bright enough that it was easy to see shadows and objects.  There were a few low, thin clouds in the sky and the light seemed to be in the midst of them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object lacked any flashing lights and made no noise that I could detect.  This area has mountain ranges to both the east and west, and it&#39;s easy to hear planes or helicopters flying between them at low altitudes, even from some distance, as the noise reverberates.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is my third sighting of a potential UFO in this area;  the other two sightings were in the fall of 2010.  I go outside with the dogs two or three times a night, and, since 2010, always look carefully for anything out of place in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Since 2010, I&#39;ve only seen one other oddity until tonight, and that was a bright but not extraordinarily bright object that hung in the sky in apparently fixed position for about 10 minutes, but then I heard what sounded like a sudden loud jet noise and saw a jet with flashing lights nearly pass over my house at low altitude and head due South.  I wondered at the time if that particular jet might be a Harrier-like aircraft doing reconnaissance for the Defense Department or Border Patrol, given this area is close to the border with Mexico.  Tonight&#39;s object was much, much bigger and brighter, and I never heard any noise, or saw anything that resembled a jet, airplane, or a helicopter.<n>

At this point, it looks more like a star.  Perhaps the light on the horizon went away, when I changed rooms?<n> <n><n> <n><n> I went back to the other room where I sat watching it, and it was no longer there at 2330.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I watched the light earlier thinking it to be a helicopter, but it sat there all night.  I do see lots of airplanes coming off that horizon, but it stayed too stationary to be an airplane.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;ve watched a similar light in the direction of southeast of Mt Rainier over Puget Sound just on the horizon previously.  This light was there night after night after night a month or so ago.<n>

Of course I turn to my window to actually see what it is and well there are 3 cone shaped lights spinning in a full circle then then all meet in the center about every three or four seconds, in the center how ever is yet another light that is dimmer than the others.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The event is actually still going on as I type this, no sound or anything.  Funny thing is this is not my first encounter with this about two months ago there was a single spinning light that resembled what a medalion would look like if spun it always followed the same path at the same height.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Even before that how ever me and some friends saw what appeared to be to be like a Phoenix in the sky then it simply disappeared as some planes came by its loaction, not long after it randomly appeared again before rising steadily and disappearing in a flash.<n>

We came up on top of this big hill and we looked out on the horizon and saw this silver object in the air.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am really not sure on how to describe the shape of it.  It was silver in color and the sun was reflecting off from it.  It seemed that the object was traveling fast and it was not too high up in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As we were traveling west it disappeared because of the trees but then it reappeared again when the area was free of trees and you could see the shape a little better.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I would describe it as halving a dome shape with a round flat surface going around it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object then disappeared and we did not see it again.<n>

The object seemed to periodically reflect sunlight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The vehicle in front of the one directly in front of me slowed down and was beeped at by the car behind them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As we continued we witnessed the object two more times, once at the foot of the hill by the mill and the second at the summit of that hill by Craft Auto.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object seemed to be traveling west up the river.  I would estimate it to be a mile and a half away at an altitude of between 2000 and 2500 feet.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The objects shape seemed oblong/oval during our first encounter but seemed to be disk like with an oval top much like a bee keepers hat at our second and third encounters.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The craft seemed to vary in speed as it traveled.  It was not close enough to trees to n! otice if any exhaust was displacing the trees.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There were no crafts on the water.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The time of the incident was 15:30 on December 20, 2012.  The sky was clear except for distant black clouds far on the horizon which was not near the sighting.<n>

She looked accross the street to the elementary school, and said she could see what she thought was spaceships.  The next day my daughter was at school, and her friend told her he was walking outside of the high school that same day, and saw 2 spaceships.  I have a pic to prove, what they saw.<n>

We began to go up the hill toward the town of Le Grand I saw a flash of light then another on the south side of the highway.  It was a bluish green; it seemed to be coming from the little town.  I thought it was fire trucks coming to the aid of the semi driver.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I saw another flash as we came to the top of the hill, no fire trucks.  Another flash, then I thought lightning or a transformer had blown up.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As we came past the town there was nothing.  I didn’t know what to think.  We continued to travel home there was another flash of the greenish blue light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had never seen anything like that light.  Wasn’t white like lightning.<n>

I noticed it first and asked, &#34;What is THAT?&#34;  It looked like a star at first but it was far too large and bright to be a star. It started in the NW part of the sky. The bright white light then turned red and streaked quickly towards us leaving a red trail in the behind it.  As decreased speed the red light faded.  Then it was very close and you could see it clearly.  The craft was an equilateral triangle with a large white light in the center and beige/orange lights in each corner.  There was a blue light on top.  It was only maybe 30-50 feet corner to corner.  It traveled east slowly and continuously toward, and then over us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The sight was so fantastic and we thought no one would believe what we were seeing. So we each pulled out our phones and tried to take a picture.  His phone shut itself off when he opened the camera application, and then mine froze up when I unlocked the screen then shut itself off shortly after.  That only added to the mystery of the experience.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The craft was only maybe 500 ft away when it was directly above us.  We never heard a sound the entire time we saw it.  The craft flew over the house so we ran around following it so we wouldn&#39;t lose sight of the most amazing thing we&#39;ve ever seen.  Finally it disappeared behind the trees across the street leaving us flabbergasted.<n>

Jumped out of bed, ran to window and could only see the light illuminating the yard and the crackling/buzzing noise.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I tore through the house  to get boots, coat and flashlight and froze in my tracks.  I’m afraid of the dark.  HAD to go.  Trucking threw the snow to get to the side of house that sits closely to the neighbors, I really expected to find one of our homes on fire.  There was nothing!<n> <n><n> <n><n> Went back inside and was not comfortable with the &#34;Nothing Found&#34; answer.  Called 911 right around 4 a.m.  Met two firefighters in the street.  They were walking with their flash lights pointed upwards with the fire truck following close behind them.  We went up to the side of the house and back yard checking for electrical issue, fire or something.  They pointed out that I had no electrical poles in the backyard (my backyard neighbors live on Cottage Grove across from Washington High School).  Ours come from across the street in front, but my neighbors connects to the side of house that had the issue.  No burn marks and they do not see any arcing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They left, I go back in, go to work, describe my 3:45 a.m. experience to co-workers and we then decide it was aliens.  J<n> <n><n> <n><n> After arriving home around 3 p.m., a co-worker forwards your article to me.  Too funny.  I, too live on the S.E. side of town, but it was 30 min. later.  Hmmmm.  Electrical or alien?  You decide.<n> <n><n> <n><n> If I had thought it was a UFO, I sure the hell would not have gone outside and I would have peed my pants!!!   Will we ever know for sure?    J<n>

I was in a black car. the object has never followed me in the red car, also I have seen the same thing just flying about 10,000 following firework smoke an after the boston terror thing I noticed there was a golden ball that day flashing ! from gold to red it was going up ames street west bound.If u watch the sky you see them all the time I have seen them going in every direction alot of the time they don&#39;t even stop they just fly right over my head one time we were walking an a ufo flew right over head from west to east. I can say Ive seen them go every direction. I think they watch or mess with the people who don&#39;t believe because now that I believe there&#39;s something else out there they don&#39;t bother me any more.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Oh an I was the one that said I say a ufo above the tree in the back yard I forgot to say mark that the reason I noticed the ufo was mainly because I think my dogs were barking at it or at least they were barking towards the ufo I belive the ufo&#39;s are portals that aliens can enter our world threw an or they are camera&#39;s so they can see where to block the sun but they obvious like to mess with people some times if i think about them I will see a real bright gold right on top of my neighbors house then! when I look it disapaers. I also noticed that the day all of ! the star s were falling, there were the 2 that are always there an all of the sudden both of the balls of light went the opposite direction an diapered. that same day I went out west an saw a silver ball not far off the ground flashing from silver the dark or so you couldn&#39;t see it. It was flying around then disapered. I am always watching for activity. I think I would have seen alot more but I never knew about ufo&#39;s untill 4 years ago.<n>

Low in the sky I saw at first 2 very bright orange balls.  They seeded almost like they were attached in some way. I thought at first of headlights on a low airplane.  After getting into an area that had less trees I saw 4 orange balls.  The other 2 were close to each other like the first looking almost connected.  All 4 of them each had a faint short trail of what looked like smoke on the top of them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I called my parents that live a few miles up the road from where I was at, and they saw them as well.  As I was traveling up the road toward the lights, a car in front of me pulled over to the side and parked, (this was on a back road with no houses or driveways in sight).  I proceeded to my parents house and  picked them up and we drove a little further up the road to a place that was a bit clearer.  Each one of the balls slowly fizzed out one bye one.  The just slowly got dimmer until you couldn&#39;t see them any more.  There was not any sound that we could hear from them, and the entire occurrence lasted for about 10 minutes total.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke via telephone with the witness, and he sounded to us to be objective and sober-minded.

It was somewhere between 7:15pm and 7:25pm.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A very large, and white colored glowing object appeared in the sky, seen from the truck my father and I were in. The object was larger than a full moon, but gave off an illumination similiar to what a star looks like in the night sky.  The object was to the south.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As soon as the object appeared it started traveling to the right (to the west).  It looked as if the object was at an elevation somewhere where an airplane might fly.  The object was moving at very fast speed, and using both of my arms to make an angle, it continued traveling westward for about 4 seconds, making roughly a 20 degree angle from where i was sitting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At the end of its movement, a thin orange streak shot out of the east side of the object.

Often at my house, since there is a clear view of the sky, I look up and hope to see a shooting star.  On clear nights I often do.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So standing outside my friends home I decide to do the same.  I&#39;m looking south and up to Orion&#39;s Belt.  I tilted my head back a little to see above me and I see many objects whizzing around.  The objects are red-orange in color and about twice the size of a star but only a fraction of the brightness.   As bright as something on the edge of a street lights view.  The objects flew like insects fly with sharp and fast darting movements.  The objects were moving quickly and as they were moving around they also all started moving south in direction and within two seconds had formed a large V shape consisting of about 7 red orange objects and a line of 3 following on the left side.  There were no streaks as shooting stars.  There was no sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The formation of red orange lights continued what seemed now seemed slowly but smoothly on a southern course gaining height and flying towards Orion&#39;s Belt.  I did not look away, I reached for my phone to record video not looking away at all, but it did not load until the objects were out of view.  My friend showed up the literal second they disappeared.  I was still staring up in the sky and I yelled for him to come and look.  By that time the objects in the sky were gone.  What I saw tonight on Long Island...a place I grew up on, I have never seen the like of in the sky.   I am a religious person. I work in the music and food industry, I fish and do things we all do. I know what I saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I will never forget those 10 seconds of my life.  It is now one of my biggest memories.  It is unsettling to me, however; I am a person of truth and I would like to know what exactly the red-orange luminescent bodies flying in the sky in formation above our heads are.  Thank you for your time.<n>

At approximately 7:30 pm on 12/18/12 in the Saylorville area north of Des Moines, Iowa, I was a passenger in car heading only north.  We had a 3 block run to the east when I looked up and noticed 5 lights appearing to be heading west.  Initially they looked like they maybe a helicopter squadron heading toward Camp Dodge.<n> <n><n> <n><n> hey appeared to be between 10 – 15 miles out.  I told the driver to pull over so he could witness them too.  All of a sudden they appeared to rearrange their pattern to a circle and their lights would dim appear more distant.  They really displayed odd behavior if they were military craft.  Secondly I didn’t notice any strobes or port/starboard lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We observed them for several minutes and the driver made a call back to the house to have our Christmas party guests witness them too.  Both the driver and myself were very “freaked” out by the unusual flight patterns…if it was a hoax it was well done…and although I’m very careful about saying I’m a believer in UFO’s, I am very adamant having served 26 years in the military, that these lights were somehow controlled by some average Joe citizen.  I have never seen such a sight in person…the driver and I both were flabbergasted the rest of the evening by what we witnessed.  I swear others in the community would have witnessed such a sight and have video of it.  It’s just simply unexplainable.<n>

At first we thought they were planes because we get a lot of air traffic over us.  After watching these two crafts for about a minute we both realized they were not planes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The front craft appeared as a blinking light.  The second which was following close behind was two solid lights with a blinking one in front making a rather squashed triangular shape.  At first we assumed the second craft was a plane with wingtip lights.  But there was no sound, and it appeared to be flying very high.  For it to be a plane it would had to have been much larger than any planes we currently use.  The second craft appeared to be chasing the front one.  The front craft was keeping a steady pace towards the west, whereas the second craft would slow to a complete stop in mid air before resuming and getting right back to the same distance from the first.  This is what stood out at first. After a few minutes of this behavior the second craft came to a complete stop once again, but this time it turned in the air about 45 degrees.  Watching the lights on what I’ll call the wingtips and the flashing light in front we could clearly see it turning while stopped.  It did this a few times, turning south then back to the west before turning south finally and slowly flying off and disappearing before it reached the horizon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As this was occurring the first craft continued west but at a slower pace.  Once the second craft was gone the first craft’s light stopped blinking and became a very bright solid light.  This solid light would last for about 10 seconds before it would dim back to the blinking light. It did this about 2 times before another aircraft came into view from the west, at which point the first craft started to turn back towards the east.  It did the solid light to blinking light one more time then disappeared from view as the aircraft from the west got close to it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This took place over the course of about 10 minutes, on 12/18/12, at 7:15PM.<n>

I have 2 coworkers that have seen the same thing.  I never told them what my grandma saw till they told me what they saw so I know they are not making it up to jive me.  BTW both coworkers saw the orange spheres on different occasions both over the Indian river while crossing the causeway.  I listen to coast to coast and I notice them talking about the red fireballs over Florida and other parts of the country I&#39;m convinced its the same phenomenon. I&#39;ve never seen them personally but I have seen stars that move in the sky.  I can tell the difference between airplanes and UFOs because airplanes have some light blinking on them.  UFOs traditionally don&#39;t.  These things look exactly like stars and move in str8 lines and sometimes make sharp turns. Iv never seen them shoot off or anything, so I could be seein satellites.  They appear everyday I wo! rk at Patrick Air Force base at the chow hall and rite when the stars come out if you look up for a good 10 mins you&#39;ll start to notice it. I&#39;ve shown other coworkers so this is not my eyes playing tricks. I see these star UFOs whenever I look up long enough at night time although I haven&#39;t been looking since early January. The orange spheres were 3 different occasions. This is not a joke I take this very seriously.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date is approximate.  PD))<n>

Walking with my friend, I noticed one person looking at the sky, so I also looked. Initially I saw two lights, seemingly burning orbs, flying absolutely silently across the sky in a perfectly straight trajectory.  As I watched, the leading orb was passed by the second one.  Then, both slowly died out, almost as if their &amp;quot;fire&amp;quot; had been extinguished.  Their speed across the sky was roughly equal to that of a commercial jetliner at cruising altitude and speed as observed from the ground.  The trajectory was roughly northeast to southwest.  As my friend assured me such lights were common, I saw more (perhaps as many as six more, in pairs or singularly) follow the same path in the sky with the same appearance and ultimate disappearance.  In all my years of watching the sky, observing planes, helicopters, myriad varieties of fireworks, meteors, and even satellites and rockets,  I have never seen anything comparable to these lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Since my friend insists these lights are a common occurrence, I will see if they appear this night (12/19/12) as well.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

It then appeared to hover or stand still until it moved off to the west at a high rate of speed and disappeared.<n>

No sound, and was nothing like those Chinese lanterns.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It flew as if it was real high, and then just like you would turn off a light switch. It just disappeared!   No slow fade of anykind.  Just diappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I live way back in the mountains so I don&#39;t have to worry with a lot of street lights.   I see stars with ease!  This thing was strange as to how it disappeared, and how it flew so slow!   I&#39;ve never seen anything like it before.<n>

It was coming from southwest sky.  At first I thought maybe it was a fireball or comet or meteorite.  But it had no tail and did not burn out.  It kept moving across the sky, right overhead and then proceeded to the eastern sky.  It was completely silent and moved slowly, enough time for me to yell out to my neighbors and have them too, witness this unusual event.  We all concluded it must be UFO.  It finally started to get smaller and appear to move outwards disappearing beyond the clouds.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I saw an orange light in the sky  traveling from left to right.  Then the clouds  cleared up a little, and as the clouds were  blowing away I saw many blue lights in the same  shape as the first orange one.  They were shaped  like dragonflies.  They were all traveling  towards the same general direction.  Finally the  clouds cleared  completely back and the sky was  full of these blue and orange lights up way too  high to be a plane, more up where the stars  were, traveling a little faster than a plane  would up.  They were in the shape of  dragonflies. I thought to myself why would so  many planes be flying so close together in the  same direction. Some were higher some lower but  all seemed to be going the same way. They got  close but never touched each other but kept a  distance apart.  After a few minutes they  disapeared.  Nobody was near me the exact time  it happened but I stood there for about 20  minutes afterwards and nothing else happened.  I  don&#39;t know how nobody else saw these lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;m sure there were other people out there at  the time, in and out of the store on their cell  phones with carts full of groceries and kids,  no one looking at the sky too absorbed in their  own worlds getting there groceries and getting  back home as fast as possible.  Nobody even  glancing up except to give me a funny look for  just standing there by myself looking up at the  sky.  A few people stopped to ask if I was ok as  I was standing there afterward.<n>

In Delray Beach, Florida on Monday, December 17,2012, when  I saw a bright orange light approaching from the west and heading straight east.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first I momentarily thought it was fireworks, then when it kept moving through the sky I thought it might be part of the meteor display I had been told about.  But the light kept coming steadily and really didn&#39;t seem like a meteor.  Next I thought it might be a helicopter with a bright search light.  But as it came closer there was no helicopter noise.  And then I thought it was a plane on fire.  I was horrified.  But it kept moving at the same speed and did not change direction.  It passed completely over and I watched it go east  over the Atlantic Ocean.   This took about 2 minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I turned back to the west to get out of the pool and was astounded to see another flaming ball approaching from the west following in the same path as the first going at exactly the same speed.   I could still see the first orange red fireball and watched as the second one silently followed the first out over the ocean.  They appeared to stay at exactly the same height.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I gradually lost sight of the first one and then lost sight of the second about 2 minutes later.  The total time seemed to be about 5 minutes.  At first I thought they might have been military experiments.  But after some cursory research,  I suspect they are pieces of space debris still in orbit but on fire.  Seeing as there are hundreds of thousands of pieces of space debris out there, this makes the most sense.  Especially given their straight path and steady speed.  What do you think?<n>

This is about 16miles from the downtown Chicago and they were only about 1,500-2,000’ (lower?) (I am an architect with no flying experience…). They were silent, moving from North directly South and changed color from red to orange and back again. The speed was pretty much like a steady news-helicopter-very steady yet not speedy. The silence was obvious. They were sizable enough and ovoid enough to get my attention while on a call with a client.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They remained about a ¼ mile (perhaps a bit more) apart the whole time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was on Dempster Avenue headed East and turned South onto Austin Avenue, stopped, got out of my car to get a better look.  It was eerie and this would have to be my first legitimate UFO siting of my life!  My wife, angered at the risk of my stopping, was a witness (though she remained in the car).<n>

It was orange with some yellow color in it flickering brighter then dimming in a stationary position for about 8 seconds.  Then the object started to move to the south very slowly, still circular in form but getting brighter in intensity.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As the object continued to the south it dipped down about 5 degrees very quickly continuing at the same slow pace south bound as before.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then three slow out of time blinking lights appeared on the outside of the object, pulsing off and on but not like a planes lights blink.  Then the bright orange, yellowish center of the object went out and just the little blinking lights remained.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The craft continued south bound very slow and then dissapeared, not because it was too far to see but just vanished.  This all took place over a span of about 15 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My family always watch the skies at night and in the daytime.  We have a mare than basic understanding of fundemental sciences and other related topics.

I cant figure this one out using normal logic.<n>

As we were leaving the house carrying stuff to the car we got about 25 feet away from the door and something caught my eye.  I looked up saying “what is that”  and me and ((woman&#39;s name deleted)), my fiancé, saw what looked like a fireball colored light in the sky.  I watched it and realized that there was no trail that something burning up in our atmosphere would have.  Just an orange and yellow light.  It took maybe two seconds to travel from the southern horizon to  right in front of us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Once it was directly in front of us it was about 7x the size of a star as apposed to the 4x it was over the southern horizon.  It had a tilt resembling the tilt a helicopter would have flying forward but had no flashing lights and was not white green or red.  And almost look like the side of a saucer.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I ran back to get her sister, which took about five seconds ((name deleted)) put the stuff by the car and walked out to the street to watch the light.   When I came back and stood with her in the street the light had moved it was now over the northern horizon and shrinking in size.  Total it took the light 10 to 20 seconds to go from horizon to horizon.  The object then began to brighten and disappear almost pulsating from nothing to a bright light for about 5 minutes and then stopped and nothing was to be seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Honestly I can say that not only was I excited to see a ufo, my first sighting in my life, but I had an uneasy feeling the whole time I was watching it almost like the feeling of a frightened cornered animal.<n>

I was looking up towards the houses on this street, all the lights looked really nice, when i saw the moon. it was really bright, and just following on the side of me in the sky, that&#39;s why i assumed it was the moon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> You know how the moon follows you when your driving or it appears to follow you. so i thought it was. i was doing about 25 mph when i had to slow down for the light.  I am waiting at the light to change to green, when i look up through my windshield and there&#39;s the moon again now right infront of me.  I am stairing at it, and all of a sudden there&#39;s two lights instead of the one light. which i was like wow..  OK it&#39;s a plane then. cause there&#39;s no way i just saw it divide.  I honestly thought my eyes were playing tricks, cause of the christmas lights and decorations all around. the trees right next too my car as i sit idel at the light are only about 30 or 40 feet high.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then I am thinking i am in the city, and i don&#39;t think planes can be that low. next thing i notice as i am sitting there, i look up again and it&#39;s lower and there&#39;s three lights in a perfect triangle shape.  Now my heart is raising and i am searching through my purse looking for my iphone to take a picture.  The light changes and i move forward swing a left into a side store parking lot, spin around in my car and i am facing it, and it&#39;s about 50 feet off the ground right infront of me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am looking at this blacker than black, triangle shaped object, there&#39;s three lights and they are so bright, but look just like a star shaped. as i switch my ipone to camera and i am looking at this object it just vanished.  I didnt see it go up i didn&#39;t see it go to the left or right it was just gone, in a nano second.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have seen objects in the sky, crafts i couldn&#39;t explain since i was about 6 years old. this one was so different. I felt so different. I felt connected in some way, and then i felt excited and ill. and as i sit here typing this, i still am having trouble believing what i saw and how close it was.

We have 3 skylights facing north-west.  He said he saw something go by the skylight.  I thought, at first, that he was talking about a fly in the room or something.  He said it was a yellow object but was going too slow to be a plane. That&#39;s when I saw them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I got out of bed, very agitated, and looked out all the skylights.  Truly, my first thought was that they were UFO&#39;s because I had never seen anything like it before.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I went downstairs in the dark as I didn&#39;t want to draw attention to myself to the, so I thought, UFO&#39;s.  I went to my slider looking into my backyard to get a better look.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What I saw were circular objects that looked like yellow/orange fireballs larger than a bright star but smaller than a full moon.  They were traveling from my right to my left at about a 45 degree angle in height.  They were traveling in sets of 3 in a triangular formation.  I probably saw 9 of them.  I said, &#34;They just keep coming!&#34;<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I was looking at them, I called 911 to report what I was seeing.  Then I told the dispatcher I had to get my binoculars to see what the heck they were.  I was able to see them thru my binoculars, but I didn&#39;t see anything different than what I was seeing with my naked eye/no other shape or form.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The sighting lasted about 3 minutes or so.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Still agitated, I went back upstairs to bed.

Then they disappeared one at a time. the first one up dissapearing first then the second and then the third and so on.  If I had to compare the size I would say about the size of a vw bug.  It&#39;s hard to say because of the distance and the bright glow and of course I was very excited.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was waving my arms at them and there was just one left in the sky and just before it disappered it flashed. and my husband/ boyfriend said wow it flashed at you.  I was so tripping on it .  I tell you,  it was great. There is no way this was a lantern or anything like that. the movments were percise and intentional.  There was no sound from these crafts at all. silent.  It was raining outside not very hard at the time.<n>

I have thought that I have seen UFO&#39;s before but never as clearly as this sighting.  I was driving north on highway I95 near the Waltham exit and directly in front of me up to my right in the sky I saw a blue spherical object streak across the sky at about a 45 degree angle and disappeared before it reached the horizon without any sort of debris breakup.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first I thought it was a shooting star or a meteor, but it was larger than any meteor or shooting star that I have ever witnessed, about half the size of a full moon.  It had a very long brilliant blue streak behind it, and its proximity to the earth&#39;s surface appeared to be much closer than any type of shooting star or meteor that I&#39;ve ever witnessed.  The object was visible for about 3-5 seconds before it disappeared.<n>

Two witnesses.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was a little past 9 pm, late December of 2012.  Me and a good friend were walking though our small town.  My friend is a skeptic of this sort of thing. All of a sudden he slows a down to stop and says, &#39;look at that&#39;. I looked up, and could barely process what I had just seen. It was a massive, bright, white, and fast moving object. Rectangular in shape. And moving at hundreds of mph!  One of the many things that hit me about this craft, was it appeared to be moving right over our town, and low, at an unimaginable speed, yet it never made one sound. I would say it was the size of a football field, at least.  And then it just disappeared into the clouds. I tried to ask my skeptic friend why couldn&#39;t this by some plane, (even though I pretty much knew what it had to be). He said, &#39;um because it was going a million mph&#39;!! One thing is for sure, I will never forget that night.<n>

Just being in his room for a couple of minutes we both automatically are drawn by the window by seeing a number of lights i can not remember the exact amount but it was definately more than 3 it was like a formation which actually i remember that it at first glance it was in a line horizontilly shaped but then as it moved it was going in to a 4 or 5 sphere then moving again in a boxed like shape so ultimately id say about 4 or 5 lights which changed shape from being big to small, big to small it was so bizare! the lights did eminate but not strong enough that from a long distance someone wuld not be able to veiw it i dont think, it was the most strangest thing i have ever seen in my light. we first saw these lights up from the sky flashing lights of colours of, blue, green and red. but these lights appeared to come closer above our house and then closer to the window but within seconds of it being closer the only way i can describe it is it zaped away up into the sky then disapered.  And at that point of time i heard of UFO&#39;S but had never ever beleived in them until that happened it was so shocking to my eye that i new it was more than being just as normal instadent.  However, i do not really remember much after that at all i do know it was some time ago and at first i did think it was maybe there was a explanation but i could and cannot find a resonable normal one at all..<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

It was between 18:00-19:00 in the evening, with a clear sky.  Looking to NNW, we saw two ‘fireball’ structures flash through the night sky momentarily (for approximately 3 seconds).  They were ‘falling’ vertically, as if they were meteorites.  However, I have seen several meteorites (3 over 3 years) while living here, and these were slightly different as I did not immediately identify them as such.  We both saw them, and did not have an immediate explanation.<n> <n><n> <n><n> One was slightly larger, primarily white with orange around the edges (no streaking tail) and the other showed up almost simultaneously a short distance down and left of the original structure.  This one was slightly more orange, also with no tail.  They fell through the sky for a short second and disappeared.  They were ill-defined, as if glowing, whereas most meteorites I have seen have clearly defined margins.  I have never seen 2 simultaneously, and all others I have seen have a streaking tail as they fall through the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am not sure if we saw meteorites or not, but I was intrigued when I heard Peter Davenport on Coast to Coast speaking of increased fireball sightings- otherwise I would not have thought twice about it.  I am a graduate student and my friend is a veterinarian working on her PhD- we are both educated people, and educated observers.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I went outside and witnessed at first 14 or so ORANGE colored lights kind of staggered over a mile or so in the air.  They were all headed in a western direction and then faded out.  After the first group faded out, one last one trailing came in to view and faded out as well.  When I say they were staggered, I mean there was no relative shape to these lights, only one light after the other. Above and below each other as well.  Of note, there was no sound produced from these craft or we were too far away to hear any power source coming from these things.  We have watched the news last night and today hoping to hear what it is we observed but have heard nothing from the news or on the internet.  We did not have a chance to get a camera even though I had one in my work truck,  I wish we had though.<n>

I saw a bright orange sphere come from the east.  I saw it through the trees as it broke the plane of my tree line.  It was a bright vivid orange color. It slowly changed directions and curved to the left.  It was a gradual change in direction. It followed the top of my tree line as clear as could be. then it slowly changed direction again toward the west and eventually passed below my tree line.   I estimate this object to be about 3-7 miles away, it was hard to tell.  The way it moved was very smooth almost gliding like...no speratic shifts or jerking..  For as far away as it was, it still had a good size to it.  There was no wind outside and it was absolutely silent.  I am 40 years old.  I would consider myself a skeptic to things like this.  I am not saying that it was an alien life form, but I am  saying that is was nothing like I had ever seen and I could not even begin to guess at what it could have been .  I am interested to see if anyone else saw what I saw last night.<n>

It slowed down and stopped completely then it seriously went invisible.  It had 2 small glowing orange circles on it.  And one by one they flickered and it dissapeared.  Then reappeared stayed stationary for a couple seconds and then took off faster than possibly anything on this planet.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About 2 minutes afterwards we were still in that &#34;shock and awe&#34; state and another one appeared on the exact same path.  I pulled my phone out hit record and it flickered but stayed on and shot off in another direction at &#34;warp&#34; speed...  It did a j pattern in the air.

Aircraft taking off from Reagan National Airport fly north to south in this part of the sky, but they&#39;re close enough to identify the airline and could not be mistaken for anything else; the object observed appeared farther away (perhaps southeast of Washington), made no sound, and moved essentially toward the airport before stopping and fading away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;m also aware of the meteor shower--if this was a meteor it was travelling extraordinarily slowly (being visible for about a minute and appearing motionless for a time).<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was no trail.

As i mentioned it to her i realized that the lights were not blinking.  There were three bright white lights on the bottom of the object.  The bottom was shaped like a triangle.  The object was very low and flying slow. We were following it, and it stopped over a golf coarse and hovered for a few seconds.  This gave me a good side view. It seemed that it curved up from opposite sides on top.  There was also a red light on top near the back.  Soon the object moved and it was headed towards the Potomac River.  We got onto a road that moved parallel with the object, it stayed low over the river but then it came back our way and also got higher.  I drove the opposite direction and it stayed behind the whole time. I pulled over and got a picture and video, but all you see is the lights, no detail of the object.  Then I had to drive my girlfriend home, which was about 15 minutes north o! f our location.  On our way we passed an open area with no trees and saw the object high up and moving north faster than before.  It was noticeably bright, easily the brightest thing in the sky.  As we got to her house I saw the object pass by very fast and it was going north.  As it went by i realized how massive it was.  It looked almost like a cigarette at the speed it was moving.<n>

After pulling away from Grand Turk and Caicos, were sitting out on our balcony looking up at the night sky when all of the sudden a gold-ish tan egg shaped object flies from above the ship (directly above our balcony) towards open ocean.  I watch it for a moment trying to figure out what it was when I finally say &amp;quot;what the hell is that?&amp;quot; My husband looks and says &amp;quot;It&#39;s a satellite&amp;quot; I say &amp;quot;That&#39;s not a satellite - it&#39;s too low and close and it&#39;s not lit up... All of the sudden - right in front of us, it STOPS and zips straight back to the ship (right in front of us but a little above us) - then darts back to where it originally stopped and darts back to the ship again about half the distance it just did - darts back again to where it originally stopped, paused, and then continued on it&#39;s original path. We were able to follow it until it disappeared due to dark! ness. My husband and I looked at each other saying &amp;quot;DID YOU SEE THAT???&amp;quot; Totally amazing. Pretty cool.  The object was not lit up, but the lights off the boat and the strong reflection off the water lit it up fine) It was a definite gold color, but when it stopped to come back to us, it&#39;s color was more of a dull white and seemed to have a vibration blur to the edges of it. When it finished darting around and went back to it&#39;s original point of travel, it became clear again (without a vibration blur on the edges) and carried on it&#39;s way. Our stateroom was high up on the ship and I would say it was traveling at a height that seemed a couple of floors above us.<n>

Suddenly the object turn around unexpectedly  going  north of the LIE, when it turns we saw like 2 lines of lights in a very bright blue and red.  The object move further north and then it came back again. Looks like it was just playing in the sky.   I was still driving but my daughters keep looking at it until we were gone.   We wonder what is that?  Is it an experiment from the government?   It looks leery comfortable in the area. Like is not even trying to hide.<n>

Three of them are in my Masters program in Athletic Training at Saint Louis University;  Two were my neighbors, and one was my fiance.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Four of us, me and my 3 classmates, were laying on the concrete saw the object flying North to South.  I pointed to it the same time a second person next to me saw the object.  Two others on the concrete saw it as well, making it four observers, including myself (all in my Masters program).  It had no lights.  It did, however, have 3 visible circles in a triangular pattern, and a faint fourth circle in the back, making a diamond shape.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The circles looked like, what I would describe, a suction cup.  They were dark on the edges, become lighter towards the center, and were darkest in the center.  It gave the appearance like these circles, we were seeing were cone-like, and we were seeing them from below the cone, from wide end to the tip. What could be seen on the object was only due to the reflection of the city.  It was flying at a medium speed at a lower level from North to South.  It left no trail behind the object.  There was also no sound. We had it in view for about 45 seconds.  I&#39;m assuming it was a lower level because of the reflection of the city lights off its exterior.  What I found most intriguing was that there were no lights on the object as a plane would have on its wings.  There were no red or white lights. The only colors we could make out were shades of gray.  There was only one object.   We tried to get the other three people with us to see the objects, so we stood up, and pointed at it.  However, we lost it in the street lights as our eyes adjusted to the lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As we went upstairs, I drew a picture of the object and asked the others if it was what they saw.  All three observers exclaimed, &#34;YES! That&#39;s EXACTLY it!&#34;  We did not feel threatened by it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It is important to note that each of us had had two drinks each, but were under the legal limit to drive safely.<n>

It continued to sound in short blasts of first one, and then three &#34;trumpets.&#34;   Each &#39;blast&#39; lasted from 3-6 seconds and could be physicaly felt as well as heard, it also caused both of my cats to run and hide under my bed for the next half hour or so.<n>

At times it just looked like a small red light and other times it would have a full circle glare, then it looked similar to airplaine wings on the sides, then a tail like a comet.  It was fast moving and made a lot of small circles, hovered side to side, and made a lot of zig zags.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have never seen a UFO and didn&#39;t truly believe in them until we saw it last night.  We got a little scared but it never did anything.

It was disk shaped and it had white lights around it and a red line of lights on the side.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was moving sideways towards us really slow.  We thought it was a plane since we stay by Fort Bragg but it was moving really slowly so we started to drive down the road to see what it was and it was close to us and started moving really fast.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It went so fast that it disappeared so we stopped where we were and turned off the lights and then it reappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When we tried to follow it again it disappeared and we did not see it again.<n>

I noticed no physical form, and the lights were orange.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first I assumed geese reflecting light, but the shape was too perfect and un-changing.  I discovered that I could not take pictures with my phone while on a call the hard way, disconnected the call, and found that as I fumbled with the camera controls it had disappeared.  The only other detail I noticed was a strange quiet, but this could have been an effect of the shock of the moment.  The object made no sound. I could not surmise the size of the object, or be sure of its solidity, but it appeared large. With my arm outstretched, it was about the size of four of my fists.

We don&#39;t have a military base, and I&#39;ve never seen a plane this  low flying (Apart from airport) or triangular almost Ouija shaped.  I don&#39;t believe in aliens, but this was definitely an unidentified flying object(UFO).  It hovered in the sky without a sound.I thought because of the lights I could use my iPhone,but the 4 photos I took didn&#39;t come out.  I heard a helicopter behind me, but kept looking at the weird UFO. It hovered for a minute more and then &#34;disappeared.&#34;  Not sure  though, could have flown out of view fast.<n>

I live 5 miles south of sky harbor.  To my amazement there they were!!!  About 20 white orbs. All flying from the west to east.  About 9 orbs broke off and hovered. what looked like to my angle over sky harbor or even a bit more to the north of the airport.<n> <n><n> <n><n> so the 9 the broke off. 3 started to form a triangle with one blinking (strobing) fast in the center top of the triangle.  The other 3 try to make what seem to be a other triangle to me facing to the west ( none in this formation where blinking) later these appeared to form in to one orb..  And the other three where just hanging around watching.  Mind you it was cloudy and raining last night. But some of the orbs shined thru the clouds.  Then they flew off one by one from the hover over the sky harbor to the east toward AJ (gold canyon) area.<n>

Being just before Christmas, there was a lot of light from passing vehicles and of course from the mall itself.<n> <n><n> <n><n> All of a sudden, I became aware of a single bright light passing rapidly overhead, directly over my car maybe 2-3,000 feet up or possibly higher than that, moving in the same direction as my car.  As quickly as I saw it (I did NOT imagine a bright light moving overhead), it was gone, so it was moving quite fast. In all, the whole incident couldn&#39;t have lasted more than 3 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In my best judgment, no way that was a plane, a satellite, or even a reflection on my windshield, which was my first thought, since I plainly saw an isolated light up in the sky outside the car, and obviously very bright (like a ball of light) in order to show up over the ambient light from the mall and passing vehicles.  I had the car windows rolled up, so I wasn&#39;t able to hear anything to be honest.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Since I live nearby, I know planes don&#39;t customarily fly over the Brookwood Village, much less that low, so that is obviously not a flight path.  There is no way the light could have been from a military jet, a private jet or even a regular plane, since I would have noticed lights on its wings, or a blinking tail light etc. and again it was moving far too fast to be a plane.  This was a SINGLE bright light (the color of a car headlamp) which was moving very rapidly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have no idea what it could have been, but thought you&#39;d like to know.  I started to call 911, but decided against it, so I don&#39;t know if anyone else has reported this.<n>

12/13/12 19:00|Fort Smith|AR|Circle|2 minutes|Seeing multiple round yellowish/whiteish colored orbs/ufo's in the night sky almost every night in Fort Smith, Arkansas.|12/20/12|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/095/S95239.html|438|ndxe201212| Seeing multiple round yellowish/whiteish colored orbs/ufo&#39;s in the night sky almost every night in Fort Smith, Arkansas<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am a seasoned photographer and for the past 8 months or so, I&#39;ve been going outside into my backyard almost every night.  I&#39;ve been seeing some incredibly odd and wierd activity going on in the night sky since this past April of 2012. The main things I have been seeing are random stationary flashes of light in the night sky and white-colored lighted and sometimes orange-colored lighted round orbs/ufo&#39;s.  The flashes of light seem to occur at random points in the sky and at random times.  As for the white rounded lights and orange colored lights (orbs).. from the 6 to 7 months I&#39;ve been watching/witnessing them, I&#39;ve come to the theory that they are reacting/investigating commercial/civilian aircraft at night.  My theory is that they are attracted to the strobe/beacon lights that aircraft must use during night time flights.. because whenever there is high air-traffic over the top of my house, that&#39;s when I tend to see them the most.  The other thing that lea! ds me to believe that they&#39;re investigating and or are attracted to the lights from commercial/civilian/military aircraft is the fact that 90% of the time, when I see an airplane/helicopter approaching to fly over or close to flying over the top of my house.. 90% of the time I&#39;ll see one of these white-lighted orbs and the orb will suddenly appear (like someone turned on a light bulb from the switch) and will either intersect the paths of the airplanes or will follow the exact same flight path that the airplane/helicopter just flew.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Also, sometimes these white colored orbs will be very dim.. but sometimes will slowly start to get really bright (like someone using a dimmer switch on a light bulb to slowly turn up or down the brightness level of the bulb) and sometimes they&#39;ll stay really bright for a long time and then they&#39;ll start to slowly fade/dim back down to their original brightness level.. or sometimes they&#39;ll even dim all the way out to where you can&#39;t see them at all. Almost like someone turned off the light switch, per say.  That&#39;s the best I know how to explain it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have quite a few of these things on video.  I actually got the best video footage that I&#39;ve ever gotten over the past 7 to 8 months.. just last night!  I got video of a civilian airplane and one of these orbs passing each other.  I also have video of these things showing how they go from almost invisible to incredibly bright and then dimming back down to either barely visibly or completely turned off.<n> <n><n> <n><n> These objects appear to definitely be round in shape and when I watch some of the videos I capture of these things, I can actually see colors that airplanes don&#39;t use and the colors almost seem to morph into each other before each color changes from one color to another color.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The best thing to do, in my opinion.. would be for me to send one of my videos to you, so that you can see exactly what I am seeing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Now, of course, there are nights where I won&#39;t see any of these things.. which is generally the same nights where there is very little to no air traffic within the vicinity of my house, which is yet another reason why I think these things are attracted to the lights from airplanes/helicopters.<n>

I have seen many satellites, fast low orbit ones and slow ones, this point of light had all the earmarks of a fast low orbit satellite as I watched it and it took a sudden turn without stopping or slowing to my surprise. I made note of the stars in the area and got a copy off my star program and plotted the path in the attached drawing. nothing else happened and there were no sounds.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Clear skies.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Looking north I found Cassiopeia and shifted my view southwest to Cygnus. I saw a small private plane moving northwest from Draco.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I was tracking the plane, a large sphere appeared just to the south west of Cygnus.  It then faded in a &#34;pulsing&#34; fashion.  I thought it might have been sunlight reflecting on a satellite, yet the light was at least the same magnitude as Jupiter and five (5) times the diameter.  Light color was white.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Just  after that thought, the light pulsed on again, slightly moving to the southeast.  Both times the light pulsed on and off while moving.  Time between pulses was about 3 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> By this time the small plane was in the immediate area of the event and the light again &#34;pulsed&#34; on and off while still moving southeast.<n> <n><n> <n><n> End of event.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Duration: 20 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After the event I remember the shape of the object was slightly oval in the plane horizontal to my view.  I also got the impression that the object was higher than the small planes altitude (approx. 3,500&#39;) since the plane never reacted to the &#34;pulses.&#34;  Visually the object traveled about 2/3rds the way from the center cross star of Cygnus southeast towards the star at end of the cross.<n>

It didn&#39;t look like a migration, they looked scared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After I pulled out my phone camera and started filming, as the crows were above us, me and my friend blacked out and started puking out of nowhere for no reason.  It was the worst puke i have ever had. i stopped puking before he did, and i was able to look at him, and he was hysterical, he was claiming that something was in his head &#34;a worm&#34; like thing he could feel it.  He said his throat felt like something was shoved down it.  We were the only ones on the trail at that very moment,  We were very scared, because there was no reason for this to be happening.  It was like something took control over our bodies.  I have a feeling this was the work of an extra-dimensional alien of some sort, I just cant exp! lain why or how.  Those crows were a cover for something. I just know it.<n>

It was traveling east to west along the tree line in the distance at a high rate of speed.  I live on a large mountain and visually followed the light for approximately  3-5 seconds across the sky along the tree line in the distance until it disappeared out of sight.  I&#39;m still in awe at what I witnessed! I&#39;ve seen many &#34;falling&#34; stars and this by all means was no falling star.  This light was traveling straight without any angle.  The falling stars that I&#39;ve seen &#34;fall,&#34; as in decline or pitch down even slightly, this bright white light was moving perfectly perpendicular across the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The odd thing is that I remember talking to my Boyfriend and his Father over this past summer about an occurrence they witnessed several years ago in Sabattus.  I believe it was Fall of 2008(estimating)  They had said they were driving North up a large hill heading out of town on Route 126 in Sabattus when my Boyfriends father slammed on the brakes as they were cresting the hill as he heard my Boyfriend scream, &#34;Oh my god Dad,..Your gonna hit it..&#34;  And in that split second they both said they saw the brightest of white lights zoom in &amp; out of sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My Boyfriend saw it first moving impossibly fast towards them at a high speed downward angle and when he screamed, still focused on it, his Father only caught a split second of it moving incredibly fast upward, as fast as his head and eyes could turn and follow it for that split second.  They both agreed it was no falling star...this light had changed directions from traveling at a downward pitch to instantly changing its di! rection to an upward angle.  I remember them telling me how amazingly bright white and unbelievably fast it was.  They said it spooked them both and they remember it as if it were yesterday.<n>

Then the light began to move slowly towards the east.  It flew directly over our heads.  It was triangular shaped, silent and had three thrusts at the end of it.

Green.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As the craft flew away, the second one in line began to fire up the same way, then repeated the exact same flight pattern as the first, looking and sounding the exact same.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As the second one began to get further from our sight, the third and fourth repeated the pattern.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Today is 12/15/12 at 1:49 am.

Before backing out of my driveway, I checked my rear-view and driver-side mirrors to make sure that no other vehicles were behind me. Upon looking in my driver-side mirror, I noticed two lights very close together at roughly 35 degrees and possibly 500-1000 feet in the air; this object appeared south of my home. I looked for a moment slightly confused as it was a mostly overcast evening. The longer I started, the longer my girlfriend started at me wondering what I was looking at. When I looked over at her, she kind of tossed her hands up wondering what I was doing, I pointed back and up.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After doing this, I got out of my car. She then exited her car and wondered what I was looking at. I pointed it out to her and she was also confused. She then pointed out another set of identical lights roughly 1000 feet to the right (towards the southwest). I then spotted a third set of lights roughly another 1000 feet further to the southwest. All of these lights appeared to be at the same altitude but was unable to make out anything that resembled a shape.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As we looked at these stationary lights, the first set of lights started tilting to the right as if if was going to start moving, it however stayed stationary. When we looked over at the other two sets of lights, they had done the same thing. I am not sure as to whether or not these were coordinated events, or circumstantial. At this point, we actually questioned what we were looking at. We kind of jokingly dismissed it as ufo&#39;s and got back into our cars and headed out to the gas station that is at the corner of state road 38 and 109 in Markleville, Indiana.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I continued looking to the south as I was driving to watch the lights that we had spotted. They were still there, and the further from my home that I drove, I spotted 2-3 more. When we got to the gas station, we watched for another few minutes. By this point, the objects had started moving slowly to the west.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I got back home I looked again, and each set of lights was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Having served in the Air Force and being familiar with several different types of aircraft, my initial thought was that we had seen a small fleet of helicopters preforming late night maneuvers. The more I thought about it though, the objects (after tilting to the right) did not appear to move. It is common for us to see commercial aircraft over our homes at night as we live in an area that is a commonly traveled flight path for airliners to land at the Indianapolis International Airport. It is also common, though less so, that we have military jets fly over our home. This however, generally only happens during air shows at the airfield located around McCordsville, Indiana and rarely outside of spring or late fall. Also, these objects were 100% silent. The only noises that we heard were from our running vehicles.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I captured no photographs of this event, and it wouldn&#39;t likely have been good photographs due to low light. I would however be more than willing to sketch what we witnessed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thank you for taking the time to read this rather lengthy report.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

All of what was visible was as big as the front quarter of a fuselage of a small plane.  However,  as I watched it, I had the feeling that there was more to its size than the shimmering/fiery orange I could see in the darkness.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After we saw it, the object seemed  to speed up and rise slowly as it moved south along the beach.  It then disappeared. I must repeat, I have never seen anything like it. It looked like flame, yet I somehow knew it wasn&#39;t.  The flame didn&#39;t spread, and had it been a plane on fire, it would have spread! It also moved silently, and we were ! close enough to hear a motor had there been one. I also sensed that the object wasn&#39;t solid.<n>

I went outside to trace the sound, and then was able to locate the jet when I realized that there was another craft in the sky which the jet appeared to be intercepting/circling.  The craft looked like it could be a large airplane (chevron shaped, red flashing lights), but the wings appeared to be lit in red as well.  It was moving much slower across the sky, but by the time it was realized that it was even there...it was blocked by the treeline.<n> <n><n> <n><n> First inclination is that the large craft was an airplane, but the jet plane following it/chasing it made it suspicious.  The large craft was traveling west, potentially from Pease Airforce Base.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The sighting was confirmed by a friend that lives 0.5 mile away.  He only saw the large craft (the smaller jet was very hard to see, it looked like a satellite).<n> <n><n> <n><n> As a side note, the night was very clear and starry.<n>

When we first saw the jets and the object we were thinking this object must be a plane in trouble or something it&#39;s going to crash, but when we saw the manuvers and the rate this object moved not to mention the dodging of the military planes this object appeared to do! We are shaking our heads saying what did we just see?  What were those military Jets doing with this object...Looked and felt like a UFO chase to us???????<n>

The noise got louder and we realized it was above our home.  we both exited home and looked up.  A large round object fairly low to the tree line was hovering for   about one minute.  A very bright red light triangular in shape was emitting from it.  We then heard to booms and two jets raced at amazing speeds toward it. one jet hit the afterburner and went straight for the object then broke away from it at a hard right angle. the second jet circled it . The object then moved quickly away from our home. The jets then gained altitude and flew a straight line toward mt kearsarge.  We did nor sleep well after this event.  THIS WAS SCARY for us both! We both agree this occurance appeared that the jets were engaging on a UFO.   we thought we were under attack. news next day said air force! out of mass was doing late night manouvers practice.  It was clearly a scramble but the UFO was so loud!!!<n>

I could not tell how far distant but assumed that they were planes coming into the SF Bay Area from the Pacific Ocean area, but that they were in a position in the sky where passenger planes do not normally appear.  I could not even try to guess how far they were apart but using the finger method they appeared to be approximately 1 1/2 fingers apart in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I watched, the first one appeared if it was traveling slowly and started to turn to the right and climb higher. It eventually disappeared and I thought that maybe it was a plane that had disappeared into some distant clouds.  I watched the remaining visible light and followed the same path and then disappeared in the almost exact same place.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I know absolutely that these are not any known aircraft as every night while I wait for my wife to come home outside I continually watch the skys and watch all kinds of aircraft, both near and extremely far away fly by.  You can ALWAYS see their navigational markers flashing but these lights I saw tonight did not blink at all, no red/green/white blinking navigational lights anywhere, just the same steady orange-ish red-ish color.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Approximately 3 or 4 minutes after the first 2 disappeared, 3 more appeared coming from the same direction.  These though, when I first saw them appeared to be a brighter red-ish color and then dimmed to the same color as the others.  These were also approx 1 1/2 finger apart and followed the same path and disappeared in the same area as the first to.  Once all 3 of these disappeared 2 more appeared approximately 3 minutes later and again, followed the same path and disappeared in the same place.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I thought there was a cloud or something in that area and about a minute later I saw a distant plane (with blinking nav lights) fly from my right to the left (approx north to south) in the same area and distance and it was completely visable till it disappeared far to my left and far far south from where those lights disappeared so I know there were no clouds in that area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At this time it was 9:26 PM and about that time my wife came home from work. Just as she exited her car and was walking up the driveway, one more appeared again, I pointed it out to her and at first she thought it was a plane and I said no, just watch. 2 more appeared and she watched while the first one disappeared in the same area again and then went inside.  I waited and saw that the other 2 followed the same route and disappeared in the same place again.<n>

Upon further inspection, I noticed that what I saw was not shaped like a plane, but more like a cylinder with a smaller cylinder attached. It was extremely loud, and had a few colored lights blinking on it, I believe they were green and red. It also had a huge spotlight pointing down.  The color of the spotlight was very white and extremely bright, but did not appear to be looking for anything specific, especially at the speed it was flying.  It seemed to be flying to the north, and then when I thought it was out of sight, I heard the sound of it retuning, at which point I went indoors.  I was afraid.<n>

I went outside with my 2 dogs at approximately 8:15 to 8:20PM. I always enjoy looking at the early morning and nighttime sky.  I live about 45 miles southeast of Columbus Ohio in the middle of nowhere, so there is very little light pollution from the city lights to ruin my beautiful view of the stars. It had rained for several days prior to this day so the cloud cover up until now had been constant.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I walked down the few steps from my deck on to the sidewalk. The dogs were out in the yard somewhere in the darkness doing what dogs do.  I looked up and there was the beautiful star lit sky that I had missed for several days.  I was looking up and westward, probably around 70 degrees off of the horizon, not straight up but still at a rather steep angle.  As I was admiring what I had so terribly missed, I noticed that one of the ‘stars’ was moving. It was moving very quickly from a westerly direction towards the east.  My first thought was that it must be the ISS (International Space Station). I know it can be viewed at certain times and saw it myself a few years ago when one of the local TV weathermen mentioned on his telecast when and where to look for it.  The moving ‘star’ was just that………….about the same brightness as an average star in the nighttime sky and seemingly about the same size and distance away.  It was moving very, very quickly and then I realized it couldn’t be ! the ISS because it wasn’t moving in an exact straight path but rather had a slight waver to it as it traveled. It also didn’t maintain the same constant speed but would slow down slightly and the speed back up again. I blinked my eyes a couple of times and thought to myself, &#34;Am I really seeing what I think I’m seeing?&#34;<n> <n><n> <n><n> I thought for a moment of running into the house to get my wife and have her see what I was seeing.  But I was afraid that it may be gone by the time I was able to persuade her to see for herself.  I continued to watch this peculiar ‘star’ when it suddenly made a very quick ‘U’ turn, turning to the south and then immediately back towards the west again.  This ‘U’ turn took all of 2 seconds tops. I knew then it couldn’t be any kind of conventional aircraft.  A jetliner has to make a prolonged swooping turn that would take many, many seconds.  An asteroid or meteorite would not make any turn at all to the best of my knowledge.  It was much too high to be a helicopter. I continued to watch this object as it was heading west again at a fast pace.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Suddenly, it made a 90 degree fight turn towards the north and traveled at the speed of a bullet until it was out of sight. This entire event that I witnessed was over a period of 15 to 20 seconds at the most. I continued to watch to see if ! it returned and went back outside several more times as the evening wore on but never saw it again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was no audible sound from the object. It had no blinking lights but rather just the same constant glow and color as the stars. I went into the house and told my wife what I had just witnessed. She looked at me as if I had three heads. I told her that I should report this to ‘somebody’………….the Sheriff, the Highway Patrol………the Columbus International Airport……but who? She Googled something on her i-Phone and came up with the National UFO Reporting Center. I called the listed phone number and left a message. I received a call back a short time later and spoke with Mr. Peter Davenport, the director. He said he was very interested in my sighting and asked me to document what I saw on their web-sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am a 59 year old male.  I’m a Design Supervisor for an engineering company in Columbus Ohio.  We provide the design and engineering of protection and control systems for the local electric utility.  I’ve been doing this work for over 40 years.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I’ve never witnessed a UFO before and quite frankly never thought I would.<n>

Over the next few minutes we watched a strange formation of lights that changed shape (or formation?)... morphed several times.  At first I thought it was a huge flock of geese (much bigger than any natural flock), but as if the &amp;quot;geese&amp;quot; emitted their own white light source.  From our point of view on Mt. Washington looking directly north the formation came into line of sight right above the confluence of the rivers at the point of downtown.  Approximate distance less than half a mile.  It then meandered above downtown going to the right and then to the left and back again before continuing in an eastern direction and picking up speed dramatically.  As it picked up speed it gained altitude and the lights flickered out of sight.  As for shape it changed, but it did maintain a V of sorts.  It resembled a cluster of stars.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

This evening, Wednesday, 12/12/12, at around 5:00, I was outside gazing at the stars when I looked to the east-south-east to see a VERY prominent, almost glittering, yellowish light in the sky, several degrees above the horizon, well above the tree tops. It was not up, up, up, in the sky. “Whoa,” I thought, “Mars? Really? No!” The light shone for about 4 seconds and then extinguished, and suddenly re-appeared well to the right (further to the south) of the first siting. This time the light was more intense, and shone for another 3 or 4 seconds, only to go out again and then re-appear, about a second later, even further to the south, glittering in the sky on the same horizontal plane as seen before.  This time I felt I could discern distinct lights.  This too shone for about 3 or 4 seconds then vanished again, and yes, re-appeared now in the south, again on the same horizontal pl! ane, again shining for a few seconds before disappearing. I felt as if I could track it! If it lit up again further to the south, I could not see it, as now the trees were in the way, though I thought I discerned a bright light at one point through the tops of the balsam.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I continued to stay on the porch, and sure enough, about 7 minutes later, the light appeared again in the south-east, and did the same pattern of behavior – appearing in the south-east and then going out after about 3 seconds and then re-appearing further to the east (yes, it was now going in the opposite direction).<n> <n><n> <n><n> Note that the light -- from one source I believe, not several -- did not move up or down, or side to side, when I observed it (when it appeared). It seemed stationary. It was not a white light, but a warm light, more yellow-white, or yellow.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The area in which I live is a very, very quiet place. VERY quiet. And I spend a lot of time outdoors, even at night. I like checking out the progress of the stars. I know the sound of jets from afar, and did not hear anything coinciding with or following the appearance of this phenomenon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I wasn’t frightened, just way, way curious!!<n>

The skies were completely blue.  We were on the stretch of I-5 where there was nothing around but fields of grass and farmland.

At first I thought it was just a plane, but I&#39;ve never seen a plane with that bright of a light during the daytime when the sun&#39;s still out, especially with how far it was.  Then I thought it was just a really bright star.  I pointed it out to my girlfriend and she saw it, too, and we joked that it was a shooting star.  I kept my eye on it because I was still puzzled at the fact I could see a &#34;star&#34; during the daytime in the bright blue sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then, all of a sudden, it was it turned sideways, and I couldn&#39;t see the light anymore, but I could see the side of it. Since it was far away, it just looked like a dot.  Then, with the blink of an eye, it was gone.  The dot was gone and the light was gone.  My girlfriend and I were confused.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were staring into the distant sky trying to spot the &#34;dot&#34; or the &#34;star&#34; we thought we saw, but it just wasn&#39;t there.  It was gone, like it was never there.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My head hurts from trying to convince myself that it wasn&#39;t a UFO and trying to convince myself that it was.  I really think it was...<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.  PD))<n>

As I was traveling up 129 back twards gainesville were I live.  I saw this large object which I though was a helicopter with carrying something.  As it crossed the rd It looked like a hammer top with the teeth end forward and then at the bottom was a upside down peace that looked like a hammer top with the teeth end in the same direction but pointing up.  They were seperated by a single tube looking object.  They were silver in color but the peace conecting them was black.  I was about a quarter mile away from the object that was large in size.  When I got a good look at it it looked like something from a movie.  I have been in the military for 6years and never saw anything like it.  I came across this site while googleing the event to see if anyone else saw it.  I saw anouther simular siting on the site from last year in jefferson.  It had no sound and was ! in laming terms very interesting.  It was deff not anything that anyone has ever seen flying in the sky befor.  It was a cloudy day and it was very low in sky maby a few thousand feet above the ground.  It diaapered behind a high bank that was beside the rd and disapered behind Jefferson High school.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Seen them way far up, looking sort of like jet smoke streaks but it wasn&#39;t, I seen two small yellow circle looking.g things kind of following the streaks in the sky.  Mainwasn&#39;t just seeing bugs I rolled my window down driving down the interstate amdseen them clearly   They were going so fast it almost looked slow motion.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was on the phone with m wife describing what I&#39;m seeing asking her to go outside at home and see if she can see them from our house when a dark Dolores, grayish kind of green looking circle-ovalish looking thing went over the top of my far which is a Nissan XTerra.  It wasn&#39;t right above me enough to reach but much closer than the other 16 ish objects.<n> <n><n> <n><n> From where it started in Kankakee is a thirty minute drive from my house.  I called my wife three different times in that thirty minutes but she didn&#39;t see anything because the trees surrounding our house. (Yes there are trees where I live on Bayles Lake)<n> <n><n> <n><n> As soon as I g to around Buckley it started getting dark but they disappeared.  The yellow lights/circles disappeared first then the dark circle figure then all the streak looking things disappeared slowly leaving one behind just to disappear shortly after the rest.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;ve never seen anything like it in my entire life and it! completely freaked me out.

Within 5 minutes there was about 30 aircrafts.  One of the aircrafts of a group of two aircrafts flying northbound split off formation and joined another two aircrafts traveling westbound.  The aircraft that broke formation turned at an unheard of 90 degree angle instantly.  This is way more activity than I ever noticed at night or in the day ever. Also these aircraft were traveling extremely faster than I have ever seen an aircraft fly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

One of the UFO&#39;s Were Oval Shaped and Bright White,  The UFO Was Very Big at first Before Hovering Away . It had to be 5 times the size of a airplane.  The Other Ufo was Cigar Shaped and  Half the size of the Oval Shaped UFO and was also Bright White.  Both  Had No Noise and  No exhaust .

Triangular craft, noiseless, hovering large.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This event occurred the day following the fireball in th urals in Russia.  I was awakened by a bright light at about 3:30 am.  I got up instantly and saw an orange yellow bright fireball which was bright enough to awake me and instantly go to my window.  It moved in an north to south direction, tangentially at a low angle of descent to the east of the town. It was bright enough to light up the town, but lasted in total only five seconds in total.  I do not recall any sort of tail.  It disappeared suddenly without any noise or explosion. It appeared to my eye to be a meteor, moving at an extreme rate of speed.  It was certainly not a balloon or Chinese lantern.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Parenthetically I saw a large triangular craft in the nearby Iao valley about two years ago, at about 3:00. It was noiselessly motionless above the highest local peaks of the west maui mountains. It had lights along its edges at the long axis.  I watched for 15 minutes or so, then left. I have seen several identical objects in palm desert in the past, over the period of three to five years ago.  I watched these for hours. Silent.  Motionless at night always. Usually as I recall around the same time of night. I have inexplicably become used to waking up at 0:300 and feeling compelled to arise and direct my gaze toward Orion.  This behavior began about six years ago.  I have no explanation. I add only that I had the feeling, based on just a gut reaction, that these triangular craft are not alien.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thank you.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date is approximate.

They caught my attention due to the fact they seemed engaged in some flight patterns that didn&#39;t make sense, they were heading directly toward one another but never collided.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then I noticed the other crafts that were identical at other points in the sky, all very close together and not displaying any typical aircraft lighting.  They seemed to be hovering more than anything but I could see something like fire coming from the end of them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I drove on all but 3 of them vanished and the 3 that were left formed almost a triangle formation of sorts in the sky, eventually 2 vanished and left 1 which appeared to be closer now and the &#34;fire&#34; I saw coming from the end of it now looked pink in color.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have never seen anything like this in our skies before.  Also I would like to note that about 30 minutes later as I was sitting at an intersection the sky in front of me was daylight as it should be and when I looked to my right the sky there was in pitch darkness, I was very confused as to how it can be daylight yet dark so close together, I snapped photos of the daylight/darkness part with my cellular phone to show other people to see if anyone could explain it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> All of this is very strange and I dont know what to make of it, I came here after finding it on google hoping perhaps someone else had seen these things and reported them also.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides little contact information.

At first I thought it was a cell phone tower, but realized it was too high up in the sky, it was moving, and changing form(but always went into a triangle), and the flashing was not constant(it kind of reminded me of Morse Code or something, like the lights were talking to each other.)  All the lights flashed red, except for once in a while one of the lights would flash blue, but not very often.  It was headed North, and I told someone I knew(an hour away from where I live) to see if they could see it.  About 30 to 40 minutes later he could see it for himself.  He told me it was headed back my way, so I go back out right away so maybe I could see it again (get a video this time) and I saw one South of were I live and my friend could still kind of see the one by him, but it was headed more South West of me.   The one I saw the second time was straight south of me and I watched it head East until it completely disappeared.  I am not 100% sure that I seen two of them or it was just the same one.  I just want to make that clear, but I definitely saw at least one.<n>

In the center of the craft was a very bright white light and on both tips of the object there were more bright white lights. It was about the size of a football field.  And was only about 1,000 feet up in the air.  It continued across the sky, leaving town, but it disappeared instantly and the noise was gone, only leaving dead silence.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This also occurred during a meteor shower, if that has any significance.

My wife was the driver and was first to notice the UFO straight in front of us about 1/4 mile in the sky.  She said there is a UFO. I  looked at it and thought at first it might be a helicopter as it was kinda hovering. It was already dark out and had patchy fog.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After I looked closer I saw it continue to fly westward but not in a straight line.  It seemed to be smaller than a helicopter but couldn&#39;t make out any size or shape.  It was just a single light kinda moving westward maybe 10 MPH.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I rolled down my window and stuck my head and chest out of the passenger window to watch it as it was behind us a little now about the 7-8 o&#39;clock angle.  My wife continued to watch it too.  I was telling her pull over, pull over.  We next saw it change to a bluish color and move really fast in ! a small area switching directions quickly and almost randomly.  It then changed back to the yellowish color and gained a little height as it continued to travel west by north/west.  Almost as if trying to stay in the low fog/clouds that were in the area.  We never heard any sound from it and the lights were weird in color.  I guess you could say they were kinda rich/dark in color.  Not like any lights i&#39;ve seen before.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.  PD))<n>

It sounded like thunder as it flew by.  Completely illuminated must have been  the size of a football fiel;d or bigger.

12/11/12 04:30|Spokane Valley|WA|Egg|10 minutes|Objects light up the sky like daylight before disappearing.|12/20/12|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/095/S95167.html|498|ndxe201212| Objects light up the sky like daylight before disappearing<n> <n><n> <n><n> 04:30 HLT Spokane Valley, WA 12/11/2012 I was headed to work this morning at 0430 Hours, and in the Southern sky I noticed two (2) objects flying in a parallel line moving from West to East just above the river across from Felts Field.  The objects were sound less and if you were to take a just a glace to see what it was, would appear to be helicopters.  However, as I drove East on Upriver Drive just by Pasadena Elementary School, the objects were flying at about 120 feet in elevation from the ground, the one that was further away (so on the side closest to the river) disappeared as I came upon the elementary school.  The second object was flying slowly directly over me, I was able to see the object as it passed directly over my vehicles about 15 feet above the tree line. I stopped my vehicle on the side of the road and there was nothing but silence in the air, the object seem to glide slowly across the sky.  From this vantage point, I was able to see the shape of the craft in the air.  It resembled an egg with lights.!  There was a light coming from the bottom of the craft as well as a band of lights that went around the middle.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I passed Argonne Ave. and noticed that the object that had flown directly over me was now following me as I continued my drive towards Sullivan Ave.  As I approached Arbor Crest Winery, the object was hovering over the hill to the East of Hutton Settlement.  That is when I really saw a good outline of the object. It was egg shaped but flying with the fat end front and the smaller rounded tip was to the rear. It was approximately 30 feet long and at least half that tall. It was dark in color with a single white light illuminating the earth from beneath.  I sat in my car for at least 3 minutes watching this object just hover there, when it turned towards me and my vehicle and the white lights that made up the &amp;quot;belt&amp;quot; of the object became extremely bright as did the single light on the bottom of the object. At 0438 HLT there is no natural light in the sky at that time in this time of year, however, the object&#39;s light illuminated the sky and surrounding area so well you wo! uld&#39;ve thought it was the middle of the day. It was the brightest white light that I have ever had the opportunity to witness. As it reached the peak of brightness (after 5 seconds or so) it just disappeared completely, like it was flying in hyper-speed from the space movies.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I, being absolutely baffled, started my car back up and continued East towards Sullivan Ave. As I came up on Plante&#39;s Ferry Park (located literally just around the corner from the Arbor Crest Winery), I noticed the other object had returned and was off in the distance about 400 feet away in the Southern sky at an altitude of approx 150 feet. As my car approached the softball diamonds on my Right hand side, that object illuminated bright and disappeared just as the other object. It was so bright I could see the four (4) diamonds, the play area for kids, and the puddles on the dirt in the infield. This morning was overcast and dark, I couldn&#39;t see anything until the light shone on the field. This was at approximately 0440 HLT. Since Saturday December 8th, 2012 I have been lucky enough to witness 2 separate events. What&#39;s going on?<n>

The intensities of the lights were fading on and off.  Also, I looked up at the clouds while the ufo was still int he sky and they were moving unbelievably fast and I saw what looked like a huge almost transparent cloud move fast.<n>

It was too bright and too big to be a plane.  It lit the sky and it went out.  I would say it was over North Miami.<n>

It was around 10 pm.  My brother gestured to me to look into the sky and he was suprised at what he was seeing.  I thought he was messing with me and expected him to joke with me when I looked.   When I finally did look, I noticed 6 lights in the sky.   They were lined up and 3 of them had just dimmed out.  I say &amp;quot;dimmed&amp;quot; because it didn&#39;t seem like an immediate cessation of the light.  They did dissipate quickly, but it seemed kind of slow.  I did get a good look at the last remaining 3 lights and grabbed for my phone.  They were between orange and yellow in color, more orange probably.  They were round in shape and did not appear to be moving.  There was absolutely no sound and that was strange because from where they were, if it were any kind of aircraft, I would have heard something.  I did record the second set of lights on my iphone.  It shows 3, in a bit of a diamond shape.  I record 2 at first.  One disappears almost immediately and the second a few seconds later.  Then a 3rd appears to the bottom right of the others.  It then disappears.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was very strange and I cannot explain what it was we witnessed.  It was also strange because we live in a rural area with no bonafied airports within 70-80 miles in any direction. My brother and I are officers in our organization.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides little contact information.  PD))<n>

One was white in a triangle shape, and another was blue and changed shapes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They appeared and disappeared on and off for about 15 minutes.  There was no sound, after the 15 minutes there was an airplane or jet of some sort that came from the northern end of the sky and the other objects had all gone away, I got pictures but once I tried to get video my camera had died.<n>

The orange like light appeared for about 3 seconds each in succession starting 1 then the 2nd, then the 3rd.  After third appeared all disappeared. Within 10 seconds multiple high maneuverable aircraft were circling the area.  The aircraft which appeared to be fighter aircraft due to their turn axis, remained in the area for 30 seconds and appeared to head south.  After they headed south, the lights appeared again in the southerner direction in which the aircraft were heading to.  After this they were lost from my view due to their elevation and tree&#39;s line or sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> No noise was heard, no engine sounds due to distance.  The lights and the aircraft appeared to be different in nature due to the light emitting aircraft having no faa lights, while the other aircraft had faa lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Over the past three days there has been an increase in sonic booms.  I personally have heard three over the past week.<n>

A fourth was also noted, but not part of the triangle. T hese were extremely low to ground.  In relation to full moon the fireballs witnessed would be approximately less than 1/4 of moon in size.  I witnessed them for approximately 20 seconds. They did not make any sound. These fireballs blinked off twice. The second time they blinked off they did not return.  These fireballs did not move while we witnessed them. Just hovered.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were in the car during the sighting, facing south. The lights were observed over pasture to our left.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This sighting was in a very rural area of Oklahoma.  I was unable to get images.<n>

I was with my daughter and her son who is one year and four months old.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We parked about 100 feet from the store. It was quite cold and we headed for the store entrance.  I happened to look in the sky in the northeast direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first I saw one light, and thought it could be an airplane.  But then two more lights appeared and the three lights seemed to be traveling together ala three synchronized swimmers.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The three lights moved up and down and for a few moments appearing to be on the same roller coaster in the sky.  The lights slowly changed colors, mostly reds, oranges and yellows.  At times one or two of the lights would suddenly disappear and seconds later re-appear.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The three lights resembled meteors (as in “shooting stars”) – but much bigger, and moving in unusual ways.  Shooting stars streak across the sky and suddenly &#34;blip&#34; and they disappear.  These three fireballs in the sky were clearly visible and lasted for at least 3 to 4 minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My daughter saw the lights too.  The lights did not appear to her to be what she would consider as a &#34;UFO,&#34; but I asked her what she thought we saw, and she could not explain what we had just witnessed.  My grandson stared at the fireballs but had no comment.<n>

I am a teacher from this area and the other family members are also from this area and blue collar workers.  We were standing on the second floor balcony of our home, overlooking the intercostal waterway and the ocean beyond, looking at the night sky after dinner. The sparkle lights moved about, heading away towards the North East then came back towards the West closer towards us.  These lights were high up in the atmosphere and did not appear to be any type of aircraft any of us had ever seen.  This light show continued randomly within this area several minutes and then several (3) of them seemed to bust or expand into a bright amber colored star or diamond shape and white star light shapes.  A few minutes later, this process began again but! with fewer lights and a few more were to explode into golden star light also.  After this they didn&#39;t appear anymore.  I would like to know if any other reports of this nature were reported in this area.<n>

My wife and I live about 1.5 miles north of Fairchild Air Force Base in Washington state.  On Saturday night Dec 8th 2012  at approx. 11.45 PM L  I was out on my sun deck and to the north west, above the tree line,  I saw an orange orb.  It was way up in the sky and I kept on watching it  thinking it was just a  star.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Suddenly it started to change colors from orange to red to bright white.  As it was changing colors, it continuously got larger and larger.  Then it turned to bright white, it suddenly streaked down toward the ground and just before hitting the tops of the tree line it stopped and changed back to orange in color.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The orb just stayed there in position for several minutes.  Suddenly it started to change colors again from orange, to red to white all the while getting larger and larger.  When it changed to bright white, it went straight up in to the air and stopped at a very high elevation above the tree line and went back to orange in color.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After a few minutes of just sitting there, it  started to change colors again from orange to red to white. When it changed to white, too suddenly streaked down towards the earth at about a 45 degree angle. It appeared to have bounced off the earth surface and right back up in the air at an apposing 45 degrees and then faded away into the darkness. no sound ever was herd, either.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This went on for about one half an hour.  I have four other witnesses that saw this happen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.  PD))<n>

He called me outside and I saw two large red lights, one following the other, for about 3 minutes until one vanished.   The other lingered a minute longer until it too faded out. We saw the second light flicker very lightly just a few times until they were no longer visible.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They did not completely cross the sky.  We could have watched them go even further but they disappeared before then.  We heard neighbors outside and one said, ‘What the hell is that?’  so we knew we were not the only ones who saw this.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The lights did not blink and were extremely red/orange in color and quite large.  The lights were constant the entire time.  I have never seen anything like this and am continually checking the local news to see if others caught it.  The sky is extremely clear with only a few sparse clouds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Being a skeptic I couldn’t help but think it was a plane of some sort until we saw commercial planes fly by and it was extremely obvious these were not commercial planes.<n>

I was heading home from the 7-11 in Millwood.  I live on the north side of the river, turned onto Upriver Drive heading west, just about the time I got to the corner by Pasadena Elementary School I notice a couple of red lights about my side window in the middle of the corner.  I continued driving west on Upriver slowing to about 10-15 miles per hour because I had never seen lights in the sky like these before.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Now there were 8 lights that appeared just to left of Upriver, kind of looking like they were coming at me from the Airway Heights area towards Felts Field Airport.  The lights didn’t fly in a straight line, they seem to appear like slowly bobbing up and down, not a lot but out the windshield about a few inches,  They made a lot of ground very quickly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About the time I reached Dick Rd, I pulled over to the side of the rode and rolled down my window shut off the radio and fan, to see if I could hear anything but did not.  So I sat there and watched them for several minutes, as the first one got to where it looked as if it were out my window it took off toward the south not only heading south but going up very fast then stopped and hovered.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then the next one did the same,then the next one until it appeared to make like a backward J in the sky.  At that point the first one took off upwards and disappeared then the next until all were gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I then pulled back onto Upriver Drive and I as I got back out on the road again, a ball of red light slowly started descending to what appeared to be over Beacon Hill heading towards Felts Field again I have never seen any kind of light like this before in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I drove home as fast as I could probably taking 1 minute from the time I pulled back onto Upriver, I ran into the house telling my 3 sons and wife and my son’s friend and one son’s girlfriend to come out and check this out.  Told them you have never seen anything like this before in your life.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Everyone ran out the back door and at that time 3 red lights appeared in a triangle shape hovering looking southeast out my backyard for about 3 minutes before the light at the right side of the triangle took off followed by the next two.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I work in the medical field and have never before looked at this sight or have I ever called and reported anything before.  There is no way anything man made could have moved or propelled itself the way these objects could.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Our understanding is that the sighting occurred on Saturday night, December 08, 2012, at approximately 20:45 hrs.

I witnessed the event from the back porch of my residence located in north east Odessa, Texas.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The large circular mass was moving diagonally in an easterly direction  followed by a long tail.  The object, which was orange or amber in color was moving swiftly upward and then as it began to descend an explosion occurred that lighted up the sky for one or two seconds.  Then the object descended quickly to the east.  The entire incident lasted about 10 to 15 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I would estimate the object as being fairly large, perhaps about one tenth to one fifteenth the size of a full moon.<n>

Came in several groups, no recognizable formation, but most groups were 5-10 lights and seemed fixed in relative position.  Some groups appeared more fluid.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Utterly silent.  Red, white, blue, green and orange colors were observed, so changing from one to the other.  Colors were odd in appearance.  Just a big convoy in the night sky.<n>

Approximately 19:30<n> <n><n> <n><n> Driving southbound on Hwy 501 from Conway, SC to Myrtle Beach, SC while crossing the Lake Busbee bridge, my partner and I saw several red lights grouped together in the north east part of the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The lights proceeded to separate and form triangles (obtuse and acute) moving south.  There were three lights per triangle.  The movements were very rapid and linear.  The movement was so fast that the shapes just appeared.  There were several triangles formed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My partner and I pulled over to observe the phenomenon.  The lights started to disappear.  South of us, two orange lights remained.  Then one disappeared and only one was left.  It dropped down below the trees, and then it slowly rose in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> From the distance similar to that of a star, it transformed to a blurry white/silver spot.  The blur started to drop closer until it was close enough to recognize as a triangle with rounded edges.  It was spinning very fast, which created some type of &#34;waves&#34; in the air around it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When it got to the height slightly lower than a hovering helicopter, it transformed into a bubble/balloon with some type of ventilator on the side.  It was falling in a floating fashion similar to that of a plastic bag.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It floated over our heads and towards the woods before reaching Hwy 501 Business.<n>

My son and I we’re taking a drive in my girlfriends new car.  We had the sunroof open and the windows down.  We we’re headed toward Hawaii Kai from Waimanalo.  We had just passed the entrance to Sandy Beach and almost to the first turn when 3 lights came over Koko Head.  I was already driving slower than usual approximately 25mph. We both saw it at the same time and my 10 year old son said, Dad What is that?  I said I have no clue. At first you could only see 3 lights.  The one on top was orange/red and flicking rapidly.  The 2 on the bottom we’re light color with a hint of blue and constant.  The whole thing was moving really slow and looked to be just above the hill but under the cloud cover.  It went directly over our car and we could see it through the sunroof.  As it passed over it was completely silent.  At that time My son said, Dad it looks coned shaped.  I tried to keep watching it and drive at the same time through the review mirror.  I told my son to keep watching it, so he turned around and was watching it through the back window when he said WOW!  It just disappeared.  This is my first time seeing any kind of UFO.  I spoke to one of my close friends who frequent the area at night for his job and he said 3 of them saw the same thing 1 month ago from the time we saw it<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.

We were on our way to the symphony in Pocatello and as we drove by the Blackfoot airport on Teeples about 5:45 PM give or take a few seconds straight away and somewhat to our left (southeast) we saw partially hidden in relatively low clouds a series of golden yellow lights in pairs.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They would have had to be fairly large, just sitting in the sky motionless.  They were grouped in such a way that at first I thought someone had erected a huge crane with scattered lights on the metal framework but then I realized just how far up they were and I was struck by the lack of motion.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They lasted about 90 seconds and just faded away never changing their formation.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Kind of creepy.  I&#39;ve heard of theories that these are reflections from earth but these didn&#39;t look like any reflection I know of because the clouds were passing by them partially hiding them so somehow the reflection would have had to pass to the other side of the clouds and not be obscured by the cloud formation.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Additionally these were very bright lights well circumscribed unlike any reflected light I&#39;ve seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Have you ever seen anything like this?<n>

I google what I found and found a ton of people have seen the same image.<n>

I saw it for the briefest of instances.  My initial impression was that it was a military aircraft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I mentioned seeing it to a co-worker and he stated he saw something similar approximately 20-25 minutes earlier.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I found the incident to be odd because of the timing of the event.  It was early on a Saturday morning. There is a local Air National Guard base nearby but it had no aircraft up and flying that morning.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It&#39;s possible that what I saw was an aircraft but, as I said earlier, why were they flying over an urban population center at that particular time on a weekend?<n>

It had snowed out a little during the night and I decided to shovel and sweep. The sky was so clear and I could hear the lake making ice. I looked up at the sky hoping to see a satalite and i did. but while I was looking up I thouhgt i kept seeing blinking lights here and there.  I thought it was just my eyes. I finally spotted a flashing light that I could follow and I began to see many.  The traveling/ blinking lights were about the size of a smaller star and I&#39;m not sure how high up they were--maybe out of our atmosphere.The blinks looked like a camera flash.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They traveled in  irradic patterns and flashed every now and then.  I had to go inside. came back out about 15 minutes later and tried to spot them again but no luck.  It was starting to get a little lighter outside but could still see the brighter stars.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was standing facing west but I saw them almost straight above me and a little to the south, west and north. Not sure what I saw but when the sky clears again I will be looking.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Wondering if anyone else in the area had seen these.<n>

Considering I was within 500ft of whatever it was.  The object, cylinder shaped,10-15ft in length and 4-5ft wide was hovering about 100ft from the ground. Hazy gray in color yet it was transparent, it would move slow as a floating feather to lightning fast speed, when turning/change direction, it seems to pivot, at one point while recording it shot straight up at a very high speed.  This area background is industrial, residential and government.<n>

PD))|12/20/12|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/095/S95152.html|547|ndxe201212| Triangle multicolored lights and bright white orbs in sky for several months now. Recently had even closer encounter<n> <n><n> <n><n> Ive been seeing strange triangular shaped, multicolored flashing lights in the sky, mainly to the east but all around my house for a couple of months now.  I live in rural Texas, a town called Blum, that is just south of the DFW metroplex.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am a recent college graduate with a degree in psychology. I live with my parents just outside of town. On the evening of Oct. 21st, 2012, the guy I was dating (who happened to be an ex-Marine) and I were sitting out on the front porch watching the sun set. It was about 6:30-6:45pm and we saw something odd in the western sky, a dark object just over the horizon. I asked him if he could see it too, and he looked. As soon as he did, he stood up and was silent, almost catatonic for a few seconds, then asked me in a very expressive way if I had seen what he just saw.  According to him, it was as though he was peering into the cosmos.  I didnt have the same experience he did. I could just see the object floating off in the distance.  It was too far away to make out a distinct shape and was hovering in the valley between our house and the other side of the valley that makes up the Nolan River basin. Hwy 174 runs along this from Cleburne to Meridian.  Anyway, we observed this for hours, even after the sun went down and my dad and stepmom joined us when they got home from work.  We observed it through binoculars and discovered that it was triangular in shape and that there were multicolored blinking lights on every corner of it. It appeared to move around ever so slightly. You could even clearly see the iridescent twinkle to it with just the naked eye. Eventually while we were looking at it, we began to see white bright objects that were itty bitty shooting off it and streaking across the sky. Probably tens, maybe even hundreds of them. My stepmom was the first to see this since we were passing the binoculars around. They shot off in all directions and disappeared. Although, when observing through the bi! noculars, it seemed like we could see some returning to the pl! ace of o rigin (the twinkling triangular craft). The white objects were disc shaped and very fast/agile.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It may also be important to note this at this time: several times during the month of September 2012, I noticed a disc shaped object floating like it was parked just above the trees just on the other side of the valley. It was bright and had yellow/white lights pulsating in sequence around it. At the bottom of the hill on our side, which is also where the cemetery and  school house sit (our house is on top of the grade, overlooks the whole valley) there were, on several occasions, blue light figures. I dont know how best to describe them, it was like a blue flame head and the body wasnt quite discernible over such a distance (about a half mile away). But it seemed like they were beckoning to me. This happened for about a week in September. I would still see the strange blue lights from time to time throughout the month.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On the evening of Dec. 2nd, 2012, my dad, stepmom and I were sitting out on the back porch which faces the east. I saw the same kind of twinkling lights like what we had been seeing before in October and asked them if I was the only one seeing this. So they turned the lights out in the house and we all walked out back to the edge of the house and lo and behold there were a bunch of them in a formation like this:  .<n> <n><n> <n><n> .                  .                .<n> <n><n> <n><n> .<n> <n><n> <n><n> All of them were twinkling, although it was a little more difficult to see the distinctive colors of the lights emitted on the ones that are in a formation of a vertical line. The ones on the ends are much more visible and have been ever since that night and today is 12/11/12.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Also, on the night of Dec. 7th, I witnessed the most wonderful of all of these encounters. I was sitting out on the back porch, just observing this formation that I just described and the others that I have began to see also in the area around my house. I was looking in the direction of SE and I spotted a low flying one of these triangular shaped, multicolored blinking crafts probably about a football field length or maybe two off the ground rather close to my house. The colors on this were very distinctive and I noticed something else odd about it. It seemed to be flying at a 45 degree angle and there was a large, bright white light coming from one side of it that was kind of obscured by the rest of the craft. So I continued to watch this slowly drift across the sky until it started coming towards me. The closer it approached the further up in the sky it went. Then it stopped in mid-air. It started performing beautiful acrobatics and the feeling I had inside me was of pures! t joy! I felt like a little kid. During this time, I was texting my boyfriend (he and I have been dating on and off for the last year now) and he was at a party. Of course I was describing to him before just the craziness that had been going on for the last few days as far as seeing these things in the sky every night. Then, when this light started dancing across the sky I watched it for a few minutes before texting him about the incredible thing I was experiencing right at that moment. I remember consciously asking (in my mind) it to please not got away while I texted him. Anyway, he texted me back that he was shocked and since he was at a party I didnt think he would answer my call if I called right then, but I had the impulse to. So I did. While the cell was ringing, the craft started slowly drifting to the right, which was also south and the direction that he lives. It stopped moving when he picked up. And so I began describing what I was seeing, the motions it was maki! ng and all. Then it appeared to sign my name in the sky and I ! was like &amp;quot;no way!!&amp;quot; and told my boyfriend what it just did. Then he asked if I thought it could do his, and without knowing what his name was (it is saved as his nickname in my phone even), it signed his name. And then we were speculating on it and what its appearance could mean, especially around when it was happening date wise and so on, and we asked it if this would be a good time to ask questions. It drifted to the right on answers that were yes, or qualifying and then back to the center. It drifted to the left on answers that were no, or disqualifying and then back to the center. It also made a swirly-cue downward motion almost like the threads on a screw to answers that were too complex/werent ready to be given yet, and then back upwards to center. When it seemed like we were really on track with something we were talking about it would, along with drifting to the right, speed up, go up and down, almost like it was nodding (and at one point i was nodding my head alon! g with conversation while it was drifting right and it started bobbing up and down in time with my own nodding). It would nod up and down vehemently to messages of love and peace and of course eventually when the thought was done it would go back to center. This lasted for an entire hour. And then we were ready to get off the phone. I wanted to try and attempt to open up communication with it myself but by the time we got off the phone it began to disappear. Then all that was left of it was a dim red light and it was completely gone and then this dense fog fell about the place. From start to finish, this lasted from 10:05 to 11:06pm from the reference of my texts between my boyfriend and I.<n>

12/7/12 21:25|Kingston|NY|Light|5 minutes|Two Lights seen over Hudson River in Kingston, NY on 32 South.|12/12/13|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/105/S105152.html|550|ndxe201212| Two Lights seen over Hudson River in Kingston, NY on 32 South<n> <n><n> <n><n> Was coming home from work in Rhinebeck. Crossed Kingston/Rhineclif Bridge and turned south onto 32/Flatbush Rd.  Noticed two lights slightly to my left through front windshield but dismissed them as stars or possibly small planes.  Was listening to music and thinking. As I passed a the Rondout Services center on the left I glanced up and noticed the lights were still there but brighter.  They were also a reddish color.  I also noticed that they were below the cloud cover because it was thin and fuzzy stars could be seen through them.   These lights were very bright and not hazy in the same way.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I still thought they were planes or helicopters, but noticed that they didn&#39;t seem to be moving.  But since I was in motion I couldn&#39;t tell.   I continued to watch them and it became very clear quickly that they were stationary in the sky because, as I continued they seemed to be getting closer and the angle between them and my view was changing.  I was approaching a perpendicular angle to them and I noticed they were quite a bit lower and closer than I originally had thought.  By the time I got to the stoplight at the waste management station they were right in the frame of the driver&#39;s side window.  It&#39;s a lengthy light, so I took the time to roll down the window and stick my head out to really get a good look.  At that point they were right in front of my line of view out the window.  One appeared to be about 40 degrees up from the horizon (there&#39;s a rise to the left, then the Hudson River, which is about a mile away from that point) and the other was higher, to the left, at ! about 60 degrees.  I glanced at the car next to me (I was in the left hand lane), and at least the driver of that vehicle had also noticed the lights and was clearly looking at them.  Our eyes met briefly in recognition of what we were seeing.  He was also speaking to someone, but whether it was to a passenger--couldn&#39;t see into his vehicle--or into a speaker phone I couldn&#39;t tell.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I stopped and actually really looked at the lights, they were clearly stationary, very bright, steady reddish lights, very shiny.  All of a sudden, on cue, as it were, and right before the stop light turned (it almost seemed timed), the two lights very rapidly and in perfect tandem and coordination, veered at right angles to the left.  They went from stationary to rapid motion literally at once. I remember thinking...&#34;ok, this is just too weird, it&#39;s just how it&#39;s supposed to be, why couldn&#39;t it have been something else.&#34;  I drove on through the light and a little ways down the road was able to look back briefly to see if I could tell where they were heading, and I couldn&#39;t see them again. I don&#39;t know if they speeded up and disappeared or what, but they were gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I got home my partner and I plotted the sighting on a topographical map of Ulster county that we have on the wall.  Based on that, and depending on their elevation, we figured out that the lights either had to be over the Hudson itself, or close to being over S. Rhinebeck.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I don&#39;t know if anyone else saw anything, but I know at least one other driver did.<n>

The flashing looked to me like the type you see right before a lightning strike.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thinking that it&#39;s odd since the skies looked clear, I immediately looked up &amp; to my surprise, saw 3 large flashing spheres.<n> <n><n> <n><n> For that split second I looked up &amp; saw the flashing spheres, they stopped flashing at that point. However, after they stopped flashing,  I was able to make out a LARGE (COLOSSAL) dark rectangular object sailing by from which the spheres were flashing under it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> For the MONSTROUS size it was, I heard no sound. Best way to describe what I saw in simple terms: A silent sailing TITANIC ship with 3 large round white spheres flashing from underneath.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was stunned and amazed at the same time.  I&#39;ve seen in the past, on other nights, a strange red/orange shiny light strongly brighten &amp; then drop some type of flares/orbs on 2 or 3 different occasions.  But this night, I saw something much more intense &amp; phenomenal!!<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides little contact information.  PD))<n>

I thought someone was in are back yard, so I was ready to fight, but soon as all of us got outside, my dad said look up and I saw a red fire ball just bolt off into the night.  Then looked over and saw three more balls of light in a triangle shape just hover and flashing in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 5 others and myself saw this hovering triangle shape, so I ran inside to get my older brother because I  know he into this kind of that stuff because he had seen some weird things above or house before.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I came outside again the three balls off light where gone this whole thing last about 2 to 5 mins, and I know my dad is really a honest person and not really into ufo or ghost or things of that nature, but for him to come home in that kind of excitement and tell all of us to come check this out and for all of us to see it was really a different experience.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I really can’t come up wi! th a logical reason that would cause what I seen or what man made craft that could do what I saw or what my dad saw it was freaky and it got me looking up at the sky thinking differently about whats really up there.<n>

I had seen a strange light flashing in the field just behind this parking lot.  He did and we watched as 3 golden balls of light with sparkling tails &#34;danced&#34; slowly around each other, no more than 300-500 yards from where we watched, and not very high in the sky, maybe 300 yards. Their trajectory was descending, but not linear.  Sometimes they would pause for awhile or move horizontal to the ground.  At least one of them sped up about 100 yards off the ground and extinguished just before hitting the field. All of them eventually extinguished about 20-50 yards above the field.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I don&#39;t believe in this type of thing.  I am a PhD candidate in the social sciences and believe firmly in ruling out the most plausible explanations before jumping to something unlikely.  But this is empirical evidence for something that I do not have an explanation for.  I can&#39;t get the scene out of my mind and it has kept me up all night.  We do not live far from the field and in the morning we will go investigate.  I feel an irrational coward for not investigating last night, but somehow it felt overwhelmingly wrong to do so.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Oh, and after spending all night looking at the Internet, I can tell you it is not Chinese lanterns.  I&#39;ve seen a video of those and this looked nothing like that.  There was no wind to account for the movements, they were sparkling, and they were speeding up, slowing down, and hovering.<n>

Watched for about a minute, then they vanished behind the tree line. Weirdest thing I&#39;ve ever seen.<n>

I first saw the ufos at the intersection of 119 and highway 52 (next to IBM). Directly ahead (East) I saw what I though was three planes making an approach to land at DIA. This is a common site in the east at night.  I though that they looked a little strange and large. As soon as as I thought this the longer one started to &amp;quot;fall&amp;quot; leaving a small trail.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Right away i thought maybe a shooting star, but why had they have been almost stationary then start to fall? I called my wife right away. Very soon (a couple of seconds later) the other two started moving right (South) and then they all kind of danced around each other slowly moving down, although the did make movements up. I was on the phone with my wife the whole time and it was a 3 minute phone call, so I figure about 2.5 minute duration.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They all did gradually move downward disappearing behind the ! treeline.  At one point they all dissappeared for a few seconds only to reapear.  I estimate they were between 1-2.5miles away.  Between the size of a star and and asprin at roughly 30 degrees from the horizon.  They all left small glittering trails but not flame like. When the last one moved behind the tree I did not see them again.<n>

As I observed the object I noticed it was moving far too slowly to be an aircraft.  I don&#39;t think it was a helicopter because there was absolutely no noise coming from it.  It was (or appeared to be) circular in shape, it had two lights one blue and the other amber.  It also had a second set of lights that rotated around the craft, those lights were white, there were several of them and when turned on the previous one would turn off.  I could be mistaken but the combination of the second set of lights and the fact that this object was silent make me doubt it was a helicopter or airplane.<n>
12/7/12 18:40|Eldridge|IA|Light|2-4 minutes|Five orange lights, like stars in the cloudy sky, hovered motionless over a small city in Iowa.|12/20/12|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/095/S95054.html|561|ndxe201212| Five orange lights, like stars in the cloudy sky, hovered motionless over a small city in Iowa.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On the evening of December 7th, 2012, I was traveling south on New Highway 61; the city in question was located to my right. I was not driving, so I was at liberty to observe the sky without distraction. The sky was cloudy, and above the lights of the city, the clouds appeared grey and luminescent.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Above the city, I saw five lights, each a warm golden-orange color.  They looked like stars to me, both in height and magnitude; if the sky had been clear, I would have believed that they actually were stars, and I probably would’ve taken no notice.  The lights were initially stationary in the sky. As my vehicle approached and drove parallel to them, they hovered seemingly motionlessly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In relation to one another, they were positioned thusly: to the north, three lights were positioned in an obtuse triangle pattern, with the northernmost light acting as the obtuse vertex.  The other two lights were positioned farther to the south, with one higher in the sky and the other lower in the sky than the triangularly positioned lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I watched them for as long as I could as my vehicle moved farther south, away from the sky lights and the city of Eldridge. At this point, I believe that I saw the southernmost lights move. The lower light appeared to ascend and approach the upper light.  The trees were obscuring my vision at this point, so I am less confident in this part of my account than the previous paragraphs.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I believe that these lights were too high in the sky to have originated from any buildings in Eldridge, which is a relatively small town with no highrise buildings.  Also, I do not know of any terrestrial aircraft that have the ability to remain so still.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My mom briefly saw these lights, too, but she did not observe them for as long as I did.<n>

They appeared to look like stars in a triangle formation, but then we noticed they were all moving.  The center object appeared to totally stop moving, while the two outside objects continued to fly forward.  While watching them, we noticed a forth object flying behind.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They appeared to be up too high to be a helicopter and no engine noises were heard.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At about 17:05 my husband and I noticed an additional flying object.  The lights looked white and were flickering.  No red lights that are usually seen on planes were seen.  The objects appeared to be flying west to east.<n>

Each circular shape had an undetermined number of large, extemely bright red-orange lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> From my vantage point in the second story of our home on a hill, it seemed they were maybe a mile or two N.E. of us and about parallel with the tree line.  I saw them out the bedroom window as I came up for bed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I woke my husband to look out the window just as the top set of lights split off from the other two, moving slowly upward in the sky and faster than the grouping had been moving across the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As this happened they all faded at about the same time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I did not hear sound and did not see another color or shape within the colored lights.<n>

(She says like the back to the future trail left by the car).  Bright trail that slowly faded away.  At the same time the yard lit up, I was looking for cars, there were none.

I walk him outside to the sidewalk and right as I walk out, I observe how beautiful the stars are.  Right above me was the North Star and various other stars of which I don&#39;t have names for.  They were really glowing bright and I couldn&#39;t help but admire them for there hasn&#39;t been a clear night in awhile.  As I was digressing I couldn&#39;t help but notice a bright light in my peripheral vision at about  250 degrees west.  I immediately give the apparition my full attention and as quick as it manifested, it was gone in a blink.  What was amazing to me was that it almost looked like a shooting star.  I have seen many shooting stars before and I knew for a fact that it did not look like any shooting star I&#39;ve seen before.  I&#39;ve only seen shooting stars at the beach or through countryside drives; and may I remind you I live in the vast glowing city of LA where city lights would make it unlikely to see a shooting star. what I saw did not have a trail and disappeared abruptly. It did not burn out or fade away.  The best way I could describe it is that it was just as bright as the North Star and same shape, but was moving in a diagonal fashion downward towards the ground; just like a shooting star.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 3:03 AM- As I was writing this, just a little less than two hours after the incident, there was a bright blue flash in the window. The flash was relatively similar to a blue lighting flash for it had illuminated the sky.  There is clear weather and little to no clouds.  I debunked the idea of it being a car because there were no driving cars on my st as this occurred.  Another hypothesis is it could&#39;ve been a blown transformer, but I don&#39;t think this is what the light appeared like.  There was no sound.  May I remind you again, it is a clear night in the LA area.  What I saw I&#39;m not sure, that&#39;s why I&#39;m here.<n>

Right as we reached the Woodmen exit I saw something out of the corner of my eye that attracted my attention.  My daughter was driving so i was able to stare at this until it disappeared.  Up and to the left of our car I saw a very fast moving bright green/yellow ball of light that had a green trail like a commit.  I’ve seen &#34;falling stars&#34; before and it looked a lot like that in that it got bigger and brighter until it &#34;disappeared&#34; only it was bright green and it wasn’t way up in the sky. It was very low.  I know this wasn’t an optical illusion because I could see the outline of the mountain and it was definitely below the mountain line, in front of the mountain, and was parallel to the freeway at that point. I immediately stared at it as it passed our car like we were standing still.  (we were traveling at about 75mph at the time).  It came down at about a 30° angle then it disappe! ared out of my view.  It looked to me like it would have been pretty much right above Falcon Stadium at the Air Force Academy when it &#34;disappeared.&#34;  At that point I can’t tell if it landed or it actually disappeared... it was low enough at that point that it was behind trees &amp; buildings and I just couldn’t see it anymore.  This thing was completely silent.   I’ll tell ya what, it freaked me out.  I’ve never seen anything like that before.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I tried my best to recreate what I saw with a paintshop program.  Keep in mind this is a daytime google image I’m trying to make look like midnight, but the overall effect is very close to what I saw.

I took several pictures on 12megapixel Kodak camera set for low light.  I was trying to capture the Lightning. It was not until I returned home to review the pictures that I realized what I captured.  I thought initially that is was star or a pixel artifact.  I rapidly changed my mind when I noticed that it  (The pixilation spot) continued across three separate pictures.  Upon zooming I could see clearly that it was a craft. This is for real.

I first sighted this object at approximately 8:15p.m. on the night of December 13.  At first it seemed to be just another satellite as it moved through the stars.  As I followed this object I noticed it seemed to speed up then slow down.  That in itself seeming to be strange so I decided to watch it more carefully.  It was then that I was surprised to see this object slow down then come to a complete stop.  Now it had my full attention.  As I watched it further it continued to hover for approximately thirty seconds then continued on it’s path, west to east.  It continued in a straight line for another few seconds and then made an abrupt 90 degree turn to the south.  Not just a curving turn but a sharp, almost instantaneous left turn.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It then continued on this track but started a circling pattern south to east, east to north, north to west. That circular pattern, in my estimation, would have cover hundreds of miles of space.  It continued this pattern for about five to seven minutes and then abruptly shot toward the eastern horizon and disappeared.  The speeds of this object differed from very slow, barely moving to covering vast amount of space in seconds.  The following evening at about the same time (8-8:15) I was out watching for satellites and low and behold there it was again.  Same pattern, same various speeds, same sharp turn.  This continued for the next two nights so I decided to call and report this strange phenomenon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My lack of technical background will not allow me to give you any more detail of the area this object covered other than to tell you that the object covered approximately 2/3 of the night sky from about 45 degrees above horizon to almost exactly over my head (straight up).<n>
12/6/12 18:47|Denton|TX|Light|10-15 seconds|Five glowing fiery lights seen looking north from U. of North Texas campus before slowly vanishing.|12/20/12|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/095/S95025.html|582|ndxe201212| Five glowing fiery lights seen looking north from U. of North Texas campus before slowly vanishing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was walking on the campus of the University of North Texas, and as I made the corner around a building and turned due north, I saw 5 glowing, fiery, orange lights in the sky.  I don&#39;t know how far away they were or how high they were as I couldn&#39;t make out exactly what they were and therefore couldn&#39;t judge depth at all, but the angle between me and where the objects were was under 45 degrees, probably around 30 degrees.  To clarify, I was looking at the objects through telephone wires that were across the street from me, probably 30-50 feet away. I instinctively took out my phone to record a video, but unfortunately the video shows absolutely nothing.  I stopped filming after 9 seconds of video because I realized that it wasn&#39;t working properly, and as I did so the lights had already started fading.  The entire ordeal lasted probably about 15 seconds, and within 2-3 seconds after I stopped filming, all of the lights had entirely disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So to quickly summarize without unnecessary detail, there were 5 orange, fiery, glowing lights slowly moving in the sky. They were due north of the UNT campus and were drifting downwards in the sky, so I&#39;m assuming they were moving north (or falling, I guess). Some were brighter than others, but all 5 were much, much brighter than any star. Their formation didn&#39;t necessarily look organized, but it didn&#39;t exactly look scattered either, and their movements were virtually uniform. Over the course of 15 seconds, the lights faded and ceased one by one.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There is a lot of light pollution on campus, and that is why this was so startling to me at first. You could probably count the number of stars you could see from where I was on two hands because of the light pollution. If you were to look at the UNT campus map, I was walking between the Auditorium Building and Hickory Hall towards W Hickory Street, and was probably 10-15 feet in front of the Auditorium Building when I saw the UFO.  Hickory is a busy street but there was absolutely nothing that could have caused what I saw from the streets, nor from anywhere else in my surrounding environment. The only logical explanations I could come up with, outside of extraterrestrial-related things of course, are that it could have been a flare gun that I caught right as it was dissipating (which, to be frank, I do not know if that is actually a feasible explanation or not based on what I saw because I have no experience with flare guns), or that it could have been the remnants of a broken up meteorite that were burning up slowly in the atmosphere, but my issue with that theory is that they were seemingly way too bright to be that, however again, I do not know the exact details of how that looks so I can&#39;t be sure.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Ultimately, I have no explanation at the moment for what I saw. And that is both amazing and frightening.<n>

When we reached the football field, normally a great place to see the stars, we noticed a very bright light towards the east and just below Jupiter.  Within a few seconds, we both heard rotor chop and realized it was just a helicopter flying in our general direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A few moments later, and in the same general direction, we saw a meteor streak vertically downwards across the sky and burn up perhaps 10 degrees above the horizon.  As my son and I both commented on how “cool” of a sight that was, we both noticed a fuzzy patch of light above orion’s belt and just behind where the helicopter was and meteor trail had been.  This fuzzy patch grew larger until we realized it was a boomerang or chevron-shaped object moving faster and higher than the helicopter.  As it flew directly over us I noted it made no sound, had numerous equally-spaced fuzzy lights that looked like streams of whitish plasma on it front wing tips, and spanned about 5-6° of angular separation from wing-tip to wing-tip.  It moved from east to west, directly over us, and as it passed the lights on one side looked like they moved around or wavered underneath.  My son said it best in that one side appeared to “morph” into a different shape.  All I can think of is that somehow t! his thing was refracting light like crazy in order to change shape like that.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The size was impossible to determine, as I didn’t know its elevation.  It was, however, low enough (or big enough) to block out the stars behind it.  As it faded into the west, my son was both exited and scared that it might come back.  We continued on to the concert.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I teach high school science (including astronomy) and am very familiar with the local skies in this area.  This was not a jet, blimp, or anything else normal.  Not even close.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

This particular evening produced a phenomena that neither I nor my passenger could  explain.  While stopped at an intersection, I glanced at the sky and noticed four white blinking lights in the form of a &#34;V.&#34;  At first, I dismissed them as airplanes, but upon further inspection noticed that they were changing formation and did not produce any audible sound.  My passenger instructed me to pull over, and I suggested we attempt to record a video on her cellular phone as evidence.<n> <n><n> <n><n> However, the objects did not show well on the video, likely due to the abundance of street lamps overhead. Soon after, a passenger plane appeared to pass below the objects.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is when the story grew to be especially peculiar.  For the rest of the evening, my family and I heard military jets and helicopters hovering through the area, appearing to be searching for something.  This i! s unusual, as we live in a small seashore town with very little activity this time of year.<n>

The one in the back got closer to the front one.  I was concerned about a mid-air collision and pointed it out to my friend that was with me saying, &#34;That looks dangerous.  I’m surprised they’re allowed to fly that close together especially at night.&#34;  The white lights continued to get closer together and closer to where we were standing, and then slowed down a bit.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then we realized that it was not two airplanes but was one extremely big round machine with white lights on opposite sides.  The reason it looked like two planes getting closer together was because it had lights on the left and lights on the right of it and it was slowly spinning/turning giving the illusion of 2 planes getting closer.  We watched it for quite a while until it sunk below the top of the tree line until we couldn&#39;t see it anymore.   The other odd thing was that there ! was no sound whatsoever, not even after it had passed us.  Both observers are middle-aged, 1 male, 1 female, both completely sober.<n>

While we were waiting (at around 5:30 pm) my husband noticed something strange in the night sky almost directly above us.  The object had been travelling rather fast from South to North when it came to a stop and hovered. This was the Southeast area of the Las Vegas valley.  This area happens to lie directly in the flight path to McCarran airport so it’s not unusual to see aircraft.  The object appeared to be a round sphere, glowing with pulsating red light.  By the way it stopped and hovered we first thought it might be a helicopter at high altitude but it didn’t have the normal lights you’d expect to see on any known aircraft.  It simply pulsated a glowing red light.  At one point, the pulse was rather large and shortly after that there seemed to be a white halo above it for a brief moment.  Immediately following this t! he object seemed to fly straight up very quickly.  The light seemed to become more and more distant and turned a dim white color and we assumed it was heading straight up to a much higher altitude.  This assumption proved incorrect however as we began driving (watching it through the sunroof) my fist impression was that it was taking off at a high speed.  Then I realized it only seemed to be moving because we were moving.  As we made turns through the neighborhood this continued which confirmed that it could not possibly be at the high altitude we thought it had climbed to.  The light had become very faint and it was hardly discernible amid the stars, but as we traveled the stars seemed to stay stationary while this object was obviously very close to us in relation.  It was higher than the incoming airplanes but I cannot judge the altitude.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It looked at first like an airplane banking in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> But then I saw that it was shaped like three very propellers.  The &#34;banking&#34; effect was the object turning so that one of the three &#34;fins&#34; or propellers was vertical.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It glinted for a second and then seemed to vanish into the surrounding atmosphere. The object appeared to be about 5 miles away, west of the freeway.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.  PD))<n>

When we walked outside we immediately noticed how bright the stars were and how many of them we could see (We were in north central Philadelphia, near Temple university where even on the clearest nights you can hardly see stars because of the light pollution).<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were all just taking a moment to look up at the stars, marveling at our freak ability to see so many.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My friend remarked that he could see Orion&#39;s belt and that&#39;s about when I saw a dark, v shaped formation flying across the sky.  I though at first it was a flock of geese, especially since it was moving south east, but I quickly realized it wasn&#39;t.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As soon as I said &#34;whoah, look at that planet&#34;; I realized it wasn&#39;t a plane at all, there were no lights on it and it was flying very low to the ground (maybe 600 or 700 feet in the air at most) it was also completely silent.<n> <n><n> <n><n> (Just to be clear, we live near 2 air ports, we see taking off/landing planes all the time, daily, and this is not what they look like)   As soon as I pointed out the &#34;plane,&#34; then quickly corrected myself and said &#34;wait no, there&#39;s no lights on it, hold on..; it was out of sight.  It was moving silently, gliding, but it was moving at a pretty good speed.  My other two friends who had seen it confirmed how strange it was and we tried to run down the street to keep up with it, but lost sight due to the bright street lights and buildings in our way.<n>

I told him I had heard it before, but had never seen it due to its only at night and always above the cloud cover.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We went outside to see an object with lights on it in the sky, this time flying no more than 100ft above the tree tops.  My friend said it was a helicopter at which time I told him to listen closely. no chopping could be heard once it came into view.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It sounded more like a hover craft. the chopping was due to the sound bouncing off of the other houses as it was approaching. the lights at the tail end of plane were consistent proper aviation code, green and red. the light at the front of the aircraft was white as if a spot light, but did not project itself to the ground. it lite up the sky in front of the craft as well as the tree tops in a wide fashion.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Both me and my friend agreed this was nothing like anything we had ever seen or heard about.

I looked up and saw three to four orange yellow lights traveling south west.  The did not blink or hover, but continued to move and change direction and formation, although to my wife it looked like one craft turning.  I live next to an air base but didn&#39;t hear any noise from the craft.  I did see an airplane after the objects disappeared, but it was much further away.<n>

One very fast.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was in my truck driving west on I-76 near US 202 on 12/05/2012 at aprox. 9:30PM, when I saw 3 extra bright lights following each other like planes do when they are in a flight path.  They were probably about a mile or 2 high and about a half mile apart, but it was hard to tell from the ground.  (It may have been less becuse i could see the objects fairly well, even at night.) What was strange was how much light was coming from them on all sides of the objects.  I said there were 30 witnesses, because other drivers on the highway were slowing down to look at them and several had pulled over to the shoulder and were standing outside their cars.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The lights were dazzlingly bright and were shining away from the craft on all sides like spotlights and were so bright that I could see that the objects were oval and greenish white overall with no windows.  I also slowed down and observed a stranger thing.  The lead light/object made an abrupt left turn almost 270 degrees and headed directly toward the second light.  The second light never changed course or speed, but the one that turned accelerated to an unbelievable speed and shot past the second one so closely that I thought they would collide.  For an instant, both craft were lit up by a little more and I saw them better.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The one that sped up, continued to increase speed until it almost instantly disappeared past the tree/hill line.  I never saw anything move that fast before or turn like that, including all of the jets I&#39;d seen at Air shows.  I had opened my window early on to see better and also noticed that the craft were completely silent.  I exited the highway onto S. Gulph Rd and could see the 2 remaining craft very distinctly through the tree branches and again when I stopped on Croton Rd and watched them until they too disappeared over the tree line.  All the while, other drivers were slowing and stopping to see them from every angle.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am a 52 year old retired computer technician, now raising and training dogs.  I may have seen strange lights in the sky and have watched meteor showers and such in remote areas, but this was unlike any other experience I&#39;ve had and it was over a major highway and a moderately populated area.  I don&#39;t usually see many planes in this area, but sometimes there are traffic helicopters around during the day.<n>

As I was pulling closer to this object it started to flash, and before I could even get a camera ready to get some footage of it my girlfriend screaming out, &amp;quot;What the hell is that!?&amp;quot;   The object she saw was clearly a single bent saucer shape.  It had a row of four lights, with the two outside lights set slightly lower and to the side of the two in the middle.  It was incredibly low in the sky, lower than any of the planes which fly along a similar path from DIA.  The object was so low that I got a pretty good estimate of it&#39;s size, I&#39;d say it was about 60&#39; wide, about two houses.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As soon as I saw it I turned onto a road that ran right underneath it to try to get some pictures or video of it, and as soon as I turned onto the road I saw the four lights grow brighter and the entire object just sort of swooped down over the houses and shot off towards the mountains.  I floored it to try to keep up with it, got up to over 60MPH in a residential zone trying to catch up to it and it still shot away from me like I was standing still.<n>

In that general location there was what appeared to be another star.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 6:02  Suddenly it got twice as bright an appeared to get at least twice its normal size.  I was able to compare its size it was close to the brightest star in the east.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It darted up from 4 o’clock to 11 o’clock track.  It had a trail like a shooting star.  It went a distance then bright light went out an it went back to normal size an normal brightness compared to a star an stopped.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 6:05  After it stopped I could now see a red haze on it along with the white light. It began to move around like hovering in a circle motion counter clock wise.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 6:10 I walked backed into my house to get phone and take a pic. I was away from watching for maybe 10sec.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I came back out it had now went into the tree line of my sight. I walked off my porch 15 feet to the north to get a better view around trees and houses.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 6:13 I could not focus on anything to grainy and blurry.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There is a water tower 1 mile away that has a red light on top of it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object now had 2 flashing white lights on it. 1 on the right and 1 on the left. In the center was 1 single red light. They all began to flash.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The outside lights would flash then the center light. It appeared to be moving towards me coming west behind the trees. Its lights were very clear an sharp compared to the light on the water tower.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My first thought was its coming back to go to the airport which is 2 miles west of me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 6:15 It came within a distance then appeared to back up and go back to the west never rising.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I could still see it as it was going back west never rising again.  I lost sight of it through the houses an trees.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 6:20 The lights were clearer on it compared to the light on the water tower.  I could tell there was a distance between the outside lights compared to the middle light.  It must have been long to see each light separately.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I never heard a sound from it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have a lot of land marks to measure height in the sky to distance it traveled.  I base this on the houses and the trees.<n>

While it wasn&#39;t a fireball it&#39;s colors were reddish orange and was extremely bright.  It seemed to be moving slowly and southeast in direction.  Its path never changed direction as it flew directly over my building. I followed it until it flew out of view over trees and other buildings.

The aircraft looked to be a huge star at first until I noticed it was rotating counterclockwise with 5 different lights shining bright.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As the &#34;UFO&#34; starts to move more towards Louisville another aircraft appeared from a distance.  The 2 &#34;UFO&#34; began to go up and down and side tot side in a very smooth motion.  There were other aircraft flying overhead of this arriving and departing from Louisville International Airport.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I lost sight of the &#34;UFOs&#34; at 11:57pm after they had crossed the Ohio River to only show them selfs 4mins later with 3more &amp;quot;UFOs&amp;quot; before speeding away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I checked Louisville International Airport&#39;s flight reports which showed a UPS plane had problems and had to do an emergency landing from &#34;...the smell of fumes on the aircraft.&#34;<n>

It was like a single headlight was shining toward me. I turned right down coliseum and as I drove the object followed to the left of me.  I must have seen it from a different angle then because the bright light was gone and instead there were two white lights and a blinking red one in the middle.  At first I thought it was a helicopter but then when I stopped at the light so did it. It was the strangest thing. I pulled into the nearby parking lot and sort of followed it.  It hovered a while and then sank down behind a hill.  I could see the outline of a sort of 3d diamond shape though.  I&#39;ve never seen anything like this before.  But I did see a lady next to me watching it too so at least I know I&#39;m not crazy right (:<n>

It was heading West and it looked like an airplane or jet violently flying, as if it were about to crash. It was pretty low to the ground, but not dangerously close.  The object had dim lights (like those of an airplane or jet) and they were spiraling and moving around everywhere with the tumbling aircraft.  I can&#39;t remember if the lights were blinking or not.  The aircraft left a jet stream (or what seemed to be a trail of smoke or something) in the sky for about 5 minutes before it faded away. I was waiting for this &#39;plane&#39; to crash and make an explosion, but it just spiraled out of view.  As I was watching it, I almost called 911 or the police to report what I saw in case it was in fact a plane crashing.  But because I saw no impact, or explosion, I didn&#39;t call. I called my father and my words wer! e &amp;quot;I think I just saw an airplane crash&amp;quot;. The object was visible in the sky for about 20 seconds. The jet stream it left stayed in the sky for a good 5 minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The weird thing about what I saw is my friend (also from Morrison, IL) saw the same exact thing as I did at about 11:45PM. He posted a facebook status about what he saw and I IMMEDIATELY called him and had him describe to me what he saw and it was EXACTLY the same thing as what I witnessed. There was a few differences in what he saw, though. The object he saw flew East, the opposite direction of the craft I saw. Also, he told me as he watched the aircraft fly over the town of Morrison, the power went out citywide for a good 15-20 seconds while it was overhead, and as soon as it disappeared, the power went back on. He explained it the same way I did, a violently moving aircraft of some sort that was not flying straight at all and left a jet steam.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Also, this is a different friend&#39;s status besides the two stated above: &#34;I would say I just saw a shooting star, but no shooting star moves like that.&#34;   Here is a comment he made about what he saw: &#34;Didnt have colors that i could tell. It looked like a shooting star, but it stopped.  Then went the other way.  Then it was gone.  Right when i looked up.&#34;<n>

I ran inside to get my camera and alerted my 10 year daughter, 16 year old son and my girlfriend. the craft began to move slowly east and began to flicker.  Immediately after flickering two craft dropped out of the craft and descended straight down until no longer visible.  My attempts to film only ended with short unfocused videos because its a new camera and I was unable to focus quickly enough.  The craft then blinked out and immediately teleported west a few miles, then blinked out again and was gone.<n>

It had several dark thick and thin lines.  Some were very thick and dark and other were faint and almost looked cellular and like it had veins.  The object hovered for some time.  Meanwhile we also saw several military jets flying in the area, but lower.  I googled &#34;doughnut shaped UFOs&#34; and saw several images that were similar to what we saw.  The object appeared to drop or shoot something out of it a couple of times.  The UFO also had light, but I do not think its the same type of light that our aircraft has, it was almost like the whole thing glowed blue.  I do stargaze quite a bit and I would say that the object was quite large and very bright from the ground, yet it appeared to glow once we saw it through the telescope.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We have amended the date above to December 04, 2012.

They were hovering lower than a plane would fly, but higher than the tree line.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The orbs were larger in size than any aircraft lights I&#39;ve ever seen-I&#39;d estimate about twice the size of a landing airplane&#39;s lights.  There were 3 lights/orbs in a slightly arched triangular form, then a 4th orb appeared between the 1st and 2nd orb.  They weren&#39;t moving, just hovering and glowing. They were visible for less than one minute and then vanished.  I saw a very diminished light blue colored streak appear for a millisecond and it was gone.  My mother said she saw it too but dismissed it as an airplane for lack of explanation/perception on the matter.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Our vehicle was the only one in the area, except for a pick-up truck that was in front of us aways.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am retired law enforcement, my husband is active law enforcement, and we are experienced in responding to all sorts of strange calls about lights, fireworks, etc...but nothing I have ever seen has ever looked like these orbs.<n> <n><n> <n><n> However, approximately 10-11 yrs ago, on the same road traveling the opposite direction I had an experience seeing some strange lights above the tree line and then for 2 hours I was &#34;hypnotized&#34; in some sort of trance like state.  My fiancé witnessed this and informed me that I spoke to him the entire 2 hours but was not &#34;myself.&#34;   He said when I got home I went directly to bed and slept for 2 days.<n>

It was approximately 7pm.  I was on Weld County Road 100, approximately half way between Wellington and Nunn Colorado.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I glanced to the south and saw three strange lights in the sky.  They looked a bit like stars in the sky but were much brighter, and there were not many stars visible at that time.  The lights were arranged in a triangle pattern.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My first thought was it was just the lights of the large radio towers south of my house.  (Weld County road 27 and Weld County Road 90).  I was driving so I pulled over to the side of the road.  Once I was stopped I was able locate the red lights of the radio tower and they were NOT the three mysterious lights that I was seeing.  The lights were higher in the sky and further west then the radio tower lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I watched the lights and I was trying to grasp what they could be.  Nothing in my mind fit what I was seeing.  They were not stars, they were not earthly aircraft.  As I stared with amazement the lights, which had been stationary in the sky, spun in the sky together in a circular motion two full revolutions then the three lights took off in different directions from each other.  The speed at which they exited my view was faster than anything I have ever witnessed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I waited about 2 minutes to see if I could see them again.  I did not.  I am not sure what it is that I was looking at, and I have done some simple google searches to see if there others that may have witnesses what I did.  I have found nothing.<n>

For help in identifying these craft I have contacted TV stations in Sioux Falls and even NORAD but no one has responded.  So, perhaps you folks can help.

12/4/12 11:00|Westboro|MO|Disk|30 minutes|A blue, flat, hovering object and a red-ish flash in the sky appear over our town.|12/20/12|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/094/S94986.html|635|ndxe201212| A blue, flat, hovering object and a red-ish flash in the sky appear over our town.<n> <n><n> <n><n> UFO Sighting<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first my father saw a flash in the sky.  Only thinking it was a falling star he watched longer and it appeared to be a red-ish flame in an electrical ball that ran across the sky.  It was on the edge of the little town we live in.  It seemed to be fairly close to us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After looking at the object for a longer time, the ball looked like it conducted electricity and had sparks in the inside. It only lasted a couple of minutes than it disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My father then came running inside saying he saw the same object in the sky as he did last year in the same town during summer. Him, his girlfriend and I walked back outside to see what was going on.  In the far distance there was a blue object hovering in the sky; as my dad called it, &#34;The Mother ship.&#34;<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object looked flat and was tinted blue.  His girlfriend pointed out the UFO had blue lights all around it and just the bottom part was spinning around.  I noticed it too after a while.  The lights underneath the aircraft were blue also, but disappeared every now and then.  We could not tell how far the aircraft was but it was right beside another light.  To me it looked like a light tower or a service pole.  This is not the only time we have spotted this or another kind of strange object in the sky around our small county.<n>
12/4/12 09:30|Albuquerque|NM|Diamond|30 minutes|Black diamond shaped ufo seen over hovering about 300-400 feet over city.|2/4/13|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/096/S96162.html|636|ndxe201212| black diamond shaped ufo seen over hovering about 300-400 feet over city.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was 9:30 and it was a crystal clear blue sky, sunny day.  I was walking by the window at work and i casually noticed a black crow flying by and it caught my eye, so i looked at the bird and after it had passed the window i noticed a black diamond shaped object off in the distance.  The object also caught my eye because it wasn&#39;t moving, instead it just sat there.  It was then that I took the time to go outside in the parking lot for a better look. Immediately I noticed that it was not moving up or down or left to right.  It was however, rotating in place slowly. I was trying to make sense that maybe this was a kite, but there was no wind and it was clearly rotating.  Plus, the area at which it was hovering over was all industry and a very busy intersection, so no kid would be flying their kite in that area.  Then, i decided to get a few employees to come look at it to see if they would have an answer.  They were just as stunned as me. I even got a customer to co! me look at it and they too were stunned.  As I focused more and more on its detail, I noticed it had a haze around it and the surface reflected light because when an area of the object rotated into the light, it reflected it, looking smooth and metallic. There may have been a light on one tip of the &#34;diamond&#39; but I couldn&#39;t be for sure.  Eventually it started to drift to my left and up slowly, and it got to about 600 ft or more, and by this time I knew it couldnt have been a kite because it crossed over the busy street it was hovering over and drifted like 1 block left. no kite string could be that long. This area is a very busy place and other people had to have seen this that morning.<n>

For over the past thirty minutes I have seen a bright light between Orion&#39;s Belt and the horizon, south-southeast from my location.  From the naked eye, it looks like the shimmering of colored light you get when you look at an airplane with it&#39;s red and green lights flashing in the distance, but it has barely moved.  A friend had told me it moved a short distance before stopping again all before he contacted me to take a look for myself.  The best way to describe the view from the naked eye is that of an atom.  Imagine seeing white light like a star (atom) with red, green and blue electrons whirring around it like quick lights flashing on a police car.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Looking through a telescope, it appeared as if there could be one light, or several ones close together.  It looked like there were three lights formed into some kind of triangular shape, but I didn&#39;t have sufficient magnification to make out a distinct arrangement.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At one point, I thought I had seen this triangular shape turning and transforming, like an unstable particle in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Other witnesses besides myself are 2 friends of mine, one of which told me and the other I informed myself, and a friend of one of them from Texas.<n>

12/3/12 03:24|Thousand Oaks|CA|Flash|30+ minutes|Loud sound and a search light coming from sky - definitely not a helicopter.|12/20/12|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/095/S95012.html|650|ndxe201212| Loud sound and a search light coming from sky - definitely not a helicopter.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On the 2nd I was awoken by a whirring sound. I wake up around 3AM often, so I&#39;m not sure if it was the sound that woke me or if it was natural.  The sound was alike to a lawn mower, and got louder and then would fade at random. When it came close at one point, I saw lights flashing in my room and through the trees.  When I looked out, it was too dark to see, but the light was coming from the sky. It went over many houses, I thought it was a helicopter, but the sound was more unreal. It had more bass in it, and a higher frequency. It was definitely not a helicopter.  The light specifically kept pointing in a tree in my neighbors yard, not at me or my window, but it did go into my window and then into my bathroom&#39;s window too. It scared me pretty badly, and I was unable to sleep till it ended around 4. Sometimes the lights would change colors, and my electricity kept going out.  There was a light trail in the sky after it left but it faded quickly.<n>
12/3/12 02:30|Miami|FL|Light|3 minutes|Red lights flying over Miami, Florida, December 3rd 2012.|12/20/12|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/094/S94936.html|651|ndxe201212| Red lights flying over Miami, Florida, December 3rd 2012<n> <n><n> <n><n> On December 3rd, 2012, at approximately 2:30am, I was driving south on Miami&#39;s 826/Palmetto expressway. I had left my best friend&#39;s house after watching a movie. While on the highway I noticed maybe 10-13 red lights in the night sky. Because my car was dustier than usual due to local construction, I had to roll down my driver&#39;s window to get a clearer view.  The red lights seemed so out of place I decided to stop the car and parked it on the emergency lane. They were fairly low, close to the western horizon and they were slowly moving due south.  They were spread out but maintained their places, all appearing to move at the same speed. They reminded me of aircraft in formation but the pattern was irregular, rather like a constellation&#39;s shape.  They were essentially red lights, and were only slightly larger than any star in the sky and they seemed to twinkle softly as stars do.  Because I didn&#39;t have a great camera on me, I called my best friend on my cell phone! and told him to run out and look west.  But as he was getting out of his apartment, they all began to fade slowly and one after another until they disappeared entirely.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As an artist, I consider myself an extremely open-minded person. But I try to approach such situations with a rational mind.  I have never before seen anything like this in person.  I am also sure there must have been several people who witnessed this.  The lights covered at least a sixth of the night sky. While there wasn&#39;t a great deal of traffic at 2:30am, the city wasn&#39;t entirely asleep either.  Anyone driving due west on several roads would have seen these lights gliding overhead.  I don&#39;t drink nor do I take any hallucinogenic drugs and I was wide awake when I witnessed this.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As soon as I got home, I immediately went online to see if there was any news of a meteor shower or maybe a satellite burning up and found nothing. I did find an article on a British news site of what is &amp;quot;believed to be&amp;quot; a recent meteor shower.  But the pictures show a phenomenon that looks entirely different.  I then googled pictures of meteors and similar events and again, completely different images came up. When finally going on youtube at about 3:30am, I searched for the terms &amp;quot;red+lights+sky&amp;quot; and found a few videos showing lights over Galveston and Farmingdale and finally found a match for what I saw!  While mysteries make life more exciting, explanations can be more comforting. I would very much like an answer to this one. It was beautiful but slightly unsettling.<n>

The object was round and  was sparkly, it left a light trail behind it. It disappeared below the tree line.  It lasted about 15-20 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Shortly after that maybe 2-3 mins later my husband and I saw a bright round object bigger and brighter than a star appeared from the south at a high elevation and desended to the north and slowly faded and disappeared.<n>

I was watching TV, which sits just to the right of a South facing window.  Something caught my eye and I noticed from the above mentioned window, a blackish &#34;V&#34; (almost like a small Stealth fighter) shaped craft, moving from right to the left (West to East).<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first, I thought it was a kite, but it was moving very fast.  When it moved out of sight, due to the window;s edge...<n> <n><n> <n><n> I quickly shifted my gaze towards a East face window and caught it moving away at a very brisk speed.  I heard no noise what-so-ever, nor did I notice any lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Although my wife was with me, she did not see or here anything.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Just a note for whom it my concern.  My house is only a few miles west of Nellis Air Force Base, which (in my opinion) was the direction the craft was heading towards.  Creech Air Force Base is also within 20 miles of my house and the is the home of unmanned aircraft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I suppose it could have been a military craft, but I consider myself very familiar with today&#39;s modern aircraft (both manned and unmanned) and I&#39;ve never seen anything like this before.<n>

I was afraid that the puppy might go to the bathroom in the bed, so I decided to go ahead and take her outside to go use the bathroom.  We walked around the back of the house first and then to the front of the house.  I live in the country, so my neighbors arent close.  Across the street in my neighbors field.  I saw and oval shaped object with 6 orangey red lights around it.  Hovering about 100 ft off the ground.  There was no sound and it did not move.  Of course I was frightened so I grabbed the puppy and went into the house. I waited for my husband to come home from work.  I did not see the object leave.<n>

Upon getting out I looked up and saw four to six fire ball shaped objects flying fairly low and not very fast.  Then approximately 100-200 yards behind were two more bringing up the rear.  All objects were heading north.<n>

They were in a triangle formation with three lights forming one side.  The longest side of the triangle ran parallel to the flight path of the object or objects.  The lights were steady, not blinking.  The object/s were silent, fast moving and maintained a perfect formation until they dissapeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It may have been a single object, but I think it was four.<n>
12/1/12 18:55|Dayton|OH|Formation|10 minutes|9-12 objects in apparent  formation black and firey orange circular on bottom/photos and video captured|12/20/12|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/094/S94982.html|667|ndxe201212| 9-12 objects in apparent  formation black and firey orange circular on bottom/photos and video captured<n> <n><n> <n><n> Last Saturday night (1 December 2012) shortly before 7:00pm, I was leaving home to go to a local store on Valley Street to purchase some cigarettes and play a few lottery numbers.  This store is located in Dayton / Riverside Ohio, and very close to Wright Patterson Air Force Base.  Dad is currently buried at the local VAMC and is retired Air Force.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I stepped outside and was going to get into my car, I noticed a strange object flying overhead and breaking into a turning pattern to the right and upwards movement.  I thought to myself how odd and I wish I had my digital camera.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I thought oh well, it is gone and I missed my chance to get it on tape.  No sooner than that happened and I was getting into my car, I noticed that there were three more of these flying vessels identical to the first. (All of these objects seem to have the same flight path / plan).  At this time I took out my cell phone to try and capture still images or video.  Oddly enough, I was able to capture a photo of three of the objects in one still frame photo.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I thought to myself, oh well at least I got a still image photo and will look at it later.  I put down the phone and backed out of the drive-way, pulled forward and made an immediate right-turn and proceeded to travel down a street that I drive down everyday.  Oddly, enough I didn&#39;t get very far and I observed more of these strange looking vessels coming my way.  I slowed down to a stop on the right side of the roadway and started capturing what I could on my cell phone again.  This amounted to a few still images and a few short segments of video.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Once the last one went by, I called my mother on my cell phone and told her to go outside and look up to see if she saw a UFO.  She did, but was unable to see anything.  She stated that it was cloudy outside.  From experience I know these objects do become obscure by clouds sometimes.  Even in the video footage that I was able to capture, clouds can be observed in the night sky.  Another strange thing is that there seems to be a moon like glow coming from over top of the clouds.  Therefore, it is possible that there could have been an obscure mother ship in the vicinity.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I could tell these UFOs were not regular jets as the lighting was different looking.  There were no airplane lights mounted on them blinking at all.  There is always aircraft in this area and you will see their lights twinkle when flying over-head, or off in the distance.<n> <n><n> <n><n> NOTE: The objects were dark on the top and firey orange and circular on the bottom.  The power source seemed to be coming from the bottom area and you could look up into it and observe a circular pattern.  The objects appeared to be some type of circular shape.  It is so astonishing to look at something for such a brief period of time and try to rationalize what you are looking at.  I am so use to the after-burn being on the back-end of a flying vessel that it was very puzzling.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Strangely enough during this event I did note other regular jets flying at much higher altitudes but off to the far right and left sides of these vessels.  When I think about it all, it makes since that they would break off.  This is a populated area and I think it would be very bad to intercept or try to intercept these objects over our cities, unless we had no choice.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is just my opinion and is based on what I observed.  I can&#39;t say what the military or civil agencies had up and flying in the area during this time.  I did not contact anyone at Wright Patterson Air Force Base, been there done that.  I have been involved with UFO Research off and on since 1983.  This is the first time in all those years that I have been able to capture photographic images.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I did some brief internet searches utilizing key words pertaining to what I witnessed and the first search turned up positive and interesting results.  I am submitting this report to various UFO Agencies within the USA as they are trained in working with the Public and private citizens in this field of research.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am a US Veteran and if called upon to work with the Government, I would gladly do so and assist in anyway I could.<n>
12/1/12 18:50|Dayton|OH|Formation|10 minutes|Formation of at least 9 flying vessels flying a unique precise pattern and flight path. Circular/Crown Shaped.|12/20/12|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/095/S95004.html|668|ndxe201212| Formation of at least 9 flying vessels flying a unique precise pattern and flight path. Circular/Crown Shaped<n> <n><n> <n><n> Last Saturday about 6:50pm (1 December 2012) I was leaving home heading to a local store to get in a few lottery tickets.  No sooner than I had came outside to get into my car.  I looked up into the sky as I noticed a light being emitted from some type of flying craft.  I was thinking that one seems a bit unusual as it turned and went out of view.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I thought to myself, I wish I had my digital camcorder or something.  I felt as though I had missed a chance to obtain a nice shot of a UFO.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Just as I got ready to get into my car, I noticed three more of these objects, first there was one, then two, then three.  I paused for a moment took out my cell phone and captured a still photo image of the vessels.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was able to capture all three in the frame of my cell phone.  As they went out of sight I got into my car backed out of the drive way made an almost immediate right turn and headed straight down the street.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I noticed there appeared to be more objects approaching.  They also went as far as the others and turned into a right bank and out of view.  By this time I was wondering if more were coming as I had already see at least four.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I slowed down my car reaching for my cell phone again and started taking photographic images.  I pulled over and stopped on the right hand side of the road.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I managed to capture a couple more still images.  Then I slipped my phone (trail and error) into video mode and managed to capture even more evidence of this rare event.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The first video displays an object approaching as if it is coming up out of a cloud and it makes me wonder if there was a mother ship over top of the cloud and obscured from sight.  In the first video it is so short that you can barely see the lead UFO moving.  However, I filmed a second video which was about 52 seconds long.  This video clearly shows at least three of the objects coming from the same direction and approaching my direction but off to the left (drivers side of the vehicle).<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was able to capture some of the objects approaching and observed them flying the same pattern in the same formation as the rest. All of the objects that I could clearly see, looked the same. The bottom was a bright fiery color and was circular.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Now that I think about it, it reminds me of a crown. The top portion of the vehicles was darkened into the night sky and they were all seemed to be hollow at the bottom and with an intense uniform fiery glow.<n> <n><n> <n><n> These vessels seemed like their power source was centered at the bottom of the crafts and circular.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In the first still image that I captured you can see a portion of what I described as crowned.  I did not note any navigation signaling lights and this is clearly displayed in the video I was able to capture.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I did not bother to call the authorities or the local Air Base as I have already been there and done that years ago.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I figure they are not going to tell me anything, at least not at this time. I would like to state that I would love to be working for the Government in this line of work.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I do have experience as a Police Officer and was called to a UFO seen way back in 1983.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is the first time I have ever been able to capture UFO footage. I have lived around Military Installations my entire life and I have flown overseas three times.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I see many aircraft around here and the all fly with navigation lights and these objects did not.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I would estimate that there were about 9 - 12 uniform objects that were involved and in plain view. It is like they just rolled in and the airspace and sector was all theirs. I was so busy focusing on the UFOs and trying to obtain photographic evidence, that I didn&#39;t even pay much attention to the normal aircraft in the area.<n>

I was looking left because there was a giant rainbow that was terminating somewhere near the middle of the lake on the eastern shore.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Flying slowly from East to West, north of both bridges i could see a shiny round object slowly making it&#39;s way across the sky.  I am very good at identifying planes, but this shape was not identifiable as traditional air plane.  I could not see any wings or anything that looked like a nose or a tail of the plane.  I&#39;m not sure if it was light grey, or just was just shiny and reflecting what light was there.  I can&#39;t have been the only person to see this craft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Everyone on the i90 bridge at that time would have noticed the giant rainbow and then maybe seen the same craft.  I would love to hear from anyone who might have seen it from the 520 bridge, so i can pin point where exactly it was.<n> <n><n> <n><n> If it was flying between the too bridges then i&#39;d say it was not a very large craft.  It was north of the 520 bridge it might have been very large.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Also this craft was not on any of the usual flight paths for the seattle area.<n>
