Just wanted to make sure you heard about it. As I was driving here in North Carolina I was listening to WLW in Cincinnati. Several callers called in with reports of a silent triangular craft that flew over earlier that evening. Their reports were all consistent with each other and they sounded like solid middle aged, middle class adults not playing a Halloween prank. Coincidentally there was a power blackout and a radar shutdown the same evening which delayed some flights into Cincinnati.<n>

I looked about 100 feet away and i saw a green thing floating from the sky...i didn&#39;t know what it was but i noticed it fell from something so i looked up to see what it fell from.  It was a disk shaped craft and had lights going all around it...i was so scared and in shock because i have seen UFO&#39;s before.

It was rapidly moving much faster than a satellite.  I asked my husband and my father what they thought it was. It was very bright, brighter than any star in the sky.  We had no idea what It could have been.  My daughter became scared and we went home.<n>

As we came around the curve, I saw the disc shaped object just long enough to make out the shape and see the beautiful lights on it.  It was a perfectly round shape, flat on top and on bottom, with lights going all around the edges.<n> <n><n> <n><n> These lights had the most beautiful color and it was a color I still have a hard time identifying (I have never seen the same exact color in my lifetime and I am now 45 yrs old). The color that comes closest to matching would be a mix of gray and purple with a misty pink hue to it.  It was brilliant and really beautiful.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The lights seemed to be circling the craft, but could have been blinking. I did not hear any noise with this sight at all.  This was only within my sight for a brief but exciting minute!<n> <n><n> <n><n> It flew off at a left angle then made a sharp right, around the bend at the bridge and was gone in the fog, moving very fast.  One of my daughters friends was in the front with me and she and I discussed it again last month.  She barely remembers because they were young teens, but she does remember me saying &#34;Look, there&#39;s a UFO!&#34;  My excitement over UFO&#39;s all my life made this VERY exciting for me, I really did not have any fear.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After reaging about the Chicago O&#39;Hare Airport sighting and finding your link, I made the decision to report it here.  Felt it was important to add it to the list of US sightings.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date of sighting may be approximate, although the witness does not indicate that fact.  PD))<n>

Her boyfriend was riding with us. I was heading south on Kenilworth Avenue. Out of the blue we saw a strange craft going from left to right (Heading from East to West)It was about the speed of a plane. Appeared to be 10,000 feet in the air. It kept going. My friend and I were amazed at what we saw.<n>
10/31/00 19:15|Cygnet|OH|Egg|45 Minutes|The ship crossed the sky, stopped shot up about a half mile, hovered for a while and changed a multitude of colors and departed with us|12/2/00|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/014/S14774.html|7|ndxe200010| The ship crossed the sky, stopped shot up about a half mile, hovered for a while and changed a multitude of colors and departed with us<n> <n><n> <n><n> At 7:15 p.m. we were heading North on I-75 just south of Cygnet, Ohio, when we saw what appeared to be a meteor coming across the horizon from the east and out of space.  It crossed over I-75 heading west, when an explosion or emission of somekind, lit behind it, illuminating the craft.  This event, looked not like an explosion proper, but rather orange, yellow and a sparkling gold bolt of lighting with many branches!<n> <n><n> <n><n> At that moment it came to a quick stop but quite a distance from the previous anomalous event.  This took all of 5 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At this point we stopped the vehicle and went for the video camera.  We tried to turn it on, but the battery was dead.  So we pulled out binoculars we took for the trip and started watching its movements.  I pulled out the binoculars and handed them to my friend ((deleted)), and when I turned around to look back at the craft, I saw a flash of white light, and then the ship moved up approximately a half mile.  That is where it stayed, until we decided to move in, and then it stayed with the car up to the Cygnet Rd. exit.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At this point, the object was hovering what looked to be a hundred feet above the trees.  We turned off onto the Cygnet exit, and turned left onto Cygnet.   We pulled the car over on the right hand side of the road, and started to observe the craft, at this point a woman named ((female name deleted)) stopped in front of us and asked us if we saw the previous events.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We exchanged names and numbers and watched the ship hover with the binaculars. She explained that she was on a pizza run, and she had to go, we agreed to meet back at her pizza shop after investigating the &#34;UFO&#34;.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At this point it was turning a multitude of colours, including red, blue, green, white, magenta and yellow.  It was also dimming and then get brighter.  So she departed, and we went in to investigate.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Once we got close enough, we stopped to investigate even more.   We observed it again change colours and reduce and increase in size (from dimming, we believe)<n> <n><n> <n><n> All of a sudden, it became an intense red, and Jim l ooked at me and said, &#34;Tim, let&#39;s go, I don&#39;t like the way that this is looking&#34;, and as he said that I said &#34;were going&#34; just then, I looked at the lights in the jeep and they were starting to dim and get brighter and the dim again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I turned the jeep around and we drove as fast as we could go.  We kept a eye on it upon our departure, we went back to the pizza store to meet up with ((female name deleted)).  She arrived, we confirmed the story to her friends at the pizza store and then told her what happend.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Afterwards, we left to go and see if the ship was still there.   At that point it was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We entered back onto the freeway, and all of a sudden we both developed pain in our abdominal region right below the rib cage.   Mine was off the left side, and Jim&#39;s was more in the center.  Later I looked at my side and it was inflamed and red.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am a classical piano teacher Jim is a Carpenter<n>

It was going from the east going west.  Then a spark came out of it, and it looked like fire, then it stopped.  We pulled to the side of the road and got out with binaculars and looked through the binaculars at the craft.  And then I gave them to ((name deleted)).  Then we got back in the jeep and we started driving off to the exit.  While we were looking at the ship/craft, it seemed like it was following us.  So we got off, and turned left going west.  We went down the Cygnet Rd. then we stopped over the bridge and I was looking through the binaculars once again.  I saw the ship, it was turning red, green, yellow and white.  Then, another car pulled up, and stopped in front of us and the woman got out and asked if we seen what she seen.  I said &#34;yes!&#34; so, I walked over to her and gave her the binaculars.  She looked and seen the same thing.  Then she got back into her car, because she had to ((deleted)), and told us where the ((deleted)) place was.  I walked back to the jeep, and looked up once again at the ship, and got in the car and looked through the binaculars once again.  Once again I saw red, green, yellow, white and blue.  Then, the ship seemed to go down into the tree and then come back up.  Then it got very red/dark red and then I got scared and got this feeling inside, and I looked at ((name deleted)) and said, &#34;Lets get out of here!&#34;  Then we started driving and I was looking back at the ship as we were going east to ((deleted)) where the woman works.  We waited for her to come back from ((deleted)).  Then ((deleted)) asked her what she seen.  We got back into the jeep and went back to see if it was still there, it was not. We started back on I75 going north when both of us at the same time got a sharp pain in our abdomin.  Mine was in the middle just below my ribs, and his was on the left side.  Then once we got home, he dropped me off, I went into the house sat down for a bit, and then I heard odd noises as if someone was whispering a m! umbled l anguage.  My father also heard it and I looked out the door and no-one was there!  That was about it. I am a ((deleted)) ((deleted)) is a ((deleted)) teacher<n>

It was heading to the Southwest projecting a small tail of white fire. It was bright white and about 50 degrees above the horizon. When it reached the zenith of its trajectory, some part of it fell off like molten white hot steel dripping to the ground. I didn&#39;t see anything really unusual about it. I figured it was a meteor or space debris skipping the upper atmosphere. It disappeared about 15 to 20 degrees above the horizon in the southwest, which made me think it went back into space or burned up.<n>

We looked up at what we thought was a shooting star. It stopped and then fell straight down towards the horizon at a slow speed. We paid special attention because it was moving so slowly and straight, unlike any other &#34;shooting star&#34; we&#39;ve seen before. Never thought much about it until I heard about this web page and read a similar story. I&#39;ve heard stories in the past that Pickering in a hot spot for sighting, I guess because of the Nuclear Power Planet.<n>

We stopped cause the child was at a door.  We were looking down the street and we saw in the sky, a star - or so we thought.  It appeared to be a shooting star heading SW, but it stopped dead in the sky and then just started falling straight down.  The reason why this was so strange to us was because it stopped and went in an exact straight line down into the horizan till we couldn&#39;t see it cause of trees - it wasn&#39;t a fast fall either.  We stood there for what seems like 30 secs watching this thing fall. I&#39;m surprised not more people noticed it was so weird to see something falling straight down. We looked at each other and commented on how weird it was.  He is a huge skeptic yet believed this was something out of the norm. This event has bothered me ever since, so I came on the internet to look up UFOs  and sure enough I found this site.  And I notice there were other weird sightings on Halloween.  Could they be related? I never told anyone this story but I&#39;ve seen the same thing about 12 years ago, looking out the window one night.  I run down to tell my mother who thought I was kidding..  The next morning she ran to my room saying that the news had reporting several UFO sightings from all over - that night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Please see other reports from the Midwest for this time and date.

Nothing wrong with this, but about 1/2 hour later I see a formation of what appears to be 8 lights in the air spaced out independent of each other similar to a playing card 8 of diamonds.  These moved independent of each other.  It appeared to be a search team of some sort.  I was just supprised to see this type of activity after a shooting star.  The Cleveland airport is about 20 miles east of the area we were in and a small county airport for small private planes about 4 miles away.  So I am familiar with normal air traffic in the area.  I have never seen anything like this in the past.<n>

It started higher in the sky and got closer to the horizon but went out of sight before it hit the horizon. We did not observe any sort of tail on it. At first we thought it might be an airplane but it moved to fast and it only had a single light on it. The light also traveled a pattern I don&#39;t think is consistant with airplane since it didn&#39;t describe an arc.<n>

The object appeared to be on an elliptical trajectory. The speed of the object was much greater than any known aircraft I have ever seen, but was slower than a meteorite. Continued viewing the object from east to west, as it appeared to be skipping across the atmosphere until it was out of view because of the tree line at about 20° above the northwest horizon. Viewing conditions were clear, no clouds or haze in the sky. My backgrounds is that of an amateur astronomer and have spent many nights viewing the sky.<n>

The light was orange or white (very fast) and was moving into the west.  It lasted perhaps 3 to 4 seconds and was larger than any star or planet in the sky.  It appeared to be moving in a downward direction (as if it were landing or crashing).  No sound was heard.  Later in the evening, my thirteen year old niece stated that she also saw the &#39;shooting star&#39;.  I thought nothing more of it until Artbell on 2/5/01.

As we approached I-80 heading South I noticed two small white objects flying in and out of a large thunderhead that had formed to the south east of the city.  I thought they were starnge and kept watching them. They would fly into the cloud, and then fly out.  At first I thought they were gulls.  I realized that they were way to big to be gulls, and had never seen a gull at that altitude (the objects were 1/2 way &#34;up&#34; vertically from the bottom to the top of the thunder cloud).  They were also moving very quickly (I can&#39;t guess how fast). I pointed them out to my daughters.  My 12 year old didn&#39;t have her glasses on so she didn&#39;t see them.  My 8 year old saw them clearly and expressed astonishment. We continued on Atlantic Street and then entered I-80 heading East.  I lst sight of them then. The whole incident lasted approximately 1 minute.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

I returned home and waited for them to come around the block. At approximately 6:55 p.m. I went to the kitchen window which faces the street in front of our home. The whole street was dark except for the Halloween lights and lite up pumpkins that people had turned on for the occasion.  But to my surprise, I witnessed more then just Halloween lights that night.  For there above my neighbors home, a crossed the street, were two large balls of white light blinking on and off, stationary in the sky.  When one would blink on the other would go off, and when the one that was on would go off, the other would come on.  They did this alternately for about 2 minutes and in perfect time!  One was a bit higher then the other, and after about 2 minutes of this, it lowered so it was parallel with the other.  Then they did a most ! unusual thing, they moved slowly together and became one ball of light.  Then they slowly moved away to the southeast, and as it moved it changed colors from red to blue and green.  At the time I had three pumpkins on my porch lite up and one of them was blinking on and off, and I can&#39;t help but wonder if that is the reason they chose to blink on and off like they did.<n>

I was standing outside and noticed something flying slowly and completely silentl from the Northwest to the Southeast and it looked like it was on fire. It was moving a little slower than the speed of an airplane kind of like that of a helicopter. It didn&#39;t look like a meteor, there was no tail behind it. My wife and two children came outside and witnessed it too.   Approximately one to two minutes later we saw another going in the same direction. They passed dierctly over my house and then turned slightly more to the south after passing by.<n>

It flew slowly from the north to the south, stopped, slowly pivoted 180*, and then took off very fast toward the north. It flew and hovered about 100 ft. in the air, and flew soundlessly. It measured approximately 100 ft. from corner to corner. I saw no flame or engine from the craft. The location was within 2 miles from the Jackson International Airport and a Air Force Base, but this did not look like an airplane or amy aircraft that I had ever seen. I have seen the B12 bomber up close and far away, and it was NOT that. The witnesses were myself, my husband, and our son. I was 42 at that time, and our son was 12 y/o. I have a B.S. degree in Nursing, and a M.A. degree in Marriage and Family Therapy. My husband, 45 y/o at the time, is an engineer with a B.S. degree who served 3 years in the Army, and he knows all the publically known aircraft. He is a military history buff who has studied military craft of all kinds. There were others that saw this craft as it occurred in a very public area near I-20 and a 6 lane highway.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

We figured it was a planet so they left. An hour later, it was still there in the same position in the sky when I noticed that it had a circular shape with white lights around the edges of it. Inside the center was a Y and a semi circular shape underneath the Y. I looked at it until it got dark outside and then left. At 5 a m I looked outside and saw that it was still  there in the same spot, so I hurriedly dressed and when I went outside, it was gone.<n>

The light was constant, not blinking or changing colors.  Then about two minutes later we spotted another one coming more from the northeast, but traveling in the exact same direction, like they were meeting at one point.  We followed them until we lost sight of them from the brightness of the moon.  This has happened on numerous occasions, and on each one they were traveling in different directions.  Twice they were north to south, then I also saw one moving from west to east alone on a different night.  The one I am writing about occured this past Monday.  The light seemed to be brighter than the others and was traveling from south to northwest.  About one minute later I spotted another moving from the west to northwest, going to the same point as the other.  This happened at 4:20am.  Then at 5:15am I spotted another coming from the direction the other 2 went, traveling northeast to southwest.  I have watched this go on for about 2 weeks now.  Each time I see them it is almost like clockwork.  The first couple of occasions this happened at 5:20am.  This last time it was 4:20am, two days after daylight savings time.  These lights are not aircraft because they are moving way too fast and are very high in the sky.  They blend in with the stars.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We do not know what the witness was observing, but the descriptions seems somewhat reminiscent of satellites.

I was reading late at night, my husband was in bed in the next room, and I heard the deepest, most powerful-sounding, diesel turbo type sound I&#39;d ever heard, sounding like it was coming across our yard, and getting louder.  The sound rattled the plates out of the plate grooves in the china hutch, and rattled the windows in our old farmhouse.  It was loud enough to hurt our ears.  Hubby was up instantly, and we both said, &#34;What on earth is that?&#34;  We looked out the south window upward, and saw a huge dark triangle shape with rounded corners hovering about 20 feet over our roof. It had red, green and white lights, not bright, just twinkling, and about clearance-light size.  Immediately, it whisked out of sight heading SW.  We steeled ourselves to hear a plane crash, but heard nothing more.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The next morning, I called the Federal Aviation Authority and asked if they had any idea what it was.  The man said sometimes Offutt (Air Force Base) conducts maneuvers late at night, but certainly not right atop someone&#39;s house.  He checked a chart, and then said no, we were much too far south of Offutt&#39;s maneuvering perimeter.  I could tell he wasn&#39;t too interested, and didn&#39;t want to pursue it more, so I thanked him and hung up.  When I got home from work, I asked our nearest neighbor if he had heard anything the night before, and he said, &#34;Yeah, did you guys start up your tractor late at night?  I wondered what you were doing, but went back to sleep.&#34;  Hubby and I agreed not to talk about it anymore, lest folks around home think we were weird and make jokes, like they did about the family who claimed their house was haunted.<n> <n><n> <n><n> But last week, we were visiting in a group of middle-aged to older farm folks, and found otherlocal farmers had seen or heard strange things too.  Two of them reported seeing very bright, chartreuse-green spotlights that appeared to come from a helicopter or something (although there was no sound) focused from above, onto their hog or cattle lots.  Then I spilled the beans about our encounter, and no one kidded us at all.  You have to understand, these folks are salt-of-the-earth, practical-minded farmers, who certainly aren&#39;t prone to telling tall tales, so we all believed each other.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;m ((deleted--50&#39;s)) years old, hold ((deleted)) jobs (family farms are in financial struggles these days,) one in business administration at a ((deleted)), NE company, and my moonlighting job in ((deleted)) at the ((philantrophic company)), as a professional ((deleted)) in their large ((deleted)) center.

At the time of our sighting (Approx. 21:30) were heading west on I-8 in Arizona about half-way between Dateland and Welton.  I have since found out the Goldwater AFB runs right along the freeway there.  I was driving.  I looked in my rear-view mirror and saw one very bright amber orb of light behind, to the SE of us.  I watched it for about a minute until it just blinked out.  We drove another couple of minutes and didn&#39;t think to much of it, it could have been anything.  A couple of minutes later, due South, I saw three amber orbs lined up vertically, perfectly equidistant from each other.  They were at about a 100 degree angle from our car (to my left and just a little bit behind the car).  I would guess they were only 1-200ft from the south side of the east-bound freeway.  The bottom light maybe 100ft from the ground, putting the top light maybe 400ft from the ground.  The lights faded on and off for about a minute.  They seemed to be following the same dirrection of our car and the exact same speed.  We were a little scared to think we might be being followed, for this reason we never did pull over.  When the lights were at their brightest the middle light split into two seperate lights now with a total of four lights in a diamond shape, roughly 300ft hight x 100ft wide.  At one point I rolled down my window to see if they were making any sound.  I could hear our car and the other few cars but no sound otherwise.  They were still pulsating and moving along the same path as the car.  They were not moving any further north towards us but going west with us.  It didn&#39;t actually appear as though they were moving but they weren&#39;t getting any further away and we were traveling about 75mph.  Another couple of minutes and the two outside lights each split into three seperate lights making a total of eight.  They maintained perfect formation and never broke their equidistance.  I couldn&#39;t see an actual structure holding them t! ogether but I couldn&#39;t make out the horizon behind them whereas I could on either side.  The light was completely self contained and shed no light on the surroundings.  Another couple of minutes and they seemed to stop following the same path and were either going a lot slower or stopped and we kept going.  The lights eventually dimmed out all together.  I kept looking up and saw a few more unusual flashes high up in the sky but the latter lights could very well have been some known aircraft, shooting stars, or a meteor shower.  I have educated myself on the appearance of flares.  These WERE NOT FLARES.  There was no smoke, the lights never once descended.  They were amber not white and did not flicker what-so-ever.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I was sitting on the couch watching TV when I noticed a bright white light through the shades of a west facing window. The light flashed several times and left a trail. My first thought was that someone was shooting fireworks in the neighborhood. Instead of disappearing, as would be expected, the light maintained it&#39;s position in the sky and began to strobe erraticly. I went out to the front porch and turned out the light for a better look. After a few seconds I once again saw the strange light. It was now farther away and higher in the sky framed between two trees. It began jumping very quickly from point to point in the sky. This was happening so quickly that at first I might actually be seeing 3 or 4 seperate objects. I ran into the house to call my daughter out. By the time I returned the object was higher in the sky and moving north at a moderate rate of speed. My daughter was too late to view the object. Approximately 1 minute after the the object moved north, another object appeared from the south moving in what appeared to me to be the same flight path of the original object. It had two equally bright lights (very bright- brighter than seen on most air craft). From the ground the lights appeared to glow steadily (no strobeing). By the time my daughter located my binoculars and brought them to me the second object was far to the north. As I looked with the binoculars the lights appeared to be colored red and green (odd because they looked white when seen from the ground)and were strobeing constantly at a very fast rate. This was definitely not a fireworks display! I&#39;ll be very surprised if I am the only person to report this event.<n>

Sky was mixture of clear and very high clouds. The light was very noticeable and began to move from southwest to southeast at a very slow pace. Appeared to be very high, perhaps 10,000ft. Slowly dropped down to about 2,000ft, remaining extremely bright intense white light, then dimming to a tiny pin point of light, then getting extremely bright again. I got into my car and drove to a friends&#39; house approximately 6 miles southeast of my location, hurried in to tell her to come out and see it. When we went out, there it was, with 5 other ones, that were drifting down and hovering over the tree lined hills to our immediate south. We watched them move down under the tree light and observed them disappear and appear quite some distance away to the southwest. No sound, except that of a commercial jetliner heading northeast over us. We went in because it was getting too cold and windy outside. When I was driving up to her place, my radio was picking up a lot of static which is unusual.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We cannot be certain what the witness observed, but we do observe that the report is not inconsistent with a &#34;twinkling&#34; star.  However, that is only a guess.  UFO&#39;s generally do not remain visible in one location for an hour, and there were no other reports from this part of the country.  PD))<n>

He called me and my husband to take a look at it. We watched it for awhile and it was a white/gold color. The lights seemed to pulsate. It was very low to the ground, so ran and got my telescope. We couldn&#39;t see anything other than a very bright shining light with different colors. As we watched it for a few minutes it disappeared.  We kept looking in the sky and a few minutes later it appeared in the north western sky a little higher than before. As we watched it it became brighter with changing colors than totally vanished. I don&#39;t know what we saw, but I know for sure it was not an airplane.  The object stood stationary for quite sometime and then just disappeared and than reappeared in  another part of the sky.  There were no markers,flasher of any kind, and no sound.  I would really like to have this one explained to me.<n>

I assumed it was a normal aerial craft (plane, helicopter) - but it seemed too bright and the lights weren&#39;t flashing in a regular rhythm.  I grabbed my 8mm video camera (analog) and recorded 90 seconds before it disapeared completely. Optical zooming revealed that indeed this was not Venus, another planet nor a star. The pattern and colors of the flashing lights were also not like any aircraft.  Several times before - and also once while filming - it faded out completely (not from a cloud), only to instantly reappear.  I digitally zoomed (24x) and then one could really see the strange pattern of lights ebbing and flowing throughout the disc of light now resolved by the lens.  I yelled for my friend to go tell the people in the house to come out to see this, but it disappeared again, and after a long wait, never returned. I think this is definitely a UFO.  I know many people have captured video footage of strange lights.  However, what makes this footage unusual (as far as I know), is that - when we played it back -  THERE IS A SOUND THAT SEEMS TO BE ASSOCIATED WITH THE LIGHT!  We did not hear anything when filming or observing it, and it seemed to be too far away (several miles?) to hear any sound, unless it was creating a loud sound like a normal aircraft. The sound is loud enough to easily hear after the light reappears; but after you have heard it and know what to listen for, you can hear it during the first part of the tape also.  It is not camera noise from the zoom or focus motors, and there was nothing in our environment that I can imagine could have caused it.  It repeats in a regular rhythm 6 or 8 times.  It is very similar to the sound you hear submarines make with sonar in the movies. I am going to digitize the tape and have the video - and especially the audio - digitally enhanced.  I&#39;m sure the audio signature can be compared with - for instance - a sonar sound to see if it matches it, or any other known source.<n>

It was triangular, with non-flashing red lights at each corner and two large white lights near the center of the underside.  The white lights pulsed on and off approximately every 5 seconds. When I tunded off the jacuzzi jets to listen to the craft, I realized that it was silent. My wife and I were rather amazed to see such a large craft (I&#39;d estimate roughly 75-100 feet long by 50-75 feet wide) which made no apparent sound. I would estimate the craft to be about 400-800 feet above us initially heading from northwest to southeast and the disappearing only to return from the east horizon and heading west, practically passing directly overhead.  It appeared to be travelling below the stall speed of most, if not all fixed wing aircraft (estimated speed at 35-45 mph) I last watched the craft about 5 miles away heading west over the city of La Crescenta, CA. As the craft passed over us, we heard a very soft rumbling or roaring sound.<n>

( Jupiter and Saturn being in the east and where my telescope was aimed ) I watched as the object darted across the sky and passed through Cassiopeia ( almost directly above my position ). It than moved towards Jupiter and Saturn. Jupiter was to the lower left of Saturn. The object continued on its coarse passing just below Saturn from my perspective. The object apeared to not be in earths atmosphere. There was no discernable shape to the object and all I was able to observe was a brite white lite. The object was not a meteorite or any type of debrese because for one there was no tail and secondly it did not apear to move like previously observied meteorites.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Anonymous source; only e-address provided by witness.

The time was 9:30 PM in Laurel Md.  There is a lot of air traffic here, so you get used to lights in the sky.  But this was different.  Dull red/white light, so hard to see you almost have to look to the right or left of it to see the light.  Sometimes brighter, then duller.  It took a good 5 minutes to go halfway across the sky, really slow for any plane or satellite.  I actually went back inside the house for 30 seconds, came back out and it was still slowly going from east to west.  This is where it gets really scary. Hear this.  A jet from BWI is heading in the same direction as this object. I thought to myself, could be a collision. Same direction, mind you.  As the jet gets within about 1/2 mile overtaking the object, it suddenly gets slightly brighter, then\ blinks out.  Just like that.  As if someone turned the light out.  I kept watching. the jet went directly past where the light would have been.  I stayed outside for a good 15 more minutes to see if I could see the light. Nothing.  Did anyone else see this?  Did BWI know about this??  What is going on in this area??????<n>

Works with learning disabled population.  Observer has a learning disability and has been in counseling regarding this issue.  Given these facts, he is a careful observer, and takes care not to overreact to any situation.  Observer saw 3 lights in the sky.... brighter than all others, which seemed to outline a triangular shape... black in color... which seemed to be rotating along a verticle axis.  Object outline about 100 yards wide.  No noise detected.  Observer looked around at the rest of the sky and noticed no stars whatsoever on this night... and wondered as to why just these 3 lights were visible.  Observer noticed &#34; beam of light &#34; that seemed to go back and forth among the 3 lights, which changed coler from red, to brown, to blue.  Observer out of curiosity decided to flash car headlights in a sequence in the direction of these lights.  Object seemed to flash its lights and disappeared.  It later reappeared.  Observer is careful not to jump to conclusions and wonders if there were any other reports in the area.<n>

The bubble-shaped objects were slightly transparent, with a small blue light at the center of each one. I told my brother to stop the car and I got out and when I looked up, the object stopped and hovered directly over the car for a minute and then it started to gain speed and moved away and disappeared.

I was so excited i sped up and went to my friend place and we ( 4 of us including some village folk) saw it. 3 of the bright objects formed a triangle and the other 2 formed a squair with the base of the triangle. they were moving upweards with a great speed and went upweards, and appeared to be going away from earth.

I carve and paint birds from wood and do most of my finishing outside as was the case on a beautiful afternoon in October of 2000. On this particular day there were a multitude of jet planes coming from the northeast flying at a very high altitude over head and on to the south or southwest. I could barely make out their shapes,(of course the contrails were very visible)and since a friend had given me a new pair of binoculars I became curious and went in the house to get them. I watched the jets for a while until my neck started to strain from looking straight up and so I was about to continue with my work when I looked over towards the northheast horizon and noticed a dark dot in the blue sky. I walked toward it about 20 feet and put the binoculars on the object and watched it come toward me. It started to veer to my left and I had a perfect side view as it crossed the western sky. It looked grayish silver and was oblong in shape about the size of a small jet plane to the naked eye. It made no discernable noise and had no wings or tail but when I put the binoculars on it as it crossed before me I could see that it had a protrusion above and also below that made it look like a symmetrical top. I watched it until I could see it no more. Later that day I drew a picture of what I had seen and took it to my neighbor who was a military pilot and now flys for a commercial airline.He looked at it but could not identify with it at all.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

After I noticed the sphere, I ran to the window and got a very good view of it.  After a second or two it stopped, reversed direction, then reversed again about a second later, continuing on it&#39;s original path.  It shot away at an estimated 20 mph.  At that point I ran downstairs and outside to see if I could follow it.  By that time it was too far away.<n>

10/27/00 11:45|Sunderland (UK/England)||||This report was made in my local newspaper 'The Sunderland Echo' on 27th October 2000 WEAR UFO IS SPOTTED WITHIN FEET OF A JET INVESTIG|12/2/00|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/014/S14783.html|69|ndxe200010| This report was made in my local newspaper &#39;The Sunderland Echo&#39; on 27th October 2000 WEAR UFO IS SPOTTED WITHIN FEET OF A JET INVESTIGATORS remain baffled after more sightings emerged today of an unidentified flying object over Wearside. The five-foot pear-shaped piece of silver metal was first spotted hurtling towards the ground by trainee teacher Jenny Cook in Hendon on Tuesday morning. Police launched an inquiry following the report by the 18-year-old Sunderland University student but, despite a ground search of the area, failed to find any trace of the object. The Echo has now learnt that officials at Newcastle Airport were alerted after a similar sighting three hours later above Penshaw. Ron Atwill spotted a mysterious five-foot long grey object narrowly miss a passenger jet as it made its descent towards Newcastle Airport, while walking his dog near the old Herrington Colliery site. Mr Atwill, a retired prison service worker, saw the object at 11.45am. He said: &#34;I was looking up as a passenger jet was flying quite low in the distance on a flight path between the colliery and Penshaw Monument and I saw this thing almost hit it. I rang the airport because this thing appeared that close and I thought they might have spotted it as well. It was about 20ft away from the plane. &#34;It looked exactly the way it was described in the Echo. It was a silvery grey in colour and from where I was standing it looked very flat, pear shaped and about four to five feet long. &#34;I watched it for a little while and then turned away and took my eye off it and it had disappeared. It almost looked like it was standing still, moving very slowly earthbound towards Sunderland. If you can imagine a piece of corrugated iron, but not corrugated and oblong.&#34; Speculation has included suggestions that the metal could be debris from a plane or a metal chunk from a decaying Pegasus satellite, which Nasa officials have warned is in the process of breaking up and falling to earth. Other theories include that the object could have been a model aircraft, advertising balloon, or even plastic sheeting. Mr Atwill, 64, of Elm Place, Newbottle, added: &#34;I hadn&#39;t a clue what it was and I didn&#39;t want to say anything, because of what people might think. &#34;But I definitely saw something. It wasn&#39;t a speck in the sky. It was big enough to make out even though it was a bit in the distance, but now I am beginning to think what was it? I thought it must have been something dropping out of the sky. I wasn&#39;t imagining it. I should know, I was there. It wasn&#39;t a weather balloon or a model.&#34; A spokeswoman for Newcastle Airport said the pilot on board the jet had reported no sightings to air traffic controllers. Detective Inspector John Watts, of Sunderland City Centre Police, said: &#34;We had a report of a strange object in the skies about the size of a small car. We couldn&#39;t find anything but it has been reported to the relevant authorities.&#34; Roger Mallett, an independent paranormal investigator, said: &#34;It is more than likely they saw something which they can&#39;t rationally explain and they don&#39;t know who to turn to. The fact that two independent people did, adds more credibility and if more come forward, even in two or three weeks&#39; time, will certainly add even more weight.&#34; North East Press Ltd<n>

It seemed to be drifting from south to north at an even elevation of about 400-500 feet (?), and moving more quickly than the shore breeze. After about 20 seconds it started rising from its flat path at about 60 degrees from the horizon and disappeared from my sight.  This all on a bright sunny day with clear visibility. If indeed it was a balloon, it was very large. I have seen adrift balloons let loose from the shoreline here before, and this was indeed out over the sound at some distance, and too large to be a typical balloon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with this witness, and he sounded to be both sincere, and quite serious-minded.

Why is it 7:45 am , when I just looked at the clock and it was 1:15 am a second ago?<n> <n><n> <n><n> My husband and I were lying in bed and we heard our vertical blinds in the kitchen make a noise like someone had just pushed them aside. I said :&#34; What was that ?&#34; and my husbamd ((name deleted)) said &#34; I don&#39;t know&#34;. I then he heard a strange tone, 2 of them high then low, and then saw a red light shine in the hallway. THen a  white light appeared.   I started to say  &#34; What is that &#34; only the &#34; &#34;what is&#34; was said in the bedroom at 1:15 and the &#34; that &#34; word was said in the kitchen at 7:45am. I said &#34; oh my god , Why are we in the kitchen now and why am I finishing my sentence in here. We felt as though we were dropped into the kitchen and in a big  hurry.  We were rushing around trying to fix breakfast and don&#39;t know why...   We don&#39;t eat breakfast right when we get up. Where did all the time go ? Where were we ? What was that tone and lights about ?  Did we go somewhere and don&#39;t remember ? Our three year old son said later that day that &#34; The mean men were coming back when its dark outside again.&#34; I asked him if the men drove here and he said no they come from up there and pointed to the sky.,...........WHen he was 2 years old he would wake up almost every night at the same time and talk to someone in his room It ws like he having a conversation. We would laugh and then once screamed bloody murder like something was hurting him. We went in his room and he clung to us for the rest of the night and said he was sacared of them. WHo ? He said those guys. When he was 1 week old we went in his room to feed him and he was in a totally different position than when we left him. THis happened about 5 or 6 times. He also developed a red triangular shaped mark on the back of his leg and it stayed there for 1 to 2 months before going away. We never did figure out what it was. It was about 1 Inch in size and he was about 8 months old. My twenty year old daughter who lives in LA and is going to college would insist that she had another mommy and daddy that lived way over there and would point to the sky when she was 2 - 5 years of age. She even had names for them and could not have made them up because they were very odd and very hard to pronounce. We lived in Yakima , Wa at the time out side of town on 5 acres. I have had quite of few weird things happen in the last three years, like firecrackers going off in my bedroom and lights turning them selves off and on. I pick up strange conversations on the phone quite often too. One day I was sitting on the floor in my bedroom and heard a elecrtical zapping noise coming from behind me. I turned around to see my plant zapping electricity from one upper branch to a lower one. It burned it off the main stalk and left soot. It looked at though it had been burned off. The branch fell to the ground and was smoldering. I hope to hear from you soon and maybe you can make some sence of this. Its so weird...We have never seen an alien or been on a ship but feel as though I have and don&#39;t know why. Where did the 7 hours go? Was our son left here by himself ? THanks for listening.......... ((names and contact data deleted))<n> <n><n> When I was 15 I was walking home with my girlfriend at 9:30 pm in Ellensburg, WA and I saw something moving in the sky, with my perphial vision. I looked up and saw nothing. Once again about 1 minute later I saw something moving and turned my head I looked up and saw nothing. I kept walking and once again saw something moving out of the corner of my eye. THis time I kept my vision on the object and slowy turned my head and saw an enormous aircraft carrier in the sky. It was covered in lights that looked just like the stars.   I told ((name deleted)) what I saw and told her to look out of the corner of her eye and she would see something moving very slowly. On her forth attempt she zeroed in on it. She grabbed my hand and screamed &#34; oh my GOd&#34;&#39; . We started rumming for home and then decided to stop and watch it under a tree. We sat down shaking very hard from being so scared and watched it for about 1/2 hour. It circled the valley of Eburg 3 times very slowy and them disappeared as it turned to go back up higher in the sky. It looked just like the sky so you could not see it if you were just looking up. THe lights on it would change with the stars as it passed them so it didn&#39;t attract attention to a star being covered up. The reason you couldn&#39;t see it if you were just looking at the sky was because of this. It was so big , like 2000 747&#39;s hooked together . I don&#39;t know how high up it actually was but I would say 60,000 to 100,000 feet up. I have had so many weird things happen that I can&#39;t begin to tell you all of them. ..

It looked like it was traveling south west and turned west toward mountains. It emerged from the west roof line of the house and SLOWLY turned and moved in a West direction disappearing behind my tree in the back yard.I think that I saw the bottom of the craft. I turned off the air jets on the hot tub and could not hear any propulsion system as ambient noise.It was short duration and I had to sit in the tub to think about what I had seen. I had NOT been drinking any alcohol or ingested any drugs of any type.I am still skeptical about what I saw, however, I am not going to deny what I think that I saw.I am mailing a diagram of where I was and what I saw.<n>

I was out on the deck of my house about 10:00PM looking with binoculars looking out at the city and stars. A huge triangular object at least two football fields in size suddenly appeared from the south above my house.  It was coming from the south direction near NORAD in Colo. Spgs.  It was Triangular in shape, and definitely had cloaking or stealth capability.  It was travelling at a slow rate of speed over my house, and following the I225 corridore parallel to Buckley AFB.  The whole interior of the craft was lighted when decloaked and I could see inside the craft as it passed me.  It had huge rectangular wing spars which may have been power sources or generators.  The control center at the front of the craft was all lighted.  As it was parallel to Buckley AFB (classified-Radar Domes)it started to cloak or go into a stealth mode and as it proceeded North and disappeared.  The amazing part, is Denver International Airport to the north uses this area as a holding pattern for commercial jets landing but, it did not seam to interfere with the Triangular UFO as it slowly moved along the interstate.  I am now retired, and worked for many years as a missile launch technician for the Defense Dept., and as a Quality Manager for McDonnell Douglas building pilot training programs and software, Telecommunications etc.  I am now a firm believer in UFO&#39;s, and no debunking by the government or military will ever change my mind.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

FR475 is 26 miles north of Morenci AZ.  It was a beautiful clear night. The visibility was perfect.  My brother said to me that he was watching a UFO show in the sky and I should take a look. We were camping at 5000 ft and looking in a south easterly direction. We saw three lights that went from the size of a star to large round glowing spheres.  They moved in different directions on the horizon. We were looking just above the mountain tops. You could see them go up, down, sidewaze and increase in brightness. They were not a falling star or satellite.   They continued to move in motion that was not normal for a craft.  Then one of the spheres suddenly increased in it glow and climaxed with something shooting out of it in a bright white light show leaving trails.  Then 2 disappeared. One continued to follow the lights of a aircraft in the vacinity at the time. The sphere went in front of the lights, under and behind. Then disappeared.   We could not tell if this was happening in outer space or above White Sands Air Force Base.  It lasted 10 minutes or so.<n>

About 3 miles outside of Saint Joseph city limits, above the trees there was a 3 dimensional reflective rectangle in the air, not moving, approximately 5 miles away. The reason we were able to see the object is that the sun was setting in the west, and the object was in the north.  Thus, the sun was reflecting off the object. A few seconds later, the object turned clockwise, and was very difficult to see, because of the loss of reflection.  A few seconds later the object disappeared. I am a pilot, and the object I saw was not a commercial aircraft.  The object was too large an not moving.<n>

I was staying on Panama City Beach (Baltimore Beach facing west) very near to St.Andrews (Shell Island) Park enterence. Being a former member of my local MUFON I was keeping a eye open during my stay in PCB, but didn&#39;t see anything of interest except for some very strange Military activity. The Beach was buzzed by F-18s each day during my stay at odd hours. This day though while on the beach with two other friends, I was watch- ing strange boat activity on the horizen. Just as one F-18 buzzed the beach with a over head flight, I was observing one of the military craft on the horizen (to the South-West). I wittnessed something launch ed from the boat that skimmed the water heading directly south from the craft with a flight duration of 45 seconds to one minute before splash down and then the F-18 left the beach as if its engine was used to mask the sound of the launch. I was using 10 by 25 fully coated opitics to watch the sight. At first I dismissed the sighting as military training being that there are several bases in the area, and you have to train somewhere after all. But with the f-18s buzzing the beach every day and the recent mass beaching of deep sea sharks on the eastern shore of Shell Island (Oct 18-22,2000). I felt that this sighting should be reported to some one.<n>

Last night it was different, It shocked me, I dindn&#39;t know what to do, to scream out of happiness and fear,to run an wake up mu son so I can have a witness or to get my camera. Finally between watching what seemed to have massive light and a tail object changing shape to a full circle then half a circle, I steamed downstairs to my office and grapped the camera and put it on nightshot, by then the half circle began to disapear, but I cought a glimpse of it which you could freeze and see on my film. Please have someone contact me and I will supply you with the film. ((name deleted))<n>

On the surface:  we saw three lights. AH...but wait..... first we see a small light in the sky.  Thought it was odd because it was not blinking (maybe not a plane) and very low on the horizon (maybe not a satellite).  Then we see it go behind a dark spot in the sky (cloud, about 20 miles away and about 2500 feet above our ground level of 6000 feet.)  The light turns, goes into the dark spot (Cloud?) and what comes out on the other end are three MEGA Size lights (one at a time like blinking on 1 then on 2 then  on 3).  How big?  The lights were no less than twice the size of my trailer and sharp brilliant, like the light you would see if you were looking at Jupiter.  They float out from behind the cloud, blink on one at a time then in about 3 or 4 seconds blink out: POOF all gone! If you held your hand up to the sky the lights would be bigger than the finger nail on your thumb! We live in an extremely isolated area of the gila national forest. Last night around 7:30 pm we started to hear some jets fly over.  This is very unusual around here especially at night.  I went to take a look and it was obvious they were military craft.  They spent about 2 hours going around and around over the mountains here.  There were at least 4 jets, but I could not tell what kind other than not being commerical.  It appeared as if they were looking for something. ((name deleted))   ((e-address deleted))<n>

A few seconds later, we saw several faint stobes coming from a single point in the sky. At first we thought it might have been klieg lights, but it became obvious that these beams of light were not originating from the ground. They all came from within a single point up in the sky.  While staring up, we also saw three contrails (not sure they were actually contrails, but that is what they looked like) that formed a PERFECT triangular shape - even stranger, the contrails appeared to be sparkling as though they were electrically charged.  There were light clouds in the sky that formed an almost perfect circle around the perimeter of the sparkling triangle, and they were distorted as though heat waves were emanating through them. The size of this circle was about 3 or 4 city blocks. At this point, I became very frightened and ran downstairs to call the UFO hotline. I went back upstairs about 20 minutes later and the sparkling contrails were still there and still shaped like a perfect triangle, but the clouds were gone. We took a picture with a digital camera, but sadly, nothing showed up in the photo.  After about 10 minutes, the whole thing disappeared.  We were perfectly sober when we made this observation.  We are still trying to speculate what we may have seen - military camouflage technology? weather techology? I would be interested in knowing if others saw it.<n>

The object drifted from the north west in a south easterly direction until it was approximately over the middle of the body of water known as Liberty Bay here in Poulsbo. Its altitude was approximately 18,000&#39;. When it reached the above point, the object changed direction to a south westerly heading and appeared to rise into the atmosphere until it disappeared behind the thin cloud cover. The objects speed was very slow as if it were being blown by upper level wind currents. However, as it changed course, it maintained a straight line thus discounting the possibility of its being influenced by those upper level winds. My background is one of approximately 20 years in general aviation with my current occupation being one of sales. I am in my late fifties. My wife, formerly a skeptic, also witnessed this phenomenon. She is in her late forties and a school teacher by trade. I contacted the local air route traffic control center and they in turn contacted Sea-Tac tower.

I looked up and seen a orange colored ball moving fairly fast across the sky(right to left).  I asked him if it was an airplane and he said there is no way that that is an airplane.  While watching this ball of light it then split into two, it actually looked like it dripped like mercury into 2 equal size balls. The one ball kept on moving to our left while the other one that broke off went in the opposite direction.  After a few minutes the one on the left dissapeared and the second one shortly dissapeared after the first one.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Facing south I surveyed the sky looking up &amp; around at various areas of the sky. Bringing my head back around to the S. facing direction, I was surprised to see a darker space ahead of me about 200 ft. high &amp; less than 3 miles away. I determined it was a solid object by the fact it was blocking out the few stars I had seen in that direction. It appeared to be a triangle shape that was wider that the height of it&#39;s apex. There were no lights - the sharpest edges were hard to focus on, they seemed to have a black smoke swirling around them. After just a few minutes it  moved away farther to S. in instantly shifting positions.<n>

On Tuesday night however I witnessed something that I CAN NOT explain. Just as one of the local aircraft began passing my field of view on my right, a very bright flash occured in front of me, around 60 degrees up from the horizon in the north / northeast. It just appeared. It was an extremely bright oval shaped object, with a dim circle in the middle. It was brighter by far then anything else in the sky. It then began to either move almost stright up, or deminish in intensity to a pin point then disappear. this all took place within the count of 1.. 2.. 3.. 4.., and it was gone. I have waited hoping that I would read, or hear in the Media about a super Nova. I have heard nothing. I have stood on my back deck for the last several night hoping I would see a plane, or something that would explain this observation. Everything has repeated itself routinely except for the above event. One other observation, the placement of the object,[exact distance, and altitude unknown] would have placed it very close, if not over the Peach Bottom Nuclear Plant on the Susquehanna River in Pennsylvania.<n>

I turned down the road to see what it was. I saw a very bright light through the trees and as I got closer it made a loud humming sound so that I could hardly hear my cd player. I looked down at my cd player and the trak timer was going so fast that I couldn&#39;t make out the numbers. I drove a bit further and in a field behind the trees I saw this gigantic craft the shape of 2 pyramids stuck together at the bottoms. At every corner there were bright lights so light it was almost like daylight. I rushed home to tell my mom and she said it took me about an hour to get home when it mormally takes 20 minutes and according to the clock in my car it only took me 20 minutes.<n>

It was about 6:40 - 6:45 am. I was on highway 167(in Kent, Wa.)  heading north. As far as &#34;How far away did it seem&#34;? I would have to say anywhere from downtown Seattle to as far as possibly Bellingham. The description I would give this object I saw was as follows: It lasted for approx. 2 - 3 seconds. The trail behind it was blue to blue-green in color. The width of the trail I would say from that distance was as wide as your thumb. (not your normal meteor streaking accross the sky)<n>

She observed this object for approx. 30 sec. then came to the door to our deck to get me to come outside to see what was there. In the sky was a large triangle shape with lights at the apex of each point. It was flying at a very slow rate.  Too slow it seemed to be staying aloft.  There was a red bubble of light in the very center of the bottom, appox. 5 times the size of the other lights. When the object arrived overhead a bright yellow light started to blink at a slow rate on the side closest to us. The hills that line our valley are at the 500 foot level, we know this as we have measured them for grape vinyards. The object was at approx. 1000 ft. covered appox. 25 % of the avail. sky, no sound, no engine noise, no obvious exaust ports, no tail sections present when going away, after 2 min. blinked out.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with this witness at length, and found his description of the sighting most convincing.

We were up on the top floor &amp; we saw it through our sliding glass window which looks out to the West.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Our initial reaction was disbelief at what we both had just witnessed.  My first inclination was that it had to be a meteor.  It was the brightness &amp; green color of fireworks but the size, speed, closeness, &amp; lateral movement across the sky made it apparent that it was not that.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We both jumped up &amp; went onto the porch to see if we could determine what it was.  It was very quiet outside &amp; I was surprised at how clear the sky was- especially for Seattle this time of year.  We turned on the news to see if anyone else had witnessed this- that&#39;s when we decided to check this websight &amp; report what we saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The interesting thing is that 3 days ago (on 10/18) someone had reported seeing the same thing in this area.  The object was travelling in the NW direction &amp; they noticed aircraft going in that same direction.  We noticed aircraft in the area, but this is nothing unusual due to the fact that we&#39;re only 20 miles from SeaTac airport.  This object appeared to have a tail like a comet, although it could have been caused by the speed that it travelled across the sky.<n>

At first I thought it was maybe a signal flare or something, but quickly ruled that out because there was no smoke or fluctuation of intensity and it wasn&#39;t falling at all.  I then thought maybe a new radio or communication tower had been built, but then realized the light was too high and too bright.  It also wasn&#39;t flashing like the strobes on many towers, although the light had the brightness and intensity a strobe.  The two things that made me realize this was something extraordinary were its intense brightness and its utter motionlessness.  The light appeared to pulsate slightly, but that could have been the result of atmospheric conditions.  The air was somewhat humid, though not really hazy. I watched the object for 3 to 4 minutes until it dimmed substantially and suddenly began to move off toward the east.  I don&#39;t know if the light went dim because it turned or if it in fact dimmed.  In any event, it became much more difficult to see as it began to move.  It didn&#39;t speed away but rather moved off at a fairly steady, smooth pace until it was no longer visible.   It was much smaller appearing after it began to move, probably because it became a dark object rather than a light one.  On the move, it appeared to be a sort of pea-shaped object, maybe slightly oblong, but mostly roundish. There was no noise associated with it at all. I,m 54 years old and don&#39;t drink or use drugs. I&#39;m a Vietnam vet and a practicing attorney.  I have never seen a UFO before.<n>

(Kamiah is north central Idaho)  She was on highway 12 at milepost 70.  The lights were described as 9 lights in a row and appeared to be three to a section, with one bright white light on each end, with a smaller red light in each center.  The area is mountainous and the object appeared to be approximately 1/4 mile away, and 300 feet in length, and was traveling in a downward direction.  It is possible that the &#39;string of lights&#39; landed in a clearing on the hillside.  No sound was heard.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At approximately 19:30 hours two boys 16 and 17 were at the Kamaih High School football field and noticed the same string of  lights travel slowly over the field at approximately 300 feet altitude traveling from east to west.

She saw 9 lights, but observed  3 distinct V shaped craft at an altitude of 3 to 400 feet.  All three craft were travelling from east to west.

I had read an article once on how you can communicate with it telepathically.  In my mind I said appear again and it did.  Then I asked if it was alone, then alot of the silver balls appeared but disappeared in the matter of seconds.  I saw it from Jersey City, but it was over the Manhattan skyline.  I asked it to appear again and nothing happened.  I asked several of my friends if they had seen any weird actvity in the sky at about that time.  They all said no.

While standing there I looked over the terminal building, and at the 11o&#39;clock position of the sky  I saw a shiny Silver cylindrical object . The object remained in the same position for about 4 - 6 minutes. I thought I was viewing a plane head on, but there were no wings visible and no motion `or movement. I could not tell if it was spinning or just shinning in the bright sun. I got on the bus and could still see it in the same position. I have always thought about this incident as I go through this airport every week at the same time. I read another report on this site describing the same type of event and decided to report this. The incident I am reporting actually happened on Oct 23,2000 at 11:00am<n>

It was at 6:50 AM on Monday, October 23, 2000. Walking down to the bus stop, I noticed a solid, bright light in the east sky. The day before, I read a report stating that most people mistake UFO&#39;s for Venus because they do not expect the planet to be so bright. I ruled out that the light was probably Venus. I saw a second light, lower than Venus and to the right. Dimmer, and smaller, but bright nonetheless, and solid. 	I looked at the sky with concentration. Blue, not a cloud in sight for miles, everything perfectly clear. I looked at the moon which appeared to be in the south. It was a crescent moon, and looked light a crooked smile. 	This is when I saw the light. A bright, flickering object in the sky off in the distance. It was on the left side, lower than Venus, to create an equilateral triangle. I stopped and stared at the &#34;UFO&#34;;, it clearly wasn&#39;t a planet, or an airplane. In fact as I looked at the object, I figured that it was blinking about 4 times a second. The entire object wasn&#39;t blinking. It had other lights, and only a portion of lights, on the bottom half of it, were blinking. I wasn&#39;t walking anymore, and noticed that it was moving back and forth slowly and unsteadily. 	Then came an airplane. In a relative distance to the UFO. Dark, with those slow blinking lights that anyone can spot and identify. A bird flew by, plainly. A bird nor an airplane, nor a planet can be this strange object I saw in the sky today, that formed a triangle with 2 (what I believe were) planets. 	I am very skeptical about this strange light being anything other than a light, or an object in the sky. But that strange, rapidly blinking light is unexplainable. I have seen strange lights in the sky before, but this is the first time I believe it couldn&#39;t be anything else, not a flare, a plane, a planet, the moon, a balloon, or spotlight. It was some sort of craft. This is a real mystery.<n>

I was having a latenight party at my house.  We were in the middle of watching a movie, and we had the speakers cranked up high, when I began to hear a loud whumping noise, like the noise of a helicoptor.  Startled, I jumped up and asked my brother to turn off the television.  Startled himself at my anxious expression, he did.  I heard clearly then, as well as the nineteen others piled in my living room, the noise outside.  We scrambled out as fast as we could to see a small triangular craft above my house (small in comparison to large ones I&#39;ve read about).  The craft was about the size of my house and in the shape of a triangular pyramid, but at that moment I could only see the bottom of it.  I yelled at my brother to go get a camera (I had to yell because the noise soon became very loud) when the noise of the craft was accompanied by many more.  We saw out of the sky a whole fleet of these craft come down by my house.  There were probably twenty to twenty five ships in all.  They stayed for a moment, got into some formation, and began to retreat back to the stars.  I remember the noise that they made was deafening.  There were no lights on the crafts until they got in formation.  Then  thin beams, like lasers, connected all the ships.  They traveled off smoothly.  We were so stunned we didn&#39;t tell anybody for weeks (who would believe us anyway?).  I live in a rural area and what few neighbors I did have were either out of town and didn&#39;t see the ships or they were at my party.  My parents were on a week-long getaway and they couldn&#39;t testify either.  Much of the group that were there won&#39;t talk about it now or just plain deny that it happened.

It  was  slower  and  brighter  than  a left-wing  red  airplane  light.  I  pulled  over  and  got  the  binoculars  out  to  see  a  grouping  of five  red  ovals  looking  exactly  like  your  photo  from  Gilbert  Arizona (which  prompted  me  to  make  this  report).  Then, as  I  watched,  3  or  four  small  white  lights  dropped  out  of  the  bottom  of  the  thing  to  speed  off  laterally  and  disappear. Within  seconds,  it  then  faded  to  two  dim  white  ovals  and  then  blinked  out.  About  30  seconds  later  I  saw  one  of  the  white  lights  drop  vertically  to  the  horizon  at  meteoric  speed  at  what  appeared  to  be  at  least  five  miles  from  the  red  lights  from  which  it  may  have  come.

They were moving very slowly in a due south direction.  The formation was in the shape of a cross with one triangular craft in the front, then three black triangular crafts.  The line of three black triangular crafts was perpendicular to an invisible line from the center of the first triangular craft to the center of the trailing black triangular craft.  That particular craft was trailing a little distance in the rear of the main formation.<n> <n><n> <n><n> All of them had very small red lights on all three tips of their triangular shapes.  The center craft in the formation had a bright white strobing light directly in the center  on the bottom.  The shapes were each about the size of a dime held at arms length.  There was absolutely no discernable sound from the formation before they were overhead, during the flyover, and after they&#39;d passed.  They were totally silent, almost as if they were five black phantoms (ghosts).<n> <n><n> <n><n> So far, NOBODY has given me an explanation of what they are, or were.  They DEFINITELY weren&#39;t B-2 bombers or F-117 aircraft.  I&#39;m very familiar with those military planes and the shape of their wings.  I&#39;ve heard of black triangular flying objects before, but never any details about them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I don&#39;t carry a camera around with me and had never seen unexplained flying objects before, so I went home and created a .gif of the formation and shapes of the craft I saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Being a trained illustrator for 25 years, having a BFA in art, and a USAF veteran who spent many nights on guard at USAF bases, I am a trained observer.  Like I said, I&#39;d never seen UFOs before and don&#39;t anticipate ever seeing anything like that again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> BTW, I called my youngest son (30 yrs old) outside to look at the sight and he saw them, too.  His comment was, &#34;WEIRD&#34;, quickly followed by, &#34;don&#39;t you ever tell anyone my name and that I witnessed it.  I don&#39;t need a bunch of  people crawling all over my yard and microphones stuck up to my face.&#34;<n> <n><n> <n><n> I guess that makes me the only reliable witness in my family.<n>

Object faded out of sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Observed what appeared to be a small cage-like object with several small blue lights all over it in the shape of a crushed cube, but only the size of a basketball.  It appeared to be wavering, almost as if it were dangling from a short string yet no string or wire was seen or found. It traveled from west to east at approximately 5 mph.  This was in a residential area with overhead street lights operating.  Observed through the front windshield of automobile.  It flew approximately 20-30 feet in front of automobile and was in a gradual descent over the road.  The object simply faded out of sight right in front of us.  Not behind trees or bushes, just faded out and was gone.  We both immediately exited the car and searched the area where it was descending to. Used the car headlights to illuminate the area.  Found nothing. No one else was around.  We immediately came back with flashlights and searched again.  Found nothing.  Went back the next day and checked the entire area during daylight and found nothing.  What makes this so odd was the apparent size of the object and the fact that we both had a clear, unobstructed view of it right in front of our car, 20-30 feet away. That was very close so it was easy to estimate the size of the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD))<n>

The object seems to have between 30 and 40 meters (or more) diameter, and was following our airplane (Piper Cheyenne III) in such a way that we did not see it during the flight. It camouflaged itself pretty well it seems.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Maybe &#34;they&#34; wanted us to record them in our pictures, a great mystery.  You are invited to come to our office in Lima to see the video and a 1280x1024 digital photo where the craft appears.  Or you can make us an offer to have us email the proofs to you.  The object left a trail that could be caused by extreme humidity in that hour of day when it was raining (seen only in the video).<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We will request copies of the photos.

Then there was a quick streak of the same bright white color just east of the two objects.  As if the two objects sped away to the east.It was a very short streak that just stopped with no trace. This all happened in about 2 seconds. The objects did not hover or hesitate. &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;   &lt;  &lt; Arrows depict scene.

They each had a reddish-orange light, but not like other aircraft flying in the area with flashing and running lights. They covered the area from horizon to horizon very quickly and then suddenly changed formation so as to be traveling in line one after the other and then abruptly took off in four different directions at an extreme rate of speed. We could not see much as far as a description of the aircraft, however their manuevering was unlike anything we are used to seeing in this area which is heavily travelled by commercial aircraft. They also seemed to be at a very high altitude, much higher than other aircraft in the area. And the aircraft seemed to be very large.<n>

At arm&#39;s lenth, it was approximately the size of a nickle or just a little larger. The object had no lights but appeared to be reflecting the burnt orange light from the sodium vapor lamps. From the brief sighting it seemed that it was not a solid craft like a plane, but rather a frame because the light reflected off of points that closely resembled a cross pattern, like a jet, but no sold body. I would guess that it traveled at the same altitude a cessna would but it moved much, much faster.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date of sighting is approximate.  PD))<n>

The object was very low in the sky (about 1500 feet) and flying on a flat trajectory. It was flying on an almost due east to west coarse and was seen at a distance of about 1/8 of a mile.  The object was seen for about 7 seconds and I had a very good side view for a couple of seconds even though the object was moving very rapidly. A second or two after the object passed from my side view, the light of the object turned off. The object made no sound.<n>

It was light out.  The object were like a dark grey color.  They were in a &#34;V&#34; formation almost like a flock of geese.  The leading object dipped then flew up and went between the other 4 then disapeared.  The remaining 4 object went into several different formations.  At one point two of them seperated from the other two.  They remained like that for about 3 minutes.   We judged the distance to be about 15 feet between the pairs. Then they just disapeared.   WE TOOK A PICTURE.  We had a digital camera with us and my husband was able to capture one fairly good picture.  At the time he took the picture you can see three of them.

It was traveling from west to east being followed by a jet aircraft leaving a significant trail behind as the jet followed the object in the same direction of west to east travel. The object ahead of the jet seemed to stop midair before it became highly luminous; casting a bright shiny, silvery glow just 5 seconds prior to disappearing in plain sight of the observers.Jets continued to fly around the area for the better part of the afternoon continuing to leave significant trails as they did.The shape of the object was only evident for a brief second before it began to glow a bright silvery color and diaappear in midair.One of the observers said it was like a pencil shape before beginning to shine brightly. The other observer thought it looked as though it was long in the middle and more dome shaped on top.The consensus of both observers is that it was not leaving a trail, did not appear to be a jet or any kind of known aircraft, and was hovering in one spot for at least 5 seconds , began to glow a silvery color and then &#34;poof&#34; disappeared from sight. One of the observers is a six-year Navy veteran serving the entire six years as an Aviation Electronics technician. The Navy veteran observer is familar with all types of military aircraft. The veteran observers says that the type of jet following the object was not military, it was commercial.The other observer has a medical professional background.<n>

I was lying flat on my back looking up hoping to spot some migratory waterfowl. Instead I saw a bright white/silver; oval shaped object surrounded by a blurry haze. It almost seemed as if the haze surrounding the object was moving or flapping. At this point I jumped up to my feet and while pointing I said to my buddy, who was in the front of the boat &#34;What the #### is that&#34;. I immediately pointed out the fact that what ever it was it was not leaving a contrail and was moving at a rate of speed faster than any aircraft that I have ever seen. I could not judge the height but I believe it to be at about the height at which one would typically see a commercial jet. The object was moving away from my location towards the north. I watched it until it was to small to see. It did not disappear from moving over the horizon; it seemed to disappear from gaining altitude. I do not know what it was but I do know it is definitely unidentified!<n>

I looked up at the stars, and saw what I believed to be a satellite going over.  The problem was, however, that there was a shape to the object, and that it deviated from its straight course of flight.  The object appeared to be quite high, and crescent-like in shape.  Its general direction was roughly WNW, and changed its course several times, almost zig-zagging.  After a few seconds, it moved behind some trees, so I moved a few feet over, and couldn&#39;t re-locate it.  I realize that this is pretty vague, and probably isn&#39;t of much use to you.  Sorry!<n>

We were driving along the highway when, to the SSE of us, I saw in the sky what I thought was just a particularly bright star. After a few minutes, it seemed to divide into two smaller stars, which began to circle each other. I rolled down my window because I thought it might be a reflection playing tricks on me. When I still saw the two &#39;stars&#39;, I called the attention of my friends to it. We observed it for a minute or so, then decided to pull over and get out to have a better look. After we stood for a few minutes, each of the two &#39;stars&#39; seemed to turn into a large white isosceles-type triagle, joined at two points kind of like a butterfly, like this : <n>&gt;&lt;<n> (The triangles were actually much longer top-to-bottom than that, but you get the idea) Eventually, the two triangles returned to the two stars, which eventually merged back into the one, whiched seemed to glow with a faint amber tint for the rest of the drive. We were at a loss for natural explanation, but we&#39;re no geniuses and I suppose there could be one. I don&#39;t know how it could be a terrestrial craft, and even if aliens and such really exist, it still seems an almost impossible design for a craft even with incredible technology, so who knows? Any ideas you might have would be appreciated.<n>

ANY clear night in Kenosha County even out my back door I can see at least 3 UFOs moving around. My last sighting was at the Fox River and Highway 50 fishing for Walleyes.  I always see UFOs out there.  There is  an Indian Effigy Mound near there on Highway 83 North of highway 50. It is shaped like a panther and stands for the &#34;water spirit.&#34; I have had over 200 sightings since 1996 and have seen a big yellow ship come out of the clouds in 1996 in front of my apartment as big as 4 city blocks with my friend and it lit the whole sky up and shot off at 90 degree angle in milliseconds. So sometimes the UFOs just move around a bit or streak off and make &#34;trails.&#34;  I have seen two UFOs making a &#34;U&#34; shaped pattern over and over at the Fox River also. I also have been abducted since age 5 and have seen aliens in my room. I still am being abducted and think I being used for genetic experiments and used for sexual purpose for some reason. Thanks!<n>

It was a clear cool night &amp; as we approached Hempstead Tpke.I noticed what appeared to be a glowing disc. I must admit it appeared to be very similar to those I have seen on TV documentaries about UFO&#39;s. There was a light emiting from the top downward to create the shape of the saucer. The color of the light was whitish blue. I pointed it out to my wife who also had the same reaction of awe as I did. I noticed that it wasn&#39;t moving in a straight line. First it moved toward the east,then slightly north,then ultimately westbound un- till we lost it behind some trees. Beacuse of its appearance and movement,we knew it couldn&#39;t have been a plane,heliocopter or even a blimp.  I assumed it would be clearly seen by thousands &amp; checked the Saturday &amp; then Sunday newspaper,Newsday,which is the largest on Long Island. They said no one had reported it &amp; since it had passed,they were not interested. I should call only at the moment I see it. I still plan to check the Long Island TV station-Channel 12 to see if they had any calls. I have to believe that many saw this as well but possibly were embarresed to call.<n>

As it slowly flew above me, time seemed to stay still.  When it disappeared over the tree tops I ran to tell my grandfather but he didn&#39;t believe me and he hadnt seen it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The triangle UFO was black and had lights around the edges.  It seemed to be the size of a commercial airliner.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous.  PD))<n>

It was only around 50 yards away and only 50 yards high. I thought it might have been some new kind of millitary machine, but it was completly silent other than a whoosh of air as it changed from a stationary mode to a low level flight path. It shot accross a field after hovering for about 10 seconds and then out of sight. At first I thought it was &#34;human&#34; because it had a red light in each corner of the triangle, but the 60 or so foot span and the silence of the object was very strange [I had my car windows down] No other reports were made in the area to the best of my knowledge.<n>

I remember it like it was yesterday . My dad , my brother , and I were in our car and were on our way to my dads girlfriend&#39;s house . It was very dark and cold and I was sitting in the backseat looking out my window . And from a distance I noticed a tiny object that had shimmering white light . I always watched shows on TV about aliens and so I told my dad that I think I see a UFO . My dad looked and said it was probably a helicopter . Well we came around a few streets and it looked like the craft was getting bigger and heading for our direction . Then my dad changed his mind and said he didn&#39;t know what the craft was . I was very young at this time so my brother and me was getting scared . As we came up this hill the object came over some trees and we saw that it was a saucer shape . I was terrified . My dad stopped the car in the middle of the street . There were no other cars in sight . The craft slowly flauted over our vehicle and into a yard where it floated over the top of a tiny house . I didn&#39;t know what to do . I was screaming telling my dad to go because I didn&#39;t want to get abducted !!! I thought it was going to blow that little house up !!! So as my dad slowly started to move the craft began to come out over the street . A tiny door towards the bottom of the craft began to open . It was behind us now over the street and I was staring out the back window . As the tiny door on the craft opened I saw a very very bright white light . I screamed louder and my dad I think got scared so he began to speed off and as I watched out the back window I saw the craft float off over some trees . We never saw the object after we searched through the skies again . I know that all sounds crazy...but it is the truth...and people seem to not believe when I tell the story...my mom has her doubts I think .<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

I walk about 6 blocks east.  I am looking into the sun as it is rising, very orange and pleasant to look at.  In the sky about 40 degrees or so above the horizon I see an contrail.  It caught my interest because of all the chemtrails, but this was very high, like a real contrail.  I thought it was a jet out of selfride air national guard base most likely.  The contrail wasnt very long, but the object glowed orange like the sun.  I figured the jet was shiney and reflecting the rising sun, but then it disappeared along witht he contrail.  I then noticed a second contrail like the first but south a bit from the first.  It was doing the same thing, then glowed the same and disappeared.  This was likely something entering the atmosphere, like meteorites or perhaps it was a couple jets.  It seemed odd for them to just disappear along with the contrail, and the contrail seemed short if it was a meteorite burning up.  I thought I would post this and see if anyone else saw it or knows what it was.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Report seems to us to be reminiscent of normal contrail activity.  PD))<n>

AFTER DISCOVERING THE FLOODED BASMENT AND OUR SUMP PUMP FAILING I WENT TO WALMART AND THEN TO MEIJER TO PURCHARE A SUMP PUMP AT AROUND 2 OR 2:30 IN THE MORNING.  ON THE WAY HOME HEADING NORTH ON TAYLORSVILLE RD I NOTICED MANY LIGHTS IN THE SKY IN SUCH A NARROW SIGHT RANGE.  THERE WERE SO MANY LIGHTS IN THE SKY AROUND 15 OR SO (A GUESS).  THERE WAS 3 LIGHTS THAT CAUGHT MY ATTENTION THE MOST.  THEY WERE IN THE TOP RIGHT OF MY VIEW OF SIGHT.  THESE 3 LIGHTS WERE IN THE SHAPE OF A TRIANGLE.  I ARRIVED HOME AND ASKED MY WIFE SOON TO BE TO COME LOOK AT THESE LIGHTS.  WE COULD NOT SEE THESE LIGHTS FROM OUR HOUSE SO WE DROVE BACK OVER TAYLORSVILLE RD AND OBSERVED THESE LIGHTS. THE SAME 3 LIGHTS HAD BARELY MOVED.  SOME OF THE OTHER LIGHTS I CAN ATTRIBUTE TO MAN MADE AIRCRAFT SUCH AS HELICOPTERS HOVERING.  THESE 3 BRIGHT LIGHTS HAD OTHER LIGHTS NEAR THEM IN A PERFECT STRAIGHT LINE RUNNING RIGHT TO LEFT.  AFTER WATCHING THIS EVENT FOR SEVERAL MINUTES, WE WENT HOME AND WORKED ON THE FLOODED BASEMENT AND TURNED ON THE RADIO TO LISTEN TO SEE IF ANYTHING HAD BEEN REPORTED.  OF COURSE NOTHING WAS ON THE NEWS.  I JUST FIND IT SO HARD TO UNDERSTAND WHY SO MANY LIGHTS WAS OVER THE CITY AT THAT TIME OF NIGHT.  WE DID NOT STAY FOR THE DURATION OF THIS EVENT DUE TO THE PROBLEM AT HOME, BUT THE TOTAL TIME DURATION THAT WE WITNESSED WAS ABOUT A HALF HOUR.<n>

The lights also swirled around the craft, while blinking.  As the craft went by us (we were driving) the back looked like a triangle, with three lights.  One at the top, and then two below it on the sides of it.We were heading west, and watched the craft travel southwest for a ways.  It was moving farely low to the tree level.  And looked of abnormal size.  We switched directions, instead of heading west, we turned south.  As we crossed a bridge, you could see it over the Kalamazoo River Bay, on M-89/M40.  The craft slowly lifted up higher then came down, back the direction it just came from.  Then it went below the tree line, and that was the last we saw of it.  Again, we don&#39;t think this was a plane at all...it was definetly in our opinion a ufo!<n>

At first it was yellowish-white light as it passed from EES to WWN, in variuos sporadic motions, that made it evident it was controlled.  It looped and then went out of view, 15 seconds later it returned and went back the opposite way.  The night was clear therefore it was clear to see it was not a satellite, particularly from its motions - neither was it aircraft or weather balloons.  I ahve experienced each of these types, also shooting stars and comets/meteors.  I also read indepthly about UFO phenomena and know from previuos discriptions that what we all ahd experienced was very extraordinary.<n>
10/19/00 20:00|Sherwood Park (Canada)|AB|Unknown|1 to 2 seconds|6+ beige colored objects, flying in a triangular formation, followed by a wispy column in the night sky over Sherwood Park, Alberta.|12/2/00|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/014/S14620.html|143|ndxe200010| 6+ beige colored objects, flying in a triangular formation, followed by a wispy column in the night sky over Sherwood Park, Alberta.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was standing in a pipeline right-of-way with my ten year old son and my six year old daughter , while we were exercising our dog.  I was facing south, when I looked up into the sky and noticed an object moving west to east.  It was very bright compared to the stars, but had the twinkling light quality of a star.  I thought that it probably was a satellite (or perhaps the space shuttle). It moved quite fast across the sky and disappeared within 15 - 30 seconds.  Then from behind my son and I (from the north) a triangular formation of six or more objects moved at a very fast speed toward the south (observable for only 2 - 3 seconds).  There were no lights on these ojbects.  They were a beige color and did not contrast very well with the dark sky.  They struck me as looking like a formation of geese, except  they moved way too fast and were very high in the sky.  In my memory, the object at the head of the formation was a degree or two out of line with the other objects following behind it.  I didn&#39;t see them long enough to make out their individual shape, but they were uniform.   At first, I thought I was seeing a spot light from the ground and so I was expecting the pattern to sweep back across the sky to the north, but the objects disappeared into the south.  It was then that I noticed a wispy vertical column moving at a comparable speed to the triangular objects, track across the sky in the same north to south movement.  There was no sound and and no light emanating from either the objects or the wispy column that followed them.  I watched the sky for a couple of minutes after the column disappeared into the south, and tried to figure out what it was I had seen.  I also was hoping that there would be more activity, but no other unusual effects or objects appeared. The pipeline right-of-way is located within 1/2 mile of the Strathcona Industrial Park where several large refineries create a considerable amount of light pollution, as do the housing developments that border the right-of-way on the east side.  Still, the sky was cloudless and dark enough that the big dipper was clearly visible when I was facing north in the right-of-way, as were the stars to the south.  It was also very easy to track the movement of the &#34;satellite&#34;, that I describe above, as it moved from west to east. I am curious if I saw a natural phenomenon, a light effect or a formation of military planes on a manouever?  What do you think?  My son saw all of these things as well, although when I asked him a few minutes afterward he couldn&#39;t describe any details.  He has the opinion that the objects may not be so easily explained as I think they probably are.  Thank you for providing this wonderful service.  I didn&#39;t realize the skies above Sherwood Park could be so exciting! Interestingly, the Canadian military base in Edmonton seemed uninterested.  They told me to call the RCMP.  The RCMP weren&#39;t able to help either  - &#34;What do they want us to do?  Chase it?&#34; was the response I got from them.  Hopefully, this is interesting to you.<n>

10/19/00 07:40|Salt Lake City|UT|Sphere|2-3 minutes|Round and metallic about 1/4 to 1/3 third the size of the planes they were were follwoing.|12/2/00|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/014/S14610.html|145|ndxe200010| Round and metallic about 1/4 to 1/3 third the size of the planes they were were follwoing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was outside feeding my dogs when I observed two (2) large possible military airplanes.  They didn&#39;t appear to be commercial planes because the wingspan was very wide.  They were flying from west to east, very fast and quite high.  Planes are not unusual in our neighborhood because we live within a couple of miles of Salt Lake Intl and also the national guard has an airport nearby.  Also, Hill Field is just a few miles north of here.  Anyway, what was UNUSUAL about these planes was that each plane had three (3) spheres that were flying in the same airspace.  At first I thought they were parachutes or something attached to each plane.  There were two spheres on one side and the third was on the opposite side.  This was the same formation for each plane.  The spheres appeared to be metallic and they were flying into the rising sun so they reflected a golden color, it may only have been the reflection of the sun.  I have never seen anything like this so I watched with great interest.  The planes were flying one ahead of the other and my have been about a half mile apart, I am only guessing because distance between them is difficult to determine.  Anyway, they were definately going somewhere together.  Then while I was watching I became aware of two (2) more spheres flying behind the planes and the distance appeared to be several miles behind the planes and the first six (6) spheres.  These spheres were not attached to anything.  They also appeared to be metallic and they were at apporximately the same altitude and speed.  They all disappeared over the mountains within a few minutes.  The planes were the only thing that I could hear.  The second set of spheres did not make any noticable noise.  I called my husband as soon as I got to work and told him what happened.  It was very interesting and I decided to report this incident to your organization and see if anyone else has seen anything like this.  Thank you for being there.  I have been paying attention to the skies for a long time now, Salt Lake City ! has cont rails almost everyday.  Anyway, that&#39;s another subject.  I will continue to watch every morning, especially while I&#39;m feeding my dogs.<n>

We were facing a NW direction. The object was moving towards the SW. It was larger than anything I have ever seen in the sky before. My daughter yelled out asking me what it was. We have a lot of planes in the sky here. This was 10 to 15 times larger than any airplane I have ever viewed before. It cast a yellow color not like a normal plane. There were no other colors on it to be seen. Any other planes I have observed out here have been white. This object was moving too fast for a plane. There was no noise to be heard with this object. If I were to hold my thumb up it would have been the 3/4 the width of the end of my thumb .I was not wearing my glasses so I asked my daughter to tell me what shape she was seeing and she confirmed that it was an elongated shape like a cigar which is exactly what I was seeing. As the object moved to our left it reached a tree line and was still well above the line and then suddenly it just disappeared. My daughter yelled at me asking where it went. It was like someone had turned off a light. It literally just vanished. My two granddaughters were observing it also. We watch the skies out here often. This is unlike anything I had ever observed. If it had been close there would have been some kind of noise. But this thing was moving way too fast for any kind of craft I have ever observed. After it disappeared I noticed at least two planes in the sky moving as usual with their red and green flashing lights. Everything looked normal. Up until this morning my daughter has always been a skeptic when it came to strange things in the sky. This morning she was very frightened.<n>

Upon this wish, I had noticed that this &#39;star&#39; was moving.  Thinking I was maybe lucky to be wishing upon a falling star, I watched it.  It was no star.  It was moving far too closely...  far too fast, and did not fade out.  The light was to my left and I followed it.   As it got closer, I noticed red and greed flashing lights spinning in a circular motion.  This was no plane, helicopter, nor any other flying object I am aware of.  As my eyes followed further, there was another object of the same directly, and hovering, over me.   The two met, as if to collide, and each then went seperate ways.   I have never experienced nor witnessed any such a thing.  Ever. This incident was very close to my house.  One of the objects was still in my view as I aproached my house, my dog barking wildly at nothing.  I ran to the door and called for my brother to &#39;come quick!&#39;.  However, it was gone that fast. To say the least, I&#39;m a little &#39;freaked out&#39;!<n>

Object was like reflective like when a mirror is reflecting sun rays.  The size of the object from our vantage point would appear the size of a classroom earth globe.  Lonnie commented it must be very large considering the distance.  Object viewed for approximately 15 minutes and it was stationary and glittering bright.  Object then plusated not at a high rate of speed, slightly northeast until unable to view.  The vicinity is sparse with cattle grazing and a high voltage line crossing through.  Can you give me an idea.  From our position, 20 - 25 miles would place object somewhere south west of Fowler, Colorado<n>
10/18/00 22:15|McKinney|TX|Light|15 minutes|As we were both watching this thing, it went due South over the horizon in a fraction of a second|6/12/08|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/062/S62882.html|150|ndxe200010| My wife and I were enjoying a glass of wine by the outdoor fireplace at approximately 22:15 on a cool clear fall evening. We live North of Dallas in McKinney Texas, with an unobstructed view to the South. I have grown up around aircraft and I am very knowledgeable about most types of air planes. Our house seems to be located in a position that gets a large amount of Care-Flight helicopters either directly over, or very near our location. We were watching the air traffic coming and going out of Love Field, DFW and Addison airport, always trying to figure out who was going where. We noticed what we assumed to be a Care-Flight or a private plane headed directly towards us from Love Field (due South). It was a bright red/orange light that resembled a bright landing light or a spot light on the front of a helicopter that was pointed towards us from a distance of approximately 10 – 15 miles and at a low altitude of 500 – 1500 agl (above ground level). After several minutes, we noticed that the aircraft never seemed to get any closer. At that time I got my binoculars out to get a better look at what was going on. The only thing that I could tell was that the red/orange light was all that I could see. I thought I should have been able to see a rotating beacon and anti-collision lights. After a total of approximately 5 - 6 minutes, the light moved due West. Now that I had what should be a side view of the craft, I knew that I could see the rotating beacon and the anti-collision lights. Not only were there no other lights, the spotlight seemed to still be pointed to the North. This is when we both knew we were seeing something that just wasn’t quite right. It was moving to the West at about the speed a fast moving helicopter would be going at a distance of about 5- 10 miles. After a few more minutes, it stopped again. Trying to rationalize what we were seeing, I thought a larger aircraft descending out of the South towards Love Field and then turning towards DFW (this may be possible due to the ru! nways at Love are 33 – 13 and DFW are 36 – 18), but we still couldn’t figure out why the light was that bright and moving that slow. The light was now standing still over DFW for another 4 – 5 minutes. As we were both watching this thing, it went due South over the horizon in a fraction of a second. After we could see the light move over the horizon, I had the feeling that the light was much larger and higher than what we had first assumed. I now believe it was approximately 5,000 agl, assuming that it was indeed over Love Field and DFW. The size of the light was approximately the size of a bb at arm’s length. The next morning we anxiously watched the news for a story on this light over Dallas, there was no mention of anything. I called the towers at Love Field, DFW and approach control via land line and no one knew anything about what we had witnessed the night before. I just pray that it was ours.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.  PD))<n>

Then I realized that if it was a garland, I wouldn&#39;t see it (since it was dark already) and even if I did, it would be moving in the wind, whereas the shape of what I saw was completely static. So I suddenly realized that I was seeing some flying object, as it was advancing in the air very steadily (not high speed at all), and it looked like I was seeing the back of the object (nothing else showed). I could follow it for maybe 20 or 30 seconds, and then the orangy glow slowly disappeared as it moved further away towards the East. It was absolutely silent and didn&#39;t seem very high in the sky (unless it is a gigantic object). Had I not looked up at that very moment (when the &#34;garland&#34; was vertically above me and the most visible) , I probably wouldn&#39;t have noticed the object at all.<n>

I had just walked to the (front) southeast corner of the house trying to find the moon.  As I was walking back to the northeast side of the house I was facing east when I saw three dim white lights in a straight line of a 45 degree angle equally spaced and without any sound fly from north to south above the houses across the street no more than a 1000 feet above ground level.  I shouted to my son (his name and) Look! Both of us observed and described the same thing to include that as we watched this object we observed between the three dim lights a &#34;fuzziness&#34; or blurring as if the three lights were connected but the connecting material was not possible to be clearly discerned.  This all took place in no more than 10 seconds.  The object(s) then suddenly vanished.  I am a ((profession deleted--public servant)) and ((military title))  who flew ((deleted--100+)) combat missions out of southeast asia with a top secret clearance at the time.  I would not mind being contacted about this but I will not allow my name or the name of my son or family to be publicly identified.  There is a small airport (Lantana) within 3-4 miles of our house to the northeast and we did notice one or two discernable aircraft lights at a distance that night in the area of the airport but not apparently involved in this incident.<n>

At first I thought Fire/Coast Guard hellicopters, as there is a C.G. Base near here and we did have a large grass fire by the bay North of here. After watching maybe one minute or so I ran and called my wife to the front of our house. At this time we saw two orange lights heading Northeast of our house. They seemed to have been fairly low moving like a C.G.Hellicopter would. They were not making any sound nor were any lights flashing. After about two minutes they stopped in flight. They were motionless for another two minutes or so and my wife went to call our daughter and son-in-law who live about ten blocks from us. When she returned with phone in hand and son-in-law on the other end, we all watched the light on the left move to the North at about the same speed as before. The one on the right never moved again. After 4-5minutes the one on the right started flickering brightly and then was gone. Our son-in-law said he saw something drop from it before it&#39;s light was gone. The one to the North was visible for another 2-3 minutes and it&#39;s light flickered and it was gone too.<n>

There is a pond beyond my fence and some full grown ficus trees on the other side.  I was looking into the clear sky&#39;s east ward at a 45 degree angle looking over the tops of the ficus across the pond.  From over my head I saw something moving at a high rate of speed and as it past the tops of the trees it flashed.  At first I thought it was just a shooting star, but shooting stars are high in the atmosphere and this couldn&#39;t have been more than 4-5,000 feet.  It took a while for me to comprehend what occured and my memory of the flash sparked what I saw, a diamond shaped object that briefly flashed a white lite I have never seen before, left no trail and moved at extremely high velocity.<n>

Two days ago on 16 October 2000, I was coming together with other 7 friends from a trip in the Danube Delta, which is located in Romania on the river Danube at the end towards the Black Sea near the city of Tulcea. At about 19:00 h local time, we all witnessed a luminous light phenomena which none of us could explain. Before presenting the event, please note that I personally am a very skeptical person in what concerns the UFO. I red a lot about that and I really believe that it is very unlikely that our planet has ever been visited by aliens. Nevertheless, at the above mentioned hour, while we were travelling by boat on the river Danube we all saw a group of five flashing lights hovering over the Danube Delta. I would like to mention that clearly those lights were not stars and they were not attached to any visible artificial object. The size of the group of lights I believe was measurable in kilometers. I would not want to bore you with a long and probably irrelevant story; the fact is that I have the event recorded on a videotape. My intention is to ask for your advice in how can I have this tape studied by experts providing that I keep the copyright. Thank you in advance, ((name deleted))<n>

I was looking westward, the sun had already begun to set behind the horizon. The object appeared in front of a group of clouds in the western sky. As it appeared it was stationary and became very bright, then it appeared to move a short distance southward. It then stopped, faded and disappeared exactly opposite of how it had appeared. There were no flashing lights, no strobes, nothing that that would identify it as an airplane.   I know what airplanes look like, and I&#39;ve seen a fair share of meteors and this object didn&#39;t behave like either. There were no other objects in the sky at the time.<n>

While driving home from shopping, I saw an bright glowing white object. It was like seeing a bright, white florescent light tube flying smoothly in a steady path from south to north at approximately 2000 ft altitude. I&#39;d estimate it was approximatly 60 ft in length and about 15 ft diameter and it was cylinderical/cigar shaped. It was not moving very fast, approximately 100 to 200 mph and it was completely silent. It was heading in my general direction from the  south west. As it got closer I noticed a slight trail of smoke behind it but heard no engine sounds and observed no flames or anything else to accound for the smoke trail. The smoke trail made me think that someone might be playing a prank and sent up a small rocket with a light tube inside it. However, I observed no wings and it moved horizontally at a constant velocity and was not falling or descending as a rocket normally would without any propulsion. So I dismissed the &#34;prank-rocket&#34; and was left not knowing what it was. There were no marker lights, windows or any other lights aircraft normally have.   While driving south, I watched it through my windshield for about 1/2 minute as it got closer. Then I turned off highway 29 at the Dry Creek Exit to better observe it and to make sure I don&#39;t pass it. I watched it for a few more seconds and then I realized that I better park the car safely off the road to avoid someone rear ending my car. I took my eyes off it for just a few seconds to park off the road and get out of the car and when I looked up again it was gone.  All that was left was a thin trail of smoke that ended abruptly where I last observed it.<n>

It seemed to be directly in the middle of the moon. Now this craft was very large in size and was lit up all over and just appeared out of nowhere. I mean literally that it was if someone just turned on a bunch of colorful lights.We were traveling eastbound on highway 16 towards U.S. 31and approximately 12-15 miles from GRISSOM AFB. When it appeared i kinda shook my head to make sure i was seeing correctly and turned to the back to look at my daughter, who had fallen off to sleep. I look to my left and it was still there traveling slowly heading in a eastern direction. I then look to the south where GAFB is located and notice in the southern, southern east and straight east sky a numerous amount of aircraft. At this time the large craft ,what i would describe now was in a triangular or a diamond shape that seemed to be picking up speed and gaining altitude. At the first moment i spotted this craft out of my drivers side window (which would be the north) i instantly was like WHOA!! But now that it had been gaining speed i  tried to keep up at a rate of about 80mph but thought that it was not wise to jeopardize my daughters life traveling at a high rate of speed to try to catch something that is impossible to catch. Anyway, this craft from what i could see was now very far from me to the point that i had lost sight of it all together, but the planes were still in the air. i myself had a hard time putting this altogether because i have been really inerested in ufo&#39;s but when this sighting happened i thought no way  someone like me that is on the look out for them could actually encounter one.  I firmly believe that this was the real deal and can&#39;t really tell anyone for they would call me crazy. I ! have rep orted another encounter to you most recently on large yellow lights in sky hovering. I have no idea what triggered me to recount this, but it is not the only ones i have witnessed. I have also seen one yellow hovering light that has changed location and on another account of a huge red fire ball with blue and yellow tint of what seemed to be a meteorite kind of decending at an angle.  Again, this fire ball just appeared out of nowhere and rather instantly. I hope all this and my other report will be taken under consideration for investigation for all of them have been in the same vicinity of GRISSOM AFB. I don&#39;t understand it all but wonder what the significants is with me seeing these objects all around the same area. Once again this craft was intensly bright a huge and have all been around the same time except for the fireball of some sort which occured around 11:30p.m.<n>

I noticed that contrains where being made by 2 jets . AT ABOUT 15,000 FT. 2 DOTS APPEARED BEHIND THE CONTRAIL PATH OF ONE OF THE JETS Contrails. I used 10X50&#39;s to follow the jets so I had them with me when I noticed the dots stationary. At first they seemed to be fixed wing air craft but they where above the jet trails. The shape seemed to change to a ball shape and stayed that way. they soon drifted apart and then one just disappeared. The second one stayed insight for a minute and then disappeared into the clouds. After teen minutes it didn&#39;t repair.<n>

It was dusk and we took the highway. we went pass a large field.  And I saw airplane lights but did not pay much attention.  I wondered why the plane was flying over the field. It was rush hour traffic. We picked up the food and headed back to Henderson.  I thought my daughter was going to take the highway home again, but she did not.  She went on the highway for a while than took a country road that had no traffic on it.  She slowed down her driving and was talking a lot to me. I had a strange feeling,  So I leaned forward in the car and looked up and saw lights above her car. Her car was like a sports car and the windows lean and was easy to look up out of.  The craft was huge and boomrang shape and had 5 large round lights under it. and not flashing lights like our aircraft or a beam.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I became very fearful but did not say anything to my daughter because I did not want her to stop the car or try to get out of the car to look at it.  And I never told her about it for  years. I was very angry and afraid,  Because I never wanted to a UFO.<n>

Standing on the Tee box looking down the hole about 423 yds we saw a bright light almost too bright to look at. It seemed to have a round/disc shape. This light was hovering above the green eraticaly moving up and down about 10 to 15 feet at a time. The size of this light was within the size of the green no more than 25-30 feet across.

Their heads were bigger then their body and ca<n> <n><n> <n><n> Dear Sir, I know you all may not believe me on the one I sent you last night. here is the one story ealier. I write it as a story of the events that happen. I have no answers to why me? You all can call me I cannot run from this any more. Visitors on A Cold Night Sometime last year I received a visit from two strangers. As the year passed, I have not heard from these strange visitors. One day out of nowhere they came in the earlier morning to see me. This day was very cold. They came from a far away place that was not known to us. One day during the week it was very cold. The wind was blowing very hard so my home was cold. The heaters did not do their job very well. As the night fell our trailer was getting colder. My family and I had blankets over them to stay warm. We all sat next to the heater as the wind and cold came through the trailer, so the evening was very cold. Bedtime came and I put my boys, B((deleted)) and J((deleted)) to bed. Even, though their room was cold their heater did the job, as it was suppose to. B and J fell asleep. My husband ((deleted)) and I went back to the living room to sit down and have some cocoa to warm our cold bodies. Then we went back to watching TV for the rest of the night. As time went by we became aware it was 10:00 p.m., the news came on. Even though it was very cold in our trailer, we still enjoyed each other&#39;s company. After the news I decided to get up and go to bed. It took a few minutes to get settled down for a good night sleep. I do remember laying my head down on my pillow for a few minutes. I do not remember anything until 1:30 a.m. in the early morning. I do recall waking up for a glass of water and going to use the restroom. Then I returned to bed and fell back to sleep. Suddenly, I heard this sound that woke me up out of a sound sleep. This sound was so far away as it traveled in a downward, vertical descent from the sky. This sound was nothing like a plane engine. The noise had been getting louder and louder as I had been lying in bed shaking from the fear of what was going to happen to me. I could not even move out of my bed to get my family up so they could hear what I was hearing. This shaking and terror that my body was feeling is something no matter what I say will never allow a person to understand what it felt like to be so afraid that your body can not even move to get help. The time was 2:00 a.m. in the morning when I first heard this noise. I tried everything to move; no matter how hard I tried I began to shake worse from the terror that I was hearing coming down toward me. My fear had been so strong that I could not protect my family and I tried to hide like a scared cat running away from what I could not see. Suddenly, I turned and looked at my clock, which said 2:30 a.m. The visitors were in my room holding on to my shoulders one on each side. I do not even remember how I became very warm and standing straight up; I was moving, but my legs were not. It felt like I was leaving a house front door and going into a doorway with a bright white light. Both of these little people had long arms and big black eyes. They were shorter then me. Their heads were bigger then their body and came to my shoulder. I felt as though I was not in my trailer at all. I do not have a door where my bedroom windows are.  Even though I felt at peace with whatever happened to me, I still do not understand it all. I do not remember anything after I went to the light. When I was returned to my room on my bed, I was shaking from fear again from the sound as this noise was now leaving straight up into the sky. I turned my head to the clock and it said 4:30 a.m. After the noise left, I calmed down; it took me a little while to stop shaking. I finally got up to go through the doorway to get my husband. Suddenly, there were smells in my room that I could not tell where they came from. They were very strong in odor. Then in just a few minutes the smell was gone. I still to this day do not know what happened. I was awake. I am one who will always find a way to protect my family, but this time I could not protect anyone, not even myself.

Mid-way through the conversation I noticed to the North of me 9 eggshaped objects flying in a &#34;V&#34; formation from east to west. I told my wife what I was watching and because she was on a farm about two miles North it would have been possible for her to see them too, but from the other side. She was unable to locate them in the 45sec. or so it took them to fly west. The objects were an &#34;off&#34; white and completely silent. Some of the objects changed place in the formation and if they were geese, as what I first thought was possible I would have seen their wings move. These objects maintained level flight through out. I phoned the local military base and they knew nothing and showed no interest I my description.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

It ran North/South,was white in color against the blue sky and had what appeared to be circles or lines across it running East/West at equal intervals across the entire visable length. It was not other contrails cutting across it. They were short lines. I have never seen a contrail anything like this ever and have no idea what produced it and there has to be lots and lots of other observers. I dont know if an aircraft or type of UFO produced this,but if airplane,its not anything I have ever seen before. NOTE: I come from an aviation family,have been flying,and flying in planes my entire life and for me to make note of a contrail after seeing countless thousands,(some up close),then it has to be something that is significant and very very strange.<n>
10/15/00 04:00|Nassau Bay|TX|Oval|3-4 seconds|Bright Green Oval Highspeed bigger than a full moon|7/16/06|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/051/S51303.html|184|ndxe200010| Bright Green Oval Highspeed bigger than a full moon<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was fishing. I don&#39;t know if I only saw the end of it or the whole thing.  I don&#39;t know how far up or away from me the object was.  From my view it looked to be about 1 and a half times as big as a full moon, just slightly oval, a very bright neon green in color, the brightness of the object stopped at edge of the object or in other words the object&#39;s brightness didn&#39;t project into the darkness around it and fade to black like other types of light do that we are used to in the dark or in a night sky.  I would say this thing moved at least twice as fast as a fighter jet.  There was no sound at all! The path direction that took 3 to 4 seconds was in a slight curve down towards the horizon but the object appeared to disappear just before the horizon. From where I was fishing, I was looking over Clearlake towards the Hilton Hotel and Nasa is right there.  ???????  I don&#39;t know what to think about this.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I was fishing on a dock facing south on Clear Lake just west of Seabrook, TX. Actually I was in El Lago, TX.  In a south/southwest direction up in the sky, way up above the Hilton Hotel and was already in motion and continued in a perfect geometrical arc in direction and down towards and disappearing, not over the horizon, but just above the west horizon.  Object appeared to me about 1 and 1/2 times the size of a full moon, just off of round.  I would say slightly egg shaped.  Object had no sound and moved from where I started to see it to where it disappeared in about a fourth of the time it would take a fighter plane to travel.   Now then, the color and radiance of the object stayed the same throughout the sighting.  It was a very bright light green almost like a glowing type of green although it didn&#39;t do any glowing.  Just the object itself had the color and light.  There was no light emitting off of it into the surrounding dark sky or a! ny halo and I hope I am discribing this so as to give an accurate picture.  There is no way to come up with a guess on the actual size of the object or how far it was from earth.   And like I said there was no sound, perfect arc descending pattern,  size abnormally large compared to anything that we would normally see in our sky.  Speed incredibly fast compared to our F16&#39;s, etc. and the way the light emitted from the object was not normal.   This happened in Oct of 2000.  I reported this on this site back in 05 or 06 although I can&#39;t find my sighting in your archives.  I would really like for someone to let me know if this was something that has a logical explanation behind it.   Nasa is right there at that end of the lake.  If this is something of our government, we have nothing to fear from other country&#39;s military might.  This object was definitely unidentified by me, however until there is some proof, it doesn&#39;t mean that there were alien beings in it. Someone else had to ! have seen this!  I was 34 at that time and was not under the i! nfluence of drugs and/or alcohol.  I am not mentally insane and I am not retarded.  You can reach me at 903-((number deleted)). I welcome your call. Have a God Blessed day.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date in September 1993 is approximate.  PD))<n>
10/15/00 04:00|Mt. Kisco|NY|Light|1 minute|Only yards away from a tribe of UFO's for one full minute or so in Mt. Kisco, New York|5/15/06|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/050/S50342.html|186|ndxe200010| Only yards away from a tribe of UFO&#39;s for one full minute or so in Mt. Kisco, New York<n> <n><n> <n><n> On this particular night/morning around 4:00am-4:30am I was driving my taxi from New Rochelle to Mt. Kisco, New York with 4 mexicans I picked up from a bar in New Rochelle.  It was a clear dark night as I was traveling on the Hutchison Parkway merging on to the 684 Highway northbound.  I always travel on the 684 with my highbeams on at night. As Iam driving on the 684 and get past exit 3, half way to exit 4 which is about at least 2 miles between exit 3 and exit 4, the last mile to exit 4 was like day time bright, and I even shut off my highbeams.  I was looking around to see where they installed these new lights and could not find nothing to explain where these lights were coming from.  Well I dropped off my customers at Mt.Kisco and rushed back in about 10  minutes to see exactly where those lights were coming from.  When I got back on the 684 southbound it was like pitch black again.  Could not understand what happen to those bright lights that just disappeared.  Well I turned my highbeams on again and I was looking around everywhere to see what just happened.  Could not find anything to explain where those extremely brights were coming from.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Well here comes the good part of this story.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The next day I woke up around 4-5 o&#39;clock in the evening and turned on my TV.  At 6:00pm the news came on and the Anchor Reporter had news coming in from Arizona that over 200 people called the Arizona police to report sightings of about 7-8 bright disc flying in formation in Arizona through the evening sky.  Those bright lights that I saw at 4-4:30am in the morning that same day in Mt.Kisco were probably the same lights those 200 people saw who called the Arizona police that evening in Arizona.  In Mt.Kisco between Northbound and Southbound between exit 3 and 4 there are mountains of trees about maybe 20 to 30 yards wide.  These UFO&#39;s were hiding above those trees in Mt.Kisco while I was traveling that night. I was only yards away from a tribe of aliens from another world for just a short minute or so, interesting experience.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.

My wife and I are from AL. I&#39;m in the military and I was stationed at Eglin in Ft Walton Florida. I would drive up to Alabama and stay with my in-laws during the weekend and hunt. I consider myself sane, that&#39;s why I&#39;m doing this. On this night my brother-in-law and myself were riding around &#34;sober&#34; he doesn&#39;t drink. I don&#39;t remember if it was clear over us or not but there was a storm way off to the south. I remember seeing the lightning. My in-laws house is set close to the highway, aprox. 60 yards from the road with a driveway that goes all the way around the house between it and the shop. We pulled into the east driveway at aprox. 03:00 and stopped behind the house with the truck headed south west. At the same time we looked at an object set behind the shop and over a field aprox. 200 yards away and about 100 feet off the ground. At first I thought it was the moon because it looked just like a full moon and about the same size. Then it moved West at aprox. 30 MPH. It never changed direction. It went about 300 yards or so and dissapeared. I didn&#39;t see a trail or anything. It just vanished. I know there&#39;s some explination for it, I just don&#39;t know what it is. That&#39;s one reason I&#39;m writing this. We told family members but we didn&#39;t report anything. We very seldom ever talk about it. I told my dad about it and he said that my uncle and cousin had a very similiar experience in Camden AL. It would have been in the late 70s early 80s. He says they were looking at the full moon and then noticed that there was two of them. Then one moved and dissapeared. Maybe it&#39;s hereditary. Ha Ha. I wasn&#39;t going to write but I see that some other people on here have seen a similiar full moon type object. Just thought I&#39;d share my experience. Keep up the good work.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  Location in Alabama is unknown to us.  PD))<n>

I was half way down the block, and I saw a round fireball appear just out of nowhere in the skyline. It was greenish- blue and had a &#34;tail&#34;. It scared me because it was much bigger than any shooting star I&#39;ve seen. My gut feeling was that if this thing hit,it would cause some damage. It appeared to have just burned out in the sky. The conditions here in the Metro Area,are partly cloudly. This object was behind the cloudcover,but it was so bright,it clearly showed through.<n>

It was overcast and the light dimmed slighly as it moved in the clouds.  It appeared to come from no where and suddenly disappeared lasting approximately 2 secs.  It was large and moving very fast, especially considering how far away it was.  It was way to fast to be a plane.  It appeared to me to be moving straight across the sky although my wife thought it waivered a bit.  Did any body else in the GTA see this?  It was quite noticable.  Neither my wife nor I have ever seen anything of the sorts before.<n>

It came from the west (we were in the west side of town) &amp; as it moved overhead we could see it was silvery &amp; seemed to be reflecting what looked like flames (we could only see the bottom side).  It was really weird, it didn&#39;t seem to have any lights on it- or at least any we could see.  But the Whole bottom part we could see was silvery &amp; reflecting flames- so it was very bright!! The flames were moving, like real flames, so there were at times places on this aircraft (?!) that didn&#39;t have any flames &amp; it was hard to tell whether it was silvery or kind of almost &#34;invisible&#34; sort of blending in to the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Eventually it moved over us &amp; we couldn&#39;t see it anymore.  We were asking each other: did ! we just really see that?!  But we kinda figured it was maybe a test of some kind of craft that&#39;s being tested for blending in better &amp; Not any kind of alien tech.  Maybe we weren&#39;t supposed to see it?! Maybe they (gov?! Military?!) would&#39;ve liked to know if it was seen?! Didn&#39;t know what to think of this or what to do?! (Maybe the pilot pushed the wrong button &amp; accidentally made them visible?!) don&#39;t understand the flame part?!  (Unless it&#39;s part of the test?!)<n> <n><n> <n><n> I haven&#39;t read that many other sightings- but so far I&#39;ve never heard of or read anyone seeing this exact type of craft.  So I thought, after finding this site, I should report it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This sighting was several years ago (around Sept- Oct 2000, it&#39;s now 9-15-2014.) we didn&#39;t know what to think of what we saw or who to possibly report it to- so just now reporting it, partly since I found this website.<n>

We all got excited and walked over to the western edge of the parking lot to watch this light source behind the coluds in the west. It was the same size as a full moon behind the clouds. We talked excitedly as to what it could be and became excited as a rift in the clouds started to drift toward the light, we thought for sure then we would know. To our surprise and confusion the object moved to the other side of the rift in a split second, and you couldn&#39;t see it move across the rift just one second it was on one side of the rift the next second it was on the other side of the rift, it did that several times during the 6 minutes we watched it, I asked the guys if they would be against reporting this to NUFORC and they said that would be fine so one of the men, ((name deleted)) called right then and there while we were still witnessing the object but there was no answer. We continued to watch the object hover until another rift would come and then it would just jump over what looked like  5 inches from our perspective and then it would be still behind clouds we all watched as finally after al this it just blinked out. One of the other men and I swore a few times we saw some kind of flash come from the object through the clouds,it also seemd sometimes to have a greenish hue to the light . it was so weird...<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Anonymous report, so we have not way of getting back to the witness(es) to request more information.

I was looking at the unusual number of contrails in the sky to the west of the town, when we both noticed what at first we thought was an extremely large airplane banner in the sky at about 2 o&#39;clock high. It was rectangular in shape. Then we realized that there was no plane in front, and it was not moving. It looked to be about 2 miles away, and appeared to be the size of a football field. We observed it for about 30 seconds, until trees blocked the view. On subsequent trips past this area, we haven&#39;t seen anything that could resemble it, so we know it wasn&#39;t something that we mistook for a ufo (like a billboard, microwave tower, etc.).<n>

Behind the aircraft a very clearly defined contrail extended for perhaps 1/4 to 1/2 mile.  Towards the tail end of the contrail, there appeared a black object about the size of an automobile.  This object followed the aircraft at a fixed distance, always remaining perfectly centered within the contrail.  No wings or control surfaces were visible on the object, but it appeared metallic in composition because it seemed to reflect the light from the sun, which was low on the horizon. It was difficult to determine the exact shape of the object because it was engulfed in the vapor trail, but it was consistently visible and did not disappear at any point during the time the aircraft was in sight.  Other patrons nearby immediately noticed the object, despite that I had only pointed at the aircraft and did not mention the UFO.  One person commented that it was as if the aircraft was towing the black object, although no towing cable was visible.  During the course of the sighting, the contrail rapidly dispersed about 100 feet behind the black object, leaving no evidence of the aircraft&#39;s passage.<n>

I watched it for about 5-7 seconds untill it was blocked from my view by some trees. I then got up &amp; went up to my fence so that I couls see it again when it came out from behind the trees. I did see it again for approximately 3 more seconds untill again it went behind some trees. The object was traveling 3 to 4 times faster then any jet airpalne that I&#39;ve ever seen, perhaps faster. There was no sound relative to this object. There was no deviation of it&#39;s coarse, it traveled in a straight line. Perhaps it was a satellite but the satellites I&#39;ve seen previosuly were at night &amp; much slower.<n>

It had what appeared to be lights alternating colors from red to yelow to white to blue and orange. My wife thought it was a helicopter or lights on a tower but I got my binoculars and it was way to high. We then thought ok its a star or something but as we watched it you can tell the stars were moving and this object was not. We woke up my wifes mom to verify that there was no tower with lights in that direction and we all watched it for over an hour. It was to far away to disearn a shape. We did call the Escondido PD. After about an hour or so the object shot up at about a 60 degree angle and dissapeared. We looked for it the next night but saw nothing...<n>

It looked similar to Moon light breaking through a cloud, except there were three lights (and a fourth more faint). The three brightest lights were shaped in a triangle pattern and where not moving. They were about an extended arms length apart (like one hand on the 10 and the other on the 2 of a clock).  The fourth fainter light was off to one side from our position. They were almost overhead, possibly 15-20 degrees looking down, if looking directly overhead was 0 degress. Suddenly all four lights came together in the middle, they merged, moved down very slightly and then went out. The fourth light seemed to be just a hair behind the other lights as they merged together.  The movement happened in about 1 second. The lights seemed to be shining down, but it is difficult to tell as the clouds were obscuring them from a direct sighting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness appears to be describing advertising light, but that is a guess.

10/13/00 20:00|Eugene (west of)|OR|Light|3-5 min.|Lights over the Oregon Coastal Mountains.|12/2/00|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/014/S14587.html|202|ndxe200010| Lights over the Oregon Coastal Mountains.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was just after 8pm on Friday night, the 13th of October, 2000.  I was out in the Elsea Unit of Oregon settling in for dinner in my vehicle after a day of hunting.  The area I was in is west of Eugene.  I parked at the very top of one of the highest mountains in the area, right at the edge of a clear-cut. I could see for miles over the tops of many surrounding mountains.  The sunset was at 6:33pm that night.  There was a bank of clouds flowing filling the valleys and another wave of clouds floating over the mountain tops.  I looked up at the horizon and saw some small lights in the distance.  I figure that they are maybe 5 miles away.  The lights are white for the most part and changed in intensity. The color would sometimes be yellow or red.  The group consisted of four lights that would &#34;dance&#34;; or &#34;play&#34; around in a relatively tight grouping.  About the area of a dime at arms length. My first thought was that they were other hunters traversing the mountains. From my vantage point however, I could see they were above the other mountains and moving much too fast for a car or truck viewed from this distance.  A couple times one of the lights would dip down into a valley, but never low enough to go out of sight.  The light dipping into the valley meant that it couldn&#39;t be lights of a distant town flickering through the clouds.  After a couple minutes, I noticed another group to the right of the first. It was more of a line of 5-6 light closer together.  The way they flickered made me believe that they were flames of a large fire.  That was until one from the first group moved over to join the line. A few seconds later, it or another one returned to the first group.  Roughly five minutes had elapsed before I realized I had the digital camcorder.  I climbed outside to get a better shot.  It took several tries to get anything to show up on tape due to the distance in the dark. I switched it to infrared.  Nothing. I turned up the gain. It worked.  The lights and tree tops were present although fairly grainy.  I managed to get one minute recorded to tape before the clouds became too thick. In the morning, I cammed the same direction for sake of comparison and took nine gps readings to comfirm exactly where I was standing.<n>

I stepped out on my front porch at approx. 8 pm and looked up to see how clear the sky was, and saw what I initially thought was a single small cloud, but symmetrical with a sort of cresent or chevron shape, moving from directly overhead to due South.  It was moving in a straight line from North to South but much faster than a cloud and did not change shape until it disappeared beyond other houses.  There was no noise, no distinguising lights.  It appeared the size of my thumb and forefinger extended at arms length and would have traveled from horizon to horizon in less than 15 seconds. I do not know the altitude, so actual size and speed would be impossible to determine. I thought perhaps it had been one of these rotating ground spotlights, but it moved in a straight line rather than an arc, there were no clouds to reflect off of, no beam, and it never came around again.  After seeing it, I recalled seeing a similar event a couple of years ago while in my backyard, but on a very cloudy night, and just dismissed it as a lower, fast moving cloud - Now I&#39;m not so sure.<n>

At the same time a unidentified blue object showering sparks overtook the fighters and reportedly crashed into the ground north of the town of Elk City, Oklahoma. City police was monitored as saying &#34;it looked like meteors, or a comet, or a UFO...&#34; It was seen by multiple witness&#39;s from as far west as Shamrock Tx and east to Clinton, Ok. north to Cheyenne, and south to Granite, Ok. The object was seen to have landed north of town and had started a fire, this was reported by Hammond, Ok. Police. Elk City: A witness called in and reported that the object hit and broke up into 4 to 6 pieces and landed in their farm and no damage was noted. It was also described as an aircraft down, west of the town of Sayre, it was also reported as a aircraft exploded north of I-40 near the state line of Texas. It seems we have a multipliable witness sighting here. Police officer quote- &#34;It was neat&#34; Officer noted a vapor trail. Reported as &#34;sparks in the air&#34; by Roger Mills County Sheriff&#39;s office. Sayre Sheriff&#39;s office says it&#39;s a bright light in the sky, not a meteor!, and the officers are asking if they plan to have anymore?... At 7:43PM the FAA from Oklahoma City reported it was a meteor shower. Officers replied that it was NOT a meteor, they are contacting Altus AFB for radar. About this time I made a personal observation out my back door, and I noticed a white, luminous vapor trail that went from my southwest to the northeast. There were several other trails in the area north, but they appeared normal in color. I saw no other lights or objects or aircraft in the area. At 7:53 Amarillo FAA called Sayre Sheriff&#39;s office, asking about object stated they didn&#39;t know about any meteor&#39;s, but were concerned about a possible downed aircraft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Report submitted by Jim Hickman, UFO Investigator, who is known to our Center.

My wife and I were traveling from Dallas to Abilene, heading West on Interstate 20.  It was near sunset (right at 7:30 p.m.) and my wife said &#34;What&#39;s that!&#34;  I looked up and saw a green colored light moving across the sky.  A vapor trail followed it, but it was much larger than a vapor trail left by an airplane.  A bright light, appearing to be fire, followed the bright green light and led to the vapor trail.  The light traveled from directly in front of our windshield from right to left (North/North East).  When it was not too far from the horizon, it looked as if it split into three or four smaller green lights and then disappeared. The same description was also seen by relatives traveling from Houston who were meeting us in Abilene that same day.<n>

I work as an overnight television broadcast engineer.  I had slept most of the day since I worked the previous overnight. It was 7:20pm CDT.  It was pretty cloudy everywhere except to the southwest, to the horizon.  I could also see Venus clearly.  I had just stepped outside when I saw a moving light to the southwest.  It was about a fist at arms lenghth above the horizon moving north.  There seemed to be a bright spot/point or two on the front of the object and it was leaving a very distinct trail that had a sort of shimmer to it.  I watched the object for about 30 seconds and it probably moved 90 degrees across the sky.  It went behind some clouds, so after the first 10 seconds I would see it, then lose it... until it disappeared for good behind heavy cloud cover to the northwest and north. Maybe because of the trail, I figured that it must have been a plane, (I live near a small airport so I see lots of lights in the sky) but it just didn&#39;t seem right for a plane.  I really thought that it looked like some fireballs that I have seen in the sky and on tv/videos.  I thought that it would start to break up at any moment, but it just never did. This is the best part.  The trail that it left stayed in the sky for another 10-15 minutes.  It must have been high enough to catch the last glint of sunlight because as the sky got darker, the trail went from a shimmer to a glow!  It was like a beam of light, as bright as the full moon, across the southwesten sky.  It really was a sight.  I took some 35mm photos but we&#39;ll see how they turn out. I ain&#39;t Ansel Adams. My wife said it was just &#34;the conditions&#34; that caused it.  OK.  But what is it about &#34;the conditions&#34; that are so different that I keep seeing things in the sky that I have never seen before?<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We are quite grateful for such an informative report.  Interestingly, other reports, including an official statement from a federal agency, have the object moving to the south.  Please see report from Baird, TX, for 1930 hrs. on this date.

To the best of our knowledge, the event had no special Biblical significance, although the Bible is not our specialty here.  PD))<n> <n><n> <n><n> The Book of Yahweh<n> <n><n> <n><n> On Oct 13, 2000 we were keeping the first day of Tabernacles... in fact it was just a very few min. after sundown which begins the day and we looked up in the sky not too high and a vessel traveling at a great speed but putting out a lot of smoke from behind it was spotted.  Within moments it passed almost directly overhead traveling to the North and all of a sudden split up into 4 different parts... almost like an explosion.  One of the Abilene, Texas News crews actually had some footage on this thing but it seems as though it got hushed up pretty quickly.  I know that I would like to know more about it, and in a biblical sense think it&#39;s splitting up into four parts has to do with a prophesy of these end times. In fact the date given may actually be Oct 12th as it was actually the 13th after sundown, but following the Roman Catholic thing... it would have been the 12th until midnight.  The 13th was actually 7 years exactly from the time that the Peace Agreement for Israel was ratified and went into effect... exactly 7 years to the date of this sighting from the time the Peace Agreement was ratified!  Looking at the Peace Treaty... it was active exactly 3 1/2 years, and went out of effect for exactly 3 1/2 years when the sighting occoured!  A time, times and the dividing of a time... found in Revelations and also spoken of by the prophets.  October 13th was the date of the sealing of the Servants of Yahweh and in Revelations it speaks about the four Malakim (known to all the world as angels.. but angels are messangers of Satan and follow Her every command) that are holding back the winds of war so it doesn&#39;t hurt the earth, sea nor any tree... Revelations 7:1-8.  October 13th the servants were sealed and the Malakim were only holding the winds of war back until this sealing. I know this sounds far fetched and like I&#39;ve fallen off my rocker... maybe I have given you too much information that you feel is not relevant?  None the less, all these gods are doing is tresspassing on the earth under the Devil&#39;s control and She has only a short time to bring utter destruction to all mankind.  Her angels are what you find flying around in these space vessels.  The neandrethal man they found and did DNA testing on and found it to have no human DNA was one of these gods... one of the children of Yahweh... at least he created them too.  The vessel we saw that evening that broke up into four parts... right after the sealing of the remenant of the 144,000 the winds of war may have been released. Can you give me further information on what this vessel did after it split apart and where the other parts ended up?  I would not be supprized to hear that one landed at the Vatican to talk with the pope to hurry up and get the destruction under way as soon as possible.  We believe that Satan Herself is a guest in the Vatacan.. delivered by one of the vessels that come out of the comet that came forth from Jupiter somewhere around the exact time that the Peace Treaty went out of effect... 3 1/2 years after it went into effect 7 years ago on October 13th.  One of the vessels went over NM from what I understand and the other over the Vatacan... the city that sits on 7 hills... you can read about this place in Revelations 17:1-18, read it for yourself... remember in verse 9 it talks about this woman who has on her head written:  MYSTERY BABYLON THE GREAT THE MOTHER OF THE HARLOTS AND OF THE ABOMINATIONS OF THE EARTH.... verse 9 says, &#34;And here is the mind which has wisdom:  The seven heads are seven mountains on which the woman sits.  We believe this woman..Satan the Devil now sits there in the Vatacan that sits on seven mountains... Rome is her new home.  She was cast down.. Revelations 12:9 says, &#34;And the great dragon was cast out, that old serpent, called the Devil, and Satan, who DECEIVES THE WHOLE WORLD.  She was cast out into the earth, and her angels were cast out with her.&#34;  Has to do with the dates!  Remember when we had said that transmissions of S.O.S. were comming from Jupiter, and then all of a sudden this comet called....&#34;LEVI&#34; comes out of almost nowhere and bombards Jupiter for 6 days but stopped on Friday before Sundown... which begins the Sabbath.  Hit it with 21 big old rocks and then all of a sudden this other &#34;comet&#34; comes out from ...&#34;behind&#34;  Jupiter and heads directly toward the earth?????  Then this big old block of so called &#34;Ice&#34; explodes a short way out from earth... into two seperate chunks of &#34;ice&#34;????  When&#39;s the last time you saw a chunck of &#34;Exploding Ice????&#34;  Satan is here! my frie nds and sits with the pope who is about to take over the Holy Land.. as prophesied that it would be given to the gentiles. Now then please let us know what ocoured to those four parts of that one vessel that came to earth?  Can, or will you tell me where they ended up... United Nations building, Vatican, Moscow, White House.....????  Where???  Your help would be greatly appreceiated.  Thanks!<n>

My wife and I were traveling West on route 44 in Oklahoma.We had just passed a Military air station minutes before when I noticied a vapor trail coming from the south. It appeared to be traveling at a very high rate of speed. I mentioned to my wife to look and see if she could see the jet plane thinking it was from the base. As the object crossed in front of our windshield I detected that it was not a plane but it was producing a flame with a large vapor trail. As it crossed to the right side of the winshield we could make out with the naked eye that there were approx 2 or 3 smaller objects directly behind it. All were producing flames. As it moved off to our right somewhat we could detect what appeared to be a large rock, you could see the surface of the rock looking object and it was about the size of a large beach ball. The smaller objects were about 8 to 10 inches wide, we could not see any form only the flames and smoke trail from the smaller object. The object continued traversing the sky from south to north till we lost it in the distance.All objects had colors of green and orange and white in the fire ball. While returning from Arizona we stopped at the Alien Museum in Roswell NM. I pointed out to my wife a picture they have on the wall of an asteroid streaking in. It was identicle to what we saw. At the time of the incident I radioed what we had saw on the CB radio but got no response.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  May have been re-entering space debris, but that is a guess.  PD))<n>

When all of the sudden, bright lights from above flashed, and cought our attention. As we looked up towards the sky, we saw a triangular shape aircraft hovering over us and our porch.Then a bright light shined down on us, the heat all around us intensified, and it was very hot. Then the beam of light flickered, and the UFO took off, and in a matter of seconds, it was out of our sight.<n>

It made a sound like a dirigible that I heard before I saw it, very loud, but at the same time muted.It was a fairly high altitude--I would estimate between 5000--8000 ft.It went out of sight, and I thought gee I wish I could see that again. I looked up and a similar object was returning from the direction the first one went.The second one didn&#39;t make as much noise as it headed SW about the same altitude as the first. It crossed paths with a strange-looking white thing that looked like another cylinder only it had stubby, short wings that were nearer the tail than the middle of the craft.It flew ENE-no noise. We have had chemtrail spraying all dayand the white &#34;plane&#34; looked like what I&#39;ve seen before connected with that activity.I am a fifty-one year old artist, a wife, homeowner,college.

Suspect large object &#34;bounced&#34; off the uppermost atmosphere, as it NEVER hit the ground, only traveled across the sky, going from a south westerly direction to the north east. Left a noticeable vapor trail, with vapor spots, where the pieces finally burned up and fizzled. It stayed bright, and towards the north it began to glow dimmer, finally going out.

At first it appeared to be a jet on fire.  The object appeared to be fragmenting.  It left trails of smoke, similar to jet vapor in the sky, easily marking the trail of travel. bright yellow balls with blue and green tails moved slowly across the sky. It was near sunset, but not dark yet.  The objects were visible only until they reached the edge of an approaching cold front, producing strong thunderstorms. As they passed behind the veil of clouds, several glows were visible until the objects reached the horizon.  This was very visible to hundreds of football fans, as we were at a football game with a very open view to the sky.  The object appeared to be very high in the sky, not near the ground as it passed through on an arc.<n>

She was sitting on a fifth floor balcony at work at 6:45 am smoking a cigarette when she saw an orange fireball in the western sky.  no estimation of distance.  The fireball lit up, was stationary at the time...not moving, was huge, then disappeared but left a &#34;vapor trail like an airplane&#34; for a small distance, then fireball appeared again, stationary.  This happened three times...fireball, trail, fireball, trail, fireball, trail, fireball; was heading south.  Then disappeared completely.  She was shaken by the incident.  Was not an airplane or helicopter.  I questioned her at length.  She was very sure of what she saw and she is a very credible witness.  We are aware of the fireball sightings of later that night, but thought it important to include this early sighting for the record.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  The author of the report is correct.

Initially it appeared to be stationary although this may have been due to the angle at which I was viewing it. It then banked to the southwest. The thing that struck me about the object was the conspicuous nature of the craft. It was flying at a low altitude and the lights were so large and luminous. There were five lights and I have never seen any type of aircraft with such large bright lights. The lights were round and they ran along the underside of the craft. It was very quiet and of good size. The moon was full so I am sure it was a single craft. I have seen  ball lightening, rockets, planets, etc, but this is the first time I have seen anything  that struck me as odd. Given the area in which I was traveling I do think it was probably some type of military test craft. Very interesting and the lights really stand out in my mind.<n>

When I first spotted it, it appeared to be stationary but this may have been due to the angle at which I was viewing it. The craft was very quiet and banked to the southwest. Initially I just stared due to the conspicuous nature of the craft,  it had such large luminous lights  running along the underside . There were five lights and they were round.  I have seen  many objects in the sky but never anything I could not identify as a planet, rocket test, etc. The experience was somewhat surreal  as it was very unexpected. However given the area through which I was traveling I expect that it was some kind of military test plane. The lights stand out in my mind due to the fact that I have never seen an aircraft with such large bright lights.<n>

Although they seemed stationary, after just 3 minutes they were on a 10 and 6 position. Then the bottom one blinked out, followed shortly by the top one. Then they reappeared a minute later, and the top one quickly disappeared. The bottom one hovered for about 2 minutes before it became weak so it could only be seen by the naked eye. The camcorder no longer registered the light. Then it started to move to the left, and flew across the horizon. Then a light started blinking on the back, and the camera started to register it again. Then another light appeared above the flashing light before both disappearing for good.<n>

At first glance it appeared to be fireworks but the fireball maintained an altitude of approximately 1000 ft and circled about a minute before breaking up into 2 separate balls that circled and eventually burned out. They were slightly larger than the helicopter that was circling them at a much wider radius. I didn&#39;t hear any reports of &#34;anything wierd&#34; on my mobile scanner. I know that I wasn&#39;t the only one who seen this because this is a heavily populated area and the helicopter was circling it. Maybe it was only fireworks but I have never seen fireworks that lasted that more than a few seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We at first thought the witness might be describing the events that were observed at approximately 1930 hrs.over Texas, Oklahoma, and Kansas.

This make twice now!<n> <n><n> <n><n> At exactly 6:45 pm I went out on my balcony to smoke a cigarette. I looked south in the sky and saw a very simular colored light, to one I have previously reported to this site. It was a reddish/pink colored light, that seemed to fade and brighten. Not Blink! at first the light stayed stationary at about 11 o&#39;clock high. I then went and retrieved my Binoculars to get a clearer look at the object. Sure enough, it was the exact same light that I had seen before. It had 4 seperate bright points. Such as 4 engines would look, positioned at 12 o&#39;clock, 3 o&#39;clock, 6 o&#39;clock and 9 o&#39;clock.  The object then began to move eastward, VERY SLOWLY and it was at this time that I called 911 to see if anyone else had reported it. They informed me that I was not the only one to see it. They had a number of calls about it, and suggested that I call Gateway International Airport. I explained to the operator that if I were to go get my phone book, look up the number to the airport, and call them. The object would surely be gone.  This is what happened to me previously. So, instead, I just kept watching it. I then got a phone call from a friend out in east mesa, she wanted to know if I was also aware of the light in the sky. I said yes. We then kept in contact via the phone all the way through the total sighting. It finally disappeared at about 7:20pm after moving as far east as i60 and Gilbert road. It got real bright, real dim, real bright, etc., etc. Then all of a sudden, It was gone. I truly hope that someone will find out what it is that I have had the luck to view 2 times now.  I did call gateway, and they said they too were looking at it, but had no information pertaining to it&#39;s origin.  THIS WAS SO COOL!   I hope it get&#39;s the attention it surely deserves.<n>

It was only visible for approx. 6 seconds then it was gone. The object looked as though it was reflecting the sunlight. I don&#39;t know who the others were beside me at the time.

The closest town to my home is about 15 miles away. My mother and I were returning home from a trip to town one day. I&#39;ll never forget the date. It was Thursday, October 12, 2000. The day before Friday the 13th. We were in our old station wagon. It was a nice and sunny day. We had gotten behind a big rig. It was quite a ways ahead of us. It reached the place where it was to turn off at. It was a left turn and was having to wait for oncoming traffic to pass. I started to slow down and noticed light reflecting in my eyes. For a second, I thought it was the crack in my windshield. It wasn&#39;t. We didn&#39;t see a u.f.o. It was plain as day. Up in the sky, about 500 feet away, was a flying saucer. Just like the movies. It was solid silver, metallic, and was reflecting the sunlight nicely. It was hovering above the trees, not moving. We couldn&#39;t see any windows or anything like that. I don&#39;t know if it made any sound or not because of my car engine. It was shaped like two metal pie plates stuck together. It was solid silver. After watching it for about half a minute, it was gone. It didn&#39;t fly off. It just vanished. It wasn&#39;t a plane, helicopter, blimp or anything like that. We could SEE it. I&#39;ve seen several odd things in the sky since I&#39;ve moved here, but nothing like this. I think that the government tests experimental aircraft around these parts. There are just too many odd lights in the night sky. Well, sorry to have wrote so much. I just wanted to share this. Thanks<n>

Thank You.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We had moved into our new California home in July of 2000.  Our residence sits close to the top of a hillside community three blocks from a fenced off mountainous area to the north of our residence.  The incident I’m sharing took place three months after we moved in approx around October 11th, 2000. Also I feel I should note that somewhere to the north east of our residence inside the above mentioned wild uninhabited area is an old oil drilling facility that at the time of the incident had been dormant for many years according to local neighbors. Presently there is a local political and social debate taking place regarding the reopening of the drilling facility. I was told that at this time tests and surveys are being conducted up in that previously abandon drilling area. There is activity taking place in the form of helicopters flying in and out of the area at all times of the day and night. I know the oil drilling has not been approved yet so I assume the activity is due to! environmental study or site preparation in the case of a yes vote on its reopening. But in October of 2000 there was no activity in the mountain area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I arrived home late from work on the night in question at approx. 2315 hrs to find my two young children asleep in their respective bedrooms and my wife asleep in our room which is at the very rear of the house. I checked on them and without changing out of my shirt and tie. I went to the living room and began to watch TV. The living room was dark, except for the light of the television. The only lights that were on in the entire house were that of the kitchen located, based on my sitting position in the living room, directly at my one o’clock as well as the laundry room light that is next to the kitchen. The local news was towards the end of its broadcast as the weather and sports reports is what I was able to view. It was then the incident began.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I heard a distinct rustling taking place in the kitchen, like the noise made when one is opening a potato chip bag that had been rolled shut and clipped for a while. The noise caught me off guard because I was the only person awake in the house. From my chair I could look down the hallway to the bedrooms and would have seen if anyone had gotten out of bed and walked to the kitchen. Besides the kids at this age never woke up after falling asleep and if they had stirred awake I would have heard them get out of their beds and they surely would have called out for me or my wife. My view of said hallway was unimpeded and from my sitting position in the living room was directly at my eleven o’clock. My heart raced as I knew none of my family members were actually in the kitchen. I became more alarmed as the rustling lasted a very long five to six seconds. I was in total belief that someone was in our kitchen. The noise was clear, slow and deliberate and there was no doubt that it ! was coming from inside our home and specifically from our kitchen. I was frozen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I blurted out “Who’s up?” for some reason, but there was no answer.  The rustling immediately stopped I assume as a reaction to my verbalization.  I was certain someone was in our home as my senses went wild. My hair on the back of my neck and arms stood up and I felt a burning sensation down my spine. In very stern and aggressive voice I blurted out again, “Who’s up?”  I was frozen in my chair, I prepared for a physical confrontation. I prepared to defend my family.  I thought of securing a weapon and quietly as I sat in my chair took off my belt to use the belt buckle as a striking tool. I slowly began to stand and it was then the electricity to my home turned off.  The TV and both lights in the kitchen and laundry room abruptly turned off.  The house was completely dark and without power. My first thought was that the intruder(s) cut the electricity to aid there activity. I was in full red alert as I was certain I had a home invasion situation on my hands.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I stood and quickly walked to the kitchen belt buckle in hand prepared for a life or death struggle. I planned on grabbing a knife the first chance I had.  The soft moonlight that spilled in from the kitchen window illuminated the kitchen slightly.  As I turned the corner from the living room into the kitchen I saw nothing, no one. I did not hear footsteps of someone retreating away from me or out the laundry room door or to the rear of the house.  I quickly confirmed the laundry room door was shut and locked. I realized I needed to clear the house room by room. Could have the intruder fled down the hallway as I rounded the corner from the living room to the kitchen? Possibly, but not very likely as I would have heard such activity. I armed myself with a knife and a flashlight and went down the hall to clear the rooms. My son’s room was first. He was dead asleep. I looked under his bed and in the closet while keeping an ear out for any noise in the hallway behind me or any othe! r areas of the house I had not yet cleared. I moved onto the next child’s room and found him dead asleep as well. I cleared the room as well with no signs of anything out of the ordinary.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The children’s bathroom is what I cleared next, nothing out of place. Onto the master bathroom witch is connected of course to the master bedroom. The master bath room was clear. As I began to exit the master bathroom I was moving slowly and listening for any noises in the house. I was at the threshold of the master bathroom entering the master bedroom. At the threshold I was approximately 9-10 feet away from the foot of our king size bed that sits directly in the middle of our bedroom. Once again I was 9-10 feet away from the foot of our bed. I was startled by what I saw next. My wife who had been asleep during the entire incident to this point was oddly sitting upright on her side of the bed. I did not notice if she had been sitting up as I entered the master bath seconds prior. Nevertheless she was sitting erect and this caused me to stop my gait immediately. I was now one foot past the master bath threshold standing in my bedroom, once again approximately 9 feet away fro! m the foot of the bed. She then whispered in a perturbed tone “Why were you standing over me?” remaining still I responded, “I just walked in the room, I wasn’t standing over you.” She replied whispering and even more upset, “Someone was standing at the foot of our bed looking down on me, it woke me up, I know what I saw!” My heart raced again as I placed my index finger of my right hand to my lips urging her to be quite. I cleared our bedroom as my wife sat in the bed with the blankets up to her nose. The master bedroom was now clear. The only place the intruder could be is in the last room of the house, the office! I shushed my wife again not having time to share all that had transpired and deliberately set out to clear the office.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I cleared the office in a few seconds finding nothing. I came back to the master bedroom and advised my wife to get up out of bed and to follow me. She tried to turn on a lamp and I advised her that the power was out. She hurriedly followed me as we stopped in to check on each child as we made our way back to the living room. I also cleared all the rooms again as we moved forward through the house. Once in the living room I asked her to describe what she saw at the foot of our bed and she could only convey that it was a tall dark figure and that she thought it was me. I reiterated that I was at no point at the foot of the bed and that I had just then walked into the master bathroom and began to exit said bathroom when I noticed her sitting upright. It was then I was able to describe to her all that had happened to me the past 10 minutes in short but concise detail. She asked several rational questions about the incident and I reconfirmed the points she had inquired about. Sh! e lit a few candles and decided to call the power company to see what was wrong with the power.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I peered through our large living room window and did not notice anything out of the order. The one street lamp that sits on the opposite side of our street, three to four houses east, was on as was the power to the residents across the street as I could see a few porch lights on. I opened the front door and walked out onto our porch. I had a strange heavy feeling on my chest and felt uneasy. I found this to be odd as I had calmed down completely from the earlier night events. As soon as exited our front door I felt anxious and edgy for some reason. I noticed that the power was out on all the residences on our side of the street, the north side as it were. There were no porch lights on our side of the street and that was not the norm.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I came back in the house and told my wife that I was going to take a walk up the street to see if the power to the residences north of us was out. She went ballistic. She told me under no uncertain terms that she did not want me to leave her and the kids alone in the house especially after the events I had told her that transpired minutes earlier. She grabbed my right arm and begged me to stay in the house with her. I would not be denied. It was as if I was compelled to go outside and take a look around. I felt like I was being drawn to investigate the night’s activities further. What happened next was unbelievable.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I walked down my residence walk way and stood in the street for a second or two. There are no sidewalks in our neighborhood so I walked w/b on the street under the cover of the huge 50 year old fichus trees that line the street. I reached the corner which is two houses west of my home. I looked north bound and saw that several porch lights were on telling me that the power was not out in all the residences to our north. I walked north on California street about half a block and a strange eerie feeling came over me again, I felt scared for some reason. I turned around and walked south bound back to my street. I turned left and headed back east bound towards my house. The fichus trees on the block drop theses dark burgundy berry type pods and they were all over the street. If you step on the freshly dropped berries you will inevitably bring them into the home as they stick to the bottom of ones shoes. The berries will stain the carpet as we had found out on a prior occasion. I! was looking down, to avoid stepping on said berries, as I walked back to the house using the faint moon beams that were shining through the fichus trees monstrous branches. My gait could be likened to a person hoping stones as they cross a shallow creek attempting not to get wet. I began to feel slightly more relaxed as I got closer and closer to my house. I glanced up and noted the moon light that was creeping and dancing through the branches and was thankful it was lighting my path on the street. I looked back down careful not to step on the previously described berries when suddenly the entire street was lit up in an extremely bright white light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Initially I stopped walking and was dumbfounded as to where this light was coming from. I looked to my left and right simply taking in the scene that had changed in a second. I then looked up into the trees and observed intense white beams of light piercing through the branches of the trees every chance they could. The light was intense and occasionally I would need to squint because of the brightness. I was frozen as my mind was unable to explain the sudden appearance of the light seemingly out of nowhere. As I continued to peer up at the tree and the light, I could tell that the light source was of course above the trees and was slowly moving in a southerly direction from the mountainside. The light was so bright I couldn’t accurately tell what the height of the light source was or what object or vessel was emitting the light. All I could tell was that it was moving slowly southbound and it was directly over my house now. If I had to estimate the light sources height I wou! ld have to say less than 250- 300 feet. Less than a football field would be my most educated guess.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The light continued to move slowly southbound at what appeared to be approximately 5-7 mph at best. The light was now directly over the middle of the street and the light beams continued to shine through the trees branches down onto the street. I remember looking down at the street again to marvel at the brightness of said light.  I took several steps forward keeping the light source in my vision at all times. I found myself not under the protection of the trees any longer. I was now in open space in the middle of my street almost directly in front of my house. The residence directly across the street does not have a fichus tree in the front yard and this allows an unimpaired view of the sky looking southbound. The light source was now more or less over the house directly across the street from my residence.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was no sound emitting from the slow moving light source. No chopping of blades such as you would hear from a helicopter. There was no jet engine or propulsion noise present. There was no green or red aviation flight lights present as well. The light source was too low to the ground to be any craft I have ever seen. Suddenly the light accelerated forward and parallel to a speed I can only describe 10-15 times faster than that of a meteor racing downward and across the sky heading entering our atmosphere.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The light source travelled an immense length air space in less than one second. If I had to estimate the distance it travelled I would have to say approximately 30-40 miles in the previously described one second of time. At the time of its parallel acceleration not a sound was emitted from the light source, It remained absolutely silent in its forward motion and the light became smaller in size almost instantly. The light source size was that of a grape from the position I continued to observe it from.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then the light source took a vertical trajectory, comparable to a child sliding “up” not down a slide. The light source during this upward trajectory increased speed and was traveling even faster than it had during its initial parallel acceleration. The size of the light source at its last visible observation as it turned upward was now that of a small pea.  Suddenly it was gone, simply disappearing out of sight and, what I believe to be, out of our atmosphere.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was unable to move, I was frozen staring at the area of the sky where the light source once was. My heart was beating fast and loud. I felt sick to my stomach. I had no idea what I had just witnessed but I knew in my heart that there was no way that source of that light was from anything on this earth. The speed was greater than anything we as a civilization can possibly have at our disposal.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I walked up to the front door of my house and my wife opened the door. She had the portable phone to her ear and was on hold with the power company. She slowly removed the phone from her ear dropping it down to her side. She was looking at me with a facial expression of concern. She said “What’s wrong with you, you look like you seen a ghost?” I stared at her without saying a word. She said “Your pale, get in the house, what’s wrong?” My response was “I just saw a UFO. I can’t explain what I just saw.” I asked her if she had seen the light over the house and she advised that she had not and that she had been in the den on hold with the power company. It was then that the power company employee came on the line and advised my wife that there was a small pocket of outage in our area. My wife asked her if she knew why and the operator advised that she wasn’t sure why. My wife asked how long before the power would be back on and the employee stated “We need to find something wro! ng before we can fix it and right now we don’t show any blown transformers or downed power lines.” My wife hung up the phone and not 5-10 seconds later the power came back on causing us to jump. I explained to her what I had observed outside our home and reiterated that when I got to the door on my way back that I looked shaken.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The events depicted above are absolutely true and accurate. I have told a few friends and family members of the facts surrounding the events described above but have neglected to officially report said incident.  I am reporting the incident now so that the occurrence can be documented for possible future reference.<n>

It was a white light, resembling a really bright star.  As we watched, it began to move erratically, up and down, back and forth, and was also blinking red and blue lights.  As we started looking around we noticed 2 more of the same objects, one in the west sky and one directly to the north.  the duration of each object varies from a few minutes to nearly an hour.  They get brighter before they start to blink colors, and then they start to fade and blink out slowly.  On one occasion I saw it eminate somthing like an aura of white light all around it in a large area around the object in a strobing or pulsing fashion.  This sighting is ongoing!!  We see them everynight after it gets dark.  Somtimes they will blink out only to reappear later on in the night and in a different location.  We live north of McClellan AFB and have had aircraft in the sky from there and Sacramento intl. during these sightings to compare to.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with this witness, and she seemed to be quite sincere, and quite certain that she had witnessed something unusual.  We have invited her to check a star chart to establish whether the objects might have been &#34;twinkling&#34; stars.  There was another report from northern California for this date, I believe.

I only saw it for a few seconds but the lights pulsed on and of sysmetrically giving the impression that two lights were moving apart and upwards to roughly 30m apart then moving upwards and together to meet again.  I&#39;m not sure how big the object(s) were but I think it was about twice the size of a large jet.  I wondered what it was, then realised I could have seen a UFO.<n>

My brother and i got up to see what was out side, thinking it was someone being pulled over. But, when we looked out the window we didn&#39;t see anything that could cause the flashing . We figured it was a couple of cops driving by. when we laid back down i noticed after a minute that our window was still flashing. this time when we looked out the window i looked to the east sky toward Seattle, and above the tree line we saw a reddish- green colored diamond, with orange sparks shooting from the four sides. still the only thing that was flashing was our window, no other object outside was flashing.  After a moment of trying to figure out what the light was, i cam to the conclusion it was a ufo and ran down the hall screaming ufo! ufo! to my parents. they brushed us off when they looked outside and saw nothing in the sky.<n>

I was looking up, observing the stars when I observed two bright lights traveling quickly over my head.  I was facing north, and the lights came from behind me and continued north at a extremely high rate of speed.  The two lights were traveling side by side.  I believed them to be shooting stars at first, because they were lights and because of their speed.  However, they did not leave any tails behind them.  BUT, what peaked my interest even more than seeing two traveling side by side, was that the light on the right began to zig, zag back and forth like a snake&#39;s path, but stayed on the same path as the one on the left.  They continued north until the bright lights of the city either obscured them, or they burnt out.<n>

It was about 1/2 an hour after sundown. I was looking to the North and saw something coming south from the north. As it got closer I was able to see what looked like several round globes, white in color, in the shape of a four (4) with the top of the 4 the front and the leg of the 4 at the back. Each globe was approximately 1-2 feet in diameter and spaced about 10 feet apart. It took around 15 globes to make the shape. I only saw the globes because of the lights from the street and houses reflecting off of them. They were obviously attached to the structure of the object as I could the stars blotted out as it passed directly overhead. The &#34;4&#34; shape was only about 100 feet overhead or the light from the street and houses would not have illuminated the globes; the top half of the globes were part of the structure. It was a dark object and emitted no light. It flew in a perfectly straight line following the ridge where the South Seattle Community College is located. It made no sound whatsoever.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am a professional flooring salesperson and business manager.<n>

Just before we reached our house I noticed a bright golden light in the sky.  I looked twice at it because it didn&#39;t look like the normal plane lights I am use to seeing in the area.  On my second look, 2 more lights suddenly appeared diagonally left and upward of the first.  I became very excited and yelled to my husband to stop the car and back up since we had reached our driveway and the trees were now obstructing my view.  He looked at me like I was crazy and refused to go back.  My 12 yr. old daughter didn&#39;t believe me either.  My husband dropped us off at home, he had an errand to run.  My 2 yr. old daughter was asleep so I took her into the house and put her in bed and told my 12 yr. old I was going back out to look for the lights again. I was standing in my back yard looking at the various stars and plane lights through the trees, when my 12 yr. old decided to join me.  I was explaining to her what I had seen when we suddenly noticed a bright light flare up just above the tree line to the south of my home.  We became very excited and then suddenly another flared up diagonally/upward to the left of the first and then another some distance apart to the right of the first at the same level.  They appeared to move very quickly and then disappear, only to reappear in roughly the same positions, minutes later.  I ran into the house to get my video camera, but it was too dark and it couldn&#39;t record the lights.  The lights didn&#39;t return after that.  We were very excited and my daughter said she felt like she was watching T.V. and I said the color of the lights seemed bright yellow/gold and she said she thought they looked more red.  We both said they reminded us of fireworks or flares except they were sustained with no smoke or light trails and absolutely no sound.  We noticed an unusual amount of planes appearing to move toward the area where we had seen the lights and my daughter said the planes had scared the lights away.<n>

I couldn&#39;t go back to sleep, so I went into the kitchen, got a Diet Coke, then went into the livingroom, sat down on the couch, and turned my lamp off. There was a glow that I could see out the window, and my first thought was my daughters house is on fire, her house is located about 100 feet west of my house, with nothing obstructing the view. This is what made me get off the couch and look, and I couldn&#39;t believe what I saw. It was solid orange, with no blinking lights, and my guess is it was about the size of a football field, and it was hovering over my daughters house. It hovered for about three minutes then it was gone.<n>

The images each speak for themselves, except for the last image. It shows something quite different on &#34;Night Shot&#34; IR light, that spans IR light for about 10 feet, that is of course invisable to the human eye. Check out the last IR image because it says alot, and this image preceeded a beautiful low flying light that unknown to me at the time and just noticed was captured on my 8m/m Sony camcorder. I have not yet put this sequence of video freeze images on my tiny site. Of course, If there was a particular picture that you were curious about, ie: if it was  faked or hoaxed etc. and I totally understand, and have no problem with loaning out some of the 8m/m original film cassettes if you were interested to study.I have so much crazy stuff in my video archive. Thankyou in advance for checking it out.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We have visited the site and viewed the photos posted there.  The objects appear to be anomalous and unidentifiable to us.  However, we do not have any specific reason to believe that they definitely are bona fide UFO&#39;s.  One photo has the appearance of being that of a white dove or pigeon with its wings extended and tail spread, as if it could be landing, but that is only an impression.  We are not aware of other dramatic reports from this area for this date.  PD))<n>

Af|12/2/00|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/014/S14477.html|247|ndxe200010| Looking to the direct west, not very high above the horizon, I saw what I first thought to be an airplane, with its lights flashing. After watching it for 20 - 30 minutes I realized that it was barely moving at all. It appeared to be a mixture of red, green and white lights, flashing independent of each other. With binoculars I could more easily see the separate lights flashing. I suppose it could be a planet, but its flashing colors are unlike any of the other planets and stars in the sky. If it is a planet or a star, I would appreciate receiving confirmation that it is. Thank you.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We believe the report describes a celestial body.

10/9/00 18:45|Border|WY|Teardrop|5 to 8 minutes|We saw a big, bright, white teardrop that seemed to rotate/shift its light and a second object seemed to split from this one.|12/2/00|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/014/S14526.html|248|ndxe200010| We saw a big, bright, white teardrop that seemed to rotate/shift its light and a second object seemed to split from this one.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My husband and I were driving west on I-80 from Nebraska into Wyoming at sunset.  We saw a number of vapor trails from planes in the sky in front of us, but there was one large bright white light that didn&#39;t seem to have a trail -- or had a very small one, making it a bit teardrop-shaped, with the thin part of the drop to the left of the main light.  A bit like:   &lt;O   It wasn&#39;t too far above the horizon and at first we thought it might be a planet, but it seemed so large and bright.  We thought it might be Venus because it looked like it might be in a crescent, but decided that it wasn&#39;t.  We then realized that the light was starting brighter on the right and then dimming towards the left -- like it was sliding repeatedly in that direction or like a lighthouse beacon rotating.  It didn&#39;t appear to be moving otherwise, unless it was coming very slowly towards us.  I tried to grab the binoculars, but got our inferior pair and the vibration of the car made it too hard to see well.  When I took the binoculars away from my eyes, I saw there were now 2 objects.  I asked my husband where that other white spot had come from and he didn&#39;t know, but it looked like it had split off of the first.  That second light DID move and it stayed around the first.  As I recall, it came from the right and swerved around in front and down.  And then suddenly they were both gone!  We think it lasted all of 5 to 8 minutes. A little later on, further south and a bit higher (I can&#39;t recall the time or place -- Wyoming, near Cheyenne?).  I think it wasn&#39;t too long after the first two lights disappeared.  We thought it was a star, but seemed (again) quite big and bright.  It, too, was white.  I thought it might be a plane, but it didn&#39;t move like any I&#39;d seen.  It seemed to be moving towards us and it seemed like we might pass it soon, but we never caught up to it.  We couldn&#39;t tell in what direction it was traveling; it might have been just back and forth, very slowly.  It, too, didn&#39;t appear totally round, but was a bit more teardrop-shaped, but the thin part was to the right this time.  This light we saw for about 15 minutes (?) and it eventually disappeared.  We weren&#39;t watching it non-stop, but we certainly didn&#39;t pass it or see it fade in size or brightness as if it went off somewhere.  Any ideas anyone?  A very odd thing, to be sure.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Please see other sighting reports of a red light for this date for several locations in the U. S..  PD))<n>

IT WAS VERY CLOUDY THAT NIGHT, BUT THERE WERE BIG BREAKS IN THE CLOUDS, AND THIS BEAUTIFUL OBJECT DANCED AROUND FOR ME, VERY GRACEFULLY SITTING IN THE SKY, AND THEN EFFORTLESSLY, MOVING IN ABSOLUTELY EVERY DIRECTION, SILENTLY, AND AT TIMES, SUPER FAST. THIS ALL TOOK PLACE FOR ABOUT FIVE MINUTES, WHEN I RAN INSIDE THE HOUSE AND AWOKE MY GIRLFRIEND, AND TOLD HER TO &#34;GET THE F*@K OUT HERE RIGHT NOW. AND CHECK OUT THIS UFO!!&#34; SHE PUT HER GLASSES ON AND WATCHED WITH ME FOR A COUPLE MORE MINUTES, WHEN I RAN BACK INSIDE, GRABBED MY MOBILE PHONE, LOOKED UP THE KSAZ CHANNEL 10 PHONE NUMBER, DIALED IT, RAN BACK OUTSIDE AND CONTINUED TO WATCH THE UFO. MY GIRLFRIEND ALSO GRABBED THE CAMERA AND STARTED SHOOTING PICTURES. I HAVEN&#39;T DEVELOPED THEM YET, BUT I WILL AND EMAIL THEM TO YOU. THAT IS, IF THEY COME OUT O.K. ANYWAY, THE PHONE RANG FOR FIVE MINUTES OR SO AND I GAVE UP. WE JUST SAT THERE FOR ANOTHER 10 MINUTES. AS I LOOKED AT THIS (BY THE WAY, I WAS LOOKING IN A WESTERNLY DIRECTION) I OBSERVED SOME STARS, RULED OUT THE POSSIBILITY OF IT BEING THAT, LOOKED AT A FEW COMMERCIAL PLANES...NOT THAT, NO REFLECTION OF SOMETHING, NO WEATHER BALLOON. I HAVE WATCHED THE SKIES FOR AS LONG I HAVE BEEN ALIVE, THIS WAS A GENUINE HIT. EVERYTHING I HAVE SEEN ON T.V. THAT SHOWS WHAT WERE BELIEVED &#34;REAL&#34; ONES. THIS FIT THAT DESCRIPTION. IT WAS UN-REAL, AND I LOVED EVERY MINUTE OF IT. MY GIRLFRIEND WAS AWED. SHE HAD NEVER SEEN ANYTHING LIKE THAT BEFORE. THE WHOLE TIME WE WATCHED, THERE WERE PLANES FLYING BY, AND IT JUST SAT RIGHT WHERE IT STARTED, JUST MOVING ALL AROUND. AT ONE TIME, WE LOST VIEW OF IT, BUT ANOTHER BREAK IN THE CLOUDS, AND ANOTHER SHOW FOR US!! AND THEN, AFTER A BIG SOLID CLOUD ROLLED OVER, IT DISAPPEARED. MY GIRLFRIEND AND I WENT BACK TO BED, TALKED FOR A COUPLE OF MINUTES,! TRIPPED OUT AND CRASHED. I HAD ALSO CALLED MY BROTHER, BUT HE COULDN&#39;T SEE IT, AND IT WAS RAINING VERY HEAVY BY HIM.<n>

The &#34;bottom&#34; was round and covered in white lights.  With binoculars, it sort of resembled an old Gemini space capsule.  There was a brighter light &#34;on top&#34;.  With the naked eye, it looked like a cluster of flashing lights, some of which were red.  However, whatever it was did not move for at least 30 min.  It was a clear night and there were several stars visible and quite a few planes passing by, so it was obvious it was neither a star nor a plane.  About fifteen minutes after first  sighting the object, it emitted a small, circular &#34;disk&#34; from it, which flashed red and moved very quickly away, it a southwest direction from the main object.  We watched the object for about another 15 minutes, and then it finally started moving very, very slowly until we could no longer see it behind a line of trees..  Our apt. faces north, toward Boone, NC.  Though my husband has seen a UFO before (many years ago over Atlanta, Ga.), I have not and have never believed in them.  Our daughter does not believe in them either.  But I admit, this was unlike anything I have ever seen before in my life.  I do not know what it was, but it was not a star, a plane, or a balloon.<n>

We saw what at first appeared to be about a dozen white balloons that were released and floating across the sky.  As they drifted to the right some of them paired off and I have never seen balloons do that.  My step-son went for a pair of binoculars and returned with the only pair he could find which were a children&#39;s pair which did us no good at all.  By this time four or five of the objects went behind some clouds so we determined they were to big and far away for balloons.  The seven that were left formed into a triangle, a vertical row of three and a vertical row of two and stayed stationary for a few minutes.  I went into the house and got my wife and daughter-in-law.  We all saw the objects stay in the same formation for about another five minutes.  My daughter-in-law went next door to borrow another pair of binoculars and we watched her leave.  When we looked back up the objects were gone and did not reappear.<n>

I drive up a little ways and something catches my attention out of the front left corner of my windshiled.At this time I only saw it for a brief moment.It was a series of lights that formed a circle, the lights were spaced apart evenly. I lost sight of it through some trees and tried to explain it away as a reflection, plane, or strobe light from an airport against something. I pulled up a ways and clearly saw it again, it seemed to be hoovering several hundred feet off of the ground but was moving south at a low speed. i stopped my vehicle right away and turned off my lights and motor and got out. i didnt see it again but i also heard nothing. Not a jet sound or anything. I am 38 years old and have been in the outdoors all of my life, camping, hunting, etc and this is the first time i have ever seen anything i couldnt explain.<n>

IN the middle of the night, I awoke with the need to relieve myself and exited the van through the side sliding door.  I was standing a few steps from the vehicle facing the rear and looking at the stars in a cloudless sky when I thought I detected a light moving to the right of the area at which I was looking.  But when i turneed my attention there, I saw nothing.  I turned to get back into the van when a brilliant, red beam flicked across the corner of my left eye into the front door.  I turned around to see the beam disintegrating, but intact enought to trace it to its source-a light in the same placae I had seen movement before.  Immediately upon the seeing the light, it quickly moved a short distance to the left horizontally and blinked out.  I was struck by the brilliance and richness of the beam as there was something about its aualities that rendered a warm, pleasant feeling deep within.  Unlike my first experience 34 years earlier, it took me a while to &#39;digest&#39; the event before I could return to sleep.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

We were facing east.. We noticed a few shooting stars that night.. There was a bright star in the eastern horizon ..I am guessig that it was venus.. As i lay back in the tubb chatting i saw a section of sky that seemed to be blurred.. This section was just north of that bright star... I tried to clear my eyes,figuring that i had gotten somthing in them.As i did this ,,my friend said what the heck is that!! and pointed to the area just right of the bright star... I clearly saw a boomerang shaped,triangular something.. It was as large as jumbo jet ,,or slightly larger.. There was definately ,more surface area than a jumbo jet.. It was camoflagued in to the sky.. What iam trying to say ,,is that it tookon the darkness of the sky,,with little bright spots to resemble the background of the surrounding stars.. The only other way to describe this is using the movie Predator as an example... I took on its surroundings but the area inside was blurred of fuzzy in respect to the surroundigs.The outer edge was illuminated due to the moon being toward the west behind us..The moon was almost full and the sky was clear .. The glare of the moon illuminated the edges of this thing and showed the boomerang shape clearly... If the moon was not shining in that direction we feel that the object would have been very hard to detect... The object crossed the sky from the northeast moving to the southwest... It was traveling sideways with the point of the triangle pointing to the west... It crossed quickly with out any trace of sound..The time was 1:10 EST ,,the ground wind was out of the west at about 5-8 mph.. Skys were clear ,, visability i would estimate over 20 miles..  The altitude of the object seemed to be around 15000 feet in my estimation.Based upon my experieces in traveling in comercial airplanes ,and skiing large mountains.. I would also estimate that it covered a distance in the sky of approximately 50 miles in that 10 to 12 second of time.. There were no traces of propulsion,,smoke,,vapor,,sound,,or any accompaning objects..The outline was whiteish,,as that of the glare from the moon.. The object was seen clearly without mistake of an aircraft ..It had no ligh! ts..Abou t ten minutes later a commercial aircraft passed in the area traveling north ..I wonder if the pilot saw anything..I told my observation to my friend and she said she saw the same thing exactely.. In no way is this a hoax ,,I found this extremly interesting ,,and hope others saw it also..<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We received a telephoned report from this individual, and we found him to be exceptionally credible.

We tried to catch it.  It looked like lightning at first.  But then we realized it was not.  It was a bright light that flashed from left to right for just a second at a distance of about a football field.  It flashed at a ten minute interval then a 2 minute then 10 then 2 again.  It kept moving around.  It was very low to the ground and was often slightly hidden by a horizontal cloud.  We thought that the cloud might have been a trail like a jet would leave.  There were no clouds in the sky anywhere.  The moon and stars were very bright and it was only 35 degrees out.  So there could not have been any lightning anyway.  We got close to it only once where I got a good look at it without a cloud.  It was an incredibly bright light and was very white.  It was big.  It was long and skinny like a shot of lightning going sideways.  It lit up most of the sky but only for a second like lightning, but it was NOT lightning.  It moved around and we chased it. I can&#39;t think of any other way to explain it because we never saw anything like it before.  There was absolutely no sound, we rolled down our window to try to hear anything.  It was very scary because we could not believe what we were seeing.  We kept trying to figure out what it was.  We wondered if anyone else saw it and what they thought.  Though we were scared we kept following it so we could get an answer, but even when we got close we could not figure it out.  We just looked at each other and said it had to be an alien.  It was not a natural phenomena. We just went home puzzled.<n>

While traveling north it was observed first as a round cluster of about 10 greenish lights way up in the sky. The object appeared to be following the car. As the car moved into less populated areas the &#34;object&#34; swooped closer to the car. The cluster of lights were at the bottom of a distinct disk shape which seemed 100 yards wide. The passengers opened the car windows but heard NO sounds, no engines, nothing.  When one passenger used a cell phone is when the object came closest, and then backed off and flew away.<n>

I have a Penthouse Suite on the 12th Floor. A silver ball appeared with great brightness and then in rapid succession the others came out to join it. They were all the same size and began to dance with each other in a playful manner back and forth; it looked like a tag match. The spheres were perfectly round and the silver brightness against the black sky was not a natural light source in the least, but a powerful bright silver. Did anyone in London, Ontario see what I witnessed?<n>

It didn&#39;t seem to be making any noise. I couldnt Judge its altitude but it was about three times the size of a full moon. It looked very sinister, and very unatural.

I have never made a report before.  I was checking a tree in my back yard and looked up, almost direct overhead, high altitude was a white, but almost opaque but milky, filmy look, when the sun hit it glinted as if hitting bright reflection.  It looked at if something was protruding from the bottom.  I got my field glasses and through the glasses saw 5 cylinders coming from the bottom extending slightly out at the outer sides as if it could be a landing apperatus.  This object hovered for about an hour and a half then started moving slowly to the west where it disappeared around 2:30 to 3pm.  I would have not made this report but my daughter in Kansas mentioned she had heard of new sightings recently in Phoenix and Tucson.  I can&#39;t find any reports although a friend said she heard it mentioned on television that some had seen what I did and they did not know what it was.

Sky was absolutely clear with bright sunshine.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I glanced into the sky and observed a small metallic spherical or disk shaped object moving at what appeared to be fairly high speed to the west or southwest.  The object was at about 30-35 degrees above the horizon and appeared to be about the size of the head of a stick pin held out at arms length.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I observed it to move about an inch and 1/2 if my fingers are held out at arms length.  It also appeared to be rising slightly as it moved.  I blinked and it was gone.  I did not really observe it dissappearing, but I pulled over and scrutinized the sky for about two minutes and did not sight it again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object appeared to be a good distance away from me, but I cannot estimate the distance or altitude.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;m a professional geologist employed by a local county and am trained in various remote sensing techniques.  My job requires that I be very  observant while in the outdoors and that I be able to estimate distances.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;ve always believed that there is something to the UFO phenomenon and I&#39;ve looked nearly all my life for one.  This is the first time that I&#39;ve actually seen something that I could not otherwise explain.  I&#39;ve been initially fooled (and excited) by aircraft and rubber and mylar balloons in the past, but I&#39;ve always been able to identify them as objects of common occurence.  This was entirely different -- I even felt that something unusual was going on, though I can&#39;t put my finger on what that something was.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In any event, I&#39;ll be interested to see if anyone else observed the object and if, in fact, it was identified as an aircraft, balloon, etc.  Thanks<n>

Just a couple of red and white lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I drove the approx. 3/4 mile to the bridge, I caught glimpses of it through the trees until I turned north on a parallel street to Hwy 98, expecting to get a good look at it.

It was two concentric circles of round lights, the whole craft about the size of a nickel at arm&#39;s length, the outer ring was 7 or 8 red lights with an inner ring of 5 or 6 white lights, non-rotating, no movement, no sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I lost sight of it for about 20 - 30 sec. turning west, then north coming up to the bridge, then I looked east down I-10 and it was almost out of sight, moving FAST toward Pensacola.  In 25 sec, it had traveled close to 8 miles, that works out to around 1,200 m.p.h.!  No small feat, and apparently no small plane either.&#34;<n>

THE LIGHT APPEARED TO BE HALOGEN. THE CRAFT THEN TURNED AND CAME OUR WAY. BY THEN I HAD MY BINOCULARS OUT AND HAD GOTTEN THE ATTENTION OF MY WIFE AND A FRIEND. UNDER BINOCULAR MAGNIFICATION THE CRAFT BECAME QUITE DISTINCT TO ME  IT WAS APPROXIMATELY 60 FEET THICK AND 300 FEET IN LENGTH,BLACK,SILENT AND THE PROPULSION SYSTEM WAS A BAR OF BLUE LIGHT ACROSS THE BACK OF THE CRAFT. IMMEDIATELY BEFORE IT WOULD EXOCUTE A CHANGE OF DIRECTION THE BAR WOULD BEGIN TO GLOW INTENSELY LIKE A LARGER BLUE DOT ON THE EXISTING LIGHT STRIP. THE SPOTLIGHTS WERE ARRANGED IN A ROW AT THE UNDERNEATH FRONT PART OF THE CRAFT.THEY LOOKED LIKE THREE GLASS PODS AND LONG-OVAL IN SHAPE. IN THE CENTER BOTTOM THERE WERE FOUR RUNNING LIGHTS; TWO WERE BLUE,AND TWO WERE RED. NOW, BELIEVE IT OR NOT THE SIDE OF THE CRAFT WAS DETAILED WITH A WINDOW AS LONG AS IT WAS ON THE SIDE AND THIS LONG WINDOW WAS LIGHT JUST LIKE AN OFFICE BUILDING AT NIGHT.THROUGH MY BINOCULARS AND NOT DREAMING I CLEARLY SAW APPROXIMATELY 15 TO 20 CREATURES IN BLUE UNIFORMS WALKING ON DECK GOING ABOUT THEIR BUSINESS, DUTIES, WHATEVER.LINDA, THEY WERE NORMAL HUMAN BEINGS IN UNIFORM!

I asked what it was and my husband said it was probably someone spotlighting, perhaps looking for deer. Our housemate said &#34;Is there a road up there? Maybe it&#39;s a cop?&#34; It grew brighter and they went inside. Then it started to rise above the hill. AT this point, it was still just a bright white light. I yelled inside, &#34;you guys? It&#39;s rising and it&#39;s getting brighter.&#34; They were laughing at me and then came out to see. We all just watched it a minute and then it started to change colors. First red, then green, then blue. Then it went bright white again. They ran inside to find some binoculars and it was then it began to fad slowly. Almost like a candle going out when you cover the jar with something. Then it was just the size of all the other stars and then it was gone. This all took about 15 minutes. As for the backgrounds of the observers, I was raised Catholic and an army brat. Grew up mostly in Sierra Vista, AZ. JOined the Army where I met my husband. He grew up in Horseshoe Bend, ID. He was in the service for 8 years, myself for 4. He is a mechanic in Boise, ID. I stay home with our 2 kids. We have been married for 4 and a half years. Our housemate is a guy who works with my husband and needed a place to stay while going through a particularly nasty divorce.<n>

We thought it was Venus at first, though much brighter and larger than we would usually expect. It appeared to have a shadow much like the moon had hence our conclusion that it must be a planet.  It also appeared to be stationary.  However half an hour later when we next looked it had moved to a postion over the moon, more than the moon would have moved in that time and was no longer on the circle line that conjoins the planets and the moon. The sun was setting at the time and a couple of minutes later when we next looked the &#34;star&#34; had almost disappeared as if it was going into the earth&#39;s shadow and disappeared entirely in the next couple of minutes.  Implying that the object was far closer than a planet or the moon.<n>

I remember the time because it was near sunset (hence the colors in the sky)when my husband and i went outside outside in my backyard to take the pictures.  (He took some 35 mm pics that i havent had developed yet.)  Anyhow, I didnt see anything irregular in the sky because I was looking at the clouds not at anything else.  (We were sending pictures to our local weather guy so that he could see what we saw.) I didnt see anything odd in the sky until I looked at the picture.  I took them at all angles, some from a higher distance, (on top of a piece of playground equipment) some from a lower distance.  This picture was taken lower as you can tell from the heighth of the cornfield.  This one is the only one that has this object in it....I showed it to my husband and he thought it was a plane or something of the like, because there is a small airport located not too far from there, but the clouds were so low that no plane would have been flying under them, and I dont know of any diamond shaped planes.<n>

We will recommend to the witness that he attempt to locate other witnesses in his neighborhood.  PD))<n> <n><n> <n><n> An orange and white disc stopped and hoverd about 3 or 4 minutes near my backyard.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was out in the back yard grilling a steak. I saw an orange white light basically shoot down and across the sky and stop dead a hundred or so feet away about 30 to 50 feet above the ground. Well, I have to tell you it was pretty damn startling to say the least. It just kinda hoverd there then would wobble a little and move sideways then hover again. The first thing I thought was did anyone else see this but near as I could tell my nieghbors were all indoors and I was the only one there since I live alone. I really didnt want to move but i thought I gotta get a picture of this. I ran inside and started to grab my polaroid but it was out of film so I had to settle for my digital instead. Its flash is broke but its all I had so I tried anyways. When I got back outside it had apparently move some more and was a bit lower to the ground but not much. I was kinda scared to get any closer so I just snapped a couple pictures right where I was. One of them came out ok I guess so thats the one Im sending. It looked as though it was domed or kinda like a half a donut with some  smaller dome with a point on top of it. It had what looked like smaller lights all the way around it. There wasnt any noise really but it seemed like I heard a very low hum but Im not sure if that was this thing or something from the traffic down the road or not. The lights on it would kinda alternate between yellowish and orange to white now and then. It seemed like it would always wobble before it moved also. It would wobble then shift to the side. When the lights on it were mostly white it looked like it was shiny on the outside like silver or a shiny grey color. I tried to watch it every second it was sitting there doing this stuff. I just couldnt figure out what in the world this thing was. I was going to try getting more pictures of it and started to reset the camera but Im telling you this thing all of a sudden shot straight up! I mean like a rocket except it was like one second it was sitting still and the next it was moving at top! speed o r something. Either the lights on it went out or it just dissapeard becuase I lost sight of it almost immediatly after it went up. Im not really sure what else to put here so I guess this it. Its taken me awhile to convince myself to send this to someone but since I would really like to know just what this was I guess I have no choice. I showed a few friends this pic but I havent really told them the whole story. They thought the pic was &#34;neat&#34; but were more interested in making jokes when I asked them what they thought it looked like to them. Maybe someone else saw the same thing? At least thats what I am hoping. Right now I am not even sure I want to get more involved in this than I am so if I could stay anaonymous for the time being that would be great. I will leave my email address so you can contact me if you need to. Ill try to help out if I can so let me know what else there is if you need it .<n>
10/4/00 17:00|Niles|MI|Triangle|seconds|Cursor shaped objects over SW Michgan|12/2/00|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/014/S14411.html|297|ndxe200010| ((NUFORC Note:  We have not seen any cogent evidence that there is anything unusual about the contrails that appear in the airspace above the U. S..  PD))<n> <n><n> <n><n> Cursor shaped objects over SW Michgan<n> <n><n> <n><n> Over the past week in the skies over SW Michigan we have been subjected to heavy contrail spraying.  This was my reason for watching the sky.  With my binoculars and video camera ready I watched and taped as continuous streams of high flying aircraft left trail after trail in all directions.  There has been a constant sound of distant jet roars in the sky but with no visible craft and this over a fairly rual area. This day though the sound was much louder and followed shortly by the sound of a low level helicopter.  While trying to get the helicopter on my video camera I noticed strange movements from behind the haze of a contrail directly overhead. After several unsuccessful attempts to focus in on the object with the camera I opted for the binoculars.  Looking in the direction of the roars I saw something move across my field of vision so I tracked along with it and could not believe my eyes. My first impression was that it was a bird soaring in a thermal but then it began to move in the sky so fluidly and was then joined by two similar craft and then performed a beautiful aerial display and crossed huge expanses in the sky seemingly accelerating and decelerating at will and turning on a dime. I was just recently at the Chicago Air show and watched the Blue Angels do their stuff and it does&#39;nt even come close to what I witnessed.  My entire world has been rocked by this experience and I cannot seem to let it go as nothing.  My original reason for watching the sky that day was to gather evidence of contails on tape and stumbled upon this with an open mind and have been completly convinced of the existance of something in our skies.  I have some very interesting video that has freaked many people out but without the ability to see it frame by frame I don&#39;t know what I have here.  Many good detectable objects in the sky moving in strange ways but due to distance and speed of the objects focus is less than perfect. Some appeared to be similar to a cursor shape and some disc shaped objects that reflect su! nlight a nd have stealth type obscurity with different positions.  Now that I have seen this and know where to look when you hear the sounds in the sky I have seen this 3 seperate times and I feel that my eyes deceive me.  It is as though the contrais are acting as shield to try to obscure what is happening above. I&#39;m frightened and feel that this was of significance enough to report it here.<n>

I opened the patio door and stood in the thresh hold looking to the eastern sky about a minute later I was in pure shock the object I sean was a v shaped object it was very low and moving slow about 5000 feet and 130 knots. I must explain that I am a pilot and love airplanes I know and can identify almost any air plane ever built. Like I said, this object was a v shaped triangle the front was flat and so was the back the bottom was also vary flat and smooth I could see panel seams on the bottom, there was dim gray lights on all pointing down one light in front and four more on each side going back along the edges no other lights where present  the most eary thing is that there was no sound none.

Then as we watched it just faded into nothing, as if moving farther away.

Then i thought it was a firework or a wise guy shot a flare, but then as it grew you could see an object inside it. By the way it dissapated it wasnt anything that was ignited.

As it came closer we all where in shock and to this moment we still are, and I jamed on the brakes and watched it. It landed on the beach just past the dunes. with an amazing rainbow effect going around underneath the craft. We stayed in the car with the lights off to see what would happen. As we where staring at the objects, the larger one sent something like a red beam on our car. We all screamed and I tried to start the car which would not start. We then tried to open the doors, which would not open. We all where very upset and all of the sudden the lights on us changed to blue.  I felt calming feeling coming over me and heard someone telling me that nothing just happend and that I should leave and never come back. after that, I felt the car drop and we all where bounce around the car. all of us felt the same way that we should get the hell out of there. We have been together for the last few days just talking about this and this is our first attempt to let anyone know about it. We are very scared about saying this and want to keep our identaty from anyone as we are all known most of the people and this might make people think we are crazy<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We have requested reports from the other two witnesses, and illustrations from all of them.

It is not a very crowded area of New York City. It is at Jones Beach on Ocean Parkway, It is not crowded at night as it is just a road that goes along the ocean with no houses or buildings anywhere just road and ocean.<n>

We saw three bright white-yellow glowing spheres moving south-west in a triangular pattern beneath a dark shadowy triangular object. The spheres seemed to move independently of each other and of the dark object above, yet maintained position. The objects seemed only 500-600 ft above us and appeared very large. They moved slowly and completely silent as they passed over us. We watched as they moved at this slow pace for some time. Then instantly it accelerated and seemed to disappear.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

We had seen 3 or 4 meteorites which had left brief ionised trails. As we got out I was explaining the effect when I noticed what looked like a large trail above us. I told her that we must have just missed a big one [The tub is on the &#34;dark side&#34; of the house, that is the side opposite the distant lights of Melbourne, so there was virtually no light pollution]. As I dried myself I was surprised to see the &#34;trail&#34; was still visible, so I walked out to see the end of it, which was behind the house. I saw a light which looked like it was shining a beam {the trail}. As I watched it started moving to the east, accelerating as it went until it dissappeared behind some trees. It was hard to tell how high it was or how fast it moved. I didn&#39;t hear any sound coming from it.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Then the two lights started to lift off at an angle toward the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Description is not inconsistent with landing lights on approaching aircraft, but we do not know what the inidividual witnessed.

I did have a witness who saw the incident with me, but to date we are the only ones I know of. As we stood talking in the front yard of his Orange Park home one Fall evening, the sky was virtually clear with only a few clouds around (few and far between). I noticed something in the sky that at first came to my mind as two birds flying directly over his house reflecting the light from his front porch. I then realized first off that it was not birds, then, that it was not close enough to the house to be reflecting the light. The objects, themselves were no brighter than the stars around them and they left no discernable trail behind them. They flew side by side, then in a uniform move they crossed paths and continued on in the same direction (East to West) and in what seemed to be the same distance apart that they had been before they crossed paths. They continued on in this formation until they were out of sight over my friends rooftop. The whole incident took only a few seconds, but my mind raced to try to explain to my senses exactly what I was observing. To this day I am not at all sure what it was, but as I said my friend and I were the only ones to date to have seen the sight. I thought also in the few seconds of the occurence that it might be shooting stars but, they did not fade from view and the maneuvers were too precise and calculated. If someone could explain what it was that I saw I would appreciate it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

It would then hold its position for 10 or 15 seconds before moving in a straight line upward, where it would hold again, 10 or 15 seconds. Then in would move downward in a arc .  It would continue these movements,  left or right, up or down, in curving arcs, with pauses in betweeen movements. Some up or down movements also traveled at around a 45 degree angle. WE observed this pinpoint of white light 3 nights in a row, well after darkness had set in.  Each night it would be off to the west in the same vicinity but a slightly different spot. It always appeared to be the same size as the stars were.   Two of us are retired , the third is a copy machine repairman. With binoculars a faint reddish glow would appear on the edge<n>

ON the way back in home in the car, i noticed a light in the sky in the distance, it was very small, but it caught my eye as it was right ahead of us.  I said to my mum &#34;Look at that light mum&#34;, and she looked and said somthing like &#34;Must be your gran watching over you&#34;, so then i said &#34;Look at it now its getting closer&#34;, and soon it was about the size of that visable planet you can see from earth (sorry i forget the name), anyway it got closer and closer and mum said &#34;im stopping the car&#34;, just then i lost sight of the object so we both got out the car (by this time we were on a very quiet road).<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object was nowhere in sight.  I searched all over the sky and then realised that it was directly above us, the craft made no noise at all, it had flashing lights, i remember they were green, blue, red all around it.  It was about the size of a small aircraft.  I looked at my mother and she said &#34;Its not making any noise&#34;, I actually panicked as the thing was right above us, (about 30ft) and it was hovering like it was watching us, i told mum to get in the car and we rushed off like crazy.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Just then mum said &#34;OH MY GOD&#34;, i hadnt noticed what had happend as i had been staring ahead keeping my eyes on the road, but mum told me that the object had shot up (straight up) into the sky in a split second and was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I testify that i saw that thing that day and me and my mother would gladly take a lie detector test or anything, our memories are a little hazy now, and we would have told people sooner  (in fact i think my mum did), but who would belive us?<n> <n><n> <n><n> We still hardly believe it sometimes, but we both know it happend.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date is approximate.

I thought that it might crash onto Veirs Mill Road!  It was moving slowly as it crossed the road, which caught my attention, as I&#39;d never seen anything like this before .  I saw 3 white lights on the bottom of the aircraft, no red/yellow/or green lights, just 3 white ones.  The craft looked to be triangle in shape, and not very tall.  it looked like a flat triangular object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> To the west of me (on University Blvd) were 2 radio communication towers.  I watched this aircraft fly slowly towards the 2 towers.  It made a sharp right turn and faced the towers.  There it hovered for a few seconds, as if it was trying to maneuver the craft around the towers.  The aircraft lifted straight up and then flew over the towers.  It then made another sharp right turn (which I didn&#39;t think was possible with modern aircraft) and flew several feet.  It then made another sharp left turn and took off quickly into the night sky.  This all happened within a matter of a few minutes, while I waited for the light to change.  I wanted to get out of my car and ask the folks around me if they saw it too.  But I was dumbstruck by the whole thing, so I didn&#39;t get out and ask anyone.  I did keep pinching myself while watching this and telling myself that I wasn&#39;t dreaming.  After I got home I told my husband about it.  He fully believed what I was telling him because, as he told me, &#34;I know that you don&#39;t believe in aliens and UFOs...so for you to say that you saw something like this, I believe that you did.&#34;  Of course, others thought I was nuts and asked if I had been drinking or was stoned.  I was neither of these things, but I know what I saw.  I&#39;m not saying that it was a spacecraft filled with little green men, but it was something weird.  I brushed it off as some kind of highly-classified aircraft based out of Andrews Airforce Base, which is in the Washington-area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.

I observed a faint star like object moving in darker space (mid-sky) far above, from northern to southern direction at a relatively high speed (almost faster speed as a passing satelite at lower altitude). When I saw it I immediately showed it to my wife. I thought it was a satelite, but as soon as it reached a certain point in sky it stopped. Then I saw that it was lined up with other 2 or 3 faint starts just like it in the sky, making and semi-curved line like a star cluster. At this time for another observer it could seem like another heavenly star cluster since the pattern was not moving. We continued our walk with this in mind that this may be another sighting and whether we should report it, until I found your web site. We figured well nothing we can do about that but to wonder.<n>

The sun had just set so I could tell they were not stars, as there was still plenty of light in the sky. They looked orange in color. They did not flash or dim. They were a constant color of orange. I described to my wife what I was looking at. They were both at the same point in the horizon. The one on the right was stationary, as the one to the left slowly approached it. My wife said it was a plane or helicopter. I stared in awe as the two lights combined into one. That is when I told my wife I was looking at a pair of UFO&#39;s. She tried to see what I was looking at but had to pay attention to the road. I did not look away the whole time. Then, maybe 5-10 seconds later, the lights split up again and the one on the right returned to its original position. It was then that it disapeared for a few seconds, then reappeared for a few moer and then disapeared completely. All the while the one stationary light never even moved or blinked, or anything.

There was a lot of traffic and lots of clouds in the sky. I happen to look up because of the traffic and I saw this thing. It was the darkest black colour i&#39;ve ever seen and this thing was huge. It could have been anywhere from 1 to 3 miles long. It was moving very slowly with no sound, in three dimentional directions. It waited in mid-air and a much smaller round silver object appeared. With some kind of ant sticking out of the front of it. This round silver object looked like some kind of craft not from this planet. The black thing to this day scared my wife so bad. To this day i believed that the black thing was not a craft but something that was actully alive. The reason why I say that the black thing might have been alive is because the way it moved. It was able to move three dimentional and I believe that this thing defenatly wanted to be noticed. I believe with that huge traffic jam other people had to see what we saw. At least some of them. This black thing was so huge and so powerful looking that It could be mistaken for a god. I wanted to pull over to the side of the road but my wife wouldn&#39;t allow me to have a better look at it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.
