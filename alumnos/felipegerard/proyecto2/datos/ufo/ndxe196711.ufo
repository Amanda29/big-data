11/20/67 21:00|Silver Lake|OR|Unknown|1minute|Saw a small white light that increased dramatically in size, reduced to a small light, turned red and zip......it was gone.|8/5/12|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/091/S91179.html|1|ndxe196711| Saw a small white light that increased dramatically in size, reduced to a small light, turned red and zip......it was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> #4.  The time is late fall, 1967.  The girlfriend mentioned in #3 is my wife and we live in Bend, Oregon where I was attending college.  As finances were tight (nothing new for a student) we would many times drive to where my parents were living in Lakeview, Oregon for a weekend getaway at very little cost, other than fuel.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The drive is about 175 miles to the southeast of Bend, Oregon on a two-lane asphalt highway, and for the most part extremely barren and traveled very little after dark. I had classes at Central Oregon Community College until late afternoons and we&#39;d leave Bend about dark for the approximately 3 hour drive.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About halfway through the trip, near Silver Lake, Oregon, which is noted for the long, flat expanses of arid dry desert, I got a chill, as if I was being watched. Since we were in somewhat desolate country with the possibility of deer, cattle or horses using the open rangeland, I kept my driving speeds to between 50 and 55 mph so I could stop if said animals decided to use the road to lie down and take a snooze. As we were driving I noticed a small light at the 1:00 o&#39;clock position and roughly 40 degrees up. Okay, it could be the landing light of any small airplane that the pilot forgot to turn off.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Suddenly the light started getting larger, which at this point I decreased my driving speed so as not to drive off the road while watching the light continue to get even larger.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As the light got larger I slowed even more until I&#39;m almost stopped. Keep in mind that stopping in the road in this area isn&#39;t dangerous as we hadn&#39;t seen a car for over an hour.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The light has grown to a size that I estimated to be about 100 feet in diameter and at a distance of 1-2 miles away. It looked huge. My wife is screaming at me to “get going”.<n> <n><n> <n><n> No way....I want to see this thing! Then it starts getting smaller, until it is back to the original size, turns to a flashing red light, starts moving west, and within a count of 1,2,3....it is over the horizon! And in this flat, open range, that is over 20 miles! GONE....in a couple of seconds! I&#39;m excited. I was delighted to see something like this.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My wife is still cussing at me (which is rare for her to use profanity) but she is scared! We continued the rest of the trip with no more “excitement”. She didn&#39;t say one word to me for the rest of the trip! We arrive at my parents house, she goes directly to bed without speaking to me.....!!! The next morning, she acts as if this didn&#39;t occur! She would NOT admit what we saw! I&#39;ve tried to reason in my mind what we saw. I know that one of the strobe lights on all airplanes is red. Fine! But that doesn&#39;t explain the white light.....growing to a gigantic size.......reducing again to a small white light than to a flashing red light and DISAPPEARING OVER THE HORIZON in a flash! Needless to say, I never heard of any sightings that evening. Even if anyone else in the area had seen it they&#39;d be accused of drinking! I guess this is the reason it took so many years for me to mention any sightings to anyone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I KNOW WHAT I WITNESSED! Can&#39;t explain it, but know what I saw!!! (Note: My wife of that time frame and I are now divorced, but she has NEVER, EVER admitted to what occurred.)<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  One of five reports from the same source, with whom we have spoken on the telephone, on several occasions.  The witness strikes us as being quite sober-minded, and we suspect he is an excellent witness, and quite reliable.  Once his reports are posted to our website, we will provide links to all of his sighting reports.  PD))<n>

11/12/67 21:30|Chicago|IL|Disk|30 - 60 seconds|Saucer shaped, with 2 and a half portholes visible, a red light atop, and it moved away at high speed|9/15/05|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/046/S46171.html|3|ndxe196711| Saucer shaped, with 2 and a half portholes visible, a red light atop, and it moved away at high speed<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was 17, walking my dog on the near west side of Chicago.  I looked up and saw this craft, saucer shaped, moving from the east towards the west.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was definitely curved, because I saw on the side of the craft round, lighted windows/portholes - 2 were fully visible, and the third was partially visible as it curved around the rear section.  Above the domed top was a red light.  It moved slowly as I watched it for maybe 30 seconds to 60 seconds.  Then, it moved rapidly north (very, very quickly) and was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was no audible sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of the event is approximate.

11/10/67 19:00|Highway 71 between Clearmont, Missouri and Maryville, Missou|MO|Unknown|2-3 minutes|Noticed a semi-circular array of white lights with a pulsing middle light.  Observed object in southern sky.  Actually heard propulsion|3/7/98|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/003/S03064.html|5|ndxe196711| Summary : Noticed a semi-circular array of white lights with a pulsing middle light.  Observed object in southern sky.  Actually heard propulsion system activate before ship moved at a terrific speed to the north and west of sighting position.  Too dark and no moonlight to visualize true shape of craft.  The night was very clear and cold. On way to county seat viewed an array of white lights in southern sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Traveling south on Highway 71 toward county seat, Maryville.  I was 19 at the time.  The other two individuals, men, were slightly older.  We noted a group of lights, in the sky to our right, paralleling our movement to the south and east on the highway.  The driver of the car pulled off onto a side road and the three of us stood outside of the car and observed the lights.  Upon first viewing the object it appeared to have 4-5 white lights on the bottom side it.  In the middle of this array was a pulsating light that would gradually change colors from red to orange to yellow to a bluish cast never actually going completely out.  The object was approximately 1/2 mile to our right and was moving to the east slowly.  Elevation was approximately 1/4 mile.  The object kept moving closer, in the air, and then came to a complete stop.  After stopping, in the sky, there was still no sound.  There were no other competing lights or phenomena so there was no distraction.  The highway was exceptionally quiet, no traffic.  As I gazed at the object and was observing the pulsating of the central light I heard an almost imperceptible sound.  Rather like a low pitched moan which seemed to be emitted from the object in the sky.  The object then moved from the point just to the east of us at a terrific speed and was out of sight in a matter of 2-3 seconds.  There was the almost inaudible hum and then the thing moved from a dead stop to the north and west and was gone.  I went into the Air Force the next year and served a year and one day in Vietnam, 70-71.  I have seen many types of jet aircraft and observed them in flight and have never seen such an array of lights, so closely together and the pulsating ability of the one cente one.  I have a college degree in business/technology and a separate technical school degree in electronics and am well read.  I have never anyone else who has seen or observed anything similar to this craft.  There was no sonic boom, when it took off or anything.  I did have corroborating discussio! ns from two other college aged people from two different places that night, though.  One to the south and east noted the same actual light array but, from a farther distance.  The other was from the north and west and noted a similar object hovering in a pasture area near the town of Elmo.  This event has haunted me since.  No one believes me, trully but, I know what I saw.  One of the two other men is now dead.  He drowned and the other guy still lives in the area but, I never see him.  I work for the State of Missouri and have a job of importance and responsibility.  I just thought that I would pass on my story.  I hope that this may dovetail with some other accounts.  Thank you.<n>
11/10/67 08:30|Liverpool (UK/England)||Cylinder|5mins|the object just hovered very close to me with no sound silver and red like a plane with no wings|2/18/01|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/015/S15812.html|6|ndxe196711| the object just hovered very close to me with no sound silver and red like a plane with no wings<n> <n><n> <n><n> I observed this object as I left home on foot to go to school, the object was about75 yards ahead of me it was hovering over a railway track about 20 feet, it had the shape of say an airplane but with no wings and it moved tail first, it was silver in colour only the top the bottom half was red. I stood and watched it for a minute or so then i went in the house to tel my mother and when i came back out it moved away out of sight. I would say the object was about 30 footlong and about 8-10 feet deep, ireally dont know what else to say and don&#39;t know if this shape or color is of any interest but i still cant explain after all these years<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We suspect the witness uses the European-style date.  Hence, the indicated date of the incident is November 10, 1967, not October 11, 1967.  Date is approximate, in any event.  We have altered the date here.  PD))<n>

Several training companies were in morning formation on our company street just before dawn.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A craft of some sort suddenly appeared at one end of the street above our formations.  It was large, more than the width of the 50 foot wide street, but a number of lights on the bottom focused on the troops prevented me from seeing the exact shape of the craft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It moved like a helicopter slowly down the street about 50-100 feet above us but IT MADE NO SOUND.  When it reached the end of the street it just shot away and again made no sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> No official mention was made of the incident and it was never even discussed.<n>

A white light outlined the object.  Inside the tear shape it was black except for three circular white lights; two near the broad end of the tear and one at the pointed end.  There were no stobe lights, no port and starboard directional lights or any other colored  or blinking lights.  It was traveling in an easterly direction with the broad end forward. It was absolutely silent. It was about the size of my fist as viewed with my arm fully extended.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate; witness currently occupies a professional position of employment.  PD))<n>

It was motionless for abt. 20 seconds and then just shot up verticly to abt. 80 degrees instantanously and again was motionless.  It appeared to be way above our atmosphere.  At that time we became frightened and left the area and returned to Vaucouleurs.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>
