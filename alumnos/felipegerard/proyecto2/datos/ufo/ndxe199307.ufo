Looked out the window and said what is that.  About 350 ft away was a MASSIVE ship floating and moving at a crawl speed over the railway line ... we stood on the front step to observe it... it was deadly silent - didn&#39;t make a sound... it was about 100ft off the ground and lit the tracks up brightly... it floated off the course of the tracks at the same speed and went up over the road and a hilled treed area and eventually went out of sight over what would be the lake.  Woke another witness to observe. 3 of us watched craft go out of sight over what would be our treed horizon wich too about 4 min... girlfriend and i jumped in truck and drove to try to find it but it was gone.  I&#39;ll never forget it,,,, it was massive and didn&#39;t make a noise... lights in a constant triangular formation crossing over the craft.. using a train size fo! r scale as i view them often from the same location it would have been 3 or four times the height of a train in height and 4 or 5 cars long - hovered and moved slowly about 100 ft over the tracks seemd to be about 150 ft high as it moved off the area of the tracks.  Was not man made unless someone was flying a silent blimp pimped out in lights at 100ft at 11 or 12 at night.  Course dictated could not be hoax teathered to ground... size of craft was huge to make zero noise.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.

7/21/93 23:30|Xenia|OH|Light|5-6 Minutes|Xenia Ohio. 3 white lights in triangle formation chase car.|5/14/02|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/022/S22675.html|2|ndxe199307| Xenia Ohio. 3 white lights in triangle formation chase car.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My ex-wife and I were sitting in our car in a gravel pull-off next to an old 1-room schoolhouse on a country road just outside of Xenia. She had just picked me up from work and it was about 11:30 PM. We had pulled over for a few minutes to talk  and to switch seats as she said she didn&#39;t feel like driving. While we were talking she pointed out in front of the car and said &#34;Look at that.&#34; There were 3 white lights in a perfect triangle formation straight out ahead of us and just above the tree-tops. The trees are I&#39;d say no more than 1/8th of a mile straight out from our location. At first they looked like very bright stars and other than being in a perfect triangle didn&#39;t look much out of the ordinary. Then the light that was on the lower right of the formation began performing some very radical movements. It would do 2 or 3 short tight loops and then shoot straight up or down and then back into formation. It was one of the strangest things I had ever seen. Very fast movements. This went on for a few moments and then the whole formation began to move slowly in our general direction. My ex-wife was a little scared at this point and I was beginning to feel the same. I decided to start the car and head toward Xenia. I did a U-turn in the road and accelerated heavily. A few seconds later my wife became hysterical and grabbed on to me. She said &#34;Oh my god it&#39;s behind us&#34;. I looked up in the rear-view and there it was. From what I could tell it just looked like a very very bright spotlight with what looked like 2 smaller lights right and left of it. I remember seeing a bit of orange around the edges and a glowing green on the bottom. Thats the best I can describe it. It appeared that it was extremely close behind us. I did notice that the ground ahead of our car was lit up as well. At one point the light seemed to be swinging like a pendulum in an arc while chasing us. I was truly horrified. I didn&#39;t even notice that we had reached the end of the road where it &#34;T&#39;s&#34; into another road. I hit the brakes just a! bout whe n we were passing the stopsign and we went off the road into a large field. The ground was very dry and there wasn&#39;t much of a ditch between the road and the field so I was able to get the car back up onto the road easily. We weren&#39;t hurt and the car had only very minor damage. Once we got back onto the road I noticed the light was gone. It was a very scary thing and my ex-wife still doesn&#39;t like to talk about it. It took her days to recover emotionally from the incident. We told very few people about it, however I did report this to a UFO researcher in Cincinatti sometime in 1999. He sent me an email informing me that my report was one of SEVERAL describing the same type of craft and incident in our area in the summer of 1993. Seems we were not alone in this. If any of you out there have any knowledge of these events I would like to talk to you. j_dog25@mindspring.com From what I could tell the objects made no sound. The light emitted did not look &#34;normal&#34; it was very pure much like L.E.D. light. At first sighting the objects were about the size of normal bright stars in the night sky. The one that appeared close to us in the rear view mirror took up about 1/3 of the rear-view mirror&#39;s area. The car did not seem to be affected by the objects in any way.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

Object must have been very large, since sighting was from about a mile away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On this night there was a full moon out.  I had been fishing on the south shore of O&#39;ahu, at a place called &#34;Black Point&#34;-a luxurious residential area.  It&#39;s only a mile to the east of Diamond Head crater. The sighting was very brief, and I doubted myself for a while, until two black helicopters showed up a few minutes later.  Then I figured that I must have seen something real.  Initially, I was startled by the helicopters because I did not hear or see them until they were directly in front of me at a distance of about two to three hundred hards.  They continued to scan the areas just beyond the fringing reef from Diamond Head to Hanauma bay (a distance of about 10 miles) with strobe type lights pointed at the water.  This went on for about 30 minutes.  Then they left and so did I.<n>
7/20/93 21:30|Maltby (Snohomish, Woodinville)|WA|Diamond|1 minute|Diamond shaped craft, red and green lights on each end of the diamond.|8/5/09|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/070/S70673.html|4|ndxe199307| Diamond shaped craft, red and green lights on each end of the diamond.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am entering this event for information and comparisons to similar such events.  During the summer of 1993 I was attending night school so I could pass the 11th grade. I had just been at a friends house and was driving to night school. It was night and I was day dreaming as I was driving. I happened to look up and see a plane coming from my right hand side in the trees or low to the trees, or what I thought was a plane. You know the typical red and green lights on the wings. The area is rather woodsy but some what populated and is a well traveled road. As I approached the Y intersection which I was going to take a left on I continued to see the lights. At this moment I thought to myself &#34;wow this plane is flying very low&#34;. In the exact moment I was in the Y intersection I looked up through my windshield to see why this plane was flying so low. But to my surprise which then turned into a horror it was no plane.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Description: Diamond shaped craft. One red light and one green light, at opposites ends of the diamond. A visible line through the diamond (from the small part of the diamond). The size was small and probably as big as a semi truck without its trailer (50-75 feet) max and maybe even smaller. Height above the trees, probably no more than 20-40 feet. Approximate tree height was about 30-50 feet. The color was black and when I say black I mean blacker than the night sky which appeared bright compared to the diamond shaped object. The skin of texture of the object looked like the underside of bark when the little worms dig their little trails but more squared off. It had very sharp corners and the thickness of the aircraft was approximately 10 feet.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The moment I acquired the object with my eyes I stepped on the gas. As I was taking a left and the aircraft was coming from my right as I had looked up seen the object and then continued to make the turn. At this moment I was very upset and scared, panicked. So I sped up as fast as I could safely drive and then realized that the object was pacing me but moving away at the same time. Because of the trees and such I could not see the object as I had in the intersection but I could see the lights dimming as I drove down the road. At the next moment I thought that there should be other cars as I was very close to the highway and a second later I saw a car approaching and then the object was to far away to see and it was gone. I was overall visibly shaken from the shock of seeing such an object and the fact that our paths crossed exactly the same time in an intersection. I continued on my way to night school.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))<n>

I noticed far off in the distance an orange light pulsating slowly in the distance.  I couldn&#39;t see it anymore as I walked up the hill, but when I got to the top of the hill I was facing north toward Burlington looking for it again when I looked directly above me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> That&#39;s when i saw a black triangle with lights on each point and a bulge in the middle flying very low (maybe a couple hundred feet or less off the ground), slowly and silently toward Burlington.  It was almost as if I blacked out because by the time I actually &#39;woke up&#39; or realized what I saw, the object was now a large bright white light in the sky still heading toward Burlington.  I watched it for another couple minutes as it was getting further away from me (closer to Burlington) still appearing as a bright white light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then I noticed what were clearly planes (small red blinking lights) moving toward the light.   As the planes got closer the bright light got dimmer then faded out and disappeared.  I&#39;m assuming it was gone because the planes seemed to circle the area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then I ran to my friend&#39;s house to tell her what I saw and we went up to the roof deck (which has a clear view of burlington and lake champlain) and we could see and hear that there were a lot of planes in the sky (maybe helicopters, too).  About 40 minutes later what appeared to be a low shooting star with a green trail behind it flew across the sky.  My friend didn&#39;t see it. I told her what i&#39;d seen and traced the path across the sky with my finger.  When i was pointing out where it had disappeared, it lit up again and shot toward the ground in the form of the shooting star with the green trail.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I didn&#39;t see any mention in the news about it the next day and never heard anyone ever mention any phenomenon that day.  I&#39;ve always wondered if anyone ever saw the same thing.<n>

Hovering over our land [6 acres] facing west was a enormous jetliner object with a brilliant beam about 8-10 feet across coming from directly center under the object but not a constant beam. It was solid under the plane for what looked like 200 feet and then blank sky for about 50 feet and then to the ground about 100 feet. The wings were near the back of the object.  It looked to be scanning our land.  It was enormous covering most of our property and very low.  All of a sudden I thought of our horse, goats, dogs and other animals and put the truck in gear and floored it.  But as soon as I did that the light dissappeared and the object raised slowly up until it was tiny and stopped.  As we drove into the yard and got out and looked up the object moved swiftly forward and then made a tight turn to the north and whoosh it was gone.  I called the sheriff&#39;s office and reported the incidence only to find out numerous sighting of smaller object were reported over Meade Lake (about 20 miles east of us)later that same night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date of sighting is approximate.

I&#39;m sorry, I normaly speak french, so I hope I will be clear in the way for you to undestand.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Two of my friends and me were at my friend&#39;s place and decided to sleep outside in the backyard, on air beds, directly on the grass.  It was a beautiful summer night, no clouds, no wind, and no people awake, in this (little) suburbs of Montreal. At a moment, we were just kiding and laughing, you know, like any young people can do, and suddendly, my friend said to look up in the sky the strange thing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was dark-brown, like a big rock (shape of an egg maybe), with rough appearence, you see? It was completely quiet, and was floating at about 150 meters from the ground. It&#39;s very particular, the way it was going : I don&#39;t think that there was any engine in the object, the propulsion was very weird, like if it was just gently glide, but fast!  I don&#39;t know how to explain it in another way (in french it would be easier). It was going like something floating firmly in a particular way (to the west).<n> <n><n> <n><n> I saw it for 5-10 seconds (don&#39;t know exactly), it finaly disappeared.  Not disappear by gogin further. Disappear like &#34;pop&#34;, one second we see it, one other second we don&#39;t see it.  It was night and there was no lights on the object, so maybe I missed something, but that is what I remember.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I think the object made 100 meters by the moment we observe it before it disappeared. It was going from east to west. Just over us. We all see it (but one of us, now, think it was birds).<n> <n><n> <n><n> What I remember the most about this event, is the strange feeling of &#34;something weird&#34;, you know.  It wasn&#39;t a birds flew, because at the end, those should go scatter, not disappear. A meteor would burn and fall. I don&#39;t know what is was.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thank you!<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD))<n>

Turned off on a dirt side road to see if we could get closer to it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was 11:00 pm and we were going home from a class reunion. We were between Bridgeport and Grand Coulee Wa and had come over a hill and in the distance saw a pulsating bright red light. It was hovering about a hundred feet off of the ground. I saw it first and asked my wife what is was. She said it was an airplane. I replied that it was no airplane. It was just a light about the same color as a red strobe on an airplane but it was not blinking like a strobe light. It was more like a slow pulsating light that would go from dim to bright in a slow pulse. We turned off on an improved dirt road that led towards the object so we could get a closer look at it. It was hovering over a large set of power lines that transmits power from Grand Coulee Dam. It let us get within 200 yards of it, maybe less, and it took off. It stayed at that distance in front of us matching my speed exactly. I sped up as fast as I felt was safe on a dirt road and it would speed up accordingly. We chased it for about three miles trying to get closer to it. It crossed the road and went out over a wheat field away from the road so I stopped at the point that it crossed the road. As soon as I stopped it stopped. I rolled down my window to see if I could hear it making any noises. The only noise that I heard was the sound of crickets. I sat there wondering what to do next as it was just hovering there. My 13 year old daughter was very frightened at this point as we were out in the middle of nowhere with no lights or houses and she had seen movies about alien abductions. I had been out in this area many times before so I new the way the road went. It wound around the back side of where the object was hovering. I thought that if I took off quickly and got around the other side of it that maybe we could see the shape of it as it passed overhead. I started up the car and took off quickly. The object took off at the same time and ended up passing over the road way ahead of me. It evidently was tired of the cat and mouse game at this point and traveled faster than it had before. The last we saw of it it was streaking north at a great rate of speed.<n>
7/15/93 22:00|Moscow|ID|Other|3 minutes|Moscow, ID-Row of 5-6 off white lights moving silently & slowly east to west summer 93.|8/12/08|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/065/S65046.html|10|ndxe199307| Moscow, ID-Row of 5-6 off white lights moving silently &amp; slowly east to west summer 93.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have finally decided to post this sighting after years of debate and finally choosing your site as a safe place to record this information.  Hopefully, others will file their report as well. My friends and I were having a BBQ in the backyard of my friends house during what i remember sometime in July of 1993.  I heard someone say, &#39;look up&#39; and to my amazement I saw a row or a line of 5-6 off white lights, that would change to red, blue, green colors in a non-synchronized way.  This line of lights were closely linked together at roughly 1,000 ft above the Palouse on the edge of Moscow, ID about 1-2 miles from my position moving silently &amp; slowly East to West.  At first, I thought what I was seeing was a very large plane with lights arranged along the wings but then i realized that planes would not be moving so slowly and I also heard no sound whatsoever. We saw a series of ~5-6 lights lined up in an edge straight row at what i would estimate around 1,000 feet above ground. The lights moved in unison, silent and moving slowly from East to West. It also appeared that the line of lights rotated together slightly around on a center axis as the entire object headed West. It had a slight aura and very subtle vibration as it moved over the town of Moscow to the West.  My friends and I saw this but we didn&#39;t contact anyone because we didn&#39;t know who to contact. It is possible that it could of been a military craft but my friends and I saw something very unusual indeed. I hope that this information is somehow useful.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.  PD))<n>

I had just stopped at a traffic light at the intersection of South State Street (alternate Route 113) and Sorghum Mill Road located at Rising Sun.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My son, who was in the car with me, and I both saw an illuminated object that appeared to be close to the ground in the next town of 2 and 1/2 miles distance south on that road.  As the object was located along the road we were traveling, we continued to see it as drove along Alt Route 113.  Before entering the town of Magnolia, it became apparent the object hovered directly above trees in the center of the town.  Alternate Route 113 intersects the town and the Magnolia Fire station is located on the northbound side of alternate Route 113 at the intersection of Walnut Street. The object was hovering directly above trees and houses located behind the Magnolia fire station and along East Walnut Street.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object was round, at least 900 feet in circumference.  The saucer had 3 sections, a dome, a middle section and a bottom section.  The dome-like top , had one large white or off-white light forming the top of the dome.  The center of the saucer had lights of varying colors that were oblong (almost square) in shape, with rounded corners.  These lights were either blinking or the center of the saucer was rotating.  I did not focus on them long enough to determine which.  The bottom  had off-white or light yellow lights that did not seem to blink or move.  The object was no more than 300 feet away from the road in front of the Magnolia fire department.  I did not hear any noise coming from the object and the trees below the object did not seem to be disturbed by any wind.  Just across from the fire station, facing south, there is a water tower.  The unidentified object was directly behind the fire station (facing east) and hovered lower than the water tower.  We were in clear sight of both the object and the water tower and there was absolutely no mistake that we were seeing an object other than the water tower.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I remember saying out loud to myself that I could not be seeing what I was seeing.  I also recall asking my son, who was 10 years old at the time, if he would mind if we stopped and took a closer look.  He seemed calm, but said he was scared and just wanted to go home.  As soon as we got home - about a 5 minute drive further south along blank road, my son asked if we could go back and take another look.  We had not even gotten out of the car yet and I immediately headed back.  The object was no longer there.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD))<n>

During this &#34;initiation&#34;, all of us were bathing in the warm pond, pretty deep in the Hawaiian woods.  I think it was near Hilo, but I&#39;m not sure because we visited many different sites considered sacred to the Hawaiians.  Some of these sites are called Heiaus, or ancient Hawaiian temples. Others in our group probably could give a better description of the events, as I was personally immersed in a process known as rebirthing with the instructor/shaman for what I estimate to be approximately an hour based on what another in our group said, which was prior to this sighting which I witnessed personally for only about 15 minutes.  (Rebirthing is a breathing technique considered to be a &#34;Western version of Eastern Yogic Pranayam.&#34;) Anyway, this rebirthing was done with my eyes closed, and so it was not until I came out of this process that I saw what the others in my group said they were watching for at least an hour.  I looked up into the sky towards the horizon above a mountain and noticed the stars blinking on and off.  I asked what was happening in the sky, or if I was seeing things, and the others laughed at me, saying they had been watching these UFOs for the past hour while I was undergoing this rebirthing process. I saw, over a mountain, a formation of several, I&#39;d saw anywhere between 1 and 7 at any one time, lights that looked like stars.  They sometimes blinked on, and sometimes off.  They sometimes changed colors (blue, red, white, green), and they moved into various formations including a triangle and a square, and sometimes just blended into the sky to appeared to be star constellations (with the exception that the &#34;stars&#34; would turn on and off and occasionally move to different positions). The instructor of the group, whom some consider to be a kahuna (Hawaiian term for &#34;Keeper of the Secret&#34;), told us that the government was working with Grays in that area in that mountain, and that that was a known base.  They told me they knew where that base was (inside the mountain), but it was not wise to go and visit it.  I don&#39;t know if any of that is true, but I just want to give you some background.  Perhaps it seems nuts.  That&#39;s fine. But, I saw what I saw, just as I described.  It was the only encounter I ever had with anything like that, other than seeing a mysterious green light over the ocean at night in Hawaii that seemed to just move across the water and back.  From what I understand, many people have seen this and call it the &#34;green flash.&#34;  Anyway, I was kind of in an high state of mind after this breathing process, and when I saw them everybody laughed at me.  One person laughed, &#34;Peter&#39;s baaaack!&#34;  I pointed up at these &#34;stars&#34; and said, &#34;The stars are disappearing!&#34;  The others just laughed and one of them said, &#34;No kidding.  We&#39;ve been watching them for about an hour!&#34;  I thought it was amusing how they (the UFOs) seemed to be putting on a show for us and I remember exclaiming, &#34;They&#39;re playing with us!&#34;  Anyway, they disappeared from the sky, just blinked out a few minutes later, and that was it. I have to add that our group used no psychotropics as it might seem by such a sighting.  At no time did any of us.  We followed a strict vegetarian (organic) diet, mostly fresh fruit and nuts for the during of the training which lasted several weeks.  We were all of very clear mind and were not delusional by any means. What this was, I don&#39;t pretend to know.  But, I am sure they were not meteorites, nor swamp gas, nor aiplanes, nor helicopters nor anything man made, due to the precision with which they moved, and how swiftly they moved into such precise patterns.  At times, many of the real stars in the sky seemed to just disappear, like they just got blacked out, and then brought back, and there was no cloud cover whatsoever.  It was the clearest night you could imagine.  The whole experience was extremely strange to me, but our group just sort of &#34;went with the flow&#34; and I don&#39;t remember much talk about it afterwards. So, that&#39;s what I saw.  Probably old news being that it was in 1993, but I figured I&#39;d share it just in case others on the island, or elsewhere witnessed anything similar.  If you find that there has been anything similar from others, I&#39;d appreciate a call.  I&#39;ll call you back on my dime.  Thanks, and keep up the great reporting. By the way, I bet that warm pond is the best place to experience ongoing sightings if you just ask a Hawaiian elder to direct you to it.<n>

We were going about our business as usual on the blacktop hill at the school across the street from my house. The weather was perfect.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At any rate, I saw ((name deleted)) eyes get real wide as he looked at the sky. I looked up and what I saw was amazing. I saw what appeared to be a triangular shaped craft of some kind. I can clearly recall that the bottom was bordered with a green glowing light, and there was a large circular orange light right in the middle of the bottom of the craft. So basically, I was looking a a big green-rimmed triangle with a circular orange light in the center.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I first looked at it it seemed like it was quite far away. Like it was  just passing overhead. But to my mixed horrer/awe/excitement as soon as I looked at the damned thing it slowly but surely started coming right at me. It felt as though I were attached to it by some kind of string, and that by looking at it I was pulling it towards me. Like we were magnetically attracted and we had reached the point of no return, and a collision was inevitable. I also had this odd feeling that everything but me and the object had ceased to exist. I mean, everything was still around me, but it was like everything but me and the ship was on pause or something.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As it descended towards me I watched in awe as it just kept coming closer, and closer, and closer. And the closer it came, the bigger I realized it was. Eventually the thing got so low that I thought it would squash me along with 3/4 of my city block. It was truly amazing. It was gigantic, and it came down right over me in the middle of North Minneapolis! I would have expected chaos around me if I had been thinking clearly. I mean, cars should have been pulled over honking, people should have been yelling, etc... But no. Complete calm. And the calm seemed perfectly natural to me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So, when the ship had come so low that i could hit it with a baseball it was like I snapped out of a trance and panic overwhelmed me. I immediately burst towards my front door across the street. Upon my first step was the first time my brother and my friend had entered my awareness since I first spotted the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I don&#39;t actually remember physically running across the street, but that may have been due to pure panic. Anyway, I got to the door with my brother and friend scrambling right behind me. I took one last look up as I darted into the house, and there was nothing there.<n> <n><n> <n><n> An odd side note. My brother only remembers seeing the thing from a very far distance. He remembers a big ass light far up in the sky and that&#39;s about it. ((name deleted)) remembers the thing descending, but he doesn&#39;t remember it getting nearly as close as I do.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

Confused and thinking perhaps a plane had crashed (although like I said, it came down slowly and under control) we proceeded over to the area but found no wreckage and no evidence of anything in the water (ie. lights).  The object didn&#39;t disappear behind the curvature of the earth because there were trees in the distance behind it that it definitely passed in front of, giving us a reference point as to it&#39;s location.  Neither of us had been drinking, we were left totally baffled.  The Elk River is a well traveled river, it has a very deep channel and is used by freighters passing through on their way to Baltimore and is also very close to Aberdeen Military Proving Grounds.  Other residents in the area have stories of strange things they see including odd looking crafts in the s! ky moving at unusually fast speeds (or sometimes just hovering) and doing outrageous maneuvers such as sharp, sudden turns.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date may be approximate.

It was very difficult to estimate the height of the object as it passed above the sea and the forrest. I would still believe that it was about 200-500 meters above sea-level. Many people saw it because we were waiting at the pubblic car-ferry to take os from one island to another in the finnisn (Finland) archpipelago. I am sure it was not an army aircraft (like the F18 Hornet) because of the speed and colors of the object. Later on the same day we contacted the Flight Controll at the airport of Turku in Finland and they told us that similar observations had been made more north in finland during the same time and day. Anyway, they told us that it was &#34;Space-Trash&#34;, I do not know what that means but that´s the explanation they had.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thanks, Mr. Finland<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain anonymous.

My wife and I had tried to have kids the whole time while I was in the service but to no avail.  An Air Force physician had told us that we couldn&#39;t have any kids because my sperm count was too low.  I told him that I had suffered an injury ((deleted)) when I was a child.  He said that this was probably the reason why we couldn&#39;t have any children.<n> <n><n> <n><n> One night in the summer of 1993 I had a nightmare and woke up the next morning in a cold sweat. For some reason I couldn&#39;t recall what I had dreamed and just shook it off.  I noticed a burn or boil ((deleted--in groin.))  A couple of days later I was mowing the grass and noticed three burn marks on the ground.  Each mark was circular and about 2 feet in diameter and blackened.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I then noticed that the three circles formed a perfect triangle with about 30 foot sides. My wife can confirm this.  One of the circles was in close proximity to one of our blue spruce pine trees.  I thought that was peculiar so I grabbed my flashlight and squirmed underneath the tree.  On the trunk I found that the bark was burnt and a couple of small branches had been burned off. There was also some residue on the ground that resembled small chunks of yellow plastic.   This is not the end of the story.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Next month my wife missed her period. We did a home pregnancy test and found out she was pregnant with my daughter **** (Born April 1994).  **** is extraordinary.  She gets straight A&#39;s and has some precognitive abilities.  A very sensitive child.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It&#39;s as though whoever put the burn marks on my privates, fixed whatever damage there was from childhood.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Last year **** came into our bedroom and asked to sleep with us because she was afraid. We said yes and the next morning she said that she woke up in the middle of the night,(she was laying between us), and said that four alien looking creatures were doing something to mommy and daddy.  &#34;Two on daddy&#39;s side and two on mommy&#39;s side.&#34;  She said that she got scared and put the blanket over her head and stayed that way till morning.  She did go on to say that they stepped through a door or portal and it had a bluish haze to it. It wasn&#39;t our bedroom door.  This makes me think that maybe the aliens are traveling through dimensions and not space.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Anyway, you might think that I&#39;m totally wacko by now but I swear on a stack of bibles that this is the truth.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I told my parents about the facts and they laughed at me, so that&#39;s why I dropped the subject.

It had 3 lights on it, and the shape appeared to be triangular.  The lights blinked alternately.  It was zipping around almost twice as fast as I&#39;d ever seen any other aircraft move, and soon it darted behind some trees.  That was the last I saw of it.<n>

First in line stopped and said something to second friend who was also second in line with myself following in rear. Second friend turned to me and said to look up. As I did I saw three objects moving very fast over head. At which point I immediately said, &#34;Those are UFO&#39;s!&#34;<n> <n><n> <n><n> On the night of July 12, 1993, at 11:30PM, myself and two friends left my house in downtown Niagara Falls to travel by foot approximately 6 blocks in a northerly direction. While transiting between two fairly large buildings (4-8 stories) and traveling through a gravel parking lot single file, my first friend turned to my second friend, who was also second in line and said something, all while keeping pace and in step. After about one more step, my second friend, the one second in line, turned to me and said to &#34;look up&#34;, at which point I did. I immediately said, &#34;THOSE ARE UFO&#39;S!.&#34;  I have been involved since my teenage years with aircraft. I used to wash airplanes for rides at the local airport. I&#39;ve had the opportunity to fly in just about any and every type of aircraft imaginable, from hot air balloons over Niagara Falls to flying sailplanes around Pike&#39;s Peak. I have flown in acrobatic biplanes, helicopters and in general I am familiar with most modern and historic aircraft and their flight capabilities. What I and my friends saw at the time of the incident was unlike anything I/we had ever witnessed conventional aircraft do. Both friends have at least some form of familiarity with aircraft simular to my own. When I looked overhead, what I saw was three objects traveling in a northerly heading, from S.W. to N.E. at a relatively high altitude. 5,000 feet + and very fast speed. The speed was very fast for the altitude, as aircraft appear to the eye to move more slowly, the higher the altitude. There was no sound, either direct to ground or doppler effect. The three lights (at the aft portion of craft, as they traveled away) appeared to be a singular circular white glow, with a pink tinge encirling the circle of white light. As we were watching the three lights speed across the night sky, the object on the left, #1, broke off to the left, or west, at about 20 degrees from the other two. Just prior to this break-off, the other two craft, #2 and #3, oscillated in and out in a sort of &#34;bump&#34; manueavor. It was at that point that the #1 craft changed course and started to vere left and upward into the sky. All three objects then began to race upward and outward away from the earth and disappear with one craft on the right, #3 remaining for a moment longer and then too disappeared upward and away from the earth. The two aerodynamic annomalies that struck all of us were the craft&#39;s ability to rapidly move side to side and their upward arc away from the earth, as opposed to following the earth contour, horizon to horizon, as you would expect &#34;normal&#34; aircraft to do. Duration of the incident was about 20-30 seconds.<n>

I stopped playing for a while and rested on the lawn.  As I was laying on my back, I noticed a bright circular/oval shape hovering back and forth over the area.  It was about the size of a nickle hald at arms length; about as high as a helicopter might fly.  As I called my friends over to watch, another craft appeared.  They (the craft) flew overhead and circled one another for about two or three minutes, then stopped momentarily, and shot skyward at a very high speed.  The objects were, as I said, circular and had a bright, but not illuminating, light cast from them.They did not move too quickly before dissapearing. Maybe at a rate of 40 to 45 mph (est.).<n>

One light gained terrific speed and disapeard from sight to return about 0ne minute later only to escort its accompanying light back out of sight. This encounter is like no other I have ever experienced, I thought of all the possibilities eg. remote helicopters (too fast) flares (too bright) aeroplane (monuvering too primitave) birds? (not likely) My experience is special to me, I have told very few others about it and swear that I am telling the truth.<n>

It was behind the trees near my driveway and at first I thought it was an airplane but the light never moved.  When I pulled into the driveway, I saw that the light had moved.  It was now lower in the sky and seemed to be maybe 2 miles to the east of my cabin.  It didn&#39;t move or flash.

I stood in the driveway and watched it for about five minutes.  I went inside and let the dog out and then went to the window to look at the light again.  It had moved again.  It was now north a bit and when I moved my head to get a better view from a different window pane, the light disappeared from view behind an out building.  I went back out into the yard to see it again, but the light was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

This report is being told in all honesty, and even though these two events happened long ago, they have stuck fresh in mind to this day. Here is the report I had given to another organization not too long ago. I was asked in the reporting form to describe the lights if I had seen any, and that is where I started my report at: &#34;There were many round lights and they were all green. They were not blinding and could make out the pattern of the lights as well as the shapes of the lights very well. Object seemed to be round by the way the lights were set up. Green lights were round in shape and the center row seemed to go around the object. Also remember there were more or just one more light near the top of the center row and one near the bottom of the center row of lights.&#34; The next question in the report form I was filling out, asked to give as much information about the sighting as possible: &#34;It was a close sighting and lights were seen well. Object was just below the tops of the trees and behind one set of tree line. I was driving home on a road at night where there are at times very little traffic, sometimes no traffic late at night. A road where there are woods on both sides (Alot pine trees) and not many homes built. I think these woods that go along this long stretch of road (which is Rt. 539) are reserved by the McGuire Air Force Base, since they usually have trucks (hummers, etc) travel to and from these dirt roads that come off of this particular road. It was around the time of 1:30 to 2:15 a.m., was so long ago, do not remember the exact time. I was traveling north on Rt. 539. As I came around one bend I noticed a green light to the left side of the road in the woods near the tops of the trees that were closest to the road, up ahead of me. When I got closer, I slowed down to a crawl, while looking upwards towards the top of the tree line, I eventually stopped the car and rolled down the window. I stared at it in puzzlement. I could see the tree branches silhouetted in front of the many green lights of the round object. This is where the most shock kicked in. After I had stopped the car and was looking at it, I started to realize that this object was actually getting lower and was &#39;very slowly&#39; moving downwards behind the set of trees. I was directly across from the object that was lowering from behind the set of trees. Panic set in and I said to myself **** ****!! Please excuse the language, but it could not be helped. And I slammed my foot onto the gas pedal to leave as quick as possible, I could not drive well, my arms and whole body were shaking. As I was making my way down the road away from where the object was, I looked in my drivers side door mirror, and I saw car headlights coming from around the bend, just before where I was stopped at, and also saw that the object with green lights was no longer there. I did not see the lights any where. Sorry this is so long. And I kept this and another event to myself for so long because I did not know there were so many others seeing u.f.o&#39;s until years later when I started to read up about so many other events that others had witnessed. Never knew of all of the ufo sightings by others until I got a computer and was able to read up on sightings information. This is being told in absolute truth. (I did some searching on the about.com website on ufo sightings for in my state, and found a report posted by another lady who seemed to have seen the same object with all green lights at night in 1996.) 2 years later on another night, the same &#39;exact&#39; object with green lights appeared again in June. In the same area but not in the exact spot, maybe 1 mile further from the first time. This time I was going to head on over to a friends house, I took the same road but heading north this time on rt. 539, but for some reason I decided that maybe I&#39;d go visit my friend another time, and decided to turn off onto another back road to &#39;turn around&#39;. Well this weird feeling came over me, I don&#39;t know why, (I&#39;m in amazement as I write this still now.) As I was slowing down on this other road to get ready to make my u-turn which has no street lights on it, I looked into my passengers side door mirror (I usually had this mirror turned up a little to keep any car&#39;s headlights that were behind me from shining into my eyes), I almost had me heart failure, I caught a glimps of green lights, this time higher in the night sky and the moon was almost full this night. I slowed down on the road and turned my head back to quickly look through the back window of the truck I was driving and was able to see this object better. The object was again stationary in one spot maybe 2 tree lengths up above the tree line. This object and the moon were not that far apart, but also not real close to each other, I remember seeing the moon to the right as I was looking above the trees and the object with green lights farther to the left. Once again, I was the only one on these roads at the time. This time I was thinking &#34;Oh my God, Oh my God, I don&#39;t believe this!&#34; and &#34;It&#39;s back again!!&#34;, and of course panic set in again, and I quickly pulled my vehicle over to the side of the road to make a quick u-turn to go back to the road I had come off of. Which means I was turning around to head some what towards the object, because it was the only way I knew of to get back home. Again, I had slammed on the gas pedal after I made the sharp u-turn and was driving quickly. After I made the u-turn in panic, I got myself to look up (to the left side now, above the trees), and saw no green object, only saw the moon. A second after looking again and not seeing the object I saw car headlights up ahead coming from the road I was heading back to get onto. I made it back home and said to myself, &#39;why when I&#39;m on that road and that thing has to show up are there no other cars around, but when another car was coming around the object would disappear or it&#39;s lights would go out...&#39; I did&#39;nt take that road again for a long time, I changed my route. I would also like to ad, that both times that the object was seen, it was motionless in the sky, completely still, except for the first time where it seemed to start lowering after it was remaining still. There also was no sound whats so ever. Today I am now a professional photographer, I do alot of nature photography, but I wish I was then and wish I had a camera on me during these two events. I would prefer being contacted through email if questions and a follow up were needed, but would consider being contacted by phone as well, even though I would&#39;nt have an easy time at all discussing these two events.<n>

I was directly across from the object that was lowering from behind the set of trees. There was &#39;no&#39; sound that could be heard from the object, and I was pretty close to the object. Panic set in and I said a few words out loud, which I won&#39;t write here. And I slammed my foot onto the gas pedal to leave as quick as possible, I could not drive well, my arms and whole body was shaking. As I was making my way down the road away from where the object was, I looked in my drivers side door mirror, and I saw car headlights coming from around the bend, just before where I was stopped at, and also saw that the object with green lights was no longer there. I did not see the lights any where. Sorry this is so long. And I kept this and another event to myself because I did not know there were so many others seeing u.f.o&#39;s until years later when I started to read up about so many other events that others had witnessed. Never knew of it much until I got a computer and was able to read up on information. I would also like to add that I am in excellent mental health, high IQ, never had done drugs, nor alcohol, nor have ever had hallucinations, and I was not tired that night. This is being told in absolute truth. And would be nice to know if any others had spotted this green lit up object in that area as well. 2 years later on another night, the same &#39;exact&#39; object with green lights appeared again I think in June. In the same area but not in the exact spot, maybe 1 mile further from the first time. This time I was going to head on over to a friends house, I took the same road, but for some reason while driving there I decided that maybe I&#39;d go visit my friend another time, and decided to turn off onto another back road to turn around.  Well this weird feeling came over me, I don&#39;t know why, (I&#39;m in amazement as I write this still now.) As I was slowing down on this other road which has no street lights on it, I looked into my passengers side door mirror, I almost had me heart failure, I caught a glimps of green lights this time much higher in the night sky and the moon was almost fool this night. The object was again stationary in one spot maybe 2 tree lengths up above the tree line. This object and the moon were not that far apart, I remember seeing the moon to the right as I was looking above the trees and the green lit up object farther to the left. Once again, I was the only one on these two roads at the time. This time I was thinking &#34;Oh my God, Oh my God, I don&#39;t believe this&#34; and &#34;It&#39;s back again&#34;, with some curse words, and of course panic set in again, and I quickly pulled my vehicle over to the side of the road to make a quick u-turn to go back to the road I had come off of. Which means I was turning around to head some what towards the object, because it was the only way I knew of to get back home. Again, I had slammed on the gas after I made the sharp u-turn and was driving quickly. After I made the u-turn in panic, I got myself to look up (to the left side now, above the trees), and saw no green object, only saw the moon. A second after looking again and not seeing the object I saw car headlights up ahead coming from the road I was heading back to get onto.  I made it back home, and said to myself, why when I&#39;m on that road and that thing has to show up are there no other cars around, but when ! another car was coming around the object would disappear or it&#39;s lights would go out... I did&#39;nt take that road again for a long time, I changed my route. These days, I am now a professional photographer, but I wish I was then and wish I had a camera on me. I am a 29 Yr. old female. If there are any questions, I can be contacted through email.<n>

I heard a little swish of its wings too but i am sure that it had no wings. The sky was clear that night and stars were shining but when the object flew right over us (around 5 meters high), it blocked the view of the stars for 15 seconds. It was not a bird (owl or bat etc) because we don&#39;t have animals of such a huge diameter. It was really a UFO!<n>

We then saw a large object lift off and explode into light<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am a life-long experiencer of ufo, sleep paralysis, psychic phenomenon. My most incredible sighting happened in 1993, while I was walking with my aunt. We were walking at night in her neighborhood, when a black van pulled up beside us. A man, who I could not clearly see, asked us if we &#34;wanted a ride&#34;. We quickly said no. As we walked on abit, and rounded a corner. We walked in front of her apartment complex, Greentree Apts. Now, across the street, there is a radio station, and a large field behind it where, often is used as a small fairground. My aunt and I were speaking about nothing in particular, when all off a sudden she said, &#34;what is that light over there?&#34; I looked out of the corner of my eye, at somethingt that seemed to be coming up from the field. I said, &#34;oh, that is a helicopter.&#34; &#34;But,&#34; she replied, &#34;it isn&#39;t making any noise.&#34; I quickly realised she was right, and we both suddenly stopped and watched as a dark object with very bright lights at both ends and an occasional lightening flash on top rose, silently, from the field behind the radio station. It went quickly, at a sixty degree angle or arc, until we could almost see under it. Then it exploded into a red flash, and was gone quicker than anything I had ever seen. We were aghast for several minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Now, that is the most incredible thing I have ever seen in the night sky. Since then, I have had many more experiences, discovered spiritualism, and began writing and channeling an entity I call Zem. Recently, i had a sighting on a country road with a member of the psychic development group that I had in college, and, again, there was a BLACK VAN driving toward the object down the road (it seemed to have come out of nowhere), as we drove away from the object (which was a cery bright, flickering object). What I suppose I am most curious about is, actually, what the black van has to do with these objects, and has anyone ever reported it? If so, I would like to know about it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

I thought it might be landing lights of an aircraft, but it just hovered in the air. The shape was disk or saucer shaped, and it appeared in the horizontal orientation- like a flat oval. The light became very bright- like arc welding or a flash of lightning when all of a sudden, the object shot off at the speed of light at I would say about a 45 degree angle. It was much faster than any aircraft known to man. Although it did rise straight up slightly, it definitely was not a Harrier.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I also experienced a loss of time and location. I do not know if the actual date is correct or even the city in which it occurred. I think others may have pulled over on the freeway to see it. I have always accepted the idea of other intelligent life forms in our galaxy or elsewhere in outerspace. The incident only strengthened my belief in UFO&#39;s and extraterrestrials. I have since had a(n) experience(s) that I  thought I was under a very bright, hot light and individuals were examining me and making strange noises. I have also had episodes since then of seeing imagery of everyday scenes when my eyes are shut that appear holigraphic and 3-D. I don&#39;t know what this is, but some tell me it&#39;s called &#34;remote viewing&#34;. This may or may not have anything to do with my UFO sighting, but my guess is it does.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I just wanted to tell everyone about the sighting our family had , I believe it was in 1993 . It was in the summer , the time was 9 or 10 pm , I believe the month was july . We was watching tv and all of a sudden the door came open , it was my brother , he said there was a ufo ! I thought yeah i bet . We all got up and went out side , there was a very big and very bright green ball moving across the sky from east to west , at times a red glow was under the object , and little red objects would move out from the bottom of this red glowing corona . The sighting didn&#39;t last very long as we watched the ufo go behind the trees in the west and as it went behind the trees , we were all watching the skies and all of a sudden a very bright green light shot up from the ground into the air , the light was in the shape of a V , I have never seen anything like this in my life , it was a very bright green and in the shape of a perfect V , and the green light slowly faded away . We were all so amazed at what we had just seen , and were trying to figure out what it could have been , we talked for a minute or so and my mom went it to the house and we went in with her , she got on the phone to call my dad and tell him what we had just seen , she tried dialing the number where he works and a voice came on the line and said (this is an international operator and your call did not go through , and the line went dead, in a few minutes the tone came back , so she tried it again , and the very same thing happened again, she would keep trying , and the same thing would happen , in hour or so the phone started working normal again , We thought we had seen the ufo crash so we got in the car and started driving toward the direction of the bright green flash , we looked for hours but didn&#39;t find anything , so we all went home and went to bed , the kids were a bit scared , but in time all went to sleep. That is my UFO encounter in the summer of 1993 . I am posting this because it was one of the most a! mazing thing i have ever seen in my life , and also to ask others out there if they might have seen the UFO . If you did please let me know . I live in Paragon Indiana .<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

A spherical object  the size of a bowling ball swooped down in front of the windshield from behind and to the right of us, hovered and rotated(or rolled in all directions). The sphere was a melty blue and green metallic object with a luster, and was about the size of a bowling ball.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My best friend and I were returning to So. Cal from a short vacation up north for the 4th of July. At almost half past midnight, Saturday night going into Sunday morning, we were on I-5 almost to the summit of the Tehachapi mountains when a spherical object swooped down from behind and to the right of me (on the passenger side) and stopped directly in front of the drivers side windshield, some 18 inches or so out from the glass. Despite our speed of travel, the rotating sphere appeared to be absolutely still and stationary,except that it was rotating freely in a rolling motion going in all directions. The object was quite beautiful. It reminded me of perhaps a metal globe which had gotten melty, and the continents and oceans were all melting together. It was blue and green, with a luster, but I would not call it shiny, as it did not seem to reflect light the way we normally see a shiny object do. I do not have the English vacabulary to vividly describe what we saw, because we don&#39;t have movement and color exactly like that in everyday life. The sphere stayed  in front of the window for maybe 45-50 seconds and then took off. The take off was really nice to watch. It zipped laterally away from us for a moment, momentarily forming a sort of tail, like an elongated teardrop. It then paused for a second (maybe 50 yards ahead of us) and recollected into a perfect sphere, and then shot off much faster out ond up and was quickly lost from view. Two things awed me about the object; how it was able to exactly match our speed so as to appear suspended, and how we were able to see it so well as it was above the hood of the vehicle (a Toyota 4-Runner) and well out of the range of the headlights. I don&#39;t pretend to know what it was, but it was quite beautiful, and I&#39;m glad to have been able to observe it so closely, that had the windshield been absent, I could have leaned forward and touched it.<n>

We had just left dairy queen and on our way home we were passing what was an empty field at the time,and about 60 yards away and 20 feet up in the air we saw this shiny object shaped like a giant toaster. I told my stepmother to flash her headlights at it and after she did it began moving away slowly with a low hum that you could barely here. All of these years I never stopped thinking about it and figured it could have been a military project from SAC (strategic air command) airforce base in Bellevue, NE, because that was the way it traveled after we flashed our lights at it. But I also wondered why it would have gone to such a residential area when there were so many more empty fields closer to the base.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

I just left home on my way to driving 35 miles to SLC to a radio station(I was a late night DJ and needed to be there by 12:30 am).  When driving eastbound on south end of town, I spotted the 4 described orbs hovering maybe 1000 feet over the Oquirrh mountains (approximately directly over Kennecott Open Mine Copper Pit).  I pulled the car over and assured myself I wasn&#39;t seeing a reflection on the inside of my window.  (I moved to various areas of the window, and also rolled down my window and looked outside, the orbs remained stationary).  Even though this was 4th of July, these were definitely not fireworks, as the tight formation hovering continued for somewhat over a minute.  Then the orbs flew in tight formation in a very horizontal direction to the north, following the mountain range.  Apparently the orbs were either in the mountains or in the Salt Lake Valley, because as they flew northward at an extreme speed, they dissapeared behind the mountain range.  I am unaware of any reports on this, but I was on my way to a radio station and broadcasted my sighting on-air and requested further reports to be called in.  I didn&#39;t receive any comments, so I may have been the only one who saw this.<n>

Any then they way they just seperated &amp; started hoovering &amp; almost like playing over the trees seemed pretty weird to me.  They would start &amp; stop whenever they chose to.

Then i sat down with my little cousin and looked up into the sky, I then saw a light shooting across the sky from west to east then again from north to south then again from east to west.When the lights shot across the sky it never came down towards the ground.

Each had six lights down the side of the craft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was out sky watching with binocular when I saw two lights very high and relativly close together in the sky.  It was a clear night and the visability was excellent.  I got my binoculars on the object traveling north to south first and as I was facing east the object was traveling from left to right in my field of view.  I quickly noticed approximatly 12 white or yellow lights, 6 running down each side of the craft in a V or triangular shape.  I almost could not believe what I was seeing.  There was this V shaped craft that had to be huge considering how high it was.  Without the binoculars I could have easily just passed the lights off as airline traffic.  But the craft were were large enough to easily make out the triangle shape with binoculars. Especially when I began to look at the other craft, which actually still closer to me than the one heading south. The second craft was heading east and was moving directly away from me, giving me a perfect view of the V shape.  And I would have to say that a V is a better discription of the craft than triangular because the craft seemed longer rather than wider.  Each craft proceeded in a slow steady manner and I remembered thinking how can these two ships be flying over OKC and there seemed to be no other planes up and interested in them.  I also thought that two identical craft passing each other the way they were was odd, almost like they were mapping something. I watched the two craft for 4-5 minutes before both were completly gone from view.  I wanted to call someone about the incident but never did.  I did report the sighting some months later to the local MUFON chapter but they never made a report either.<n>

We pulled into the campground around 10 p.m. and proceeded to try to find my parents.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As we were trying to find them, we both noticed a large aircraft over the water near the 28-mile Road Bridge. It was triangle in shape, and very large, maybe 200 ft wide. It had no sound, was maybe 100 ft off of the water, and moved very slow (10-15 mph). There were white lights at each corner of the aircraft, the lights were not particularly bright, nor were they dull. They had a warm fuzzy &#34;glow&#34; about them. As if this wasn&#39;t amazing enough for us, there was what appeared to be lightning bolts shooting out of the front of it. This lightning came in pulses lasting about 5 seconds each, and maybe 10 seconds in-between each.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We watched this for 15 to 20 minutes before we were both so freaked out that we went into town to get a hotel room for the night.

Our elevation was above the 10,000 ft. level in the Sierra Nevada Range.<n> <n><n> <n><n> While not quite asleep around 10 PM I heard a strange &#34;whirring&#34; sound in the sky.  I opened my eyes and looked directly up towards the crystal clear, black and moonless, star filled sky.  This slow moving object flew directly over us.  The object radiated absolutely no light whatsoever.  If it wasn&#39;t for the fact that as it passed over head it blocked out the stars behind it, I would have never seen it.  It moved rather slowly across the sky.  Much slower than a jet would travel.  Its direction of travel was from north to south.  Several seconds later, maybe 30 or so, two jets flew overhead in the same path of travel as the object, as if chasing the object.  I could tell they were jets due to their wing tip lights and that I had served on an aircraft carrier in the US Navy I have had plenty of night sightings of US Aircraft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I could not tell the exact height of the object as it flew overhead, but it must been at least 1,000 feet above us to clear the ridge line that surrounded the lakes.  We were just east of the spine of the Sierras and the elevation at the peak is about 11,000 feet.  The two jets were flying at higher than normal speeds but without their afterburners fired.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It just seemed so weird to see an object fly over and block out the stars behind it in a total blackness.  It must have been rather large for it blocked out the section of the sky as if I held my hand out at arms length and blocked out the stars.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I could not make out the edges of the object but it was more of a diamond shape than any of the other shapes you had listed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> No lights, no openings, nothing other than being its shadow.  Just a slight whirring sound was eminated from the object as it passed overhead.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

The direction was northwest of my location, in northwest Houston.  It was fairly far away, in my estimation around 2 miles.  The object may have been cylindrical in shape, or disk-shaped but on edge.  I believe it to be the latter.  I would estimate its diameter at roughly 200&#39;.  It was gray in color, or maybe a matte silver like brushed steel.  The object was moving northeast (?) at about 400 ft/s, not very fast.  After observing the object in flight for around 10 seconds, I found that I could no longer locate it. I am a college student, 19.  At the time of this event, I was 13, but I never thought to report it until now, despite my interest in UFOs.  My memory may be sketchy concerning some details, but my recollection of the overall event is accurate.<n>

Whitney, CA - 1993<n> <n><n> <n><n> My son, nephew and I were backpacking on the trail that leads up to the series of cottonwood lakes just south of Mt. Whitney, CA.  While hiking on the trail we glanced across the canyon to the opposite ridge line and there was a silver colored round object just hovering above the ridge.  It darted in short bursts in several different directions while we watched it.  It was definately NOT an aircraft I had ever seen before.  It would hover motionless for a few seconds and then burst to the left, hover, then burst to the right, hover, then burst upwards, etc.  Each time it hovered it would sit for a few seconds and then burst.  This went on for several minutes and finally dropped behind the ridgeline of the opposite canyon wall.  It was never seen again after that.<n> <n><n> <n><n> That night I saw something completely different.  That will be in a separate post.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

It remained at rest for five or so seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It suddenly began to move to the south to a two o&#39;clock position covering the 120 degrees of sky in 5 - 7 seconds.  During that time it made two opposite 45 degree abrupt turns before disappearing behind the houses to my southern view.  The whole incident lasted 15 seconds or so.  The color of the object was orange like the orange of the University of Texas and the color remained the same during the entire incident.  This occurred on a Saturday morning but I do not remember which Saturday in July it was.  It appeared to be several miles away and several thousand feet in altitude based on my experience viewing aircraft.  There was no sound associated with the sighting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.  PD))<n>
7/1/93 01:30|Hughson|CA|Rectangle|40min.|Orange beams of light|6/18/03|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/029/S29192.html|44|ndxe199307| I was irrigating forty acres,it was a clear non windy night in July in 93,I was up at the house waiting to turn in the the water into the east end of the grapes,I had about an hour to wait when I looked to the west and saw beams of light fanning over the almond orchard,I didnot think much at first until the lights started fanning over the grapes comeing from about two feet over the trees panning down to about two feet over the vines.At this time I said to my self this must be a sheriff helicopter so I walked around the side of the barn to see where the source was comeing from.From the side of the barn,out of blackness,approximately 200 feet above the ground came the orange beams of light,I couldnot see anything emanating the lights.At this time the beams were about one third the way across the west end of the nad now I knew that this wasn&#39;t normal.I watched the beams comeing at me at about one to two mph.for about one min.when I started to get scared so I went back to the gameroom and looked out the window.After observeding for about two min.I went back around the two the same side of the barn with the same results.So I went back to gameroom and looked out on the event.At this time the five beams were about two thirds across the west twenty and I could see that these were no ordinary beams of lights,for one they were bright orange,two they didnot fan out,they were almost laser like,three,no point of origin.At this time I was scared but entranced so I called my friend to relate what was going on and to go out into his yard to see if he could possibly see anything at his location in Modesto,he said no,I said I would call him back because the first beam was entering the yard,I went and stood at the west side of the barn to see once again if I could see any point of origin just as the first beam struck the barn,to my surprise the beam went threw the wood of the barn(which is solid wood sideing)and the my house to illuminate the neighbors house 100 yards away!I said at this point,good,now the! neighbors will get up and witness these things,but they didn&#39;t.I went back inside the game room to watch,then I said to my self,this will never happen again,get out there so I called my friend back and went outside to describe what was happening.As the first beam came out of the barn I observed that the beam was perfectly cylindric,about five feet in Diameter,bright orange and as it passed over my head it looked as small peaces of paper floating around inside.This was the first of five and I had to go check the levies and this going on.Well haveing no choices I went out to the canal to the east(the same way they were comeing in the barn!) As I drove up on to the canal I looked to the west I could see that the beams were still moveing east at me.The major surprize was to come,as I looked down the canal to the north-west a huge black object,about the size of two football fields moving east also.No lights,no noise.At this point I went back to the road because I was not going under this thing.It was about 1000 yards away from me at the road as it passed in front of me the beams fanned out about 500 feet in front and rear of the object,so as I watched the object the first beams were comeing over my head.I waited until this thing went down the road before I went into the field,and let me tell you I DIDNOT WANT TO GO!Anyway these lights reappeared three months later,no &#34;ship&#34; just lights over my back yard in Delhi Ca.and they were up much higher,about 2000 feet but cars on hiway 99 were stopping on the side to look at them.At this time there was ten spikes of light.I see these things about three times a year and it&#39;s only one at a time,I wish to know of anyone else has seen things,I wish I had called the police on the first time and had a witness to my story.I tried to write Siteing show but no response. This is the first time I ever reported this to a program such as yours.Thank-you.---((initial deleted))<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We have requested that the witness have the neighbor whom he called also submit a report.

I peeked through my blinds and saw a red light through the trees.  I went to my deck where I could see unobstructed and the red light was about 100 yards high.  It was a light that looked like a ruby with light coming through it.  It moved 2-3 degrees left and then right and then it disappeared.
