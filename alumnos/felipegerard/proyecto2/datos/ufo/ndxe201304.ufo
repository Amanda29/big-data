4/30/13 23:10|Carteret|NJ|Triangle|2 minutes|Craft still in sky in same position as 1 hour ago.  ((NUFORC Note:  Possible star??  PD))|5/15/13|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/097/S97485.html|1|ndxe201304| Craft still in sky in same position as 1 hour ago.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It is now 23:16 EST.  I just submitted a report about 5 minutes ago and decided to go back outside to see if the craft is still there - it is!<n> <n><n> <n><n> Clouds have moved, other stars are no longer visible.  This craft is in the same exact spot in the sky as it was when first noticed at approximately 22:20.  The lights continued to twinkle in a triagle formation. Hard to to discount this fact.  If a star or non-craft it should have moved away as the earth is rotating. Still there 1 hour later.  Noteworthy.  Unable to take photo - too far away.<n>
4/30/13 22:28|Carteret|NJ|Triangle|20 minutes|Large triangle object with rotating colored lights, motionless.|5/15/13|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/097/S97484.html|2|ndxe201304| Large triangle object with rotating colored lights, motionless.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Tonight at 22:28 I stepped outside for a moment and immediately observed an interesting ‘star?’ Stood out from the rest of the stars, and had the most unusual multi color twinkle.  I knew it was not a star as the clear color rotation, of blue pink &amp; white, were sequenced, not random. First thought, hm.. maybe the ISS,  which I have seen before, does not have pink lights.  I immediately went inside to obtain a pair of binoculars, and began to view this object.  This ‘object’ remained motionless – not moving – for at least 20 minutes. The colors rotated pink, blue, white (repeated) constantly every second.  Again not random sparkle, but mechanical repetitive.  I view aircraft in the sky often, being so close to Newark Int’l air.  The craft colors were definitely not standard.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This ‘object’ was about 40,000 miles high and did not move.  It was in the Northern Sky.  Below, and nearby, is Newark Int’l airport.  I counted at least 3 planes taking off , ascending and heading in a Southwest direction.  This ‘star’ was above it and easy to hedge a height as the plane passed underneath.  I also thought, if I can see on the ground, the pilots would be able to see also as it was in their view during ascension.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Through the binoculars, I watched for a good ten minutes.  While hard to see, the lights detailed a triangle craft.  Again the three color lights pulsated (one full cycle per second) were at each point.  It never moved.  By 22:50 I decided to return in side and compose this report.  My thoughts – no question a ‘vessel’, not a star.  Man/alien made, due to lights, not a star.  Not the ISS, as have seen before.   Did not move, no average craft can sustain position at great height.  Large.  Wondered what it was waiting for?  Did not feel threatened, as it was very far away.<n>
4/30/13 22:00|Bastrop|TX|Formation||Three dark low flying objects, no lights, no sound, illuminated by the city lights of Bastrop, Tx.|5/15/13|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/097/S97493.html|3|ndxe201304| Three dark low flying objects, no lights, no sound, illuminated by the city lights of Bastrop, Tx.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had just gotten out of my car and was going into work when I noticed three objects in the sky flying in a formation (in a row).  I thought they were large birds, but as the objects went over the building I could see they weren&#39;t.  They didn&#39;t have any visible lights and were relatively low because the city lights were shining off them and that&#39;s why I could see them.  They appeared dark gray in color and shaped somewhat like a plane but they didn&#39;t make a sound as they went over.  They were moving to the North West.<n>
4/30/13 21:40|Smithton|MO|Triangle|60 minutes|Hovering Triangles and Lights in Smithton|5/15/13|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/097/S97488.html|4|ndxe201304| Hovering Triangles and Lights in Smithton<n> <n><n> <n><n> Tonight my husband and I were sitting on the front porch. We can hear a roaring but sounds very low.  He says to look at the three planes flying above us. I get up and look and they get closer and closer.  Turns out it was not planes at all; it was a set of 3 triangular shaped objects.  They stopped and hovered over the house then took off. I watched them go behind the church which is across the street.   I went to look for it with no success. Then, as me and my girls were walking back from trying to find the objects, we see ahead in the trees a big green flash.  We start running towards the object and it hovers above us and it is simply two round lights that changed from green to white.  The craft was probably about 50 ft above us and we could see it clear.  Then, it takes off as if it flew away.  This was not the end however. Next, we saw several more triangle shapes flying above the house.  Then, a huge fireball falls out of the sky and heads toward the neighbors house.  After this, another triangle shape is hovering above the street light.  We walk to it to see if we can figure it out ..keep in mind this is my husband, daughters, and neighbor girls.  As we get closer this triangle shape is just a little above the street light it comes closer and hovers over us and it had red lights around it.  As we got closer it started coming down toward us and a white light lit up. We all got scared and ran off back to the house.  Then the three triangle shapes flew back over the house again and did a circle in the sky and darted off.  I know this story sounds out there, but there were plenty of witnesses.  I felt like I needed to call someone, just not sure who or where to turn.  Thanks for reading!<n>

They had red &amp; White lights. They hovered in place to my NE 40-45 degrees.  NO SOUND.  Stayed in place...tried getting Son by the time he came out of the shower they just slipped off into the black night.  Felt NO fear...just very curious.<n>

The light stopped, then veered to the right, stopped, then left and back down, etc... for approximately 8 minutes, then shot up into the sky until we couldn&#39;t see it anymore (cloudy night).  Then, approximately 3 minutes later it reappeared further south in the sky, did similar movements, then dropped out of sight towards the Earth (trees got in the way and we couldn&#39;t see it anymore).  Perhaps it was a coast guard helicopter maybe?  Appeared far too high and too bright to be a remote-controlled craft.  Too cloudy to have been a satellite I think and definitely didn&#39;t move like any airplane I&#39;ve ever read about.<n>
4/30/13 09:30|Cambridge|MN|Triangle|10 minutes|There were triangle shaped amber lights hovering over the trees.|5/15/13|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/097/S97576.html|7|ndxe201304| There were triangle shaped amber lights hovering over the trees<n> <n><n> <n><n> On 4/30/2013 at 9:30pm, my husband, daughter and I were driving home from bingo.  When we were a few miles from our house we saw two sets of red lights with an amber colored light blinking. as we passed by them, they seemed to be hovering above our neighbors back yard, about three tree lengths into the sky.  it appeared to be two triangular objects with a row of lights on the end, two red on each end with the blinking orange amber in the middle. there was no sound, they weren&#39;t moving, but just &amp;quot;hanging&amp;quot; there.  This is only right down the road from where we live, and we have never seen anything like this.  My husband said they MUST have put up a couple of towers for something, as way too low to be aircraft, and weren&#39;t moving at all.  I said if there were towers they would have to be in someone&#39;s yard, that&#39;s how close they were!  When daylight came, we drove down there and there is no tower, nothing.  We also went back the next two nights and nothing, no lights, nothing but starry sky!<n>

At first I thought it was a helicopter but could not see the shape of the craft, only a light.  The light was constant and not blinking but slightly changing colors.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After about 15 seconds the light faded and vanished after it passed over the top of my car.  I rolled down my window to listen for any sound of an aircraft but heard nothing.  The object was to low and slow to be a satellite or a meteor.  I estimate the object to be at an altitude of 1 thousand to 2 thousand feet off the ground.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I arrived at work, I told a coworker and he said he witnessed the same object.<n>
4/29/13 22:00|Viola|KS|Cross|~5 minutes|Gold, yellowish light, extremely loud, visually NOT an airplane.|5/15/13|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/097/S97476.html|10|ndxe201304| Gold, yellowish light, extremely loud, visually NOT an airplane.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I arrived home and pulled in the drive around 10:00 like I do every night, I parked in the driveway facing west.  When I looked to my left (south) I seen and unfamiliar light that isn’t normally there, it took me a second to figure out what it might be.  The first thing that came to mind was a plane, but it didn’t feel right because I didn’t see the red and green lights, no strobe at the time, and the “headlights” were an odd gold, orange, yellowish color, I pulled my phone out of my pocket to record what I believed to be an UFO sighting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In the video, (viewer discretion advised), I tried to explain what I was seeing but it was the most unexplainable thing I’ve ever seen.  When it came closer it moved in a direct straight path, maybe a mile or two over my head.  As it came across the sky it turns a white strobe light on and it seemed like it was trying to mimic a plane and it looked very similar to an F-86 Fighter Jet (Google).  It had curved wings and colorful, yet unexplainable lights that squared across the inside of the wing-span, the object was extremely loud and there were no other planes or helicopters around.  As it flew away it started to look more and more like a plane but the headlights were red.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Later the same night after the incident I witnessed I looked up to the sky to see if I could see anything else, being in awe.  I had seen a white flickering light that appeared to be a star, until my uncle and I see it make some circular motions and seen red flickers (3-5) around the “star”.  Then I had seen another gold, orange, yellowish light without a strobe coming from the south heading north, the lights kind of shifted and it flew away heading east.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What I had seen on 4-29-13 was unexplainable beyond belief, what my story tells may not be believable to some. Seeing is believing, I believe in what I saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have the video upon request.<n>

I continued to watch and about thirty seconds or so later, I observed another brief flash once again and whatever it was had moved slightly in a horizontal manner.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In all, there were four small irregular flashes from the star-like object over several minutes, and then no more. The event happened a short way below the Big Dipper, and the object appeared to be travelling northwest to southeast.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was no noise.  The light seemed brighter than the ones on the planes that flew by in the same spot about five minutes later, and I could also clearly hear their engine noises.  I also observed three small meteors and a dim sattelite flying over later, so I had just about every familiar airborne object to compare it to.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Conditions were a warm Spring evening with slightly high level haze and virtually no wind after sunset.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Mercey Hot Springs is located approximately 34 miles from the nearest town so there is no artificial light to interfere with sky watching, and the moon didn&#39;t rise until about four hours later.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((ADDENDUM FROM WITNESS))<n> <n><n> <n><n> Hi, Peter. I just submitted another report a few minutes ago regarding Mercey Hot Springs/Firebaugh, CA.  The correct date should be 4/29/2013.  Not sure if I put the correct one.

We were observing the thunderstorm approaching us.  My wife was taking pictures of the dark clouds when we heard a plane flying low.  We were looking at the plane flying over the houses.  As it was flying in one direction, we noticed a light come out of the clouds in front of the plane.  As the plane veered to the left, we kept watching the light come closer towards us.  As it flew over our house, it looked like a fireball with a red haze behind it.  That is when my wife took pictures of it in the sky.  We were able to take three pictures of it.  As it passed our house it disappeared in the clouds.<n>

It was continuous and never changed tones or pitches.  It was so loud that the instant I was awakened, I covered my ears.  I had a hard time even moving because it was so loud.  I did not open my eyes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This loud noise continued for about 1-2 minutes straight.  I feel like I saw a flash of bright light, maybe white or yellow in color right as the noise began; however I cannot confirm the color as I did not open my eyes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then it sounded like whatever was creating the noise drove/flew/etc away but still making the continuous shrieking sound but it got fainter and fainter as it went further and further away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My bedroom is on the 3rd floor of my condo and my bed is positioned exactly the same height as the window.  My head is right in front of the window.  I always keep my window opened.  The sound that I heard felt like it was literally right outside of my window.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have a house ! and fire alarm; however this sound was not either of those.  It was a sound I have never heard before and still have not heard since then.  I don’t remember anything past this point but woke up the next morning with a very strange almost nauseating feeling.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The next morning, I asked my sisters if they heard that loud shrieking noise and they both said “no”.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I don’t know what it was but it was the most unusual and strange feeling and sound I have ever experienced.<n>

This continued for around 7 to 10 seconds and they streaked southward and disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They left a trail like a shooting star at first as they entered the atmosphere, yet there was no trail when they were &amp;quot;playing&amp;quot;.<n>

I could not quite tell, but there appeared to be some odd non-aviation related flashing lights as well.  There were two objects that moved slowly to the north and maybe slightly to the east.  I grew up around aviation and the slow, low movement was not that of an airplane or even that of a recognizable helicopter.  Before I realized it, they were gone.  Cloud cover was several miles to the southeast and would not have factored in their disappearance.  After checking current flights in the air, I determined they were not licensed aircraft with flight plans.  This was an event that I could not explain.<n>

An unusually bright element at the top of my peripheral vision caught my attention, and I looked upward approaching 70 degrees of elevation.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Time: 6-15 seconds.  The bright element’s apparent motion or change in relative sky position made it appear to be descending as the intensity of the brightness increased.  The color of light being emitted was initially brilliant yellow and was shifting to a yellow-orange.  Angle of elevation declining to 60 degrees.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Time: 16-25 seconds.  As the color continued to become full orange and shifting to reddish-orange, the very bright element was slowly traversing the sky in what appeared to be a southerly direction.  Angle of elevation declined to 45 degrees.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Time: 26-30 seconds. I took a few steps back along the patio, knocked of the glass door and motioned to my housemate to join me out back, and gestured toward the sky.  The element’s color was shifting to bright red by this time.  Angel of elevation declining to 35 degrees  Time: 31-40 seconds. The bright element maintained a bright red, retained a vertical angular elevation of approximately 30 degrees.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Time: 41-50 seconds. The two of us then watch the bright element hang in the sky, potentially moving further away south from us, as the color shifted from bright red to brilliant but darker cherry red, though it was fading in intensity.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Time: 51-60 seconds.  The two of us watched to element fade to nothing as the apparent sky location/direct progressed further south.<n> <n><n> <n><n> All the movements of the element appeared to be slow, never jerking inconsistent or rapidly changing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There were no audio abnormalities or sounds that would be consistent with an airplane, helicopter or other known aerial object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Several mornings previously, before dawn, I had observed a meteor or fireball traverse the sky to my southeast, in a west to east direction, with a total duration of 2-3 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The element that is the subject of this report, had no commonalities with a meteor or fireball.<n>

They just flew over my house in a formation of 12 and with no noise and they were lit up each with a very pale and faded orange glowing light.  When they flew over at about 300 ft in the air, they made no sound. I thought at first it was a large aircraft lit up with all the lights on the bottom in the shape of a triangle, then all the lights switched places, telling me it was 12 separate aircraft.  Man that was cool and scary at the same time. I always believed in them and I always had a feeling we are not alone, but I never had a reason to believe, until now. We are not alone, believe it.<n>

They then made a manever north and then disappeared. there was no sound at all and they moved like a very fast low plane but were too fast and came to a complete stop before getting into Newark Airport airspace.  They had seemed to stop and observe the lights from Port Newark and then take off at high speed with no sound. 15 minutes later we seen another alone and it was brither then the other two and made the same manuevver and took off quickly to the north over the bay.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

They were below the clouds, maybe 3-4000 feet above us. The sky was clearing from rain/clouds we had all day. No wind. First time I have witnessed lighted objects moving in the sky without sound.<n>

Last night at around 8:40 PM my wife and I went out back to get some fresh air and look at the stars.  We live in an area of Florida that has little light pollution compared with some of the larger cities in the state.  As we looked up we began to discuss the object we’d seen a couple of nights before when to our surprise we began to see something similar coming toward us.  This object was similar to the first in that it was as bright as the brightest stars we could see and it had no flashing lights at all. I grabbed a pair of small Bushnell binoculars that I keep outside for spotting aircraft and quickly picked up the moving object.  This time it was heading in a trajectory that would take it directly overhead so my wife and I watched in amazement as this silent speeding object glided far overhead.  I’m a bad judge of altitude however I got the sense that it wasn’t something that was in orbit rather it was flying perhaps at several thousand feet??  As I mentioned before it was completely silent and kept a steady path.  It took it perhaps twenty to thirty seconds to traverse the sky and maintained the same level of brightness the entire time we observed it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This time it did not fade out as it did the night we saw it last. We watched it until it was beyond our field of view.  It came directly over us whereas the night before we’d seen it at an angle.  I was not able to make out anything other than the bright white light it gave off.  No other visible details were picked up by myself or my wife.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I’ll be outside again tonight hoping to see it again and this time I will have my video camera.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thanks for what you do!<n>

They just hovered in the sky for approximately 30-40 minutes, changing different colors, then one by one, just disappeared.   When my husband  zoomed in on the objects with his camera, you see the shape as perfectly round.  It was a clear and beautiful night, with a beautiful starry sky.  Those three objects were not stars!  We have a video of one of the objects.   Check it out for yourself!<n>

To stretch my back I had my hands on my hips and looked up at the starry sky and gave thanks to the Creator.  I saw a fast moving ‘star’ travelling at speed through the sky, initially I thought it was a ‘shooting star’, it turned directions very quickly.  As I bent my neck down  to relieve the neck extension of that position and looked up  it had gone, as well as approx 4 other stars in the same vicinity.  It was a wonderful, clear and beautiful night, no clouds and no aircraft in the sky.<n>

I wasstaring at the stars and out of nowhere this triangular, translucent, object appears, gliding slowly through the sky.  On its three corners were circle lights that were the color of the stars.  I immediately.  Tell the wife to make sure I&#39;m not seeing things and she verifies.  We then lose it for a good minute and then it reappears, only now it&#39;s hovering and blinking red and blue orange light.  A short time after it s  still blinking but releases what looks like a bunch of red lights ( atleast 10) and only a single one that flys away from triangular shape and down, then fades out. Ive never seen anything like that before.  It was pretty fascinating!<n>

That night I turned the television and lights off and walked into the kitchen to check the door before going to bed.  It was a beautiful and warm night so I walked out into the kitchen terrace up to the barrier to look up into the skies.  The skies were amazing, no clouds or humidity and millions of stars.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I could see in the far distance two planes moving with their flushing lights but when I looked up above me I saw an object in the shape of a ball and other balls in the shape of a 50 British pence coin attached to it.  The whole object was full of very powerful light pulsating but not moving.  At first I thought it might be a helicopter but realised it couldn&#39;t because it was absolutely silent and still but vibrating.  I bacame fascinated with the object and wanted to see it clearer, so I run in few seconds to grab my glasses but when I returned the object was gone with no sign of it.<n>

It was closer, much larger, black in color, and had numerous small, very dim, and blue lights on the bottom of it.  Still, it was silent, and moved in ways different than a jet plane.  It, too, was flying north on the eastern side, right over the Mill Ruins and the Mississippi River.<n>

Yet, not a single sound of any kind from it.  I just could NOT identify it or set it apart from what my many years of looking up had been used to seeing. It was a fascinating flame orange color which I had never seen before.  As it passed over head it was back to it’s soft luminescent white light beams and a dull light dot. We watched it as it moved on toward direct North eventually going below the tree tops.  We “other witnesses” shared a few speculative words, keeping it cool.

I saw one large bright red/orange ball, glowing very brightly, traveling from east to west.  A second ball appeared from behind the trees just a little higher than the first&#39;s path, then a third followed immediately after.  No more followed these 3.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They were traveling very close to a typical flight path where I tend to see airplanes, but these were larger than a normal airplane light and were not blinking.<n>

The 2 in the back were almost crossing paths at one point.  I proceeded to pull over and get out of my vehicle just outside of town near a corn field to get a better look.  I got out of my vehicle and watched 4 of them rise into the sky and changed from a orange color to a silver light as what looked like as they went higher in altitude and disappeared into the sky which was from my vantage point was almost straight up from where i was standing.  Then 1 more appeared from the same western direction the rest of them came from.  It disappeared in the sky almost at the same location in the sky as the previous 4 had done.  These fireball looking objects were bright orange and they DID NOT have oscillating lights like a airplane would have and did not produce any noise.  I was the only witness, I called family across town at 20:53CDT and my phone cut out in the middle of the call so i called again at 20:56CDT to see if they could see these objects but by time they answered the phone these objects had already disappeared in to the sky.  Unfortunately i did not get any pictures or videos of this event.<n>

There were four (4) circular bright orange orbs moving north easterly across the sky.   They were lined up in a straight line and their movement was slow on approach.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I got my binoculars to get a closer look at the orange orbs, they were not airplanes.  Then I thought they might have been helicopters, but there was absolutely no noise.  Then they moved northwest, and the first light sped up and disappeared into the clouds.  Then the second one sped up and disappeared.  The third followed and then the fourth.  According to the weather service in Gary, Indiana, the winds were calm and visibility was 15 miles with overcast skies.<n>

At about 45 degrees I saw what I thought was a star but noticed that it was moving on what I believe would be a westerly course.  I noticed that the object was as bright as the other stars in the sky which tonight was quite bright, but it had none of the blinking lights you’d associate with an aircraft.  It must have been moving very fast and we continued to watch it for about thirty to forty as it traversed a portion of the sky.  We began to notice that it was fading and watched it until it completely faded out.  At the time it faded I&#39;d say it was due west from us.  It was as bright as the brightest star in the sky when we first observed it.  We watch the skies regularly and we haven&#39;t seen anything like it before.<n>

This was during the day and they were white and at first I thought they were clouds.  They never moved and got larger and sort of translucent as we drove under them.  I could tell they were high because clouds were moving beneath them.  This is the first time I&#39;ve seen what I would truly call a UFO and it&#39;s unnerving.<n>

I opened the blind and began to stare at the light.  Then i opened the window to make sure it was not a glare on the window itself.  As i stared at the bright white light through the screen; the light remained stationary and then suddenly  the light became more and more dim into the distance until the light source was completely gone.<n>

As we drove up to our home, it must have noticed our vehicles headlights ; (as they were pointing in the direction of the craft when we drive up) because it started to move in our direction very  slowly as if it were scanning. I ran out of my vehicle to get a closer look and i immediately noticed a row of windows in between the lights.  The craft was a smooth dark metal and very very large in size. It was low to the ground and there was absolutely no noise to it. My husband went to take a picture as it slowly came towards us on the west side.  As soon as our phone camera flashed, the craft seemed to disappear within a flash.  We didn&#39;t even see the direction it went. It was like it just disappeared.  All we heard was a weird mechanical sound and a fast turbo speed like an airplane going really really fast.  This craft seemed to be a! bout 30-40 feet from the ground and was absolutely huge in size.  It is important to note that my husband and I love to look at the stars at night and previously spotted flashing lights (white and red) in the sky.  We were never really sure what they were jus knew the sound associated with the craft and that they moved very fast.  We bought binoculars to further investigate but on this particular night the craft was really low to the ground and when we took the binoculars from the car the craft was too close to get within lens.<n>

We spotted a very large very bright orange orb coming from the north heading south.  It was clear outside, almost no wind, yet this object seemed to have it&#39;s own propulsion, it did not seem to be carried by the wind, ect.  It was silent and had no emissions, yet traveled at a steady pace. It did not seem very far away(not up with the stars)and was the brightest color of orange you can imagine, almost like flameless fire or some sort of neon.  I am in the medical field, my husband is in the tech field, and our roommate is in construction.  We all agree with what we saw, and are still amazed by our experience<n>

I was in my hot tub facing west and saw a red light through the trees low on the horizon to the west.  First thought was its a helicopter from joint base lewis mcord in tacoma wa. It was moving from the west toward me in a direction of north east. It came from behind the trees into the open sky.  I then realized it ascending in altitude.  I then realized that if it was an aircraft with the direction of flight i would be looking at a green light the right side of the aircraft.  The light was a bright red and much bigger than a red navigation light on an aircraft. It was a steady red light and did not change brightness.  It climbed from the west on a north to north west heading at an angle of 45 to 50 degrees. Its speed was slow.  It went into the clouds, I estimate the bases of the scattered layer of clouds around 3000 feet.  It was a full moon and its position was the southeast sky about 20 degrees above the horizon.

I counted to fifteen lights before I lost count, because they were all moving around.  The lights stretched from high in the sky and far behind the front of the pack, all the way down to the tree line.  They looked like airplanes coming down at a major airport, but there is no airport in that part of the area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I continued to watch for the lights until I went into a wooded part of the interstate.  When I emerged a couple of miles down the road, I didn’t see any lights what-so-ever.

An object flew directly at our windshield, the middle section was squared with 2 round lights they were the brightness of a traffic light and both steady, one red light and one green, each was around 5&#34; in diameter, the surrounding squared shape was maybe 2 feet in length and 2 feet in width.  From both sides of the squared shape there appeared to be a thin obscured silver or white curved, almost rope like in appearance, spanning at least 15 feet on both sides, it is very hard to describe.  The object shocked us as I mentioned it came directly at our windshield and just before an impact would occur  the object when directly up into the sky and disappeared.  This all happened very fast.  We did go back to the location a few moments later and could not find anything out of the ordinary or that would have caused what we just seen.<n>

The night was relatively clear with just a few clouds.  My mother and I were sitting on our porch at our apartment simply talking.  I was facing away from the building towards Montgomery.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I first noticed the objects I could only register them as “bright lights.”  The longer I stared the more they resembled “orbs,” bright reddish-orange orbs.  They seemed to be traveling NW, towards Birmingham, and a steady pace, not very fast.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The first set of orbs in the front were brighter than most and in a triangle formation.  That set was followed by several other orbs; I could have probably counted 7 other orbs.  The orbs did not produce sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After watching and panicking for a bit, I ran inside to get my phone while my mother and brother ran downstairs to the front of our building to record on her phone.  She said that she saw “at least 15 other orbs.”  I came back on the porch with my phone and the orbs were still there, and still traveling at the same speed in the same direction.  The entire duration of what we witnessed was probably around 10 minutes, though it seemed like forever.  The orbs then faded out one by one, as if they were ascending.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is the first time this has ever happened to me.  And it’s very unnerving to view other reports in the same state that are so similar.  Not to mention Central Alabama alone. Is there a such thing as an explanation?<n>

Last night I saw the classic triangle UFO traveling north over Chinden and Cloverdale area.  It was approximately eight whitish lights in a triangle formation appearing at first to be a single triangle shaped craft but then the lights shifted making it look more like the lights were independent traveling in a triangular formation, I&#39;m not sure which.  It went over my head dead silent at an altitude of about 500 feet I would estimate.<n>

While traveling south along a residential road, we all noticed ahead of us in the sky,  five to seven orbs or spheres of light that appeared to be red or orange in color.   They appeared to be stationary in the sky at about a 45 degree angle from our position.  We all commented at how weird they looked.  At first we thought maybe some sort of lantern, but they did not move in the sky, nor did they flicker.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We dropped off the friend, and began traveling down the road in a westerly direction.  As I was driving, I couldn’t maintain eye contact so I would watch the road and occasionally glance up at the lights.   At one point, about 1 minute after dropping off the friend, I looked at the lights, then glanced back at the road for approximately three seconds , then looked back at the lights, and found that they all had vanished.  My daughter didn’t see them vanish either.<n>

They were very bright at first.  Then two more followed, followed by three more then two more.  I went and got my husband and children to see.  They seemed very bright at first then fading as they traveled very fast across the sky east to northwest.  It was unlike anything I have seen before.<n>

At approximately 10:15 p.m. one of the children yelled, &#34;UFO!&#34;  We all looked into the sky (Southeast) and saw what appeared to be a fireball making a straight line from the horizon.  Directly behind it, another appeared and then another, until there were six.  Eventually, a seventh emerged, following the same path.  They moved slowly, about the pace you would expect a very high jet to move across the sky.  They followed a straight path moving in a Northward direction and then one by one rose up into the sky and disappeared.  None of us could come up with any explanation of what these could be.  Initially, I thought they were Chinese lanterns but they were far too precise in their path and coordination.  Oddly, no sound was observed as these objects crossed the sky.<n>

At first it looked like a small plane with lights on each wing pointing forward – one light was higher than the other as you would see if a plane made a sharp turn.

There is an airport very close to here, so I know my fair share of what aircraft fly over this area and what they look like at night.  The strangest part of all of this is a small drone like craft with blinking navigation lights was coming up behind the object, when it seemed to simply disappear.

As close as I was to them, you could see a candlelight burning inside what appeared to be helium balloons.  The color was definitely yellow, then orange.  The winds aloft were quite strong, so the balloons moved at a good pace until they flew far enough out of sight and burned themselves out.  I knew, as well as the other witnesses knew, that people would report seeing strange objects because they weren&#39;t close enough to see what they actually were.  If you were in a different part of the valley, it would have been easy to assume that these objects were extraterrestrial.  One of the other witnesses got video footage and he is a pilot, with an Aeronautical Engineering degree as well.  Our conclusion was it was definitely a HOAX.  Another witness was a retired Air Force airplane crew chief and worked as a civilian crew chief at a local Fixed-Base Operations.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After showing the video footage to some friends the next day, one lady commented that she had seen a documentary on the local news about people illuminating and releasing these balloons as a commemoration for family deaths and or ceremonious or tragic events that have occurred.

I was watching  television and glanced over a few times, thinking how low the Moon was.  I was going to call my wife into the room to see it, she knows more about moon cycles than I do, but she was putting the baby to bed.  I left the room for about half an hour and the Moon was gone, normal.  Around 10:45 I noticed a light coming from my South window, to see a full moon moving in from the East.  The Moon in now in full view in my South window. I have no idea what the object was, but Orange in color, round and not moving.  It looked the size of a setting Moon, but hard to tell as the tree tops were in the way.  But very low on the horizon, if it were close possible half a mile away or less it would had to be less than 200 feet off the ground.  Oddly it feels like a false memory now, really can! ’t explain that. I do recall my dog barked that’s what made me look out the window and window on the door.

It looked abnormal to me so as soon as I pulled into my driveway I got out of my car and walked to the road where I could see the lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Upon observation I saw that the lights were traveling slowly in my direction.  I watched as it approached and it seemed to be maybe 2500 or 3000 feet in the air.  It was dark outside but the lights were very bright.  It appeared to be a black triangle with a white light on each of the three corners with one red light in the very middle of the craft. The white lights were blinking but I don&#39;t recall if the red one was or not. As it passed I noticed it was totally silent and on the back end of the craft I could almost make out a line of dimmer lights that were in between the rear corner lights. It may have been a reflection off the craft or dimmer lights, it was hard to tell. Th! e craft traveled in a straight line and was starting to go behind the treeline. No leaves on the trees yet. There were two jets higher in the sky that seemed to be following it. One of the jets was a lot higher than the craft and the second, even higher than that. I could hear the jets and was slightly annoyed because of the fact that since the triangular craft was so low I knew the sound was not coming from that. If it were a plane or jet that low it would have been much louder than the sound of the jets I heard. This thing seemed to silently glide across the sky. The craft was traveling in a north-easterly direction and the whole sighting took place within a four minute period. This also took place on a full moon, which was really big, by the way.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have always been interested in u.f.o.&#39;s but have never seen one.

It flew slowly, and there are almost no clouds in the sky, so we could see it pretty clearly. It took 10-20 seconds to go behind the tree next to the house, then another 30-60 to disappear into the cloud-haze on the horizon on the other side (moving NE to SW, toward the city).<n> <n><n> <n><n> It wasn’t blinking like the normal aircraft we get flying over (we’re in a military flight training path), and it made no noise.  It also flew in a really erratic way, always tending to the SW but zig-zagging a little. We both commented that it looked “wobbly.”  It was just a steady, round, bright white light with what appeared to be some kind of mist or haze around it. We could see the stars around it clearly, but this light looked foggy, even though it was large and not behind any clouds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Less than 2 minutes later, two helicopters flew over. One came from the NE, almost along the path the UFO took, and the other came from somewhere to the west.  It was just over the horizon, behind the hill, and I couldn’t see it for more than a couple of seconds at a time.  Both were flying really low, really fast, and they appeared to converge on the area where we’d last seen the light.  Although the UFO had disappeared into the clouds, we were able to see the blinking lights from the helicopters until they flew behind tree cover.<n>
4/25/13 20:00|Cherry Grove|SC|Triangle|30 minutes|My wife and I both witnessed a HUGE Triangular craft with 3 lights then 30 orange/yellow orbs in the same vacinity|6/2/13|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/097/S97933.html|103|ndxe201304| My wife and I both witnessed a HUGE Triangular craft with 3 lights then 30 orange/yellow orbs in the same vacinity<n> <n><n> <n><n> Hi there Peter.  I hope this message finds you well and in good spirits.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am turning to you with this because you have a better understanding of this universe, and are very open minded and connected individuals!  I just couldn&#39;t keep quiet about this extraterrestrial experience my wife and I went through a few days ago.  I think it&#39;s WONDERFUL what you&#39;re doing to challenge the minds of so many analytical thinkers.  I heard a statistic you said on a podcast about how 1 in 10,000 people don&#39;t speak out about what they witness/feel, and I will NOT be one of those who keep quiet!  Here goes...<n> <n><n> <n><n> My wife and I just got back from the beach a few days ago (Sunday April 28 2013) and I just can&#39;t seem to shake what happened to us last Thursday (April 25 2013)  Okay, just to give you a little background information on myself, I am 30 years old born 3/4/83.  My family has always been HUGE into astronomy, and I know a good bit about the sky. I&#39;m no expert, but I seriously grew up going out into fields with my uncle, grandma, grandpa, mom, dad, aunt, basically the whole family, and stargazing, and getting taught about the universe from a very young age anything from constellations to getting into philosophy conversations as to what we know about the universe.  Almost every one of them also own nice telescopes. So I guess you could say I&#39;m an amateur astronomer.  I have just never witnessed anything like what happened, and I CANNOT get it off my mind.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We had just arrived at our destination at Cherry Grove Beach in South Carolina around 8:00, and I have been DYING to get to the beach.  (I haven&#39;t been in like 3 1/3 YEARS, and I am a fish out of water...haha)  We proceeded to walk down onto the coastline.  We stood there for about 10 minutes on a pretty much empty beach.  The same night that we had that beautiful &#34;Pink Moon,&#34; gleaming down upon the surface of the water.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My wife asked me what all that lightning was out over the water.  I explained to her about how lightning can&#39;t ground itself over water, and the charge jumps from cloud to cloud...etc etc etc.  I&#39;m a bit of a science buff.  Anyways, as i finished explaining about the heat lightning,  I happened to turn my head to the right and look into the sky.  THIS is where it gets interesting...<n> <n><n> <n><n> I noticed 3 lights in the sky, and could actually make out an isosceles triangular &#34;silhouette&#34; around the perimeter of the craft.  One light in the back and two in the front.  Two of the sides were longer than the one side in the front.  As I looked closer, it started moving very slowly towards the moon in the brightly lit sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I then grabbed my wife&#39;s shoulder, and asked her if she was seeing this, and that I am not losing my mind so to speak.  She validated with a yelling, &#34;YES,&#34; as we continued watching in awe as it moved SILENTLY across the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Now, this craft had to be BIG.  I can&#39;t really determine the distinct size, but lets just say that it was approximately two, maybe more, football fields.  It was literally blocking out all of the stars behind it.   craft slowly crept across the sky for 7-10 minutes, and all of a sudden, the craft stops to a hover, and the underneath started sparkling!   Almost like a ton of high power strobe lights started going off all at the same time in a very spastic pattern.  It was SO beautiful and scary all at the same time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My wife pointed at another star, and asked me, &#34;Is that another one?&#34;  I glanced over, and reassured her that it wasn&#39;t, and as we looked back to resume observing the craft ascended higher into the atmosphere and out of sight.  I told her…&#34;This isn&#39;t over, there&#39;s GOT to be more to what we just saw.&#34;<n> <n><n> <n><n> Well, little did I know at that moment, that my intuition was spot on.  We stood there for about 10 minutes talking about what had just happened.  MY wife&#39;s cousin, who was meeting us down there, called her cellphone, and she turned her back to the ocean, and walked away from me for a second.  I kept my eyes fixed on the night sky the WHOLE TIME.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As my wife was talking to her cousin on her cell phone, I was astounded to witness ANOTHER strange anomaly.  One Orb flashed bright Orange with yellow around the aura I guess you could call it. Flashed bright, then fizzled out as it fell in a random flight pattern. As that one burned out, one more, then another one! During the THIRD one, I turned and yelled &amp;quot;TURN AROUND NOW!!!&amp;quot; As she did, we both saw roughly 30 of these glowing Orbs moving frantically around a central area. They all seemed to move random at first, then it seemed TO ME like maybe that they were either attacking or communicating with the craft (not necessarily force, but more along the lines of telling it to &amp;quot;GO AWAY&amp;quot;), or either going INTO the craft (as it looked as if the orbs were going though some kind of perimeter of the craft or force field.) It was in the same proximity of where the craft would have actually been in the atmosphere given the speed it was moving, and the direction it ! was moving, yet, you couldn&#39;t actually see the craft. I don&#39;t know...I have been at a loss for words, and the whole experience has been constantly turning over and over in my head. If there is ANY type of guidance, or advice, or ANYTHING, I would greatly appreciate it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thanks again for being so open minded, and giving yourself back to the universe and helping to open the minds of the world.   YOU ARE BEING HEARD AND MAKING AN IMPACT!<n>

No sound assoc.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Roughly 10:43 p.m. est. 3 people inside of house near open window witnessed a cold blue/bright white light flash which lit up the entire inside of house as well as the outside. This was observed as all 3 were facing different directions, for the most part. The flash last less than an approximated 1/8 second.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was no audible &amp;quot;boom&amp;quot; or any other sound associated with the flash that was observed. Although there was a silence defined by lack of the usual animal nighttime sounds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was also observed by a friend in Gautier, Mississippi.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The sky was very clear early in the night with numerous stars visible &amp; a bright moon to the south. But it had gotten only slightly less clear with light haze in the upper atmosphere indicated  also by the ice crystal formed halo ring around the moon around the time of the flash.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Location history: House is situated in a rural location 360ft.south of HWY98. 200ft. from the end of Barin Naval Airfield which is a very lightly used strip used for training pilots. It is mostly a wooded area with less than 2 small homes between the strip &amp; above stated house.<n> <n><n> <n><n> All 3 people have a history of law enforcement. One is an army veteran of 11 years. One is an artist and the other is now an activist/humanitarian.<n>

The little dipper is to my left.  I am watching a jet high in the sky when I see a bright light come on out to the right of the jet.  The light was bright but I could see that it was behind the jet.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then the light came straight at me so fast it seemed to &#34;ride&#34; the light and approached me so fast and stopped suddenly in its tracks.  Then in a split second the light turned off and it looked rectangular and I could make it out by the reflection of the bright full moon.  It only seemed about a 1000 yards away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then in the next split second it appeared to &amp;quot;slingshot&amp;quot; itself back and to the left where it came from.  I could see the shape get smaller and smaller til it was gone!<n> <n><n> <n><n> I got the impression it was &#34;stalking&#34; the westbound jet I was initially watching.<n>

I was watching the sky just west and a little north of us because I thought it was unusual to see 7 jet airplanes flying so closely in the same area of sky.  I know they are farther from one another in the sky, but from the ground they looked very close to one another.  Still odd to see them so bunched up considering how vast the sky is!   It seemed as if they were confused, or that some air-traffic controller must have fallen asleep on the job.  My son agreed and as we watched the last two planes intersect safely there appeared a white light in the sky just above them.  At first glance I just thought it was a star. My son saw it too and it dawned on us that it wasn&#39;t there before!  We watched for a about 15 seconds and it moved a little, turned red, and simply vanished!  The rest of the evening I watched the sky for any other unusual happenings. I stayed up until 2:30 am and nearly everytime!  I went outside I noticed one strange reoccuring thing-all air traffic was bunched up in the same manner as earlier in the evening.  We never see so much air traffic out our way in the first place, so it just seems odd to see 3 to 7 planes all in the same patch of sky multiple times throughout the evening.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

I was standing in my kitchen and heard my dog bark one time. I looked out my back door and my dog barked one time again (this is strange behavior for my dog). I wanted to find out what he was barking at so I stepped outside onto my porch. An orange horizontal light caught my eye. I said out loud to myself “what the hell was that?” I took my glasses off and looked back to the area where the orange light was hovering. I still saw the light.  I put my glasses back on.  I decided to video record the orange light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I ran back into my house and retrieved my phone from my purse. I then went to my back door and started recording. I could not believe what I was witnessing.  I recorded video on my phone for several seconds.  The orange light was hovering between the ground and the electric lines.  There was only one light.  The light was between 1 and 3 foot.  The orange light hovered between 3 to 5 minutes.!  The light also expanded and shrunk.  The orange light just shrunk so small it vanished.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I then phoned my fiancee and told him what happened.  When I got to my office I was still wondering what I had witnessed earlier in the morning. I decided to search on the internet and see if there were any similar sightings. I came across a article that I will provide a link to at the end of my statement. The picture in the article that I came  across had the exact same light that I had witnessed earlier in the morning. I then decided to report what I had witnessed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I got home from work I decided to phone the National UFO Reporting Center. I spoke with Peter Davenport. Peter listened to me tell my experience and then told me to write and submit a written statement.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Summary of Account:  Date: 4/25/13 Time: Approximately 7:35 A.M.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Direction: Approximately 100 degrees East (according to the compass on my phone) One orange horizontal light Expands and Shrinks between 1-3 foot Witnesses: None Website Link: http://www.examiner.com/article/data-suggests-orange-light-ufo-reports-cross-u-s-across<n>

It was about 2 miles south/southwest of Univeristy of Phoenix Stadium and as i started recording it for about 3 mins it would hover over then change altitude and direction at the same time. It looked like a Diamond main body with two small triangles attched at the left and right bases making one big triangle. but there were seperation between the 3 objects.

Turns seemed to be made across a central axis, without a change in formation.

I could not tell the shape of the object, it looked like a star. I know it wasn&#39;t a star because you could tell that it was lower than the stars. At first I thought it could be 2 satellites, one in front of the other.  Except I have seen satellites and that isn&#39;t what this was. It actually could have been one craft with one light in the front and one in the rear.  I saw it move across the sky, away from me, for about 20 seconds before it just disappeared.  It didn&#39;t appear to just shoot off into space.  I just moved across the sky and disappeared. If this was 2 objects, they were moving in formation at the same speed.  This wasn&#39;t a know aircraft, it was completely silent. From my point of view the object looked like this:   . .   Could this have been 2 satellites moving across the sky in formation?  Sure.  Only I&#39;ve seen satellites!  before and satellites always appear smaller, and stay in the sky a lot longer.  Plus I&#39;ve never seen 2 move across the sky in a formation like this. Let alone seem to appear and disappear so quickly   (Previously reported. I gave the wrong date, i said 2012. This happend 2013)<n>
4/24/13 00:00|Jacksonville|FL|Fireball||I saw fireball like objects in the sky on New Year's Eve.  I saw atleast two that night. It was like slow moving, flickering.|5/15/13|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/097/S97330.html|126|ndxe201304| I first saw fireball like objects in the sky on New Year&#39;s Eve.  I saw at least two that night. It was like slow moving, flickering fireballs that were low in the sky.  Seemingly way lower than your average plane and after 30 seconds or so, as I am trying to figure out what it is they flicker out and completely disappear.  The reason why I am reporting this is because I just saw the exact same thing and googled it and found all these similar reports.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Tonight I only saw one.   Same exact thing.  Slow moving, flickering like a fireball, I initially thought it resembled what the average person identifies as a comet.  Then just appeared to almost &amp;quot;burn out&amp;quot;. I&#39;ve talked to several people about it because we have a naval base local.  But tonight a clearly US aircraft was flying towards this right as I saw it......there is no way this is not something recognized on US radar.  Clearly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.  PD))<n>

The white lights made a triangular formation if you connected the dots.. the &amp;quot;lead&amp;quot; constant white light had a slow blinking red one right next to it (looking up at it I think the red one was at the right of the constant white lead one) it was traveling from the South ..  Moving slow not stopping as far as I could tell. I went outside it was a quiet sound  could almost make out a the figure of the body as dark maybe black, chevron in shape as it passed over our house ?? No other light colors anywhere on shape.  It was not a plane. It was a definite figure of a craft as lights were spaced just so. It got my attention cause the light coming towards from the window was bright at first I thought thats odd, kept looking and then thats not a plane and then planes dont have constant white lights with one blinking red, never saw that before is why it peaked my curiosity? then..  Im going to go outside an! d check it out.  Someone else told me they saw it too probably within a minute or two after me go over their house .. I believe We are on a flight path as I have seen in the summer time all on the same day.. big cargo planes traveling back and forth atleast 3-4 times during day light.So maybe something was flying possibly to Griffis AirForce base in Rome, NY ????  All I know is Im still thinking about what it was.  I wish I had thought to grab my camcorder.. but didnt.  I dont necessarily think UFO but wondered if there is any aircraft like this but makes me wonder.<n>

Then a quick burst of red light and it was gone.<n>

My son said there&#39;s one dad.  I told him no I think thats a star and kept looking.  He said Dad its moving!!  I looked and it was!!  It was bright red and as it approached it was a triangle.   There was no flashing lights as with airplanes, but it had a green light on one end, red light on the other end, and a white light in the front.  Then suddenly a bright light lit up in the center of it and never came back on.  No sound with it at all.  All of a sudden all the lights went white....and it kept going... Very strange.

They travel at unbelievable speeds.....and then stop.....and reverse direction or continue on the observed trajectory.  They are tiny.....but observable as though they are flying among the stars/planets/constellations but appear to be of a lower altitude.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As a backyard star gazer, I am aware of satellites and aircraft.  These tiny white &amp;quot;lights&amp;quot; are everywhere yet seem to be unnoticed by conventional aircraft such as planes and helicopters.  I believe they are thousands of feet above conventional aircraft, but one would assume that radar or pilots would be aware of them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> These tiny bright &amp;quot;flying&amp;quot; objects came to my attention about three years ago.....and, the only other &amp;quot;validation&amp;quot; I have had is a man named &amp;quot;LARRY&amp;quot; who called into Coast to Coast on open lines on Friday, April 12th or 19th.  He was attempting to describe this same sighting.  Obviously, Noory couldn&#39;t explain what &amp;quot;Larry&amp;quot; was seeing....but I was IMMEDIATELY shocked to listen to a person who described EXACTLY WHAT I SEE in my own backyard on dark nights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Please, somebody, tell me you are seeing these small white &amp;quot;lights&amp;quot; flying all over the place performing maneuvers that modern day aircraft is incapable of doing.....and, they also STOP.....JUST STOP......as though they are attempting to imitate being a star.......<n> <n><n> <n><n> These nightly observances are so compelling that they have consumed me lately.  I truly would appreciate some validation by others who look intently into the night sky and see tiny white dots doing crazy maneuvers.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

In the night sky the moon illuminated much of its light.  In addition, the clouds traveled in a fast pace manner in the direction, diagonally, towards this object. For clarity, an x shape could be formed in terms of the clouds and object.  Furthermore, this object seemed to be a diamond/imperfect circular shape.  A bright white light in the front glowed as it moved toward my direction. It moved at an incredibly fast speed with no sound following.  And had a short tail of vapor, not smoke, coming from the back end in the shape resembling a drawn out triangle.  This vapor dissipated rapidly.  When it approached directly overhead of my view I determined the shape and saw green and yellow lights going around the craft.<n>

Around 5 minutes later another wave of around flew by,silently. Witness 1 saw them first, when witnesses 2 and 3 came out they did not appear.  Then they appeared with more frequency and numbers.  They seemed to swoop in, (going from East to West)in arcs or vees, and glide overhead, disappearing from sight just a little behind us. The largest wave was over 40, they came in strong waves 5 times, and smaller waves at least 9 times. The intervals lengthened to roughly 9 minutes between sightings, they seemed to be flying higher, except for the last sighting. It was 2 lights, they were first spotted directly over head, where they hovered for a moment, then flew lower and out over the street then headed Southwest and disappeared. They had wings, but no other features were distinguishable other then the orange light.<n>

In the sky above the ridge line was an enormous pulsing light. Red, yellow, blue, orange.... It kept flashing. My husband grabbed the binoculars to see if he could get a better view. He positioned the binoculars on the railing of the porch and took a look.  The lights were rotating around, the object was spinning.  Then a small light began to drip (Like melting wax on a candle) a singular droplet of light started to descend to the tree line. It moved so very slowly.  Slow like 1/10 the speed of a feather falling  When it reached the level of about half the height of the trees trunks height it zoomed to the west.  Still visible the light flickered as it passed between the trees.  Then another began to fall from the ship, as slow and steady as the last. They looked like white glowing orbs.   The size of baseballs to me.  Then the lights shot through the trees in many directions, before returning back to! being beneath the big rotating lights, which had been steadily moving North (the size of 2 basketballs).  This continued until I had visually counted 6, my husband watching along side me. Then just as they had descended, like rewind but very very slowly the lights ascended back to the bright rotating lights. When the last white glowing orb was absorbed the entire thing vanished. This lasted over 20 minutes. We called a friend to see if he could see it or come to watch from our house because the view was so astonishing. We were on the phone with him almost the entire time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then about 30 minutes later we stepped back out to see if it was back, and we watched what we thought was possibly a satellite move slowly over the house, but just as my husband was explaining why he thought this was a satellite it swerved very quickly and vanished.<n>

My neighbor puledl into his driveway so asked if he&#39;d seen them. He told me he didn&#39;t see anything but as we spoke, another orb appeared, following the exact course as the others.  It was identical in every way to the group of three that passed overhead 5 minutes before. Chinese lanterns?  Maybe so, but Monday night at 10 pm is an unusual time for something like that.  I watched them fly for a distance of several miles before the ambient light drowned them out.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

My house sits on the east face of a mountain which goes down into a small valley and then up again – to a ridge that I see if I look directly east from my home.  This ridge is the first mountain (of the Rocky Mountains) and directly east of it is North Boulder.  I live on what is the second protruding mountain and my home sits across this small valley just a bit higher in altitude than the first ridge.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I noticed out of the window a row of colored lights blinking different colors, 5 or 6 of them in a row, and it looked like they were on something that was rotating slowly in a circle.  It traveled slowly from the South East going directly North, up above the ridge of this mountain across the valley from me.   As I looked at it I thought it was a plane at first, or maybe a helicopter.  I became concerned at how close it was flying to the trees and houses, and then suddenly it stopped and just glided back the opposite way.  Then it stopped again and continued the way it was going and by this point it was directly across from my house above the ridge.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I could almost make out the shape of it, and at this point I yelled to my husband, “Quick! Come in here! There’s a UFO!” My husband jumped up and ran into the bathroom and just before he arrived the craft went up and down and back and forth one more time but just as he looked out the window it dropped behind the ridge.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I told him, “Oh, I can’t believe you missed it! Wait - maybe it will come back up.”  He had stepped into our shower (closer to the window) and was looking down into the valley and he said, “I see it! There are at least 2 of them!”  I stepped in beside him and looked down into the valley and saw that he was looking at 2 little (these are hard to describe) areas of light.  They weren’t orbs or balls of light, but the ground was being lit up – as if from a big flash light or spot light, but there were no beams of light projecting from anywhere, and they were moving faster than any spot light could possibly move.  They circled around a certain area, then a bigger area, it all seemed very random, and then they were gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My husband never saw the blinking craft - but if not for him; I would have never seen the flashing lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> That’s it, we stared out the window for a while and then tried to go back to sleep.<n>

About the time I got to Stewart, my passengers and I saw a blue light coming out of the sky in a large beam.  One of my passengers thought it was a tornado, but it wasn’t moving.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was about 10:00 pm on April 21, 2013.  It was very dark, except for this bright blue beam.  As we approached Hector, we realized that the beam was right above that town.  I wondered if the high school had one of those big spot lights on, but as I turned off of the highway into a dark Hector neighborhood, I realized that wasn’t what it was.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My passengers and I got out of the vehicle and realized we were standing in the blue light.  It was dispersed all around us and we all started to look up in the sky to see where it was originating from.  There was a lot of cloud cover, but as the clouds moved a black rectangle appeared above us and glided to the right and then back.  It was a perfect rectangle and completely devoid of any light.  We all were a little intrigued, and scared.  I tried to take a snapshot, but my camera wouldn’t work.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We all saw the same thing, and there was no explanation for this.  About a week later, a family member of mine told me that something unexplained broke a utility pole at the very tip.

4/21/13 21:00|Clinton Township|MI|Oval|20 minutes|2 Crafts Spotted Over Macomb County, MI, in April, 2013.|10/14/13|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/103/S103209.html|158|ndxe201304| 2 Crafts Spotted Over Macomb County, MI, in April, 2013<n> <n><n> <n><n> My son was looking outside to the south around 9-9:15pm, on a Sunday night and he spotted a relatively large orange orb that was blinking.  He called to me to come check it out and I did.  We went outside of my home and looked south (approximately 5-10 miles away from us) at this object.  This orb was orange ( about the size of an aspirin in a distance comparison) and also pulsating a faint white light while it stayed stationary about 10,000 to 15,000 feet in the sky.  It wasn&#39;t nearly as high as a passenger jet would fly, but higher than a helicopter or small airplane would fly.  It was definitely bigger than a helicopter or small plane.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was no sound at all from this craft and while it mainly stayed put, it would move towards the north, periodically.  As I watched this craft for approximately 3-4 mins, I noticed to the southwest of it was another orange orb that was pulsating.  No white light coming from it, but it was blinking and heading directly to the other craft.  It was smaller (about half or a quarter of the size of the 1st craft I saw) and as it came to the larger craft at a fast rate of speed, I thought it was going to crash right into the bigger craft.  It stopped abruptly and hovered near it, both crafts blinking and now the pattern of the light pulses changed.  Almost like they were communicating messages.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After about 5 mins, the smaller craft moved more north of the stationary craft and then (almost in a reverse move) came back to the larger stationary craft.  Again, pulsating orange and white lights from the bigger craft and just orange pulsating lights from the 2nd smaller craft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Next thing I noticed was both crafts appeared to be heading north at a slow but steady speed.  All of a sudden, the smaller craft shot straight out to the west at a high rate of speed.  I could see it made a huge distance from the larger craft in just 3-5 seconds.  Nothing made on this planet could change directions that fast and then cover a huge distance.  Many, many miles of distance.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was able to see the smaller craft for awhile, as the entire west sky had no obstructions.  I watched as much of it as I could, periodically checking to see where the 1st larger craft was and shifted my vision back to the smaller craft (still heading due west).  It was only then the light faded out on the small craft, that I couldn&#39;t see it any longer and I immediately set my sights on the large craft.  It had moved to the north a bit more and wasn&#39;t going very fast.  Lights were still orange and white...still pulsating.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Around 20 mins or so, I decided that I needed to head back indoors and that is the last time I saw this craft.  My son and I did not feel anything except for excitement and awe.  Only wished I had my camera working.  This isn&#39;t the first time I have experienced looking at an unidentified object near my area.<n>

I was 30 minutes out on the freeway going home from my friends house wich was a 30 minute drive away in maricopa, I spotted them because of how bright they were , as we got closer to my house we got closer to where the lights were wich was in chandler, by chandler and frye rd. so we get closer up and then you could see that it just stayed and floated in one position or another all in the form of a triangle. . moving and shifting from one position to another, it was also at lower altitude then some planes in the sky at the time , I would say the lights were 3 or 4 miles from me at chandler and frye rd. but saw them more then 30 minutes away from my house<n>

Tonight around 8:30 I saw this shape moving across the sky on a highway.  The light in front was blinking red, three others solid white in a diamond shape.  Thought it was just a plane but thought it was weird to be so low.  When i drove farther and saw the object on my left I was freaked out because I did not see a different orientation, rather the same shape of lights.  There was no noise.  Seemed to be only a few hundred yards max above the tree level.  By the time I would have thought of taking a picture it was gone. Weirdest thing.  There is an air force base in the town over so it was probably just an aircraft but still thought I&#39;d report.

The object maintained altitude and position for 10 minutes or so before drifting to the North West over the next 20 minutes where I lost sight of it.  I describe the object as metallic only because it reflected sunlight. I was barely able to see these reflections without polarized glasses.<n>

Since I am a retired flight attendant, I would say it was abaout 6,000 ft. up.   My first thought was it could be an aircraft on fire and slowly descending.  It was not moving fast like a meteor or shooting star but at a medium pace like an airplane.  It was  moving from west to east in the sky.  There was no tail or wing lights just a large oblong light.  There was no engine sound like other aircraft that we have heard before.  Not a helicopter or airship to my knowledge.  We both watched it for approximately 30 to 60 seconds.   My husband tried to take a picture with the cell phone to no avail.  The strange thing that makes me still feel uneasy, towards the end of its journey the light started to fade.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then to our astonishment it disappeared completely into the night sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I went into the house and returned about a half hour later because I couldn&#39;t believe what I saw and then didn&#39;t see.  I thought maybe there was a cloud cover.  Dawn was starting to break and the sky was as clear as could be.<n>

We ended up on the outskirts of town where you could see the stars clearer when I noticed a flashing light like a radio tower.  We had pasted several radio towers with blinking lights on them, but I could tell it wasn&#39;t a tower or attached to the ground because when the car would turn, the object didn&#39;t move relatively away from whatever particular direction we were turning. It was hovering.  I didn&#39;t say anything to anyone else until I was completely clueless as to what and was and positive it wasn&#39;t attached to the ground.  Once I did say something, the other witnesses were just as baffled.  The lights on it were blinking. Along a slant as if it were cyclindrical or saucer like.  At one point it evenness seemed to go the same direction as the car at the same speed.  Almost as if it was watching us watch it.  Then, few! minutes after we had been watching it, we passed a wooded area that obscured our view of the object and once our vision had regain clarity, it was gone. Very odd indeed.<n>

It was so bright much brighter than the stars that were out.  It was moving way slower than a plane and no sound was noted.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When we reached our house we looked out at our huge back yard to see about 9 groups of these lights hovering in and out of the cloud covers.  Some where like bum bells with out a pole doing the same motions up and down side to side.  It was odd.  Several would get brighter and they disappear and in seconds return.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A plane passed by and these orbs did not seem to have any forward movement of travel.  We saw one hover in and out of our tree line with a scan of 3 white lights going around it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We called other people over to take a look and they were puzzled as well thinking UFO?  They disappeared a few at a time leaving 2 to dance in the sky over an hour this went on. I took a video on my ipod touch however it did not come out great but you can see the dancing pattern of this thing.  Last night I noticed one was back. I live very close to the mountains and have heard rumor that a lot of activity takes place in Bartlett.<n>

It moved very quickly from north to south over the Chesapeake bay.  It moved out of sight.  About 30 minutes later another one went by faster and higher.  The second one was pink/red then turned to orange.  The first one was orange.<n>

I was sitting outside and all of a sudden a line of blinking lights appeared in the sky. They started moving so I went and got my boyfriend to ask him what they were. He didn&#39;t know so he went and got his dad.  His dad was baffled and called out our room mate.  He also grabbed a camera and attempted to take pictures. He then stopped a guy on the side of the road and pointed them out to them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They were star colored and the last few in the line weren&#39;t moving as much as the others. They all blinked rapidly and moved up and down in the sky.  The first one moved higher in the air and continued to flash.  The next 3-4 lowered and moved back up, they also continued to flash.  They all headed westward and sank below the buildings and out of view.<n>
4/20/13 22:05|Newbury Park|CA|Light|2-3 minutes|Unusual light spiraling above Boney Mountain|5/15/13|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/097/S97271.html|177|ndxe201304| Unusual light spiraling above Boney Mountain<n> <n><n> <n><n> While sitting on our couch and looking out through our large window, I saw a single light - much like a typical airplane- enter my field of vision crossing the sky in a straight line from the West to the East.  Nothing unusual at first.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The light then stopped, did a quick spiral downward, changed altitude and lifted back upward. It next appeared to make a circular pattern parallel to the ground, but then suddenly changed and made another circle, this time perpendicular to the ground.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Finally it began to drift back the way it had come, heading from East to West, as it returned in that direction it dropped down in another spiral motion, at the bottom of the spiral it froze momentarily before raising up quickly and continuing westward.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At this point I left the room to get my wife, but when we returned the object was gone.  The entire incident lasted between 2 and 3 minutes at approximately 22:05 on April 20th in the airspace above Boney Mountain in Newbury Park, ! California.<n>

I pointed this out to my boyfriend and he thought this was unusual and said it looked like a Christmas tree shape.  I did not notice if they were moving in any certain direction as the objects were at a far distance. My boyfriend thought the objects seemed to be in one place, almost like a constellation.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At this point I attempted to take a picture with my cellphone, but was unable due to the far distance of the objects and the bright parking lot lights.  While I tried to take the picture I noticed a white flash, at first I thought it may have been lightning and even asked my boyfriend if it was supposed to rain, as we have had storms the past few days, but none today. We observed that the red lights were gone after the flash, and were unable to relocate them anywhere.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We live close enough to O’Hare airport, and are familiar with the lights that planes have. These lights did not look in any way, shape, or form like plane lights.<n>

I tell my mom and all three of us go out.  They were three orange lights that were still then started to move.  The lights were orange then turned a little red then back to orange.  Then they were moving forward and departing away from each other. The 2 lights that were behind the first one disappeared then the front one disappeared then came back again and then was gone at last.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My mom had her phone and was going to the camera by that time the lights had disappeared. The lights were in a fallen triangle shape, but then lost the shape.<n>

Looking north we watched 6 orange spheres moving south over the beach, all the same height, all spaced the same from one another, all moved at the same speed, all were silent.  When they arrived in front of us they turn 90 degrees out over cardiff reef moving west and then vanished.  We could here the car tire noise on hwy 101 below us and knew that these objects were not helicopters.<n>

Immediately, I called my son and wife to come out thinking it was a large meteorite flying by.  The object looked like it had a fire trail and was fairly large.  I told my son to run in the house and grab my cellphone and as soon as he brought it out I started filming with the phone&#39;s video camera.  Object was moving fairly fast and had a very shallow approach angle but seemed to slow down later.  I turned on the phone&#39;s video camera and caught some footage of the object.  The other thing that we all agreed on later that there was no sound (no prop or engine noise).  As I was filming, our trees where in the way so I briefly lost video of the object but then got the camera back on it.  Object looked reddish orange with some yellow.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have video but it&#39;s 52 mbytes<n>

Hovered briefly then reversed course and disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Walked outside my house just after dusk and noticed a silent group of lights traveling overhead from east to west.  There were four lights in what seemed to be a upright square shape (2 white, 1 blue, and 1 red). Very bright colors that were quite beautiful. I think this is what attracted my eyes to the object. I had the impression that the object was quite close.  It appeared to be 30-50 feet in altitude and 100-200 yards away. It also seemed to be quite small.  Perhaps the size of a small cellphone held at arm’s length.  After a few seconds, the object stopped and hovered briefly then reversed course quickly back to the east and disappeared behind a row of homes in our subdivision. I went back in the house to the upstairs bedroom to see if I could spot the object but it was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What I found interesting was the complete silence of the object and how smoothly it moved through air. Weather conditions were clear, no clouds or wind with an ambient temperature of! ~60 degrees. It was definitely not an aircraft.  A helicopter could have performed similar maneuvers but it was completely silent. The only thing that I can imagine it was would be some sort of remote control drone, but a completely silent one. Our home is quite close to a local municipal airport so I am familiar with the aircraft that land there. This was something completely different.<n>

I was approximately 7 miles away on top of Spickert knob Road up in Floyd’s knobs and the view that I had you could see the entire landscape and is the highest point in that particular area While I was waiting for the show to start I was taking pictures of the air show, as I was taking photos I saw a group of objects that would appear and disappear in the sky.  I saw them three different times each time and each time I tried to focus on them I was unable to.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I was reviewing my pictures the next day I saw that I happened to catch the group of objects high in the sky over the city well above the airplane that is in the picture.  There looked to be two groups of aircraft flying in formation.  When I soon get in on the picture the crafts all look round cylindrical with a metal color with a definite solid shape on all of them and what looks to be a sit atmosphere at the center of each of the ship much like the reported flying disc.  I emailed a copy of the image to your site in JPEG form however I still have the original photo and a raw format that is too large to email at this time.<n>

It was very high up but could be seen plainly as a &#34;classic&#34; flying saucer.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I watched it for about a minute as I idled in traffic that was standing still for quite awhile.  I continued to watch it over a 2-3 minute period, it just kept hovering and wobbling and rotating.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I drove forward about 5 MPH for abit, I was able to continue to watch it.  It stayed in the same area the whole time, hovering and spinning.  It was slate grey color.  I noticed typical aircraft, jets, etc. flying toward or away from one of the airports...this saucer object was much lower than the aircraft I saw in their flight pattern.

I didn’t notice the object then, but when I was down loading my camera to my computer this object that seemed to come from the water and go into a bright light.  Notice that the trail starts from the water through the trees.  I also have a photo in the same area a couple of frames later of four objects of light in a diamond formation.<n>

At first I thought it was a star but the light then slowly faded away.  Five minutes had passed then the light returned shined bright for about a minute then proceeded to head north.  While moving in northern direction light slowly faded away.  As I headed south of Allendorf I noticed the light again in the original spot previously before it moved.  Shined and dimmed for about a minute then eventually dimmed completely out never saw the light again the rest of my trip.<n>

It&#39;s bright, then fades, hovers, then circles.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In the north/east sky, what looks like a shooting star - is moving erratically.  It shoots up, down, north, back east again, then in circles.  Then shoots south, then north, grows bright (almost brilliant), then fades.  Returns, goes in large circles, then drops at a high rate of speed, only to shoot right back up again.  Hovers, disappears, then returns to perform more maneuvers. Can&#39;t figure out for the life of me what that would be.  Could be seing several, or the same one criss crossing the night sky.  This is the second time this month we have seen the light.  My son-in-law saw same thing two weeks ago, told us and we laughed.  He called us outside tonight and pointed up and low and behold, he was right.  Zig-zagging all over the place.  No color, just a white light that looks like a star when stationary or hovering.  Then is begins shooting all over the place.  Weird!  My IPhone camera just couldn&#39;t capture a picture or video, too much ambient light ar! ound.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

If memory serves it was April 2013.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Toward the west I saw 2 white lights coming over ridge or small mountain about 2 miles away.  One light was to the left (south) and the other to the right (north) I thought they were airplanes that were too close to each other at first, and said to my friend that the FAA shouldn’t allow planes to fly that closely together.    Then the light to the left got even closer to the light on the right and I gasped thinking there would be a midair collision of the 2 planes.  As the lights got closer to our location we both realized that it wasn’t 2 airplanes but 1 extremely large craft that was very slowly rotating so it simply appeared that the lights were getting closer together.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As it got closer other smaller red colored lights could be seen between in the white lights on the sides of the craft.  The craft made no noise at all.  It was difficult to make out the shape because it was dark, but it was relatively flat and was either triangular or circular.  Looked approximately 500-1000’ from side to side.  Shockingly large.  WAY bigger than an airplane or even 2 airplanes.  It took about 60 seconds to travel the 2 miles.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The craft traveled from over the ridge and was descending as it traveled to the northeast.  Estimate it was approximately 2000 ft up and to the north of us.  We lost sight of it as it descended below the treeline.   I started to wonder if it might land on Merrymeeting Lake or Ossipee Lake.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A lot of people around here have experienced UFO sightings, but being New Englanders, nobody bothers to report them.   However if you consult with people who live in Ossipee, NH, UFO sightings are extremely common and have been for over 75 years.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date is approximate.

I looked up and saw a large plane.. possibly 747.   Nothing unusual.  But about 1 mile away from it, I saw what I first thought were 5 large birds flying in formation.  But then I got the feeling that there was something strange...the &#34;birds&#34; were a dim orange and flying a bit too &#34;tight&#34; the distance between them never changed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So I really focused on what I was seeing and noticed what seemed to be a triangular craft with 5 total lights (the &#34;;birds&#34;) flying twice as fast (or maybe even more) than the airplane that first caught my attention.  From the moment I observed it (over the Ocean) until it disappeared (somewhere north of downtown LA), it only took about 20 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Meanwhile, the passenger plane was still very much visible and audible.<n>

It was Friday 4/19 between 5:30 and 5:40 am.  There was a light rain, but I couldn’t see any stars, so I don’t think there were any breaks in the clouds.  There was no oncoming traffic. I’ve travelled this route for years at this time of day and know the reflections I see in my windows, this wasn’t a reflection.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I saw 2 pinpoints of light straight ahead and up high, they were just far enough apart that you could see 2 separate lights and seemed to be just underneath the clouds.  I began slowing down, looking up at the lights and glancing back at the road several times.  In the space of 2 to 3 seconds, they faded out as if they rose into the clouds in unison.  The entire sighting lasted approximately 10 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I want to add another sighting I had a few years ago to this report because it’s older.  If  the site administrators want me to make a separate report, I will.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was early January, no later than January 3rd or 4th.  Around 5:30 am. I was travelling North on Rt. 7 just outside of West Liberty, going down the hill toward where Rt. 7 turns to the right and Rt. 519 begins.  I don’t remember the sky conditions, but it wasn’t raining or snowing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My attention was drawn to my upper left field of vision to a very bright, white light, a little larger than a star.  As I was turning my head toward it, it shot straight ahead and disappeared over the horizon.  The entire sighting lasted 2 to 3 seconds.<n>

I stopped and shut off the engine in the middle of a field to take in the night. I saw what looked like a satellite to the West and it was heading North. It traveled a small distance like a meteor, but slower, like a satellite. It disappeared like an Iridium Flare, but reappeared at a different elevation relative to the horizon. It traveled again like it had before, then disappeared again. The third, fourth, and fifth times it appeared it was going in different directions. First West, then Northeast, then down toward the horizon. I&#39;ve never fully believed in ETs until that night. A few minutes after it quit, there were three aircraft with normal aircraft flashing lights headed east that were in a triangle shape, but with huge gaps in between them. These appeared to come from nowhere.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then the next night, 24 hours later at approximately 12:12 AM, I was driving home headed west when a bright light appeared from above for about a second and a half, not moving, then disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Both of these occurrences triggered a driveway chime in our house, that uses infrared to notify people coming through our driveway. My girlfriend was in the house at both times and said that was the exact time it went off. It would go off approximately at 11:39, 12:12, 12:39, and 1:08 sporadically. That week was the most active that it went off, and it slowly stopped ringing and now the driveway chime hasn&#39;t gone off for 2 weeks in the middle of the night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The only other logical explanation I&#39;ve been able to come up with is a high maneuverability aircraft that the government could be testing, and the lights we saw were the afterburners on the aircraft. However, I&#39;ve never heard of an aircraft that can turn almost on a dime going what appeared to be several hundred miles per hour (300-400+), though it was difficult to tell at what distance it was.<n>

I first thought it was a helicopter flying low, because it was flying at about the same speed one would be flying, but then realized the shape of the lights on the craft didn&#39;t match and it was flying in a strange fast to slow pace.  The lights were blinking whitish yellow and had one red blinking light at what seemed to be the tail of the craft. I was trying to think logically and and tried to convince myself it was some strange aircraft I had never seen until a second aircraft flew directly overhead.  This one was about 2-3 times the size of the first and seemed to be flying slightly lower than the first and had 5 or more light blue blinking lights.  It flew at about the same speed and disappeared over the tree line where I could no longer see it.  They were both heading south.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.  PD))<n>

(Note: it was pitch black, no visible stars, it had however started sprinkling.)  I was using my phone as a flash light, and my view finder on my phone kept trying to pick up every random object in the back yard, I was amazed at how well it was at seeing objects I could barely make out, so I turned it up towards the sky to see if it would pick up any stars that might be hiding behind clouds, and immediately my view finder focused and this bright dot appeared,<n> <n><n> <n><n> I looked up, saw nothing but pitch black, looked back down and watched the dot appear, and disappear, then right beside it two more would appear, when all 3 lights were on at the same time, it made a triangular shape, they stayed mostly white lights, but occasionally we saw them blink purple and blue   (Note: it seemed like these 3 particular lights were the same object, other parts of the sky would h! ave one or two, it was always changing) kinda like a airplanes lights blink,but there was no pattern at all to the lights, at first they were completely stationary just blinking on n off at random,and like I said, none of this was visible with the naked eye. I watched a few minutes trying to figure out what I was staring at, and called my son outside to look to make sure I wasn&#39;t just seeing things, when he confirmed my sanity was still intact, we immediately started trying to name off things that it possibly could be, and I kept coming up with nothing that I have ever seen before, so I switched my phone to video and started recording the lights, at this point, I&#39;m not gonna lie, I was freaking out, so I went in and woke up my gf, and made her come out and see, she grabbed her phone, and I started charging my video camera as well to hopefully catch it on there as well. This went on for over a hour, in several different locations in the sky, we walked around the house and do! wn the road a little, facing the opposite direction, and after! a min o r two these lights would appear. I called a friend of mine who ever since we were little was obsessed with airplanes, he worked at the airport and even built his own 1 person plane. I figured he would be able to tell me what I was more then likely seeing, after a few minutes of apologizing for it being so late, and for sounding like a crazy person, he had me send him the videos I recorded, I waited for him to watch them all, and when he called me back, he was baffled as well, he told me that airplanes can&#39;t remain stationary in the sky and that they have guidelines for certain color lights they can use, and he also said the fact that we couldn&#39;t visually see it without the camera lens told him  the light sources had to be infrared like on a tv remote. He told me he really had no clue what it was, he did however tell me that he also had seen something he couldn&#39;t explain a few months prior, but that he was able to visually see it with his naked eye. I don&#39;t know much about ai! r craft and if we all missed a obvious answer, I will gladly accept feeling like a moron.   Today, while browsing the internet I cane across this video about syria and the strange sightings that are currently being seen there, which made me think about how similar some of these videos I was seeing were, so i searched to see if anything strange had ever been seen in Virginia, and I found this website, and a youtube video that had been filmed the same day, in another part of Virginia, where the viewer had the same phenomenon of only being able to see it through his camera lens. So after watching that, I decided to come on here and share my experience and videos.  Ever since then I randomly scan the skies with my viewfinder when I&#39;m outside at night, and I have never incurred these strange lights since that night. So yeah, call me crazy lol but I dunno it was pretty nuts.<n>

They were traveling from east to west at an approximate speed of a conventional aircraft.  I first thought they were the wing tip lights found on military jets.  There were no anti collision lights operating and they were in a formation of two groups of two that with about five times as much distance between each group of two.  Each pair of lights was about a distance apart equal to the width of my index finger with my arm outstretched.  What made me believe they were military craft was the fact that they were so close to each other.  What was strange was there was no noise and I could not make out the outline of a fuselage.  What occurred to me later, upon reflecting on what I had seen was that they were each a separate object.  I realize the human mind must rationalize everything, so my mind had to rationalize them as being wing lights on a con! ventional aircraft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I first saw the lights above me and slightly to my right.  A few moments later out of the corner of my right eye I noticed another brighter object.  It was traveling toward the smaller lights from the East North East at a much faster speed.  This object was extremely bright compared to the other objects. It was about the size of a quarter inch ball bearing held at arms length.  The object was almost white in the center with a reddish cast at the outer edges.  It over took the other objects in a matter of a few seconds and came close to the group of lights on the right.  As it arrived at the group of lights on the right it made an incredible left turn that was almost a right angle.  When it negotiated the change in direction it intensified in brightness and it became a deeper color red, it also increased in speed at an astounding pace.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The larger object went south at an incredible speed and was out of my field of vision in about a second.  I must also explain that the southern horizon was not visible to me because it was obscured by my house and the other houses around me.  I therefore could not observe the object as it traversed the sky to the southern horizon.  The four objects proceeded west till they no longer visible to me; their speed remained the same through out the event.<n>

At that time I crab my camera phone and started to record the monitor while trying to track the objects at the same time.  Here is the video of the objects.  There were no visible lights from the naked eye in the sky.  These images are all from a thermo camera.<n>

A glowing green looking UFO which seems to have a blue spot light coming from it?  This was not seen with the naked eye.

It&#39;s no longer there!  I didn&#39;t expect that.  I thought it would have just moved higher in the sky, but it&#39;s completely gone.  It was NOT moving when we witnessed it. It looked like it was 30,000 feet in the air or even higher (which is why we thought maybe a star/planet) but it was in the southern sky and no visible planets are there this month.  Also, it was not a plane as it didn&#39;t appear to be moving and we watched it for a good 4-! 5 minutes straight.<n>

Rearview)) mirror me and my girl friend saw for about 30 seconds the exact same thing as video 1. Video 1 and two are not my videos but exactly what i have seen on two occasions.  Video two happened about 7 year ago in the same spot in las vegas.  I was driving home around dusk and i fixed on an object and it stood still for about 7 seconds started moving and then disappeared.  I will attach the two videos.  The videos are &#34;exactly what i saw&#34;.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had a physicist look at the videos and he believes them to be hoaxes.  That is a easy perspective to have from a computer.  I believe these videos deserve a second look. I will attach his E-Mail as well.  Just wanted to share.

On the short one from China I can’t help much – I don’t see anything in the images that gives me a clue as to what is happening.  It does appear that the shape of the object is constant throughout the video – at least to within the resolution of the video.  However, I would really like to know why the videographer called it UFO with digital FX – makes me wonder what the effects are.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On the other (lights in the Vegas night sky), I do have a few comments.  First, the entire clip is being taken with a video-capable camera on a pretty solid tripod, so it isn’t a case of someone pulling out their cell phone to video what they are seeing. Another thing that seems pretty clear is that there are a bunch of objects at a higher angle above ground, and a second, smaller bunch of objects closer to the horizon.  A third thing to note is that the top of the hotel at the right of the image is out of focus.  There is so little difference between focusing at infinity and focusing at, say, 300 feet that if the camera is recording sharp lights, they are probably rather close to the camera, rather than at a large to very large distance.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Finally, if you look closely where the various objects fade out on the left and the right, you can trace out a cone of light in the image. You can’t see the light, but it seems pretty clear that the objects are moving in and out of a cone of l! ight such as might be produced by a flashlight pointing straight up from the ground.  I don’t know just what the objects are (at first I thought clusters of balloons, but they would have to be pretty small to be consistent with the hotel being out of focus. However, I don’t have any hesitation calling this one a fake.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Hope these comments help out.

I could not hear it until it was directly overhead.

The sky is very clear and looks beautiful.  To our amazement we see four tiny lighted circles so far away that they look like stars.  However they are moving at a fast rate, in a straight line, one behind the other.  One set is moving South West towards North East of our location.  The other pair North to South of our location.  They did not fly as if programmed by computer, but as if piloted by a person from inside the craft.  I have never seen anything like it before.<n> <n><n> <n><n> P.S. We went outside around 3:30 this morning and the lights had been visible for about five minutes.<n>

Immediately out the window from in bed I saw a greenish flickering dim light, which would have seemed as if it were coming from the outside pot lights, if this section of the house had them. I couldn&#39;t see the sky. Then, all of a sudden it stopped.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I got up with my flashlight to check the house and see if the alarm was still set, and brother and mom had also been awoken and met in the living room.  Brother said he saw the sky and it looked something like Aurora Borealis.  The even must have lasted only 60 seconds or less, and it put the power out for an instant.  Fifteen minutes later, there were numerous emergency vehicles responding high priority to something up the road from us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I thought I might find some reference to the short-lived event online, but I haven&#39;t had any luck.<n>

And then after that it changed into a crescent shape and didnt do anything elts but sit in the sky at that spot for 10 more minutes.

It moved quickly before I could take a good look it was out of sight, I saw which direction it went so I followers went down the roads. a Couple minutes and stopped by an opened field I went out further into field away from light and looked for a good few minutes and saw nothing than right when I was about to leave I saw a flashing white light in the distance rich above the woods thats past the field.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It start getting bigger and brighter and closer and I again was closer than before, still couldn&#39;t identify the shape of the craft but I moved smoothly and quick and I thought I heard a faint hovering sound, eventually after stairing at it for good 2 minutes it flew out ve sight again I tried to follow it and find it but no luck this time.<n>

Saw lights next to a tower, at first i thought they might have been part of the tower and maybe I never noticed them before.  When i got closer I realized that it was some type of air craft.  At first it looked cigar shaped, not huge, maybe 30 ft wide.  4 LIGHTS seen from the front, they were red and white.  Object was right next to the tower, maybe 50 - 100 ft from the tower...the same height as the top of the tower.  Could see very well as I passed right by it that it was more of a triangle shape, maybe triangle more with rounded edges.  Saw 1 or 2 lights on the back.  Immediately called my husband.  As I continued down the road i could see in my mirrors, that the objected slowly headed south across road, then slowly headed back towards the tower.  I continued down the road about 2 miles to my house, seen it most of the way home, grabbed my husband went back out and couldn&#39;t see it anymore.  The only light on ! the tower is one white light.  Was Definantly not part of the tower. Did not hear any noise from the object.  But looked dark, like black.  Just 4 lights on the front when it looked cigar shaped, but after i passed and could see the bottom definantly looked more triangular.  No lights on the bottom, all on the sides of the craft.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I continued watching my movie when I saw the same &#39;moving light&#39; - it went up and then down but like at an angl (side way to the sky and then back to the ground) I then realy freaked out a bit and then went to my mom.  Before I said anything she asked did you also see that? I said yes there was like moving light and then joked about it being an &#39;orb&#39;. She said she had seen bright light against the wall outside and also thought it had been a torch perhaps but there was nobody outside, everyone was in the tv room.  I went back to my room looking outside but saw nothing.  After about an hour I saw the same thing again but havnt seen anything else so far - it is night time and there isn&#39;t really anything around my house that I could think can explain what I saw…  Does anyone think I&#39;! m just &amp;quot;seeing&amp;quot; things???<n>

After that the lights started changing in sequence from blue, red, green and yellow.  The disk was stationary at first and then it started rocking from side to side.

I work at a major international airport in the vicinity for airport operations on the airfield and have spent over seven years in the aviation and airport industry, so I know pretty well what an airplane or helicopter looks like flying at night.  This definitely didn’t look like either.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This red light was several miles away but clearly visible.  It pulsated very slowly, I would guess 5 times slower than an aircraft’s red beacon light, but it never faded or disappeared.  At times it would get brighter and almost to an amber color then back to red.  At one point it appeared that another smaller red light appeared just slightly above the main light but soon went away.  The light hovered in the same area for about a minute and a half just slowly moving left and right ever so slightly before finally starting to pick up speed and move toward the West where I lost sight of it behind the trees.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In total, the event lasted about 2 minutes.  I called my girlfriend over to the porch and she witnessed the light as well and suggested that it may be a planet or satellite, but this was not possible as there was cloud cover in the sky behind the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The rectangular shaped light panels were so bright and tonights overcast haze conspired to obscure it.  The objects &amp;quot;from west- to south&amp;quot; trajectory put  its position from my point of view to be roughly a mile and a half from 19th and Boulder Ave. I would suppose that it was hovering over the areas between 21st and 18th from west to east, and pikes peak avenue and the Highway 24 corridor from north to south.  I would guess that it was about 100- 150 ft. In altitude, slower than a plane, but faster than a chopper.  The object did not continue its west to east flight, it came down!  It was no helicopter!  It did not have the characteristic waver of a pitch change from forwa! rd to down, as it did this very quickly.  Thats it.<n>
4/14/13 21:30|Saylorsburg|PA|Light||Greenish- Blue light in the sky|5/15/13|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/097/S97194.html|249|ndxe201304| Greenish- Blue light in the sky<n> <n><n> <n><n> Last night somewhere in between 9:30 and 10:00 p.m. E.S.T., I was in my children&#39;s room on the second floor of my home laying down preparing to read stories. My eyes catching sight of something out the window were drawn to a greenish-blue colored light. I said to my boys , &amp;quot;do you see that?&amp;quot; As they responded, &amp;quot; see what?&amp;quot;, the greenish- blue light sped away. It was only seconds, two to four seconds that it was amidst my gaze.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The light was a large roundish shape. It was smaller than the moon but much larger than a star. From my position if I could estimate the size it appeared, it seemed relative to that of a large children&#39;s&#39; bouncy ball.  Seemingly upward of 10 feet above my 30 -40 foot tree line is where the light appeared. As my eyes faced north, it sped away going north. Lying down in the position and facing North, (the direction in which I saw the greenish-blue colored light), the distance from where I caught sight of it and where I lost sight of it, was seemingly only six inches apart.  As it sped away the round shape seemed more like a pear or tear drop shape. It was almost like lightning speed, how it disappeared so quickly from view.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Interestingly enough, I saw something similar a week or two ago. The light was also greenish- blue but it was traveling East. That time I was lying in my bed watching television. The time was somewhere between 9:00 - 11:30 p.m. E.S.T.  Just as before, my eyes caught site of a light in the sky.  Its distance covered the expanse of my backyard traveling east before disappearing from site. Now when I say disappear, it is NOT like watching a balloon that slowly leaves your site, it is NOT like a firework that fades as it falls. It disappears with a flash, very abruptly. In both sightings the light leaves with an abrupt flash.<n>

She reported an estimated 20-40 roughly circular, yellow-to-whitish lights close to the northern horizon and I could see as well through trees that still lacked foliage and were no more than 200-300 feet from me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The lights, larger than aircraft lights and slower had no flashing beacons.  They were not equidistant and were moving and moving east-to west and covered about 45 degrees from the northern horizon to the eastern.   Lights on the eastern horizon were brighter and closer together, perhaps due to perspective.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was a thin, transparent layer of alto-cirrus clouds through which I could see stars and a barely bit of remaining glow from the sun which had set.  Seemed to be just below that deck.  In minutes they had all disappeared, seemingly, a few at a time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Call to local police did not turn up any other reports.

4/14/13 20:30|Wasaga Beach (Canada)|ON|Unknown|4 hours|Double rack of lights over Georgian Bay|5/15/13|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/097/S97179.html|253|ndxe201304| Double rack of lights over Georgian Bay<n> <n><n> <n><n> April 14 2013 Just as the sun was going down my husband and I noticed some bright lights hanging stationary in the sky over Georgian Bay.  There were like 2 racks of lights, one slightly behind the other, suspended over the lake.  They would stay illuminated, then fade out to nothing, and nothing was in the sky -was still light at that time.  Too high for it to be a boat, and there was no boat anyways.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We decided to go down to the water&#39;s edge for a better look, by the time we got there, they blinked out.  Then as we were leaving, they blinked on again.   They&#39;ve been doing that for 4 hours.  Sometimes it&#39;s one rack,  then a second one, fainter,  for 15 minutes, then the faint one fades out, followed by the second more brilliant one, also fades out.  It was a mostly clear sky with some ribbon clouds at the horizon, but clear overhead.  Crescent moon was bright, as was I think Venus, or some star just off to the right of the moon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> One time the lights blinked out,  then when they blinked on they were in a different spot.  They don&#39;t move, it&#39;s like they are hovering stationary.  When they are illuminated, they appear to be pulsing, not a steady light.  Seems mostly a white light, very bright.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We thought at first it was a helicopter search team or something,  but helicopters would be moving not hangin stationary for 4 hours.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My husband filmed it for a few minutes before it blinked out.<n>

Then about 3 or 4 after the square shape.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We conitnued driving about a 1/4 mile and pulled into a Wawa, we could see the objects above the Wawa, we got out of the car and walked about 15 feet out into the parking lot to get a better view and they were gone. Completely gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I did take a picture with my phone, but my phone stinks so the pic is not that good, but you CAN see several of them !!<n>

No blinking lights and no noise.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After about 5 minutes I was so excited I got up on the railing of my friends deck to get a better look.  The intensity of the red got higher.  After about 10 minutes some trees got in the way and I could no longer see it. Im sure if the trees weren’t there I could have watched it longer.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date is approximate.  PD))<n>

City of Imperial Beach  I and several others witnessed three objects flying in the night sky.  The weather here has been cloudy and a coastal eddy or marine layer with drizzle all day since yesterday.  At around 8:00 pm I had just gotten home with the family.  I went outside to make a phone call on the front porch facing west, when I heard a boom sound; I started to speak to the person on the phone when out of nowhere a light appeared in the sky southwest of my location.  I was talking with the person on the phone when I told him I was seeing something strange in the sky.  I told him I would call back and try to film or photograph it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This First object appeared to by flying from south to north along the coast it originated over the ocean then disappeared from sight lasted approximately 5 min.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The second object did the exact same thing that is when I called my neighbors to come out and see this we had no clue as what it could be.  The object followed the same path but stayed in sight a little longer than the first one than it disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The third object appeared as soon as the other had disappeared originated around the same spot and flew the same path as the others but this one lasted the longest.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The objects where like fireballs very bright and red in color it was absolutely amazing my dog was freaking out and still is acting weird. I took photos and video. I am hoping that someone else had to have seen this along the coast near Imperial Beach or Coronado, CA, it was a sighting that lasted a long time in the sky.  Total time of sighting approx: 20 Minutes.<n>

I immediately noticed a bright read object in the shape of almost on of cowboy hat or one of those fancy fedora hats.  Maybe a saucer shape with a large dome on top.   Once on the main road they was clear skyline view were I noticed the object, again with red slights at the bottom and slight tint of white lights above the red glow.  I stopped in the road to observe object as it was hovering over the distant tree lines. Now with no point reference I can&#39;t be sure how high up it was hovering, but I could tell the distance from me was maybe between 5-10 miles in my line of vision.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After about 1 minute the object started moving towards N-NE I followed till I got to the stop sign where the object was even clearer to see, but only for a brief second.  The the road i take home I was almost simiar to the direction the object was heading which was a  orth direction. Now the road I was on goes thru a section of heavy tall pines trees but shorty after I regained sight of the object where it was looked to be heading over a local park and business center. I got as close I coud to see the object hovering, but I as got closer to the area where i determined the object to be, it jettison North at a high rate of speed. I continued to drive around the local roads but as came around the corner the object was gone, and few seconds later I was able to come to a open view of the skyline but the object was gone. The most interesting thing about the object was the shape and the disticnt bright red light that went around the circumference of the object. It was dead silent not a plane or a private drone. It covered to much space to be a drone, I have read some info on the new craze of private drones. This did not fit such description as it was far to big.<n>

There was no wind and no sound at all.  They seemed so close at times and at times i could see an outline under the flame looking balls.  The outline kind of looked like three giant sized fans conected together in a triangular pattern and facing downwards with the firie ball part just above one triangle end. they would move very close to each other and then apart again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I ran downstairs to grab my video camera and when i came back up they were gone. we watched open eyed for a few mins and all of a sudden they rose up from behind this big tree on the opposite side of our block.  OMG they were closer than ever.  my mom was freaking and my daughter age 13 was in awe, she just kept asking what are they.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I got some video, the best i could with what i have.

I witnessed eight orange lights to my north. The color was similar in nature to the orange lights used to illuminate roads near interchanges. I pulled the truck over about a mile from the Route 65 exit.  This afforded me a clear view across the valley to my north. The lights appeared to travel out of the north to the southeast in a loose trail formation with the lead light about one mile ahead of the other 7. I shut off the enhine and the radio. I did not hear any sound that would indicate rotors, propellors, or turbine engines. I am very accustomed to these sounds as I was a helicopter crewchief inthe Army and an aircraft technician for a number of years.  The lights faded from view one at a time (lead light first) before they had even gotten to the north end of the valley.  They did not display aircraft anti-collision lights, navigation lights, or landing lights.  The orange ! glow cast form these objects was constant (did not flicker, flash or change colors) until it faded. From the moment I first viewed these lights until the last one faded from view was about four minutes long.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Lat/Long of my position could not be obtained (didn&#39;t have my GPS). Lat/Long can be obtained as well as an asmuth to the location of the first light&#39;s location when it faded from view and the last light&#39;s location at the same time (the first faded from view before it entered the constallation Libra.<n>

I turned around and we saw four orange-red fire balls at first flying across,  from west to east.  They were flying in a straight line, then two went up and the other two went beneath and they formed like a square.   As we continued to watch shortly after there were three more and they flew toward the other four and they were all just hovering.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A helicopter came to investigate and as it got closer it started to rise toward the fireballs.  The first four at that time just dimmed out.  The helicopter turned toward the other three and went forward a bit.  The other three dimmed out as well.  Then we noticed another fireball about twice the size of the first seven coming from the west toward the helicopter.  At this time the helicopter turned to the east and left.   The larger fire ball slowed and began to move north bound and just zipped out of sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About 3 min. later my son and I heard some loud pops and two flares were shot in the direction were all the activity had been happening.   At no time did these fireballs make any sound that we could hear.  We live in the path where commercial airplanes pass on a regular basis, on their way to the airport.

Actual shape was not really visible. The object had red lights, which gave an idea of the shape.  If to look at the sequence of those red lights, you can assume that it is an arrowhead shape.  The red lights were not bright, you could see them just if to pay attention. It flew about 200 feet of the ground. It did not make any noise.  The approximate size was about one or two school buses.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We saw that object just for a few seconds,than it disappeared behind townhouses roofs. We live around 20-23 miles from Dulles International Airport, I know how the passenger and military aircrafts look like, it was not one of them.<n>

The followed the mountainside southerly toward us from the Holyoke Range south over the Chicopee River and then in two cases along the river east and out of sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It might even be fair to say they followed the Connecticut River southward to the Chicopee River and turned East around that point. The rivers are only a rough guide, they did not stay exactly on the rivers but rather it appeared there paths were roughly along those lines.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The average altitude is estimated to be 800 to1200 Feet overhead.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They maintained the same colors (shifting) and circular shape the entire time. The colors went from white to red and orange with the otter edge staying red while the center was what changed to white and orange and even into very dark red. We agreed the all looked like flares but were of course too large to be a flare and no flare could move in this type of controlled pattern time and time again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I did hit one with a laser and it appeared to stop momentarily but kept going.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We noticed after the first and second sightings they had a time interval, each sighting was about to 15 minutes in-between – roughly, we didn’t time them but it was approximate and the intervals were about equal.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The loops they made kept moving southerly progressively moving coming nearer and nearer to us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The first passes turned short of our area with pass’s number 5 and 6 directly overhead and number 7 was slightly south of our position.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

4/13/13 21:45|Garland|TX|Oval|10 minutes|Two lines of 5 to 6 ornage flickering craft moved in tandem non formation across sky.|5/15/13|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/097/S97172.html|271|ndxe201304| Two lines of 5 to 6 ornage flickering craft moved in tandem non formation across sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On April 13th at as close as I can determine at 9:45 pm traveling on George Bush Fwy in the Garland city limits near the intersection of Garland Ave. I saw a line of lights traveling in a semi formation. There were 5 to 6 objects traveling together in a random line at different distances from each other. They were not traveling in a close organized formation but were all traveling together in the same direction coming across in front of my westerly driving direction moving in a line on a North by Northwesterly direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I pulled the car over and attempted to get my Galaxy S3 out and trained on them to begin videoing. Unfortunately the last setting on my camera had the camera facing me. By the time I adjusted the camera to face away and set to video the objects they had turned a more Westerly direction and moving away from me. The caught my attention as unusual because they appeared to be orange and flickering as a constant light source. They did not have the red and white normal aircraft lights blinking at a consistent way. The light they emitted gave the appearance of a flickering flame. This is barely distinguishable in the video I did get but it is discernible if you know that&#39;s what I saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Unfortunately also my lack of use of the video application on my phone also affected what I got, because it was on when I thought was off, and off when I thought it was on. I did not successfully capture any video on the first line of objects as they moved away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had been sail racing the whole day so I was well aware the wind was still about 8 to 10 miles per hour coming from the South maybe slightly Southeasterly. The objects seemed to by flying similar to the height and speed of helicopters. So they were very low seeming for aircraft but higher than a typical traffic or police copter, and fairly fast similar to the speed of a fast moving helicopter such as care flight as it would pass over.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I watched the line move away over the city of Plano I turned to get in the car and amazingly another line of objects of the speed, height and constant orange flickering nature were heading directly in my direction. Again there were 5 to 6 or maybe more in the group. They were traveling Southwesterly. This is when I struggled to get my video going again and thought it was on when it was off and off when it was on. As one passed directly over me the underside of one of the objects appeared oval as if the light was refracted as a lens would do. The distinct sound of helicopters was not present as they are obviously very loud and discernible but again this is exactly the height and speed it seemed fast moving high flying helicopters would be moving. It is possible that they could have been larger and higher and just gave the feeling this is the altitude they were flying but I&#39;m pretty certain of my perception. It did seem there was engine noise above the traffic noise but sub! tle and not so obvious.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The video I did capture was by accident and you can see the orange flickering effect somewhat out of focus and a couple times focus in and appear white and turn two distinct dots. Visually they never appeared white to me but the video does. The other interesting thing about the colors is that two distinct separate flying objects change color in synchronization. Therefore the color change could be attributed to the low quality camera phone video.. The video I did get was the last one I attempted so it was of the second line moving away from me and probably about already 4 to 5 miles away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am a Real Estate Broker business Owner in Dallas, Texas<n>

These solid, &#34;street light&#34; colored lights looked higher than any airplane but way lower than any star.  I looked on youtube for something similar and found the same lights in illinois, I think fla, and also a post from 60 miles north of fresno.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A few weks later i found the exact same lights seen the same day in new zealand.<n>

I immediately saw what appeared to be a very bright star, somewhat orange-red in color, and it seemed to pulsate.  It was bright enough to have a penumbra around it.  It was very high in the sky, but slightly to the north-east.  I honestly thought that a very intense star had suddenly appeared in the sky.  It was impossible to miss.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I got my wife so she could see it.  By the time she came outside, it seemed like it was slightly less bright and a little smaller, but still definitely too big to be a star.  I took a picture with my Samsung Galaxy S, but it doesn&#39;t do it justice.  We both watched it for a minute more.  She wondered out loud if it was slowly moving.  If it was, it was going up and straight away from us, because it did vanish out of sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Afterward, we tried to rationalize what we had seen.  She speculated it might be one of those sky lanterns that someone set off.  I have seen a flaming meteorites before, and this was not that.  I speculated that maybe what we saw was a rocket launch with the flame going away from us.  I looked online and asked a bunch of people whether they heard anything.  No one has.  I have never seen anything like this.  There has to be others who saw it.<n>

Parachuters!,&#34; I yelled, noticing two bright white spots just hanging in the sky, seeming to drift around.  The sky was a deep blue with just one large wispy feather-like cloud stretching from over our heads to the horizon.  Visibility was excellent.<n> <n><n> <n><n> One of my boys pointed out a third object.  We watched for a while as they moved further away, maybe higher, couldn&#39;t tell. I am terrible at judging heights, so I will not try to guess their altitude.  Two of them were in the same general area.  One was off to the northeast of the others.  My husband pointed out to the boys that these couldn&#39;t be parachuters because they were not coming down.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then I decided they weren&#39;t going to vanish because they weren&#39;t darting around or just staying still like ufos are often reported to do.  I though! t they must be weather balloons. I ran inside, came back out with the binoculars and couldn&#39;t get an eye on them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They finally got too far away to see.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I gave up, went in for water and ate a little snack, came back and there was another one, or one came back, just as low as when I first spotted them.  This time I supported my elbows on the trunk of my car and got a good look through the binoculars.  I watched this thing for about five minutes.  Maybe more.  There were three large spheres all apparently connected, and they were rotating, not like those balloon arches do that people think are space worms or whatever.  This was steady as clockwork. It was like the hand of a clock going around but the hand was made of spheres.  It did this the entire time I was watching.  For a while they were roating vertically, then turned horizontal. Its movement appeared to me to not be subject to the wind.  It was steadily sailing to the east with no variation in direction.  At one point, I don&#39;t k! now if it was the light reflecting or my eyes, but they had a ! rainbowi sh glow on the edges.  The object or objects appeared white.  They did seem to be connected. I watched until it got too small to see.<n>

As we looked at it floating a thousand or so feet to the northeast, we noticed a very faint light or a white abject that had to be at least 30 thousand feet in the sky changing shapes and directions.  It would have been the size of a star or maybe the size of Venus if the stars were out, maybe a little larger as I could tell there was movement.  It was directly above and beyond the bag and very hard to see and would not have noticed it otherwise.  The object was moving in a general SE direction but would take slight jumps up down and back and forward.  The movements were not smooth and very abrupt jaunts going back in the direction it came and then seeming to stop and then move on.  The object was either spinning and a shinny side was catching the sun or there was a light flashing. We could not ! tell. We watched the object for about 5 minutes and then lost site of it as we looked away. In those five minutes it would have traveled from the 12 o clock position to the three o clock position toward the sun.  If there was sound we could not tell as we were on a busy street.  There was a slight breeze and the temperature was about 66 degrees with almost totally clear skies.  There was not vapor trail left by the object.  I was able to view the object a little better with my sun glasses on as did my friend and we both had polarized sun glasses.<n>

The lights were organized in rows of three forming a W shape.  I live right next to the air force base and see and hear planes and military planes flying over my house all the time! This made no noise and was close enough to my house that if it had been a plane it would have shook it.

While thus engaged, I spotted a phenomenon 10 degrees north of and about the same altitude (on the celestial sphere) as the moon and pointing to it, asked my wife if she saw it too.  She answered in the affirmative.  We observed five rather subdued lights that appeared to be approaching us in a tight formation (angular separation of the formation was estimated at approximately 3-5 degrees) which in approximately 5 seconds moved across our line of sight to the north of us, then quickly disappeared off to the northeast, the whole sighting lasting no longer than 20 seconds.  The five lights maintained their tight formation throughout our observation though they changed their position relative to one another a couple of times while we observed them.  The lights were not at any time occulted by any terrestrial objects.  The individual lights appeared to be chevron shaped—definitely not point sources nor spheres.  The actual (not observational) altitude of the lights was impossible to estimate but our instincts suggested they were fairly close to the ground.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We heard nothing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is my first sighting of what some might describe as a UFO  •	Do I believe in UFOs?

Looked like stars clearly seen in the daylight if looking in that area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They appeared to be stationary.  Four points of light were in close proximity in a square shape, the other four were lower in the sky but in the same area.  The bottom 4 points of light were well spaced apart.  I observed for 10 minutes. In the first 5 mins that I observed they appeared to be stationary then after that I realised they were moving slowly towards the south west.  During that time I noticed the top four lights became dull and then bright (back to original brightness)  As this happened the top four (formation) changed shape from square to a triangle shape. As I continue to observe, the 8 points of light continued to slowly move from overhead towards the southwest and continued into the lighter blue sky until they could no longer be seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

It glided through the sky and &amp;quot;slowed&amp;quot; its speed for about 3 seconds and then immediately rocketed off into the night sky. I am reporting from Front Royal,Va and moved here about 8 months ago.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Since December of 2012 I personally along with a few neighbors have witnessed numerous sightings of UFO&#39;s. I am not sure if this is a &amp;quot;Hot Spot&amp;quot; or the next Nome,but I believe it warrants an investigation. When I say numerous I mean literally upwards of 6 in the last few weeks. These are naked eye sightings NOT to be confused with airplanes because we get a lot of that activity and are more than familiar with airplanes flying overhead. I will most certainly be documenting the next sightings because there will be more I&#39;m sure.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides little contact information.

(The sensors react to the reflections of the water and so on) any way, that was what I was doing in the back of my villa.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Mindless tinkering.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After I had finished I went back inside and checked over all the pictures because it wasn&#39;t a bad shot and I wanted to keep it.  That&#39;s when I discovered this anomaly on one of my pictures. I&#39;ve observed it as much as I can and it looks as if it was in the background, behind the tree&#39;s in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Not a bug of any kind that I&#39;ve seen as most are solid black or bright yellow.  Also, out of all the other shots I had taken, this was the only one with something different in it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Unfortunately I didn&#39;t see it with my own eyes, I only noticed it once the picture was taken.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Didn&#39;t even see it on the view finder. (1080p screen at that).   There are plenty of examples in the picture to gauge a size, I&#39;m no professional but it looks pretty big but It&#39;s most defiantly in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The coloration of the object and the fact one of the leaves is covering the left UFO in the picture.  Same with the exit UFO on the right.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was located at the time on a very secluded island in the middle of the Indian Ocean.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have another picture in of the same shot, different time to compare against.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The island itself is a quiet one and I have been there three times for the past three years. This last time was the quietest of all.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Usually there is a bird that chants its mating call, similar to the island name, &#39;meeru!&#39;  Barely heard it this year.<n>

We are in the city and don&#39;t see many stars here so it was clearly something different.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It appeared to be four stars grouped together but it moving very fast.  I went in the house and got my husband and camera with video on it and went back outside with him.  I started filming it, zooming in you could then see it was like two Z shapes attached at the center.  It was moving in an orb manner emitting a yellow light- as if a centrifuge force.  It was huge!

Triangle one got aggressive and shot at the white ball one until it left.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was watching TV show and my son played video games in his room.  I don’t know if this matters, but it’s what prompted me to see go outside so I need to tell you that I am a spiritual medium (a person who can interact with spirits from other dimensions).<n> <n><n> <n><n> I heard a voice say go to the back door and not to turn on the porch light. I thought it was an odd request, but nothing surprises me in my profession.  My home backs up to a side street, but there are no street lights anywhere near so it’s very dark at night.  I stepped onto my back patio and everything seemed unusually quiet for our neighborhood.  There were no dogs barking around me or anything.  I could see the stars and moon clearly.  There were no clouds around us either.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In the distance I could see what looked like a white ball thing moving around.  My son asked me what I was doing and decided to stay outside with me watching as I pointed out the white ball object moving around in the sky.  I saw something similar a few summers ago when I was sitting outside by my fire-pit late at night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My son pointed straight up and I saw something larger hovering over our house. It was dark and larger, resembled a triangle.  It had an orange light on the bottom so I thought maybe it was a helicopter or airplane.  The object moved vertically which I thought was really strange.  What caught my attention was that it did not make any noise.  It was completely silent so I knew it wasn’t a plane or helicopter.  It was fairly high above our house, but as we stood and watched it came closer and we could clearly see an orange flame on the bottom and that’s when I realized this thing was larger than I thought.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There were two people walking behind my house who didn’t know we were outside. I heard one ask the other what that was in the sky.  As they passed I heard a man say “I don’t know!”   My son grabbed my camera and we tried to get a photo but I couldn’t zoom in enough to really make out anything. It was blurry so I stopped trying to photograph it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My 15 year old son said it looked like something out of Star Wars.  We watched it for 20 minutes and the white ball thing was still there moving closer when suddenly a red light like you would see from Star Wars shot out of the darker object towards the white ball thing! My son and I were really freaked out as a few more shots were fired.  I felt like we were witnessing UFO’s fighting one another.  The white ball thing zipped out of sight after that.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The dark object hovered for another 20 minutes and we could not take our eyes off it after seeing that. It moved up and down very slow similar to how hot air balloons move.  Then it floated up so far it was completely out of our sight. My son kept asking me what that was. I told him it had to be a UFO.  We were both so excited and amazed by what we saw that we couldn’t go to bed.  My son must have been scared because he wouldn’t sleep in his room alone for the next few nights.  I admit that once I comprehended what we witnessed I was very unnerved by it.  I felt vulnerable like this thing was going to come get me or something.  It takes a lot to freak me out since I talk to spirits for a living.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then maybe from my fear of seeing this I had a dream that I was in an alien ship naked with some type of helmet on my head, and my arms were being restrained.  There were wires or tubes hooked all over my body.  I became aware and started yelling for them to let me go.  I couldn’t really remember much of anything else. I question to this day if that was just a dream.  I really hope so.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My parents live exactly one mile from me.  I did not mention anything about the UFO to anyone.  My parents started telling me that when they were diving home a week ago on Thursday night they saw something weird in the sky.  I asked what time. It was the same time we were outside watching!  That makes three other people besides me in our family and two strangers that witnessed this thing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

4/11/13 08:50|Torrance|CA|Light|15 minutes|3 to 5 orange lights hovering in night sky and then slowly rising and moving into clouds in a cyclic pattern.|5/15/13|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/097/S97128.html|301|ndxe201304| 3 to 5 orange lights hovering in night sky and then slowly rising and moving into clouds in a cyclic pattern<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was riding my bike home from tennis and stopped by Taco Bell to get something to eat at about 8.45 in the evening on April 11th 2013 in South Torrance, CA.  As I was leaving Taco Bell on my bike I noticed an orange object hovering in the sky to the south at about an angle of 45 degrees to me.  It seemed fairly close, and I would guess within a mile.  It was hovering over the hills just south of Pacific Coast Highway..  It was unusual I thought so I stopped riding my bike and began to watch it.  It stayed stationary for approximately a minute when it began to move slowly upwards into the sky which was slightly cloudy.  It got fainter as it got higher into the clouds until it was about to disappear.  During this rise I noticed a what I thought at the time was a plane flying low into view in the same general area off to the right.  As it got closer I realized it had the same coloration of the previous object.  An orange perhaps slightly red color.  it proce! eded to the same spot in the sky that the previous object had hovered and stayed there for perhaps a minute or so.  There were no blinking lights on either of these objects, just an orange color the shape of which I couldn&#39;t make out.  (I didn&#39;t have any glasses on which would have helped me to see them more clearly)  This second object too began to rise higher into the sky and about this time 2 more object flew into view to the lower right and proceed to the same spot in which the first two had hovered, and they too hovered in that spot for several minutes, both slowly moving while hovering.  These eventually disappeared also.  And I proceeded the remaining half mile to my apartments down the street.  I looked back before heading in, and saw another orange light of the same type in the same general area and watched it for about 5 minutes.  A person walked by as I was watching and asked me if I saw it too, and I said I did.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I can only speculate on what I saw, but it is very intriguing and I hope to get more information on this sighting.  I at first thought it could be a hot air balloon, but then when it moved upwards into the clouds and others flew into the area I ruled this out. The other normal explanation I have thought of is that perhaps they were a group of people flying helicopters in a cyclic pattern for some unknown reason (Perhaps to simulate a UFO event).  I didn&#39;t see any red or green blinking lights in the objects, and I am not sure if I saw any white lights.  It was predominantly orange.  I do not remember hearing any noise coming from that direction, though I am not sure if I would have been close enough or not to hear any if they were helicopters.   When I got back to the hot tub at the apartment right after the sightings, I asked if any one else had seen them an one man in the hot tub said he had seen an orange object in the sky about 10 minutes earlier. The whole sighting ! laster perhaps 15 minutes.  There were at least 3 objects involved in this sighting and as many as 5.  I saw 3 at one time after the first disappeared, and the fifth 5 minutes later.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

They turned the lights on it was burning me through the glass and the cross of seletape i had on the window melted on hard.  They then entered my house and i grabbed one of the alien looking feinds around the neck it was indeed a suit of sorts because it felt like a normal width for a neck, about seven inches-however it looked like the neck was two inches.

He was about a minute to 90 seconds behind me.  The time was about 9:12 p.m. PDT.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Despite fairly heavy traffic around me, I noticed a very fast-moving object heading from north to south above the eastern horizon.  It was just above treetops from my view.  It was not fiery or bright like a meteorite, and it was far too fast to be any kind of aircraft.  It glowed enough to be visible, obviously, and was dull blue-gray.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The size was very hard to judge, since I don&#39;t know how far away it was.  Compared to the planets, it was larger than Venus but not bright.  It did not leave a trail.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Its path was straight.  I lost sight of it after perhaps 3 or 4 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My husband had a clearer view from a higher point on the freeway.  He observed the object for 4 to 5 seconds before it disappeared on the horizon.  His impression of it was exactly the same as mine, the dull gray-blue, the flat trajectory.   He said it might have appeared smaller in size when it disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On land, from the point where he first noticed it to where it vanished is a distance of about 15 miles.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I pulled off the freeway and parked to watch the sky, and he pulled in a minute later.  I saw nothing else unusual.   He was glad I had seen the object, too, so I didn’t dismiss it as a light reflected in his car’s windshield.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have not been able to find anything on the web about similar sightings at that time.<n>

We arrived around 6. We sat down at the beach and drank coffee and tea and were talking about boats as we were looking around.  I was the first to notice what we saw. I could see the Seattle center area and space needle and that above it there were many white or off white things flying around. The things flew irregularly, they took sharp turns, while gaining altitude. Sometimes they would briefly remain still, but I couldn&#39;t tell if it was because they were moving towards/away from me, or remaining in place.  The objects would disappear frequently too, every 10-25 seconds.  Couldn&#39;t tell if it was because of clouds. My girlfriend could also see all of this.  First thing my roommate said to me when I woke up came to mind. &amp;quot;Its windy today&amp;quot; he said so I thought and told my girlfriend, &#34;They must be birds caught in the wind.&#34;  At the beach many birds were flying.  I could see some birds more on our side of the water, flying.  The birds were just about the same size as the more distant objects, all the way across the water by the science center/key arena area, in relation to my location at alkai.  Not sure if there were any events going on, I tried to find some online with my phone but found nothing. All the time about 15 minutes pass, after my eyes begin to become tired I decide to stop looking for only about a minute as my girlfriend and I continued to talk.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Roughly a minute later we both look back to search for another few minutes but don&#39;t see the objects anymore. We left the beach 10 minutes afterwards and went home. I&#39;ve looked online and found no reports so far.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My girlfriend is 20 years old, she was born out of the country and has lived in Seattle a year now and currently works at the airport she came in from. I am 20 years old, and was born on Capitol Hill in Seattle. I am a cook/worker at Seattle Fish Company, not far from the Beach we were at.<n>

So, as usual, I looked up and noticed a plane leaving a trail and then I looked back down, but did a very quick double-take because I subconsciously noticed something odd.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I saw two spherical objects in the sky, approximately 800 feet or so off the ground, flying side-by-side, heading north by northeast.  As I walked along, I kept looking up and following them.  They were over Kappy&#39;s Liquors on route 16 by the time I got to the 16/28 intersection.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The light changed and I needed to move, so I did and when I looked up again, they were gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I observed them a good 10 minutes and was in shock that no one else looked up as they saw me walking along and staring into the sky.  I&#39;ve seen UFOs before, but this is the first time I&#39;ve EVER spotted them in daylight, much less at noon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;ve fought with myself over whether or not to report this with UFOCenter, but right now... I just feel I need to.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Description: -- Round, could not determine approximate size.<n> <n><n> <n><n> -- They were ~800 feet off the ground, about 100 feet apart, staggered formation.<n> <n><n> <n><n> -- They were a dull white color, but seemed to be sort of metallic.<n> <n><n> <n><n> -- They were moving steadily, but not very quickly. Maybe 30mph or so as I was observing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I apologize for not having any pictures or video.  I was just in so much awe that I was seeing them at that particular time of day, that I was more concerned with seeing if anyone else had noticed them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;ve only told two other people because, well, you know how people react when you tell them this sort of thing.<n>

Ok I decided to write down what me and my roommate saw last night anyways because it was an eye opening experience. I was inside last night at about 12:57 cooking when my roommate stepped out to smoke a cigarette.  About three minutes later he rushed inside and yelled for me to come out. i rushed outside and looked up.  What I saw was about 25-30 round circular lights all bunched together very closely.  Almost looked like a swarm of bees they were so close together.  The lights were right above cloud level but moving north at a very high rate of speed.  I watched the crafts all form into an arrow righ! t when I saw them first and I could tell that each light was a separate craft.  I observed the lights for about a minute as they moved out of my eye range.<n>

It appeared to be at least a couple of miles away.  Given the number of aircraft in the skies normally, we were wary to assume it was a UFO as we have had false alarms before.  However, this orb was at least three times brighter than even airliner headlamps, and did not dim, twinkle, or flash despite changing directions several times.  We could not specify exactly where it was over, but it seemed to be near the Seal Beach Naval Weapons Station or the Los Alamitos Joint Forces Training Base/Airfield.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The orb seemed to float around lazily, then began to slowly make its way north.  We lost sight of it behind a house for approximately 2-3 seconds.  Once we realized it had vanished, I pulled to the side of the road to get out and look for it.  It was no where to be seen despite being able to see air traffic against the hills 12 miles to the north and ten miles south to the coast.  A couple of seconds later a blackhawk helicopter flew by overhead speeding in the direction of the light not in the direction of the airfield.  (I say speeding because I&#39;ve seen quite a few flying away and toward the airfield and this one was MUCH louder and flew by overhead much faster than usual.)<n>

4/9/13 21:50|Columbus|OH|Rectangle|5 minutes|Giant rectangular craft with cloaking technology witnessed|5/15/13|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/097/S97053.html|313|ndxe201304| Giant rectangular craft with cloaking technology witnessed<n> <n><n> <n><n> Tuesday, April the 9th, 2013<n> <n><n> <n><n> Around 945-950 PM, I was sitting on my back porch with my mother when our dogs alerted us to a disturbance.  I walked outside of the porch and after looking around the house and only finding a slow moving truck cruising down the street I headed back to the porch.  The sky is very clear tonight and the temperature is nice so I was stargazing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In the southwestern sky I saw three bright white lights very brightly flickering.  Immediately I called for my mother and she quickly joined me in viewing these lights.  They were arranged in a triangular pattern with one of the lights pointed in the direction of north and the two others being relatively close together in the rear.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I then noticed that they were moving very quickly in straight lines.  The movement was far to fast to be an aircraft as it was immediate.  It appeared that the lights were defining the edge line of the craft.  It was completely silent and moved at the speed of a typical jet.  It was traveling south*west to north. As it moved another light appeared and the size of the craft was plain to distinguish from the rest of the sky.  However, the object was exactly the same color as the night sky. It was like a perfect reflection; it was as if it was invisible.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I watched it move and watched the lights move back and worth I could see that it appeared like a gian! t rectangular panel.  The size of the craft was massive. It was only possible to know that the lights belonged to only one craft because as it moved it blotted out stars in the area between the lights.  It continued north (towards Wright Patterson AFB) and as it went further from my location it was possible to hear the sound of its engine.  It was the sound of a jet engine.  This was comforting, as it allowed me to have no fear that this craft was anything otherworldly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My mother and I are medical professionals.<n>

The object flew silently starting from Russian Hill - 346° degrees North traveling NorthEast 24° NorthEast towards they he Lincoln highway then changed direction back 10° North to Russian hill and changed back to it&#39;s original course of 24° NorthEast, then disappearing behind the &#39;One Thousand Green&#39; Apartment building.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This al took place in less than 30 seconds!  The flight speed was very fast, helicopters and airplanes in that distance cannot maneuver changes in opposite directions like that as fast.  Especially with how unbelievably silent it was!  I was approximately 1 mile away from the object, in which that distance I would normally be able to hear any sound coming from any aircraft.<n>

We paused to watch a helicopter leaving from the Cottage hospital heli pad.  In the past week or so many different agencies have been making landings, more than normal.  I assume they are practice runs for the pilots.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The helicopter passed out of site towards the south.  I turned around and looked up (I like to look at the stars) when a very fast completely silent object with one dim white light on the bottom passed over heading west.  I got excited and was yelling at my friend to look up.  I pointed towards it and it faded into the night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I was asking if my friend had seen it, another very fast completely silent object with 2 dim white lights one in the front and one in back passed overhead in the same direction and speed as the other object.  I yelled at my friend to look, and again it was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A few moments later I heard the sound of a helicopter coming from the east,  It soon came into view.  Much more slowly than the other 2 objects it passed overhead in the exact same direction as the two strange objects.  Their were many lights on the helicopter just like all the aircraft we see at night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had seen a silhouette of the two unidentified objects, but the shape was vague.  The two objects were different somehow (one with one light and the other with 2)   Yet they were obviously the same. Vandenberg airforce base is a one hour car ride in the same direction the objects were travelling.<n>

When suddenly we observed a amber ball of light moving across the sky slowly at a constant speed.  It was the same orange color as the old orange monochrome computer screens from the 90&#39;s.  It was coming from the Northeast and heading South.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When it started moving south it slowed down as one plane flew past it. It looked like the the amber object was going to hit the approaching plane.  Then it changed direction slightly going southeast.  As we saw it traveling Southeast it faded out and then got brighter again.  After it brightened it dimmed out immediately and vanished from the sky in about 1.5 seconds.  No sound came from this orange light in the sky.  It did move across the sky about the same speed as an airplane when we first saw it.  If i held my arm out with my thumb extended, my thumb would cover the object.  The orange object did not flicker and was constant! during the motion.  It can be described as glowing versus flickering or twinkling.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We have no idea what we witnessed but it was something we never seen before.  From this observation it was a clear night with no wind whatsoever.  We tried to rule it out as a plane but it did not have any flashing lights and did not have any sound.  It could have been a Chinese lantern however it seemed like it was moving too fast and the change in direction caught us by surprise.  I wanted to capture this on my cell phone but it was too dark to record video.  I also had serious doubts that it was a UFO until it disappeared and the fact it changed directions.  I can&#39;t figure out what we observed, but it all got our attention.<n>

I was on Rte 6A headign east when I noticed a bright, luminescent object with red lights around the center sitting stationary up in the sky above a gas station at the corner of Rte. 6A and Old Bass River Rd.  The reason why I noticed it was because if was as bright as those LED headlights that cars have now-very bright with a bluish/greenish tinge.  I slowed and then saw the red lights around the center. I couldn&#39;t tell if they were moving, but they were bright as well.  This thing just was sitting there.  If I had to estimate size, it would be the size of those tiny, baby Le Seur peas held at arms length.  I started to pull over by the Fire Station ob Old Bass River Rd. to grab my camera on the seat next to me, but before I could, this thing quickly moved off to the east towards Brewster, MA.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I would say that anyone driving east on Rte. 6A would have seen this because it was so bright and stationary, then woosh! Sped away!<n>

But then it moved in a straight line and moved quicker.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was like a oval in shape from where I could see it but it had a indent on the side.  The object was about 3 times the size of one of the birds in the flock nearby.  The object was black as seen under a blue afternoon sky.  The object headed east from the sighting area.<n>

The weather has been stormy.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I was watching the long stretch of Hwy 36 in front of me, between Smith Center and Lebanon, there was this disk of yellow light that appeared to almost fly into my windshield.  It was as if someone had thrown a glowing Frisbee at my car.  It came at a diagonal angle and flew up and over the hood and windshield on the driver side, inches from the car.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was going about 70 miles per hour, so it happened really fast.  I even ducked because I thought it might hit me.  It was about 5-7 inches in diameter, and appeared to be a disk, although it could have been more spherical.  It was as if it was made of yellow light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A couple of miles down the road, there were smoldering remains of a barn or large building that had just burned down.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was no sign of any other people anywhere around it, so I thought them odd coincidences.<n>

They both replied, “Yes”. I pulled over about 30 feet from where I first saw them and exited my vehicle. I was still talking on the phone with my Dad.  I was telling him about these UFOs.  He said they were probably big birds reflecting light.  I know they were not birds. Birds fly with the point of the V in front. These UFOs were traveling toward the open end of the V, or west bound. There were seven individual lights.  There were five on the top row and two on the bottom.  They were moving very slowly. Eventually they faded out of sight one by one.  I waited to ! see if more would come back or to see what would happen. Two more rose from the tree line, flickered and then vanished.  My Dad still says they were large birds. I disagree. I do not know if anyone else saw these.  Thank you for your attention in this matter.<n>

It flew at a constant speed and left no chem-trail behind it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 6 minutes later another cylinder shaped craft flew the exact same flight path as the first followed closely by a 3rd object.  I was terrified they were missiles but obviously they were not.<n>

The edited one I keep within my images files.  The pictured object was much closer than three other, can be seen in the picture too but as curved shapes in white bright colors.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Since I was taking picture from the van, I do not know if other people noticed about those strange objects.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What can be seen clearly is two large spot lights below other illuminated items.<n>

As I was feeding them I noticed a very bright light that resembled a star sitting just west of my house.  I jokingly called out to my brother, “hey check it out the star of Bethlehem is over the house!”  When he came outside to see it we were discussing what it could be, possibly a planet or a large star when the object slowly started to move.  I quickly pulled out my phone and started recording for almost a full minute.  I have a good smart phone and I began to review the video I had just taken while the object continued at a snails pace in a northeast direction.  The video was completely black sky, which I found to be unusual considering how large and bright the object was.  The object then began to pick up speed and in my frustration I snapped a photo since my video was less than remarkable.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We continued to watch it fly and as a helicopter approached from the east heading west (the object was very high compared to the position of the helicopter) the object quickly dimmed its light.  It could still be seen as a tiny speck of light which quickly disappeared in seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My brother and I were still talking about how strange it was when I remembered that I had taken a picture.  At first glance it looked like I had gotten nothing, but when I zoomed in and cropped the picture several times there is definitely something there.  It is the object we had observed; only the picture captured the object differently than we had seen with our eyes.  We had seen it as a very large bright light and in the picture it kind of looks like a grey glow worm with eyes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There are always airplanes that fly over the house but this was not an airplane or helicopter or anything I’ve seen relative to our technological capabilities.  I’m not sure how long it had been stationary prior to me going outside and spotting it but it definitely was something remarkable that my brother and I won’t soon forget….<n>

I noticed a cluster of strobe lights 1 red, 1 blue, &amp; 1 white, the strobes were flashing very quickly (about 5-10Hz frequency) but not in any cadence with each other.  I could not see any details of the UFO, it was very far off in the distance, atleast 5 miles, I just saw the 3 strobes.  The strobes did not move in position relative to each other, they appeared to be of the same body.  I watched this object on and off for about 90 minutes and it did not move. I attempted to find it in a telescope but was unable before the sunrise washed it out. I have not searched for it again as of yet. What did I see? There may be a simple answer but I never saw anything like this before.<n>

The sky was heavily overcast and it was raining at the time; no stars of any kind were visible in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It moved slowly like a plane, but the light was too bright and the wrong color to have been one.  As I watched it move, it began to “shed” and trail red/orange light (such as a rocket or “willow” style firework).  It continued to move at the same speed, but with more sloughing off and trailing of red/orange light until it finally disappeared.<n>

It first appeared to be stationary, but when I averted my eyes for a second and looked back it was moving to its right, my left, in a NW direction, almost over my house.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My observation lasted approximately 1 minute.  My gut feeling is it was 200 to 300 feet in altitude and an air speed slower than an Ultra Lite aircraft, although, I have no way to really know.  There was no air traffic observed at the time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was no structure connected to the light and it was as bright and unchanged going as it was coming. It made no sound.  The night was silent, in fact, it was one of those nights you have every once in a while where you suddenly realize the silence was almost deafening.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I didn’t notice the red illumination reflecting off anything in the yard or on the porch during the entire sighting.  It seemed to be self-illuminated. There were no other lights connected to it or around it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It continued NW until obscured by the top of trees.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I failed to report some previous sightings from years ago, but, thanks to my brother Scott’s encouragement I’m reporting this one.<n>

I witnessed these objects at the La Quinta Inn in Slidell. La.  I was in Slidell for work purposes.  There were two other persons who witnessed these objects as well.  One was a man also staying there for work purposes.  The other was a female hotel clerk. Upon talking to her about these objects I was informed that a UFO hunter group was in town a month prior for same objects. except those objects were white lights.  I never called anyone but asked repeatedly in video for someone to call.  I do not live there and I know there is a naval Air Force base not far from where I was at I just assumed maybe military stuff going on.<n>

4/6/13 22:30|Brampton (Canada)|ON|Light|30 minutes|2 amber lights moving slowly over Ontario sky.|5/15/13|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/096/S96998.html|348|ndxe201304| 2 amber lights moving slowly over Ontario sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I went outside for a cigarette and noticed 2 lights flying in sync coming from the south east and moving towards the northwest. The objects both had amber lights. They were too close together to be two seperate airplanes and too far apart to be a single aircraft. They moved slowly across the sky and no engine noise was heard.  The sky was overcast at the time of the sighting.  As they passed one of the objects had moved ahead and the other moved very slow.  At this time the trailing objects lights were not visible but I could see a silouette of the vehicle from the the city lights.  It was shaped almost like a disc. A craft I have never seen before.   As it disappeared I ran in to tell my wife what I saw and she thought I was crazy.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We went outside and saw the same lights approach from the same area that I saw them previously and moving in the exact same direction.  Same amber lights as last time. We went inside and tried to call our neighbor to come out and look b! ut couldn&#39;t get a hold of them. So we went outside again 5 mins later and saw the same lights for a third time approaching again from the southeast moving towards the northwest. An airplane was taking off from the airport at this time as well, but moving in a different direction. At this time I took out my phone and recorded video in which you can see the airplane exit the video to the left and you can hear its engines. On this pass one of the objects went from having an amber light to a white and red colour which was very visible. You can&#39;t make this out in the video though.<n>

4/6/13 21:58|Lebanon|PA|Circle|00:01:00|Witnessed an orange in color light shaped as a circle, moving across the sky, from the southern horizon to the north.|5/15/13|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/097/S97012.html|352|ndxe201304| Witnessed an orange in color light shaped as a circle, moving across the sky, from the southern horizon to the north.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I came outside to smoke a cigarette.  I know the exact time it was in the air as I had placed a call to the comm center for someone else to run out and witness this. At the time I placed the call the object was directly overhead (just east) of my position. When I came outside I noticed an object that looked similar to an orange in color streetlamp. Only the object seemed to be moving as would maybe a plane would.  So I just watched it but initially paid no attention for the first few seconds as I thought it was just a plane. As it came closer to my position I noticed it was &amp;quot;different&amp;quot;.  I started to pay more attention to it. I dont remember it getting brighter as it closer, I just thought why is that street light moving? I then began thinking &amp;quot;someone else has got to see this&amp;quot;.  But it was hard for me to get my phone out and make a call because i felt that i didnt want to miss any of this. I made a call then to a co-worker to come outside.  There was absolutely no sound.  It seemed to be orange in color, and maybe just a little bit oblong, as to a circle. I waited for some type of sound as it was closer to me now than before. Judging the distance from my viewpoint and that the sky was somewhat overcast, I was in shock that i did not hear anything. By the time my co-worker had made it outside it was indistinguishable. It seemed as though the tail end was somewhat not as bright as the front. I lost sight of it through a tree on the opposite horizon. The craft came from the south and headed north bound. Seeming to pass right over the city of Lebanon. I believe it came from a south easterly direction then seemed to maybe &amp;quot;curve&amp;quot; to take a direct north bound path. I knew the sky was overcast as I could only see a star or two in the sky. This object seemed to not be obstructed whatsoever from cloud cover. so im guessing it was somewhat &amp;quot;low&amp;quot; altitude. the sighting lasted about 1.10 minutes. Thats m! y best judgement. It never changed color or shape, only as it ! passed o ver the tail end seemed to be &amp;quot;dimmer&amp;quot; than the front. I dont believe it was a &amp;quot;perfect circle&amp;quot;, but It didnt seem to be cigar shaped or egg shaped. Thats the best description I can recall. It did somewhat shake me up, because I knew it didnt seem to be a plane or helicopter like ive witnessed numerous times. As I work in a 911 center in Lebanon County, I was excited to go back in hoping to get some calls on a strange light in the sky. We received no calls regarding any lights or aircraft.<n>

They looked like ultra-light planes, but it was completely dark.  We passed a church parking lot in Patten.  There were two pick-up trucks in the parking lot, the other occupants also watching the lights, and one vehicle half-out in the road (Route 11).  That vehicle moved out of our way after we came to a stop on Route 11.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We had eaten steak, potatoes, salad, and had drunk iced tea and coffee.  Two middle-aged women and one young woman in the car, one a church deacon.  We had been driving along and singing folk songs.<n>

They were in close proximity to each other in the N. Eastern sky and just a short distance over the tree line.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I saw the first group, I pointed them out to my friend and our initial thoughts were that they were planes, but concluded they were much too close to each other and the lights were not those of planes.  Then we thought they might be helicopters, but again, they did not resemble helicopters….the orbs were amber glows!<n> <n><n> <n><n> As my friend acknowledged the first group while she was driving, I maneuvered to get a better look out of the back window and noticed yet another grouping of the same orbs!  We both were a gasp as to what the heck those things were and we then quickly started looking for a safe place to pull over to get a better look.  We thought for sure other people must have seen it too! Could they be drones?!<n> <n><n> <n><n> Before getting to a stopping point, we noticed that the number of orbs in the two groups had diminished leaving only one &amp; two in the first group, and two and three in the second group.<n> <n><n> <n><n> While my friend fumbled in excitement to get pictures, the orbs continued to slowly fad away – one by one- and then they were gone.   There was no sound!  She did manage to get a few photos, but by that time, they were pretty much faded….we wished we would have recorded it, because now…who would believe us?!!<n>

They caught my attention as they were in an almost cross formation or a &amp;quot;T&amp;quot;.  We pulled over to get a better look, and to listen.  We assumed they were helicopters. No other air crafts could be in that formation and their proximity to one another were close.  Furthermore they seemed motionless.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Upon pulling over we noticed two had disappeared. We watched the last two start to separate and then just disappear.  There was virtually no cloud cover so they did not disappear into a cloud.  They just vanished.<n>

I took random photographs that day and one was a photograph of a street sign ?mole Street&#34; against the clear blue sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At that time i didn&#39;t notice anything in the sky and really wasn&#39;t focused on that.  Only later did i see a white streak and zoomed in to see what it was.  I was very surprised that it showed this round white object with a a smoke trail behind it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I computerized the image to see if it would resolve into an airplane and a contrail.  No matter what i did the round shape persisted.  i used some of the tools available to bring it in closer and in a sharper contrast. It is not an airplane,or birds, or a balloon, and is too round to be a meteor.  It is not flaw in the camera or lense.  I&#39;ve never seen a ufo but apparently i took a picture of one completely by accident.<n>

Very suddenly, and almost out of nowhere, a very large object with blue lights and one red light came silently across the sky from the south and seemingly in slow motion, (but it happened fast) descended down to the east approximately 30-50 feet ….this was happening roughly 100 - 125 feet in front of me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was huge and didn’t make noise …nor did it seem to make the trees that it was situated among move. It seemed to have a black v shaped body but the lights were so intense, big and bright that I can not be 100% clear on that.  It  came down, stopped for a few brief seconds, seemed to flash a red light and then left. (it was illuminated by blue lights the entire time ….a beautiful blue like I’ve never seen. Different somehow but I can not tell you how. Right before the red light became more apparent, the blue lights seemed to have deepened or become more intense and large.  The red light seemed to be in the center and  also seemed to “flash” one time as if it had some sort of purpose in doing so, right before it took off.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Everything seemed very sudden but yet happening in slow motion until the craft suddenly gained altitude and distance very quickly. Almost in the blink of an eye and heading east.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I do not know why, but at this moment I didn’t think to much of it. The impact of what I had just seen hadn’t quite “registered” yet.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I began to look up into the sky directly after this object left and noticed 2 very bright objects. Approximately 12-16,000 feet altitude.  One to the east and one to the south.  The white light of these 2 objects seemed to flicker very fast but both objects also had red light on them …every few seconds I could see a red light that, sometimes, seemed to turn more of an orange and then what appeared to be “beams” of white light coming down from them.  The one positioned in the east seemed to be much more active as it was bobbing up and down and sideways erratically, sometimes stopping for a small portion of time, and then would disappear,.  Maybe behind a cloud or just all on its own . I say “maybe” behind a cloud because it was lightly cloudy.  However, I could not tell if it was going behind the cloud or just disappearing all on its own only to reappear again.   The one positioned in the south seemed to have all of the same features and light properties of the one in the east but! wasn’t moving around as much.  Although, in order to keep my eyes on one, I had to then turn them away from the other.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I watched both objects very curiously for approximately 3-5 minutes, at which time I began to feel uneasy and came back inside.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I came inside, sat down and that’s when I  started to really question what I had just seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thinking about it now it is very surreal and hard to process yet very vivid.  As I sat and questioned what I had just seen I suddenly wanted to go back outside to see if they were still in the sky. I walked out on the porch again and immediately saw, approaching from the south, something flying much faster than an airplane, making no noise, (not that I could hear or recognize) and all lit up in red. I would approximate the altitude of this red flying object to be 8,000 feet.  It seemed to be shaped like a remote controlled helicopter but was hard to make out because it was all lit up red and parts of it were flashing VERY fast.  Like a strobe light.  I watched it fly to the east for roughly 40 seconds before feeling uneasy again and stepping back inside where I stayed until bed time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The sequence of these sightings and events took place in an approximate 20 minute time frame.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

4/5/13 20:30|Hilmar|CA|Triangle|2 minutes|Triangular shaped object, with serpent like moving tail, and blue, red, green, orange, and white lights.|5/15/13|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/097/S97057.html|375|ndxe201304| Triangular shaped object, with serpent like moving tail, and blue, red, green, orange, and white lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Hello, I am writing this letter because I believe that I have seen a real UFO. I am a college student studying to become a lawyer and I have a real case UFO. On Friday, April 5, 2013 in a small town called Hilmar California I saw what I believe was a UFO. I was going home from a buddy’s house, and I had my two friends with me but I needed to drop them off first. We were heading towards the McDonald’s in town in order to pass through Hilmar and take my friend home when I noticed something in the sky.  At first I thought it was a plane because I noticed some blue lights that were blinking, but as we got closer I noticed that it was coming to a stop seemingly.  We started to approach a stop light right next to the McDonald’s and I became somewhat terrified.  What at first I thought to be a plane turned to be a triangular shaped object in the sky, with blue, white, orange, green and red lights blinking underneath its base.  I saw no wings and the lights had a pattern to them, and there were 3 different light patterns.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first I couldn’t believe my eyes and I was thinking of what it could possibly be.  I noticed that it was basically above us, or somewhat above us, but only a couple hundred feet above the earth. The object seemed to be about as big as a car or a little bit bigger.  And I noticed a tail at the end.  The tail is what tripped me out the most, because of the unusual way that it was moving.  This was not a metallic tail or anything hard and solid.  I could tell because it was moving very rapidly from side to side, like how a snake would slither across the ground. The tail was very faint looking as well, not solid or really noticeable per say.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first me and my friends were discussing the possibilities as to what it could be. A friend of mine could only bring up a kite.  I was looking for a string but I could not make it out or see a string or anything else that could have been attached to the object.  Then I came to my senses, and told my friend that there was next to no wind outside.  If it was a kite, the person would have to run quite a bit of distance in order to create enough wind for the kite to take off.  I could not see a single person on the sidewalks and again, I could not see a string attached.  Then I also asked my friend about the tail.  As too why the tail was only moving from side to side, instead of up and down with the wind. And especially since the object was not moving one bit, it was completely stationary.  So I asked my friend why the tail was only moving and not the object?  And he could not respond to me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The really weird thing was, this was at 8:30 at night, and I can’t imagine anyone that would fly a kite at that time of night, because it was completely dark outside now.  And once more, this looked to be like directly above us, and a couple other cars that were at the stop light also noticed the object and were pointing at it.  I believe this was a real UFO because I just can’t think of anything else that it could have been.  I researched kites with lights, expensive kites, and design kites, and nothing seemed to be like what I saw.  This looked to be a lot heavier than a kite would have been, and it looked just as big as a car or a bit bigger. That was really weird and I will never forget what I saw that night.  I mean, at a distance, and I mean a couple 1000 yards or so I saw this thing moving, and as I got closer it stopped, and I didn’t see anyone holding a string or even a string attached to it at all, and the aerodynamics don’t make sense either.  Why was the tail only mov! ing and the whole object was completely stationary.  Around the object was a black glare kind of, like I couldn&#39;t really see the edges of object, so it was kind of blending in with the night sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides little contact information.

They seemed to be a hundred yards above the ocean and about the same distance from shore. Stopped at the beach to get a better look.  A few of them had disappeared, and the remaining we&#39;re almost too Hightower be seen.  Two new ones appeared low over the water to the north.  By this time, the remaining original lights had disappeared. The two new ones moved south toward me, gaining altitude until they were no longer visible. It took about two minutes or less for these last two objects to move south past me and rise out of sight. These objects were bright yellowish-orange lights. They did not appear to have any shape other than the light itself. However, the last object I saw the clearest, since I was able to see it at its low altitude. It seemed to have some red in the light. I did not have a camera or phone with me. I have never researched UFOs, seen one, or even believe! d in them (until now).<n>

My next-door neighbor was on Facebook on his phone when he saw a posting from another neighbor, XXXX, down the street about the unidentified lights in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So XXX, my next-door neighbor, went outside to look at what XXXX was writing about.  Dan got very excited and called me and my husband outside, to see the lights.  They appeared in the north sky in an equilateral triangle formation, with one light at the apex of the triangle and two at the bottom.  The lights were orange in color and looked rather like flames or that they were shimmering.  All three lights hovered in the triangular pattern for a few minutes, and then it appeared that the two lights at the bottom of the triangle were growing dimmer until they finally disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I ran into the house and got a pair of binoculars, through which I viewed the remaining light. It was still a bit blurry for me, so I! gave the binoculars to my husband. He said the remaining light appeared to be an array of parallel lights numbering 4 on each side, with a white light on the top and bottom of the array, in the middle of the parallel.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The remaining light began to move slowly west in the sky for several minutes until it too, disappeared. When the lights disappeared, it looked like they were turning sideways until they were no longer visible.  At no time did any of us hear any sound and the lights did not move quickly.  There were a few distant airplanes in the sky, whose blinking running lights appeared quite different from these orange lights.  Another of XXX’s friends, whom he called, also saw the lights from a different perspective about a quarter mile away from our house.<n>

We were on hwy 141 and just crossed over hwy 40 right by St Luke’s hospital and noticed 10 to 12 orange glowing globes not really high up and people were pulled over taking pictures or videos but I have not found any pic or video on you tube or such.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was to chicken to pull over …I saw that movie Fire In The Sky LOL<n>

It had rungs and was just like a ladder bent into the shape of a circle.  Also it had approximately four rectangular boxes equally spaced around the circle.  It was basically gray in color except at one end it progressed to black.  It was stationary. I could not see any attachment.  I was looking for a balloon or something. I was at the intersection of Route 165 &amp; East/West highway.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am not a trained observer but I would estimate it was about 3,000&#39; to 5,000&#39; feet high, about 100&#39; to 200&#39; in diameter.  The &#39;rungs&#39; had to be 10&#39; to 15&#39; in length and you could see thru it in the center and between the rungs.  The strangest thing to me was it didn&#39;t move and there wasn&#39;t any noise.<n>

4/4/13 21:55|Oceanside|CA|Light|20 minutes|Three orange to red undulating lights above cloud cover, in series, at somewhat regular intervals of five to eight minutes.|5/15/13|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/096/S96975.html|386|ndxe201304| Three orange to red undulating lights above cloud cover, in series, at somewhat regular intervals of five to eight minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At approximately 2150 I went out for a walk with the dogs. I’m a habitual star gazer, and was looking at the night sky. A low and light cloud cover with intermittent gaps provided a peaceful view as I walked. At 2155 I noticed, approaching from a northwesterly direction, a bright orange point of light with a slight reddish glare. It was just above the clouds. The intensity of the light undulated and the speed was variable. This was not due to the effect of uneven cloud cover, as it was too thin in the beginning to be the cause. Even in the gaps, where the sky was clear, the color and intensity of the light undulated and the speed varied. The object also moved almost imperceptibly from left to right at irregular intervals, but kept to its trajectory toward the southeast. From the horizon (zero degrees) to approximately 130 degrees (sorry, I can’t calculate angular velocity here), it traveled for about 20 seconds before speed slowed and the light began to fade! . It almost looked as though it was ascending or stopping at the end, but as it moved over thicker cloud cover, I could not discern which. There was no flicker or winking as it faded and disappeared from view, and no noise with the exception of a civilian helicopter in the distance.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I called the national UFO reporting center and was interrupted by a second light at approximately 2108.  A second call was interrupted by a third sighting, another five to eight minutes later.  In all three cases, the light appeared from over the northwest horizon and moved southeast, passing directly overhead. Again, there was no noise, slight wavering in direction, slight variation in speed, and dramatic slowing at the end as the light faded.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After the third siting, and upon the advice of the gentleman who answered my call to the NRC hotline, I called the FAA Flight Service Station in San Diego, which reported light cloud cover at 1300 feet and very light winds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I called the Camp Pendleton Command Duty Officer, who said there were no exercises on the range that he was aware of. He speculated that illumination from an artillery battery could be the cause, but as a Marine myself, I know of no reason why the 11th Marines would be firing arty illumination over the civilian population more than fifteen miles to the south. (The altitude of such illumination would be much higher than seen as well -- though not as high as illumination launched or dropped by aircraft – in either case, this is definitely not what I saw.) This was not something that looked like any conventional illumination the USMC might use in training.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I called the Oceanside Police Department desk sergeant, who said there were no other calls or operations in the area – and frankly I am not sure the Oceanside Police would have any reason to launch flares from a helicopter. The desk sergeant said she would have thought they were flares as well.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I want to say these were flares. They looked much larger and brighter than stars, undulating, and fading, but not winking out. The cloud cover prevented a clear, sustained view for the entire arc of movement. These objects seemed to be moving much faster than any flare I have seen, including military grade flares. They were directional and not drifting, and when they faded they didn’t appear to descend at all, but either remained at altitude (above 1500 feet at least) or ascended. If they were flares, they were pretty darn good ones -- just not for ground illumination! Very strange, indeed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Unfortunately, I was unable to capture any images on my iPhone.<n>

The lights were very bright and blinking in a fast motion.   The object was a lot larger than an airplane and the lights were a lot brighter.  I stared at it for a couple of seconds before yelling for my son to come out and see it.  As he ran out the object seemed to slow down for about 10 seconds and then proceeded to go continue in the northwest direction at a fast speed. It vanished and we couldn&#39;t see it anymore.  Afterwards I looked at 3 airplanes that was no where near as big or as bright as this object was in the sky.  Compared to an airplane it was about 30-50 airplanes put together in comparison. This happened around 9:12 pm Indianapolis, Indiana.<n>

It was moving slower than the 737&#39;s that come in over the bay to head south to SeaTac airport.  was clearly not an airliner.  It came in from the west then turned south along the waterfront then began oscillating along its path southward then turned west and accelerated heading west over West Seattle and then disappeared.<n>

It was moving fast, looked to have been relatively low due to lack of light distortion.   from the west to an almost south-east heading, where it seemed to fade, either as it got farther, or dimmed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is the other daughter&#39;s report:  I was outside with name removed when she told me that she saw something at around 9:35 tonight.  We had just gotten home from seeing name removed, and were about ready to walk in the doorway.  After she hollered for my attention, I noticed that there was an orange orb above our neighbors&#39; house.  I ran in for my camera, got you, and began taking pictures.  And as we observed, it moved west with us and name removed following both name removed and I and we observed it until it was no longer in our sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Here is what I saw:  An amber orange object hovering in the northeast sky.  The object was a solid orange seemed to have two points of light one above and below the object.  I think this could have been caused due to the brightness of the light as once the object started moving the point of light faded away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I observed object for about 1 minute before it started moving slowly in a northeast direction before fading from sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> NOTE:  I could not see individual lights on the object, but I could see them in the enclosed photo.

Object appeared the same from when it was heading towards me as when it was heading away from me. It did not seem to move at consistent pass.  It wandered across the sky. It was a perfectly clear night. I first mistook the object for a star until I referenced it with near tree to indicate it was in fact moving. I watched it pass by over by until it fainted it the horizon which would have been in Canada at that time. From first site until its disapearance was about 7 minutes.

They moved very fast and completetly silent from west to north- east.  Although the lights were large, they appeared to be far away, and quickly dimminished as they went across the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The lights appeared on the sky for no more than eight or nine seconds, and in that time, they had traveled from straight above me to gone in north-eastern direction.<n>

Green Crafts/Dark Shadow Crafts<n> <n><n> <n><n> I must stress the amount of activity over Vancouver&#39;s lower mainland and I am baffled no one appears to have made any reports supporting mine.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Please allow me to elaborate; I noticed pin-points of light traveling quickly in the night sky before last Christmas. They would stop then change direction so I knew they were not satellites. Soon after I noticed, and the only way to describe them is, triangle shaped craft&#39;s outlined by translucent, deep green lights. And not one or two but many. They are hard to see due to the colour temperature and easier to notice when it&#39;s overcast because the translucent deep green colour seems enhanced by the clouds.As well I&#39;ve noticed what appear to be dark square shadows in both the day and night sky. Both of these crafts appear to do the same thing; line up, fly a circular pattern then repeat it over and over almost as if they were repairing something (?) At 11pm PST and 1am PST I notice, again this the only way I can describe it, all of the translucent deep green outlined crafts standing still and omitting what appears to be a wide spread green &#39;laser&#39; similar to a rock concert laser light show. Synchronized, each craft&#39;s fan of beams pans left to right for approx. 2 minutes projecting a &#39;mesh&#39; over the night sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I spotted a dark shadow that hovered over a neighbors house for a number of night last January and shawn a green laser pointer at it. It slowly moved towards me and for 15 seconds hovered in front of me no more than 60 feet away. It resembled a pulsating eye, like a rain drop hitting a puddle, then moved off. It wasn&#39;t frightening and seemed as curious of me as I of it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Like I said, I noticed this before last November. I see these every night and think it would be more worrisome if they disappeared. I have video to show you and after reporting to local groups still absolutely no one ever gets back to me.<n>

We were in shock we seen this bright colorful object, we knew it was not an air plane or anything close to normal.  We knew it was something that was not from earth.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;m still in shock I will never forget what I&#39;ve seen.  I wish I could have took a picture but it happened so fast and we were in shock that we didn&#39;t have time to even turn to look at each other until the object disappeared.

As we were walking near my uncles house I notice a dark pink (red) glo coming from the sky.  It looked like a falling star, at first I thought it was a star, meter, then a plan, chooper?  Then it started to move back in forth - in a zig zag motion...It seemed like it was trying to hide behind a telephone pole then a tree but we seen it go back in forth in the sky then move out into the dark sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;m 45 years old Native American Navajo and this is my first incounter with anything like this and my friend. It moved like a red lazor light - and I&#39;m pretty sure it seen us - just the feeling we felt… I felt pressure behind my head and he felt pressure in his back.  It was pretty amazing - Very happy I seen something like this in my life...<n>

The sky was pretty clear, and while paying attention to one particular plane to the east, I noticed a relatively large transparent spherical object moving slowly through the sky to the north west of the plane.  Thinking it was just something in my eye, I began to look away, and noticed it hadn&#39;t moved with my line of vision.  I proceeded to rub my eyes, look back, look away, and am thoroughly convinced it was not anything in my eye.  The stars behind the object appeared blurry, almost as if I was looking through a lens of some sort.  As the object proceeded, the stars that were behind it were perfectly clear.  This procession across the sky continued for about 30 seconds, before it disappeared from sight.  Turning my attention back to the planes in the area, I noticed that all three planes (while maintaining different headings) were all relatively equidista! nt from where the object had disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am a software architect by profession, with a background in physics and mathematics.

Coast Line.<n> <n><n> <n><n> An hour or two after dark, I was at the main local beach on the coast line of the Southern end of Monterey Bay.  I was out for a typical night time sea shore trail walk which I do off and on.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was up on a 35 to 40 foot bluff that overlooks this rocky shoreline beach.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was a fairly clear evening but quite cold, so no one else was down in this area at this time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> While looking out over the Bay I noticed a bright orange object in the sky to the North.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was moving slowly South and towards me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am 61 years old and have lived here for 60 of those years.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I spend much time taking almost daily and many evenings walks down by the our rocky coast line.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have seen thousands of airplanes and even helicopters come in at night from the North (San Francisco Bay Area ) and South (from the Los Angeles area ). which land at our Monterey Peninsula airport.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I know exactly what these look like (and sound like) at night from far away distances all the way, until they pass over my head and land at our local airport.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This object looked nothing like regular air traffic.  It made no noise.  It moved very  slowly. It went perpendicular to the regular airport landing strip flight paths.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It came right over me. It was quiet while doing so.  No engine or other motor noise at all.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It had no small lights or bright landing ones.  It was just all bright orange.  Its shape was not exact because its bright light distorted this, but I kept thinking I was looking at a Chinese lantern.  It was a ball but with what seemed to be a somewhat beveled top and bottom.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have never seen a UFO and I must say I was a bit uneasy feeling when this passed over me at low altitude (guessing 1,000 feet?) and with no noise.  Its bright orange light was the same approaching as it was when it distanced itself after passing over me.  Approaching plane lights change once they pass over you.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I figured this glowing orange object had to be the size of a large truck or small bus judging from its size at the altitude I assume it was at.  From my ground level vantage point, it was the size of small orange held at arm&#39;s length.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date is approximate.  PD))<n>

The aircraft was less than 1000 feet off the ground also.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The aircraft was very dark with minimal lighting.  It had three very dimly lit red lights on each corner, in what most would consider a triangle.  The aircraft&#39;s lights never blinked, just remained dimly lit.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As the aircraft passed in front of me, it made zero sound.  I figured it was a stealth fighter or bomber.  I briefly spoke to a few people from work.  One stated it could have been a drone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I did call the sighting in by phone and it&#39;s recorded at our 911 center.

It was so weird.  Definitely wasnt a helicopter.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So I called my husband to come quick because I wanted him to explain what I was seeing.  At this point the object had moved west but my husband was able to observe it before our view would be obstructed by distant homes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After a few seconds of silence, my husband said, &#34;I think that was a UFO.&#34;  My thought exact! ly but I didnt say it because I didnt want to sound dumb and/or influence his thoughts.  My husband is in the military and assured himself as well as me, that it wasnt flares.  He seemed confused.  He also noticed that I was feeling nervous and that I kept going back to look out the window so he then said, &#34;Maybe it was a UAV.&#34;<n> <n><n> <n><n> So I started to second guess myself.  I got on the internet researched UAVs and let me tell you, I am more convinced now that we saw a UFO.  UAVs are a significantly smaller, do not have all the lights I saw, and not circular (disc) shaped.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After reading into UAVs, I googled UFO sightings in Copperas Cove, TX and one other person commented about it, but just said it was scary, and didnt give much information.  I would like to know that we arent the only ones that saw this.  Hoping other people come forward.  Should have recorded it.<n>

I looked up in the sky and was amazed by how clear it was and how bright the stars were.  I watched a jet flying east to west in the distance and heard its low engines.  Just then flying north to south, or maybe northeast to southwest, I saw what I thought was another jet.  It had two white lights, one brighter and one smaller very close together right behind, just like a jet.  But these lights moved incredibly fast.  And they left no trail like a meteor would, just two lights moving way faster than a jet would and then they disappeared in the middle of the sky.  A jet couldn&#39;t move that fast that high up and I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve ever seen a meteor leave no streak or just be two lights that close together.<n>

It was a very clear night and cold.  I was waiting on them to do their business and looking at the many stars and constellations.  I suddenly saw something to the west and at about a  60-70  degree angle up from the horizon.  It was a triangular shaped object moving in a straight line from slightly southwest to slightly northeast, but mostly south to north.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was difficult to see due to the dark coloring – slightly lighter than the night sky and dark brown/gray coloring.  There were extremely dim “lights” on the bottom – three at each corner – each grouping in a triangle shape – all a rusty red-orange color –very dim.  No blinking lights at all.  No sound before, during, or after.  It moved at a constant speed and fairly quickly.  I saw it for probably 10 seconds as I could only visualize it between two groupings of trees; it was not bright enough to see when it moved farther northeast behind the second group of trees.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I don’t know how big it was or how far away it was – I am not  good at judging this.  It appeared to me to be the size of 3-4 full moons (when it is directly overhead, not the huge moon size when it’s near the horizon).  I have seen a stealth plane fly directly overhead once before and this was nothing similar to it at all.  I have never seen anything like this before, but I hope to see this again someday.  Truly awesome!<n>

The objects kept formation, quickly flew towards the east and then disappeared.  This happened between 9pm and 10pm, EST, in Clermont, FL.

By the time I went outside, there were six flashing lights that seemed to both rise further off the horizon and closer to us.  When they started he only saw 3, but that was because they were coming up over the horizon.  They were blinking lights in a perfect order and distance apart.  They came up and hovered and slowly went back down below the horizon. While they were up, I did call a local news station to see if there had been any sightings and some other family members.  It was a cloudly night and they didnot see them.  My compass said it was 63 degrees N.E.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They were much bigger then stars.

They were 2 to 3 times the size of the reference stars visible that evening, and about twice as bright, coloring in, like stars, white/blue.  The 3 lights were moving independent of each other, though retaining a general left-to-right margin distance of approximately 3 1/2 to 4 inches thumb-to-finger distance at arms length (I’m 5’10 1/2”).  Each light &amp;quot;moved quickly”, which is to say that within this margin, these lights traveled the full distance in slightly-curved lines with tight, elevated/declined curves at the margins in about 1/2 second.  They did this sporadically about 5 times within the 30 seconds.  When not “moving quickly”, they seemed to stay still, though there was some “drifting away” in what appeared to be the same south by southeast direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After witnessing this event, I rushed into the house to get the kids and the camera; by the time I returned (1 to 1-1/2 minutes later), the thick-blanket cloud cover moving in from the southwest had obscured the lights<n>
