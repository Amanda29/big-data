And I mean into... The object was perfectly round and shiny like the radiance of a brand new penny only gold...it was about the size of my little finger fingernail. The object seemed to glide effortlessly through this place into the sky. I know that isn&#39;t getting the understanding accross but let me try this... in the olden days you use to see these drawing where the earth was drawn in a bubble representing atmosphere... and these aerial items like stars and things were depicted halfway out of the bubble and halfway in...well this craft came out of a place and went just a tiny way and went back in. I was not the only one on the highway but I was the only one on the up-ramp which has a bit of an incline so that my car was pointing into the sky as I approached the highway proper. It happened so quickly that I did not bother to stop... but proceeded awestruck! No sounds were heard... Two jets... almost perpendicular to the location of the craft were visible... they were itty-bitty and heading in a different direction than the craft.(Erie (PA) International Airport is nearby)<n>

I was perhaps 10-15 miles away from Cairo when the night sky lit up like daytime. It was very strange as it stayed lit for approximately 8-10 seconds.  This was reported on a local radio station as having lit up the entire area of Southern Missouri and Illinois. They claimed it was a meteor.  If so it was a very very bright one.  It seemd to be very strange at the time but I had forgotten it until I recently heard about the instance in New Mexico and it sounded just like the same type of event. At 44 years of age, I have never experienced anything like this before.<n>

We have been sitting @huck(a local restraunt) and chatting about shtuff.  We left.  As we were finishing up the conversation in front of my building, we both witnessed a single very bright white light(this was definately not an airplane... to bright to be one.  I live around Midway-O&#39;hare airport and I see planes all the time@night.  this assure you this was no plane.)  sorta fly  in a straight line from the NEE sky out to the NNW sky.  It caught our attention, but we didn&#39;t mention it to eachother until it sat there for a second and suddenly did a loopdee loop in the sky. It looked like a plane that went bunk-whack.  It was the wierdest thing that i have ever seen.  ANyway, after it did the loop it shot off into the NE sky out of sight.  It flew... very very very very very very very fast.  I have honestly never seen anything like it. We thought that it might be a plane, i tried to convince my friend of it being some gov&#39;t thing... but then a normal plane crossed the air and it was definately not that.  If you take the brightest light that plane has and triple that light... Anyway that&#39;s my story. I shall give you more info below...<n>

Disappeared suddenly.  5 separate red balls of light aligned next to each other, one at a time, bright flash as each appeared. Moved around, side to side, up and down, for a few minutes. All disappeared suddenly.  Many witnesses watched over Pleasure Point, others driving by pulled over to ask if we &#34;had also seen the strange lights?&#34;.<n>

Stoped and waffled alittle and was joined by 6 or so smaller orbs of light..on every 1/2 sec or so just above each other in a sequence..blinked slowly on and off then moved slow in formation one after another to tthe right and changed shape and then faded slowly .<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was walking my daughter home in the early evening....as we approched the long drive in to her mothers apartment complex we saw what looked like a meteor..very large and beautiful if a bit slow. I thought .. a comet?? But it was goldish and throwing a long orangish trail of sparks...then it did a slow upward swirl and I just about lost it...We had to move 30 ft or so with our view blocked by trees untill we reached the driveway where we saw it again and this confimed that it was quite distant and not a kite or somethig close by. Two other people shouted...Can you see it?? What the heck is it??? We hurred up to join them looking about 15 degrees about the SE horizon into 98% darkend sky. The object was waffleing to and fro fading in and out geting larger and then smaller. It is hard to say how large but I would estimate at least fifty feet or so in diameter.. maybe much larger. It was whitish to gold..mostly gold or amber. after about 30 sec or so just above the first object a smaller by 1/5 or so light appeared just for a sec followed by another just above it and then another and another...about 6 in all additional smaller lights. It was compleatly in sinc one after another in a stack above the large object. They then twinkled a little and moved one at a time of to the right each one further than the previous changing shape near the end of travel into a kind of oblong fluidlike blob and slowly fading out. This was I guess 2min or so and they twinkeled and swirlled around and took off...fading as they went. We saw the strobes of approaching aircraft(conventional) moving in from the west...and that was it.<n>

It remained stationary then suddenly seemed to fade from the outside in and disappeared. I didn&#39;t hear a sound from it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was walking down the paddocks in the Rosanna area. I was about 10m from a gate when I looked up at the sky. It was dark, the only light being from the moon which was almost entirely hidden by thick clouds. The clouds were reasonably stationary. I started to look down from the sky when a very bright circle of light caught my eye. It was a steady white colour. The light was completely stationary. It was a little below the cloud line in about a North Easterly direction a fair distance above the mountain range. I stopped and looked again. It was above the mountains so not originating from there. It wasn&#39;t a radio tower. It was far too large, bright and stationary to be a plane (There is a flight path running through the area.) My first thought was that it was a search helicopter (with a search light). (They are not unusual in the area) But the light seemed far too big and bright, especially since the light was quite a distance away. The light was also vey steady. Helicopters are also noisy. I didn&#39;t hear anything that sounded like a helicopter. It was just a quiet night. It stayed stationary for about a min. then suddenly the light appeared to diminish in size, as if fading from the outside in. This only took about 2 seconds. I watched to see if it would reappear for a little while. It did not, so I left. (I know what planets and stars look like and it was not those)<n>

I asked my husband what it was (we drive home this way every day/night).  I asked him if it was a pole?  A tower?  The closer we got the slower it appeared to be moving.  I whipped a U turn to follow it.  I caught up with it 40-50mph with the traffic.  Red, blue, green, yellow, white lights blipped like a pinwheel in the wind.  I kept asking well if it&#39;s a plane where are the &#34;beginning and end lights&#34; of the craft.  Then I asked why does it seem to be trapeziod and why do the lights change so much and twirl around like that!<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;ll explain when ya call, if ya call.  Or I will go into detail tommorow.  I&#39;d just like to found out if there was any military craft in the area.  I&#39;m safe to bet it was a couple of Apache&#39;s.  If so, what an awesome piece of equipment!<n>

At first I thought it was commercial aircraft, but I soon realized that it was not because it was a single orb of orange/yellow light that pulsated and remained stationary.  I knew it wasn&#39;t a copter because copters have more than one light and they don&#39;t pulsate. I continued looking at this thing and soon approached it, but it still did not move and continued to pulsate.  This event probably occurred in about 5 minutes time since I was traveling at about 40 mph. I continued to look back after I passed it, and it continued its strange behavior.<n>

I was watching our dog when suddenly my wife called to me to look up at the sky, to the south but nearly over head. Finally I saw what she was seeing.  It had about the dim visibility of a high flying plane.  But it made odd curved motions at what must have been fantastic speeds and changes of path that shouldn&#39;t have been possible.  Because we are near a major airport, there was air traffic visible with which to compare this object. It did not seem to be an airplane.  It was a light in the sky. But was it just reflecting moonlight or was it lit? I wonder if any of the flight crews saw what we did?<n>

I was heading home about 10:15 after picking up my daughter. We were traveling NE on Hwy 350 about a mile from the Pinyon Canyon Military Reserve (where there&#39;s been a lot of military activity since the Kosovo crisis). This is an extremely rural area and it was a clear night with 50 mile visibility. Suddenly I noticed a bright star-like object dead ahead about 30 degrees above the horizon. It was perfectly motionless and because of its color--bright yellow-orange--and size, I assumed it to be Mars even though it was brighter than Mars normally appears (more like the intensity of Venus). After a minute or two, it started moving to the right. I could gauge its movement relative to the other stars which were quite visible and NOT moving. After about two more seconds it accelerated quickly while fading out until it had completely disappeared. I woke my daughter, thinking perhaps that it WAS Mars, that its movement was an illusion due to our traveling, and that it had simply become obscured by clouds. However, there were no clouds in the sky anywhere. Then my daughter said, &#34;Dad, Mars is over there (pointing SE out her window).&#34; Sure enough, Mars was to our right. Suddenly we noticed two black military helicopter flying off in close formation in the direction where the object disappeared.<n>

The lights appeared to be at a high altitude.  They were moving at the same rate of speed, but one light was slightly ahead of the other.  Initially, it appeared as if there were two shooting stars moving beside each other, but whatever it or they were was moving slower than any shooting star I have observed yet much too fast to be an aircraft.  As I watched, both lights disappeared simultaneously, yet the travel path was still clear - in other words, if it were an airplane, it would have continued to have been observable.  It all occurred within about 10 seconds.  I can say that I have never seen anything like it before.<n>

There were no clouds. I was outside on the deck on the east side of the house looking in the southeast sky trying to find Mars so I could look at it through my telescope.  Looking in the ESE sky at about 30-40 degrees I noticed what appeared to be a stationary group of 3 stars or planets, arranged in a triangular formation. They were white to yellowish in color and about the same size as Saturn or Jupiter, and spaced about 2 finger-widths apart (if held at arm&#39;s length). I didn&#39;t see any other structure around them.  The sky still was light (pale blue). I looked at them for approx. 5 seconds, and then saw that they began to move as a group to the north.  The kept the same distance from each other and maintained the same formation. Their speed was not incredibly fast, probably similar to an airplane.  They did not blink or change color or size.  They continued to move along the horizon to the north and then they gradually faded. What puzzled me was that these lights were standing still and looked like stars when I first saw them and then they began to move.  I don&#39;t think they were planes. I told my husband about them and he said they were probably satellites.  I&#39;ve seen satellites fly over, usually at night and directly overhead.  These were different.<n>

It had a marker light on each side and after it came back at us you could see two dimmer lights in the front. We just stood there watching it knowing it was not from here. It came back south and then turned west and went over town untill it dissapeared. We both just stood there like it froze us. Hope this is helpful .<n>

Early this morning while doing my rounds I noticed a bright light in the eastern sky about twenty degrees above the horizen.  It caught my eye because in was moving too quickly to be an airplane.  It increased in intensity untill it was brighter than a planet looks.  It then turned red and shot north untill I could not see it any more.  This all happened over a period of only ten seconds.  I stood there for a few minutes And it came back in just about the same spot I had seen it before this time moving around for about a minute.  I could not watch for it any longer because I had to finish my rounds.  The second time I saw it went from a small dot of light into one as bright as a planet and about equall in size. The movement of the light was random, it would move in one direction and then go off at a 90deg angle.  It dissapeared the same way both times losing intensity as it changed to red in color and shooting off to where I could no longer see it.  The first light was at 0405 and the seconed at 0411.<n>

To the South lay a cloud bank that I believe to have hung over Centralia. This object passed between our position and the southern bank of clouds that hung in the twilight. The entire event lasted no more than 2-4 seconds in duration. I have no doubt that the impact was somewhere SE of the I-5 corridor in Olympia. I work as a underground utility location dispatcher in Bellevue, Washington. My trip to Olympia Saturday was to attend a house warming of a old friend. As a sometimes avid skywatcher I have in my life seen many meteor showers.This was not the most spectacular event I have witnessed, but this one definitely hit deck so to speak. I am aware of the Montana event and have spoke to an aquantence who believes he saw that same object Friday somewhere on the 405 North corridor in Bellevue. The object I saw however was definitely an independant event occuring Saturday.<n>

These lights appeared to be interacting with each other, moving at high speeds, occasionally stopping and moving at extreme angles. The sky was fairly clear with some high clouds. These lights appeared to move behind and through the clouds on occasion. Within a few minutes, there were approx. 50 to 75 people witnessing the event. I could overhear several comments from the other people, and some were suggesting that perhaps they were high flying birds reflecting the lights from the strip. However, I thought that it was highly unlikely since the lights seemed to be very high and moving at extreme speeds. Approx. 5 minutes later, I began to see this long, thin vaporous line move across the sky in front of these 4 lights. It captured my interest because it appeared to move in a deliberate fashion. After observing this for several seconds, the gaseous line instantly materialized into 10 to 15 round, luminous objects that appeared to have all colors of the spectrum, and quite larger than the original 4 lights. They moved slowly high overhead in a chevron formation making no sound. One of the original 4 lights then joined with the objects as they continued high above. I had to bend my neck completely back; almost losing my balance to continue observing the phenomenon until it went over the Monte Carlo Casino and was obscured from my sight. Immediately, people began to shout with excitement. Some women were crying with fear, and some of the &#34;skeptics&#34; were stunned and annoyed that they could not explain it. I was absolutely blown away by what I saw. Perhaps, I could be persuaded to believe in some plausible explanation for the original 4 lights, but this phenomenon could not be explained away as birds, lasers, aircraft, satellites, or natural occurences, i.e., asteroids, meteorites, ball lightening or swamp gas. As we stood around in amazement, we continued to watch the remaining 3 lights in the sky. A minute or so later, I began to observe another vaporous line coming now from a point further south than the first, moving slowly, and instantly materializing again into 10 to 15 round, luminous objects moving in a chevron formation. Each time, it appeared that the objects were moving independently from each other but in formation. It did not appear to be one solid object. Unfortunately, approx. 15 minutes had gone by and the 4 of us had to get to the airport to make our flight back home to Seattle. The lights were still being observed as we walked away. The next day, I called the Las Vegas Journal to see if anything was reported. The Editor laughed and said there always was strange stuff going on in the sky and was not interested in getting my story. Background of Observers: 1.

Apr 24 around 8:45 to 9:00 p.m., my wife and her brother called my attention to &#34;UFO&#39;s&#34; over the MGM (S.E.ly maybe 20 to 30 degrees from overhead). At first, I didn&#39;t see them and thought they were joking, but I then observed 20 or so people in front of me looking in the same direction and pointing. With the help of my brother-in-law, I was able to locate 4 round lights. (The size of each in relation to my hand at arm&#39;s length was roughly like looking at an eraser on the end of a pencil.) The sky was generally clear, but the four lights were in the area of one of the few clouds in the sky. The lights were all staying in the general area of the cloud, but would move into a gap in the cloud and sometimes out from behind the cloud completely. Even when behind the cloud, the lights were visible. The movement of the lights was very intriguing. Each would hover for a bit, then it might move in a sweeping manner upward. Sometimes one would streak horizontally and then would instantaneously reverse course or move at a radical angle. Each of the lights was moving independently of the others. This continued for several minutes. My wife then exclaimed, &#34;Look at that!&#34; and pointed just a little south of the cloud. I looked in time to see what I would call a gaseous light, greenish in hue, significantly larger than the round lights. It was like looking at an image through heat waves in the desert. I estimate it was three to four inches relative to my hand at arm&#39;s length. Within ten seconds or so the gaseous area resolved into more precise lights, jewel-like and muti-colored and the lights were in a formation that changed and within a few more seconds, appeared as a chevron shape, keeping the same overall size as the initial gaseous image. It then moved towards us, keeping a constant height and a smooth and steady course. I notice a round light, that looked like one of the first lights that we had observed, was flying just to my left of the chevron formation. Looking back into the cloud area at the first lights, I could now only find three of the round lights. They were still hovering and/or moving as before. The chevron/round light formation was continuing on its course and speed and slowly moved directly overhead and beyond until it was eventually obscurred by the Monte Carlo building. I strained to see if I could make out an object in the lights or hear any sound coming from the formation, but could not. Looking back to the area where the chevron first appeared, the &#34;gaseous image resolving to chevron&#34; event repeated. Again, the chevron was joined by a round light. I now could only see two round lights in the cloud area. The combo formation was, like the first, moving towards us. I looked from the sky to the area in which we were standing and noticed that there were now many more people watching the event. Most were exclaiming in amazement, myself included. When the first chevron appeared, I had heard many people shout as had my wife. There were a few cries of fear. It also looked like people on the other side of Las Vegas Boulevard in front of the MGM were also looking skyward and pointing. We crossed the street to the area in front of the New York, New York Casino. The second chevron had now disappeared from view over the Monte Carlo. I could now only see one of the original round lights. I pointed it out to a person coming out of the casino who said that he had seen this event before and that it was a bird, like a hawk, with ground lights reflecting off of it. He did not observe the chevron lights. A few other random observations: We observed the event for about fifteen minutes. I wanted to stay longer, but we had to leave to catch a flight at the airport. Early in the event, I noticed a small civilian aircraft in the general area, but it was lower and farther to the east. The event took place relatively close to the Las Vegas airport. Another friend that accompanied us never saw the round lights, but witnessed the chevrons. Although he is highly skeptical by nature, he had no explanation for what he saw. The MGM has large green lights that illuminate the building. The Luxor, farther south on the Strip, has a laser on top. I am not sure how high the clouds were and consequently have difficulty estimating the actual size or altitude of the formation. I have racked my brain trying to come up with an explanation for what we observed. I do not buy into the bird theory because of the relative speed in relation to the clouds, the radical flight patterns of the round lights, the visibility behind the clouds. Holographic images don&#39;t seen to fit either because of the great distance traveled by the chevrons. Also, at no time were the clouds themselves ever illuminated. We watched the paper for reports of the observation by others. My wife called the newspaper in Las Vegas. They said that they had not received any reports. They did not seem interested in her report. We recently learned of this site and decided to report our experience.<n>
4/24/99 14:04|Indianola|WA|Unknown|04/19/99|Three bright white lights evenly spaced with a additional flashing red light to the immediate left of the center bright white light.  I|4/26/99|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/006/S06366.html|25|ndxe199904| Three bright white lights evenly spaced with a additional flashing red light to the immediate left of the center bright white light.  It was traveling over the Indianola area (Miller Bay), toward Saquamish and Bainbridge Island, south-west at 21:19-21:28.  There was also a bright white/green white strobe with every third blink of the red light.  Quiet and huge in width, height unknown, speed hard to estimate not knowing the height or actual size.  It did travel at a constant speed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Looking out my window in a south-west direction a very large object with lights caught my attention passing over our budding alder tree.  I jumped up looked out my window and spotted 3 steady bright white lights lined up in a straight line and evenly spaced to my upper left still moving in a south-west direction overhead. I looked at my watch and it read 9:19pm.  The center steady white light had a blinking red light near it and an additional whitish or slightly greenish strobe.  The whitish light flashed with every third or so red flash.  The red light flashed once every other second or so.  I grabbed our W.W.II tank binoculars mounted on a tripod and checked it out.  It was really wide, a lot wider and larger than any plane I have ever seen here, I could not establish what the objects shape was, I could only see the line of lights.  I ran out onto the balcony and did not hear engines, then I ran back into living room and watching with the binoculars as it disappeared into a long white wispy cloud. There were very few clouds in the south-west sky. I looked at my watch and now it read 9:23pm. I called my wife in San Diego and told her what I saw, while keeping my eyes on the cloud.  I thought it had gone, when all of a sudden it reemerged on the far side of the cloud (the south-west side) and made a left turn.  I again looked at my watch and now it read 09:28.  I followed it with the binoculars until it faded after what seemed to be 3-4 minutes.  I forgot to look at my watch this time because I ran into the den, grabbed a compass and ran back into the living room.  I established the course heading at approximately 200-210 degrees on the south-west leg from 9:19-9:23pm.  When it came out of the cloud at 09:28pm and changed its course to the left, I approximated the left turn to be about 60 degrees. That is a really rough guess.  I approximated using existing land marks, my compass, estimated time and the objects diminishing relative size.  I am still not sure just how high it was but it was big. There were small plane passing between me and the cloud the object disappeared into and they were really dwarfed in comparison to the width of the line of lights, probably about a 15:1 ratio.<n>

The anomoly description: Tear dropped shaped with the wide part at the bottom. The anomoly was tilted slightly to the left and the tail at the top, tapering to a point at the bottom. The anomoly was titled slightly to the left and the tail at the bottom was also tilted to the left at about a 45 degree angle. At the lower right side of the anomoly there was an area on the edge of the anomoly of light orange in color. The orientation of this anomoly was vertical. The anomoly was solid black, and appeared to be rounded towards me. There is no way to tell how far away this anomoly was from me at the time of the sighting, but if it were to be at the same distance as my model aircraft I would estimate its vehicular size to be from 500 to 800 feet in height. Note that the sky was a cloudless field of blue at the time of this sighting. The anomoly stayed fixed in one position with no movement during the sighting. It was there one moment and gone the next.

I live on the 4th floor in an apartment bldg. The window faces west. I saw a green ball of light traveling in a northwest direction. It was not falling from the sky, but treversing very fast accross the sky. The object was unviewable after about 15 seconds. The object never chaned direction, and had a very destinct tail light of an bright orange color.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The size of the object was about 4 to 5 times the size of a star. I have lived in seattle for over 9 years. I personally have not seen any green objects such as this until this past year. This is the third time I have seen the green light. I might also say that I was working graveyard shifts the past two times, and was traveling on I-5 heading south. The object had a trail, it did not leave a trail.<n>

My body was lying feet to the west, head to the east. The cloud cover for the sky was patchy but at about 40-50%. That night there must have also been a bright moon because I clearly remember a particularly intense luster to the clouds. I was talking with a friend when I noticed out of the corner of my right eye (to the north) movement that really only registered consciously but not so that it drew my attention. I did realize that the motion was extremely fast and for some very puzzling reason, I felt compelled to look to the south in the night sky as if I knew that it was moving so fast that to attempt to turn my head and look at it would mean missing it and instead I looked south to allow it to travel through my field of vision where I could track it with my eyes as it entered. What I saw, albeit brief, to this day is the most profound event I have ever witnessed. I was able to see the objects for no more than three seconds in the sky. They entered my vision heading south at what I would estimate at between 800-1000 mph based on the change in degree of my field of view and the time in which the change occurred. The objects were as follows: there were three light blue or grey light triangles with only the borders illuminated. That is to say that the objects looked like isoscelene triangles made of flourescent light bulbs. The objects appeared to be dodging in and out of the clouds from my vantage point. I can not, however, state with any certainty how far away they may have been or if they were above or below the clouds. It was especially difficult to tell because the illumination of the objects was not unlike that of the clouds in intensity. But, not only did the objects appear to be moving in and out of the clouds but they moved as though they were completing repeated figure-eights with each other at a very constant rate. I remember being scared deeply by the exact nature in which the objects moved with each other. I guess it scared me because I had never seen anything as geometric, fast, or precise in motion any where in the natural world around me. These certainly were not birds or aircraft. Any aircraft moving this fast would have created at least a sonic boom not to mention either a contrail or engine noise. Almost as soon as the event was recorded in my sight, it was over. I jumped to my feet and started swearing quite loudly and asking anyone of about six people within about two feet of me if &#34;they saw that&#34;. I was struck dumb with disbelief having seen something that to this day has left me with no logical answers. Here is some important info about the area. Fargo is, apparently, no stranger to the sighting of aerial phenomena as I had found out after checking out some other reportings and found that North Dakota itself is a hotbed. The area of Fargo itself where I was when I saw this event occur is not more than one mile south of the 119th Strategic Bombing Wing and an Air National Guard base. Grand Forks, ND is just 80 miles north and is home to one of the largest air bases in the United States. Often in the area, one can see large aircraft landing, committing touch-and-go&#39;s, taking off and rolling flight patterns over the area. I am not, however, even going to begin to kid myself into believing that what I saw was military aircraft or any kind of commercial aircraft. The speed was simply astounding not to mention the risk of flying three aircraft in a weave-pattern in and out of each other at ANY speed. And finally, background on me. I graduated from that college (NDSU) in 1999 with a Bachelor of Science degree in Archaeology with a specialization in cartography and linguistics. My minor degree was Psychology. I am an accomplished Martial artist and guitar instructor and I have a very well paying job working as a systems analyst in Minneapolis. I am not any sort of cuckoo or permanent day-dreamer. I have nothing to gain by reporting this event. I apologize for waiting over a year and a half to report this event but the very mention of the phrase &#34;I saw something last night I can&#39;t explain...&#34; got me glances from the wierdest of my colleagues. I hope that this report helps your efforts. God Bless and take care... A Believer. PS Due to the nature of my report, I hope that you understand my reluctance to transmit my address and name. You can, however, contact me via the email address below and I will respond as I am possible. Thank you...<n>

The lights on the objectdid not blink and were very dim, not as bright as a star, but none the less quite visible.The triangular object hovered for an instant and then took off in a northerly direction at in my opinion 4 to 5 times faster than a commercial airliner and then disappeared.The craft was absolutley silent.<n>

I first noticed it when it was &#34;above&#34; the building, it streaked out into the open &#34;to the west of the building&#34; and dissappeared.  It moved and dissappeared like a meteor but it was red in front and green in back.  It was totally silent.  I don&#39;t know how far away it really was but our building is two stories high and the patio is aproximately 75feet deep.  I know it wasn&#39;t a plane, helicopter, or owl.  I&#39;d think it was a shooting star except for the colors.  I knew it was something unusual so I noted the time.<n>

Just befor Three Rivers I spotted this 90 degree contrail being formed. I told my wife and we pulled into a parking lot and I took the picture of it. Latter on near Battle Creek MI my wife spotted the S shaped contrail being formed. I pulled off the road and handed he my camera. She too the photograph of the S shaped contrail. At both times we could not see any aircraft or any sunlite hitting a aircraft. I have reported this event to Linda Moulton How and she has a taped interview with along with the photographs. You can contact her for any further information.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I noticed this right angle contrail in the Eastern sky starting from the zenith down then made an abrupt left hard turn. I had on my yellow night driving sun glasses  as it was overcast. I have seen contrails all my life as we live in the flight path between O&#39;hare and the Detroit international airports. This was the most amazing thing that I had ever seen. The S shaped contrail happened farther down the road near Battle Creek MI. Again this is not normal commercial air traffic. I have aslo taken X contrail photographs. I have been in contact with Linda Moulton Howe and she has a taped interview with me on her WEB page. You mau contact her if you wish. I have been an amateur astronomer for over 30 years and I do know that meteors and comets do non make turns.<n>

I saw a flash  I thought it was lightinging.  But  then a section of the sky lite up like it was day light and a fireball came through the middle.  It looked like it had a tail of fire.  From my location it looked like it went down on the other side of the mountain east of my home . I drove home shaking and asked my family if they saw  the fireball.  But the shades were closed.  I turned up the scanner and one of the county sheriffs was asking if anyone just saw the fireball.  The next day on my way home there was a lot of helicopters flying around the area.  My husband said it must be some kind of  training I said maybe they were  looking for where the fireball went down.<n>

It was at this point the next dorr neighbour who also saw the event went and fetched his binoculars although too late as the ball curved and went off to the south. By the time we went back to the rear of the house and chatted over the fence about what we saw another could be seen far of in the distance coming from the same direction, so the next door neighbour went and grabbed his binoculars again and we just waited for the object to come. It did the exact same thing as the first following the same path, but this time we were able to get a really good look at it through the binoculars. It was just that!A ball of fire, but it had black spots on it were there was nothing.<n>

The object was round and looked like a giant fire ball. The object was bright red with fire coming off of the surface. I saw this fireball in the south eastern part of the sky and it seemed bigger than the moon in the sky that night(which was only a partial crescent moon). I would say it was as big as a full moon when comparing it to the objects in the sky. It definitely was the largest, unidentified object I have ever seen in my life. It was so large I expected to feel some type of impact after it disapeared beyond the outline of the buildings(which were in my way, so I could not see it land or crash).<n>

Noticed the shooting star way above and slowly watched it come down.  As it came closer and closer it didn&#39;t seem to go out.  In fact it started to brighten as it came closer.  After it became bright white it lit up into a fireball with what from my location looked like a 20 to 40 foot tail fo fire behind it.  It traveled down a couple of seconds on fire, then flashed once and blew outward.  Looked like one of those firework displays, except there was not much uniform to the bright white shatter pattern that followed.  Surely there are pieces of this meteor of the ground, it was to close when it blew up not to have left behind fragments.<n>

Approx. 5 min. later I saw one by itself flying in the same direction. 5-10 min. later still I saw another further north of the first 3. ALL were silent. The circular lights were much larger than those I can clearly see on commercial aircraft departing LAX.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was out for a smoke. Looking up towards the LITTLE dipper (I think) I noticed a commercial airline jet leaving LAX (as my job is under the departing flight path for those flights heading east). My location was approx. 3/4mi south of the 10 frwy &amp; 1/10 mi. east of PCH. 5-10 sec. later I saw something I&#39;d never seen before, like no other aircraft I&#39;d known. The TWO aircraft I saw appeared to &#39;chase&#39; the jet from LAX but appeared to be LOWER in altitude than the jet. Each of the two &#34;chase&#34; craft had 5 or 6 circular lights along each edge (not the rear) of the craft. I could&#39;nt believe what I saw.  Convinced I&#39;d seen something truly strange...I stayed outside to see what else I might see. 5 minutes or so went by &amp; YES I saw another one! Flying in the same direction...this thing looked just like the first two I&#39;d earlier seen. Thinking I might miss something I stayed outside for another 5-10 minutes. Then I saw a fourth, but this time something looked like it was chasing the &#39;spacecraft shape&#39; I saw earlier and it was a &#34;pinhead&#34; in size compared in size to the larger craft. All of these craft I saw were the same size as the planes I see departing from LAX. I also live under the departing flight path of LAX as planes head east. I have seen A LOT of planes from LAX &amp; this was like NOTHING I have ever seen before.  I also have lived in the San Fernando Valley &amp; have seen Stealth fighters exit Van Nuys airport when they leave from the yearly airshow. I don&#39;t think these were Stealth. These craft were absoloutely silent, nothing no boom...nothing, yet I can hear just fine all of the jets and prop planes in the area. The circular lights did not blink but remained solid and were much larger than the lights I&#39;ve seen on all the LAX jets...yet the craft was about the same size as an LAX jet. After I saw this FOURTH craft I alerted a coworker, shaken a bit. We watched for 5 min. or so, he went back to work, but I stayed &amp; watched for an hour or so. I had seen all I was to see for the night.<n>

Started moving along road for about 3 min<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first thought it was a helicopter until the three lights I saw were rotating at a rate which a helicopter could not spin and move in one direction.  Slowed down as it got closer and could see a triangle shape wider than it was tall.  The rotating was independent of forward travel as in as it went faster or slower the rotation seemed to be constant.  TAs it turned around and went back the way it came from three helicopters appeared from Fort Bragg direction, one black helicopter and two attack copters, it was dark could not tell what kind.  This gave the final info for me that it was not heli&#39;s, because you could tell the difference.  I turned around and went home which is only about 5 miles from this point.  Got my wife to come outside and bring her telescope, we could not see it again, but the night was filled with the sound of auto cannon fire and machine gun fire.  We may be 40 miles from a base but there is no where around here where they can be shooting off ammo and not hurt someone.  I am a 100% disabled Navy electronics tech, who had a top secret clearence and worked for NASA in the Gulf in there oceano program, first tour in gulf during war I was Tactical Air Nav for Red Sea.  I have never seen anything like this, it scared me to actually see something I could not identify which was so out of the ordinary sceme of any craft I have seen, heard of, or dreamed of.  There are many people who sit outside between Hamlet, Ellerbee, Rockingham, and Mt Gilead and say they watch for UFO&#39;s, and see them frequently.<n>

Upon opening my eyes I saw a very bright light which was a mixture of yellow, orange, and red.  At first I thought it was the cops shining their flashlights, but then I realized they were coming from the sky.  They appeared to be coming from the north, and heading south out into the Monterey Bay.  They loomed above the field for approximately 4:20, according to my swatch watch.  Before they sped away they flashed what appeared to be signals with the lights on their spaceship.  However, we are unsure what their signaling patterns meant.<n>

I believe that I saw what might be otherwise classified as a UFO, however I do believe that it was a man-made aircraft.  I had a very close encounter with this craft.  At the time, I was driving a Chrysler Reliant, and I was heading home driving up the Niagra Escarpment.  The night was very cloudy and a storm had just precipitated.  There was heavy cloud cover, and on my way up a long stretched road heading towards the mountain, I noticed two lights which at first I figured would be a low - flying passenger jet.  However, as I continued up the road, I was surprised to see that the two white lights were fixed above the mountain, and that the jet was much smaller than that of a passenger jet all together.  I was very amazed as I ventured further and steadily closer to this object which I then discovered was hovering at a fixed position.  It then came to my attention that I was about to witness a craft which no one in the public audience has witnessed before.  This craft was at such a low altitude that I lost sight of it while I rounded a turn and could not discern it through the tree tops.  After I rounded the turn, I could clearly see every contour of the craft...  it had just completed a nearly 180 degree turn in the same position... it had a cockpit, with small airleones at each end below it... it had delta shaped wings which came together at the end with a concave curve at the rear... the white lights were at each end of the wing tips.. I stopped my car directly underneath of the craft.  I opened my door and looked up at this craft which travelled less than 5 k/m per hour over my head without a sound.  As shocked as I was, I watched as the craft continued to move until I could see the rear of the craft once again.  Shocked and scared of being a witness to this craft, I drove away.  I write this email in hopes of some response which might explain what I saw.  I do believe that it was man ! made, be cause the craft had two green lights and two red lights on its undercarriage, similar to what is regulation of man made aircraft.  Its undercarriage seemed to have a carry cargo door which I honestly believed would have opened and lifted me inside as I was directly underneath it.  However, this never happened to my recollection.  I have never seen any plane which could maneuvere as this craft can, or hover without a sound.  Please, tell me what this is.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

They would stop then move laterally for a few seconds. They would again move forward, then hover, and move sideways. I went inside to get my binoculars, and to dress warmer, when I returned some 8-10 minutes later, the 2 outside lights had moved. One out of my sight, the other was closer to me and very close to the horizon. It had gotten very bright. A minute or so later, this light moved vertically at a high velocity and stopped instantly. It appeared higher than the two remaining lights (with the red between) which seemed farther off too. I estimate the elevation to be about 5,000 ft, if so the light that shot vertically was travelling around 700 mph. They all eventually moved south and lower until they were out of my sight. I don&#39;t think these lights were helicopters, airplanes, or stars (I compared the lights positions to other objects in the night sky including stars and trees). So what is left? Was this one object with four parts, or four objects anchored together at first?<n>

The cresent moon was bright enough to show the &#39;unlit&#39; protion in silouqete. I then noticed that there was a blinking light near to the lower left of the cresent. It seemed about as far away as the moon itself. At first I wondered if it were perhaps a star that was partly obscured by the moon, but it blinked red,yellowish-white and blue regularly. I informed my brother and his wife to observe it as well. As we watched it for about 5 minutes or so it moved slighly &#34;beneth&#34; the cresent itself. I came home, a drive of a couple of minutes tops, and grabed my binoculars to observe it. It seemed to be in relativly the same position and viewing it thru the binoculars confirmed that the object was outside the orbit of the earth. In fact it seemed to be holding a position close to the moon itself. I continuted to observe it for 10 to 15 minutes and the object maintained its position continuing to flash in the same manner as before. I came in to phone a friend in central Illinois to see if he was able to observe the same thing near to the moon as I, but unfortunatly the moon had set already from his vantage point. I came outside some short time later (about 2140) and the object was still in the sky however its position was further below the setting moon than previously.<n> <n><n> <n><n> See above<n>

I was looking for the Orion constallation, when I saw what I thought were stars moving. They were the same color as the stars (blue tint) , not like a plane marker lights-white or blinking.Living near the Long Beach airport I&#39;ve seen many. As I told my wife and neighbor to look at what I was seeing , I realized that there was no engine noise and they didn&#39;t know where to look. I pointed to the chevron, but it was not bright enough to stand out among the other stars . Still they couldn&#39;t find it in the sky. It had made a path from the southeast to the northwest and was  in the path of a streetlight and now couldn&#39;t be seen without blocking the light with a hand which they didn&#39;t do. I followed it past the street light and the chevron faded out. They looked at me funny not seeing anything. I told them you didn&#39;t see anything but you also didn&#39;t hear anything. Then I pointed out planes in the distance and said but those you can hear. I wasn&#39;t sure what it was, but you would have to been looking directly at it to notice it in the sky<n>

This lead me to believe it was either a large object traveling fast at high altitude with lights missing on one side, or a group of smaller individual lights flying in formation at lower altitude.  I&#39;m going to say it was some sort of stealth plane because I don&#39;t know what it was.  No trail, no sound.  Low enough to make me wish it was higher!<n>

Then it was over us &amp; a wee bit to our left. White lights in the &#34;front&#34; &amp; wings and red lights in parallel rows on the &#34;belly&#34; - nothing beyond that.  No tail! It was very very low and considering how low it was flying it was fairly quiet, it was moving somewhat slowly. It disappeared over &amp; behind the tree tops.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was near 3am on Saturday (4/17/99)morning.  My friend and I were sitting on a blanket enjoying the first warm night, stargazing, laughing, talking, and listening to music.  At the same time we both noticed 2 &#34;headlights&#34; in front of us between the tops of 2 trees.  We noticed the lights becoming larger but then not seeming to move at all.  Like they were just &#34;planted&#34; in the tree tops - then she started joking about &#34;hope they don&#39;t abduct us&#34; and I replied and so forth. Then, I don&#39;t know how, it was to our left a little and up above us so that we could see the lights on the underside.  We saw white light at the front of the aircraft, one, I believe, on each wing.  And 2 rows of red lights running down the &#34;belly&#34; and then nothing.  There appeared to be no more ship beyond that point.  No tail at all.  The object was moving fairly slow, quite low (considering that it didn&#39;t appear to be much higher than the top of a good-sized cedar or Douglas fir and considering how low this was flying, it was not noisey at all.  We watched it go behind the trees which were behind us (the property is ringed by trees all around it) and then disappear.  There was 1 object.  Shape - well, I&#39;ve been questioning if it were a stealth bomber. I guess triangle is best I can come up with.  or manta ray. could not tell the color. Brief description of the observers?  Such as? Me:  Single mother, college-educated, stable (have worked at large reputable law firm for 11 1/2 years), balanced, peaceful, Washington state resident for nearly 12 years.

In the eastern sky we saw a round, red object with smoke behind it.  The object was dropping down.  At first I thought it was an airpline on fire, crashing to the ground.  Then it turned to the right (south) and travelled for several seconds and then vanished.  As it turned the smoke became &#34;squiggly&#34;.

When I glanced again, I noticed what appeared to be another comet shaped object that was larger in diameter than the first, and had a much shorter tail, and looked like it was attached to the other one. They were Blueish/white in colour, and appeared to have flashing lights in the centre. The sky was clear and visibility was good, there was no sound or vapour trail. The object looked like it was perhaps 10x larger than a jet fighter, and was travelling about 5x faster. The object was travelling in a NNE direction. I am a 38year old father of two.<n>

On our way back from the walk we took Scott Boulevard (coming from Herbert Hoover Highway) and turned on Court Street.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There is a gas station right on the corner there and after we had passed it a little ways, we noticed something above us and looked up.  It wasn&#39;t very far up at all, it was close enough to appear bigger around than our heads (I don&#39;t know much about altitudes), and it was totally silent.  All I really remember was looking up at a circle which was just hovering over us, and I saw three round lights in the shape of a wide triangle (they were all closer to the outside than in, leaving the middle black) on the bottom. We, being 13-14 years old (and neither one of us had seen anything like it before) were pretty spooked and didn&#39;t stare for more a couple seconds before we started running.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We ran about half a block to a block and then turned around to take a second look (in curiosity, and also to proove to ourselves that we had actually seen what we did).  When we looked back it was no longer hovering in that spot. In the couple seconds it took us to run away, it had flown off and was way up in the sky. It didn&#39;t change shape or anything, we saw the side of it which looked like a thin oval (as most of the pictures you see of sightings look like), and could still see the three lights on the bottom spaced out to form a triangle.  We stood there for another minute and watched until it was out of site.<n>

My son &amp; I were out of the vehicle, my wife inside the van. The light travelled a horizontal path for about 5 degrees, whe it instantly stopped and reversed course, wising slightly. Then it stopped and apeared to rotate clockwise as the red light seemed to merge with the white light, then quickly wink out, like swinging a flashlight beam in another direction way from your view. The now alone white light began making rapid spiral dips&amp; dives and then darted instantly to different positions in the sky, gaining and loosing altitude. As it dropped lower, we noted multiple very faint smaller red lights drifting slowly to the ground in fan shaped trajectories below the light. We contined observing this for 10 solid minutes, then decided to continue toward Butte. We kept an eye on the light, which continue to dart around for about another 10 minuted before we lost it behind some mountains.<n>

It traveled STRAIGHT down - no arc or angle to it - it was a straight as a telephone pole.  It started out with the red flash but was an oval shaped object first blue-green turning white as it dropped below the tree level.  There was no sound. It was as bright as 3 or 4 traffic lights about 1 block away and much larger than a military airplane.  We have no way to tell starting height nor distance from us. Both my wife and I have seen numerous meteors and shooting stars in the past - this was much different due to the direction of travel - the lack of an arc - again straight down. It lasted between 4 and 10 seconds - I say 6 - 10 seconds and my wife say 4 - 8 seconds. We had our CB radio on at the time and several truckers saw it as well from different angles - most agreed using the words fireball and straight down in their descriptions. There was no trail or after streak to the ball. I can not recieve collect calls here - but would gladly return a call to you so we are paying for the call.<n>

I&#39;d heard that a couple of planets were in alignment and were very bright appearing so I stopped and studied it thinking that it might&#39;ve been those planets. It was a perfectly clear night sky, no clouds but this light had a perfectly round cloud around it. I&#39;d estimate it was 3 times the diameter of the Moon. the light was close enough to nearby trees, chimneys, ets that I could tell it was stationary. In the course of 2 or 3 minutes the cloud reduced in size and visibility as did the bright light in the center of it until it vanished. It was very even how it got smaller and dimmer and staying absolutely round. No drifty breaking up like a cloud would do. I went inside and told my wife about it then got my binoculars and! several minutes later went back out to look around and saw the same exact thing all over again from the same direction except it was maybe twice a s far away and it was quite a bit smaller and dimmer by the time I saw it and it was very close to the horizon of the Mountains (but behind them) and I couldn&#39;t really get any more detail with the binoculars. I should mention that this part of the sky is a flight path for incoming aircraft I assume for SFO International. I&#39;ve been around long enough to know that incoming aircraft with landing lights on move and get bigger, not smaller as they approach and don&#39;t have accompanying clouds. I was an aircrewman in the Navy and have some experience in looking for aircraft in the skies. I described this to a TWA pilot friend of mine and he didn&#39;t have a clue what I&#39;d seen. That&#39;s about it.<n>

It stopped and began to lower toward my car it hovered around 20-30ft above us.  It was silent.  It was enourmous blocking out the entire sky.  It looked like a giant steel I beam with three lights.  One on each end and one in the middle.  There was one in the front and back of the vehicle.  I observed a disruption of light when I looked into it.  Like when you look the road in when it is very hot.  This disruption was reflective because when I looked into (in the front of my car I read my car tag.)<n> <n><n> <n><n> After two or three minutes fear overtook us and we spead away stoppping 100 yards from where we were to see the craft dissappearing from the visible horizon.<n>

Upon reviewing image, I noticed an unknown object that I had not seen when taking the picture.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am a professional person in my thirties and I had borrowed our Sony digital camera from work.  It just so happens that it rained that day at home and the sun came out.  There was such a brilliant rainbow, I decided to take a picture of it.  I took four pictures of the rainbow. Two were both time-stamped 5:55 p.m.  However, in the first, there is this definite object and the second there is none.  It is somewhat fuzzy, but even so, it still looks like your &#34;standard&#34; UFO you see in films and on TV. I have Photshop on my computer and so I saved a copy on my hard drive and tried to isolate the image.  It is definitely something.  Upon isolating the area around the photo, I see beneath the object in the picture another object triangular in shape.  It appears as if the disc shaped object has what appear to be &#34;rays&#34; coming down and falling upon the triangular shaped object.  Very strange, especially since I did not see any of this when I took the photo and also because these objects do not appear in the photo that I took not more than ten seconds later.<n>

It was just getting dusk and I was sitting on the ground looking up at the sky and noticed alot of air traffic which was comming from the south.Suddenly I saw a tiny ball of light comming from the west and looked as if it would hit an airplane. It disappeared right as it approached and I should mention moved VERY fast. There was only one person with me at the time and I asked if she saw it, she did not... then another one!  They moved so fast I had to move my finger with it to show her and even then it was hard to keep up.  The others came out and they started to see them too. These light balls were also taking sharp turns, making loops and spirals.  You thought your eyes were playing tricks on you.  This went on consistantly for about 2 1/2 hours, and an airplane was involved in the majority of sightings.  The last 1/2 hour things died down and my neck was aching badly and it was time to home.  I made a joke about waiting to see the mother ship first and my brother stretched and was looking straight up and there above the house was a football field sized boomerang shaped object!  It was slowly moving to the direction of the airport, did not make a sound, had amber colored lights and at one point seemed to have the points shift so that one side was longer than the other. I kept adjusting my eyes to be sure I was seing correctly.  Then it got to the point we could no longer see it. We all commented that if it had not had lights it would have blended into the night sky undetected.  It has been a few years since this happened so the details are&#39;nt fresh but it is something we will never forget.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate; we have assigned an arbitrary date in April 1999.   A 3-hour long sighting of UFO&#39;s seems highly unlikely to us.  We wonder whether the first lights seen may have been laser-based advertising lights.  We have received many reports about this type of advertising event.  PD))<n>

After the object was not doing the same movements but instead was circuling around and becoming closer and also many times it unmaterialized slowly like if it was showing its power of unsmaterialization. 12 minutes later, it dissapeared. Phisically, after the event, i bagan to feel in my left lung, a sensation of elctrical shots frequently and when this was ocurring I was feeling the sensation of the experience that I lived. Many months later I woke up again with the need of watching the tape and while I was seeing the film, I stopped the image and saw creatures.Two months later, again I reviewed the film and this time I saw a female creature.<n>

Because my tops were off on my car, I noticed a extremely fast green fireball race across the sky overhead moving from nw to se.  The fireball was first noticed just above my head and then flew inside the Washington DC beltway and headed off in the direction of Andrews airforce base.  If the object was at 30000 feet, it would have to be moving in excess of 20,000 mph.  Since it was dark and the object looked like nothing I had ever seen, I could not judge the altitude.  I have watched meteor showers and this was like nothing I had ever seen.  Much more bright and colorful.  Plus, there was no trail like I always see with a meteor shower.  It did look like the object had a bit of green haze around it but not much.  I cannot overstate how bright the object was.  Anyone outside would have noticed it and there had to be other people who saw it.  It moved across about 40 degrees of sky in less than 7 seconds.  It traveled from zenith to 40 degrees where I lost it through the trees but could see it move further se through gaps in the branches and as much as I could keep my car from wrecking.<n>

Orange light then pulsated brighter, then dimmed, eventually dimmed out completely. Duration of sighting lasted approx. 8 minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was out for my nightly walk when I noticed in the southwest sky a bright glowing orange sphere about twice the size of Mars.  The light moved in a northeast direction as I ran back home to get my wife to witness this.  My wife came outside and we both observed (I through binoculars) as the orange sphere released several smaller spheres of light, dropping them downward.  At one point there were at least 3 of these lights dropping at the same time as another light shot up from above the object.  We continued to watch as the light pulsated brighter and then dimmed until it dimmed or winked out.  This is the identical object that we observed on 3/29 at approximately the same time of night.  However, this time the object was not near the airport as it was on the first sighting.  We were not watching a planet, as planets do not travel across the sky and then stop and drop spheres of light out of them.<n>

It stopped on a dime, and changed its direction due east until out of sight.  The objects form was not identifiable.  Take a toy boat, put it in still water, push it forward, see the ripples on both sides of the front, trailing towards the back.  The boat cannot be seen, but the &#34;ripples&#34; are like sparks from a sparkler thrown into the air.  Total sighting time was about 15 seconds.  The sparks were subdued, gold/silver in color.  Not bright like a comet or &#34;shooting star&#34;.  Not the same characteristics.  Too fast for a man made satellite.  I have seen satellites before.

Suddenly an object came out of the sky. At first I thought it was a plane that was going to crash.  The color of it though had a green glow with just a little white at the end of it.  It didn&#39;t look like a ball shape and it had no tail like a comet.  The size from the distance we were at looked about the size of a commercial jet or larger (which is why at first I thought it was a plane.  It fell towards the horizon and then disappeared from our view. I almost expected an explosion from something that size, but there was no sound.  I listened to the news but didn&#39;t hear about a meteor or comet sighting. Do you think that this is what it was? My husband is a college grad and works as a product manager. I work for a temp agency.<n>

I previously thought it landed close by.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I saw what appeared to be a meteor passing by me at possibly subsonic speed descending at an extremely acute angle to the earth&#39;s surface.  Fireball was bluish green (possibly the nickel composition) and a 3 to 400 yard  tail of the same color.  The speed was remarkable considering its acute angle it maintained till it went down.  I thought it hit the ground close to Waples Pond on Route One, but I understand other people saw it land in a field near Lewes; and again I received email from Delaware State News employee saying they saw it pass East of Millsboro, Delaware.  That&#39;s about 25 miles difference; it was difficult to judge since it seemed to be so close to the ground and then the intense light went out.  Since it was dark, I might have lost track of it as it past me due to trees, etc.  At any rate, I called 911 to make sure that they new of a possible impact and/or fire; they probably thought I was crazy.  Many people had to see it, because it was traveling approximately 150 yards south of route 1. The fireball was somewhere between the size of a baseball or larger than a basketball...it was impossible to distinguish by the violent ball of fire.  It was just beautiful and something I will never forget.  Maybe some farmer or some hunter trekking through the field/woods will find it someday and we can recall this moment all over again!  I imagine there is a lot of mass left because it maintained such great speed.  Because of such an acute angle, it either skipped across the ground or left a large gash on the earth&#39;s surface.  I don&#39;t think it can hide forever!  Wish I had time to investigate, check for large burn area, etc...this is a large area to cover.  I talked to radio station and also State newspaper and they&#39;re putting the word out, too. Above statement was used to report to other people I know in Delaware. Since then, I have come to the conclusion that what I saw relative to my traveling south in my car was seemingly close, but may have been several miles away and with a higher altitude.  Nevertheless the relative speed must have been faster than I originally thought.  From what a few people have told me, I have rough coordinates...it may have landed in the Indian River, a body of water in Southern Delaware.  I know more people saw this as it was traveling within obvious view of Route One which heads north and south, becoming route 113 by Dover AirForce Base and north. Delaware State News recommended I report this to you. Please let me know if there were any other sightings beyond Southern Delaware. Thanks in Advance!

We Spotted a Very Fast moving, very bright White Light/Fireball which eventually turned green as it &#34;flew&#34; or dropped closer to earth.   It was fast, and bright. That&#39;s what caught our eye. It was descending toward earth and would dismiss it as a Meteorite but it had no streak behind it. It was very much brighter than approaching airplanes. The flight path that this thing came down on, was the flight path into Kennedy Airport(planes from the West) Several planes were on the same flight path, one every three- four minutes.... one of those pilots must have seen this thing above them , or down ahead, and in front, at this time approximate 23:15- 23:30 April 14th, 1999. The closest plane was just crossing the &#34;Verrazano Bridge&#34; which is the Longest Suspension Bridge in the USA...the pilots would remember the location if they did see it, as it is the major landmark into NYC. It looked to be moving very fast in a downward arc traveling from right to left and also resceeding, southerly and in a downward arc. We only saw it for 2-3 seconds as we do not have &#34;open skys,&#34; here in the &#39;City&#39; ...more like tunnel vision. Judging from where the planes were and the intensity of this lighted fireball, it could have been as far out from us as 5-10 miles out...no telling, due to its brightness, or, as I said it may have been just a meteorite,and the distances would be therefore unknown. It was weird though. No streak. Very Bright White Light that turned green as it moved in the downward arc, and very fast moving. It is indeed unfortunate that we did not see more of its trajectory path to determine if was indeed a Falling Object...<n> <n><n> <n><n> Follow-up response to NUFORC query:<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thanks for your reply...i am surprised that this one was seen in<n> <n><n> Norfolk...that&#39;s due south of New York...and approx 250 miles.<n> <n><n> I was travelling west south west.

It was a partly cloudy night, I was looking up and I saw this object gliding thru the sky, right over head. It was going from southeast to northwest. It was in the sky about half the height of an airliner at 35,000 ft. It wasn&#39;t going very fast. At first I thought it was a sea gull. It looked to be some kind of aircraft. It looked like those  movies I saw on those old flying wings on the Discovery channel. As I watched it,it just glided across the sky. It was gray in color with no other markings. The strangest thing is, it had no lights or sound. It just sailed across the sky. One more very strange thing, about 3-5 minutes later, after I was still shaking my head, a shooting star(or something),very fast, came out of the northest and went in the same direction of this object. That object looked to just burn out.<n>

It was a humid April night. I was helping my neighbor carry his chairs back into his garage when he just stopped moving and looked into the sky. I then turned and looked as well. There was 1 of them. It was an oval shape that was very illuminated. It didn&#39;t have a distinct amount of lights...the whole thing was glowing. We stood there looking at it for a few minutes before reality struck us. Fear spread through our bodies and we ran into the garage to watch from behind a window. We were both in 7th grade so you can understand our fear. The craft just hovered above a house across the street. Ocassionally it would turn a little bit or lower, but it generally stayed in the same place. When I realized nobody would beleive that we saw this thing, I ran home to grab a camera. I came running back to find my friend still in the garage. And as they knew i had a camera they turned quite rapidly and in a matte! r of seconds it was completely gone. Not even a trace of its existance. I didn&#39;t get the picture off in time. That was all.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  There were several sightings reported from Ohio during the spring of 1999, so we do not know which one the witness alludes to.

It came to within few 100 ft. of ground, manuevered uturn and went up and south at rapid speed.  Made no noise, did not flash.<n> <n><n> <n><n> One the evening of April 13, 1999 my sister, 12 year old son, and 9 year old daughter, were outside watching stars.  A neighbor had recently spotted an unusual looking flashing star, and we speculated that it could&#39;ve been a number of optical illusions, he felt it may have been a satellite or other manmade object. Nevertheless, we (me, son, daughter, and sister) were watching the stars that night and I attempted to point out the particular star the neighbor had commented about.  He was on the phone with me at this time (about 8:45 pm) it was dark. I was on my front porch at this time.  I was looking in a southerly direction as he attempted to explain where the star he&#39;d viewed was.  My sister 9 year old daughter and 12 year old son walked approx 500 feet away from the house (south - towards the neighbor&#39;s house) and were looking for the flashing star.  My neighbor had looked at the star with binoculars and I yelled for my daughter to get a small pair we had.  She came to the house to get these, leaving my son and sister still watching the sky.  My neighbor was on the phone still, and as my daughter went inside a &#34;star&#34; moved across the sky and stopped. My neighbor on the phone who was watching for his &#34;odd&#34; flashing star said he saw something move across the sky. I said I had just witnessed it myself, we both felt it looked like a star.  He then said he could no longer see it from his house.  The star had dropped down considerably.  When it first moved it appeared about the size of a dime, and at this time it was much larger, and seemed to be just lower than the hill between my neighbor and me.  My sister and son yelled out &#34;Did you see that?&#34; I yelled back &#34;Yes&#34; I hung up the phone telling my neighbor that we were watching the moving star.  My daughter came out to the front porch about this time, and had just seen the movement she stood there with me for the duration of the event, and consequently did not find the binoculars.  At this point the star seemed to be about the size of a baseball or apple, bu! t was getting larger as it appeared to be getting lower. I yelled for my sister and son to come to the house. The were on there way to the house by this time,  stopping to look back at the star.  My stopped several times,  and seemed quite amaized or even mesmorized by the light. I kept yelling for them to hurry up and I knew my son was stopping to look because my sister was telling him to &#34;come on&#34;. The star lowered and was about the size of a basketball, and began slowly coming towards me,  in a direction I believe is north.  It was slow and paused a couple of times but it just kind of floated or glided towards me. My sister and son had made it back near our front porch and I could see that my son was very curious about the light. It is also puzzling to me and the others that by this point, it seemed to be lighter outside, closer to just after dusk, than dark, but it had been dark (I hope this makes some sort of sense to anyone reading this).  The light came to about 100 feet from us (south of us) and seemed to be lower by a little bit, than the hill top (I should probably explain that we live in hallow)  and stopped breifly - then it made an uturn and rapidle went upward and south and was completely gone within an instant. It may be important to you to know that none of use heard anytning, no engine sounds, wind, or anything else from the orb.  It did not flash in any way, and there was no other color of light associated with it. After the light was gone,  we noticed a lot of planes were flying over, and found it to be unusual.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  One of four reports from same student.  PD))<n>

But the comet made a squiggle (as if someone was holding a flashlight and started jostling it up-&amp;-down rapidly). Then the comet was gone. I dismissed it thinking it may have been a moth, but moths don&#39;t just disappear. This &#34;comet&#34; was orange, was flying in a straight line;then it made a squiggle and just as quickly as it appeared, it disappeared. Vanished. As if plucked from the sky. At this time, it was dark, but there was a street light directly to my left, thus my thought it was a moth that had been flying away from the street light. We&#39;ve had a good view of the stars at night until last night. I did noth bring this to my friends attention as she was facing the wrong way and by the time I could have blurted out the words, it would have been too late. And I didn&#39;t want her thinking I was seeing things.<n>

I believed it could have been an airplane but if so, I would not have seen a steady white light, instead a flashing red strobe would have been visible. It was just before day break so it could be the sun reflecting the fuselage. The reason I tell you this is that I have seen this kind of light before, some years ago now. That light moved to the north at a higher velocity.<n>

It had moved some distance between the time we had first seen it and the time the others arived. the distance of the object from where I was standing, well lets just say I think it wasn&#39;t in the atmosphere.

Not that it has been on my mind since then and have been wondering whether to come forward, it just hasn&#39;t been on my mind recently since it happened so long ago. I was young when it happened (6th grade) I believe it was during spring break (honestly can&#39;t remember though.) I was with my friend sitting on a hill directly infront of my house. We were just sitting there for fun and as we were sitting there we noticed a bright light streak across they sky at a very high angle, perhaps 70 degrees. Neither of us could tell whether it was in the atmosphere or in space. It seems very strange when I look back on the event but my friend started talking to it. &#34;If you are a UFO then streak to the left&#34; and it did so, causing a white streak from right to left. We could not, however, see it when it was stopped, only when it was moving. I was very frightened, but stayed. Eventually both of us were setting rules, &#34;you can pick us up but only if you bring us right back and to this time&#34; because I had seen the movie The Flight of the Navigator before. By the time we had set down the rules we said &#34;you can come and pick us up now&#34; or something along those lines. There was a vertical streak that came from way up in the sky which took less than a second to reach the ground. We couldn&#39;t tell whether it was a large craft that landed far away or a small craft that landed near by. At the time however, we believed it was a large craft that landed in the forest further infront of my house. Either way, both of us were so afraid we went to our homes. We had also mentioned that if they did not pick us up to burn the grass we were sitting on. The next day when we went to the same spot there was no burnt grass, but there was dried out grass everywhere. I honestly can&#39;t say that it wasn&#39;t there before though. I am now, by the way, 17 years old.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

These craft have been observed here for several years now. There is a research facility a few miles south of the lake over which I suspect these craft are. I am seeking a vantage point over this area and will then be able to triangulate the objects to see where they are coming up from and perhaps get a closer look and better tape and stills.<n>

No flashing lights.

At end, object seemed to go directly South, then faded &amp; winked out. A plane in same general area later made obvious sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About 1:10 am, April 8, 1999. Night exceptionally clear (and cold by Southern California standards) I was about to go to bed, but I happened to glance out kitchen window, which looks West. Saw a spot of orange light to SW at about 40 degrees above horizon. I went out on front deck, it was still there, but had moved even in that short time, heading East across South arc of sky. As it was cold, I went in house, grabbed my bathrobe and a pair of binoculars. The object appeared to be about 5 times apparent size of a large star, larger than a light of a plane would be. Color was orange - like the color of those supposedly fog-cutting street-lights (if you know what I mean). There were no flashing lights, just a steady glow. Twice it appeared to drop a series of lights from bottom. The first time, with naked eye, it looked like a shower of sparks. I thought I heard popping sounds, like distant fire-crackers. This was odd, because otherwise, the whole display was absolutly soundless. The second time I had my binoculars on it - it seemed to drop 3 seperate small balls of light, same color as main object. These small lights disappeared or winked out. I don&#39;t remember popping sounds the second time. The object had by this time traversed the sky from SW to a point directly south of me. The movement was not direct and purposfull like a plane, rather, it was more like drifting. At the end, it seemed like it was heading directly South. It faded a few times and then disappeared or winked-out. The only other detail I can think of to mention here is that I seemed to see several spikes projecting from the bottom of the object - this may be an artifact of scratches on my glasses or the general effect of looking at lights in the sky. The whole episode lasted 7-10 minutes. A few minutes later, a plane flew by in the same general area - compared to object, the plane was swifter, smaller, had flashing lights, and made obvious sound. What might it have been? The only conventional explanations I can think of are: 1-- a hot-air b! alloon (these are common in our area as a tourist attraction, thought not at night - I&#39;m sure there&#39;s a law against that for safty reasons); it was silent, the large orange ball effect could have been the fire reflecting off and through the balloon itself, the dropping lights might have been sparks or falling, burning debris. There was no news report today of such an incident - and our local news loves balloon disasters. 2-- a flare drifting on a balloon or parachute, although a flare probably would not appear so large, and why would it be up there in the first place? I was the only observer - only my cat can verify that I was outside with binoculars late at night. Cardiff By The Sea is almost exactly 25 miles North of down-town San Diego and 20 miles or so South of Camp Pendelton, a large Marine Base. We can often hear shelling, and sometimes sonic booms from Camp Pendelton or other nearby Millitary installations. My house is about a mile or two from the coast.  I am a single, University-educated male, age 36.<n>

Another similar light appeared a good distance away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> During a severe thunderstorm, I looked out my office window to the West and observed a singular, very bright, orangeish light above the horizon. I have noticed a similar light there before, and thought it to be a planet. However, we were now in the midst of a strong thunderstorm, and there were no other lights to be seen. I went outside to get my binocculars, and to search the sky thouroughly in an effort to verify that there were no other lights to be seen. There weren&#39;t, and I became very curious about this one. I went back inside to continue to observe this light. As I was watching, Another light instantly appeared a fair distance away from the first one. This second light was identical in every observable detail. The only exception was that this one began to move slowly upward. It stopped for a while, and then it moved again to left. I was periodically observing this light with my binocculars, and After it had moved as described, it then stopped. Now It seemed to have other features. It seemed to have length, because it had other lights on it that allowed me to discern that it wasn&#39;t simply a glowing ball. the first ligh is still stationary at this point. The storm began to subside, and the sky cleared up. I went outside to get a better view. The second object began to &#34;drift&#34; away, until it was out of view entirely. Then, to the right of the first object, another light apeared. Very bright, and it was drifting east, (toward my viewpoint) then it stopped for about 10 seconds. The light that it was eminating was more white than orange, and as I observed it through my binocculars, the light, which resembled a spotlight to me, seemed to become more foccused in my direction, as if the craft was rotating slightly. It then began to move again, and proceeded to fly almost directly over my head. (However, these objects were not close at all, and it was very difficult to view any details) The only description I can give you is that it seemed to be rather long, based, again, on the lights I was observing on the craft. This object &#34;drifted&#34; out of view. When I turned my attention back to the first light, The one I first saw durring the storm, I noticed a much more interesting flying craft: Seen without the binocculars, it very much ressembled the other lights (Bright Glowing Ball) With the binocculars I observed Five lights associated with this craft: It seemed to be a rectangular object, Very large, with white lights at each corner, and a blinking red light in the middle. It seemed to be flying a large holding pattern over an area where there would be no reason to do this. (No Airport) I observed it repeating this pattern twice. Then it disapeared. The first light was no longer vissible when I went back upstairs. I don&#39;t know what all of this was, and I realize that it may be very explainable. But I have never observed such a display. I don&#39;t know what was hovering about, but I would love to speak to anyone else who saw this.<n>

My attention was then caught by a formation of 3 lights flying about 1000 metres up, and about a mile away. The lights then moved towards the car, nearly overhead. There was no noticable noise. Suddenly a new light pulsed once slowly and then shone. This light was three times the size of the others and in the middle of the formation. It was also lighter on the outside than the inside. The object sped away at speed???? Perhaps it was moving at speed anyway. I could not tell whether they were changing altitude, growing???? or just gaining speed. It was very jerky movement. I moved my head over the steering wheel to get a better look. The lights disappeared from my view. I could not see much out of the back window so i could not see it. I continued home. This must have been seen by others as there was a car behind me at the Traffic lights. Although there is a military centre nearby, there is no way that this was a plane, a series of planes, Helicopters, et-al. I dont know what they were. Quite scary. I was terrified all night. I have decided to report this tonight as i heard you on a Radio show on Broadcast.com. Please dont use my name as it will effect my reputation.

We were surprised to see two or three bright spots in the sky. My co-partner who was studying the planet shapes, happened to see a sphere like structure surrounded by what looked like a fog. We could only see the sphere like structures for a few seconds and then they vanished. The night sky was very clear with very few clouds. At first we were unable to understand what they were. In fact, we still do not know. But our most probable guess is that they were UFO&#39;s. We do not have any disk like flying objects in India or in Us. They vanished so fast that the speed of the planes was not like any other normal planes. COuld you please help us to know what were these flying objects?<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We presume the witness implies a sighting in Manitoba, although that is not expressly stated.

I immediately pulled the sheers to the side to have a better look. The lights resembled car headlights from a distance. As the craft approached towards my home, the lights seemed to spread apart. At this point the craft was slightly above maple trees in my front yard. Thats when I saw it had a triangular shape. The bright lights were on the corners of the object, and the wing span was about 37-40 ft long. It also had red pusating lights on the bottom.The speed of the craft was faster than it appeared. It seemed to glide efforlessly over my home with no noise.<n>

It had a brilliant corona effect with white closest to the disc-shaped field of black and then bleeding out into light green and blue pastels.  Underlit by the reddish haze that seems to hang over El Paso, it looked like a round rainbow with a pitch black center as it remained heading south.  In my mind it was momentarily accepted as a meterorite, until it veered sharply back on it&#39;s path heading east/northeast and appeared to go into an almost oval shape as it shot past directly back over the city of Las Cruces.  It should have been visible to anyone traveling on I10 south that morning.<n>

Sky clear with bright stars and large broken clouds.  Five lights were seen in triangular pattern defining angle of about 75 degrees from apex.  Lights were white to bluish white and constant.  Movement was constant in speed and direction.  First impression was that of satellite movement - speed and size of lights similar to satellite observation, but in perfect &#34;V&#34; formation.  Appeared to be at or just above cloud level.  Was travelling parallel to and apparently in/above long cloud bank from NE to SW across valley.  Moved into and out of wisps of this cloud bank during observation. Traversed arc of approx. 25 degrees from my viewing position during about 5 seconds, until it was lost above clouds.  Absolutely quiet.  Unable to discern if this was one object at cloud level or a formation much at much higher altitude, but if it was at high elevation,it was very fast.  If it was lower, it was very quiet.<n>

I have reported this with the local authorities, whom are now investigating.<n>

The sky was overcast, and it was very windy.  The craft was below the clouds, as evidenced by the reflection of its lights.  We stopped our van and looked and listened, hearing nothing.  No props, no blades, no engines.  We turned left onto the street the residence was facing, and as we did so, the craft moved northwest.  We persued it as best we could through the residential area, but in a matter of 1-2 minutes it was beyond the horizon.  We made our way back, and in doing so saw another craft, which at first appeared to be a helicopter, then a plane, then, as we saw it better, exactly like the first.  It made no sound.  Both craft were black, with white lights on the triangle tips and a red light in the center.  Only the first appeared to hover. I am a college student attending William Jewell College in Liberty, MO, and my friend is a high-school Junior attending Rockhurst College in Kansas City, MO. Since seeing the craft, we have witnessed over half a dozen normal aircraft in the area.  Normally, I see none.<n>

I had just gone to bed and was startled by a loud noise and vibration. We thought it was a boat in the river, but it got closer and louder. I got up and my son was still awake so we went outside to look. That&#39;s when we heard the sound of Bell Huey helicopters. Moving from the southwest to the southeast was a ball of light. It was traveling fast! Behind it and going really fast too were two large helicopters. It seemed that they were chasing the light object. We watched until they were out of sight and then went back inside. I returned to bed because I had to get up to go to work this morning. No sooner than I had got back in bed, I heard helicopters again. I jumped back up and ran back outside with my son and we saw two or three more huge helicopters going really fast from the southwest to the southeast.The object and the helicopters seemed to be traveling fairly low about 200 to 300 feet above the treeline. The object was about one third the size of the helicopters. After that I didn&#39;t hear anything anymore.<n>

It seemed to fall straight, then turn or flatten and fall straight again.  This is the second such fireball that we have seen in the past five years.  Although I didn&#39;t document it at the time, it was the same type of fireball.   We are very interested in teh crop circle phenomena and went to England in 1995 and managed to find several on our own.

We didn&#39;t hear a sound from the object. It then started moving west slowly. My father and I then witnessed the object all of a sudden go the opposite direction toward the east. There was no banking/turning for this maneuver! We then saw it speeding up toward the east, a sound was then comming from the sky as we witnessed two jets going very fast, pass overhead. They were not commercial or private aircraft...and there isn&#39;t a military base around here for hundreds of miles. They couldn&#39;t keep up with the object and it left them in it&#39;s wake very quickly.

Some were round, going around the whole sky, I would say about30 miles across. These contrails stayed in sky about an hour, although there was high wind, indicated by fast moving small clouds at a lower level. At about 1600 hours I what I first thought to be an airplain come from the southern horizon at around 25000 feet. It crossed the entire sky in about 12 seconds, which would be a very fast rate of speed considering the height it was at. It appeared to be about the height of the contrails which were mentioned before, although they had disappeared by this time. It was hard to tell the shape because VERY BRIGHT flashes were coming from it at the rate of about 4-5 per second. The brightness of the flashes was MANY TIMES BRIGHTER than a strobe light or light on a plane, which would not have showed up because of the bright sunny sky. It was as though a mirror was aimed at the sun and reflected back to me. I might add that there are many commercial airlines flying over this area and the ones that fly over are almost all east to west (Detroit to Toronto) and take the usual 3 - 5 minutes to fly over at that altitude.<n>

It was traveling very slowly (slower than most prop planes-less than 200 mph).<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was a small blue ight.  I had just steped outside and saw it.  At first I thought it was a satalite.  But it was too bright as the sky was not that dark.  i called my girfriend outside, she saw it too and suggested it might be an airplane.  I am in the Air Force and I could tell that it wasn&#39;t behaving like a normal prop plane.  the single constant light, the percieved altitude (10,000 ft) didn&#39;t seem to be typical of the normal aricraft that are present in the area.She agreed that it didn&#39;t look like an airplane. She said, &#34;wow, I don&#39;t know what that would be.&#34;  I said that I was going to go down stairs to my apartment and look at it through my roomates binoculars.  the object was traveling slowly so I would have enough time.  I ran down stairs fumbled with the lock opened the door, grabed the binoculars (35x), and went out on the back deck(the object had traveled over the apartment by now).  I could hear my girlfriend discussing the object with her roomate on the deck above me.  I looked at the object through the binoculars and it didn&#39;t reveal anything more.  I saw no craft or airplane as I was half expecting to see.  It looked like a star would look under a telescope, just a point of blue light moving across the sky.  the poit was much sharper and smaller under the power of the binoculars but that was the only change.  I then reached up to the deck above and handed my girlfriend the binoculars and let her look at the object. when the object had traveled most of the length of the skyand was slowly moving away, it suddenly dissapeared.  It just faded out and was gone.  My girlfriend remarked, &#34;that was weird!&#34;  I said, &#34; I think that was a UFO.&#34;  through out the event the object made no sound as the other aircraft in the area were.<n>

My cat&#39;s nightly ritual is, she then jumps up next to me to get her bellly scratched. All of the sudden she flips over and looks at the wall. Her ears went straight up, so I looked at the wall to see what had her attention. There was a beautiful light the size of a baseball with a halo around it. The bright light danced on the wall for a few seconds, then it shot straight out my window. I live on the third floor of my apartments and my windows are heavily draped, including a black out shade that was pulled down. My cat was so freaked out. It took her a least 15 minutes to calm down. I jumped up and turned the computer off. Was it a UFO or something spiritual?  Who knows.<n>

There were not many cars out we saw it while driving.  It moved very fast then stood still then went the other direction.  We saw it high in the sky then as pulling into our subdivision it dropped came towards us and put a light on us.  Frightened with our children in the car I told my husband to leave immediately.  Been trying not to think about it until months later. My husband saw the same thing, but will not dicuss it.<n>
4/4/99 21:30|Bainbridge Island|WA|Unknown|2 minutes|Someone in my bedroom, at least 3, and one touching me on the front where the crease of my neck is, my body tingling|5/24/99|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/007/S07144.html|150|ndxe199904| ((NUFORC Note:  We talked with this person.  This report appears to be submitted by a very reliable source.))<n> <n><n> <n><n> Someone in my bedroom, at least 3, and one touching me on the front where the crease of my neck is, my body tingling<n> <n><n> <n><n> I went to bed early, 9:00 p.m., I thought I woke up but could have been asleep.  I felt that there was a person in my room.  I heard faint talking and then I realized that there were about 3 people, I thought men, in my room.  I was scared and my heart was beating fast.  I felt paralyzed and couldn&#39;t turn to look.  I was so scared I was afraid of looking.  I was sleeping on my right side with back towards the windows and they were standing behind me.  I felt hands come to the front of my neck, right where the crease is.  The hands or tips of the fingers touched there, resting on the crease.  I felt my torso tingling.  The phone rang and I completely woke up and was thankful.  I told the person on the phone what had happened.  I also told other people because it was so real to me.  One person mentioned that it sounded like an alien encounter.  Two weeks past the incident I went in for my annual check-up and the nurse left a message on my phone to contact them about my lab results.  I have always been in perfect health except for skin cancer and tooth problems.  I called and she said that my blood showed that I had a hyperthyroid and that I needed to come in for tests.  I was totally shocked.  However, the next day the occurrence of what happened two weeks prior came to my mind and the placement of the hands.  They were placed on my thyroid.  I go in for tests on May 11.  I still don&#39;t know for sure if it was a dream or reality but to me it seemed very real.  Not too many things frighten me but I was very scared and felt there was something going on behind my back (no puns intended).  I witnessed a UFO sighting in 1966 - saw the craft up close and thought that maybe they are tracking me.  I have never reported my sighting until now.  The person that saw the UFO with me is now dead but the last time I was with him we talked about it.  The craft we saw was huge with no sound and hovered above us and above the trees.<n>

I kept an eye on the object and as i was near my home i went back to tell my wife about it.The object was still very visible at that time so she came out along with our 3 children and observed it to.The object was intensely bright orange and gave off a sort of halo around it,it cruised at an even pace,and made no sound at all.There was no blinking lights nor anything else to indicate an aircraft.As it was dark at this time it looked very bright and im sure other people must have seen it.from our position it seemed to be heading north west.this lasted about ten minuits or so.at the end of the event it seemed to be going higher.I think the thing that struck me most was the brightness of it,and the steady pace it kept,not fast nor slow just even.<n>

At first, it looked as if it were a plane or helicopter with fog ligths on, but the way that the lights were moving suggested something else.  Th &#34;fog lights&#34; went around, searching, in a cricular motion.  As the craft was doing this, it seemed to be travelling upward, at a high speed.  Then, all of a sudden, it changed directions and headed in a southwestern direction, then dissapeared.<n>

The intensity of the light fluctuated and was mostly white. However, on the left side, it sometimes appeared tinged in blue or blue-green. My wife also saw a tilted disc shape to its immediate left with what appeared to be light dots inside. We observed this object from our porch for several minutes. During this period it also moved slowly to the right a few degrees then stopped briefly before moving vertically several degrees. Later when I left for work I noticed the light was lower on the horizon and had moved about 45 degrees to right(north)..<n>

It was moving from E-SE to W-NW. Itried to see the source of this contrail, but it was too, too high to see. That&#39;s when I started to question it&#39;s origin. It was moving too fast for a plane that was that high(far away). At the next stop in traffic(app. 45 sec.), I watched it cross in close proximity to the Sun. It was hard to keep it in view at this point, so I waited for it to come out the other side of the Sun&#39;s influence. It never appeared again, and I then went to look back at the beginning of the trail. It was nowhere to be seen.<n>

The objects were traveling East to West and appeared to be glowing a peach color and were about three times as wide as they were long. There was no sound or flashing lights and the objects appeared translucent. I took the binoculars from my eyes and could not see the objects. I looked through the binoculars again and could see both objects clearly. I followed the objects until I lost them behind a tree(about 10 seconds). The objects were traveling at a  high rate of speed. For a size estimate I say this, If the objects were the size of a small airplane, they would have been about three miles away. Looking the direction where I saw the objects, I see many aircraft on a flight path toward Houston,TX. These were NOT airplanes. My first thought was &#34;what the hell is that?&#34;. I have never seen anything before that I would call a UFO and could be viewed as some what of a non-believer. I&#39;m not sure what these objects were but I know what they were not.<n>

A very bright luminous amber spere was observed from the second story of our home. It was traveling East, just above tree top level and although the distance was difficult to judge because the size is unknown my wife and I both got the impression it was fairly close (50 - 300 yards away). We opened the window and could hear no noise. The sky was overcast but the object was well below the level of the clouds. The object was perfectly round or spherical but appeared to have very small spikes or rays around the edge. It moved behind trees and we could no longer observe it.<n>

We note that the date indicated is 01AP98, a.k.a. &#34;April Fool&#39;s Day.&#34;  We hope this report is not intended as a hoax.))<n> <n><n> <n><n> Strange Brush fires near Verazanno Bridge<n> <n><n> <n><n> I moved to Bay Ridge, Brooklyn in the Spring of 1997 and have since noticed that brush fires are a common occurence on Staten Island near the old fortress.  I have never associated these fires with anything other than dry brush until April of this year.  As we were returning home my fiancee and I noticed a rather large fire that was in the shape of a near perfect rectangle roughly a quarter of a mile high, with a smaller circular fire off to the right of the rectangle.  Standing on Shore Rd. in Brooklyn you could clearly see the red rotating lights from the fire engines on scene but the location must have been a challenge as there is aparently no access to the area, the land on either side of the bridge is a very steep grade that does not allow any vehicle parking much less a fire engine and there is a great disance between the water and the portion of the hill that was on fire. We agreed with two other people wathcing the fire from Shore Rd. that it was peculiar place and time of year for a spontaneous brush fire and that it must have been intentionally set. But by whom? Unless a passenger on a passing ship was able to throw a huge molotov cocktail a distance of approx. 7500 feet it was difficult to imagine how this could have been accomplished.  My fiancee suggested that it may have been set by a ufo during takeoff. Given all that occurred, that sounded more plausible than any other explanation.  I was not aware of the numerous sighting in that particular area of Brooklyn until I read other reports listed in this database. Perhaps this occurrence was related.<n>

WHEN IT FINALLY STOPPED, IT WAS OUT OVER THE OCEAN, AND LOOKED A LITTLE BIT SMALLER IN SIZE, BUT JUST AS WHITE AND JUST AS BRIGHT. IT THEN MOVED UP IN THE SKY TO ABOUT A 45 DEGREE ANGLE FROM THE TERMINATOR OF THE EARTH FROM OUR VIEW. IT MOVED UP RAPIDLY AND THEN HEADED WEST AND UP AGAIN AND THEN DISAPPEARED.

One night about a week ago while driving home from work I saw this same object in the north western sky while northbound on I-5,  It was moving almost as a helicopter would but it was orange with no other color lights that I could see.  It was only a mile or two off of the coast of north San Diego County and I thought it was a planet at first but the orange object was circling in the sky over a distance of several miles perhaps,  I have 20-15 vision with both eyes and I had my window open and saw it clearly.  I waved to it and said to the object &#34;hey fellars come on down&#34;  then I got a strange feeling as if the occupants heard me and were amused<n>
