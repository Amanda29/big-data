I chased after the dog, caught up with him at the back yard fence, and picked him up.  I was facing west.  The dog was facing me, pawing at me and trying to lick me.  I jerked my head back and held the dog out from me.  Consequently, I looked upwards and saw a &#34;V&#34; formation of seven large luminous, pale yellow disks just coming up from the west side of town, and heading east, and disappearing over the eastern horizon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I cannot comment on how high they were, nor can I comment on how large they were.  They appeared to be huge, and were featureless.  The disks made no sound.  The disks appeared to be very close to each other.  The formation did pretty much fill the sky as they went over my head.<n> <n><n> <n><n> No one whom I was acquainted with witnessed this event.  It was not reported in the local paper (Tri-City Herald) nor was it mentioned on the local radio stations.  I did tell my father what I saw, and he did not believe me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was 16 years old at the time of the sighting, an honor high school student, and a member of the Civil Air Patrol.  I am now 74 years old, own and manage a medical trancscription business, and I have a BS Degree in Electrical Engineering.  Looking back on this event, I think my description of what happened is accurate.<n>

I was working in the oil fields at the time and we had shut down the ditching machine for the night. Now as you know after operating a machine like this all day, when it is shut down,the stillness you can cut with a knife. We were in an area that was clear of any objects, only low willows and rolling hills. The evening sky was clear as a bell, not a cloud to be seen, a typical fall evening. The time was about 17.00 hours, the month was late sept or early oct. I cannot be sure. there was no oil rigs working in the area that we were at nor was there any flare pits burning anywhere near us. As we started back down the right of way that we had cut through,to get back to the half ton truck to go back to camp, this is what we saw. We were walking east and out of the north and going south came these 2 objects, they were cylinder in shape with one just above and ahead of the other. they both glowed like the red ember of coal but the out line of the cylinder was sharp,not fuzzy. they did not appear to be that high, not traveling all that fast. we both had a good look at them as they went by. It scared the Hell out of me as well as the chap I was working with. Oh before forget they did not make a sound. As I look at him and he look me this is what he said, When we get back to camp don&#39;t you open your mouth to anyone as to what we had just seen, and I did not talk to anyone for years about this as in those days they would have thought you were nuts. Even now when I bring up the subject which is not often I get that &#34;who ((deleted)) look&#34; from people. Even when putting this info down I can still se them and the goose bumps go up my spine and the hair on the back of my neck goes up. I am still spooked by this experence. I do not know what more I can add to this statement other than you can&#39;t tell me there is no such things as U.F.O.&#39;s I still live with the two I saw. I hope I have done this information right for you folks because what I have written down here is not a cock and bull story, I swear on the bible it is true. Well thank you and also George Noory who&#39;s program I listen to every night when I can pick up the station, and the gentleman he had on tonight as well  yours truely  ((name deleted)) (spud)<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

10/15/52|Edmonton (southwest of) (Canada)|AB|Cylinder|approx. 2 min.|Good evening folks---What I am about to discribe is what I saw back in 1952,in an area that is about 75 to 80 miles southwest of the ci|1/17/04|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/033/S33965.html|3|ndxe195210| 1952 daylight sighting of multiple discs in formation<n> <n><n> <n><n> In the early Fall of 1952, I was on the playground of my grammar school in Kansas City, MO, when I happened to glance eastward at the horizon. I saw a very large number of disc-shaped UFO&#39;s glinting in the sunlight.  As I watched in astonishment, the objects passed directly over my head and continued onward until I lost sight of them, in all an event of about 90 seconds.  I had the good sense (even as a 10-year-old) to punch a nearby playmate and point upward.  He saw them too.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After school the two of us went to my house and called Richards-Gebauer AFB to report on what we had seen.  About two or three weeks later, two Air Force officers came to my school and I was called out of class and interrogated by them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> First, they asked me how many objects there were and I said about a hundred.  They were obviously shocked and, intimidated, I said maybe there were fifty.  I have always believed the number to be closer to a hundred.  I explained that the discs flew in perfect formation, in what I would today call a chevron formation.  I also explained that they did not fly in an uninterrupted, straight-ahead motion, but displayed a yo-yo motion, almost as if they were intaking air to propel themselves, then resting momentarily before the next intake and move forward, and so on.  This they did in perfect unison.  The two officers were skeptical and asked me if I knew what ducks look like in formation.  I made a V with my fingers and refused to go along with the duck hypothesis.  Then they told me that &#34;these things are usually reported in two&#39;s and three&#39;s, not in large formations.&#34;  They asked if anyone else saw the event, and I told them the name of my playmate, who was sitting in his classroom, not 100 feet from where we were sitting.  They then said they had all the information they needed and left without interviewing the other boy.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Over the years, I have read much of the published UFO literature and have found only one sighting that somewhat resembled my own--that of a U.S. soldier in the South Pacific in 1942.  He also saw a large formation of disc-like objects, which at one point made a loud rumbling sound.  In my case, there was no detectible sound.  The amazing thing is that there were at least 100 children playing on that playground, and as far as I was able to determine at the time, no one else noticed this obvious intrusion into the skies above our school.  Had I not thought to signal my playmate, even I might have concluded that I saw an optical illusion.  But it was no illusion.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On a couple of other occasions, years ago, I attempted to contact other UFO organizations, but no one got back to me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Now I am 66 years old and feel strongly that I want some permanent record of what I saw to exist after I am gone.  I would also like to explore whether the record of my Air Force interrogation still exists, though I doubt it.  I have always felt very privileged to have had this unusual sighting, at the same time frustrated by the official disinformation campaign that obviously is still going on.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.

10/1/52 12:00|Kansas City|MO|Disk|90 sec.|1952 daylight sighting of multiple discs in formation|10/31/08|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/065/S65839.html|4|ndxe195210| After being alerted to some excitement outside of my com center, I quickly locked my duty room and went outside to see the problem only to see approx 25-38 men all watching the sky out over the flight strip the the left of the control tower.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It is belived that the object was some 10k to 15k ft altitude.  It at first sighting just seemed to float in a set area not moving at all then suddenly it moved diagonally at some 30 to 45 degree angle up then stopped momentarily then without even a gradual change in direction is just suddenly moved straight across the sky and eye blinking speed so some 10 miles it was believed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Again it did this same move only in a completely different direction more then just abruptly.  It moved at the speed of light but all moves were done in  absolutely reverse moves. This went on for some 20 minutes,<n> <n><n> <n><n> Finally 3 F-86s were dispatched for observation for encountering and they could not even get close to the object.  We all knew that it was a UFO becuase of former warnings not to ever discuss what if ever we should see in the sky.  It was told to us all that there were no such things as flying saucers ant that they were only figments of out imagination.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We all knew better that that.  Most of us had all read or heard of the &#34;Project Blue Book&#34; (Major Keyholes Report, which was printed in 1947.)<n> <n><n> <n><n> We had never hoped to see something of this magnitude but after seeing this we all felt sure of what we had seen.  I had went into operation shack and had asked questions as to what they had seen on the Radarr scope and was answered that they could not ID the object because it speed would not be calculated on thier screen but did note that when the F-86s ever got near the objects area, it would move so fast it could not be registered on the scope.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They did say however that they did know it was something but of an unknown craft and that there was not any place on the planed earth that could even possibly have anything like what was seen or acted on their scope.  The whole subject was ordered to be silenced  and not even discussed but of course we did at some risk of violation of orders.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This was the most fantastic thing I have ever seen in my life, this thing moved several times this was until then it literally in a flick of an eye shot out of sight just as though it was like a light switch being turned off.  I disappeared as fast as it was believe to appear.  Literally disappered.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My theory is that this thing can control magnatism in some way as well as crontrol its stability at will. It definatley was and is being control by some intelligence. I have  tried to make this know before but to those I have expressed, they would look at me as if I was nuts. I and we know what we seen and it all true. I was a A/1c (buck Sgt) at the time stationed at Itazuke Air Force Base on the Island of Kyushu Japan during the Korean War. There were no dummies stationed there. We were all skilled in what we did and were proud of who, and what we were but this was astounding to say the least.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thank you.
