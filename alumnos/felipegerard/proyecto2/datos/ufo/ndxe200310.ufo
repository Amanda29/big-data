By the naked eye I can see them move sporadically like an insect.  With binoculars, it&#39;s a lot clearer.  They change colors, red - white - and blue.  Often they are triangular in shape.  Often they emit beams and one night I saw little crafts going off of what appeared to be the mother craft.  They are generally in the same area.  There is an AF base in Tucson, i.e., Davis-Monthan.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We observe that the description of the objects is not inconsistent with that of &#34;twinkling&#34; stars, but that is only a guess as to what the witness observed.

The event that took place was like nothing either one of us had ever seen, I believe in U.F.O&#39;s and i kno that what i had seen was NOT normal, we had been walking home and we came to the edge of the dirt road where it had turned into pavement, my friend stopped walking and looked to the sky, at this time i had turned around and and looked up to see what he was starring at.I then observed a triangular object with a bright non blinking lights at each of its pionts, the object was very large and it was not transparent, it was a large craft of somesort, while we were looking at the object neither of us spoke we just stood there in amazement the craft was moving but very slowly then it spun around and dissapeared, we went back to his house and told his family what we had witnessed, but ofcourse with it being halloween, nobody had ever believed us. But i know what i saw and so did he and its something that we will never be able to explain and definatley will never forget.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

We noticed a large object with 4 large white circle lights kind of hovering over the air.  The two of us both saw it at the same time and approximately 5 seconds after we spotted it, the 4 white lights went off and one of the lights turned green.  Then all lights disappeared and the 4 white lights came on again.  Although it looked like a rectangle from the side, when it started moving at a very fast rate, we saw it actually looke dlike a triangle.  It started to go over some trees then just completely disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It seemed to stop rising just above the tree tops..Then the white lights changed to color lights -red, blue ,white-and heading right at me, north.. no sound, and just floating slowly.

We stopped to get a better look and when I got out of the car the lights dissapeared. We got back in the car and started back down the road when the lights reapeared one by one. We stopped again got out then they went out again. We couldnt hear or see anything when the lights went out when the lights were on it was cigar shaped and 5 huge white lights, the objest looked to be about 5 football fields long. That night there was a dance in town after the football game and my daughters way that kids at the dance were talking about the strange lights also.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date of sighting may be approximate, although the witness does not indicate that fact.

I actually was checking to see if anyone saw what I saw on the same night in Hamilton, Ontario.  I saw a similar craft, from a great distance (at least four miles), over Hamilton on Haloween night (friday).  There were thousands of people in the streets at this time, so others may report it.  At first I thought it was an airplane, as there is an airport in Hamilton.  However, this craft was lighted all along the length of the craft, unlike an airplane, and it had some blue, red and white lights, flashing, within the overall white/blue light of the craft.  It struck me right away that this may be an aircraft..but I&#39;ve never seen one lit up like that before, and we have them here all the time.  I attempted to get to a better vantage point quickly, but had to proceed with caution since the streets were filled with children.  When I got there, the object was gone.  Our airplanes do not have blue lights?  Our airplanes do not light up so you can see them at night...only their nav lights and headlamps.  Aura is a very good description of the type of lighting I observed.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

As witnesses looked up overhead, it suddenly took off and disappeared, seemingly moving into the eastern sky (you could not see it go off into the distance, it just seemed to disappear).  Thought it might have been a craft from Whidbey Air Naval Base.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

She noticed 2 white lites moving from the southeast to the northwest, toward us. The lites appeared as bright as large aircraft landing lites.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As the lites got closer we could make out a black circle between the 2 lites as there was a moon and a white hase in the night sky. The lites were 180 degrees apart. As it can almost over us we could make out the lites were circuler and pointed in the direction of travel. Just before passing over us the object slowed to a stop. There was no sound. We could not tell how far away the object was but it seemed close, 2 to 3 hundred yards. No detail could be make out on the craft, only blackness. The 2 lites turned approx. 45 degrees counter-clockwise flashed a orange/yellow color and moved slowly away to the south with the lites pointed north. As the craft moved away the lites dimmed and as it moved further away the lites went out, but we could still make out the black circle moving south until it disappared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have worked as a quality assurance inspector for major oil companies for the last 30 years.

I was on a bicycle, on my way to work when I saw it and astounded, turned around to look at the car behind me. It was a taxi cab, and as the driver approached the nearby stop sign, he pulled over and asked if I saw that.  I said I had, and did he know what it was?  He did not, but I was happy to not have been the only witness to a very odd light in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I live near the airport so just assumed them to be airplanes at first.  The noises sounded like airplanes coming in for landing, but there was no sound of engines just that of something moving through the air quickly.  I&#39;ve lived near the airport most of my life, so I know these were unusual noises.  About five minutes after I first heard the noises a new noise came to me.  At first it was distant, a few blocks away, but soon it was near enough to be over my neighbors across the alley.  It sounded like something hovering.  It grew near till it was extremely loud, paused for 30 seconds to a minute and then slowly went away.  There was another similar hovering noise, but it seemed fairly distant.  Honestly I was too scared to get out of bed, not to mention too cold, so I stayed in bed for nearly 10 more minutes before I woke my fiance and told him what I had heard.  You could still hear the sound of something travelling the sky without a jet engine, but there was no more hovering.  Around 4:30 you could finally hear actual Jet engines either taking off or landing, so no more anomaly like noises for the night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We do not know what the witness heard, but we wonder whether it might have been the vortices in the air, generated off the tips of landing airliners.  They can be quite loud, and they are eerie in nature.  PD))<n>

I mean, thats what it looked like to me, lights, red, orange, green, blue, yellow and white. rotating under and around the side, Many more lights than any conventional, night flying, airplanes would have on.  Not real bright though, like christmas tree lights rotating.  No sound, eriely silent, AND moving in more of a hover, almost a slight wobble from too low a speed. It had to be enormous in size, I guestamate, I was 1 - 2 kilometres from it, then it passed behind a building. This would have been visible to anyone outside at 3am, near English bay, Stanley Park area. Its altitude was very low, a few hundred feet I think, over the water at English Bay.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I came out the door, lit up and looked at the sky with a lot of stars out. I noticed a large blank spot amongst the stars and noticed the blankness was moving at a very slow pace. It was in the shape of an off &#34;V&#34; shape. It was an non reflective deep black. If someone was to just glance up would not notice it. It had six round white lights on the long side and four on the other side. I would say an estimation of size to be at least 20 blocks from wing tip to wing tip if that was what it was. It made no sound and seemed to just glide moothly through the air. It was about 200 feet about me. I watched and kept backing up to watch it. It passed over until the higher side of the hospital blocked my view. so I stepped to the other side of the patio to see where it went but it was like it vanished.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The craft then took a 90 degree turn straight down toward the ground and disappeared. From where we were it looked like it would have hit the ground in West Melbourne or Palm Bay. The entire event didn&#39;t last 5 seconds. From that far away it still looked to be a pretty big craft not 100 feet across but bigger than a helicopter. What made us think it was a ufo was the 90 degree turn at very high speed not that far off the ground I was expecting to see the ground light up from the crash but nothing happened.

It was one craft and it had a metal look and was gray or like a dark grey.and it made NO sound as it was flying. It was shaped like a V and it looked streem lined. It had large orangey colored light`s along the bottom of the craft. This I have NEVER seen before in my life, I could see the HEAT vaper coming of the lights and the craft and It looked HOT!! I would say it was about 3/4 mile away from me. It looked like it was flying at about 600 feet (est).<n> <n><n> <n><n> I saw this craft as I was sitting on my belcony at night in the front of my house with clear sky`s. And I watched this craft fly low and slow infront of the mountins,  it flue over the bay in a strait line till it got to the end of the bay it turn left a little. Then I lost sight of it after it went behined the trees that are in front of my house. This sighting lasted about 35 seconds.<n>
10/30/03 23:00|Scappoose|OR|Triangle|5 seconds (x2)|2 more fast, noiseless, triangular objects seen above Scappoose, OR within 1 week of first sighting|10/31/03|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/032/S32790.html|22|ndxe200310| 2 more fast, noiseless, triangular objects seen above Scappoose, OR within 1 week of first sighting<n> <n><n> <n><n> The description of these 2 events are similar to that which we reported last week. Both craft were fast moving, much faster than a small prop plane low or a jet plane high, but much slower than a meteor. No prop or jet sound was heard. Both craft were hard to track, because again it appeared that the &#39;lights&#39; on the craft were more reflective than self-luminous. No Northern Lights were seen all night, probably due to the skyglow from Scappoose, of which we live on the southern end. The first craft was traveling from NW to SE towards Portland. The second craft was seen about 1 minute later traveling from SW to NE. Both were seen as they travelled away from us. The first craft had a &#39;light&#39; at the front and 4 or 5 on each of the swept sides, but the trailing edge, if it was there, was completely dark. The second craft had only three lights, one at the front, the others at the trailing tips. The sky last week was overcast, the sky this week was completely clear, yet neither time did we actually see a shape to these craft. The shape was determined by the placement of the lights only. They could have been triangular or chevron shaped. We both find it quite odd that with as much time as we spend outdoors at night, we have 3 sightings within a week, yet none for the previous 8 years here. As a side note, my dad, who is an published astronomer and recently gave a talk on Mars at Princeton, told me a few days ago that he saw an identical object in 1956 in Pennsylvania. He saw the same, quiet triangular craft moving noiselessly at extreme speed with a pale light at each tip. He says it was translucent and observed stars through it.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I looked up in the sky because we had heard some people were seeing the Aurora lights. I was disappointed that I didn&#39;t see anything. Then coming out of the NW, I saw a strange looking object. It was a triangular like object (when I drew out what I had seen it was like an upside down kite in shape). There were 4 lights that were visible to me-one in the front, 1 in the back, and 1 on each side. They were yellow lights, and they were not blinking as in most commercial aircraft.It had come from the NW, and it appeared to be heading SE as it went over my home. As it went over my home, it appeared to quickly turn a little more the East instead of going just straight to the SE. The craft appeared to move like it was gliding, but it was so quick. There was no sound coming from it. It was a very clear night out. The stars were shining. There was a light breeze. The object was hard to estimate how high that it was. It appeared to be 500-1000 feet or so. If I held my fist up in the air, it appeared to cover it. That is the best way I can describe how high up.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was traveling very fast and low, and I thought it might crash into the hills.  The pick-up truck in front of us must have seen it too, because they pulled left off the road (there was a turnout for semi-trucks on the left hand side of the road).  They (I could tell there were several people in the truck) positioned their truck facing in the direction of where the crash site might have been.  While I kept driving, my husband looked for signs of smoke or a fire from a crash (the vegetation is tinder dry, and anything can start a blaze right now).  He saw nothing.  The truck that pulled off, finally came back on the road and passed us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Background:  I have a masters degree in Organizational Leadership.  My husband was looking down at the time, and he did not see the green object (earlier in the day, he had a minor procedure for treatment of a heel spur, and the doctor had given him a mild sedative).<n> <n><n> <n><n>

And while i was lying on the ground next to her i saw some lights in the sky, but they were not the kind of lights you would usually see on an airplane at night. So i sat up and told her to look at the sky then thats whenwe came to think it was a UFO, because it could&#39;nt possibly belong to the USA. Then the light got brighter. As it came closer i felt fear in my heart, i&#39;d say it was about 10 feet away from us. We tried to run but we could&#39;nt move i tried to move but it was as if someone or something was controling us. My friend could&#39;nt move either, she could barely even speak fom the shock. Then all of a sudden they left and it felt as if we were there for thirty minutes but i realized we were only there for 20 to 30 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

I was wondering if I should or not.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The sighting took place in Findlay Ohio on Oct. 30 2003. Me and my girlfriend live in Perrysburg. We use to live in Findlay but moved recently. Well we went to my mom and dads place for trick or treat.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After trick or treat was over. Dad and a neighbor of thiers were sitting on the deck in front of the house. Me, mom, and my girlfriend were in the house. Dad called for us. When we got outside there was something strange in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We saw it between 9:00-9:30pm. We caught see anything but lights. It was moving fast in a north to north east direction. We thought it was a jet at first but there was no engine sound. It was very low. But you couldn&#39;t hear any engines. We heard nothing not even a humming noise.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It had a bright light at the front and at the back of it. It had a red flashing light in the middle of it. That was all we could see. I followed it from the front of the house to the back yard. I went as far as I could. Dad has a fence up to keep out unwanted people and animals. I lost it as it went behind some trees.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As me and my girlfriend headed back home. I was looking for it as we went up the highway. But it was gone. We don&#39;t know the exact shape. All we know it was strange and it moved and turned fast. An airplane or a jet couldn&#39;t turn this fast or move as fast as this did.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was we got to see it with more light. So we could see the shape. Still til this day. I wish I could see it again.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I noticed some movement though it was slow and purposeful. It was bright red - which is why I thought it was some type of aircrafe -  and seemed to oscillate in its luminosity. It would grow brighter and larger then reduce in luminosity and size in no apparent pattern. We used a cheap Camcorder with a slight zoom lens to see a closer picture of whatever it was and it appeard in the small LCD as a red disk. After about ten minutes time it just dissappeared. About 90 seconds later in another part of the night sky - what appeared to be a shooting star appeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I automatically said &#34;It&#39;s one of those planes that leave streaks in the sky&#34; until I realized it wasn&#39;t moving at all, it was just a bright orange oval shape hovering in the sky. We stopped the car to get a better look, but then continued down the road to the house. My neice and I grabbed the binoculars and hopped on our bikes, but once we got back down the road where there were no trees obstructing our view, the object was totally gone without a trace. The wispy clouds hadn&#39;t changed much, so we&#39;re not sure if it was a trick of the light or what.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Every few seconds the color would change to red for a while. By now i had my camcorder and was filming away. By now, everyone else was watching too. All of a sudden, the sky around the lights turned bright red. This part lasted for about 5 minutes, then it was over. i have the whole thing on tape.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  NUFORC received a telephoned report of a similar report of a cluster of lights near Carrollton, GA, seen at approximately 2100 hrs.

I drove to a place where I could park my car and watched the disk.  It started to move slowly to the west.  I got back in the car and drove the 4 blocks to my house.

It wasnt a bag because it was too high up for a bag to be that high (a very faint wind)The sky was mostly clear and sunny but yet setting so the color was not clear it could have been black or smokey grey.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It came from the southeast and was travelling northwest. because I live near lake Ontario it&#39;s easy to tell direction and it was going more north than west but veering that course. It lasted approximately 2 minuets and speed quessing 70 to 80 miles per hour.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I didnt notice lights because of the sun position near the horizion but it was something I&#39;ve never seen before and the shape also was high more than wide. Guessing again I would say it was about 4 to 5 hundred feet from the ground and in relation was about the size of a kitchen garbage can (the plastic kind). Had police investigate and not sure if they found or saw anything. The last detail I remember is that there was no sound either very quiet.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with this witness, and he sounded to us to be quite serious-minded and credible.

The object was going approx. 15 mph and went behind the trees. I did not see it after that. It was a half circle shaped cream (light tan) colored object.

The more I think about it - the more I begin to think that this was no ordinary light.  Although I did NOT see any disk shaped metallic object, I DID however see a series of unexplainable lights moving around in a repetetive sequence - within the confines of a circular area.  The circular area where these lights were stayed the same, although the lights that were moving within this circular area moved in a repetitive sequence similar to a kaleidescope - only these were white lights - with NO beam as to show where they were coming from.  They seemed to just be in the same spot - made no noise - were the color of white spot ligts used to light up the sky for airplaines, but as I said before - there was NO BEAM to show them as coming from any where from the ground.  They were just in the sky.  I know that we had Northern Lights in the sky earlier that day (this was yesterday) but they would not be moving in such an arranged repetitive formation.  These lights looked as if there were 2 sets of 4 white lights - all equally spaced apart - 4 on the outside of a circle - and 4 on the inside - and 1 stationary light in the center that never moved.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As 1 pair of 4 lights joined eachother at the center, the other set of 4 lights moved apart - eqal distance from eachother - away from the center.  Then they would switch off. Finally ALL 8 lights would shift in a clockwise 45 degree angle and the sequence would start all over again.  1 set of 4 lights moving toward the center as the other set moved away from the center - then the other set would come back to the center as the original set moved back towards the center - then all 8 white orbs about 3 feet in diameter would rotate again about 45 degrees in a clockwise direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It just kept doing the same sequence for about 45 minutes.  In the same circular area.  It was about as high as 2-3 power lines if stacked one on top of another going straight up.  It was the diameter of about a large family home - and it was about 1 city block away from MY house !!  These lights made no noise.  There was no beam of light showing any origination point - as with sky lights used to guide airplanes or lights that might come from a light house.  Nothing like that.  Just up there on their own.  Repeating a type of kaleidescope sequence of repetitive movements - although the center light was the only one that never moved.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The lights looked as if they were coming from the underbelly of some sort of circular shaped craft - although I NEVER saw any actual craft.  Just the lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> But it was very weird - I never saw anything like it before - and then it was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My husband and I came home for a moment and when we came back out again - this time they were gone, so we never saw how they disappeared or if they flew away or just disappeared... but they were out there in the same spot - doing the same thing for about 45 minutes.  It MAY have been a natural phenomenon - but why would a natural phenomenon have lights moving in such a repetetive sequence and stay in the exact same spot the entire time for almost an hour.  If it was some sort of a man made light show - then why was there no beam of light showing a source of origin? It was weird.  10 people saw it.  1 witness was a former marine - with lots of medals of honor.  Not a flakey person.  He was the first to admit that it might actually be a UFO, but that we could not see the craft if the craft was dark - camouflaged against the dark sky.  Only the lights below the craft would be visible.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The more I think about it - as hard to admit as it is - it&#39;s a possible explanation.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The only question with this is - why was the craft not moving for over 45 minutes? It was weird.  Has any one else seen anything similar to this??<n>

Shook the windows and other things, then about three minutes later another one that was not as intense, and sounded like it was further away. It was a clear night without any thunderstorms.

All of a sudden my husband pointed out a boomerang shaped shadow in the western sky moving north to south.  It had an iridesenct glow about it, then it disappeared.  After about 5 minutes, the three of us saw the boomerang shaped object flying but with orange lights.  It was again in teh western sky moving north to south quickly.  An airplane coming from the eastern side movnig west to east, we thought there would be a collision, but all of a sudden teh boomerang shaped craft hovered then disappeared.

I was excited, because I thought it was Jupiter, and I thought &#34;This is cool, planets lined up.&#34; After about 12 minutes, I was distracted by my cat, and when I looked up again it was gone.

The three lights formed an equilateral triangular with two of the lights forming the base and the third light forming the peak.  They were white with a brightness approximately like headlights of an oncoming vehicle.  Based on nearby landmarks (e.g., edge of the lake, Interstate 40, etc.), it appeared that the lights were at least a mile away from our location, but it is impossible to estimate how far away they actually were.  To get an idea of how far apart the lights were from one another, if I had held a ruler with my arm extended toward the lights, I estimate that the distance between each light would have appeared to have been 2-3&#34; apart. The lights did not blink or move while we observed them.  We saw the lights for approximately 15 seconds before they instantly disappeared.  We could still see a few faint stars in that area of the sky but saw nothing at all that could possibly account for the three lights.  Based on these characteristics, we do not believe that the lights were produced from airplanes or helicopters.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I was stopped at that intersection and was looking NNW over the North Point Mall toward the horizon.  On the horizon are two towers, a cell tower to the left and a radio tower just north of it.  I noticed what I thought was a globe on one of the guide wires, similar to the globes that are sometimes placed on high tension wires to prevent them from touching each other during high wind conditions.  I paused because this seemed unusual, but at that point, the traffic light changed and I had to continue driving.  Later upon reflection I realized that the size was completely off, and that the sphere was actually about 3 times the width of the radio tower.  It was approximately 1/2 of the way up the tower and about the same distance from the tower to the east.  The color of the sphere was tarnished bronze, bronze tarnished almost to the point of being brown.  It was motionless while it was under my observation.  I went back later to verify that my perception was correct and the sphere was no longer there.  I am certain that the sphere was not a tethered baloon of some type.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Then it abruptly changed course to northerly not a corner turn, more like a rounded turn and still at high speed then it abruptly stopped.  It was a great distance out from earth as it appeared more like a star moving than any detailed lights or objects.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

First, instinct was that it was a satellite, but never saw one move as fast as this object was travelling, more than twice the speed.  But what really caught our attention was the way it travelled, we were looking south westwardly and the object came in from the north in an arc like tangent.  The object then stops,does a counter clockwies circle[with arms out streched about the size of one&#39;s thumb and index finger would make] then makes a counter clockwise return,pauses slightly then takes right off out of sight.  The object apeared to be white in colour,there was no sound or any other annomillies.  The whole event took a matter of seconds,we were all shocked at what had just happend.<n>

After doing my work at the station I locked up and headed back to the main pumping station. On my way back I witnessed a flash of bright white/blue light all around me (outside...in the truck with me). The light was so bright I stoped the truck right away and had trouble focusing (kind of like the effect when someone takes a picture with the flash on). After rubbing my eyes and regaining my focus in my eyes, I continued on my way. It scared me but after thinking about it, I passed it off as lighting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A few months after that the same thing happened again. Bright flash of light, only I wasn&#39;t in the truck I was walking to the truck. Needless to say it scared me once again. Being the second time, I said something to my co-worker about it. After telling them, they  told me a guy who worked there before me had told them once about a bright flash light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Now the reason for me reporting tonight. Earlier tonight around 0:15AM I was on my way down to the pump station and again I saw the bright flash light.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Yesterday, while reviewing these photos on a much larger computer screen, I noted what I had missed initially, i.e., among the clouds the appearance of a triangle of evenly spaced, round circles which, because of their regularity in spacing and shape could be judged to be non-clouds.  This&#34;formation&#34; of circles is adjacent to two very bright cloud formations which seem much brighter than the surrounding clouds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I note that there are no other reports of sightings from this area during this period, so I am reluctant to conclude that they are actually a &#34;flying triangle,&#34; but it is hard to dismiss this possibility when looking at the photo.<n>

Now , nearly a year later, I felt compelled to read the report again, and discovered that it is no longer the original report that I read. I&#39;m not an conspiracy type of person,and I have searched your site thoroughly for that original entry.The entry that was originally there has been replaced by another narrative.

It was silvery in color and did not move for approximately 2 minutes.I went and called a co-worker. We both watched it hover for maybe another 2-3 minutes. It seemed to be fading in and out. Then it began to move north very slowly and it disappeared behind a building.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Approximately 11:45 AM, I went back to the roof to look for it again, and this time it seemed to be 2 spheres that merged into 1 in front of my eyes! It seemed to hover around the same area as before, then started to move very, very slowly, stopped for 30 seconds, and continued to move east and once again disappeared behind a building.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Once again I went back to the roof, this time about 12:20 PM. I looked around and did not see anything. I was about to leave when I looked straight up in the sky and saw what looked like a stretched oval shape, that reminded me of an airplane wing. It was brownish in color. It moved south at a faster speed, more like an airplane speed,for 15 seconds. It then stopped and hovered for 30 seconds. It did a maneuver of 3 to 4 very tight circles. At the last circle it disappeared behind a building. I watched until it re-emerged in about a minute, it did 1 more circle, only to disappear behind a building once again.From the roof of the building I have seen blimps, balloons,airplanes, helicopters, and jet fighters,(after 911), but have never seen anything move like this! I will be bringing my video camera to work from now on.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I am 38 years old, married and we have a daughter ((deleted)) years old.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Yesterday, the 28th of October 2003 I went for a short holiday with my family to Malshej Ghat. At a resort there.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At about 4 am we were awakened because we had lost electricity and it was very hot inside the hotel room. We opened the balcony door and sat there a while.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Soon my daughter noticed that the valley overlooking the balcony was lit up by a pale white light. It was like a dull white floroscent glow. Soon it faded out and we were confused.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then we noticed that a &#39;star&#39; was moving overhead. It was fast but not as fast as a shootng star. At first we thought it was an aircraft but then realized that aircrafts have blinking/strobe lights. This was a star moving at high speed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then we noticed another big star moving left to right slowly. Again this was hard to believe but then we noticed that as compared to other starts in that area this was the only one moving. Soon this bright star lost its light and faded away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After a lot of thought, discussion and debates I am convinced that this was a sighting of two UFOs.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am an intellegent person with a sound mind and would readily accept if I think I have made a mistake.

Of course i wasn&#39;t, but the physical feeling of a struggle to raise up off the couch was definitely present. As i could only sit  i couldnt stand still have no clue as to why. i noticed the woods behind my house was completely illuminated as if there were flood lights on or a landing light on a helicopter as if it was searching. I know for a fact it wasn&#39;t any rotory aircraft.  I also recall as if i was very cold  and started to develop goosebumps in a big way.  Eventually i was able to force myself to stand up.  Only took me about 5 or 6 minutes to push myself up  and walk over to the double french doors which lead to our sun patio.  as i stood by the window the light  faded with a slight flicker then was gone.  Now im not quite sure how much time has past since this first incident to the 2nd but, it wasnt too long after.  I had made myself  go to sleep in my beedroom.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was awaken by the same erie noise as before except this time its directly out front and above my room windows.  I have 3 windows in my room  2 large windows in the front and one smaller window on the side over top of my garage.  Whatever this light was, shining thru my windows as if to see  or whatever.  I just knew somehow  or for somereason this wasnt right.  I knew enough to stay outa the lights.  i do remember a chilly, cold like heat coming from outside, kinda like a vapor rub type wind. i know it sounds strange but thats the best way to explain it. almost menthol like. i wasnt able to yell  but i was able to move and walk better this time.  So being the wimp that i am  i hid in my closet like a freak and never told anyone about it til now.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I woke up in the morning in my closet to a beautiful day.  Even though for days i havent been able to sleep alone.  This really scared the crap outa me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of the event is approximate.  PD))<n>

The evening was beautifully clear, with every star showing.  I was travelling on Fresno Rd going approximately Northwest towards the West Gate.  In a very desolate area above the tree tops was a Triangular shaped object that blocked out the stars but had 3 lights at each apices with a very intense red light approximately in the center of the craft.  I slowed down to approximately 5 mph to observe this craft, then pulled over to observe.  I noticed on the next hill ahead of me someone else was looking at it as well.  I rolled down my window and listened over the din of the idle of my truck as the craft slowly at a turtles pace glided in an approximately westerly direction.  There was a very low pitched hum which appeared to erratically cycle and coincided occasionally with the pulsing of the lights.  I turned on my radio to KVRE 92.9 FM, the Hot Springs Village Radio Station and there appeared to be no interference.  I then switched over to an AM station and got static and a weird cycling signal in the background.  I found another AM station and again the same wird signal was heard.  By this time the craft had crossed Fresno road behind the other vehicle on top of the hill.  As it had crossed over the red light in the center shot a beam down into the timber for several seconds, then it began to accelerate.  I continued to check my radio and the AM continued to appeared to be jammed while the FM station was not jammed.  By the time I got to west gate, the craft could not be fould to the east or west.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous.  PD))<n>

I was on a very busy street with no place to pull over. As I was waiting in a rather long left turn lane for some reason I felt compelled to look up  and what I saw was what looked like a pair of flying eyes coming almost directly toward me but is was actually to the right of me. I realized I was looking at a flying object that I could not Identifiy.  I was in lot of traffic but none the less I kept looking at it untill it passed on the right. What I called eyes were oval white lights  that were strobeing back and forth from their ends to the center and back again. They were not doing this quite at the same time giving the impression of a nano second where one was not lit. At the outer edge of these lights there were very pale small yellow lights that stayed on. This object was very low and it looked as it was actually moving beneath the tree but it was I think about 300 feet above the trees and it made absolutely no sound. It was moving very very slowly it looked like it was floating . It went by me and I could not see it to many trees I turned arount to follow it but when I got to a clear space and I could see the sky there was nothing there  nothing! I have the feeling this craft might have been kind of a flat horse shoe shape. I will send you a drawing. I called the police department but they had not had ant other reports.

While object seemed a distance away she reported that the fireball, which pulsed in intensity, at perigee was about 1 to 1 1/2 times the size of a full moon disk. The incident lasted about 5 minutes until it went out. The object apparently remained stationary in the sky until going dim.  I checked this site and the only sighting near this one was the Abingdon sighting on 10/22.

And we were just exiting the little store, when this giant glowing gold orb about as big as a Walmart crunched into a ball slid quickly through the sky, silent as anything, like it killed sound for a minute to get away in stealth, but the silence was so thudding, like bass on a radio, you could feel it in your stomach almost. It had little white port-holes (We couldn&#39;t tell what shape, they were so brightly shining.) and they were all across the ship in one big, thick, sideways &#34;Y&#34; shape.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Anyway, the ship wasn&#39;t spinning or rotating, just speeding away. But it was strange, this thing was so bright but didn&#39;t light up the sky one bit.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So then came the second UFO orb, red, and glaring. But this one wasn&#39;t quiet at all. It had the sound of a large, metal bowl, with broken lightbulbs scraping around inside. It was a noise that scratched the inside of our skulls like really gritty sandpaper. And this one was red like lava, with ripples, or two golden bands, one inside the other, all over it. This ship was the same size as the other one, or maybe bigger, and was speeding after it, like it was chasing it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After that ship passed, we waited for the others to come. When they did, they said they hadn&#39;t seen a thing but we all had the same kind of splitting headache which lasted through the next day.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We told a bunch of people, some of the marathon guys believed us, and other people did too, but most of them thought it was just really late and we were seeing things, or that we just saw two large meteors.<n> <n><n> <n><n> But the headache wasn&#39;t the only thing that lasted a while after the sighting, for us guys that saw it. The red UFO left a purple streak of light in our vision that lasted twice as long as the headache.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of the event is approximate.

It moved around, but stayed in the same general area.  Looked like two long slender lights parallel to the ground, like this --.  Viewed object in sky until I fell asleep around 12:30 AM.  This object was quicker and more agile in the air than I can explain.  It would take off real quick in a straight line, then seem to turn 90 degrees, then up and down and left and right.  No blinking lights on this craft either.  Can&#39;t tell how far away it was.  I feel sure there will be more reports than this one about this sighting.

I live out in the country and the only light was from my porch light and a large streetlight that’s on the side of the house. After attempting to see if anything was burned and realizing it was too dark I took a deep break and looked up to see if I could see any stars. (Before I was heavily into computers I was very interested in astronomy so sometimes I just look to see what is out there). It was quite cloudy so I really couldn’t see any so I turned opposite of the house to look see if I could see any peaking between clouds. When I turned I noticed an object that looked green with a glow. As a very skeptical person at first I thought to my self that it was some airplane. Then I realized after further observation that it was not an aircraft and it was like something I remember seeing when I was about 10 years old at my grandparents’ house in Ozark, Alabama. I watched it closely and tried not to blink. After what seemed to be a very long time because I was so full of excitement, but was realistically around 3 to 5 minutes the craft flashed an orange-red color and then disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What I think is the most odd part and a part that actually gets me nervous for some reason, is the fact that I didn’t mention it to my girlfriend when she came home, nor did I even think about it the rest of the night. It wasn’t until this morning when I went to survey the progress my fire had made in the daylight I then remember what had happened. I ran inside and realized my girlfriend had already left for work and I had no one to tell. I then got on the Internet and searched for any information I could find about other sightings in my area and found a few, but none were like what I saw. I eventually found the National UFO Reporting Center’s website and reported my sighting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As a person who was previously into astronomy and who used to wonder about life on other planets, but thought they were too far away to visit here and figured that most cases were hoaxes, I am now a true believer.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Towards the end of October 2003, around 9:30 pm with a clear sky, i saw something which looked like an m flying north at speed. It was dark grey in colour, no lights and no sound not even when it passed almost overhead at around 4000ft at a guess. About a week later i seen another one, around 11:15 pm, cloudy and dry, light winds. This one was flying south but had three arches, this too showing no light or making any sound as it passed overhead. I knew the height was around 4000ft as the aircraft from the local airport turn at 3000ft on to their new headings, and a minute later were going in to cloud which put them at around 4000ft+- This one however was reflecting the glow of the town lights making it stand out against the clouds above it, and was about the size of a 737 and again, traveling at a fast speed which i couldn&#39;t even guess at, except to say it was out of sight in roughly three seconds max, my view being vertical ish an down to the horizon. Since then i have seen another twin arch again in early December around 1:am, clear sky and flying northeast, as before, dark grey, unlit, silent and fast.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

On October 26, 2003 while traveling along highway 97 just south of Stoner, B.C., heading north the couple saw what they first thought was a very large aircraft. The fellow told me it looked like an aircraft that would have been coming in for a landing at an airport with the landing lights on. The light they witnessed was extremely bright and again large in size. The object was to their right and a head of them at this point. Also the object was traveling over top of the trees. They soon figured out that what they were observing was not a normal aircraft at all due to it&#39;s size, brightness and how low it was flying. The witness told me they were traveling at approx: 100 kilometers an hour and they were catching up to this thing. He also mentioned, it was unlikely at the speed he was traveling that they would have slowly crept up closer to it if it had of been a plane.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Still thinking the fellow wondered, could it possibly be a helicopter as it did seem to hover for a spit second or two then started moving once again. Being so low, they did lose sight of it briefly due to the trees blocking their view. Once the witnesses got to a crest of the hill and seeing there was a clearing they spotted the object again. At this point it was just underneath the cloud cover. The witnesses estimated the cloud ceiling to be at approx: 8,000 feet or close. The object, still traveling slowly, flying just below the clouds and basically straight across from them when the light just disappeared, then reappeared shortly there after and then finally vanished. The witness mentioned that the highway had a lot of traffic on it and many others driving would have noticed the object. It was hard not to see it due to the intensity of the light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I will be checking this out Monday morning to see if I can dig anything up on this case.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thank you to both witnesses for their report.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Brian Vike, Director HBCC UFO Research Canadian Toll Free UFO Hotline 1 866 262 1989 - Free call.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Home - Phone/Fax 1 250 845 2189 HBCC UFO Forum Board http://216.147.50.102/HBCC-UFO/index.php email: hbccufo@telus.net Website: http://www3.telus.net/public/wilbur8/hbcc_ufo_research.htm<n>

He lives in an extremely small town about 60 miles from me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;m generally considered a no-nonsense individual.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;ve been on this planet nearly 50 years and while it&#39;s possible I may have seen a ufo in the past, I&#39;m almost always the first person to say, No, that was an airplane, or heavenly body or atmospheric condition or whatever.  Nevertheless, on Sunday, October, 26th, 2003, at approximately 12:30 am while admiring the vividly clear &#39;country&#39; sky, I spotted a brighter-than-usual light off to the s-se not far above the horizon. The intensity caught my eye but then as I tried to figure out what satellite I might be watching, it began to move in a way for which I was not prepared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The movement was vertical. Up... and then down again.  Repeatedly, at about 1 full cycle per second.<n> <n><n> <n><n> While I could not see a &#39;body&#39; attached to the light, if the light had been all there was to the object then the amount of vertical movement was (I roughly calculated) about twenty times the diameter of the light.  Since I had no idea at first how far away it was I was using relative measurements.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In any case, my first impulse was to think my eye was &#39;playing tricks&#39; on me. However, fatigue was not a likely answer since when I&#39;m at home I work as a computer programmer and my most productive hours are from around 11:00 pm to approximately 6:00 am.  In other words, that&#39;s the part of the day when I&#39;m most alert.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Another thing: I had my right eye damaged in an automobile accident 11 years ago, and while this may seem like a hindrance, I consider it an advantage in situations like this because since the car wreck I&#39;ve learned to judge depth differently than most people.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Also, although I program computers for a living now, I spent most of my life as a draftsman and had a great many opportunities to work with trigonometric functions while drawing various layouts for anything from buildings to bridges.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;m no stranger to calculating distances using triangulation. In addition, I&#39;ve had numerous trig and calc classes in both high school and college.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So,  since the object appeared to be stationary relative to latitude and longitude, I thought maybe I could judge its location by how it lined up with a major near-by tree limb as I moved around the yard.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is not a bad technique.  In fact, I judged the light to be 1.5 to 2 miles away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At this point the idea of ufo had not crossed my mind. I thought maybe it was a ground search light from a near-by town.  Problem is, most small towns don&#39;t own search lights of that magnitude. Plus, the sky was very clear  (no clouds) and the air was thin which meant no moisture for light to bounce off.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In retrospect there was another thing that was gnawing away at me and I didn&#39;t realize it at the time:  The thing seemed to be waiting for me to watch it before it started moving.  I know that sounds weird but it sure seems that way now.<n> <n><n> <n><n> To continue...<n> <n><n> <n><n> Just about the time I thought I&#39;d figured out how far away it was, it began to move northward while continuing the vertical movement.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Not all that far away it wasn&#39;t moving very fast.  I&#39;m estimating it leveled out at around 60 mph and by this time I&#39;d estimated it&#39;s relative angle to the ground to be approximately 15 degrees. It was fairly low on the horizon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Within the range of its vertical movement, its average deviation was consistent during this northward movement.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After a minute of so of watching it move toward a point which I would estimate to be about a half mile east of me, I began to get concerned. Unless this thing was a balloon, I should have been hearing some noise. However, there are two problems with this line of thought: 1) A balloon couldn&#39;t bob up and down that quickly and 2) On a clear night like that night, sound travels pretty well.  I could easily hear highway traffic a half mile away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The concern finally got to me and I ran to the front door and yelled to my dad.<n> <n><n> <n><n> By the time he got his shoes on and made it outside, the light had moved behind some trees that line the east side of his property.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I pointed to the area of sky north of the trees where the object should re-appear and wanted him to see this thing with strange flight behavior.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Unfortunately, it never re-appeared and he finally gave up and went back inside.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I know this may be disappointing compared to other reports and I barely consider it worthy of most people&#39;s valuable time just to read it, but I tell it here because I have no logical explanation for what I saw.  It actually happened and it really gave me goose bumps when I realized that what I was looking at might be something from our government&#39;s secret arsenal or perhaps something even more exotic like an extraterrestrial object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> By the time you get my age,  firsts don&#39;t happen as often as they used to but this was definitely a first for me.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

We watched as it flew in a S.E. direction.  The center of the &#34;V&#34; was darker then the night sky, with several &#34;points&#34; outlining it were a light yellow or cream color.  It looked as though these &#34;points&#34; were rotating separately.  It was almost transparent yet metallic looking.

It was sort of a long cowboy hat type shape. On the sides of the bottom of the craft it also had a curved appearance with a smoothness between the curves. A oblong red &#34;S&#34; shape was on the bottom with small white/blue circular lights surrounding the oblong red &#34;S&#34; shape. The color overall was a black or very dark grey color from what I could see at the time of night it was. I just stared up at this object because I was amazed as well as very scared at the same time because I had never saw anything of this kind in my entire life. As I was watching it, it shot up and veered off to the right and was gone. It never made a sound as close to me as it was.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
10/25/03 22:40|Trotwood|OH|Other|2 mins.|MUFON/OHIO FOLLOW-UP INVESTIGATION REPORT:  I spoke with the witness from Trotwood, Ohio (suburb of Dayton).|12/9/03|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/033/S33494.html|76|ndxe200310| ((NUFORC Note:  We express our gratitude to Ms. Donnie Blessing, Section Director, Southern Ohio, for MUFON, for following-up on this case, and for sharing her findings here, and to Mr. Kenny Young, also with MUFON, for his participation in the investigation.  His website is &lt;www.FUSE.NET&gt;, where many interesting cases can be found.  PD<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> I spoke with the witness from Trotwood, Ohio (suburb of Dayton).  Mrs.R.(name on file) related to me her close encounter with a UFO on the evening of October 25th, 2003 around 10:40 P.M.  Mrs. R. was taking her granddaughter, age 3, home. She had been babysitting.  Her daughter lives in a semi-rural area with only an occasional lamp post on the road side. As Mrs. R. approached a 4 way stop which was Union Rd. and Little Richmond Rd., she spotted what looked to be a &#34;glowing red S&#34; just above tree top level. The elongated &#34;letter S&#34; was on its side as opposed to be standing up.  She likened the light of the S to the glow of the coils in a toaster.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As Mrs R. came to the four way stop she then saw that the S seemed to be on the bottom of a stationary object. She described the object as a bell shape at top coming down to be shaped like a hat brim.  The object was as long as a Cessma plane and about as tall as a one story house.  The object was black or dark gray in color.  It hovered about 6-8 feet above the tree tops.  Mrs. R. goes on to state that around the bottom of the object there were small round white/bluish lights that held steady.  The object made no sound. At this point Mrs. R. says she became very frightened fearing for her granddaughter who sat beside her in the car.  Mrs. R. says she became so frightened that she did not know to speed off or stay to watch the object longer.  She said that another vehicle was present at the 4-way stop, remembering that she saw a pair of headlights.  She does not remember what the vehicle did as she concentrated only on the object.  She said that she watched the object for a little over a minute.  Suddenly the object shot straight up and veered off to her right and was gone at a tremendous rate of speed.  At this point Mrs. R. states she also sped off to her daughters house.  Mrs. R. went on to explain that she has no interest in the subject of UFOs.  She has seen pictures of them on TV.  She also stated she had no truoble with her car during the sighting.  She spotted no other aircraft in the area at the time of her sighting.  She called her mother and told her of her experience. She also spoke to coworkers of her event.  Weather condidtions for that night were clear with calm winds and warm temps.<n> <n><n> <n><n> INVESTIGATION: I contacted the Trotwood Police Dept.  They reported that no calls had been place on the date in question of a poosible UFO sighting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> COMMENT: I find Mrs.R. to be a credible witness and truthful in her remarks.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ADDTIONAL NOTES: I spoke with Mrs. R&#39;s mother after our conversation. She confirmed to me that her daughter did indeed call her from her cell phone on the way home after the incident. She sounded frightened and upset.  She described what she had seen to her mother.  Her mother relayed the details of the conversation which matched what her daughter told me. At one point her mother said that her daughter is a very no nonsense type person and if she tells you something you can believe her. She also states that her daughter was a skeptic until she saw the UFO.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Filed 11/30/03  This report was investigated by Donnie Blessing, Southern Ohio Section Director MUFON<n>

There was a field next to the road, and as I was looking out the window A sphere shaped object flew in from what I think was the south at an impossible speed. It stopped above the field a engulfed itself in a blinding white light, which lasted only a split second. It then flew off towards the east at the same speed it had arrived at the field. I was pretty young at the time, and I didn&#39;t want to tell anyone because when I told my step dad he just laughed. Toward the back of the field there was a stand of trees, and that&#39;s all that I can remember. I was terrified, and after I told my step dad, I was also very embarrassed. There is an airport near by, but this thing had no wings, it didn&#39;t make even the slightest sound, it had no visible engines, and it could accelerate, stop on a dime, and then go straight back to the speed that it was had been moving at before it stopped. It was roughly the size of a motorcycle.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.  PD))<n>

I suddenly noticed the stars disappear momentarily which then transferred my vision on to what caused the effect - a completely dark triangular craft with two or three unblinking red lights, very small lights, on the top of it.  I immediately thought it was an airplane as Jefferson County Airport is only 5-6 miles away, but it was *completely* silent.  It was maybe 3 blocks away from me at an altitude of about 500 feet and traveling no more than 60mph or so.  I&#39;d estimate it&#39;s size at about 3 times that of a standard F16 fighter.  It was most definitely not a stealth fighter or a B2  bomber; I&#39;m familiar with military and civilian aircraft and this fit none of the profiles.   Once I was able to track it with my vision I followed it&#39;s path, which was south, and was able to see three dim white lights at each corner of the triangle.  Also at this time, I was able to see the &#34;rear&#34; end of the craft which exhibited 3 or 4 (was hard to tell) circular, amber-colored (or glowing amber, I&#39;m not sure) lights.  (I&#39;ll email drawing)  Finally, as the craft got farther away and was ready to pass out of sight into some low clouds, I heard a single, very short and very faint &#34;whump&#34; sound...almost impossible to hear, it was extremely faint and was the only sound I heard during the entire sighting.  I&#39;d estimate the distance at the time of the sound was about 1/2 mile from my location.  If I&#39;d not been watching the craft at the time I never would have noticed it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> That&#39;s about it, thanks for your time.  Contact me for more info if needed.

No meteors were seen in this duration. Craft was hard to see, as it appeared to be the same color as the night sky, which has a considerable amount of sky glow from the town lights below. There was one light at front, two in rear, but they appeared to be reflections on the tips of the craft from the city lights rather than actual self-luminous lights. They did not blink. Object moved much faster than any commercial or private jet or satellite that usually flies overhead, but slower than meteors. Object appeared out of the east with the 3 lights almost in a straight line, but one light clearly was at the front as it passed by and disappeared in the west. Object was about as big as the space between thumb and finger held one inch apart with hand held at arms length. The object emitted no sound. We did not notice any stars being occulted by the space in between the lights, but it did not travel by any of the brighter stars, either. We disagree on whether it was a large object high or a small object low. From our perspective it passed directly through the constellation Perseus, in the north.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

He had no idea until he got home and I looked at his pictures.  There are 7 pictures he took of the land from up on a mountain.  He is in one of the pictures so his dad must have taken that.  One of the pictures clearly shows 2 thin shaped rod like objects in the sky.  This is not a prank at all.  This happened several years ago and I have looked at the pictures alot and thought you might be interested to see them.  I have the original pictures. There weren&#39;t any others made.  There are no objects in any of the other pictures which were taken consecutively.  Please e-mail if you would like to see them.  I hope this is a reliable place.

Apparently there were a lot of them and they were traveling in groups of 2-3-and 4 then they would not see any for a min. or two.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am just wondering if anyone else has seen anything like this..??What could they be?<n>

I first I thought it was a plane, but as I got closer I began to see more lights that went in a circular shape. The lights were red, blue and yellow. It was really low and I could see the bottom of the saucer shaped object as I got closer. It was too low and to quiet to be a plane. I just watched it because I was too scared to get out or my car to get a better look. Since I was almost home I watched it through the side window of my car and when I got home I jumped out and ran inside completely shaken up!<n>

There is a good deal of road construction in this area so at first I thought they were just work lights.  Then a few mouments later I noticed them again, just after that the hill droped away and I got a full view of the craft. It was a large craft triangular shapped craft it appeard to be 250 to 300 feet on a side and about 30 feet thick. At each point of the bottom of the triangel there was a bank of I think 6 huge white lights ( they reminded of the type used to light up night sporting events ).  On one of the side of the bottom there was also a bank of 4 lights lit up between the lights at the corners.  It appeared as if there was room for 12 of these lights between each corner.  My best guess was the craft was headding south.  Also the whole craft was rotating as well as moving forward.  There was no sound being produced.  It was a moonless night and if the lights had not been on I don&#39;t think anyone would of noticed it.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Above a deserted area but not far from homes.  I was driving along with five other people when, I being the driver was checking what was ahead of me and that&#39;s when I saw a strange object in the sky with a bright orange/yellow light blinking on/off.  That&#39;s when I told the other passangers to check that out and everyone agreed that it wasn&#39;t an airplane or a helicopter.  All the passangers and I have lived in this town for quite some time and we know the difference between most of the airplanes and helicopters because El Paso has an airport, army base, and it&#39;s a border town.  We always have commercial airplanes,army jets, and helicopters in the sky so we already know how they look and sound. But this object was just floating in the sky for about 4-6 minutes in the same place.  The object didn&#39;t move from that exact place in those 4-6 minutes it was just flashing a orange/yellow light on and off.  Then suddenly the object will move forward and backward in a very rapid speed.  We could se it really close because it wasn&#39;t that high in the sky, and we could see the fast speed it moved forward and backward and then staying in the same place again were it was floating the first time.  No commercial airplane, helicopter, or army jet I have seen in this town has moved so fast and be so low.  And I&#39;ve seen all kinds of army jets, some I saw about a month ago because we had a Air Show and was able to see all kinds of jets.  Then after 4-6 minutes this object suddenly moved from the deserted place to a place were there&#39;s more lights were you could find stores,malls, and fast food places.  For what I saw, he was close to a WalMart in east El Paso, just floating in top and flashing the same light again but this time he was floating higher in the sky then the object continued to move further away and I couldn&#39;t see it anymore.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date of the sighting is unknown to us, but we assume it is not in the year 1904, as the witness/student indicates.  We have requested clarification.  PD))<n>

Saw one light high in the sky directly over my house. I thought it could be a satellite until it excellerated and performed a sharp 180 degree u-turn at high speed. That is when I took notice to a group of five lights matching the movement one at a time. The lights seem to chase each other in an erractic dog-fight style manuver as they flew from north to south in direction. The first light would excellerate, turn immediately in the opposite direction and stop. Then the next light would perform the same manuevur and stop in a formation type pattern. I thought the formation looked a lot like the big-dipper. I thought I haven&#39;t seen anything excellerate, make an 180 degree turn and stop. At that point, I ran inside and yelled for the family to come outside and view the UFOs. My wife saw the lights and remarked that they were UFOs, because she couldn&#39;t tell what it was. My daughter (10 yrs old) yelled we are being invaded and she sat down on the ground in fear. Later she asked me if they were trying to tell us something because of the formation they kept returning to. My two young boys just watched and never really said anything about it. I told my friends about it. Later, my cousin told me he saw a news report about a person who saw the same thing, but he was in Las Vegas. That&#39;s an idea of how high up they were.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

At approx 1:30 every few nights we have been seeing an object flying without lights in the sky flying out of the south at a very high velocity. The only lights on the object are the ones from the city below. There is no noise, almost like as if you were to be watching a bunch of balloons fly by at a fast rate of speed. Usually when we aren&#39;t looking for it is when we see it. It is the shape of a rectangle.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

We stopped and watched for around 30-50 minutes and noticed planes go past but this object never moved. It appeared to have 3 strip lights making a triangle and a single light underneath, it was a distance off but I could see this shape. Every so often we noticed what appeared to be like a small beam of light appearing underneath it at a slight angle that but it did not reach the ground just a little underneath the object. The lights flickered red, green and yellow I believe but not like that of any plane (we are near an airport so I know what plane lights look like and the airport is off in a different direction).<n> <n><n> <n><n> After a while it started to move a little, but there was no acceleration or deceleration, it just moved left then right a little and then in a sort of s shape upwards. We watched as it would make this movement now and again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Upon returning home from the park I could still see it from the house and observed it for a long time waiting to see any kind of movement that I could relate to a plane or helicopter. It is important to note that all this time there was no sound other than that of roads nearby and it was very quiet, the event is still on going at this time of writing and am awaiting to see what happens.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I was facing east when I noticed a very bright circular white shape in the sky moving rather quickly from north to south. The object appeared to be about as big as looking at the full moon. Myself and both of the people I was with saw the object for about 10 seconds before it went out of sight behind some buildings. I don&#39;t think the object was a meteor or space debris, it did not have a tail and the brightness was consistent.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Blue, glowing with long tail and moving very fast like it was going to crash. After a few seconds of moving faster toward the ground than anything I have ever seen it disapeared. I am a Mmrried woman with 4 children and I was sitting in my hot tub relaxing after the kids had just gone to bed. My husband was on his way to a friends house and upon returning home he said he saw it too. A number of people called the news but they only reported it as a meteor. IT WAS BLUE... Today my son has informed me that on his way home from school there was a news crew in someones yard and they were looking at some peices of an object that fell from the sky last night and landed in his yard.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Many reports were submitted for this event.  To the best of my knowledge, the event was caused by a meteor.  We have corrected the date above.  PD))<n>

It was red and green - I think the ball was red and the cone behind it green, but it might have been the reverse - I was too astounded and it was too brief and unexpected for me to be sure.  The length of the cone (tail) was probably twice the diameter of the ball.  The whole thing - ball and cone - was about 2/3 the size of the moon.  The ball was about 20% the size of the moon.  There was no sound. It curved slightly downward toward the SE and suddenly disappeared.  Did not fade out - just disappeared as if someone turned off a switch.  It looked like a Christmas tree light going across the sky.  I assume it was a meteor.  I&#39;ve never seen anything like it before.<n>

After approximately 1 second, two lights became 3, a second later 3 lights became 4 lights.  They were not moving, just suspended in the sky.  To get a closer look I stood up from my porch and saw what I thought was a shooting star, the same color as the lights suspended in the sky, come out of the eastern sky towards the suspended lights.  Once the &#34;shooting star&#34; contacted with the suspended lights, all lights went out.  I also heard what seemed like all the dogs in the neighborhood barking, but not barking at anyone in particular.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

These are very small dots of light traveling in various directions, and at different speeds. The average viewable time is approximately 1 1/2 minute.  For the past several evenings I have spotted what appear to be satellites coming from slightly west of North traveling in a straight line toward the South.  As they approach a point about about half way across their transit, they make a turn to the right, and accelerate at a high rate toward the West.  As they start to make the turn, they appear to slow down.  There is no sound or lights, or any clue that they are anything other than mundane satellites. The speed they achieve as they travel to the West is amazing.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I was looking due East and happened to look up just as this object went by. I&#39;m pretty sure that it was a shooting star, but it wasn&#39;t like any shooting star that I&#39;ve ever seen! The object was &#34;W&#34; shaped, with the bottom half of the &#34;W&#34; facing east. The tail was a brilliant orange color, and the &#34;W&#34; was an intense blue-green. It was moving at a high rate of speed, and seemed to dissapate as it neared the ground. The tail was about two inches by hand-held finger length in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have no doubt that it was a meteor burning up in the atmostphere, but it was so low to the ground, and the &#34;W&#34; shape of the blue-green head makes me wonder.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

My son sawed that too and saied &#34;Oh, my ((deleted))&#34;. this all episode taked about 5minutes. The object was green, and there was 5 lights. When the object had left the sky, a man was walking toward us, he asked did we saw that thing in the sky?

Oct. 23, 2003, a deafening explosion was heard in the area, coming from SW of Rt. 1 toward the ocean. The explosion was heard in several communities including nearby Pawcatuck, CT. I called 911 as others did. No one knew what it was including the police. A check of the area revealed nothing. The local news channels were told by someone that it was two jets over Block Island breaking the sound barrier. A check with FAA said no jets were in the area; and, this was way too loud to be caused by jets. It was a an incredibly loud explosion that sent birds fleeing in all directions. As of this time the event remains a mystery (13:00 hrs, 10/23).<n> <n><n> <n><n> I will continue to call various federal offices to see what I can find out. This is too weird to just let it go away.

As we were talking I saw what I thought to be a shooting star in the eastern sky baove the Sierra Madre Mountains.  However when the &#34;shooting star&#34; stopped, made a 90 degree turn, &amp; then dissappeared I pointed to the sky to show my friends where I had seen the weird sight.  Just as they looked, another light started zipping around in the same strange fashion.  At one point we had 4 lights moving at once in weird formations.  One of the objects strobbed its white light as it hung motionless in the sky before taking off again.  It generally looked like very bright shhoting stars, except for the way they moved, and interracted with each other.  (It sounds corny, but it looked like they were just having fun up there) Most of the time there were only two to three objects visable at a time, but there was one breif moment when we counted four objects at the same time.  This went on for 30-45 minutes and only stopped when a haze moved in.  We checked the sky every night afterwards, but never saw these objects again. I am just glad that I had 3 other people with me to see it, as I can hardly believe it myself!  It was very amazing!<n>

It glowed a very bright dark red and stayed absolutely stationery for about 30 minutes. All of a sudden, it moved directly north with a dipping motion, it allso was very easily seen to be revolving as it through off the red dark haze that surrounded it. It picked up speed, still in a dipping arc, and took off like a shot. The spot where it had been had what looked like a star(low altitude!!!!) which diminished over a minute or so. The ship was absolutely breathtaking,beautiful.Next day, we told all in our midst, met with the usual &#39;yeah, sure&#39; till 4pm when a co-worker arrived with a loud &#39;you should have seen what my son and I saw last night!!!!!!!!!!!!&#39;<n>

I pulled over to watch and he pulled off next.  The lights appeared in the night sky and were extremely bright.  They were yellowish, in a straight line formation.  They flashed on and shined for about 45 seconds, then went off and a different one lit up.  There were a total of 4 or more (maybe the first one lit up again?) All were in close proximity to one another. After we stopped to watch we did not see it again so we headed home.  When we arrived home we saw it again as we were unloading the car.  Seemed to be further away.  Same pattern, a row of yellowish lights flashed on, then went off and another row lit up.  All very close together. A total of 4 or 5.  No sounds were heard with either one.  The animals did not react.  A small aircarft flying VERY close to the ground was seen after the first set of lights.  This is unusual because there are seldom aircraft in this area, there is not an airport nearby.

I was about ready to say the same thing . I slowed down to 30mph befor we entered the bend as we fallowed it, the oval stayed, hoovering for 2-3 min. remaining in the same place. at that time it was facing us, it wasn&#39;t till after thoes minuets, it started moving, turning to the sky with, what appeared to be, the front of the oval towards the direction of Pocatello. it then took off, slow at first, then it reached high speed and took off towards Pocatello only taking 1-2 minuets to get from Rockford to Pocatello when it would have took a normal airplane like 15-20 minuest. i&#39;m not sure if that&#39;s how longe it would take but i believe it wouldn&#39;t take 1-2minuets. after we both confirmed what we saw, i knew it was something els.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I am college educated in the|11/8/03|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/032/S32874.html|129|ndxe200310| Iam an insurance salesman born April 9, 1947, age 56. I have lived in Northern Nevada since I was age 16. I am college educated in the medical sciences and have specialized in group medical insurance sales since 1981. I have never reported a sighting before although on two nights several years apart and many years ago I witnessed interesting phenomena that may have had mundane explanations.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had only driven on Highway 375 in southern Nevada one other time previously. A month earlier my wife and I drove down to Mesquite, NV together in daylight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On this night, there was no moon that I noticed. It may have been below the horizon or not have risen yet. I was traveling again from my home in Reno, Nevada to my home in Mesquite, Nevada to meet my wife who was waiting there. The night sky was perfectly clear and the weather pretty warm for this date in October. More stars were in the sky than I  could ever remember, but no moon!  At the time I began witnessing the event I will describe in detail, I was on Highway 375 aproximately 20 miles before reaching Rachel, Nevada. At this time I am not absolutely sure which direction on the compass I was pointing but my guess would be Southwest. In any case, as I would notice later on there was a very bright star or planet high in the night sky almost immediately in line with my direction of travel.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was moving slower than normal because the area is Open Range and cattle are everywhere, sometimes in the center of the highway. Anyway, I was moving about 60 mph and very attentive to road conditions. To my right, near the top of my windshield in the Camry, I was startled by a bright orange colored globe that &#34;appeared&#34; for about 5 seconds. As soon as I came to a dirt road on the same side, I pulled over got out but kept my motor running. In the night shadows I noticed a hillside that grew into a small mountain range about a quarter mile away and ran away from my position in the  direction of light I had seen. I guessed that the object was at least 10 miles away althought I had only the dark mountain range to relate to. It was bright orange, the orange was not pale at all but had a lot of red in it. The shape was like a fat cuban cigar, not long at all.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In a moment, I noticed two very small white lights paired together and moving upward from the horizon under the area I had first spotted the orange object.  Then parted about 500 feet up from the horizon,going in almost horizontal paths 90 degrees away from each ohter.I followed the white light that was moving toward the small mountain range and it turned and headed along the range. In a few seconds a jet began to follow this light closely. Over my car engine which ran pretty quietly, I could hear the jet engine. Also, I saw the flashing lights of the jet and it looked like the jets I have noticed in the air all my life. Also, on this highway I had already noted that a lot of air traffic was evident on my left, very high in the sky but that nothing commercial was on my right, only these strange sights. It was so quiet I even noticed the noise of the commercial jets, as high as they were, earlier after stopping.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After about 10 minutes the jet following the small white light was gone over the far horizon and I was looking for any other white lights when two more orange globes appeared briefly near the horizon that I had seen the white lights rise. They were the same color and shape but they were lower over the horizon than the first orange light. The lights came on in sequence, first the one closer to the mountain range, then when it went out in a few seconds another to its left came on immediately and also stayed on for only about 5 seconds. The lights had a distinct fat oval shape and clear definition. They didn&#39;t grow to oval shapes like a blast would but they simply appeared instantly and disappeared instantly. A few more minutes went by before I decided to continue on to the Little Ale-e-inn bar for a chat with anyone who would listen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I again drove slowly down highway 375 toward that bright star or planet I reached a higher point and to my right noticed a few red and white lights blinking on the horizon. This time the object seemed to be on the ground and could have been a small plan on a runway about 5 or so miles away. I kept on driving but shortly I was forced to stop again!Just to the left of the bright star or planet I noticed another very small white light that could have been a dim star except that it was moving in my direction and to my left at an angle away from the star. That didn&#39;t excite me but within a second or two after following its travel path, it became a bright orange globe, just as bright and exactly like the previous two. In about 5 seconds it disappeared and immediately another appeared just ahead of it. The instant the next light went out a third appeared just ahead of it too! Each light was exactly the same shape, size and coloration.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I pulled my car over as soon as possible and this time I turned my engine off thinking that I may stay stopped a while so I didn&#39;t miss anything. The first thing I noticed was a low humming sound that seemed to emanate from every direction. If I had the engine running I am sure I would have never heard the sound! In my imagination I thought the sound to resemble a high speed electric motor that had become frozen. The second thing I noticed in the direction of the first sightings about 15 or so miles away was a white glow like a large city gives off when you are far away in a very dark area. I thought that it could be Las Vegas lights but that city was at least 150 miles from my position. However Las Vegas is the brightest city anywhere and it was possible.<n> <n><n> <n><n> While at this stop I almost immediately noticed several little white lights, like the head of a pin that seemed to wander aimlessly in the sky on the right side of the highway. Most were pretty high up and a couple so faint i could only see them clearly when I looked at them with peripheral vision. In about 10 minutes I became anxious again to get to the bar and talk to anyone local about my sightings.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I arrived at the bar but the lights were out, nobody home. I drove a little bit farther, past the buildings and trailers untill I got to a wide dirt road. At the road I turned into I parked and got out because i was still curious and wanted to see more. I immediately noticed that the low hum was not there. I also couldn&#39;t see any moving white lights, only stars. About 5-8 miles away, down the dirt road toward area 51 I did spot a lot of vehicle lights that appeared to be on high beams. I had noticed no traffic before this time so I decided to move on in case they were base security.<n>

The lady had phoned to see if anyone else in the area had made a report on the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The lady was on her way back home from Smithers, British Columbia which is about a 45 minute drive from Houston. She had a number of young girls with her as she was bringing them back home from a dance rehearsal which they were attending in Smithers. As she made her way up Hungry Hill, and driving slowly due to the foggy condition and just as the lady was to break out of the fog she noticed a extremely bright white object a head of them and not very high up in the sky. As they motored along the object dropped quickly from the higher altitude to just above the tree tops, still moving towards the west, or in the Smithers direction. (HBCC UFO Note: The witnesses said the white light was so low over the tree tops she thought it was going to hit).<n> <n><n> <n><n> She told me her first thought it was an airplane when it was at the higher altitude, but when it dropped so suddenly she ruled that idea out, still not knowing what it was she was observing. The lady went on to say the object/light was huge. Flat like a dinner plate with something hanging from the bottom of it, there was one single green light on the object on the bottom. She mentioned that they were maybe only a half mile away from the object at it&#39;s closet point to them. The witness also said at one point the object moved in different directions carrying these maneuvers out very rapidly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The lady said she wanted to stop to take a good look due to her driving the car, but all the young kids in the vehicle were very frightend so she kept traveling along slowly and glancing behind her from time to time until the object/light had disappeared from her sight. There was no sound heard coming from the object, she did say they had the radio on, but it was turned off when they spotted the object and the car window rolled down.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thank you to the witness for the report.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Brian Vike, Director HBCC UFO Research Canadian Toll Free UFO Hotline 1 866 262 1989 - Free call.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Home - Phone/Fax 1 250 845 2189 HBCC UFO Forum Board http://216.147.50.102/HBCC-UFO/index.php email: hbccufo@telus.net Website: http://www3.telus.net/public/wilbur8/hbcc_ufo_research.htm<n>

It was out of site within a few seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The objects looked silver in color and we didn&#39;t hear any noise. I could see a raised doom on the larger object with my scope, and it appeared to have some kind of vertical lines on the doomed area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We presume the sighting occurred in the year, 2003.

It was much higher than I&#39;ve ever seen a plane fly, there was no noise or contrail, and it was moving at an incredible rate of speed in a perfectly straight line.  I was able to view it for 5 - 10 seconds and then it was gone.  From where I was, it looked like it flew over the Northwest Arkansas Regional Airport (XNA), so they might have caught it on radar.  I thought maybe it was the ISS, but I don&#39;t know if that&#39;s visible to the naked eye during the day.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
10/22/03 14:00|Murrells Inlet|SC|Disk|About 10 minutes|I SAW LARGE SHINY DISC SHAPED (UFO) FLYING OVER MURRELLS INLET, S.C. WHILE FISHING!|4/14/09|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/069/S69582.html|134|ndxe200310| I SAW LARGE SHINY DISC SHAPED (UFO) FLYING OVER MURRELLS INLET, S.C. WHILE FISHING!<n> <n><n> <n><n> My wife and I were out on our pontoon boat with some friends and we were about an 8th of a mile past the jettys in the Murrells Inlet, S.C around 2:00pm on a Saturday and the sky was clear and sunny.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I saw a hug bright flash-like hit an oject that I saw in the sky, and it was as a flash bulb from a camera. I looked up and saw the sunlight was reflecting off of a large curcular object in the sky.  I thought, what in the world could something so big be in the sky?  I knew it had to be a (UFO).  It was the size of about 100 feet across, and it shined like polished stainless or aluminum.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The distance from where I was on the boat to where it was sitting in the sky was around 300 to 500 ft. above the marsh, and about 3 miles away from where we were fishing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I watched the object level up and move due south real slow until it was almost out of sight.  The object stopped in the sky and then moved back due north and it passed back infront of me and it was almost straight above me.  It moved alittle father north and it took off at a high rate of speed to the north west and I never heard a sound.  The sighting lasted about 10 minutes.  I also saw 2 black helicopters flying with no markings around the same area. I have seen (UFO&#39;s) for over 15 years and I hope we will learn about what we see!  Thank you<n>
10/22/03 14:00|Murrells Inlet|SC|Disk|30 minutes|A Huge Silver Disk was Hovering 300 ft. over our Pontoon 15 minutes while fishing near the jetties in the Atlantic Ocean!|6/2/13|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/097/S97875.html|135|ndxe200310| A Huge Silver Disk was Hovering 300 ft. over our Pontoon 15 minutes while fishing near the jetties in the Atlantic Ocean!<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have sent this information to FAA, and was told to foward what I saw to this site, and to fill this form out for you.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On October 22,2003, my wife and I took some friends with us to go fishing in the Atlantic Ocean.  We Put our Pontoon at the Marina in Murrells Inlet, S.C.  It was a beautiful day. We headed out towards the jettie&#39;s near open water where we anchored the boat to fish.  The only fish we caught that day was blow fish.  When you pull them up out of the water because it was so funny how they would blow up, and we entertained ourselves when we caught them, we would tossed the blow fish to someone else, and the fish would let its air out.  It sound like those gag gifts you sit on sounds like GAS, and we would through them back in the ocean.  We did Not have so good of a fishing day,  But we had a wonderful fall day on the ocean.  We checked out other boats and homes out on the waterway.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then It was around 2:00 PM and we were still trying to catch some fish!  When I had a bright Flash of light hit me at the corner of my left eye, and at first I thought it was a Camera flash, but who would have a camera in broad daylight using a flash when the sun was so bright?  But when I looked up to where the flash came from, it was the Sun bouncing off something, and I turned to my left, and It was ONE &#34;huge silver disk!&#34;  It was just hovering there in the sky,as the sun was shinning on the Disk. It was &amp;quot;Tilted&amp;quot; there straight towards us. The Silver Disk was so low, it could not be more than 300 hundred foot off the water. I could see the swirls on the Silver Disk like it was polished! I told my wife to look up at that Hug Disk the sun bouncing off of. We could not believe how large It was, and we have seen many sightings out over the ocean, but never anything that low. It was Hovering just to the left of our Pontoon boat. With the sun on the disk, It was so bright, it was hard to look at it for long at a time, but yet it j! ust drawed you to look at it. We were in disbelief of such a l! arge Sil ver round disk and it was atleast 20 ft deep. The Silver Disk was to the South of us, and no more than a quarter of a mile from us, and tilted right down toward us in our boat like it was watching us. But there was no sound coming from it, or I would have heard It. I have never seen anything do what this Disk done so close to the water while it sit there tilted up for atleast 10 minutes. It was atleast a Hundred feet wide, if not more, and we did not know what to do. There were no markings, no windows that I could see. But it was only one big bright and shinny &amp;quot;Soild&amp;quot; Hug silver Round Disk. After it sit there for awhile, then It slowly turned up right to a level view, and it moved backwards away from us, but we could still see it. Then it moved back to the front of us like it was like focused on us. Should we leave, because we have heard people talk about being taken by some kind of a ship! Then it moved again, and it turned towards the North to North West, and the! disk vanished! I could not understand what it was doing here, or why this Disk seem to stay right with us. but we have seen a lot Large lights out over the ocean before, that I have in another Description.  We never seen any other planes out there at that time in the sky. It was amazing that it would not have any sound from the size it. I knew that we had seen a real UFO! It was kinda like you had to keep your eyes on it, as if it was trying to tell us something, or watching us. But the more I thought about it, and there was no dought we had a large &amp;quot;Silver Disk&amp;quot;, staying real close and I was concerned! What was it doing out here almost right on top of us, and I wish we knew what these things want, and why was it following us so close out in the ocean in Broad day light? We see most of the sightings at night, because of the lights. There were other boats in the ocean, and we never saw it go near them. It was strange, and alittle worrysome. I just wish we had a ca! mera, so I would have a picture to look at, but I will never f! orget wh at it looked like! I will keep a camera with us from now on! We did not catch any good fish that day, but I Did get Something Big, like I never saw before, It was a UFO Sightng! I am a Christian, and I know our God made the &amp;quot;Heavens &amp; The Earth&amp;quot;, but he also said there will be &amp;quot;Sights &amp; Wonders&amp;quot;, We are told that there are God&#39;s Angels, and the devils angels that are fighting all around us for our Souls! Our Bodies are all Earthly until we are saved by the Grace of God, and he fills us with his Holy Spirit, and that changes our bodies to &amp;quot;Spiritual&amp;quot;, and we have God&#39;s Spirit always in our Heart &amp; in our Soul &amp; it&#39;s like a Arrmor of defense! But unsaved Souls are &amp;quot;Earthly&amp;quot;! God says that No &amp;quot;Earthly&amp;quot; Flesh &amp; Blood shall enter the gates of Heaven. I know God made it all, but we still live in a Sinful world, and the Devil is always out in full force to make those that are not saved his. We are all Sinners, But the difference is ! Trusting in God, and having Faith Always in our Lord. If God be with us, then who can be against us? I am so Blessed to have God on my side, and Pray that others allow him into their hearts, so they will know true unconditional Love!  I will draw something up as close as possible and send it US Mail ASAP! Thanks, God Bless,<n>

The light appeared to be almost stationary and very bright. It was competing with the light of the rising sun and was still very bright. The light &#34;phased&#34; through several colors as I watched. It would appear to be white then red then green then blue, there was no certain order to the light as it changed the more I watched. I would think I was seeing a plane with its running lights but it seemed not to move and was very bright. The thing that made me report what I saw was what happened next. I watched the light for about 2 minutes as described and then in suddenly just winked out. The sky was clear, no clouds to speak of, it did not dim or fade it just vanished. I could see nothing in the sky as the light level increased from the rising sun. One possible explanation may be a meteor viewed head on coming straight on into my field of view.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I&#39;ve never reported here, and this seems a little wierd.  Recently I&#39;ve been watching a particularly bright star, south of Orion.  The reason I noticed it was because it was moving, but only slowly and sparadically.  I was using powerlines the first few nights as a point of reference.  It seems to stay in the same place every night in reference to the stars, but it moves to noticably to be a star.  Tonight I had a few friends tell me about it, and I hadn&#39;t said a thing.  Now they are telling me that there are at least two more like it below it.  The bright one blinks from white to green to red as well.  I&#39;ve noticed it for about a month or so.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We suspect that a &#34;twinkling&#34; star may have been the cause of the sighting.  PD))<n>

The light was approximately 35 degrees to my left and maybe 25 degrees above the horizon (a mesa was to my left which blocked the actual horizon but the light was above the mesa).  The light traveled only a few degrees before suddenly &#39;going out.&#39;  The color appeared to me to be a neutral white and did not vary in brightness.  I did not see any trail behind the light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> From my position the light had the appearance of traveling in a SW direction, assuming it was moving parallel to the ground.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was my opinion at the time, and still is, that I saw a partially memorable shooting star (meteor).  I was impressed enough by the sight to jot down what I saw in a notebook (later that night).  This evening, while perusing the recent additions to the NUFORC sighting reports, I noticed a number of meteor-like sighting reports for the night of 20 October 2003 and was reminded of my own experience of 21 October 2003.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Please note that my stated time is approximate and probably accurate to +/- 5 minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Not in any formation, just randomly.  This last until 2 very strange looking craft, possibly airplanes flew by at a high rate of speed heading south.  I looked at the planes with binoculars.  Each on had 2 green lights and one that flashed red and blue in front.  I could not make out the shape do to darkness. Possibly B-2 bombers that fly out of a base nearby.  Either way I could judge by the distance and size this it was rather large.  My wife saw one of the darting balls of light the night before.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Sharing binoculars with husband, the object turned disk like and had a red circle of lights on top. The red lights pulsated in a circle. My husband saw the light move up and down but by the time I got outside, it was somewhat stationary in the western sky. The movement was not like an airplane. No noise. It was the strangest thing I have ever seen. It seemed to be pulsating with energy. We watched it fade into distance.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It had lights on all three corners, and some on the bottom.  My first thought was a ufo, but then I thought that would be a bit far fetched!  So, I stopped at Kroger on the corner and watched it for a couple of minutes.  It stayed in the same spot, not moving, while I watched.  It had no sound, which I thought was very strange.  All of the planes that fly low over our sub are VERY loud, and it wasn&#39;t shaped like any plane I have seen.  I pulled out of the parking lot to go home and when I turned to look at it again, it was gone.  I spoke with a relative who is in the military, and he said that there are no planes like that.  I have always thought that people who &#34;see&#34; these things are not quite all there, but I KNOW what I saw.  I am not a skittish person, but am a college educated, stable person. It bothers and perplexes me that I don&#39;t know for certain what exactly it is I saw that night.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

At first I thought they were planes heading to the Albany airport but then realized they were part of a very large and slowing moving triangle shaped object. It head from East to West then banked very slowly to the southwest and dropped behind the hills and out of sight. I estimate it about 600 feet or so above the ground. During our sighting another person asked what we were looking at and when I pointed up they panicked and left very quickly. There was quite a distance between the strobes, more so than any aircraft I&#39;ve ever seen. Could not make out any structure between the lights but could tell they were all afixed to the same object as they all moved with each other in one fluid motion.It also had no sound at all. The sky was partly cloudy with stars visible . It was quite interesting but creepy.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I looked up at the cloudless sky and saw an object moving slowing in a semicircle. At first it appeared as a star-like point of light. Then it displayed flashes of brilliante colors of light from red, blue, green, yellow and white. I quickly ran into my house to get the binoculars. When I returned outside I was delighted to see that it was still there. Between a few of the colorful flashes I could see the object better. It looked more oval than round but it was saucer-like being overall orange and some black in color. I viewed it for several, good, long minutes then it vanished.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I told the guild here comes a airplane. He said &#34;that is odd&#34; because we were in the upper part of the Yukon near Mount McDonald and you do not see many airplanes there especially at 3 in the morning. Suddenly the cluster of light stopped dead still in the sky. It appeared to be about 3 miles away. Then it started darting around, up and down, then sideways. Then stopped again. We watched it for about 5 min then it darted around again, then stopped and held steady. Light were red, blue and white. I viewed it through my rifle scope and it was a triangle of 12 lights. Lights where white through the scope and all of equal brightness. As we walked on we could see it for about 30 min. As we walked we entered some willows and lost sight of the object. When we came out it was gone. It was the most unbelievable thing I have ever seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Moved in full view, low in the sky in less than 60 seconds<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was on my front porch smoking and I noticed this long light, like a star that moved fast and kinda sparkled moving south. (coming from behind the house next to mine and moving south) The strangest thing was that it moved into and out of full view in less than 60 seconds and it was really low in the sky. I called my friend who lives one street over in hopes that he was also outside smoking and asked him if he saw it too.  He was not outside at that time so he did not, however he did go out and look and he saw three helicopters moving in from the south and they were circling and literally hovering in an area in the south west about 6 or so miles away. I was still on the phone with him while he was telling me about the helicopters and I hung up and walked (about a block) over to his house and I could see the helicopters myself.  They were too far away to have caused the &#34;light&#34; that I saw.  But they were certainly searching for something.  On the 11:00 news there was a report that there had been many calls into 911 about &#34;bright lights&#34; in the sky and &#34;rattling&#34; of houses.  The reporter stated that it was a meteor shower.  Funny thing is, I&#39;ve never known a meteor shower to happen that low to the ground and especially so low it causes houses to shake.  And exactly what were those three helicopters investigating???<n>

Therefore, my best guess is that the fireball entered the atmosphere from the WNW.  The object tracked like a meteror but I&#39;ve never seen anything this large.  It was trailing smoke and started &#34;breaking up&#34; and just before we lost sight the object glowed orange.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Honestly, it was so huge that I gripped the wheel of the Jeep and told my wife to brace herself for the concussion of the impact.

This area is always the darkest and stars are easy to see.

There was no trail left behind but it moved ultra fast, I thought this could be the rocketship that was launched from kursicstan. Hope this info helpfull.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

When i looked back at him the star seemed to be there but rising upwords towards the sky more and more until eventually it was out of sight in the window. We both ran to the back door and watched it rise more and more then proceed to run in and tell our father which didn&#39;t seem to believe us. We then just brushed it off as possibly a figment of our imagitions. Then a few days later driving home from a basketball game we again saw that same star in the same place. we looked at each other and then watched it rise with in 10 min. of spotting it. i then was talking to a friend the following day and he claimed he saw the same thing that i had described, rather it be a real UFO or just a airplane, all i know is that it freaked us out!!!!<n>

It could have been around 20:40-20:50 PM.  I would place it around the same time as the other sighting though, which was at or around 8:45. I&#39;m not really sure because I was standing around talking for a while before it took place.  The reason I&#39;m filing a report is because I&#39;ve never seen anything like it, and it happened almost at the exact same time.  So we were standing in a very well lit parking lot right under a light poll.  We noticed a huge flash which was like a lightning flash.  When I think about it, it was more white than blue like lightning.  I looked up immediately and saw a small orange/red tail die out almost like a little Roman candle.  I was pretty sure it was a shooting star, but all the other reports have me wondering.  I didn&#39;t hear it, but I was talking.  My friend and the guy I was talking to were like wow did you see the lightning, but I was the only one that saw the tail of whatever it was burning out.  I knew it couldn&#39;t be lightning not just because of the tail but because there wasn&#39;t a cloud in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  The year of the sighting is 2003.  Many other sightings reported from the east coast.  We believe the most likely explanation for the event is a meteor.  PD))<n>

It was stunning.  Probably a meteor or space debris, but I wonder if anyone else in the Greensboro area noticed it. Pretty big for a meteor. Did anyone else see this?<n>

I waited about another 5 minutes to see if i just looked in the wrong place and it was no where in sight. It moved what looked like halfway acrossed the sky but very slowly.There were no sound and I did notice other planes further away that did not look anything like this.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

I had never seen something as large as this or with such a long trailing bright green tail. It may have been falling longer than 10 or 15 seconds, we only viewed it as it appeared through the windshield. It was incredibly beautiful!<n>

It seem to pause for a second, then it started falling at a tremendous rate of speed. It had a firey tale as it fell. It appeared as green flames formed a tale of the back. The tale had an angle. It traveled at a 45 degree angle. It was there then it was gone. We heard no reports of any type of crash in our area. I have reported this incident to NORAD as well.

There was a slight arch trailing behind it and then it suddenly shot straight down over the mountain. There was no trail and tracers, just a glowing arch. This is nothing that I&#39;ve ever seen before. The color was unremarkable and unusual. There was total silence. I thought some kids were on the golf course doing some unusual fire works. It lit up the sky. I talked to a friend of mine about 9:30. I had forgotten about the incident.

I was on my cell phone when it happened and remarked on it to my friend.  When I got home I told my husband about it.  I told him to check the news to see if an airplane went down because it happened right near where Jacksonville International Airport is.  I was about 5 miles south of the airport.  But this was NO plane.  I didn&#39;t think anything else about it until I read on Compuserve news about the sighting in Durham.  I remember looking at my watch when I was walking out of Wal-mart and it was 8:35...so, I figure it was around 8:37-8:39 pm when I saw it.  Again, I do not take these kind of things seriously, but was shocked when I read the Durham account.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Oct. 20, 2003 at approximately 8:45 PM I saw a fireball like object streak across sky in a east to west direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was at my son&#39;s soccer game and right at the end of the game I saw a fireball like object streak across the night sky in a east to southwesterly direction.  It looked like a bottle rocket type firework but bigger like a professional sized firework but it did not explode.  It just streaked across the sky.  I would have completely dismissed it as some type of firework but it had  blue green sparks flying off of it and I read on the internet today that a similar sighting had been reported over Durham NC at approximately the same time,  8:45, and that that object was also reported as &#34;trailing a tail of green streaks.&#34;  My sighting was between 8:45 and 9:00 PM, also in NC, just west of Durham.  The report, which was on &#34;What&#39;s New On Compuserve&#34; also said A Durham County deputy sheriff said his sighting was near interstate 40.  I 40 is right behind the soccer field where we saw this object. I&#39;m not sure how many others there saw it but I heard a few Ooos and Ahhs, after I saw it so I&#39;m assuming others there saw it too.  My mother-in-law saw it.  I&#39;m assuming everybody else that saw it also dismissed it as a possible firework because nobody said anything else about it.  Everyone was too excited that we had just had a very exciting soccer game with my son pulling off a hat trick in the last two minutes of the game.  A hat trick is 3 unanswered goals back to back.  My son&#39;s team won the game 8 to 2 so everyone was so excited about the game that nobody thought anything more about the firework looking object.  But there was just the one object and it didn&#39;t appear to come from the ground.  It was more like it was just streaking across the night sky, but close enough to the ground to look like a firework.  It also made a sound, not very loud, like a firework streaking and I recall hearing a faint &#34;pop&#34; like sound like a firework exploding but it was not very loud.  Neither was the streaking sound.  It was like I was hearing it but like it didn&#39;t sound close.  Even though the object appeard close! The sound sounded like it was far away.  The object itself appeared white hot in the center and when I heard the faint &#34;pop&#34; sound I recall seeing orange as well as the blue green sparks but the orange came from the center white light like it was exploding or breaking apart like an explosion but there was no sound of a loud explosion, just a faint &#34;pop&#34; sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Full 360 deg ridgetop view.  the event &#34;followed&#34; us to Hawaii as well. Will describe three episodes. 1. Looked to the west on very clear summer night, no forecast of clouds.  Clouds as described moved in, ceiling @5Kft. One cloud glowing with something inside, apparently.  Balls of light decended through the clouds, moving down and &#34;playing&#34; with each other in random, beautiful patterns. Immediately looked in vain for ground source (first impression, spotlights playing on clouds) but in country area, little liklyhood of that.  Possible prank or hoax with lazers? But wait. Balls of light left nascent trails behind them. Plasma? and would occsionally pass up and through glowing cloud area to be seen faintly through cloud and dissappear, only to surge back down through the cloud. Also, balls seen in cloud background and night background mostly the same.. Then, above cloud, could be made out spinning &#34;armature&#34; of light, like a great wand (estimate length, at at least one mile) with greater glow at its end. Like the spoke of a wheel only light.  round and round it would go like clock work and the plasma balls  would seem to go up into this phenomenon and come back down.  This went on for some time at least 45 min as we watched the show. Kept trying to think of logical expl. (total skeptic, feel that most UFO either imagination, mistake nat. phenom or primarily secret gov. tech or gov mass hysteria hoax/deception) No ground source.  Balls covering many square miles of air in their dance.  Had the impression at times that the  &#34;wheel of light&#34; was spitting these things out, like a vortex. Almost seemed alive.  Next day (we are not far from Travis A.F.Base) Huge and silent A.F. surveilance planes with bulbous nose, etc. cruising back and forth around area at very low elevation. Have seen phenomenon several times since. One ti! me, wheel of light phenom above cloud quite separate from   &#34;plasma balls&#34; that were streaking very high in atmaoshpere at great speed in definite alignment and purposeful direction, unlike playing balls.  In Hawaii at Waikiki Beach (not kidding) we looked up to see same glowing cloud formation over hotel we were planning to eat dinner at! Not kidding.  Wife says, oh my goodness look. We look up and point,express amazement,(hoping to encourage others to look up) yet the strangest thing. Everyone around us seemed in a daze, totally oblivious to what I thought were our antics , pointing skyward.  This time, the rotating beacon or arm of light was smaller, very low in the sky (cloud was only 500 to 1k ceiling max)and more intense. This time no ball of light, but bundled rods (?) of light emerged from cloud, that&#39;s the best way to describe &#34;it&#34;, moving on a vertical axis and &#34;pulsating&#34;.  Of note, the huge black triangels people report seeing are most likely huge jet assist military dirigibles meant probably for troop transport, cargo lift etc.  There are plans for such triangular mega-dirigables to be seen in Pop Science I beleive. that is why people report &#34;silent&#34;slow movement and hug size. Hope this interests you, it did me.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I said, &#34;What was that?&#34;  He said, &#34;That was a falling star.&#34;  Me: &#34;That was NOT a falling star.  They&#39;re probably shooting at us.&#34;  We laughed and didn&#39;t think anything more of it until I saw the report on the internet about Raleigh.  Sounds like the same thing.  I&#39;ve seen a lot of falling stars and they&#39;ve all been white fireballs.  I&#39;m not convinced of UFOs, but this was definitely not normal.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

This is unusual for October. I took my crocheting out on the back porch to catch some sun since I&#39;ve been in the house all day.  My next door neighbor&#39;s grandson came out into their backyard.  I had just got up to go to the railing to say hi, when a balloon shape in the sky caught my eye.  It looked like a black balloon.  What made me look at it so long was that it looked too big to be so high in the sky.  It was gliding eastward, toward the lake, then it turned and I could see that it was not a balloon but somewhat flat like a disk but not completely flat...and shiny with a kind of orange/gold circular shape in the middle.  Then I thought maybe it&#39;s a frisbee or something...but it kept flipping, over and over.  It wasn&#39;t moving fast, just kind of gliding. Then I lost sight of it as it went overhead and further east.  I ran to the front windows but there are too many trees, so I couldn&#39;t see it anymore.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

My friend asked what that was over my right shoulder just above the tree tops.  The event occurred next to the Memphis Airport, 1/2 mile west and about 3 miles south of us.  I turned and observed a Black round object facing me about 5 miles sse just observed over the tree tops.  We thought it was a large bird circling.  It was not.  As the round portion turned downward, we saw a cross section very thin that made the object appear to disappear.  As it continued to turn or move, the what I call top portion turned toward the sun and was very reflective.  It appeared to be silver, yellowish, and had what looked like a structure or beam across the top red in color.  It was going in a NE direction very slowly and rising slowly.  As it continued a tumbling motion, the top portion fully faced us.  We observed the red beam and the color of the top appeared to be yellowish.  It continued to do a tumbling motion.  We observed what I call the bottom, it was all black and round.  As it went over the airport, appeared to move north.  When it looked like it was almost past the airport, at about 3-4000 FT, a small aircraft moved below it at about 2,000 Ft.  Once that aircraft moved away, the object appeared to go NE and gain altitude slowly.  At no time did we observe noise from this craft, no lights, no string or rope.  We watched it till it got so far we couldn&#39;t see it anymore.  Once we went inside, I called the control tower to see if they have anything or observe anything.  Nothing noted from them.  Note: I work in the aviation industry, am a veteran and had a similar job in the USAF.  Have been a aviation buff for over 30 years.  I know the sound of aircraft, navigation lights, etc as this is a part of my job.  If this was a balloon, it would have to have been a very large one and at least round on the bottom, top, and have a very small cross section.  It would also have to tumble in the wind and go with the wind.  The wind was out of the SW t! o W at 10-15 knots.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I just wish it had stayed longer so I could have gotten a better look, Thanks<n>
10/20/03 13:00|Austin|TX|Teardrop|3 to 5 minutes|Teardrop/triangle silver and shiny object moving at slow steady speed in perfect weather during broad daylight in Austin, TX.|10/31/03|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/032/S32543.html|182|ndxe200310| Teardrop/triangle silver and shiny object moving at slow steady speed in perfect weather during broad daylight in Austin, TX.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A friend and myself were driving to lunch around 1:00 pm in northwest Austin, TX.  As soon as we made a righthand turn onto the frontage road along 183 N., I noticed what appeared to be a teardrop or possibly a triangular silver object that was reflecting sunlight approximately 3000 to 5000 feet (it could have been as low as 1000 feet) above the surface looking to the south/southwest.  My buddy noticed it as well to confirm that I was not seeing a reflection in his side door window.  The sky was perfectly clear, so we were not mistaking a cloud formation, nor were we mistaking this for man made utility infrastruture because it was well above these in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were about 1000 yards from the intersection and my buddy decided to make a u-turn to get on the other side of the expressway to get a better look.  As we were heading towards the u-turn, the object appeared to be heading at a slower speed than usual for any type of aircraft that I know is possible barring a  helicopter.  It was moving steady from south/southeast to north/northwest.  At times, it appeared to be actually hovering.  It also appeared to be vectoring in about a 30 degree slow and steady ascent.  There appeared to be no wing or tail structure of any kind that I could detect.  The skin was smooth with no identifying features (windows, ports, markings, etc).  No propulsion of either propeller or jet type was visible.  There was no sign of a contrail or any kind of exhaust or distortion in the sky from the leading or trailing edges of the object.  Since we were in the car at the time of indentification, we could not determine if any sound was coming from the craft.  I am former military in communications/intelligence with top secret, so I DO know my aircraft recognition.<n> <n><n> <n><n> By the time my buddy made his u-turn and we got to the other side of the expressway on the opposite frontage road, the object was nowhere to be seen in either direction of it&#39;s vector for next 3 to 5 minutes after making the u-turn.  It appeared to had just vanished without a trace.  There were other aircraft (commercial and private) in the nearby vicinity, but these were clearly recognizable as man made aircraft; and did not appear to be evading the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is very interesting, because this sighting is very similar to the sighting in Houston on 10/07/2003.  If I had to guess if this craft was noiseless, then I would say that it was.  A very interesting day for us indeed.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The object has a bright white light that stays on all the time. There are also red and blue lights which are flashing with varying intensities. The object is moving ever so slowly but is moving. This is not a planet or star. It is definitely some type of craft. By our compass the object is southeast of us. It is fairly distant and still appears quite large. The array of lights seem to be ever changing except the white light. We have viewed it with the naked eye and binoculars and neither appears like a normal object. My best description would be that this appears to be a cluster of flashing lights. It is now 2:48 and we have been observing this object since 1:30. It is still rising and appears to be moving south. We will be watching your web site to see if any one else has observed this object. It is following relatively the same path that Mars followed this summer but it ain&#39;t Mars! We withhold our names only because we live in a very rural area where we would definitely be hauled off to the funny farm. We would however discuss this with any other viewers or intelligent beings.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We suspect a &#34;twinkling&#34; star may have been the cause of the sighting.  PD))<n>

When I uploaded the pictures onto my computer, and looked over them, it was then that I realized what was so unique about two of them.  A friend of mine claims they  might possibly be helicopters... but I don&#39;t know, I immediatley thought UFOs, basically, because I -want- to believe it is one.<n> <n><n> <n><n> From what I see, it looks like a pyramid almost; with lights on every corner.  It was about a few months later that I came upon a television program on the Discover Channel (?) about a similarly described UFO in (Bermuda?) I can&#39;t remember.  but it did creep me out a little..  In one photo, it looks as I first described it; in the second, it looks as if I caught it while it was moving, and three little beams of color or almost.. shooting? out of it.

I live downtown Vancouver on the 25th floor facing North East.  The light seemed to be over the airport.  At first I thought it was a plane but after watching it, it was much larger than a plane light and was falling vertically.  I was waiting for some type of explosion but it just disappeared into the horizon, like it fell off the edge of the Earth so to speak.  Weird  I saw this happen at approx. 11:30 PM on October 19/2003.  As it appeared to be over the airport I think it must of been much farther as it seemed to disappear just to the right of  where Mount Baker is in the horizon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thank you to the witness for the report.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Brian Vike, Director HBCC UFO Research Canadian Toll Free UFO Hotline 1 866 262 1989 - Free call.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Home - Phone/Fax 1 250 845 2189 HBCC UFO Forum Board http://216.147.50.102/HBCC-UFO/index.php email: hbccufo@telus.net Website: http://www3.telus.net/public/wilbur8/hbcc_ufo_research.htm<n>

I was sitting at home after the 2nd World Series game, when I was about ready to go to bed I took my glasses off and looked out a window. I saw 3 dull lights like in a line. So I put my glasses back on and I see something like a triangle. To me it was 1/2 of a trapezoid pointing up. The object had red/orange lights. I&#39;m laying on my bed and looking at the object and I begin to notice the lights pulsating. Shortly after that I noticed 2-5 smaller objects speeding around it. They all were orange-reddish. Then eventually the bigger 1/2 trapezoid starting rotating and it shot off. Then a second or so later I saw another object the object with 3 dull lights. I am confused. I have made one daylight observation of an object little less than a year ago, which I think is still posted here. It was a solid cigar shaped dull shiny-silver with a black middle rotating in the center of it. They may have something to do with each other I don&#39;t know.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

As I stared at it for several seconds and pondered of retrieving my telescope, it suddenly got dimmer. I thought, this is what a pulsar or binary might look like, when suddenly the object began moving towards the north becoming dimmer every second until no longer visible.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have seen many jets, major pathways are overhead, I have seen satellites that move across the sky, but I have never seen an object such as this move like it did.

It was a couple of hours before sunset. I was walking my dog in front of Sheffield Elementary School when a light in the sky caught my attention.  As I looked up I saw two bright dots of light over the school.  At first I thought it must be a reflection of the sun on a commerial aircraft but I realized that wasn&#39;t the case as a watched them.  The two lights were moving in a random motion, gently zigzagging in a South West direction.  I believe the objects were quite high but I cound not be certain.  One of the lights stopped almost directly above me and the other light circled around it and came closer to it and stopped.  After a couple of seconds the 2nd light continued cirling around the 1st and headed in the opposite direction, the 1st light then started going in that direction, again both moving in an oscillating motion.  The 2nd light made a big arc and headed South.  The first light approached the 2nd light and again they both stopped for a couple seconds.  They both started heading South towards Montague Center, they moved further apart from each other and from then on kept moving in a straight line and kept getting higher as they went.  By this time I had walked around to the back of the school and I was looking at them from a completely different angle so I know the brightness wasn&#39;t a reflection. As I continued to watch them a commercial jet flew across my field of view.  As I watched them go through a small thin cloud their brightness only dimmed a little, then they went into another cloud and I lost sight of them.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I was on the passenger side of my car, looking out the window.  I noticed a rather metallic looking object in the sky.  It didnt appear to be moving.  It was a little dull looking, but you could still tell it was metallic.  I lost sight of it when we drove by a grove of pine trees.  When the sky was in clear view again, the object was gone.  It wasnt too far off, but it wasnt very close either.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I know it wasnt a reflection from my window.  I know it wasnt a reflection on a cloud.

I had Bushnell 7X50 quick focus  binocular beside my chair which I always have there for the various birds we have in SW Florida and the not infrequent high flying plane. I had just been watching a very high flying jet traveling from NW to SE  and was looking at its con trail and I noticed a very shinny object at about 10-20 degrees north of vertical. It appeared to be very high and traveling very fast. By the time I picked up my binoculars and focused, it was directly over head. It was very reflective and appeared to be hazy or opaque around the edges. I would say it was a combination diamond, oval shape of a bright silver color. Within 4-6 seconds from vertical it had reached approximatly 45 degrees due south and abruptly disapeared. There was no con trail, there was no sound, the 7X50 binoculars did little to increase the size and the speed the object was traveling was very fast. I have observed many planes and satelites and this did not fit either catagory, nor was it swamp gas or a weather balloon.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

When it turned on its side it was totaly flat. I could not tell its distance because the sky was clear and blue and there was no point of reference such as clouds in the sky.

Irwin U.S. Army training facility.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The alleged landing took place approximately one week ago (10/10-11)at the Lake Beverly resort on the western edge of Coyote Dry Lake.  The landing site is actually in a marshy area of the small artesian well fed lake itself near the end of a small unused wooden dock.  The area is completely overgrown with a dense stand of very thick 6&#39; to 8&#39; tall cattail reeds.  Whatever it was caused an area of flattened reeds approx. 20&#39; long x 15&#39; wide in a roughly oval shape.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Standing on the dock it is apparent that the reeds are neatly &#34;laid down&#34; in a very obvious &#34;swirled&#34; clockwise pattern.  There is no stalk breakage and in several locations about the perimeter are large bundles of reeds that looked &#34;blasted&#34; out as if by some great force but still just &#34;laid down&#34;. Numerous cattails have been burst open by the force.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In the bottom of the depression is a small area of browned reeds and what appear to be some randomly spaced depressions although the reeds have settled over these making them very difficult to discern. I did not venture out into the depression due the marshy conditions, but the property owner assured me that he had investigated the &#34;landing gear pad&#34; marks and found them to be equidistant (either 3 or 4 marks) and pushed deep into the soft lake bottom.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The property owner did not actually see what caused the disturbed area but found it the next morning.  He admitted that the appearance of this &#34;landing site&#34; coincides with weeks of nocturnal light sightings in the area.  I plan to return to the site next weekend to take photos, measurements, etc. This really looks weird to say the least.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I thought it was for a ball field but I&#39;d never seen them there before.  As I got closer I realized they were too high up to be attached to the ground but they appeared to be stationary.  I was only a few blocks from home and it was hard to tell if it was moving until I stopped for a stop sign.  It was hovering slowly and very low.  When I reached my driveway and turned my engine off I could hear a low hum.  It was right above my backyard, big black triangle shaped with three lights I watched for a few more minutes as it slowly traveled north.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I was working building a sunroom onto our house and as I looked up to see if the upper frame was level I saw a ufo coming from the north. It was bright, starlike, and it made a loop around the house and hovered above me for about five minutes. I went into the house and got binoculars and looked at it. In the binoculars it seemed to change shape, from a sphere to a elongated figure. My daughter came out of the house and I showed her the ufo. She was surprised to see a bright star in the middle of the day. I gave her the binoculars and she also commented that it was changing shapes. This ufo gradually grew dim and we went into the house to eat lunch. After lunch, I decided to get the video camera out with me in case the ufo returned. I went back to work and as I was coming out of the garage with some wood I had cut, I saw three ufo&#39;s coming from the north. I quickly grabbed the video camera and recorded the ufo&#39;s as they traveled above the house. These ufo&#39;s were bright and closer , and are the ones in the video. They were also spherical in shape, and traveled in unison. I also got another shot of a ufo moving above the tree, but this is shorter. Most of the video I took that day did not turn out. I am hoping that these tapes will be examined by experts to determine more about this .<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I saw what I first thought to be shooting star come slowly into sight, moving quickly from slightly SW to slightly NE. It was visible long enough for me to think &#34;Oh, shooting star, cool....look at it go&#34; and then it slowly vanished. I had enough time to think &#34;That was cool...&#34; when an object came into sight at about the same rate but moving from NW to SE. It immediately struck me that this quite likely could be the same object but with a changed vector of about 45 degrees. It quickly disappeared from view. I sat and contemplated this for a bit and had decided a shooting star could hit the earth&#39;s atmoshphere and change directions when a 3rd object appeared moving from the North to the South but this object appeared to make 4 S curves before disappearing. At this point I checked the time with it being 21:45.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There were no aircraft in the area, nor did I spot any satellites.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I looked up and saw a fireball.  I said &#34;What is that?&#34;  Everyone looked and no one knew what it was.  It came from the northwest and was going to the southeast in a perfectly straight line.  It flew over our heads about 1,000 feet up.  It looked like a big ball of fire.  It was the same exact color as fire.  There was no sound and no shadows. At first I thought it was a hot air baloon, but it was going to fast and we couldn&#39;t see anything other than the fireball.  My fiance thought it was a meteor or asteroid, but there was no contrail and it was not falling.  When it got behind our trees, my fiance and I got up and walked back to the tree line.  We could still see it in the distance.  It had now changed directions and was going south.  I ran inside and grabbed the camcorder.  After a few minutes, I came back inside and got the tripod.  By now, we were not sure how far away it was.  We just left the camcorder alone and sat by the fire talking about how weird this was.  When we watched what we had recorded, it flickered a little - brighter and dimmer.  Then it would fade away to nothing.  It would reapper in about a minute.  Then do the same thing over agin.  Until it finally just disappeared.  I called our local police department, the county police and two neighboring police departments, but they had no reports about anything in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My neighbor was talking to another neighbor (with her daughter there also) about what we had saw and the daughter looked at her mom and said &#34;see I&#39;m not nuts.&#34;  She had seen a fireball about 2 weeks ago outside their living room window.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We can come up with no reasonable explaination as to what it was other than a UFO.  None of us have been able to stop thinking about it and are all always looking up to see if we can see it again.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
10/18/03 21:30|Oakland|CA|Sphere|15 Seconds|Distant bright sphere, cruising...|10/31/03|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/032/S32434.html|209|ndxe200310| Distant bright sphere, cruising...<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was standing outside at a house party in Oakland. I was having a conversation and smoking a cigarette with a friend of mine (tip of the hat to Jeff Rense). While talking, I saw in the sky and clearly noted what, appeared to be a distant orb.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first I thought it was the landing lights or &#39;approach&#39; lights for an airplane, as Oakland and San Francisco are often filled with commercial air traffic. Upon closer inspection though, I noticed that the apparent distance and stable quality - and indeed the color (a pale white-blue that I wouldn&#39;t associate with the operating illumination system of a commercial aircraft) - of the light didn&#39;t appear to be sourced from a plane.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My next assumption was that is was a satellite, due to the uncharacteristically clear and beautiful weather we have been having in the San Francisco Bay Area this year, you can catch one or two satellites a week zooming by in orbit reflecting the light of the sun, if you care to look.<n> <n><n> <n><n> However, this object, although probably most similar in appearance to an orbiting satellite, was of too great a size and brightness to be even the largest of low orbit satellites. This thing would have had to have been huge to produce an illumination of that magnitude at orbital distance.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It&#39;s smooth and extremely regular emission of light, at a very consistent brightness, and it&#39;s dead straight trajectory from roughly West to East - at an apparently level path from my vantage point there on the ground, and almost its ponderous quality of movement quickly disqualified any description of a &#34;shooting star&#34; or meteor that I&#39;ve ever heard.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It had a roughly similar size and slightly diminished brightness compared to the current appearance of the now closely approached planet Mars in the night sky. NOTE: I would like to plainly iterate that this object was indeed NOT the planet Mars itself, to dispel any ideas of mistaken identification.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Perhaps the most notable thing about this light was that after about 15 seconds of very consistent traverse, it slowly, and extremely evenly, faded to black without any apparent change in velocity. I&#39;ve never seen anything like it before...<n> <n><n> <n><n>
10/18/03 21:30|Mukwonago|WI|Fireball|15 minutes|Orange Ball in the West Sky.|10/31/03|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/032/S32534.html|210|ndxe200310| On October 18, 2003 at roughly 9:30 p.m., myself, my fiance and my next door neighbor were having a campfire in my backyard.  Suddenly, my fiance noticed an orange ball in the west sky.  All of us stood up and observed the orange ball come slowly over our heads and slowly fly in the distance.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I first saw it, I thought it was an asteroid and told everyone to get out of the way because it looked like it was heading right to us.  As it got closer, the orange ball got bigger in size.  I gestimate it was about 10 - 20 times the size of my thumb at arms length.  I estimate it was anywhere from 500 - 2,000 feet off the ground and moving about 200 mph.  It was the same color as fire.  All 3 of us heard no sound whatsoever.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When we first saw the ball it was coming straight from the west.  Once it was over us it seemed to curve slightly to the south.  After it went over us, my fiance asked if she should get the camcorder.  I said by the time she got it, it would be gone.  Then it came to a stop in the distance and I told her to go and get the camcorder.  I set the camcorder on the tripod and recorded the orange ball for about 6 minutes.  The ball hovered in the distance for close to ten minutes.  When it was stationary, the ball of light turned off and on twice.  The first time for about 30 seconds and the second for about 5 seconds.  It was a very clear night.  After a few minutes of watching it stationary, it slowly drifted away while the ball was flickering or illuminating in and out.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Last night while driving home from work, I noticed a red (about the color of a stop light only a little darker) spherical, steady light about 40° above the horizon to my left. At first I though it was a tower light but then realzed it was too high. It appeared to be stationary but I wasn&#39;t certain because I was moving at about 50 mph.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Anyway, As I kept glancing at it, I noticed that an elongated, vertical, dark spot kept moving from right to left across the object/light which seemed to indicate that it was rotating. I looked for a road to turn off on but it took a few minutes and by the time I saw the light again, it had moved westward and was closer to the western horizon. Soon thereafter it moved out of sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> NOTES: I am an experienced observer of the night sky and of various types of aircraft and their light displays. This object, whatever it was, had a shade of red that I have never seen on an aircraft. Plus it appeared to be rotating and I saw no white or green flashing anti-collision lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The sky was clear and the object was about three times as large as Mars appears to be. Mars, by the way was in a different part of the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was driving on S.R. #7 in Indiana at the time and the object was just east of Columbus, Indiana in the northern sky. This was DEFINITELY not a twinkling star or a flare.I&#34;ve seen both of those many times.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I was walking west and looking at nothing in particular in the sky when I saw a very small object--it was West-Southwest from me, by my guess--basically just a spot of orangish light in the sky. At first I thought it might be Mars, still visible to the naked eye (I had been following all the Mars news during September and making a point to look for it when outside at night), but then I realized the object seemed to be moving, and the light (roughly the color of fire) was flickering. I pointed it out to my friend, and we started watching it. As we watched over the course of several minutes, the object definitely moved in what appeared to be a southeastern direction, with its light flickering brighter and darker (not radically so, but we could see the difference). After a minute or two of watching, something smaller seemed to fall off the object, casting its own identical light. It appeared to fall straight down, and its light extinguished after just a few seconds. The primary object continued moving southeasterly, and after another minute or two, its light slowly faded to nothing, taking about a minute to do so. By the time it disappeared, it was located South-Southwest from our POV.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
10/18/03 21:00|West Chester|OH|Chevron|About 1 minute|Several strange aircraft, directed light my direction and retreated when spied upon with telescope..|10/31/03|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/032/S32642.html|213|ndxe200310| Several strange aircraft, directed light my direction and retreated when spied upon with telescope..<n> <n><n> <n><n> After seeing this report I decided maybe it&#39;s not an airplane so I am filing the report now.<n> <n><n> <n><n> http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/032/S32206.html  I&#39;ve seen SEVERAL (more than 5) of these.. I thought as well they were too low, too silent and too large but still dismissed them as suspicious aircraft and not UFOs.. However, one week ago (10/18/03) I observed one through my telescope and it looked exactly like the drawing in the image provided in the aformentioned report. One thing eerie about the observation was how it seemed to &#34;react&#34; almost as if the occupants knew I was looking at it. This one was approximately 3 to 4 mi due south traveling at a constant rate of speed until I watched it. Then it became extremely bright (actually lit up me and everything around me in a diffused light similar to what you would get with a partial moon) like it was pointing a huge spot light of sorts. I could no longer observe it through the telescope due to this light and simply watched it for another 30 seconds or so with my naked eye when it &#34;really&#34; surprised me by reversing direction completely and abruptly, shooting away from my location to the south-south-east at a breathtaking speed especially given it&#39;s estimated distance from me. I do truly believe it&#39;s closest distance to be 2 mi from me before it reversed direction and disappeared behind the horizon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> To put in my perspective..  The craft was to my direct south, traveling west-north-west.  Estimating by using some known markers (flashing tower lights) I would think the craft to be almost 3 to 4 miles to my south and moving west and towards me.  With one arm extended, the craft was about the size of an eraser head and approached at probably 1&#34; per 10 seconds.  At it&#39;s closest, the craft was probably 1 to 2 miles from me to my direct south-south-west and approximately 1/2&#34; in size.  When it reversed direction abruptly I do mean abruptly it traveled at probably 3&#34; per second.  When the lights were on it appeared much larger and it truely did seem to be directed at me unless the lights were omni-directional.  The craft took the same route it came, almost like (I know this sounds crazy) but it&#39;s almost like I scared it when I aimed my telescope at it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Anyway, I did want to share this with you to simply make note of it and hopefully give some additional information. As I recall the evening was very cool and visibility was excellent with no haze and very little light pollution. I was simply taking advantage of the atmospheric conditions to look at Mars which is why my telescope was handy.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Some additional information.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I saw the object, I changed to a 1.5x Barlow lens lens and a 20mm eyepiece - I believe that makes a 125x zoom on my scope (which I purchased shortly after my completely life-changing experience before as read in my last report a couple of months ago)  When viewed through the scope, it appeared exactly (from memory) as the picture depicted and was approximately 6&#34; wide, 1/2~1/3&#34; high.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

In the sky were to different lights moving around in the sky. The odd things were that they only appeared in the clouds, not in the sky, and they changed direction. After about twenty minutes another one joined them. My mother and two brothers came out to see them. All three were spining in an oval, and would disapear once they left from the clouds into the sky, then they would reapear once they entered there part of orbit that was in the sky. About twenty minutes later a fourth one joined them. Thats when there orbit changed. It spined counterclockwise in a circle, and after completing a few rotations the lights would cross and end up on then continue spinning. Then as the clouds floated away, we lost visual of them. I called the airport to see if they new anything about it, and they didn&#39;t. I took a picture of them when there were four, I could only see two of them in the picture, then I enhanced it, and I counted seventeen. This whole occurance lasted about an hour<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We suspect the witnesses may have been observing a spinning advertising light.  PD))<n>

The craft illuminated very brightly almost as if it were a reflection.  They did not seem to be burning up in the atmosphere like a re-entry, as they were travelling too slow. There were numerous colors of the reflection/blinking, like green, red and white and each object had a glow to it and you could see each one moving when they were not blinking/shining.  There was no apparent pattern to the shining, but was definately not the blinking of normal single engine plane or jet running lights or headlights.  The objects travelled from a westerly to easterly direction and seemed to vanish behind clouds and did not reappear when the clouds had passed.  There was a small engine plane directly overhead at the same time and was probably landing at Nashua airport around 8:50pm EST.  I could not find the number for the FAA tracking station or the airport tower both located in Nashua to see if they had seen what we did on radar.  The whole thing lasted about one minute, as my wife and I had time to call my In-laws outside to view the last 15-30 seconds when the objects disappeared behind the clouds.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Well, back in October, my friend and I were walking around our highschool at night because there was a dance going on and we were waiting for some friends to come out. We were on an open football field and the sky was very clear, and I looked up and saw two very large crafts flying in the air. The two crafts were very low and seemed to be traveling very fast! I got the attention of my friend and he saw it too, and we were both in shock. I was in denial that what I saw was not an airplane, but I thought (and still think) that it was something else. It appeared as if the two crafts were flying on top of one another. They had green lights, which then became yellow. I honestly could not see the craft very well, so it is hard for me to determine the shape, but I did see that it was very low, and very fast. The thing that really led me to believe that it was not an airplane was because the crafts seemed to be flying RIGHT on top of another, and I know airplanes do not do that at such high speeds. This lasted long enough for my friend and I to talk to about it and he called his brother who actually has said he had seen it aswell, so it was about 3-5 minutes. I am sorry that I cannot give more detail, or be sure on exactly what I saw, but I truley believe that what I saw was not anything normal.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It didnt fly away, it didnt move at all, it just vanished.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

We used binoculars mounted on a tripod and noticed some smaller objects surrounding it.  The object appeared to be a large, white stucture, and our initial thoughts were that it was a weather balloon.  However, the object very clearly split into two distinct objects that slowly diverged to the north and south.  (These could not have been planets or stars, as they quickly faded during the sunset.)  We noticed a Southwest airline 737 flying due west underneath the object at around 7:00 pm, but it&#39;s unlikely the crew spotted the object as it was very, very high above.  We&#39;re very familiar with Venus, Mars, and the usual satellites, and this didn&#39;t resemble any of those at all.  Has anyone else seen this?  (Photos being developed.)<n>

I though it might be an airplane with the sun glinting off it.  Then I saw an actual plane a little further west and it looked exactly like an airplane should.  I turned my attention back to the star object and it seemed to turn sideways.  Once it did that, the light was gone from the object and it looked like a dark ball which had been pinched in on either side, almost a rounded convex shape.  Then it completely disappeared.  It didn&#39;t speed off, but winked out.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

North Bend is a small town, with the main street running only about four or five blocks. It was near the end of the day, not sunset yet, sometime in the late afternoon, when we noticed some dark object in the sky just beyond the town. From the start, we couldn&#39;t make out what it was. I have never seen anything like it. At first, I thought it might be some type of balloon, but I quickly ruled that out. Its shape was going from circular to flat, and it was zigzagging slowly up and north, rather than floating straight up. I could see it quite clearly, although it was pretty far away. After ruling out the balloon, I thought that it was a saucer shape, rotating with one end down at an angle, so that it would get flat and round looking intermittently, just like a garbage can lid does, or any disk shape, when you drop it and it rolls around its perimeter on the ground. We watched the object four about five minutes as it moved higher and north (or more northeast, sort of towards the mountain). I could see it quite clearly for a long time until it got to small and disappeared in the high clouds. I was wishing that I had binoculars when it was lower so that I tell for sure whether or not it was a saucer shape. But I am fairly sure that it was. That&#39;s about it.<n>
10/18/03 17:00|Knoxville|TN|Circle|2 minutes|Large seemingly round object burning up with tail that dissipated towards end of sight, too big to miss,orange tail|10/31/03|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/032/S32480.html|225|ndxe200310| Large seemingly round object burning up with tail that dissipated towards end of sight, too big to miss,orange tail<n> <n><n> <n><n> My wife alerted me to something she saw in the sky to the south, southeast of our home saying  &#34;Honey, What is that thing in the sky?.&#34;  I was working on my truck and didn&#39;t want to get up for nothing because of back problems, but with her insistence I got up and looked toward Maryville, TN;  There was an orange ball falling from the sky with a tail (orange)that was traveling at what must have been an incredible speed.  If you would stretch your arm out and compare the distance between your forefinger and your thumb, it was about an inch long. This object had quite a tail on it for the first 45 seconds or so, then it seemed to dissipate to a certain extent as the object came further towards the ground but the tail flared up in the same orange color on several occasions. At this point I would have to guess its altitude at 2 miles, maybe less. I figured that maybe it was a satellite coming out of orbit, but the funny thing is that it was very close to McGhee-Tyson airport.  I called them and they said they&#39;d seen nothing at seven o&#39;clock, Saturday, October the eighteenth, two thousand and three.  The guy I talked to seemed interested and said he&#39;d call me back. For whatever it&#39;s worth, we saw this very thing and it was cool. I&#39;ve never seen anything like it except in movies or science news. My background is that I&#39;ve always loved the sciences,fairly smart and am happy that I witnessed this falling object that no one seems to know anything about. Thanks. Wish that I&#39;d have gotten my camera but I thought it would be on the news about a satellite going down or a meteorite.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

In the sky, in my line of sight, I saw a bright spherical shapped object which was moving slowly to the SW. The ufo moved from straight above my position to a point about 35 degrees above the SW horizon, where it stopped. It remained stationary for about 30 seconds, then it began to move slowly towards the NW. As this ufo moved back towards my position, I noticed a second ufo of the same shape, size, and color and traveling on the same trajectory as the first ufo. The first ufo was beginning to dim as it moved to the NW. The ufo on the SW course remained bright. The two ufo&#39;s passed each other moving in opposite directions. As I was looking at the second ufo, I lost track of the first one. The second ufo also stopped in the same manner as the first, and then it also proceeded on a NW track. As the second ufo traveled NW, it too began to fade as though it were gaining altitude. I watched this ufo until it finally faded out. Both of these ufo&#39;s traveled on an identical triangular path in the sky,stopping at the same position, and turning to travel in the opposite transverse direction. The movement was very perfect, as though a designated flight pattern had been precalculated.  The entire sighting lasted for about 8 minutes.  Also, both ufo&#39;s had a soft, yet intense white luminescense. And both ufo&#39;s were initially bright, and it was 4:30 in the afternoon, in bright sunlight on a partly cloudy day.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

This lake is located just over the Wisconsin boarder in Michigan’s Upper Peninsula on the Cisco Chain of lakes This event was witnessed by 3 people on the same boat.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The sky was clear with very few clouds and the wind was coming out of the north, blowing south approximately 15-20 mph.  One witness noticed a strange object in the sky, directly overhead and drew the other’s witness attention to it.  The object was heading due north at a very slow rate of speed at best guess at an altitude of 5,000 feet and much to slow for any conventional aircraft. Since the wind was out of the north, the craft had to be propelled by something. However, upon closer observation the craft appeared smooth, silver in color, cigar shaped and had no other visible means of population. We all listened close for noise a conventional craft would make but the craft made no noise what so ever.  The absence of wings or external engines/jets made us really wonder what was propelling this craft. The craft continued on its northerly course at its very slow rate of speed until it disappeared behind a nearby tree line north of us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> All there observers were under no influence of any substance, save coffee. One was a native to the area for years and works in the area in the tourism field. The other two witnesses, visiting from a large metropolitan area, are both professionals in there fields.  This account was submitted with the input and approval of all three witnesses.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I immediatly stopped to see what they were.The crafts were round to teardrop in shape , they glowed or had a shimmer of light to them. That was what caught our eye for the sky was cloudy. We obseverved them swaying , than coming to a complete stop, only for them to race off faster than the eye could see. No sooner had the objects left from our sight an airforce jet, soon raced to the area, that gave us releif in knowing that we we did observe this and it had to show on readar for the jet to arrive so soon. I had reported this on here more than a year ago but it never got posted. I want you to know that this sighting is valid and it has changed my life,after seeing something like this there are always questions left unanswered and I know that my son and I will never forget .<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Iwas driving and looking almost directly west at the time. It was moving slowly from left to right (south to north) in the direction of Alliance Airport. I couldnt see it clearly because it seemed to be shifting somehow. I thought at first it was a small aircraft towing a banner as that would account for the rectangular shape but it was too blocky in appearance to be a banner unless it was either moving tangentially away from me or toward me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The color was a greyish..but it was mottled and also made me think it was a semi transparent banner from a pretty good distance.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The other thing that made me discount the banner was it was moving a good bit too fast to be a banner..they simply dont move that quickly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It wasnt that fast because i could easily get the general movement of the object even though it was vague. For a moment i thought it may have been 2 aircraft in formation but discounted that as well because of the way it moved. i lost site of the object as it appeared to move away or turn with the narrow part of it toward me..i also was going under an overpass and when i came back out on the other side scanning the full horizon lost it all together. This was a very muted image at best..but was very substantial when it first appeared. the size of it when holding thumb and forefinger at arms length would be about an inch. It is altogether impossible for me to say how far it was..but the airport i related it to (Alliance) is approximately 10 miles n-w of where i-d put the image<n>

About a quarter mile in front of me I saw a black and white craft initially I thought it was an airplane as it looked so new and shiny in the bright sun.  I was curious because of its sleek apearance that perhaps it was some new type private jet I just assumed I didn&#39;t see the wings because of the angle I was looking at it from the side.  However I continued to watch it and it turned and continued off to my left as I watched it I thought it was strange that it was so slow moving and to my surprise it came to a stop.  I watched it another minute and it finally took off I even stopped my car in the middle of the road.  After it took off and I tried to continue to track it because of all the trees in the neighborhood I lost sight.  I never saw any wings on this craft.  I drove home immediatly to see if I could see it from my house and so I could show my son but it was gone.  Curiously it was following the path of the American River, flew over the fish hatcheries there and then over lake Nimbus when I lost sight.  Another odd fact..we have a very large company on about 20 acres, Aerojet General who builds and tests rocket engines right along side the fish hatchery.  I was broken hearted when I didn&#39;t see any additional reports on yours nor any other sites.  I&#39;ve never been given to flights of fantasy and it was the middle of the day. I did see it.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The Skies were blue and there were large  clusters of clouds throughout the ski. Visibility was good. The object was probably 2 miles away. It stayed in the clouds darting back and forth and changing shapes. It was dark in color and it would fly back and forth in the cloud. At first we thought it was a Hot air balloon but it moved to quickly for that and changed shapes to much for that. It was to big to be some kind of glider or kite or something. It looked like a 50 yard tarp blowing around in the clouds. I said that it looked like a Dragon flying around.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

PD))<n> <n><n> <n><n> 3 craft on  interstate 80 west took control of my auto<n> <n><n> <n><n> Oh gee, where to start?... Um...  I was on my way to see my sister-in-law in Cleveland OH.  It is about a six to seven hour drive (depending on how you drive) from New York City.  I have made this trip several times alone; in fact, I should have been a trucker with all the miles I place on my vehicles a year.  I had taken a half-day from work so I could sleep and be well rested for the long drive.  I packed a few bottled waters, some Ritz crackers, and a handful of grapes.  I do not drink coffee, I do not smoke, and I do not use those ‘no doze’ pills.  If I am tired, there is always a rest area or the side of the road.  Therefore, I guess I can say I was ready to travel, wide-awake, and not under any influences.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The roads were empty, the main reason I travel at night, and the weather was slightly cloudy.  The last sign I recall seeing was the Chesapeake Watershed indicator- lets you know this area sends its water to VA.  I had very little company trucking wise on 80, they were all moving way to fast for me.  (Should anyone recall my little auto, I pulled into the passing lane to let you all fly by.  Something about lane changes at those speeds in large vehicles frightens me.)  It was uneventful driving.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I would say halfway through PA, the sky cleared.  There were no headlights in my mirrors and no tail lights as far as I could see.  The stars came out.  I have a telescope and star gaze often.  I pulled over on the shoulder between mile markers.  (I am going back shortly and will get the exact mile.)  I was on 80 west.  Using 80 as true west and seated in my auto, the Orion constellation was to the south-southeast declination + 40 to 45 degrees and the moon was left of Orion and almost directly behind me, almost due east.  It was half full, waning, and declination of +30 to35 degrees on horizon almost lining up with the tip of Orion’s extended right arm.  To see Orion I had to turn and look out both driver front and back windows.  The moon was in the farther most corner of the back driver’s side passenger window.  It was so far back in the window that I got out to look up at the sky.  It was clear as glass.  There were no streetlights or houses or the glare form a town to interfere.  I saw some stars I haven’t seen in a while living in the city.  I sat on the boot of my auto for maybe 8 minutes just looking up.  I can say 8 minutes because the song ‘Blue’ was playing and it is just about 8 minutes long.  Ah, size!  The moon was about the size of a racquetball at arm’s distance, it was very bright.  The ground was cast in the silvery blue of moonlight.  Bright enough that when I got back in my auto I drove several miles before I realized my headlights were not on.  Orion seemed to occupy the space of a standard mouse pad at arm’s length.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Well, a Wal-Mart truck screamed by and I heard some roadside gravel hit my auto prompting me to get back in and go.  I gave one last look at the sky and remarked aloud to myself how the three sisters in Orion’s belt seemed brighter than normal.  I shook it off as I could see all the stars for a change and maybe that was it.  Again, it was such a bright moon; I drove without lights for a few miles before a passing FedEx honked me into turning them back on with quickness.  I think I drove for about 30 minutes, there was some light traffic from the trucks, and they passed me and I blinked them back over.  I passed a rest area and had 80 to myself again: no lights in the mirrors or taillights before me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As you can imagine, 80West turns here and there.  Orion moved in my windows almost to the front.  I just needed to glance out my window without turning to see him.  This is where it becomes weird.  I shall endeavor to do my best.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The three sisters in Orion’s belt seemed to grow as I drove.  No, I was not tired.  I have not had the pleasure of highway hypnosis.  I was munching my crackers and trying to sing.  A line of 8 trucks, Wal-Mart, G.O.D, J.B. Hunt, and several municipal waste carriers flew by frightening the life out of me that I pulled off the road on the center shoulder.  It was not enough that I expeditiously moved into the passing lane to get out of the way of these maniacs.  No, they were barreling down in both lanes, blinking, and honking as they passed each other, almost drag racing and advancing on my little blue ’90 Toyota Camry sedan with bright lights blaring.  There was not choice but off the road completely.  I sat there until I was certain they were miles ahead of me.  If I were sleepy, under highway hypnosis, or just lost in my head, I was fully awake and alert now.  I eased back on 80W letting a few fellow travelers pass me.  A pickup from IL that had Truck on it’s tag, a green Lexus, a tow-truck towing a racing team trailer, All Car Racing Team-white, silver, and maroon formula racing car logo on the back ramp.  Then I was alone again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I looked up to Orion out my window and for a moment saw six sisters.  Then suddenly they were three.  I thought my eyes failed to focus, but the three sisters were huge then back to normal size.  I drove on with a mounting feeling that something was just not right.  I kept watching the belt of Orion.  They were getting bigger and brighter and to my horror closer.  Panic started to grip me as I turned another bend.  That is when I realized what might be happening.  God, I’m seeing a UFO.  There were three spheres of bluish white light just of center of Orion’s belt.  If not for the bend in the road, they would have aligned just perfect.  They were just about the size of a dime at arm’s length.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Nah, I am just tired.  I poured one bottle of cold water on my head, just to be certain.  I looked out and they were still there.  I looked with earnest; maybe this was night balloon flight.  I have been on one and it is eerie.  Hot air balloons with lights shining up from the gondola into the balloon giving it an otherworldly glow.  I saw no burners and the shapes were perfectly round.  I stepped a lot harder on the gas.  Every abduction scenario I have ever heard raced through my head.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Not me!  I grabbed my mobile: no signal.  I topped 95 MPH and my car began to shake.  All I wanted to do was get to other people, another traveler, truck even- just not alone.  I had to bring it back down to 80MPH to stop the shaking.  My eyes kept a watch on the three lights.  They seemed to be following me.  I glanced at the radio 2 am.  I looked back out the window and they were gone.  I craned my neck to see out every piece of glass and saw nothing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> WHEW! This was a relief.  They were gone.  I eased of the gas and coasted to about 50MPH.  I opened the last bottle of water and poured it on my head.  I was sitting in a puddle, but it was preferable to ((deleted)) probing.  I eased my poor auto around the next corner and freaked.  All three balls of light were headed straight at me.  Yes, sure I though it was a vehicle in the wrong lane headed straight at me but this highway is split in half by some serious hills and valleys.  You would have to be suicidal to drive the wrong way.  However, they were at the tops of the trees ruling out a truck or car.  I feared for my life.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My steering wheel suddenly started twisting left and right, swerving me all over the road.  I gripped it so tightly trying to keep control, I put a blood blister on my right thumb.  The more I fought the harder it became to control.  It seemed to me that the lights were controlling my auto.  In that clarity that comes in absolute terror, I let my steering wheel go.  They obviously were more powerful than I was and if they had control of my auto, how was I going to get it back?  I resigned myself to ((deleted)) probing and let go of the wheel.  The moment I let go, my car straightened out and the lights surrounded me.  There was one on the front bumper and one on each side.  They guided my auto on 80 for a few minutes, send beams into my auto, attempted communication, and then they shot up into the stars and were gone.  When I looked back at the clock it was saying about 2:15 am.  It seemed much longer.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I got a very good look at their details.  They were perfectly spherical.  They all seemed to be identical.  The one on my door is the one I studied.  It was about 2 meters in diameter, made of a metal, and every millimeter was seamed in an intricate lattice.  It looked as if the latticework were the actual joins that made the sphere.  There was no external openings for the light or any propulsion jets.  It seemed to be bending light around it.  I felt vibrations like an electric shaver pulsing through me.  I saw what looked like the ripples from the hot pavement in the heat of summer pulsing just between it and my car door.  Perhaps it is some sort of energy field that pulled it through the air and now was holding my auto.  Between each sphere and my auto was this ripple, maybe some magnetic field that allowed them to control my auto.  There was no sound, not even my auto.  The engine had stopped.  The timbre of the tires sounded as if I were driving through snow.  The power to my dashboard dimmed, all the lights just barely faded out.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The spheres changed color.  I could not detect the source of the lighting.  They went from the white blue of twinkling stars to a dim silvery blue almost the shade of the moon light on the ground then back to the white blue.  The sphere in front changed to a pale washed out sea foam green.  Then as it an aperture had opened a beam of that same pale green light shot out through my engine to me covering my pelvis.  It felt as if someone had struck me with a bat.  Not so much pain as being forced back into my seat. The sphere on the passenger side shot a beam through the door at the same level in the same green.  It was very short and painless.  When the beam stopped the sphere changed to the sea foam green.  I turned and looked out my window to see the last sphere change to a deep sapphire blue.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I felt a slight bump, like a high speed bump.  That is when I knew what the ripples were.  My auto was somehow in the air from the moment I let go of the wheel.  It was some kind of force/magnetic beam.  As soon as I touched down, the two green spheres changed to a pulsing red and shot up into the sky. The blue sphere was still at my side.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It opened my window.  (I sure as heck was not going to open it.)  I could see the entire sphere.  The intricate lattice seemed to glow in a deep purple.  Below it on the pavement, the air seemed to be buzzing, not rippling like before.  The sphere was about eye level with me as if trying to stare me down.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A bright light blinded me hitting me square in the face.  I could feel its warmth on my skin, feel the same electric razor vibration, and I could not see.  I was paralyzed with fear.  I could not move, scream, speak, think-anything!  Suddenly there was this mechanical voice.  It sounded as if it came from inside my head.  It felt as if it were all around me.  It said, ‘sorry for your loss.  It is our loss as well.’  It was like a machine trying to imitate a sound it never heard before.  It was monstrous and harsh, but is had sincerity in it as well.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I could move.  The light was gone.  I reached out to touch the sphere, but before I could raise my hand, it turned red and shot into the sky.  I stuck my head out the window (I know fatal mistake).  It joined the other two and they blinked out of sight in less than a second.  When I say joined I mean as a group not into one unit.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My auto started.  The lights on my dash came back up.  It said 2:15am.  I was going about 5 MPH.  A truck horn made me stand on the gas and get out of its way.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The next exit was I believe Loch Haven.  I got out and changed into something dry at the rest area.  Several trucks were parked, sleeping.  All my music is somewhat eerie and spooky.  I choose the radio.  I landed on Coast to Coast and there you have it.<n>

At on point what appeared to be a shooting star flew across the sky at a high rate of speed and stopped at or went directly into the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We observe that the sighting is not inconsistent with the sighting of a &#34;twinkling&#34; star.  However, that is just a guess.  PD))<n>

I walked out the west facing door of my home, and in the sky, just north of due west were 4 lights.  They would move in a circle once or twice then move in to the middle and then back out and then around in a circle again. I thought it might be a strobe type light and continued to walk down our walkway with my dog..when something caught my attention and I looked straight up and there was another set of these lights directly above me, doing the same circle dance!  I stood there with my mouth open, because I knew this wasn&#39;t a strobe light.  It was a partly cloudy evening, so the lights seemed to be hazy or diffused, not sharp balls of light.  And there were no columns of light underneath as you would get with strobe type lights for grand openings etc.  I started to feel..a bit unnerved, scared even and ran back into my house.  There was one other thing, a week or so prior to this, my dog had been acting very strangely.  Climbing behind furniture, our sofa, a chair, digging and pretty much wrecking our rec room.  She has never done anything like this before.  She seemed.totally weirded out.  We would lock her in the garage till she calmed down.  Now I wonder if she sensed the presence or proximity of what I saw that night!<n>
10/17/03 23:40|Las Vegas|NV|Triangle|1-2 minutes|Classic "V" shaped formation|7/8/04|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/037/S37835.html|240|ndxe200310| I witnessed classic &#34;V&#34; shaped formation of 5-7 dim, orange-amber like lights, traveling directly in a straight line from east to west. One in the front (lead) and 2-3 lights evenly spaced from one another, down each side. I was smoking a cigarette in the front of my house while watching a bird, for a few seconds, fly towards the east. When I lost sight of the small bird, I was directly facing the eastern horizon. I immediately saw a small patch of red light (similar to a laser pointing pen) piercing through the eastern sky (approx. 3-5 miles away). The patch of red light was at first (5-10 seconds) small in size similar to the front lights of an approaching commercial aircraft at that distance. After about 10 seconds, I was able to make out a perfect &#34;V&#34; shape outline of the craft with 5-7 semi-circles.  I don&#39;t remember the altitude of the lights; my best guess is it was around 2000-3000 feet (?). To make a short story even shorter, the object became larger and larger as it flew closer to where I was standing. It peaked in size about a quarter of a mile away from me (about one-third,maybe one-fourth the size of the belt of Orion). At that point I was able to look directly underneath it. The lights were no longer semi in shape but full, orange-amber in color with a slight white-yellow haze. At that point I could no longer make out the lights original red outline.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Tonight both of those objects are gone and there is another one in the eastern part of the sky that has moved slowly (yet more rapidly than the stars) and has the same description but with slower blinking and a slightly fainter light...  I have seen sattelites before and this does not appear to be one.... They appeared to be large and very very far off... I thought  I might be able to find out about it online (maybe it was an earth launced craft or probe or something) and have found nothing.....<n> <n><n> <n><n> what are these?  stars don&#39;t normally appear one place one night and another far off place the next<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  If the objects did, in fact, move at a rate different from the rest of the stars, they probably are not celestial bodies.

Last fall I was with a friend of mine who works at Goddard Space Center. He and his supervisor were giving a seminar on LIDAR, and how it is used to record meteorological data. They brought with them a trailer that houses the LIDAR, among other equipment.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The next evening my friend invited me to see the trailer. He hooked up an infrared camera located at the rear of the trailer. We were able to observe the density of clouds with the camera that was connected to a black and white monitor inside. The sky was generally clear with a few high cirrus clouds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As my friend was working, I was watching the monitor. I began to see small points of light zip through the field of view. I told him to take a look, but he said I was just seeing things. Only after he happened to see one of these points of light did he believe me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We watched for more points for several minutes on the monitor, and more came into view. Whatever we were seeing was going in a perfectly straight line from upper left to lower right. After we saw several more of these, we came to a concensus that what we were seeing were nothing more than satellites in orbit.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A few moments had passed and we both looked at the monitor, and observed another point of light. However, this one came about halfway into the field of view, paused, and went back into the direction from which it came. My friend and I both looked at each other, kind of nervously laughed, and said to each other, &#34;I did NOT just see that!&#34;  My friend put a tape into the VCR which was connected to the monitor, but unfortunately, it was a time-lapse tape. We watched for another hour or so, and more points of light came into view, but no other point made a retrograde motion like the one mentioned.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Satellites do not retrograde, and while I thought that this might be a bird, I remember that ALL of these objects came from the exact same direction. I would consent to a return e-mail or phone call. I am curious to know whether or not people view images like this on infrared very often or not.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

There were a few lights underneath the craft. It hovered for a few minutes above the trees and follwed the car until about the Opp city Limits, where it moved off and then disappeared. Most people I have told this too say it is a helicopter or airplane. There was no sound, and there aren&#39;t any airplanes around this area that can hover for a few minutes.

What I didn&#39;t realize was that while they were talking to me on the phone, the display of lights were taking place right now. The youngster asked if I would like to talk to her mother, she called for her to come to the telephone and the Mom described what they were observing at the moment.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About an hour before arriving at their home, the family was at the shopping center and mentioned they could see the lights in the sky. Now calling me from their home, they are looking out the window and watching an amazing display of lights high above them in the sky. The 4 lights at equal distance from one another stayed in the same area in the sky, they turned around as if one would be looking at a Ferris wheel. She also noticed aircraft moving close to where the lights were. The witness described the lights as being a neon green in color. She also told me the lights would turn like the hands on a clock, but very quickly, then they would come together in the middle, becoming very bright. Then the lights would move back out again and perform the same maneuvers all over again but moving faster each time. No sound was heard.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thank you to the family for the report.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Brian Vike, Director HBCC UFO Research Canadian Toll Free UFO Hotline 1 866 262 1989 - Free call.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Home - Phone/Fax 1 250 845 2189 HBCC UFO Forum Board http://216.147.50.102/HBCC-UFO/index.php email: hbccufo@telus.net Website: http://www3.telus.net/public/wilbur8/hbcc_ufo_research<n>

It was flying quite low at about 5,000-7,000 feet.  It was a cool night and I had the window open and there was no noticeable sound.  Although the sky had darkened, there was still enough light left to see that there was no vapor trail behind it.  It was definitely a triangle with 2 blinking slivery-blue lights on 2 of the apices and one white light on the front apex.  The 2 other lights blinked in synch with each other.  I am familiar with the usual flight patterns around here.  I also know that the airport in Venice, FL is only for small private plane.  This craft was not coming in for a landing as there is no airport in the direction in which is was heading.  Also there was no airport it could have taken off from that could explain its really low altitude.  I could tell it was black in color from what little light was left in the sky.  This thing must&#39;ve been seen by many others in that area because the intersection was really busy with traffic.  The fact that there was no sound and no vapor trail, its low altitude and relatively slow speed moving from east to west toward the Gulf tells me that this was no ordinary craft.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Last night, while reading in my living room two and a half small disks emerged in front of my eyes as I read. At first, I thought it was just a reflection. Then, I observed the one reflection be repeated into two and then into two and a half, like a type of mitosis or meosis in biology. I continued to read and the clear lenses stayed in front of my eyes. They were less than an inch each. They did not seem to come from anywhere in particular. When I looked at them closely, I could see the movement of cell-type activity. It was very unusual. I sat up further and attempted to permeate the two and a half disks. Then, I backed up again to read and I could see that they were still there. Eventually, after several minutes, they disappeared. They didn&#39;t really travel or move as an entity. The insides; however, were pulsing with cell-type movement. There were silver-grey outlines inside the lens-type spheres.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

If there is a place to upload the graphic on this form, the graphic will accompany the report. Otherwise, please email me at the address provided if you wish to view it and I will email it back to you.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I would like to start this report by welcoming Mr. Davenport back to the &#34;Coast&#34;  program. It has been great hearing him again, and his updates have been missed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I will also preface this report with this general statement: this is not a very dramatic account. It is, I believe, a sighting of non-natural objects in (or outside)our atmosphere, but is only qualified as such by the confluence of observational details, the character of which seems to add up to something unusual or non-natural. I have had one other sighting in the past, which I reported to NUFORC, which shared many of the same characteristics with this one. While relatively uneventful in a comparative sense, I personally feel that this was a sighting of non-natural objects traveling through our atmosphere (or perhaps, outer space) at fantastic speeds. At this stage of the game, however, such a sighting might be viewed as mundane, and it is anyone&#39;s guess as to whether these objects are &#34;ours&#34; or &#34;theirs&#34;. I&#39;ll leave that judgment to you.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Here goes:  I was standing outside in my driveway at approximately 6:40 A.M., facing East. It was still dark, and the pre-dawn sky was crystal clear. Looking up, I could see the half-Moon directly overhead, with Orion positioned W/SW of the Moon, just over my right shoulder. Looking Eastward several degrees past the Moon, I was just stargazing, staring in the area of Procyon and Pollux, when I noticed an object moving in a linear trajectory from N/NW to SE. I briefly focused on one of the nearby stationary stars so that I could be sure that this was indeed a moving object. It had the appearance (size/luminosity) of a dim point of light, not unlike one of the smaller/dimmer stars that I could see that morning. In fact, it looked like just that&amp;#8230;a moving star. The quality of luminosity was consistent and regular, with no flashing, twinkling, flaming, sparking, etc. the object appeared to be very, very high up in the atmosphere at first, but as I watched its traverse across the sky and focused more on its position relative to other bodies in the sky, I became certain that this object was at the very least in near-Earth orbit, if not farther away. As the object moved through and past the Pollux/Castor region of the sky and began to pass the Moon, I began to lose it from direct vision. I attempted to continue tracking the object in my periphery, and was able to hold it for a moment, but lost it in the glare of the Moon (due to the extraordinarily clear sky, the Moon, though only half-lit, was still casting a nice glare). At this point, I was not sure whether the object was beyond the Moon or not. It was not on a trajectory close enough to the Moon to tell whether it would pass in front/behind it. By the time the object reached a position that was past the Moon&amp;#8217;s position in the sky, I had lost sight of it completely. This seemed odd to me, because I thought I would be able to pick it up again as it moved past the glare of the illuminated half-Moon. Nevertheless, I lost track of it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Just as I was about to write the object off as a near-Earth object of some terrestrial construction, I picked up more motion in my left periphery. I was still staring at the place where I had lost track of the 1st object, when I noticed a 2nd object coming in from the N/NW, following an identical trajectory as the 1st object. It had the exact same appearance, size, and luminosity (that of a dim star) as the 1st object, and seemed to be the same distance away, but was moving at roughly twice the speed as the 1st object. It almost appeared to be in pursuit of the 1st object, or moving to catch up to it, at least. This object continued at this pace until it reached the same general position of the 1st object when I had lost sight of it, and I lost track of the 2nd object in the exact same place. As with the 1st object, I focused on the place where I lost sight of it in hopes of picking it back up, but did not.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I began to turn to my left, I thought I caught a streak of light (much like that of a meteorite) in my periphery, moving from the spot where I lost track of the 2 objects and streaking toward SW, but I cannot be sure of it. I assumed this was probably an optical illusion, as I had no direct view of whatever it was. It is, of course, very possible that the streak came from further movement of one of the two objects, but I do not know. I saw nothing more after this.<n> <n><n> <n><n> To give you an idea of the speed of these objects, I offer the following (please understand that I am not informed in the calculation of relative speeds, but I understand that it can be done, and this type of information helps in doing so): v	As the Moon was directly overhead, it appeared somewhat small, and could be completely obscured by holding a nickel over it in my outstretched hand (I have an arm span of 6&amp;#8217;, so approx. 2.5&amp;#8217;-3&amp;#8217; in one hand from my eyes).<n> <n><n> <n><n> v	The 1st object traversed a path in the sky from about the position of the star Capella to the position of Procyon in about 3.5 seconds. At my arm span (6&amp;#8217;), and holding my arms outstretched and pointing my index fingers at each of these positions (like scoring a field goal), the distance between my fingers was about 2-2.5&amp;#8217;.<n> <n><n> <n><n> v	The 2nd object traversed a path starting well before Capella (when I first noticed it) and ending somewhere around the position of Procyon in about 4.5-5 seconds. Estimating the point where I picked up the 2nd object and pointing one finger there and one to Procyon again, the distance between my fingers was about 4-4.5&amp;#8217;.<n> <n><n> <n><n> v	So, the 1st object spanned a length of 2-2.5&amp;#8217; in 3.5 seconds, and 2nd object spanned a length of 4-4.5&amp;#8217; in about 4.5-5 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Again, understand that these are all estimates, as I had to reconstruct positions and times/distances against the star chart after-the-fact, and some of my star references could have been mistaken at the time. Also, I have no good way to estimate the distance of the objects. I am not a mathematician or what you could call a &amp;#8220;trained observer&amp;#8221;, but I have observed airliners flying high in the atmosphere by day and at night, and I have observed traditional near-Earth objects (satellites, etc.) at night with the naked eye, and I am quite certain that these objects were neither of those things. Though not a great judge of distances and measurements, I am also quite certain that these objects were much higher/further out than those common ones just mentioned.<n> <n><n> <n><n> For the above reasons, it is my opinion that the objects seen had to be non-natural objects that were extremely fast and were extremely high up. Due to the consistency and quality of the light emitted, the linear, airplane-like trajectories, and the speeds at which they apparently were traveling, they almost certainly had to be intelligently piloted craft of some design, capable of distances and speeds not possible with known traditional aircraft.<n>

We need someone to watch this nearly hour video to get their opinion. At one point a light turns red in the sky, blurs and then suddenly becomes a silver bar. There is also a purple light that shows up too. The camera also was exhibiting different characteristics while filming - PLEASE CAN SOMEONE GET IN TOUCH WITH US! I have the video here but trying to figure out how to send it to you.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Went from NW to SE:approx. heading-115 deg. (Straight to Restricted Area R-107A, White Sands, N.M.).  Length of travel: with a 12&#34; ruler held at arms length-approx. 6 in.  The first 4&#34; or so was a Blue color with White borders, with the remaining 2&#34; or so a dark orange/red with the orange/red streak breaking up the farther East it went.  The width of the streak was about as wide as a pencil eraser held at arms length.  Speed: VERY FAST. At the end of the visible streak, the object went invisible!  The same exact sighting was seen on the next night 10/17/2003, except the time was 20;26 MDT.  What do you think the odds are for this to happen exactly the same, two nights in a row?  If it happens again this evening, I will let you know.  I have seen many entries into the atmosphere by various different craft, but this is completely unlike anything I have seen before!!<n>
10/16/03 18:46|Easton|PA|Unknown|2 minutes|An object  was seen hovering above a suburban neighborhood.|11/21/10|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/077/S77661.html|260|ndxe200310| An object  was seen hovering above a suburban neighborhood.<n> <n><n> <n><n> While parking my car outside my house (suburban neighborhood), I noticed what I thought at first was a plane flying low overhead.  After parking, I got out and took a look up.  The object was still there, hovering silently.  It didn&#39;t seem to be any aircraft I recognize.  The shape was hard to make out as an amber-colored light was shining presumably right at me.  I&#39;d say it was either a triangle or a chevron, though the front seemed rounded a bit (hence why I have &#34;unknown&#34; selected).  It was perhaps 100 ft. in the air and only around the size of a small plane, though this is also hard to say for sure given that it was past sunset.   Next, I felt a brief feeling of dizziness as the object slowly flew away.  I heard a very faint sound as it did this.   Presumably as a result of the disoriented feeling, I didn&#39;t turn my head much to follow it.  It didn&#39;t matter as it seemed to disappear as it was at the very edge of my field of vision.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After this, the disorienation was gone and I noticed several people on a 2nd floor balcony several houses up the street who seemed to have seen the object also.  It&#39;s hard to definitively state the number of witnesses, as I can&#39;t say who else may have possibly been looking outside from a window, etc.  I never asked the people from a few houses up about it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> (Additional note:  I have checked &#34;I would like to be contacted by an investigator.&#34;  This is not to say that I am demanding such, but I won&#39;t mind answering further questions on it.)<n>

It basically looked like a bright vertical line and at first I thought it was simply an airplane lit by the setting sun.  However, it was moving very slowly and the intensity of the light never changed (even when it went behind a cloud, I could still see it).  I observed it for about 15 minutes as it pass from straight overhead toward the horizon line.  By the time I went back into the house, it was still visible in the west.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Flat and  circular base with a strangely shaped top.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Around 5:34pm Pacific time, when I was leaving my work and I saw a black object in the sky.  At first I thought it was a crow or a hawk flying, but then a couple of minutes later, it was still in the same position.  My office is located in the middle of an industry park, so there are planes that fly by every day.  But the object I saw was not moving and it was all black in color.  The sun was setting to my right hand side, I tried to see if I can determine its shape by the reflection of sunlight reflected from the surface of the strange object, but because it was all black, I could not see any sunlight reflecting on top of the object, therefore I couldn&#39;t see clearly what the top was shaped like.  But I believe I saw the base was somewhat circular and flat, but then the top is a bit strange looking.  The object I saw did not appear to have any wings and tail like the airplanes I normally see in the sky.  I walked away from the office building and toward the bus stop, I waited for the bus to come and the duration was about 6 minutes.  When the bus came I could still see the object in the skey in the same position, so I decided to call my co-worker who was still at work to go outside.  She came back to the phone and told me she also saw a black object in the sky but it was not moving.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

These whitish orange lights hover side to side fairly low to the ground and ocasionally will get really bright and larger in size for small periods of time then they go back to their reg. size and whitish orange color. They hover for such long periods of time at first glance they look like a light off a tower or a star but after longer observation you find that they kind of hover side to side. We thought they might be helicopters, just when you think that they move in a way or get really big and bright. I have no idea what we are seeing but we see them on a reg. basis at least once a week. Helicopters are the only thing that I can come up with but they look really weird.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

PD))<n> <n><n> <n><n> Mostly stationary blinking lights(one set in a formation) seen in rural Alabama sky with two seperate witnesses.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;m 20 years old and I live in a rural area in northwest corner of Covington County Alabama. My home is about 30 minutes west of Ft Rucker which is a military installation that is the top training ground for helicopters in the US.<n> <n><n> <n><n> That information is important because I&#39;m fairly familiar with the racing lights in the sky that often come with living near air force bases that are used heavily for combat training. It&#39;s not odd to go out into the night air and see several flashing lights floating around with the stars.<n> <n><n> <n><n> That being said I&#39;ll begin my account of the last two nights. I stayed up all last night in effort to cram for a biology midterm(I&#39;m a big fan of science, a believe in natural causality and a doubter of the supernatural, but I&#39;m still interested in it I assure you, but as a man of logic it makes perfect sense that there would be other intelligent life in this universe.) I walked outside 4 or 5 times last night in order to take a break and get some air, I noticed in what I think is the eastern sky near Orion, a light that was flashing red/blue at an alarming speed, it didn&#39;t seem to move. I found it curious but I turned my eyes back to the world of Biology and didn&#39;t think twice about it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Tonite I am again up studying calculus and I just made the first of what I&#39;m sure will be multiple trips out into the night, and what I saw moved me to the point that I decided to email you. I looked back to Orion and saw that the light was still there, but to my shock not far above it was another and a ways to the left there was another, much brighter. I then scanned the sky and counted another 9 or 10 scattered in all directions. These lights are in no way familiar to our area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They also were not moving, but all flashing in the same manor.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I called my friend ((name deleted)), who also lives in a secluded area about 10 miles south , and asked him to take a look into the stars. He saw them as well and it startled him just as it had me. He went a step farther and got out a pair of binoculars and found three rows of tiny blinking lights near the big dipper, I followed his lead and found the same thing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;ve seen some strange things in the sky, but I&#39;m going to say that this one takes the cake.<n>
10/15/03 23:30|Delaware|OH|Light|2-3 seconds|Flashing Large lights like intense headlights on the bedroom wall over my bed at night!|12/9/03|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/033/S33471.html|270|ndxe200310| Flashing Large lights like intense headlights on the bedroom wall over my bed at night!<n> <n><n> <n><n> Was not going to report this, but read another account for Hartford, WI which recounted an experience, similar to possibly three or four experiences I have had at nightin the past 18 months.  One of those experiences I reported on an earlier date that occurred last year.  I was awakened from a sound sleep by a blinding light which looked like a full Moon, but didn&#39;t make any sense at the time.  Later, I called a local observatory and found out that my experience happened on a night when the Moon was not full, and that the direction it would have been in made it impossible for what I saw to be the MOON.  Now in the past three months or so I have seen a light flash above my head over the bed on the wall in my bedroom.  There has not been any sound, but I am extremely agitated some nights and find it hard to go to sleep ever since the last experience with the light coming through my venetian blinds.  The first instance with this experience happened here the Summer before last.  I have found praying the Rosary, helps me go to sleep.  I only started doing the Rosary on October 18th this year.  I find that saying it while I am laying in bed helps me go to sleep and the fear factor has diminished due to this practice.  I had not felt compelled to say the Rosary for years and am what some would call a fallen away Catholic.  By coincidence the night I started saying the Rosary a friend gave me one.  The gift came a day or so after a good friend died.  Something neither the giver of the gift or myself were aware of, so the coincidental nature of all this is very strange.  Another event, I have not formally reported occurred last March and involved a huge triangle over the edge of the property where the driveway is situated which curves around to the apartment in which I have lived for close to two years now! I noticed around the time of my experience a pilot of a private jet aircraft saw a similar object in the air about 140 nautical miles SE of Columbus which is located approximately 20 miles S of where I am living.  I was never sure of the date of that occurrence, but have wondered if what he and I saw occurred on the same night.  He saw a huge triangle which is what I saw also!  Appreciate this website since it is helping me to relate and understand that other people are having the same expeiences I am.  It also helps jog my memory about them, since somehow I have a natural tendency to deny or block the stuff from myself!  That kind of bothers me and makes me wonder if there are other suppressed memories that my mind refuses to cull up?<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

The &#34;object&#34; suddenly made an abrubt left turn (north) in front of me and disappeared over the mountain from my view.

Note that the object left heading towards Oxford, Ohio and would have passed Collinsville on the way to Oxford.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ====================================================================================  Subject: UFO SIGHTING LOCATION: Hamilton, OH (Butler County) DATE: October 15, 2003 - 8:45 p.m.<n> <n><n> <n><n> SUMMARY  Stuart L***** (name used with permission in original site) telephoned the Cincinnati UFO Hotline (513-588-4548) to report sighting an unusual object. Within minutes, he was contacted at the phone number he provided (on file) and explained that around 8:45 p.m., he was at his Hamilton, Ohio residence and walking past a window (facing north) when he spotted an unusual object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object, L***** said, was in the sky situated directly over the Hamilton High School in Hamilton, Ohio (Butler County) and was described as a multi-colored &#34;upside down diamond&#34; rotating in place very slow. L***** estimated the object was around 45 degrees above the horizon at a possible elevation of 25,000 feet, about the height of normal airplanes, he said, situated from his perspective &#39;directly over the High School.&#39;  The witness said that there were a few lights on the object, but for the most part, it was &#34;luminous.&#34; The witness described a mutli-colored, &#34;self emanating glow&#34; which the object seemed to radiate, making the shape of the object visible against a dark sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> L***** said the diamond-shaped object had changed color from red, green, blue, to white, and the lights were rotating, not flashing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> He estimated the object was 1/4 mile long but said that, at arms length, the object was as big as his pinky fingernail.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object was visible for an estimated 10-minutes. L***** said he was about to grab a camcorder and the object &#34;took off&#34; at an incredible speed to his left, or west toward the Oxford area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> &#34;This thing just sped away as if going into warp speed,&#34; L***** said. &#34;I couldn&#39;t believe it.&#34;  He described its acceleration as &#39;extreme.&#39;  L***** also said that two military jets had traveled overhead about 20-minutes after the sighting, probably flying from South to north. They were apparently flying high and out of sight, but L***** estimated they were military aircraft due to turbine sound of engines.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Sky conditions were clear at the time with temperatures in the 50s.<n> <n><n> <n><n> COMMENT  On September 24, 2003, a Franklin, Ohio resident contacted Wright Patterson Air Force Base to report sighting a pattern of green flashing lights around 10:30 p.m. near her home at the Heartland Subdivision. Franklin is around 17-miles northeast of Hamilton.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Filed, October 15, 2003 KENNY YOUNG -- UFO Research http://home.fuse.net/ufo<n>
10/15/03 20:30|Knoxville|TN|Light|30 minutes|Bright light attracts 8 planes|10/17/03|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/032/S32253.html|278|ndxe200310| Bright light attracts 8 planes<n> <n><n> <n><n> At approximately 8:30 Wednsday night October 15, 2003 I was setting up my telescope and ccd with my daughter.  She noticed a bright light and asked me what it was.  It was below and to the left of mars(I was looking SE at the time)and shining at the same or slightly brighter magnitude than Mars.  I looked in my software to verify that there was not a star/object that bright in that area.  After I verified in my software(The Sky) that there was nothing of that magnitude other than Mars in that area of sky, I went to set my telescope up to try and photograph the object.  It was at this time that the object disappeared.  We then noticed approaching out of the east some red/blue blinking lights.  As they got closer we could tell that there was 8 planes flying two abreast.  Two continued heading west, two circled around overhead, two went south, and two more went north.  This continued on for about 30 minutes with the planes continuing to fly back and forth, always two side by side.  About 15 minutes after the first planes appeared, helicopters were heard but never seen.  The planes were witnessed by myself, my daughter, and my neighbor(who came out to water his dog); however my daughter and I were the only ones to see the initial light.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

((name deleted)) was looking toward me and talking I was facing north east.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About 3/4 of a mile to 0ne mile and about 1500 feet in the sky a intense white light suddenly appeared it was about 1/4 the size of the moon at that distance. The light was so intense that ((name deleted)) turned around at the same time I was saying “look at that”.The object split into six objects each 1/4 the size of the original. One object moved upward, two flew right, two flew left and one moved straight ahead. The pattern was similar to a five pointed star, with each tip moving away as a ball of light. As the object separated the individual balls changed color and stretched. The color was white, blue and red smeared or streaked as they moved. The upper ball and the two to the left disappear leaving the right two coming toward our location and grouping together about 25 to 50 apart. These two began to slowly blink in a ruby red color, one blink about every 4 or 5 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They flew within about 8 or 9 hundred yards of our location in a arc back toward the mountain(north). ((nameds deleted)) saw this. The center object turned yellow and move toward the lake and disappeared also( we heard a faint jet sound at this point). We stood outside and talked about what we had saw and about two or three minutes latter a shower of sparks fell into the lake area. The shower of sparks was about 1 hundred to 150 feet long and about 8 to 10 feet wide ,it fell to the south east . About 10 minutes latter we heard a large military helicopter .It came over the mountains to the south very low to the terrain, it flew to the location of the thing that fell made a turn over the location then flew toward Kernville. ((name deleted)) and I went down to the lake to see if we could see anything .There was an odor of hot metal in the air. There was a truck near the location where we estimated the object to be. The truck was moving side to side and around in circles someone was walking in front of it. We decided to try to ask them if they had seen the object but the truck sped off.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((FOLLOW-UP COMMUNICATION FROM WITNESS))<n> <n><n> <n><n> The data box should have instructions &#34; not to include personal data except first names&#34;. The reason that mine was included is I first wrote the report on correl then copied it to the spot.Also, to bad someone could not come up to investigate as stuff from the yellow object fell to the ground or in the lake near the shore(alot of stuff).There was one other vehicle looking in the area for it, as my son and I were.If the lake continues to get lower it may become visible.<n> <n><n> What should we do if we find something?There also was a military hummer with 5 or 6 tubes on top of it in town sunday.I am familiar with jets and stars and planets and the station ,it flew over this location several months ago.I own a telescope celestron 8 inch so I know about those things.And I fly radio control aircraft and have about 50 hrs. flight traing in fixed wing full size aircraft.I have studied military aircraft and the space program for 40 years and if it was ours we are way ahead of anyone else.The single object split into 6 no sound from the two that past overhead.

While loading my truck with wood I remembered hearing a report about the northern lights and that they were suppose to be bright this evening. So I looked up at the sky and I directly saw not the northern lights but this craft flying slowly above me. It was saucer or disk shape with the sides cut off blunt, if I hadn&#39;t looked right at it I wouldn&#39;t have seen it. It was dark in color almost like an eclipsed moon in color but darker. It was about 500 Ft. above me and moving very slowly from east to west, and down river towards the bay. I yelled at my wife to look, &#34;look&#34; and I pointed at what I saw and asked if she could see it. But she couldn&#39;t it was to dark in color and it was night and the craft made no sound. It was something you would have to look directly at to see. The craft was small about the size of a small bus. It took about 10-15! sec to pass over head and continued on its path west until I couldn&#39;t see it any longer which was&#39;t very long.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Considering the fact it was so hard to see and made no sound and moved so slowly I felt as if I was being spied upon or being observed, and I wasn&#39;t suppose to see it.  But I did, and what ever or who&#39;s ever craft it is, made in America or Alien they are out there.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date is approximate.  PD))<n>
10/15/03 20:00|North Little Rock|AR|Changing|5 min|Huge object spotted over Batesville Pike road in North Little Rock Arkansas|10/30/06|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/052/S52220.html|281|ndxe200310| Huge object spotted over Batesville Pike road in North Little Rock Arkansas<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was a clear October night in North Little Rock Arkansas. It was between 8:00PM and 11:00PM my wife and I where taking a drive to catch some fresh air. As we made our way down Batesville Pike road we noticed a strange object approaching us very quickly. There was a car in front of us that must have seen the same strange object as they pulled off to the shoulder about a car length ahead of us. My wife and I where just shocked and could not identify what was before our eyes. This thing (larger than a 747 from wing tip to wing tip) hovered about 20 or 30 feet above the ground right around some tree tops. There where multiple (best guess 20) bright white lights along the front of this thing. The object then moved quickly across the road and hovered over a thick wooded area before the object changed shape and seemed to land or disappear into the woods below. My wife and I drove off trying to digest what we had just seen. We drove about a mile down the road and decided to turn around and go investigate. When we returned to the spot nothing was out of the ordinary. My first instinct was to walk through the woods and see if I could find anything, but after having flash backs of (Fire in the sky) I decided against that. Now with that said I&#39;ll tell you that North Little Rock Airport is less than 5 miles from the spot of the sighting. It&#39;s a small airport with only one runway but what we seen was not using the airport. I also wonder if what we seen was some sort of secret military project based on the fact that there&#39;s a military base less than 3 miles from the spot of the sighting. When the object changed shapes and landed in the woods it landed on military owned property. So it could be one of the two 1) A secret military project or 2) A UFO<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

Around 7:25 PM as we were aproaching Oxford on route 73 I saw a very bright light to the right of a radio tower to our north. I thought to myself &#34;I bet someone might think that light to be a UFO, but I bet it&#39;s some plane&#39;s landing lights.&#34; It remained fairly stationary, which I thought odd. About 5 minutes later the lights faded and the seperation of the object and the radio tower (about 5 miles away) got smaller and the lights got much dimmer. The object was so far away that all I could see was the brightness of the light - I looked for blinking wing lights, but the bright light overpowered them (if it was an airplane). This occured about 1/2 of the way between Collinsville and Oxford. I didn&#39;t have any binocculars with me to get a decent view of the object. At home when I have seen landing lights as bright as the light I saw on 10/15, I can easily see two landing lights close together without binoculars. I am reporting this because I saw there was a report of a UFO in Trenton, Ohio 2 days before and on another site a UFO was seen in nearby Middletown, Ohio on 10/15.<n> <n><n> <n><n> (If you have a copy of DeLorme&#39;s Ohio Atlas &amp; Gazetteer, this took place near the bottom of page 64 along highway 73 just outside of Collinsville heading west towards Oxford, Ohio, before and after highway 177 crosses highway 73. The radio tower is about 5 miles north - near the intersection of Camden-Darrtown Rd. and Camden-College Corner Rd.)<n>

I (dad) came home from work and they were shaking and crying. visibly upset. i believe they saw something unexplained. i teased the twins because it was their birthday, i told them their REAL parents just stopped by to wish them a happy birthday! my kids are not into drugs or anything like that. and they wouldn&#39;t make this up and react the way they did. i ask them is it spun, they said no. i ak them if there was wind or noise. they said no wind but a whirring type noise.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It had a orange glow-possible reflection from the sun.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I came fome from work and I was talking to my husband in out kitchen.  My daughter was out on out back deck and walked in the livingroom frightend.  She said she had just saw something that scared her and was really wierd.  She said come outside quick.  She pointed toward the eastern sky and said it stayed in one spot and then went south and stoppe and went back north, when we saw it, my son and I it was back in the northeast sky. It was a slim cigar shaped silver metal object (like a plane with no wings).  It had a orange glow-possible reflection from setting sun.  It seemed to be about 15000 to 20000 miles up.  No flashing lights and slowly moving south.  My son and I tried to follow it by going into the back yard and it went behind some trees, when we waited for it too emerge like an airplane would on a direct path, it never showed up where I thought it would.  It dissapered from our sight.  I did not witness the going back and forth like my daughter did but when I first caught sight of it was at the starting point that she saw it, I don&#39;t believe a plane can do that. I didn&#39;t think too much about it until this morning and my husband told me that last night around 3:00 am he was outside smoking a cigarette and he was star watching.  He was looking toward the east and thought he saw a shooting star and looked back toward the west and the whole sky lit up like lightning, but there were no clouds in sight, turned back around and in the eastern sky said there was a z shaped trail of smoke that was kinda orange and white in color.  Looked back west and never saw another flash.  This may be all explained and it would make me and my daughter feel better if someone could.  Anybody?<n>
10/15/03 18:00|Westerville|OH|Unknown|40 minutes|UFO over Westerville, Ohio?|5/24/05|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/043/S43593.html|285|ndxe200310| UFO over Westerville, Ohio?<n> <n><n> <n><n> My wife and I were sitting on our screened-in porch at our home in Westerville, Ohio, which faces east.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At around 6:00 pm on an October evening, we saw a large bright stationary object in the southeast sky.  I tended to ignore it for awhile.  I thought that perhaps it was a communications satellite.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I went into the house and got by 7 x 50 field glasses to help identify the object.  It was no helicopter, commerical or military aircraft, and certainly not one of those blimps that occasionally make its way down to the Ohio State University to cover a football game.  As far as I could tell, it didn&#39;t move.  There was no noise coming from it.  The object was perhaps 50 to 60 feet in diameter.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The setting sun was reflecting off the object and made it somewhat difficult to see.  As far as I could tell, there were no external lights.  There were 5 large rectangular windows that took up much of the space of this object.  There was a yellow glow in the interior.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I saw a person dressed in a light-colored single piece suit from the neck down.  The person had a head, 2 arms, and a body.  He appeared to move only once and only slightly.  It stood next to what appeared to be a &#34;file cabinet&#34;, which stood as tall as his shoulder.  There was some mass around these windows but nothing that would constitute the body of some aircraft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The next evening, my wife and I saw the same object.  I called a local television station to report what I had seen and if anybody had any idea what it was.  The lady gave me some answer and that was the last that I heard of this object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As far as I know, nothing was reported on any television news broadcast or, printed in the Columbus Dispatch.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Surely, others in the area must have seen this object.  I know what I saw, but I have no idea what I saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.  PD))<n>

It was about as high as a small plan would fly. Now get this, it looked like a bunch of balloons tied together flying across the sky (sun setting/no lights). The wind was coming out of the northwest the direction it was flying into. We agreed on its appearance, but couldn&#39;t understand how balloons could move against the wind current. I drive to school from a town called Kokomo which is 50 miles north of Indy Mon, Wed, and Fri afternoons (night classes). On my trips back home I have been witnessing strange lights in the sky since October to now (Dec). I have seen lights that fade into view move then fade out. I usually drive the country route unless of snow then I take Highway 31. Since the end of this summer I&#39;ve seen many of these strange lights in the night sky on my return trips from school. I keep forgetting to grab a camera or camcorder, but with work/school I tend to be on the move a lot (not thinking of a camera). I even stop the car to see if it&#39;s just my eyes playing tricks on me. Bingo, I see them moving in erratic patterns then fading out of site. I&#39;m just waiting for one to fly over my car and pick me up to take a ride. Hahaha, I&#39;d probably freak and run home with my tail between my legs. I have seen UFOs my whole life, but these are the most sightings I have witnessed in such a short time frame. I noticed some similar sightings on the board in Indiana by others, so I know people are seeing the same UFOs.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

We were looking between the 10:00 and 11:00 o&#39;clock position. The sighting lasted only a few seconds and then the object disapeared.

The trees are fully grown and stand maybe 50&#39; height and the sauser was hovering maybe just a few feet above them.  I only saw it because of the moon light.  It had no lights.  It was maybe about 30&#39; in diameter.  It made no noise.  I staired at it for a few moments trying to get a grip on the moment.  I called my wife to hurry out side and see this.  She was in the kitchen by the back door and came out saying &#34;What?&#34;. I pointed up and she looked up and said &#34;Oh my God&#34;.  She walked up next to me and stood there for a moment and staired at it with me.  She said &#34;Is that what I think it is?&#34;.  I responded &#34;Ya&#34;.  Then after a moment, It started to rise up, more like it was drifting up in the air like a ballon that a kid let go of at the fair.  Then when it got to the point were we had to squint our eyes to see it, it darted off at an incredible speed.  Like o MPH to hundreds of MPH in a second.

I turned and looked and saw what appeared to be one or more craft heading in a southery direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It looked as though it was one craft with two others circling the main one. It could have been just one as the distance involved (and I&#39;m not sure)could have been anywhere from 1/4 mile to a mile although it was a clear day no wind and modert tempture outside.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This craft made no engine noise left no vapor trail and the speed it seemed to travel was not slow but not fast. It also appered to be about 1200 to 1500 feet in the air as it traveled it seemed to be gaining altitude very slowely as it headed south.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was very shiney as it rotated alternetly changing from light to dark surfaces there were no lights that could be seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As for my friend and myself we are not druggies nor drunks and not prone to jokes about this and he does not know I am filing this report. He is ex miltary and we he is in his mid 40s and I&#39;m in my mid 50s so no joke folks we saw it<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

It was here last Tuesday and Wednesday nights, but I did not see it over the weekend due to low clouds and thunderstorms.  This time around it did not appear in the exact same spot the two consecutive nights, rather it appeared in slightly more easterly tonight than it did last night.  Last night there was what sounded like a single engine plane that cut a wide berth around the object, but then went on its towards Louisville.  The thing looks a lot like the North Star times five, though it blinks wildly between white, red, blue, green, and yellow...but mostly looks white.  Having observed it for many nights now, I&#39;ve almost got myself convinced that it&#39;s a particularly bright star.  But this is impossible.  I know of no star that instead of rising and setting, simply appears (although I have not witnessed this) at 3am and vanishes between 5 and 6 in the morning.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Suspected sighting of a &#34;twinkling&#34; star.

Myself and 4 other National Gaurd Soldiers, noticed two crafts that were in a heringbone formation that came from the east(possibly near Mountain Home AFB) which paused between ourselves and Mars(which was clearly visable). They had a dark purple glow, and didnt move for a period of five minutes or more. We were at the Orchard Training Area which is about 10 miles SW of Boise. I believe that, Since Area 51 was disbanded and moved to four seperate installations throughout the West, that one is near and south of Mountain Home AFB and the Orchard Training Area.

It was at a complete stop, clouds were going by it, but it remained still. Blue, red and yellow lights flashed across it&#39;s front. I could not discern the shape,but it was big - it was above the clouds, above my barn and it appeared to be approximately half as wide as my barn (20 feet). I ran in the house to get my camera; which took me no more than 30 seconds tops, and when I went back outside, it had completely disappeared; I waited for five minutes to see if it would return, but it did not.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My dog had been barking which is why I went outside. Earlier in the evening, I had been trying to make calls on my phone and first the calls would not go through, when they finally did. the line was staticy and we were cut-off.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Also, approximately two hours earlier, what sounded like a helicopter flew very low over my house.  I went outside to see what exactly it was, but I couldn&#39;t see anything in the night sky - it was very loud though and scared my dogs.<n>

It was a perfectly clear night from my vantage point (downtown Orlando was not clear as I was informed by my girlfriend who was in that area. I mention this because I know Mr. Davenport often checks local weather and other possible variables that could come into play.) I found myself starring straight up at the stars and then I noticed a type &#34;distortion&#34; of the sky directly overhead just as three small dull lights flew in a row all at the same altitude and same speed. I am not qualified to properly judge altitude, but I will state that this sighting occurred at a significantly low altitude in comparison to all other air traffic in the area. I got a real good look and as clear as the night was I could not see a body or silhouette. The lights were not blinking or pulsating. Further, If I recall correctly all aircraft under 10,000 ft. must have their lights on. I am positive there were no headlights or any blinkers, strobes, tail lights ect.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

If you&#39;ve never been to the Sky Bar it&#39;s a dimly lit outdoor bar overlooking Los Angeles, so its easy to see the night sky.  That evening was clear with a light haze in the sky.  At about 9:00PM my friend jokingly pointed to the west and said &#34;Here comes a UFO&#34;.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I looked to the west and saw what appeared to be lights in a V-formation heading directly toward us.  The objects in the formation were emitting little or no light and appeared to only be reflecting back the lights of the city.  As I looked at them I at first thought it was a flock of large white birds heading towards us.  I trained my eyes on them as they approached looking for wings.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As the objects neared and began to fly overhead I could see that there were no wings and the objects were unexplainable.  What I saw were lights in a triangle formation.  There were approximately 13 lights (1 lead and 6 on each side in a V-formation).  What made it unusual were that the rear lights were constantly switching places with each other.  The object was completely silent and moving at a speed no greater than that of an airplane.  The object also appeared to be flying at about 5,000 feet and was flying in a Northeasterly direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We both watched as the formation flew directly overhead and flew over the roof of the hotel and out of site.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object was obviously no plane as from our vantage point we could watch the airplanes approaching and landing at LAX, plus it made no sound.  Even small planes a couple miles away could be heard from our view.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I travel on business over 100,000 airline miles a year and have been doing it for 15 years straight.  I&#39;ve spent alot of time in the air and around airports and have never, ever seen anything that could explain what I saw that evening.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My friend and I were both a little shaken by the event and we both said that something needed to be reported.  That&#39;s what I&#39;m doing now.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I then saw several more appear zipping in and out at very high rates of speed.  I heard no sound.  I thought perhaps it was a search light or laser but there was no light trail.

He reported on October 13, 2003 that he was with his family driving back home on a very over cast night, with only a few stars shinning though some open patches through the cloud cover. He said it was so strange, he spotted two lights where he could see no stars shinning due to the cloud cover in the direction he was looking. As soon as he saw the two lights, another passenger in the car then noticed almost right away on his left side (drivers side) two more bright lights which appeared out of no where and were a little higher than the first two.<n> <n><n> <n><n> He mentioned that they drive by this same area almost everyday and have never notice seeing any lights before in this area  The witness also told me there is an electrical plant, I believe he meant a power sub station/transmission towers and the lights were sitting low over the power outlet. As they were watching, and making a left turn onto another road one of the passengers in the car said, &#34;the lights are moving.&#34;  They stopped the vehicle and started to watch. All of a sudden the lights changed, and in the witnesses words, they changed into the shape of a large triangular craft. All the lights which were first noticed were all white in color and one single red light at the bottom of the object in the middle. As mentioned above, he said the object was very low, he told me his best guess would have put the object some where around 200 meters off the ground and right above the power station/transmission towers. They observed the whole event for approx: 3 minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As it started to move away from the area, it first would move slowly then picked up speed very rapidly and went out of their line of sight. The fellow told me this thing moved very easily, like sitting on a cushion of air.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The gentleman said, this was a life changing experience for him.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thank you to the witness for the report.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Brian Vike, Director HBCC UFO Research Canadian Toll Free UFO Hotline 1 866 262 1989 - Free call.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Home - Phone/Fax 1 250 845 2189 HBCC UFO Forum Board http://216.147.50.102/HBCC-UFO/index.php email: hbccufo@telus.net Website: http://www3.telus.net/public/wilbur8/hbcc_ufo_research.htm<n>

WELL-THESE planes that I observed slowly passing low over my nieghborhood had several very wierd characteristrics...<n> <n><n> <n><n> #1 - NO SOUND OF A DISERNABLE JET ENGINE,even though they were low enough to where the engine drones SHOULD have been quite obvious.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I may have heard a very VERY low &#34;humming roar&#34; or drone sound - but not at the proper volume that it should&#39;ve been logically / normally - I&#39;de probably have to strain myself to hear it clearly over normal background noise coming from barking dogs,vehicles on the highway near me,etc..<n> <n><n> <n><n> #2 - They appeared to be flying so low as to be coming in on a relatively close landing approach,yet the two airports nearest me that are large enough to land a passenger jet of THAT size are in Cincinnati and Dayton - which are quite a ways away from Trenton.Large passenger jets CAN fly somewhat low over my area on final approach to either of these locations - but NOT AS LOW as these &#34;mystery planes&#34; I have observed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There are NO airports that can service that type of plane or accomodate it&#39;s landing near my home - even though the one I observed last night WAS heading in the direction of Middletown&#39;s field.The strips that are operated by the local municipal fields are simply too small,too tightly taxable,and far too short!Trying to land a large passenger jet on one of them would be catastrophic!  #3 - The plane I observed last night had it&#39;s wing tip lights TOO FAR BACK,as if it&#39;s fuselage tapered into a &#34;Delta&#34; wing configuration such as the shape reminiscent of a British Dehavilland Vampire fighter jet,a french SAB fighter,or the Concord.I know of no passenger planes - even small ones - that fly around here that have wings of that type.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  The witness provides a graphic of the object he witnessed.

It was about the size of the top of our regular brick chimney. It moved a little faster than an airliner across the sky with no sound. First saw it as it traveled south to north, lost sight of it behind a tree then it returned north to south 5-10 seconds later. this was too fast for an airliner to do a U turn. traveling north it was a little smaller and in more of an arc shape, traveling south it was larger (lower?) and in more of a V shape. it may have had more than one row of lights (we dident agree on that) We noticed that a few minutes afterward there seemed to be an unusual number of jets in the sky, though they may have been airliners and we are 20 miles from Denver international.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am an aerospace engineer and had no prior knowledge of the previous sightings of similar light patterns.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

As we were scanning the skies for something worth while to point our 8&#34; and 10&#34; dobsonian telescopes at, my friend noticed an extremely bright light in the western horizon.  We knew it wasn&#39;t a planet, as mars was to the south and east of us at the time. At first, we thought it might be an aircraft approaching us and we were just seeing the landing lights. But, the light seemed to hang in the sky south of West Mountain(western side of Utah Lake), so we knew we weren&#39;t seeing the various transmission towers on the mountain. The object appeared to hang near or above the area where the town of Eureka is located. My friend trained his 8&#34; telescope on the object, and what we saw gave us chills.  When viewed through the eyepiece, the object appeared to have 6-10 orange lights.  The lights appeared to be arranged in an ellipse.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The excitement built between us, and we kept watching the object for a few minutes longer.  After about five or six minutes, the object proceeded north above the western most mountains of Utah valley.  The object moved slowly, and maintained its intensity.  After about fifteen minutes total, the object grew dim, as if it were heading northwest from us, and then disappeared from sight entirely.<n>

This time I seen it in Bolton. Off of HWY#50 approx 14 km north of HWY#7. Was with my brother looking at the night sky and saw the same star like object moving north. Once again we both stood perfectly still and noticed that it did not fly in a straight path but wobbled. No flashing lights at all and definatly not a satelite because it was going to fly between two stars and we noticed it wobble and slow down as the stars were in the background. The object turned right and headed east. We watched it until it faded out of site.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Several days ago I noticed another star like object. This time brighter than any star. It was so bright that it looked like a ball of plasma, pure white. Heading south then turned and flew eastbound. Again, no flashing lights as an aiplane would have. I was on the phone with a friend and he also witnessed the object as we talked.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I saw the object in the Keele/HWY#7 area. He saw it from Jane st./Major Mackenzie.

I said no, because Mars was in the southern sky, and this light was towards the north.  We watched the object about 70 degrees above the horizon go in a straight line for north.  Then, it made a curve towards the North-east (at 45 degrees above the horizon) , faded out like it was going higher into the atmosphere.  This was not a satelite since it started at a dead stop.  It was not a plane, since it had no wing blinking lights, and the object was too far up for that. The object was a pure white, no yellow.  It was a sphere and only dimmed in intensity as it curved and head to higher altitudes until it was a tiny point, and kept going until other buildings obscured the view. This sight was only 3 miles form Johnson City where another report was recently made.

At first I thought they were search lights coming from a casino that the indians run but as it got closer it was two faint balls of light. As one ball was rotating down the other was rotating up. They were very faint but larger in diameter. It came from the south and was heading north north west across the sky. I have seen alot in the sky out here and all was able to be explained. I would love to hear that this was no big deal because I do not as of tonight, beleive in UFO&#39;s. There was no noise coming from this object, and it had to be in the atmosphere. I called a friend who is a pilot for America West and he is going to call his friends at Sky Harbour airport to see if anyone else saw what I saw. At about 8:00pm my wife and sister in law saw several aircraft above out house circling as if they were looking for something.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

10/13/03 17:00|Kansas ??  (In-flight sighting)|KS|Unknown|15 - 20 minutes|Huge Unknown Phenomenon (Distant Stobe Effects) Seen From Airplane Window on Cross-Country Flight|3/23/04|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/035/S35758.html|322|ndxe200310| Huge Unknown Phenomenon (Distant Stobe Effects) Seen From Airplane Window on Cross-Country Flight<n> <n><n> <n><n> I must admit, I have been curious about UFO phenomenon since a very young age.  I am 31 as of this writing.  Indeed, I had always wanted to see something, but never had.  I figured that I was just one of the &#34;unlucky ones&#34;.  Perhaps there wasn&#39;t anything to see anyway.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was raised as a Roman Catholic but have never held tightly to those beliefs as I grew older, allthough I do not discount all the ideas embodied therein.  I have never had a truly close relationship with my father, however, if there was one thing he has given me, it is a healthy respect, and dare I say, reverence for the truth.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I will also plainly admit that I have engaged on more than one occasion in the use of various mind altering substances.  My primary purpose being that of self discovery.  Having said that, I was not under the influence of any substance at the time of this sighting.  Furthermore, I do not suffer from what might be called &#34;flashbacks&#34;.  Unfortunetly, I do not have a doctor&#39;s not to prove this.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Hopefuly this rambling prologue will make sense as I continue.  I feel it will provide necessary insight into my mindset and my validity as a witness.  I can only recount my experiences as truthfuly as I can.<n> <n><n> <n><n> And now my testimony:  As mentioned above, I&#39;ve always been fascinated by UFO&#39;s.  And it were these thoughts that crossed my mind while I was flying back to Washington D.C. from Denver, Colorado.  I figured &#34;What better vantage point than above the clouds to see something.&#34;  It was to my great pleasure that I ended up with a window seat for my return leg.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was transfixed by the view out the window for almost the entire flight.  About half an hour into the flight, I figured I&#39;d try a little experiment.  You could call it &#34;sending up a mental flare&#34;.  If there was really anything out I figure I&#39;d try to communicate, to use the term very loosely, with it.  Basically, all this consisted of was me projecting my thoughts into the vast open sky in front of me.  &#34;Show me you&#39;re out there.  Do something!&#34;  As I recall we were travelling between 35 and 40 thousand feet (as noted on that tiny tv on the back of the seat in front of me).  I seem to remember we were travelling at slightly over 500 mph.  Apparently we had a good tail wind.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In retrospect, I should have been more &#34;scientific&#34; in noting the exact altitude, time, and location, but in all actuality, I wasn&#39;t expecting to see anything.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was just starting to get dark, kind of grey-pale blue outside but still plenty of light.  My flight left at ~ 3:30 PM Denver time, and the incident occurred about 45 minutes into the flight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> From my view out the window, I could tell we were well above the main cloud deck.  Looking straight down, you could not really see the ground except only ocassionaly.  We weren&#39;t above storm clouds per se, they were the more whispy stratus type. The horizon line, however, was marked by a line of cumulonimbus (?) exteneding from left to right across the horizon with the some large gaps between the tops of them.  They got fatter towards their base were they merged with the cloud deck.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I could see some cloud to cloud lightning off to the left of my field of view.  You couldn&#39;t see the source, you would just see the cloud light up from the inside.  This activity wasn&#39;t very intense, was rather sporatic, and produced a diffuse lighting effect on the cloud.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was approximately 10 - 15 minutes after my &#34;message&#34; that I noticed that a very bright red-blue strobe began flashing out on the horizon.  It was really at the far edge of my visability.  Not that it was hard to see, more that it was the furthest thing I could see.  It appeared to be on the horizon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> For a while, I thought it must be the strobe light from another airplane.  Its pulsating was more or less regular, but the object remained motionless on the horizon for quite some time.  It would flash deep red at first, quickly followed by secondary and tertiary strobes with a more blue or darker colored tint.  The secondary flashes occurred (from what I could tell) in the same place as the primary strobe.  Its size was approximately 2-3 times Venus (?).<n> <n><n> <n><n> Needless to say, I was quite intrigued by this development.  The strobe seemed really bright for being so far away. (orders of magnitiude brighter than the cloud lightning; clear and defined).  I finally decided it couldn&#39;t be written off as lightning because it was in the open and not behind any cloud, besides the fact that it was more a point of light than anything else.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I watched this remain more or less motionless for some time, maybe 5 to 10 minutes.  I can&#39;t say it was completely motionless as I would look back inside the cabin ocassionaly to gauge the reaction of the other passangers.  No one seemed to notice.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After a while I started to think &#34;Is this it? Is this all I&#39;m gonna get?&#34;  So I issued another communication: &#34;Your going to have to do better than that!&#34;  I looked inside the cabin, back out, back in, out again.  The strobe was still there.  I was flabbergasted.  Every time I looked, it was still there.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Eventaully, the strobe moved slightly to the right of my field of vision, almost going behind a large cloud.  I figured &#34;Ah-ha, it must be another plane.&#34;  But it never went BEHIND the cloud.  Or in front of it for that matter.  It never came closer or moved further away.  It just kind of stood there on the edge of the cloud, flashing every 10 - 15 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At this point I had been watching it on and off for what felt like quite a while.  Everyone else as far as I could tell was still going on about their business.  The young woman next to me was talking about meaningless career climbing nonsense with an older gentleman in the aisle seat.  This is when I notice a pronounced change in the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object was still on the edge of this large cloud.  However, each initial burst was now followed by much more chaotic secondary and tertiary strobes of light that covered what appeared to be a HUGE area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The first stobe would flash at the bottom of the object and was followed by a series of strobes that climbed higher and wider up along the edge of the cloud.  Plese note that at this point there was still a gap between the object and the cloud.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It continued to flash at more or less regular intervals and seemed to outline a HUGE shape.  Almost triangular, like an inverted pyramid.  I couldn&#39;t tell.  It was getting darker at this point, but still not what I would consider night.  The space between the strobes was rather dark and I wasn&#39;t able to make out any discernable &#34;edge&#34; to the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I sat there in awe.  The size of this thing seemed immense.  I would estimate that it was approximately one-third (1/3) the height of the visable part of the cloud; the part that extended above the main cloud deck.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I watched this go on for 5 - 10 minutes.   Red-blue initial flashes at its base followed by a succession of chaotic flashes that seemed to cascade upwards to the &#34;top&#34; of the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This large object remained stationary (from my perspective) at the edge of the cloud for some time.  The flashes were so intense at this point that you could see it light up the edge of the cloud it was next to.  Later, you could actually see the cloud being backlit by these flashes.  The object did not initially appear to be behind the cloud, or at least I would say that most of the object was not behind the cloud.  Since my plane was moving and hence my sightline was continually changing, my view of the object must have changed, possibly explaing why initialy the large object appeared be in the open. Only toward the end of the sighting did I see the dramatic backlighting effects.  The initial effects only lit up the edge of the cloud.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The second larger object never approached us either, nor did it ever seem to move further away.  It did not make any real &#34;maneuvers&#34; at all.  Throughout the sighting, from the initial single light to the last time I saw it, the object seemed to remain between two large clouds.  It did not appear to climb or descend in altitude.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Also, please note, that the times I have given as to the duration of the sighting are approximate.  Needless to say, it seemed to go on for a VERY long time.  In fact, I watched it for so long that I eventually thought to myself, &#34;Allright, enough alredy.  I&#39;m getting tired of this.  You&#39;ve proved your point.&#34;  I wanted to get a nap in.  Unfortunelty, I never really did drift off.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I returned my gaze to the interior of the cabin.  The next time I looked out the window the object was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I never mentioned it to the other passengers or crew.  As you can see from the above account, this was a very &#34;personal&#34; experience.  I felt at the time, perhaps somewhat selfishly, that this was FOR ME.  If no one else saw it, that was THEIR fault.  I mean, it was pretty hard to miss.  There was NOTHING else like it in the sky at the time.  In fact, I find it hard to believe that the pilots themselves could have missed it, allthough I assume it might have been somewhat behind their line of sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I would also like to note, that shortly before this sighting began, we passed another plane heading west and flying slightly lower than us.  I was kind of surprised to see another plan so close to us ... probably less than 1/2 a mile away and probably 1000 - 2000 ft lower in altitude.  (I have tried to refrain from using guestimates as to the size and distance of things up to this point because I really have no clue as to the scale of things from that perspective.)  For what its worth, I noted the size and brightness of the passing plane&#39;s strobes, and the initial single object I saw (as well as the larger object seen later in the sighting) was MUCH brighter and appeared SIGNIFICANTLY larger than this plane&#39;s strobe, not to mention it was MUCH further away.  Additionaly, the palne&#39;s strobes were mostly white, while the object on the horizon was mostly deep reds and blues.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In conclusion, I really don&#39;t know WHAT it is I saw.  I merely know I saw something.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Perhaps I saw exactly what I wanted to.  Maybe I saw exactly what I NEEDED to.  Whatever the answer, I&#39;m buying a digital camera and keeping it handy on my next plane trip. ;^)  Sorry this is so long.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

The object descended for a period of about two minutes while she drove to the health club.  She parked the car and went into the health club and brought out an attendant to witness the object.  The object was visible for another ten seconds before it went behind the tree line.  The impact point would likely have been Lake Ontario.

He claimed to watch a light for 45 minutes with it moving very little.  Military jets followed behind.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I work in Evansville right off of HWY41 (only a field is between my DC and hwy 41)It only takes me approx 16mins to get home from work at night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I listen to c2c on the way home and have often said dang I never see anything.  I travel east from HWY 41 down Lynch Rd toward I-64. 3 blocks from work there is very little artifical light and open fields so I have a clear view of the night sky for miles and miles.  There is an Airport (evansville regional) north less than 10 miles.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Starting in October I&#39;ve noticed a bright light in the direction I&#39;m traveling  just a degree or so south of Lynch Road. I note this cause like the other man I see it a long time and it only seems to move left and right slightly.  I spectulated as to what it was ..something traveling toward me?  A balloon? Mars?  A Star?  Lynch road was built up to the I-64 bypass and there it ends uphill into farmland.  If Lynch was 12o&#39;clock then the light was at 1:30am.  It glowed and shimmered like heat on blacktop. From 2 miles away it was just smaller than a dime. (I held one up) Seeing it as I traveled it seemed not natural or right. There was only one big light as if it were a tiny star hovering over a field I could see a silo slightly North of it.  I watched it more than I watch the road. I was driving straight toward it trying to see it but I couldnt actually focus on it. I thought I could make out a shape in the glow cause I was kinda making a joke about it to myself ..here&#39;s my c2c call! I was thinking how could I descibe it to Art Bell. &#34;Round bright slightly shimmering light seeming to cover something not quite circular.&#34; I entered the I-64 ramp but I stopped trying to see it better it never moved.  I couldnt focus good on it beyond the light so I continued on I-64 traveling south toward Indiana 66...looking left at the light it suddenly blinks out. well I thought whatever it is it&#39;s gone.  At that moment  large heavy duty helicopters flew over there were 3 of them in formation traveling Southeast in a straight line toward where ALCOA sits on the Ohio River. Of course I&#39;m thinking wow..this was an Art Bell moment.  I had that same moment for the next 5 weeks either on wens or thursday nights.  Big light...Military choppers. I know that Indiana has military bases and Kentucky has them too.  It&#39;s not heard of but not too common for those big choppers to travel over us.  I was wondering if a map was out is Sulliivan/Evansville-Newburgh/Moorehead in a light with each other? I havent seen the light or military aircraft since right before thanksgiving.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There are all kinds of Natural caves in these area&#39;s plenty of hidey holes!<n>

It almost sounded like a very loud car engine so I muted my television. The sound began to get muffled &amp; lower. I looked outside the window &amp; above the trees I could see red,blue &amp; white lights. At first I thought it was just a plane or a helicopter, but the object didnt move. The lights continued to flicker so I just continued to watch. After 5 minutes I woke my husband up to also look at it. I really thought I was seeing things. But there its was an object in the sky with flashing lights. I kept walking away &amp; going back to look at it. My husband thought it was a plane also, but even he said its not moving. 10 mins later a plane was flying nearby &amp; 5 mins later it just disappeared. Did anyone else see these lights in the sky over southern florida, early wednesday morning between 1a-115a ?<n>

Obviously, those planes are huge and, because they are so big, they just give the visual impression that they are just lumbering along at a very slow rate of speed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It&#39;s very possible that your observer saw one of these planes on approach to Wright-Patt.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

About a year and half ago I went out the back door at a local mill in the industrial site say around 11:00 p.m. in October I happen to look up and from a south to north east angle I saw five small red dots in the sky,  funny thing is that they were perfectly staggered behind one another,same distance apart.I went back in the mill to tell a coworkers but by the time we got back they were gone.Just thought it was a strange thing to see at the time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It looked something like this!!

At the end of the night, I went outside and waited for my friends to say goodbye. I felt as though there were someone standing near me, I turned and noticed a glowing red sphere. At first I thought my eyes were playinig tricks on me. Then I felt a bit of surprise as I realized this was not an illusion; instantaneously the object moved two feet back. I calmed myself and spoke to the object, complimenting it&#39;s colors. The sphere was approximately 12 inches in diameter and had what appeared to be divits spaced two inches apart on the surface. These divits were brighter and lighter than the overall object, which glowed a luminous red. Gazing at the sphere, I noticed it was translucent. I was distracted by my friend talking to me. As I turned back to see the object, it was gone. I looked around and noticed it had moved five houses down the street.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Some of our other co-workers who left in 1 car just before us turned back to tells us there are U.F.O.s in the sky so my friend and i drove towards it but it must have been really far away because we weren&#39;t getting any closer but the light was so bright we thought it was close. It started off as 4 seperate crafts, although like one i had seen months before i couldnt see the actual craft just one bright like to each craft.  The lights started off as 3 in a line then one under the middle light. As we got closer we could only see 3 then one would be really low to the ground then one would be really high.  The formations were always changing but the lights were always where we could see them.  I called my brother at 9:30 who was babysitting to tell him and he didn&#39;t really believe me then at about midnight when he was driving home from babysitting he and his girlfriend saw the same thing in the same direction I saw it in.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

However, it may be a star or planet.  It is simply a round, indistinct light, photographed against a featureless sky.  Orbiting objects do not remain motionless in the night sky.  PD))<n> <n><n> <n><n> Orange Ball Joined By Second That Formed a Debris Field - Filmed<n> <n><n> <n><n> Orange ball object slightly to my North North East. Two to three times bigger than Mars the last few weeks. Sun was just about to set, but was still daylight. That&#39;s what caught my attention, seemed to early for such a bright star. A plane flew in the general vicinity and the red lights were not the orange of the circle of light.... sooo.... I went inside and got my hi 8 camera and came out and filmed. Seemed like it had moved south since I had I eye balled it last ..... continued filming while standing. Decided with the zooming I was doing I needed to lay down on the deck and film from a more stable position. Did that and filmed close ups. No details, just a orange ball of light, but not a star. Then ........... then I noticed some other white balls of light near by, there was a large cluster of em! ....and they were &#39;drifting&#39; to the north and spreading out. Must have been more than a dozen. Dispersing with out any trails of anykind, just like watching the ufo footage over Washington DC in the fifty&#39;s!! As the sun set they all got dimmer until they were gone. Had to be very very high altitude, and I suspect in orbit, as the several minutes I filmed them they didn&#39;t not travel far. The low angle of the sun lit up what ever was in orbit.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After reviewing the tape a few times, I have reached several conclusions.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I don&#39;t know what the orange colored circular object is, but I suspect it was in orbit and reflecting the sun. It has to be huge, much larger than the ISS.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Something broke apart in orbit and followed a path away from the orange colored circular object, but no noticeable change in appearance to the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The &#39;debris&#39; field and path looks more like the shuttle break up footage than the &#39;Washington Fifty&#39;s Ufo&#39;s&#34; The reason it looked like that to me was the poor detail of the eyepiece I was viewing through in real time while filming. The difference in this footage to the shuttle break up is that there is no fire, no smoke, no contrails, no paths of any kind.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Seeing the debris field expand, it can be noticed that some of the &#39;objects&#39; are tumbling and reflecting light differently as they travel. Two or three brighter bigger objects don&#39;t seem to be tumbling so much.  There are dozens of &#39;piece&#39;s.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The brightness of all the objects decreases with the setting sun, with the larger orange colored circular object being seen first and last.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The path of the debris field is in a Northerly direction, which is damn peculiar for a geo sync object...... if the two events are related that is.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Due to the high strangeness of each, I suspect they are.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Filmed in regular eye light spectrum and infra red &#34;SonyNightShot&#34; mode. Images of the mystery objects were much brighter in the night shot mode ..... Orange ball was visible to the naked eye. Once you know there was a debris field from the camera shot, it was noticeable as a &#39;smudge&#39; to the naked eye.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In the last few days my thinking is that what I may have filmed is an asteroid coming right at us so the field of motion was considerably reduced.<n> <n><n> <n><n> With the high rate of meteorites streaking across the sky world wide of late, and the closest pass of an asteroid ever just last month, I am wondering if this is a continuation of that activity.<n> <n><n> <n><n> IF this is the case, then I may have come close to filming dooms day....<n> <n><n> <n><n> especially from the debris fields visible in this footage. Have emailed 101203.zip that contains several high resolution frame captures from the film.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((name deleted))<n>
10/12/03 18:25|Rosamond|CA|Other|8 minutes|Two Brilliant Star objects in twilight sky|10/15/03|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/032/S32213.html|335|ndxe200310| Two Brilliant Star objects in twilight sky<n> <n><n> <n><n> Rosamond, California October 12, 2003 - Sunday 18:25 P.M., My son-in-law and I just finished loading a few items into his pickup truck. As we stood there talking in front of my house,for some unexplained reason I looked up into the sky and as I did, there in the southern sky about 60 degrees off the horizon, were 2 very large brilliant stars situated side by side. I got my son-in-laws attention immediately,and asked him if he knew what these 2 stars where. My son-in-law who is a school teacher could not identify them either.It was a twilight sky, and too early for any stars to appear yet. We stood there puzzled not being able to determine what or why these stars were so visible when there were no ohter stars visible yet. One of the stars was more like golden yellow orange color and the other was a brilliant white star. After what seemed less than a minute,I thought the white star accually moved downward from the other star. I asked my son-in-law if he thought the white star had moved and he confirmed that it did. A second or two later the white star began a more progressive movement downward from the other star. I then realized that this was no star and I ran into the house to retrieve my binoculars making my way out to the backyard patio. As I focused in on the descending star, I could see that it was a brilliant object some great distance away. It was now in a constant slow decent. I then rushed back into the house to grab my video camera. By the this time my son-in-law, daughter and wife were outside and they too had sight of this object moving down. As I returned back into the backyard with my camcorder the object was now very low in the horizon and dropping very fast. I could not locate the object in the viewfinder and lost the chance to get any video, before it became obscured by the neighborhood surrounding tree line. The sighting of this star object lasted 1 minute. As for the other orange star object,it now seemed to move further down from its original sighted position (40 degre! es of horizon)and relocated itself in the southeastern horizon.This star object had moved in the time that my son-in-law and I moved to the backyard from the front of the house. However,neither one of us accually saw it move. At this new position, the orange star object stayed in this location for several minutes. We all went into the house after this. I returned to the backyard and by now I could no longer see it,but in its last location, the planet Mars was now becoming visible. Something strange happened during our observation of this orange star and I find words difficult to explain it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Some people may want to interpret our observation of the orange star as being the planet Mars. To them I will say this; The planet Mars does not make its appearence in the southeastern sky, here in southern California, until 18:45 PM, at which time it first appears at a low 30 degrees off the horizon. It is a faint yellow and is not easy to see at this time. It does not begin to take on a orange color until 19:40 PM, when its position is about 70 degrees off horizon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My son-n-law and I are convinced that these were not stars,flares,meteors,aircraft, balloons or any other objects known to us. I&#39;m a retired Air Force veteran with 24 years experience in aircraft operations. I can honestly say that I can&#39;t correlate this to anything I&#39;ve ever seen. I feel that others may have witnessed this event as well. It was too obvious not to have been noticed. I checked with the 3 local newspapers for any reports the next day. Nothing unusual was reported relating to this starnge sighting. I also contacted the community affairs office at nearby Edwards Air Force Base and they had no reports or similar reports to thier office. For now I choose to classify this as a UFO sighting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with this witness via telephone, and we found him to be exceptionally credible.  We were satisfied that he would have been able to distinguish the lights from landing lights on aircraft, a possibility he had considered.  PD))<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  This is one of two seemingly quite credible reports from Rosamond, CA, submitted by this witness, submitted over the course of two years.  This witness seems to us to be exceptionally qualified as an observer.  PD))<n>

My dad was trying to get the odject in veiw with the veiw finder thing while I was looking at the object through the lense.  It looked like a rock with red edges.  Then my little brother looked at it and agreed with me.  My dad never got to look at it through the telescope.

I thought that one of my friends was playing a trick but when I came close to the tree i noticed that about 100 feet up was an akwardly shaped object. I called my friend over and when we saw it he could not believe it, the object was star shaped with extra corner sticking out in random spots.

I alerted other people in the car with me.I could tell it wasnt a star because it was so close to the ground it seemed like it was a little further than lone tree rd. It was moving consistenly to the left at a very slow slow pace and then it just stopped and hovered in the same place for about 10 min. Then another person came out and we showed him the light in the sky because we were tripping out. It wasnt blinking, like a plane it wasnt going fast like a shooting star it was moving and now hovering in the same place. Then almost as if it knew we were watching it moved to the left about 20 feet again but out of our site. We got out of the car, moved so we can see it again and then it moved again and hovered and all of a sudden we looked up and it was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

We like to just sit out in certain spots and listen to music talk about our days we do this sometimes up to 1am.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So on october the 12 Sunday i remember specifically because we were whining about working the next day.  My friend Greg and I were sitting in his truck facing North East. I have seen NUMEROUS shooting stars i have watched meteor showers and this was no shooting star!<n> <n><n> <n><n> So about 12:00am we were listening to music when out of the corner of my left eye From the north west direction I see a Burning red light falling SLOWLY in a parallel motion it fell so slow that i had time to look over It was intense red like it had just burned in from the atmosphere almost?   Then it stops turns the brightest of green and fly in the north east direction paralell once again and vanishes in a brilliant greenish/blue flash.  This happened in a matter of seconds but a shooting start wouldnt have give me time enough to look before it burnt out and sure as heck wouldn&#39;t have shot back into the sky!  I looked at my friend Greg and said GREG i just saw some craziness, he said huh?  He hadn&#39;t seen it, but told me he HAS scene the same type of thing in our town before, so being me i ask around to other people id say about 5 people i asked have seen some mysterious flying object here.  We are 40miles from Edwards Airforce base but 20 miles from Lockead Skunk Works.  All i can say is i have been searching to see one since i was a boy in New Mexico would stare out of windows forever at 5 years old and now 15 years later i see it not expecting to :)  We aren&#39;t alone and this is for sure:)  100billion stars in our milkyway galaxy they say, and there could be up to 400billion in it but 300 of which we cannot detect and each star could possably be surrounded by a Earth like planet figure the equation :)<n>

It was bright enough to be able to see well enough to walk without a flashlight.  It was not raining and the temperature was cool. I noticed an uneven break in the clouds at about 75 degrees from the horizon and pointed it out to my brother and daughter who were with me.  We noted that there was a very dark black cloud right behind this light area, and no other dark clouds in the sky.  The object moved from South to North very slowly but the bright light did not change shape, so I began to suspect that we were not looking at a break in the clouds at all, but rather a craft of some sort with a round half moon shape with fog concealing it.  The black cloud did change shape constantly and looked like some type of exhaust, but it stayed right behind the bright object.  At one point, I could see stars behind both the black and white areas at the same time.  It was very large - the size of a lunch plate held at arm&#39;s length. No sound was heard by any of us. We watched it for about 10 minutes until it dissapeared from sight.  It is hard to explain, but I &#34;felt&#34; that it was a very large craft that might have been transparent with a black exhaust coming from it.  I would be very interested in finding out if anyone else saw this. It is interesting to note that I drove my brother home right after this incident and after only 10 minutes we saw that the entire sky was free of any fog,haze or clouds, and the full moon was out.  I wonder if the UFO caused the fog in order to conceal itself. I have no photos as I knew they would not come out, but I could do a drawing of it if desired.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I have always considered myself to be a sensible person and faith believing.  What I saw on that cold evening in the sky left me puzzeled.  This object was at my best guestimation 70 to 80 feet across with lights on the bottom of this disk. The lights were moving from the outer edge toward the center in the shapes of rectangles.  It appeared to have louvers toward the center.  When the light reached the center it would radiate back out toward the edge.  It appeared as if you were looking in a kaleidoscope.  The lights were a brilliant white.  I watched this for 3 minutes as it moved from northeast direction to a southwest direction.  I went to the house to get my husband.  When we came out, it was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

We went inside becuase it got dark and chilly. As soon as we walked in one of my friends said he felt something weird by the door. I stood by the door and felt the breeze but nothing else. He stood by the door again but he said he felt a painless, pulsating throb in his head with a sort of hum. I stood by the door but felt nothing. We forgot about the incident and sat down to watch TV. About a half hour later we saw a large flash outside the window it was either blue or green. It was so bright it felt like several cars were in the backyard with their brights on. This light was also accompanied by a loud and low hum that rattled the kitchen window and a painless electric feeling on the couches we were sitting on. This lasted for a solid 5 to 10 seconds. We ran outside thinking lightning struck the house, nothing was burnt not their was any clouds in the sky. We noticed about half a mile away from the house was a white suv that was motionless in the middle of the road and then proceeded slowly on its way as if it had seen something. We went to the front yard for about 15 minutes duting this time a neighbor that said he lived about a quarter mile away asked if we had seen &#34;it.&#34; We told him what we saw and he said he thought it was in his backyard as well. Shortly after we saw a young kid with a flashlight looking around telepone poles stating he also saw a blue light out side his window.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
10/11/03 19:05|Placerville|CA|Light|Ten minutes|Unverified pair of bold star lights diminishing in perfect unison.|10/31/03|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/032/S32346.html|344|ndxe200310| Unverified pair of bold star lights diminishing in perfect unison.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Upon driving from Apple Hill Farms located 10 miles east of Placerville CA heading west to Sacramento CA, I decided to exit highway 50 into Eldorado County which is approximately 30 miles or more east of Sacramento.  I had anticipated the Moon rising around that time of the evening as it was almost a perfectly dark sky with vivid stars in appearance.  The planet Mars was already up in the east-south-east direction maybe 40+ degrees [10 oclock high] above the horizon.  I made an exit from the freeway and took a main road traveling back east and found an open hill area that I could set up my camera and take some time lapse photo&#39;s of the full Moon rising.  While waiting patently for this to transform [30 minutes]the planet Mars had two neighbors that I thought to be stars in the distance to the left of it, which was nothing unusual, just as bright as your brightest star in the sky but bold.  I kept notice of the two neighbors of Mars because they were easy to behold and I didn&#39;t recognize any star pattern that they belonged to, which I&#39;m not a serious avid star gazer.  As I was shooting the Moon rising photo&#39;s I looked serveral times at the lights [or stars] next to Mars [approx a minute at a time] and the final time I looked the two star lights begin to diminish in perfect sequence, exact correlating unison and vanished.  The receding of their light took about seven seconds to dimenish altogether in unison from their star like brightness to nothing. They never moved, completely stationary all the time, and that&#39;s why I thought they were bold bright stars setting in the sky.  I continued to check the sky to see if maybe a patch of high clouds were obscuring their visibility, and I looked for possible high fog patches passing through the sky as well, but I didn&#39;t see any of these effects. Neither of the other sky objects were affected, all the stars and the planet Mars which were within close radius of the two star lights were never affected and their brightness never diminished at all.  Th! e sky was basically clear during that time of the evening except for a few stray patches of clouds/fog sitting on the horizon when the moon begin to rise.  Although it has been over a week since I viewed this amazing specticle of objects in unison I continue to check the sky each night to make sure that the star lights I saw were not stars hidden by a sweep of the milky way and to my amazement I have yet to see those star lights or objects again, neither can I correlate any of the stars or planets in the sky to the placement of where the objects were. I&#39;m still looking each night but I have found no resemblance of distance or pattern of objects to relate.  The Moon was rising far to the left of the planet Mars which was already up in the sky, and Mars temporary neighbors were about two tenths of the distance from Mars judging from the the total distance between the Moon and Mars.  If anyone has an explanation I would appreciate being informed. I considered maybe a satelite or orbiting objects from earth, but the star lights I witnessed were stationary through out the duration [over 30 minutes].<n> <n><n> <n><n>

About 1 pm the pilot put on the seatbelt sign and told us we were just on the edge of a cold front that was passing through Minneapolis and we may experience a &#34;few bumps.&#34; I thought I would snap a picture of the clouds we were above just for a future screensaver. I must add that about 30 mins earlier I nudged my wife to see a passing airplane because I&#39;m always in awe of seeing a plane pass in the opposite direction. The sense of speed one gets is amazing. The passing plane also produced a great contrail. Like I stated, I turned my digital camera to the window, and as I was framing the shot I caught a flash of what I thought was a reflection from the wing. I snapped the shot and immediately took the camera down and checked the shot in the camera&#39;s screen. The Sony camera (DSC-1) has a very small screen and since I was not wearing my reading glasses, I was only able to view the basic composition and exposure. Satisfied, I put the camera away and enjoyed the rest of the flight. The next day I downloaded all my shots from the trip (70+) with the flight shot being the last one. When it popped up on the screen I was shocked at what I saw. There in the distance was an object forward of the right wing. I describe it as cigar shaped, with 3 areas of brightness along its edge and what appears to be a darker area barely visible at its mid section along the top edge. The object also has a yellowish glow around it. For a fact I know there were no other aircraft (planes) within the area at the time, because after the few seconds it took to check the camera I returned to gazing out the window, I saw nothing. I have the shot. I am reluctant to show it beyond those I&#39;ve shown it to already. I don&#39;t need to be suspect, however I would certainly rest easier if I knew what I captured with my camera. Thank you.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous.  No contact information appears to have been provided.

I saw in the sky two round disks white in color with smokelike clouds around it and flying very jerky movements. they were making 90 degrees turns like chaseing each other. When one of them turned, I saw the sun reflect off the disk. then just like that they were out of sight. All of this lasted for about 30-40 seconds. I am retired 62 year old Real estate Broker and live in a trailer park in Newaygo County, Michigan. I have seen something like this once before about two yrs earler. At that time it was bright and sunny and I was at a flea market and I seen this white ball crossing the sky ,ther was no sound and it was out of site in 10 seconds heading south to north.

It was about 3:00am when we were about a mile or less from Truckee.  In the sky to the left (from my position, it would be at the top left edge of the windshield) we both saw a light blue almost white perfectly spherical object with a darker blue horizontal line across the center.  It also appeared that there was an aura of the same darker blue around the object.  From our vantage point in the car, the object appeared about the size of a normal full moon.  It slowly travelled in a straight diagonal line to the left, then went in a slight arc downward behind a small mountain just off the highway.  By the time we reached a point on the highway where we could see where the object would have been there was nothing there<n>

The ceiling fan above me was not on. I have five small dogs two were out (out meaning having run of the house) the others were in their sleeping crates. Well the story just about ends here because I saw nothing. Here is what did happen I awoke sometime in the midmorning with all the dogs sleeping as close to my head neck area as they could muster, I was VERY groggy but was stunned to see the ceiling fan going faster than it is designed to go. I mean it was spinning wildly almost as if it would spin right off the ceiling. Still groggy and having to go to the bathroom I stood and went to the hall at which point I notice the swamp cooler was not on (I keep it on 24 hours a day) I went to switch on the hall light and got no response I looked at the swamp cooler switch and it was on. Almost forgot to mention TV was off though on when I fell asleep also I live alone.Returning from the bathroom I picked up to cordless phone and it didn&#39;t work went to the other phone and same thing.  The cable box above the TV no longer showed the time which is constant and contolled by the cable company. I felt, not sick, but like my ying and yang were off. Just out of sorts. I called my mom and arranged to go have lunch.I went out to the fuse box to flip the switch thinking something broke the circut. But there were no switches down. Flipped them all anyway. Once inside nothing came back on. Except the ceiling fan. Went to meet my mom and before I got out of the car looked in the mirror and noticed brown dried stuff from my ear down the side of my face. It was obviously dried blood. I asked my mom after cleaning area to look inside my ear she said I must have cut myself because there was a mark inside the ear. Well I don&#39;t pick or scratch at my ear and the amount of blood that had poured out was mu! ch much more than a fingernail scratch could produce. When I saw my mom she said she had been concerned because she had tried calling and the machine didn&#39;t pick up and after two days she grew worried.....TWO DAYS?? &#34;What do you mean two days Mom I just saw you yesterday! &#34;No that was two days ago this being the third day&#34;  I am dumbfounded I slept for two full days and two full nights. Impossible!!! I would at least awaken to go to the bathroom but didn&#39;t. When I got home I called an electrical contractor friend who came out and said there was nothing wrong with the fuses and that power was still coming to the house. He couldn&#39;t figure out what was wrong. This is an electrical contractor! I felt to crummy to deal with this. So I left the house and went to a friends house and then to feed my horse. When I got home the swamp cooler was on and working as was the hall light. The tv and cable box were not on I found a few outlets that had power and plugged the tv and cable box in and much to my surprise found that they were &#34;fried&#34; as was both phones answering machine and get this the surge protector!! Fried! None of my neighbors had their power out and SDG&amp;E said there was no spike in my area. That is all I am quite curious as to what caused this and if my ear and sleeping for a stunning two full days and nights are at all related. It is noteworthy to mention I do not take drugs and do not drink. Any insight? I am perplexed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

We left his house and proceeded to drive around the local fields shining deer. We saw 3 6 point bucks and a few does throughout the night. As we saw less and less deer we took it easy...listening to the radio and talking about what would be going on the following weekend. We lost track of time and headed back towards home slowly at around 11pm sometime, driving slowly to shine deer in the fields on the way back to his house. We turned on the road he lives on(dead end) and proceeded down to his house(going South). As we came closer to his house I noticed an orange glowing craft which looked like it was over his neighbors house.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As we got closer we noticed that it wasn&#39;t. It was infact sitting completely still about 150 yards into the field just beyond their house from the road and about 170 or so yards inward from the North. The craft was like a glowing orange about the size of a full moon at night..so it seemed some-what big...but since we had no background reference we couldn&#39;t tell how far away it was therefore unable to determine its size. How we came to find out where this craft was was when it began to move. Anyways, I pointed at it from the passenger side and told him to look(he was driving). And we slowed down to a stop where it was almost perfectly parralel to us out the driver side window. This was not a normal orange glow, but rather look like fancy flares of light being emitted from this craft. At the very &#34;center&#34; of this craft it was a very bright orange/white color, and as light emitted from it, the light very quickly became a very dark orange. We sat there for about 6 or 7 seconds watching this still craft in the air which was &#34;over&#34; the tree line to us...so we also couldn&#39;t tell exactly how high it was. But to find out later, it was only about 40-50 ft off the ground. After those few seconds where it was completely still and making no sound, the craft began moving towards the north at an undeterminable speed because as stated before, we couldnt tell how far away it was. The action in which it took off was very unique, it went from a dead stop and began moving north which we found out later to be at a VERY slow speed because it was so close. It&#39;s stop to go motion was exactly like seeing an aircraft flying in the air on video, pausing it, and then playing it again. In other words, it seemed to just &#34;be&#34; at that speed...no acceleration. Anyway, after those few moments of watching it travel to the north it, I promptly had to the idea to shine our spot light at it in which my friend grabbed the spot light and quickly aimed the light at it and I bluntly told him to Hit IT! He shined the light once at it for about a duration of 1/5-3/4 second. Almost immediately after that, the craft blinked a large blue light back at us from the &#34;upper right&#34; area of the craft. It was pretty big and could see that the light was being emitted from some sort of &#34;stick&#34; which was simply a rod that had to brightest glow and the actual emitting light was a bit darker. Right after that I said HIT IT AGAIN and he did and it flashed a big blue light at us a second time! I dont remember what I said next, but he flashed the light a third time and the craft emitted two flashes of light very quickly, and when we signaled back a fourth time it then emitted two slow flashes of light, acknowledging our signals to it. It was just a moment of awe...a few moments later to object finally got the the point where we couldnt watch it very good from the truck...so we both got out and began walking down the road in the direction it was flying(N).  When it finally got to the end of the field(north side, still a ways in) we finally saw its light shining off the tree tops it was heading toward. It was 10-15ft above the trees and as it approached one tree, it &#34;jumped&#34; up in the air a ways as if it were going to hit it. Then it came back down to the exact height it was previously at and was again close to another tree still heading north at the same speed. It then &#34;jumped&#34; over the second bigger tree, came down a bit, and &#34;leaped&#34; over the third tree. All three of which are in his neighbors horse pasture behind their house, right next to the field. Still at the same speed, it went behind some other trees(pine) where we couldn&#39;t see it very good...after awhile it finally got past the trees and began heading north-west and slowly flew over his other neighbors house and stopped above a tree in their front lawn(about 120 yards or so from where we were standing)...after hovering there a bit it slowly came down til it got to about 3-4 feet above the ground. Since we started getting so many references it was very clear this &#34;craft&#34; was only 3-3 1/2 feet in diameter. When it came down that low to the ground, its color changed a bit to be a little more white than orange and was softer and less intense. It hovered there behind the branches for must have been an entire 3 or 4 minutes...but it seemed like it was forever. It was like it was just as curious about us as we were of it. Then, the craft began to rise up and change back a bit more towards orange and got about 10 feet above the same tree and it seemed like it began changing shape. At the angle we were at at this point, looking up at it, its background was the sky. So it seemed like this object began changing shape of some sort but really it began flying directly away from us at a very small angle towards more trees. We began to slowly follow it down the road and after 20-25 seconds or so it finally got behind some trees where we could no longer see it. In this area it wasn&#39;t bare maple or oak trees anymore, it was pine trees so it was almost impossible to see it through them. We stopped a little ways before the driveway of the last house and waited for it to pop back out. After maybe 2 minutes it finally crept up above the trees at the end of the road over the trees and someones house heading west-north west. As it disappeared down at the end of the road we looked at each other with our eyes big and mouths open and we took off running towards his house...completely forgetting that the truck was parked in the middle of the road. When we got to the house, just my friends mom was home but she was asleep. We ran in amazed at what we saw, grabbed a bunch of smokes, a pop and ran back to the truck. We wanted to tell the people who were there previously what we saw but at that time everyone had left. We started it up, whipped it around, and took off down the road going North. We got to the end of the road, and began heading west down the road. I was the passenger again and I was watching the sky and fields out my window to see if I could find it. We got about 1/2 mile down the road and took the first gravel road that went north. Both sides of the road were fields for about 1/4 mile, then a thick woods again. As we drove down the road I thought I spotted a light in the woods on the left side, up the road and a little ways in. So we stopped and got out to see if we could see it from a better angle. The light was pretty big, a white center and a red glow much bigger than the previous flying object. We decided we needed to look closer since it just may have been a yard light, very doubtful since it would have to shine brightly through about 100 acres of woods :-) But we had to look closer and see what it was, after all, there was an old cabin back there, maybe someone was occupying it. As we got closer we couldnt see it, and as we got to the woods, we watched out the driver window to see if we could see it. We couldn&#39;t. So we got a ways down the road and turned around, and looked again on the way back. We got back to the fields and turned around and still the light was there in the woods. We drove towards it again to see if we could see it, we couldnt. So we turned around again and came back, doing it 2 more times. But on the last time we were on our way back driving up the hill with woods on both sides of us and the fields 1/8 mile ahead of us. We drove up the hill going kinda slow and there it was. A silverish metallic ball about 3ft in diameter shining off our headlights with three lights on it, all flashing in one by one sync with each other. There was two on top next to each other spaced out and one in the center below those two. Flashing very quick blue-white lights. First the top left would flash on and off, then the top right, then bottom and back to the top left. This pattern was done very very quickly. Probably 4-5 rounds a second. It was on the right side of the road about 4 feet off the ground and you could see perfectly it was self luminous, glowing white a bit. It was maybe 40 yards from us. It was stationary for only about 5-6 seconds, enough time for me to scream to turn the truck around...but he didnt, he seemed eager to drive by it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It then floated over to the left side of the road, by that time we were pretty close, at this time I was so frightened I began letting my head to look downward so I couldn&#39;t see it, and as I did...poof, gone. Even though it was gone I still remember lights being infront of us for some reason...but anyways, we slowly continued to drive down the road going south. We didn&#39;t say a word until we back on the highway going back towards his house. Even then we said very little, a few &#34;no way&#34;&#39;s and a few more simple phrases. When we finally got to his house....we could barely talk about it. It was like there were no words because it didn&#39;t even begin to process yet. The entire experience was just so powerful for us to understand right away. He then decided to goto bed and I took the truck home back to my step dads. That&#39;s where it started to sink in, because I had to haul in somethings to sleep on from a camper we had without a flash light. One by one I hauled in a small matress, a big pile of blankets and pillows in 3 trips. I didn&#39;t want to sleep because I thought I was going to be abducted or something or that I&#39;d look up in the sky and I&#39;d see another craft. I had a negative attitude towards this expierence for awhile, but then I realized it what was obvious. That it was only frightening to us, and they had no intension of scaring us at all. It was just our first expierence with something that isn&#39;t supposed to be real. Once I finally came to terms with it and realized how great and amazing it was, it started to sink in a little that we both had a form of contact with this craft that almost without an any doubt was from another world in my mind. It&#39;s technology seemed so unbelievable. When it would fly and and &#34;jump&#34; over the trees, it seemed to be completely unaffected by force as it were independent from traditional forces like G forces. It&#39;s moves were slow, controlled and flawless. It moved as if forces did not exist at all. It&#39;s pretty obvious that this craft was surrounded by an electromagnetic field. Although I cannot account for the magnetic part, I assume it. The luminosity is a by-product of oxygen/nitrogen? emitting photons caused by the electric field. I do not know if the second craft we saw was the same as the first one. Ever since the sighting I have been into UFO&#39;s. Reading about them quite a bit, researching them and watching for them. Since then I have had another expierence of a craft in which I will be reporting which took place about a month later, during the light of day, above our car as we left the city. Both of these sightings happened during the time when Wisconsin was having all the sightings last year. The way I understand these craft to work...it seemes to be connected to electrogravity theory. Where the craft is made out of key material(zinc/iron alloy as I understand) This craft is then surrounded by a strong electromagnetic field allowing the craft to infact have &#34;poles.&#34; The field is strong and precise enough to where the motion of the charged particles allows the craft to &#34;free&#34; itself from gravity once it reaches a certain point. Many people say &#34;they&#34; cannot come here because the distances are so vast. When at the same time science has a way of explaining it, and I believe this is the way it works. Once the craft is in the previously stated condition, I believe, is no longer affected by force carrying particles outside of the craft. The craft then uses some technique(possibly Element 115, if it&#39;s true that the strong nuclear force can be used for space/time compression) to allow itself to propel towards a wave of gravity that the craft creates itself and allowing it to accelerate to unbelievable speeds instantly. A lot of new research has shown gravity may be faster than light, maybe even constant. The craft may also use a secondary measure when traveling through space. Once it is understood by us, a long time from now, space and time can be bent. And when we understand it enough, we will be able to control and or manipulate it to our advantage for faster-than-light travel in space. I am a computer scientist specializing in the field of security. I also study quantum mechanics and plan on attending college in the field of Nuclear Physics soon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.

10/10/03 23:00|Bickerton (near Wetherby) (UK/England)||Unknown|45minutes|two bright, but fuzzy lights going in a hovering circle about 200 yards of the ground, with a grey cloud above them|10/15/03|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/032/S32235.html|353|ndxe200310| two bright, but fuzzy lights going in a hovering circle about 200 yards of the ground, with a grey cloud above them<n> <n><n> <n><n> At 23:00 I took one of my dogs out into our paddock at the rear of our garden, and walked to the far side of the field. It was a clear night with a full moon. I looked out over the fields, I live in a small village with few street lights. I noticed what looked like lights, not clear lights but fuzzy not more than 100 yards ahead in the sky I think phoforus ( I don&#39;t know how to spell it) is a good way to decribe the lights there where 2 of them going in a large circle chasing each other. After a while they met together for a while then parted and the pattern started over again. I watched this for about half an hour. above the lights was a small cloud funny grey in colour. After about half a hour they suddenly shot of in a northerly direction and disappeared.  I went inside and came out again with the other dog not expecting to see it again when suddenly they came back to the same spot. They continued for about another 10 to 15 minutes and then just shot of again in the same direction. I have not seen them since. Near our village is a small private airport, and small planes are taking of and landing regular, and I am use to seeing the plane lights and this was nothing like that.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
10/10/03 22:00|Albuquerque|NM|Light|3 minutes|Three bright lights that were huddled together than began to seperate and disappeared.|2/1/07|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/054/S54365.html|354|ndxe200310| Three bright lights that were huddled together than began to separate and disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I live in Albuquerque NM and about 3 years ago my wife and I saw something really strange.  I never said anything about my experience except to my close friends.<n> <n><n> <n><n> One night my wife and I were driving home from the Gym.  She was driving and I was looking out the window like I almost always do.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I noticed three very bright lights in the sky.  If I remember correctly they were red, green and purple looking.  It was a very unnatural light.  Very Neon like.  They did not flash or anything like that.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first they were huddled together.  After about a minute of looking at these lights I told my wife to look.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were on a major road in the middle of town.  She saw the lights.  I kept watching the lights and noticed that they were slowly moving away from each other.  One stayed in the original spot where I saw the lights and the other two were drifting oppositely away from the original location.  The two lights that were moving separated a lot.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I told my wife to keep looking at the lights and she did when she could because she was driving.  I kept watching these slow moving lights for about 2 or 3 minutes and then they just disappeared pretty much all at once.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were at the corner of NM 528 and Ellison right near the Wal-mart heading north on 528.<n>
10/10/03 21:10|Crescent Beach|SC|Formation|1 1/2 hr.|For two consecutive nights, we watched a pattern of lights before we were stunned by a discovery on the beach.|1/17/04|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/034/S34166.html|355|ndxe200310| For two consecutive nights, we watched a pattern of lights before we were stunned by a discovery on the beach.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am the pastor and director of a Christian outreach ministry. My wife is an administrator, my mother is a retired nursing supervisor, my four children range in age from 20 to fourteen. We witnessed first one light in the sky, from our perspective, to the right of the moon, high over the ocean horizon. It started as a small light and continued to increase in intensity until it appeared as a very bright, directional light. Yet it had know strobe or movement. The lumination continued for approximately 10 sec. and then slowly faded at the same point in the sky. It was a clear night. Almost immediately, another light, in another point of the sky to our east slowly came on and increased in intensity in the exact same manner without movement. Then, two lights, simultainously came on in different parts of the sky, then, together, they went out after approximately 10 sec. Then six lights came on in a pattern, one after another, again, no strobe, no movement, all over the ocean horizon, high enough to be considered air born. They all stayed on for approximatlely 10 sec. and then together, slowly faded out. This continue for one and a half hours and was witnessed by the entire family.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I did not report the experience to officials. Others walking on the beach were noted to stop and point.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The exact same thing happened again the following night, at the same time and in the same manner.<n> <n><n> <n><n> One more very odd thing, I took my three sons kyaking on Friday of that week. We went out in the intercoastal waterway and made our way out to the ocean. We headed north, across the inlet from Cherry Grove, SC. The island we were alongside is deserted. We were going to explore the island. We saw a large group of people approximately 1/2 mile up the beach, walking around as if to be looking for beach treasures. An odd note, from our perspective, they were all wearing long sleeve dark shirts and long pants. Strange for that time of year. We decided we would continue toward them to see what they were looking for. As we continued to approach, we witnessed the large group form a circle, as if they were looking at something that had washed up on the beach. We continued to paddle against the surf to reach them. We looked at each other long enough to consider what the group must be doing. When we looked back in the direction of the group on the beach, they were gone. No sign of anyone. We continued to paddle until we reached the supposed area of the beach combers. We beached our kyaks and began looking for evidence of the group. There were no footprints or trace of anyone, much less a group of fifty. We checked the dunes and looked for boats on the other side, which we could see from the dunes. Everyone was gone. Then, I saw one man walking toward us from the north. He was aproximately 2/10 mile away. I walked toward him to ask if he had seen anyone. He approached and was an old man wearing only underwear. He was carrying a metal bucket which I did not look in. I asked if he had seen anyone else. He said he thought we were with the group. He said he they were part of a group of people that own the private island and that they were doing scientific expiriments. Now answering any more or my questions, he continued to walk south and we never saw him again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am perplexed by the events of our vacation and have written it off as unexplained.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
10/10/03 20:25|Temperance|MI|Oval|over 5 hours|pulsating green white and red object in the northwest sky at 45degrees|10/31/03|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/032/S32421.html|356|ndxe200310| pulsating green white and red object in the northwest sky at 45 degrees<n> <n><n> <n><n> I went jogging like i do so many nights. Immediatly i noticed straight ahead a &#34;star&#34; that was emitting colors. So i decided to watch it to see if it was a plane or whatever. It never moved but i could clearly see green white and red rotating or pulsating. A man walking his dog came up and asked what i was looking at so i pointed. He immediatly said &#34;strange&#34;. I asked what he was seeing and he said the same thing-christmas colors. We watched for 10 min. or so and decided it wasnt moving but wasnt a star or plane also. I ran back and got my 8x hunting binn to get a better look. Wow!!! You could look at mars,stars but when you looked at this it just sparkled colors. My neighbor came out to smoke a cigg and saw me outside. He looked too and couldnt believe it when i told him it hasnt moved in a half hour. Next his wife was looking both saying they saw green white and red too. He went back and got his binn. 10x -still couldnt make out a shape-oval to egg shaped maybe. By now there were more people outside looking because of warm weather they heard voices outside and wanted to see what was going on. A hunter went in and got another pair of binn. to get a better look. Everyone agreed on what colors we were seeing. People watched for 45 min or so and went inside. I stayed outside and wouldnt take my eyes off it. Soon another pulsating object exactly the same came to it and got about a dimes width  apart with your hand extended out. It soon kind of floated down below the original one and they now started moving slowly to the northeast together. The 2nd one kind of faded back to where it came from and the original now started moving. It now was holding in the northeast sky but higher up and acting funny. The neighbor across from me came back out and said it was gone but i showed her how far it had moved across the sky. We both watched for about 45min.-colors still evident but higher up and now its kind of &#34;dancing&#34;. It would buzz up and down /right left. I called up my son that i wanted him to see this. When i got to his house we positioned ourselves so the light was in the phone lines for reference. It moved upward slowly but zig zaggy.I left at midnight(work) and my boy continued watching till 1:50 am. He said at the highest point he swears he saw another light come out of it thru his binn but couldnt be sure. He said dad the light just vanished!! Since this incident I have found out the &#34;hunters&#34; dad got out his telescope on his back deck and watched for over 45 min.-said in years of having telescope never looked at anything like this. I took 3 pictures but dont expect anything with a 35mm camera pointing at the sky and the flash blub going off. I have also re-interviewd about 3/4 of the witnesses since this happened.<n>
10/10/03 20:05|Grand View|ID|Light|12-15 seconds|Bright light above Mt. Home AFB|10/15/03|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/032/S32194.html|357|ndxe200310| Bright light above Mt. Home AFB<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was outside preparing a fire for guests to sit around for my sister&#39;s birthday gathering. I noticed a bright white star-like object moving through the trees above me, roughly 45 degrees above the horizon, moving from SouthEast to NorthEast in what looked like the sky above Mountain Home Airforce Base. I backed out from under the trees to get a better look. It was as bright as Mars is at first, in fact at first I thought it was Mars, and as it moved it increased in brightness about 4 or 5 times its initial brightness, or magnitude, then turned sharply, roughly 75 degrees from the plane of the horizon, and proceeded up through the constellation Cassiopeia, dimming as it disappeared in the distance. The entire event lasted approximately 12 to 15 seconds. Living as close as we do to Mt. Home AFB, I am quite familiar with aircraft lights and configuration, and this exhibited none that I am familiar with. We are about 8 miles from the airbase as the crow flies, and even at that distance one can discern the noise of the various jet aircraft stationed there while in flight. This object emitted no sound. It left no trail or contrail. And Mars was still there, so it wasn&#39;t Mars. Nor have I observed any aircraft performing a maneuver of this nature living as I have this close to an airbase.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Traffic was backed up and parking was a nightmare so we were driving very slow.      My stepson and I saw the object hovering above a housing development located at Union Mill Road and Sequoia Lea Road - across the street from Centreville High School.  (my husband did not see it   he was concentrating on the road)   The object was hovering very low, around 500 feet and was motionless and silent for the majority of the viewing.    The object was arranged in a 3-spoke type configuration much like a Mercedes Benz symbol and the spokes appeared to be in equal distance from one another.   Each of the three spokes was completely lined with white lights and in the middle of the spokes was a red light.   The lights were constantly on while the object was still.    The object was very large.    It appeared to be much larger than the homes it was hovering over.     We drove past the object, but in our hunt for a parking spot passed back by the sighting spot twice.   After driving past the object was obscured by trees.    After turning around and heading back towards the site the first time, my stepson and I both saw the object rising up and the white lights were cycling off and on in a pattern around the object (like the lights were chasing one another) and the red light was also blinking.     After turning around and heading back towards the site, the object was not visible.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We have inquired of the witness whether the lights might have been from an advertising display, but we have not heard back from the party.  PD))<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((FOLLOW-UP COMMUNICATION FROM WITNESS))<n> <n><n> <n><n> No, my incident was not an advertising campaign.    One, there are no businesses anywhere within about 3/4 mile from where the sighting occured.<n> <n><n> The sighting was over a rather large subdivision, and I have yet to see someone put sky beams in their yard!   There was definitely something above those houses.   I thought you would be interested, but I see that you are not.    That&#39;s fine.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((END))<n>

First thought it was an airplane, but the flashing lights were more like camera light bulbs going off all at once and not just normal blinking lights you see on an airplane, Lights were bright white flashes, with no color. Looked like it was headed in a southerly direction but remained in the same location for long periods of time... lasted until trees obscured my view. I had a gut-feeling this was not a &#34;normal&#34; type of craft for some reason... hearing more and more people making comments also about seeing odd crafts in the sky lately... not sure what is going on.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I just thought it was really strange all the same. I saw three black ovals in the sky. Hanging from them was one movie camera. One of those big professional reporter sized cameras. The camera was looking around all by it self. No one was in sight. It was no higher in the sky than a two story building. After about two minutes it slowly took off east into the sky and then turned south. I couldn&#39;t see any supporting cables. Thats what made it really weird! And the black ovals were REALLY BLACK! The sharpest, clearest, brightest BLACK you have ever seen! The street it was hovering over was Vally Blvd and Garfield in Alhambra CA 91801.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Of course there are no such things as UFO&#39;s. I think it was just some hollywood guys checking out the city for sites to film. The funny thing is. I could NOT hear any helicopter noises comeing from the ovals. Nothing, nada. Weird huh?<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

It moved at high speeds that no other craft could do. It would not blink and there were no other signs of light on the craft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It change it&#39;s direction suddenly and go the complete opposite direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We kept watching this until it stopped. Then it vanished like the other craft.<n>

We were looking up at the sky, basically because it&#39;s so dark there and the stars are so bright.  Suddenly, out of the west, three disk shaped bright red objects entered the western horizon and within five seconds they spanned the entire sky into the eastern horizon.  They flew in a staggered formation at an extremely high altitude.  I&#39;m very familiar with all military jets, especially stealth aircraft and I&#39;ve never seen anything like this.  I&#39;m 53 and have served two tours of duty in Vietnam as a Civil Affairs Specialist.  I presently am the CEO and Administrator of a ((medical)) facility in Sidney, Ohio.

I looked down to step forward and when I looked back up my eyes focused on a rather bright star - next to where the satellite had just passed.  My partner did not stop looking up.  As my eyes found the satellite, we both saw it turn red and it looked like it shot straight out - towards space, then disappeared.  It happened really fast, like, a second or two.   We watched the sky for another couple of minutes – thinking it would reappear – but it did not.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Planes come by our way frequently as we are almost beneath the flight path for Ames Research/Moffett Field.  Shortly (within about 30 seconds) after the satellite disappeared there was one such flight coming into Moffett.  I don’t know if this came from the Moffett plane, but a contrail floated across the sky – visible to our eyes – roughly in the same path that the satellite had been going (we think it strange but probably not connected).  Perhaps it was the exhaust from the Moffett plane.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Perhaps you will have others reporting about this in the Bay Area and we aren’t the only ones who saw this.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thank you to the witness for the report.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Brian Vike, Director HBCC UFO Research Canadian Toll Free UFO Hotline 1 866 262 1989 - Free call.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Home - Phone/Fax 1 250 845 2189 HBCC UFO Forum Board http://216.147.50.102/HBCC-UFO/index.php email: hbccufo@telus.net Website: http://www3.telus.net/public/wilbur8/hbcc_ufo_research.htm<n>

As it circled overhead I noticed what appeared to be a star 50 to 60 degrees above the horizon behind the airplane.  I first thought it might be a balloon as the local automobile dealerships use allot of them.  I noticed that it was not moving with the wind, which were 15 to 20 mph.  I then observed the object through 12X50 Bushnell binoculars.  Through binoculars the object resembled highly polished aluminum.  I then thought it was perhaps a milar balloon and continued to observe it.  It then rotated slowly in a clockwise direction to reveal that it was oblong.  It was shaped like a cylindar bisected lengthwise, slightly flared at the bottom edges.  I thought it might be a helicopter at high altitude but there were no rotors visible. While I was observing it it disappeared instantly. Weather was moderate winds and partly cloudy.

Four witnesses who were near the Driftwood fossil beds just outside of Smithers British Colombia watched a strange looking object for approx: 10 minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object was described as being very flat (almost looking like a wing of an aircraft), silver in color and very long. It appears the sun was reflecting off it, as it was shinning very brightly. One of the witnesses described the tips of the object as being like a jet&#39;s wing tips, slightly bent upwards. The witnesses told me the object stayed stationary in one spot, but from time to time it did move from side to side. The fellows also noted that there was a line of red lights running along the object. The folks watched the lights move from the tips of it into the center of the object then disappear. The red lights continued the same pattern over and over again while it sat stationary.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As the object was leaving the area where it was first located, it grew smaller and smaller due to it moving into the  distance. But before they lost sight of it,  they noticed that it started growing in size, and all the witnesses said it grew some 3 to 4 times larger then just vanished. In other words it just blinked out.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thank you to the witness for the report.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Brian Vike, Director HBCC UFO Research Canadian Toll Free UFO Hotline 1 866 262 1989 - Free call.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Home - Phone/Fax 1 250 845 2189 HBCC UFO Forum Board http://216.147.50.102/HBCC-UFO/index.php email: hbccufo@telus.net Website: http://www3.telus.net/public/wilbur8/hbcc_ufo_research.htm<n>

At first, I thought that it was a banner being pulled by a plane, but it was moving way too slow.  Then, I thought that it was a heliocopter, and that my eyes just weren&#39;t focused into the actual shape.  But as I got closer, it became evident that the object was definitely rectangular.  I couldn&#39;t make out the color because I was still at least 5 miles away from it as it moved slowly across the expressway in an Southernly direction.  I was really tempted to drive further down the expressway to get a better look, but unfortunately, I had to go to work :(  The object appeared to be at least 1000 feet up or so, and was too big to be a heliocopter; and it moved very slowly, if at all as if it were just hovering.  I&#39;m not saying that it was a UFO, but I know that I would have recognized the craft if it was anything familar like a plane or chopper.  I just want to know what it was.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I just returned home last night and am now filing a siting report.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was outside on our second story porch having a cigarette. Looking northeast, fairly high in the sky, I was distracted by quick movements of an object lower in the sky. I tend to have my camera always nearby, but since I was packing for a trip, I happened to have it, extra battaries, a memory card, etc. in a case in the pocket of my robe! I quickly pulled it out, turned it on, held it up facing the area in the sky where I had detected movement, took a flash picture, and got the enclosed image. The image I previously emailed you (the night of the event), is the exact same image zoomed and cropped.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I was looking around like I usually do at night in hopes that I can see...something new. I noticed a light far off in the distance. It appeared to be right above a mountain peak ( which I have not yet determined the mountain) which was between Ft. Carson and the closest mountain by Hwy. 24 headed west. At first I thought it was just a star...but when I looked back no more than 1 minutes later, it had descended towards the top of the mountain...slowly but YES, it had moved. I thought not to much of it Yet... I continued my &#34;gazing&#34; around the sky. The next time I turned and looked at my &#34;star&#34; it was gone. I assume it either &#34;landed&#34; or impacted the mountain, or simply gone behind it. While this could have been a star, I have never noticed a &#34;star&#34; to move that distance in such a short time... I cant explain it...nor can I explain the fire balls me and my friend have seen near Ft. Carson before either... Thats another sighting though...<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I looked up in the sky and told my friend as a joke that &#34;what if a UFO would come from those clouds and pointed at those clouds moving towards us and started to move my hands from the clouds towards ourselves. Just as I was saying that my friends shouted &#34;LOOK A UFO&#34; and we both saw a circle shaped flying object just where I was pointing, coming out of nowhere with great speed with first a bright aura white light that later turned red midway in air, the craft then slowed than from it´s incredible speed and then just vanished in the clear sky. We where shocked and started to figure out every possible explanation to what we had just wittnessed, we told eachother that it could have been a metroid (sp?) or a starfall although it was much closer and could both slow down and accelerate. It clearly felt that they where listening to our conversation since they showed up just as we where talking about them. Just to see if if we possibly where right that they could hear us I turned up to the sky and said that &#34;if you really heard what we said and wanted to show us that you exist, then please I beg you, show yourselves one more time so that we can be sure&#34;. We kept looking at the stars a couple of minutes as another one appeared in the sky above us flying with great speed leaving a yello trail after itself and then dissapearing as well. As soon as it appeared I yelled &#34;LOOK ANOTHER ONE&#34; and my friends said &#34;YES YES I SEE IT, I SEE IT&#34;. The other one was not as close to us as the first was as the first one was flying at cloud level and the other clearly above but still very visible. They appeared in diffrent locations in the sky and diffrent heights. We are 100% certain that they where not airplanes or anything natural, they where flying objects and they seemed to communicate with us just by showin themselves in the sky as we talked about them and with them. Had it only happened once we would probably have tried to find a &#34;normal! &#34; explanation and would have later forgot about it (although we where both certain enought the 1st time as we both saw the same thing) but since the other one appeared as well just about 5min after the 1st one, there was no longer any doubt for me or my friend!<n>

Whatever I saw, it was pretty big. I&#39;d say atleast five times the size of any light beacons on the towers near my home. It traveled from NE to SW at a very high speed, was a very light fluorescent blue in color, and left a trail behind it. I&#39;m not sure how long it was actually visible because there were some trees obstructing my view. I may have just seen the tail end of this objects flight path. The night sky was extremely clear and I also noticed alot more air traffic than usual. I want to say the tip of it was rounded, almost like a roundnose pistol bullet. I&#39;m pretty sure it wasn&#39;t a meteor. I am not an expert on these things, but I can definitely say I&#39;ve never seen anything like this before.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Clear skies, Both of us noticed (at basically the same time) an extremely bright white light that appeared to move away at an alarming rate of speed.  The light was as big as your pinky finger nail when held at arms length, and appeared to be 20-30 degrees from the horizon and several miles away.  At no time did the light move up, down, or side to side, rather it appeared to be stationary and then slowly faded from bright white to darkness ... the entire process took about 10 seconds... like someone tuned a dimmer switch. (or like it was moving away at an alarming speed)  Initial observation of the light was that it was similar to landing lights on the front of an airplane, however, there was only one light and appeared much brighter than landing lights I have seen before.  Additionally, there were no other visible lights within the vicinity of the single white light.  Both during the time we saw the white light, and in the minutes that followed as we looked for any signs of plane or such in that area.  If it had been a plane, it simply would not have disappeared that fast as the other aircraft in the sky were plainly visible long after.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The light appeared due north from Highway 19, approx 20-30 degrees from the horizon, and appeared to be 4-6 miles away (the distance was based on my observation of two aircraft in the sky at the same time, to the east and west of the bright light, and moving in a northeast, and northwest direction)  Even though the other aircraft in the sky were at some distance and moving away from us as well, they were clearly visible for 5 minutes or so after the Bright White light faded.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There were no sounds heard at or around the time of the Bright White light<n>

When we both got out of our trucks, we both immediately looked up to the South West sky and couldn’t believe what we were seeing. We immediately ran towards the open fields out back to get a better look and we saw a bright light, bright as a star, moving west to east across the mountain ridgeline with what looked like two aircraft following it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The light began to move erratically and then disappeared like in a second’s time. The two aircraft, which I can’t really call them jets, continued East bound and then both turned and went up in elevation and began to head north right over us. As me and w#2 were looking at the aircraft coming towards us, we had the most weirdest feeling that something is going on ....verrry strange.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The two aircraft had lights on them and the one to the right had a more common look to it. The aircraft on the left was larger and had more lights of which many were on and different colors. They seemed to be changing position throughout the pass over. As the aircrafts came directly over us, we noticed that first of all, everything was silent and as we watched them the one on the left seemed to have a reddish glow in front of it and it was hard to stay focused on because it appeared to be changing shapes or something. It, to me, had a mutli shape to it something like the Star Trek Enterprise. w#2 said it looked like a shape of a stingray. Just as the aircraft passed by over us at a very slow pace, we noticed that the aircraft on the right had somehow disappeared and the strange looking one on the left, began to change it’s lights and the back of it had two bright lights that began to move in towards each other and then began moving apart and moved apart enough that the shape of the craft seemed to have changed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were amazed that we heard absolutely nothing! Not even noises of vehicles or anything. It was very tranquil as if we were in a dream or something. At this point, 7:41 pm, I made a phone call and w#3 was alerted. Me and w#2 then were saying to each other, “I can’t believe this just happened“. Then a moment later, the bright light appeared almost right over us, much closer this time and we held upon to each other’s shirts and watched this light, that was still for a moment, while saying over and over again, “Oh My God, Oh My God,“ The bright object then began to make a few moves and then it began to travel from West to East and simply disappeared. W#3 immediately looked outside and apparently he witnessed the one aircraft and observed that it did not look like a jet, while moments later, he witnessed the bright light travel fast from West to East. He then came down with an instant severe head ache. Myself and w#2 did not experience any type of headache.<n> <n><n> <n><n> While we were looking to the East basically at Mars and the almost full moon, we were just so numb to as what just happened and then we noticed an enormous amount of air traffic in all directions in the sky. We both said, where did all these come from? Then a moment later, while looking back at the moon, a jet comes from the Northeast heading Southwest and left a fat lingering contrail right in the path of the moon. I immediately said, “Now, with all the strange stuff that just happened, what the heck is the reason for that?”  Then at around 8pm the skies were back to normal with no air traffic. The entire event lasted maybe about 30 minutes of which me and w#2 both left of our doors to the trucks open out in the driveway and they were both dinging the whole time. Even though it lasted almost thirty minutes, the entire time felt like no more than two minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This event prompted me to write about it to the Conway Daily Sun with contact numbers and email and my letter appeared in Friday’s edition. I have since received approximately 12 phone messages, 8 emails, and 3 actual phone conversations.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Apparently, we had a similar event take place the next night, on Thursday, when apparently the aircraft that was tracking this light or fireball, tried to keep up with it, from which possibly they caused two different sonic booms and many people then, thought something is very wrong.<n> <n><n> <n><n> these are just some of the eyewitness’s without knowing my story  One woman called me Friday morning from Effingham and said she was out for a walk and she saw what looked like a fireball or something go screaming by West to East and then moments later two jets heading in the same direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had reports from a man in Woonsocket village in West Ossipee about a sonic boom he heard and then another one shortly after, then as he went outside to look if he could see anything, he didn’t, but he heard jet engines for about two minutes or so.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A women in Edelweiss about a boom that “rocked her house“, she thought “this is it, were going”.<n> <n><n> <n><n> She was told by her association that it was probably a sonic boom that happens occasionally here  She did hear other booms about 20 minutes later but they were off in a distance.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had another man from Madison tell me that he heard just a massive explosion that shook his well built house and all was quiet with no sirens or any sign of an emergency. He didn’t know what happened..<n> <n><n> <n><n> I then had a women who was walking near the high school and said, “she saw two air craft. One had it’s normal flashing lights, and right above it, there was another something flying, had maybe two or three lights and it was maybe a little ways ahead of the plane, it was pretty strange and I wasn’t sure that I was seeing things myself.”  A man from Bartlett asked me if it was a light moving against all laws of physics?  Another Bartlett man saw the light and looked away for a second or so, and it was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A man from Berlin had a bad dream Wed. night that his house was visited by a UFO and now he is just curious what did happen down in our neck of the woods... He’s never had anything like that happen to him before. He’s not a reporter but he would like to know what went on. He believes that stuff like that can happen .<n> <n><n> <n><n> A women in North Conway saw the event  A women from Chatham saw it, but wouldn’t tell me until I told her.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Another women and four other fellow workers in North Conway who witnessed a silvery strange looking thing over the Moat Mountains.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I don&#39;t know if this is what u saw but this is what my friend and I saw from The Vista in Inter vale that night and it was probably a little later then 7:30...closer to 9:30 till maybe 10... My friend and I work in retail and we usually go to the Vista after work and talk and relax...We are there quite a bit and have seen some interesting events should I call them in the skies over Bartlett and surrounding areas.......but Wednesday night was totally different.....There seem to be as we were sitting in my friends vehicle that above the mtns straight ahead of us and above was an object that &#34;hovered&#34; for a very long time it flashed colored lights and seemed from the distance that we were seeing it go in a track not in circles but like a square or rectangle. and it would do much like a hover-craft bob up and down but all of a sudden we saw flashes of ground light from behind the mtns or seemed to be anyway. We must have watched that thing for a good 15 min just doing what it was doing and then it began to descend behind the mtns and it dropped quickly and then totally disappeared out range...My friend and I left quite perplexed...because we had never seen anything like that before......not at the Vista anyway...and that leads me to another part of this.....my friend and her brother watched something from her window Thursday night...she said she saw a plane a jet and it seemed to be chasing a &#34;light&#34; in the sky far ahead of it...the light would appear and disappear it seemed to be going at a tremendous rate of speed....she said there were two Sonic booms that shook her house and everything in it! And she wanted to know if any one else had reported that BOOM! She lives in Madison,NH........Please email me back I would love to know what u saw...and if she and I witnessed anything like you and yours did? I was so excited to see someone had seen something that I couldn&#39;t believe ....... My  daughter told me that you have seen things in the sky before and if you say you did you probably did! I have no doubt in my mind of that!  Have a great day and keep in touch with me please we could compare notes I am sure.........<n> <n><n> <n><n> A fellow believer,  Hi, I saw your letter in the paper regarding strange events in the sky  Wednesday evening. Well, what my daughter and I saw was before sunset  and it  was in the west, northwest sky and not a cloud in the sky except for  this  very strange, almost looked like a crescent shaped cloud, but it was  very  odd looking and both my daughter and I were like, What the heck is  that? It  was driving us nuts. We were on our way to Hannaford&#39;s to do some  shopping  and when we came out it was dark and we could not find the object  again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Although, I think my daughter said she saw it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Hello,  I am sending this email in response to your letter sent in to the  Conway Daily Sun. Something....odd seemed to happen last night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was around 7:45-8:00, when we heard a large crash that shook  the house. It almost seemed the window in the living room was  going to fall out of place. We had no idea what happened, so we  ran to get flashlights and ran outside.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Immediately we heard a plane, but it seemed closer then usual. We  looked up and saw a moving light, we presumed a plane. So we went  around the property, looking for whatever happened. You&#39;d think it  wouldn&#39;t be that big of a deal normally. Except the shockwave was  so sudden and intense we both seemed to have a bad feeling about  it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We didn&#39;t find anything, but a few strange occurrences happened.<n> <n><n> <n><n> First of all, we live in Madison, and the most air traffic we get  is 1 plane a week. Last night we heard, at least, 4 air planes in  less then an hour. One of which was like one we had never seen  before. It had 2 very rapid flashing lights that flashed from the  wing and belly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Also, one of my our friends also heard the same thing. They seemed  to experience the &#39;Shockwave&#39; that rattled the windows, but  nothing else.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Finally, one of our friends that live in Conway experienced  nothing, so it seems very &#39;centralized&#39; to where we are.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We don&#39;t think it could be an earthquake, as it felt more like an  impact. Not sure if has anything to do with your sighting, but  it&#39;s too coincidental to ignore. Perhaps they are connected.<n> <n><n> <n><n> If you think there IS some connection, let us know.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thanks    &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;  3 of us saw this light show...it was fun to watch see ya around the town<n>

Please note that there are 2 other sightings reported that night near me...one in Bel Air, MD  and one in Rising Sun, MD...(That is the direction I was looking while watching the ufo.) Also,  there is a body of water between Kennedyville ( me ) and Bel Air or Rising Sun There are really no other sightings in MD in October that I could find on your sight except for that night at the times the 3 separate reporters reported our sightings. Those times are very close together.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There is one exception near Annapolis MD......<n> <n><n> <n><n> I would like to hear from the others who had sightings in Bel Air and Rising Sun that evening.

Next, a large ball of orangish light appeared and 2 lights broke off into a horizontal formation.  They faded out again.  This went on for almost an hour.  Sometimes the ball would break off into a vertical formation while other times into a horizontal or diagonal formation. It would only stay visible for 5-6 seconds at a time.  The last 10 minutes were the most active. It broke off into a formation of 4 from the main ball of light ( all perfectly spaced ).  Then when it re-appeared it broke off into a formation of 5 lights.  And finally into a vertical formation of 6 equally spaced lights.  The main light would never moved once it appeared. Once each ball of light went to it&#39;s place in the formation, the formation stayed still for 5-6 seconds and then would fade out all at the same time. My wife went next door to tell our neighbors.  When the neighbors came out to see,  the craft(s) never revealed themselves again.  I have never seen anything like this before and neither has my wife.  The lights seemed to be no more than 1000 feet from the ground ( sometimes just above the tree line ).<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We suspect the witness may have observed celestial bodies.

I&#39;m guessing I observed it for approximately 20-25 seconds as I stood still and watched to see if it became visable again. It didn&#39;t. I returned to the house to write down the sighting and went back outside to observe the moon and Mars as it&#39;s a gorgeous quiet night. The object was approximately 25-30 degrees from the eastern horizon.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

No sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We saw a cluster of lights flashing in the distance. It seemed to be stationary. We were driving east bound on Rt. 273.  Thought it may be a hellicopter, but as soon as we decided it was probably a hellicopter, suddenly there was a bright head light.  It started coming toward us as we were still driving.  It was heading west down Rt 273.  It was going at a slow speed and seemed to be getting lower.  Maybe the height of 1 1/2 telephone poles.  I got the feeling that it may hit us.  All we saw at this point was the head light coming right to us.  It finally flew over us.  We got a look under it.  I didn&#39;t see any landing gear.  It was light gray or white.  The shape was a rounded rectangle.  My son described it as being more rounded.  He got the best look at it and said that it was something he had never seen before.  There was NO sound either.  Which was something we didn&#39;t realize until a few minutes later.  I called the  Rising Sun Police department when we got home to see if any one else had reported anything strange.  The person I talked to said that she saw a cluster of lights and thought it was just a plane.  It wasn&#39;t plane lights.  There were too many lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Previous experience had taught me not to get mesmerized!!<n> <n><n> <n><n> I awoke at 3:30a.m. I sat up and lit a cigarette and I noticed a peculiar light reflecting on some furniture across from me. I recall thinking, that this was odd, because, there was no beam coming through the window. Just a dull vertical light reflecting on an upright cabinet. I finished my cigarette and lay down, once again. Then I heard a faint, electrical crackling sound. I arose, and went to the window. I dept my hand on the shade pull, because in 1991, while living in an adjacent town in an apartment situated on the perimeter, of the state forest I had experienced two traumatic experiences, which have left an indlible mind imprint. This, is why I approached the window in a cautionary manner. This, is the reason why I grasped the shade pull fully exposing myself, fully at the window to whatever, may be outside. i am glad that I made this descret maneuver, for above the next door house was a large, rectangular shape. It was a very, bright, very white glowing object. It gave the appearance of being created from New England milk glass, which was popular in these parts, during the 19th century. I got the distinct impression that this glowing object was very weighty. I am not good with eyeballing measurement, but I think that it was about the size of two, large, sized kitchen stoves placed side by side. The object was very still...not moving a hair...just sitting there hovering, above my neighbor&#39;s house.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous.  PD))<n>

The pattern then changed to a v formation moving northwest very slowly.I went around my house to follow the lights and my neighbors parents were in the driveway unpacking their car.I asked the gentleman if he observed the lights also. He confirmed them and was as puzzled as I to what it could be.There was no sound associated with them. They continued Northwest in movement and we lost sight of them because of trees.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was nearly dark and the full moon was behind me.  I looked up, noticing a bright star and wondered if it were Mars. Then I saw a white blinking light high overhead which I assumed was a plane, traveling northward. Then another blinking light caught my eye, quite a bit lower than the first.  Almost immediately I saw that this second light was accompanied by 5 or 6 more. They were all blinking, moving fairly quickly off to the west. They resembled a group of fireflies, yet their movements and the blinking seemed co-ordinated, not random, and they appeared to remain equidistant from one another.  Before I could discern a pattern or definite shape to the formation, it disappeared behind the trees on the horizon. I heard no sound. I&#39;ve watched meteor showers before, and as a child once saw a spectacular auroral display, but have never experienced a UFO sighting. Whatever this was, it was a lovely sight...<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The objects color was silver.  The tecture of the mechanical object seemed to be similar to a brushed aluminum.  I was about 20 to 30 feet from it at my eye level on the 7th floor of the apartment building that I live in.  It seemed to be about 3to 5 feet across at the bottom. It caught my eye outside my patio so I went to investigate.  I stood there and watched it travel (like it was floating) horizontally right in front of me.  When it noticed me the  flat side of the pyramid rotated on its axis and faced me.  I remember a flash of light that came from the center of the object.  I watched it pick up speed and travel N.  At this point I went inside to tell someone to step outside and look at this thing in the sky.

It was moving very slowly, and appeared to stop for brief periods of time.  It was an Oval/disk shape and had an aura of bright white light around it, that occasionally shot of short beams of white light.  It was a totally clear day, blue sky, with absolutely no other aircraft, or clouds in the sky.  It also seemed to appear,disappear, then reappear, becoming dark, and then brilliant light and aura. It took me several minutes to figure out what was going on, then I ran and got my camera.  But the camera didn&#39;t have a card in it! So I had to go back, get a card out of the package, turn camera off and on, and then go back and refocus-this process took me about 7 minutes.  When I took the photo the object was further away, and I had to wait in between it&#39;s disappearing and appearing. I managed to get 4 consecutive photos, and sometimes when it reappeared it seemed closer and then further away. I sit on my deck quite a lot, and I&#39;ve seen a lot of aircraft,blimps, etc.  But this object was very unusual.  I hope the photos are good enough to be magnified and analyzed, allowing identification of this object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

There was a lighted dome in the center. The craft was moving slowly from SE to NNW at about 5,000 feet. Over the Franklin Mountains, this area is just east of Ft. Bliss and slightly southwest of White Sands Missle Range.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have a background in science, masters degree, and work at one of the military installations, I am familiar with many types of aircraft. This was very different. From observing the crafts speed, size, etc. I would say it traveling just slightly faster than stall speed, the craft was more or less 300 feet lateral and 100 feet front to back. Both of us are trained scientists working in our disiplines, there is no question about what we observed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We have received several similar reports from this area in the recent past.  We wonder whether the object may be a high-altitude, helium-filled research balloon.  PD))<n>

Neither craft were emitting any lights. Their color was dull metallic grey with a dark tint, the sun was reflective off their hulls. The size of the crafts was somewhat smaller than a USAF/USMC C130 transport aircraft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Location: Gulf of Mexico; 20 nautical miles west of the Egmont Key entrance to Tampa Bay.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We (two adults) were sailing back to Tampa from a deep Gulf run. From a distance of 2 miles we noted a tanker heading east towards Tampa Bay. The seas were calm and the sky only slightly cloudy. Directly behind or astern of the tanker were the two crafts. They were an estimated 500 yards behind and an estimated 1,000 feet above the tanker. The crafts, flying somewhat in formation, one slightly ahead of the other, decended until they were no more than 200 feet above the water, and as they decended they altered course, moving in our direction. I changed course so as to prevent the sails from blocking our view of them and as I did so the crafts begin to gain altitude and move off in a westernly direction. Their speed was an estimated 150 knots while in the area and continually increasing while leaving the area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am very familiar with Military and civilian aircraft and could not identify either craft.Neither craft, seen very clearly through binoculars, displayed any semblence of a wing assembly, a tail section or visible engines. Neither craft displayed navigation lights, tail identification numbers, wings or a tail assembly; they were oval in shape with the &#39;forward&#39; section somewhat smaller in height to the &#39;tail&#39;.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
10/7/03 01:30|Perth (Western Australia)||Triangle|1 second|1 mile away on the other side of the Canning River at 1:30am|10/31/03|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/032/S32717.html|404|ndxe200310| 1 mile away on the other side of the Canning River at 1:30am<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was talking with my friend one Saturday night on his balcony overlooking the Canning River in Perth, Western Australia. I was sitting on a chair with my bach to the wall, while I was facing the view which happened to be the night sky with the river below. My friend was facing me, that is why he didn&#39;t see it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A few degrees above my line of sight, the UFO apeared. I guess it was about a 1 mile away directly infront of me. As soon as it appeared it shot in a curve to the right and slightly up and vanished. I believe I saw it from behind. It moved incredible fast and with no sound. It wasn&#39;t just some ball of light, it was quite detailed, as I said before, I think I saw it&#39;s behind, which to me was a dimond shape but I think it would have been a triangle if I had seen a top profial. On the 2 wing extremes of the UFO were 2 large white lights which made me think of the Lockhead Blackbirds jets, but the lights weren&#39;t blinding. In the middle of the object was a dull red colour. I estimate the UFO was about 15m wide and 4m tall, I couldn&#39;t see how long it was.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The Perth flight paths are over my house and were I saw the UFO. My friends house also shows from its balcony a side on view the planes decending to Perth International and Domestic Airports a few km&#39;s away. You can also see the head lights of the planes from the eastcoast comming from the horizon over the Darling ranges in the east of Perth until they get closer and closer and then bank to a side on view for their decent to the Airport. I say all this because I am completly familiar with the air traffic around Perth, what it looks like day and night, the speeds they can go, their movability and the sound all the different aircraft make. You can easily hear a passenger Jet 1 mile away as well as a lier Jet, What I saw made no sound, even at the impossible speed it moved.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My friend stopped talking and had to ask what I was looking at, a was lost for words, I never said it was Aliens but to me it is still a UFO (because I have no Idea what it was). I must admit my reaction was a lot more low key then I would have thought I&#39;d have. The sight didn&#39;t frighten me at all, and I&#39;m astonished at the fact that it has made very little impact on me at all, maybe its my way of pretending it didn&#39;t happen, I can&#39;t explain it so I&#39;vce ignored it up until now.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The light bent on the object as if it were curved or raindropped shape, and as if the object was spinning or turning. When the light got from one side to the other, the back side of the object was facing me and as it did, the object dimmed and shot at LEAST 20 miles across the sky and disappeared...... It was a crystal clear night, so it didn&#39;t disappear into any clouds.... I instantly called my house to tell my fiance what I saw, as soon as I began to say hello, the weirdest noise shot through my cell, she told me she heard it on her phone too.  I was only 1 mile from home. The noise sounded like radio frequency, but was only a second long.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with this witness via telephone, and found him to be quite credible.  He felt quite certain that the sighting had not been caused by an observation of an advertising light streaking across the sky.  Conditions were clear, with no clouds.  PD))<n>

While there, I became fascinated with UFOs, for a number of reasons.  The most signifacant thing that turned me into a believer was an actual sighting.  I remember it perfectly:  It was about 8:30 pm and I was watching TV in my bonus room.  When the commercial came on, I walked into my room to get a pencil for this quiz-type thing that was on the show.  I had a fairly large window in my room (it faced my neighbor&#39;s feild in their backyard), and we had quite a bit of air traffic in my neighborhood (I lived in a suburban neighborhood), so it wasn&#39;t unusual to have airplanes flying overhead.  But tonight when I looked out there, it was different.  The craft I saw was much to close to be an airplane, and it was noiseless.  I would have missed had I not looked out there.  It was like a &#34;V&#34; in shape, but more boomerang-like.  It had 6 lights that I could see.  It was set up like this:  o O 00 O o        (&#34;o, O, 0&#34; represent lights)  The two lights on the sides (the smallest ones) were not blinking at all.  The two slightly bigger ones were blinking slowly, and the biggest ones (in the center) were blinking rapidly.  It was almost like a code, or a pattern, the way they were blinking.  Every second the middle light blinked, the smaller ones blinked with it (if you could understand that).  The lights seemed to change colors, from a tint of green to a tint of red.  The color that there seemed to be more of was a bluish-white color, like halogen.  It moved south-western directly over my house, and my neighborhood, at speeds slightly faster than I have seen any airplane move.  It could have been an airplane, except for one vital thing.  It was silent.  It was about an estimated 50 feet over house, and if it had been an airplane, my entire house would have reverberated.  Instead it moved silently, smoothly over my neighborhood, right over my roof until I could see it no more.  I dashed to the front of the house, ripping open the door, but it was no more.  The craft had disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
10/6/03 20:12|Annapolis|MD|Triangle|2 minutes|A black triangle near the Naval Academy moved silently and would hover.|10/17/03|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/032/S32267.html|407|ndxe200310| A black triangle near the Naval Academy moved silently and would hover.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was driving east on Ridgely Ave in Annapolis not 100 yards from the Naval Academy.   Overhead to my left I saw a jet coming in the opposite direction from the area of the Academy.  I supposed it to be a commercial jetliner as there are many which fly in that path on their way to BWI (Baltimore Washington International Airport).   There were two white lights on either wingtip and one blue blinking one in the center as well as lights on the front.   It seemed to be flying rather low and unusually slowly, so I kept my eye on it.   When it slowed almost to a standstill, I knew something was not normal.  I broke my gaze just long enough to pull to the curb.   With the car in park I glanced over my shoulder and saw the craft just hovering in place.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Jets don&#39;t stand in one place or they&#39;d drop from the sky, (Harriers excepted), and it was too large for a helicopter.   Besides I had the window open and it was completely silent.   I was able to look more carefully now and saw that the front end was well lit; in fact the nose seemed to be composed entirely of glass panels reminiscent of some WWII bombers.   It was floating about a hundred feet up and was not large, maybe forty to sixty feet across.   I could not make out the exact shape, was it triangular, or fusalage and wings?   I did see that it was painted black.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was straining to see if I could observe anything through the glass panels when it began to move again.   It floated slowly at first, perhaps ten miles per hour, then picked up a little more speed.   My window was open as I said, and it made no sound.   I started my engine and turned the car around in an effort to pursue the craft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was traveling exactly west in a straight line at level altitude.   The speed limit on the road there is 30mph, so it easily pulled away from me and disappeared beyond a stand of trees though it was not moving very fast.   It was out of view for a few seconds by the time my road went over U.S. Interstate 50.   I paused on the bridge and took a look down along Route 50.   There was no sign of it anywhere.   Had it turned north before reaching the highway?   That would mean it was over the Severn River.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I turned around again and went along my original route.   A minute or so later I was on the middle of the Naval Academy bridge which spans the Severn.   Again I looked, but the craft was no where to be seen.   I don&#39;t know what I saw, but my intuition tells me it was not extra-terrestrial, but one of &#34;ours&#34;, albeit using an unconventional form of propulsion.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I stopped in shock and watched it until it suddenly just was gone from sight.  There was no sound and this gave me fear that it was in trouble and about to crash.  I stood there for a few minutes and waited for sound but none came and then went in to call and see if anyone other than I had seen it, I live out in the sticks and it is a very quiet area. This plane was only about 4 full lots in front of me and so big, so low I knew it would go down.But there was no sound from it at all and no following crash sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

All this being said one final note,all the lights and straight line seemed a sort of blur as if the object was spinning,the line might have been the shadow casted from the white and blue lights on the object when it leaned(the line not being true in appearance),but uprighted seemed to disappear along with the red light(s).To finish,I was getting cold and done with the smoke and honestly I didn&#39;t want to believe what I thought I had seen,perhaps being slightly affraid.HEY WHO KNOWS?

Colors at the center changed quickly. Blue,red,silver,orange. It was like a jewel or prizm spinning. It was low on the horizon, not moving, I got my girl friend out side. Then I noticed that 3 more of these objects had the same type of colors pulsing but not nearly as intense as the lowest one. They were far lower in the sky than stars you could discern easily. The three lower intensity ones emitted a gold to bronze color so at first I thought them to be satilights and went back to watching the lowest and brightest one. They were all in a formation of a square. The brite one at 10-15 deg obove horizon and the one on the right was to the lower right of Orions belt. Suddenly they came together and went back as quick as the shutter of a camera could click. They must have covered thousands of miles and back to their original formation in a split second. Now the lowest one got even brighter and looked like the Christmas star depicted in drawings with the rods of light or energy being expelled in every direction at the same time the other three seemed to mellow to a redish-gold color like they were cooling off. I called 911 and asked the dispatcher if any one else had reported an unusual event in the SSE sky and she told me no. I know what I saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I was having a smoke, talking to my bestfriend about my day. I looked off into the distance behind my house. It was North of Kingman, and I was amazed shocked off my rocker at what I saw. I froze in one spot and I don&#39;t remember if I said a word for a while. All of a sudden it hit me and I was like O my God there is a huge saucer floating over my neighbors house. I mean this thing was HUGE and had Gold flashing lights. All it reminded me of was gold and dimonds. It was so bright and so glamour like. It was kinda rotating back in forth in small motions. I started to yell into the phone. I told my friend to 3-way my Mother and get her outside. While she wasn&#39;t answering the phone. I looked back up. Just in time to see the saucer take off. I ran over to my Mom&#39;s house and told her to get her butt outside. She said she was so jealous, because I always catch this kinda stuff. I told her to hang around and see what happens. About 2 mins later about 40 planes filled the sky. They all met over the Cerbat mountians and then seperated. My Mom was like whats going on? Yes we do live by an airport, but I promise you I have never seen more then 5 planes in the sky on any given night. I watch the sky every night for atleast an hour to 5. After the planes left a huge bolt of green light flew out of the sky and landed in the little mountians by my house. At this time my Dad came running out. Then all of a sudden here comes 40 planes again. Then another huge Gold glowing light was hanging over by the Kingman Airport. We looked at it in the telescope and it looked like 2 gold cat eyes. My Parents and I were both blown away! Then here comes all these planes again. Within 5 mintues all the planes were gone. The intense vibe was gone and it was like everything was returned to normal. For the record. I do not take any meds, drugs, and I was not drunk. This was very real and very freaky! Thought I would share my experience!<n>

We were driving in the car in Wapakoneta, OH (The hometown of Neil Armstrong- first man to walk on the moon!) I noticed this light traveling West to East in a downward slope it was a bright light, look bright at a low flying plane of some sort. It was strobing White-Red-slight blue lights then all of a sudden it slowed way down and then we seen it split into 2 small strobing lights. The more we looked at the strobing lights, the more than seem to just simulate a plane. You could definitely tell the difference after awhile. They were more of a fading light. The 2 lights moved opposite direction and then the 2 split again into 4 strobing lights. Moving opposite of each other again. They almost seem to dance in the night sky. If you were to blink at the wrong time, you would have missed them split, it was that fast. All of a sudden, from the north, came some planes that appeared to be headed to that part of the sky. My girlfriend, seen the lights splitting and she stated she seen them split again. There was a few more planes that came in pretty fast with the activity. I don&#39;t know if they seen the activity and wondered what was going on, or they were trying to fly by to cover up the unusual activity. One could only imagine! It was definitely an unreal experience and a true UFO phenomena. Anyone else in Ohio seen this type of activity? If so email me at ((e-mail address deleted))<n>

I noticed nine shining objects in the sky (I was facing East and they would have been located between 45 and 90 degrees up, left of center vision area.  The top three were further distance apart. I looked away to see if anyone else was around, when I looked back up the object on the far right was now on the far left. Three in the center we very close together and one of those three looked very red, about three others appeared to be reddish on the right side - I think that was from reflecting the evening sun, which was behind me. Three of the objects moved to the right. One that was moving form a perfect rectangle to the three that were close together, then kept moving to the left. They did not move like airplanes or other known aircraft. Five of them did not appear to be moving. They were so high up that I could not tell exacctly what they were or exactly how they were shaped. At first I expected whatever they were to be moving closer to the earth (gravity), but it happened in the opposite way. Slowly they began to fade away, as if moving further out into space.  Two remained slightly visible for several more minutes.  They looked like sparkling stars, except it was broad daylight and there were no clouds in the sky. It was much too elaborate to be military - they were too far away and too stationery for too long.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

This is hilly country. Immediately after reaching the top of a hill I spotted a long cigar shaped,white colored object. The object was moving, almost hovering,over some brushland to the east of the highway. We drove in between hills and after reaching another hilltop,the object was no longer visible.  I was driving and my brother was riding shotgun.  We spotted the long object (about size of a full length tractor rig and trailer) at the same time. It was approximately 1500 hrs. No runways exist out there, no airports.  There was no sign of a crash. No dust or smoke. It was moving east at a very slow rate. There was no way it could have gone out of sight in the time it took us to climb the next small hill.Very strange and large object,shaped like a blimp.  The object reminded me of a C-5 Galaxy, an Air Force cargo plane,because of the way it was barely floating along, it was just above the brush. My brothers and I are all school administrator and were headed back from a golf outing. Only two of noticed the strange object. No way an object that big could have made its way out of our sight in five seconds. Strange, very strange.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

There were three distinct lights at what appeared to be the corners, front light had a slight orange tinge and the others were soft yellow.  It took about 10 seconds to cross the middle two thirds of the sky we could see.  We had the radio on low but there was no loud drowning noises detected as you would expect from a chopper or fighter jet.  5 min later we got a better view of the horizon and noticed a couple of aircraft with the standard running lights moving paralell in the same direction about three miles apart and approximately 10,000 feet moving west soouthwest.  There is usually a lot of air trafic in the area anyway since O&#39;Hare airport is only 15 miles away but these were definitely oddities especially the Pyramid shaped object.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

A UFO. I was about to head in to go to bed when I saw a red, small light. I pretty much disregarded it right then and there as a plane, cause after about eight years of looking and getting only 1 or 2 &#34;UFO&#39;s&#34;, you can pretty much tell what is a plane and whats not. But I did another quick glance and noticed that there was another red dot about 2 inches behind it. I remember thinking, &#34;Wow. That plane is flying really close to that other one...&#34; but I noticed that they were flying inunison.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then they both stopped, hovered in the same spot then started moving, south away from me and a very slow rate of speed. After about two minutes of south-ward travel the two lights went vertical, then 2 more lights apeared to the left and right of the previous two, making a lowercase &#39;t&#39; or cross.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The four of them togeather spun slowly counter clock-wise, once, then vanished.

I was periodically waking up throughout the night. The phone rang once which awakened and startled me. I sat up slightly, looked at the VCR and saw that the time was 4:37 a.m. Some flickering lights caught my eye and I sat up some more and looked out the window. I saw a triangular &#34;v&#34;-shaped object with three lights, 2 red on each corner and one white light in the middle. It looked like a plane, however I noticed that the object was moving strangely, slowly descending downward in a &#34;zig-zag&#34; motion. I began to feel a sharp pain in my heart and sat paralyzed looking at the object for what seemed to be 3 minutes. I lowered my body onto the couch and started praying to God, which was very unusual because I don&#39;t usually practice religion. After lying there for a few seconds, I sat up again and looked out the window and the object had disappeared. Eventually I went back to sleep but I did not sleep well. My friend told me in the morning that she had answered the phone around 4:30 a.m. and that there was no one on the other end. There was no number on the call display and it seemed like an odd coincidence that the phone had rang at that specific moment in time.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Upon further observation it became apparent to us that they were not stars because they were smaller than all the other stars and they were flashing in a serial pattern (one after another in order) from green to red color. The flashing made the object appear to be spinning perhaps, or atleast moving slightly, but as we watched (and as we checked on it throughout the night) it continued to be present and obviously out of place. As we are star lovers and fond of viewing constellations we knew that it was not something normally visable in the night sky. It didn&#39;t move rapidly or look like a plane and our only other thought was that it was a space station, but we felt oddly; uncomfortably certain that it was simply a U.F.O. Upon our first spotting of the craft our eyes watered... but that could be merely coincidental; however it was heavy tearing.  The object wasn&#39;t bright enough to take a picture of and was barey visable in well-lit areas.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We suspect the witness may have observed a &#34;twinkling&#34; star.

It moved very slowly in a southeast direction and eventially came to a stop at about 80 degrees above the horizon.It was a warm, calm, and quiet night. There were not any other aircraft in the area at the time of our sighting. I had my father retrieve his 7-35 binoculars which I used for the remainder of the sighting. The crafts altitude was very high for I could not detect its shape. The light then started going off and on,not blinking, but as though a shutter was covering the source,a couple of times slowly, a couple of times fast and then it stayed on. The object stayed stationary for 5 minutes, then the red light went off and revealed a faint white light, and then it instantly accelerated in a southward direction, dropping three red objects as it departed , and was quickly gone over the Santa Monica Mountains.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

I saw lights far in the distance that were red, blue and white.  I couldn&#39;t tell the shape of the object, all you saw were the motion of the lights, but you could watch the way the lights moved. The movement of the lights made it appear as if it was disc shaped.It moved in a circle around the horizon at incredible speeds, around the circumfrence of the city.  It appeared to be skipping up, down, forwards and backwards. It did two counter-clockwise diamond shaped patterns in a row on an unseen path while the lights were flashing.  That is the way it seemed to move; by skipping to a new location, sometimes in short distances, and sometimes at extreme distances. It flashed and skipped to a new point in the sky, then in a flash it skipped back to the same spot. This was all happening below the cloud level. It seemed to have no set destination to its path. It would go backwards (farther away from us) and close again. We lost it in the trees for about 30 seconds because it was so low. We followed it to I-435 and it was south of the highway and then it seemed to cross back across the highway again. It was moving so fast that it seemed it could have gone across the state and back in a few seconds. There was no sound coming from it. It moved like no object I had ever seen before.  Maybe the lights only appearred to flash because of its skipping.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Formation took up 1/3 of front windshield of Rav4 -approx 500 to 1000 feet off ground. Very large! Very distinct unchanging pattern of white lights moving silently in front of us. We stopped and got out of the car but could not hear any noise whatsoever. The far left light was blinking on and off (slowly) - all others were bright and unchanging. The formation that we witnessed matches almost exactly with a previously reported incident in Phoenix, Arizona in 1997 (reference Dr. Lynne D. Kitei)which, when I saw the exact pattern (as re-created on the television documentary) prompted me to write this report as there are no pictures. Object(s) remained in view for approx 3 minutes as it continued to move in front of our location in a Norherly direction- we ran out of roadway in which to follow it further. The location of this sighting corresponds to the intersection of Web Ginn Road and Moon Place and was first viewed between Moon Place and Ronald Reagan Parkway (about 1/2 way between these two roads and moving parallel to Web Ginn road before it turns to the right at the intersection of Moon Place. My daughter drew what she saw in the lower half of a piece of paper. I then drew a picture of what I saw on the upper half of the paper (without looking at her drawing first) and then we compared the two drawings. This is included in this report along with a painting she made (also from memory) for my birthday the following month as a memory of what we saw. She also wrote at the bottom of the painting &#34;Some things are just not to be said... or explained...&#34;<n>

My roomate and I noticed a beam of light coming from the sky which was unusal because there were few clouds in the sky and it was very clear, good weather. This beam of light was a white color and was very distintive like and upside down V. This beam would sort of fade in and out, we watched the beam for about 5 min or so. Just amazed how it would fade in and out . And of course we joked about it being a UFO. Within in another min. or so a very bright ball of light appeared and it just appeared from nothing. It moved left to right, up and down, it moved pretty rapidly but it would just go a short distance. It was sort of like dancing. I know that sounds crazy. At this pint, we knew that it was not a plane, helicopter, weather ballon, or any of the other 100 or so things we tried to make it to be. It was beautiful. And then it just disappeared behind a small cloud. Now I was jumping up and down in the seat telling my friend i needed my camera. Got the camera and waited. Another few minutes passed and we kept and eye onthe cloud we last saw it and sure enough it reappeared and there were 2 of the balls of light. Same size and shape. I can&#39;t tell you how big they were. But to me and my friend they looked like the same. Very bright white balls of light. These 2 did exactly what the first did. Moving left to right, up down, and bouncing, dancing, like i said it was strange. I&#39;m 35 years old and have always been a believer in UFO&#39;s i&#39;ve just never actually  seen one until now. If any one has seen what i&#39;m describing I know how you feel. I am a courier driver i live in the Chattanooga area I drive from 1:00am to 8:00am M-F. I have 2 years of college in the study of Criminal Justice. My roomate is 36 and is a dispatcher for a local trucking company and has been a Over the road truck driver for 5 years in the past.

It lasted for quite a few seconds (10 maybe), and from the outside in quickly faded out of visibility.  The object seemed to be hovering and not moving and was very large, though seemingly distant (If I had held my index and thumb around the edges of the object, it would have been about two inches).  I have never in my life seen anything like this.  I do not believe it was a meteor, as it did not appear to be traveling.  My only speculation is that perhaps it was an airplane on fire, but then again, I did not see smoke, nor did I hear any report of a fallen aircraft.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

This scared and freaked me out so I came in and locked the doors Why I don&#39;t know, but I emailed norad and they actualy replied I still have there reply if you want me to forward it to you.

I noticed five (5) white lights flying over the highway in an odd way.  They appeared to me at first to be airplanes, but after watching more closely, there were no red tail lights.  They moved across the night sky towards a transmission towers that were flashing red warning lights.  At this time, the five lights appeared to hover next to these red lights, making me think they were helicopters searching for something.  I turned my vehicle around to follow the white lights, and as I did, I noticed that the hovering continued until I was probably mile away from the transmission lights, when suddenly all five lights went out simultaneously.  They did not land anywhere, not did anything else appear next to them when the lights went out.  All totalled the experience lasted 8-10 minutes from the time of sighting to the lights shutting off.  To note the type of weather outside was partly cloudy, but warm.  The lights appeared in a well lit area overlooking New Bedford Harbor, and a highway illuminated with many lights.<n>

I also understand others may have seen the same flashing lights. My name is (deleted by HBCC UFO), I live in Ootischenia, just outside of Castlegar, next to the Castlegar Airport.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was a clear night, and I was looking to the north sky at the Big Dipper. I caught a glimpse of a flashing red/green and white light moving across the sky towards the west.  I thought it was an jet flying towards Vancouver, but then I returned my glance towards the east, above the Kootenay River valley, where the &#34;jet&#34; seemed to appear from, I saw another flashing light.  A called my husband, (name deleted by HBCC UFO), to come and see this, and he saw what I saw...then we saw another appear from the east fly over Mount Sentinel and move towards the west.  My three children joined us in our observations of the unidentified objects in the night sky. These were not jets!  Within a few minutes, there were five of these objects in the sky at one time flying in various directions.  Two in particular seemed to meet up with one another and hovered across from one another for about a minute or two, then one flew directly below it, and hovered there for less than a minute, then flew in a north eastern direction towards the back of Mount Sentinel. It flew out of sight, then in about another minute or so, reappeared from the east, (where they all seemed to come from).<n> <n><n> <n><n> We watched these objects for about 15 minutes, then they all disappeared behind the mountains in the horizons.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Tonight, Oct 3, I have so far seen one of these objects fly across the sky from east towards the west.  I plan to be out watching for these things again tonight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thank you for the opportunity to share my experience with you.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thank you to the witness for the report.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Brian Vike, Director HBCC UFO Research Canadian Toll Free UFO Hotline 1 866 262 1989 - Free call.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Home - Phone/Fax 1 250 845 2189 HBCC UFO Forum Board http://216.147.50.102/HBCC-UFO/index.php email: hbccufo@telus.net Website: http://www3.telus.net/public/wilbur8/hbcc_ufo_research.htm<n>

On Friday, October 3, 2002 at 6:45 p.m. she was standing at her kitchen sink washing some dishes looking outside and admiring a beautiful blue sky. She said all of a sudden something dropped down from out of no where. She described it as being oblong in shape and traveling at an angle of approx: 30 degrees. She told me the front of it was kind of blunt, with a &#34;tiny&#34; tail behind it which went to a sharp point. She described the color as being white with a glow around it being an off white color. The sighting lasted for 8 minutes in length as she did check the clock on the wall. It traveled from the northwest heading northeast. The witness did open her window in case she might hear something from it, but no sound was heard at all. From her location, and &#34;guessing the approx: size, she said it would have been roughly the length of her outstretched arm. The witness did contact the local radio station to see if anyone else might have reported it, but no one had.<n> <n><n> <n><n> HBCC UFO Note: One never knows what some of the objects seen in the areas, so I telephoned CKCQ Radio Quesnel to ask if any reports had come in over unusual sightings in the area. The lady I talked with told me yes. Also the newsroom will be getting back to me tomorrow and doing a short interview as I am requesting folks throughout the listening area to make a report if they have seen anything strange over the last while.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thank you to the witness.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Brian Vike, Director HBCC UFO Research Canadian Toll Free UFO Hotline 1 866 262 1989 - Free call.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Home - Phone/Fax 1 250 845 2189 HBCC UFO Forum Board http://216.147.50.102/HBCC-UFO/index.php email: hbccufo@telus.net Website: http://www3.telus.net/public/wilbur8/hbcc_ufo_research.htm<n>

We noticed it, and but five seconds later, the object suddenly vanishes, but in a very peculiar manner. The object first seemed to shrink, and then disappear, although I could see the faintest trace of a trail of white light as the object vanished. I must remark that the way in which this object disappeared is IDENTICAL to the way another UFO faded away when examined on slow motion on a tape - UFO&#39;S X-POSED - comprised of the home videos of many witnesses.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I must also remark that I witnessed, on the same road on a prior date, a long, white cigar-shaped object, which I watched until we turned on to another road.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I submitted at one time a report that my grandmother witnessed - a white light that followed her on her way to work - although I mistakenly reported the year to be 2003, when it occurred 09/01/02.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I watched my friend look out the window, his eyes got all wide, and he pulled the Mini Cougar (Berreta Pistol) he keeps in his glove compartment and pointed it out the window, I kind of swerved because i wasn&#39;t watching what I was doing because I was trying to keep him from shooting at anything, then I watched the lights  speed up, until i could see them in front of us, they started spinning so fast that they looked like a big red band, there was no sound till it started spinning, there was a loud like droning sound, then it was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

We live in a very small town, and my father had to dive my mother to a hospital in nearby Durango.  On his return he pulled to the side of the road to observe a triangular craft with &#34;blinking red and blue lights underneath&#34;, and making no sound as it passed closely over his car.  My father would never lie to me, especially on such a dramatic night, with my mother&#39;s condition and all.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So why am I, a non-witness telling you this ten months after the fact?  I actually forgot about what he told me until I was watching some show on TV about aliens and they showed a triangular craft, reminding me.  I went on the internet to research it and came across this site.  Thought I would go ahead and report the sighting for him, because my dad would never do such a thing, and I just thought it might be helpful.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The object made a short turn at a high rate of speed to the south unitl it was no longer visable.

I live fairly close to the Mobile Airport and am well experienced in seeing aircraft on approach. What I saw, however, was nothing I have seen before. If it had been a single light I would have believed it to be a satellite, but there were aproximately 6-7 lights in a perfect V formation with a single light extended out in front. It moved extremely fast, hence the comparison to a satellite, and the lights were not much brighter then the stars of Cassiopeia which it traveled fairly close to. The formation showed no solid structure, only the dim lights.

In the sky heading north was , relatively speaking ,a huge orange ball with a very short tail , at the time I didn&#39;t think it was going that fast, but from high in the sky to disappearing behind the  horizon was probably less than two minutes, we had actually pulled right, down another street to keep it in sight between the trees , but it was quickly out of sight. It literally looked like a rocket on takeoff, was there a launch?, was it a meteor? Did anyone else see anything?

The craft got smaller and smaller but it was not possible to tell whether it was getting further away or getting smaller.  I&#39;m assuming that it was getting further away.  It seemed therefore to be moving horizontally and further away at the same time, so it&#39;s direction was more NNW to SSE from my vantage point.  I was walking exactly SE according to the map I just consulted.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was nothing on the craft that didn&#39;t glow, and the color of the light was uniformly orange, glowing orange (though not blinding).  Due to this fact I felt compelled to report it, as I&#39;m convinced that it wasn&#39;t &#39;one of ours&#39;.  The orange light wasn&#39;t a &#39;running light&#39; or anything.  The entire craft was glowing orange.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was shaped a bit oblong, like an ellipse with a very large major axis, almost to the point of not being an ellipse anymore, but a cigar.  Its size was such that if you held up your pinky (little finger) you could hide it from view (possibly requiring you to close one eye, although I didn&#39;t try this).<n> <n><n> <n><n> The glow was slightly larger near the front I suppose indicating more volume or mass in the front of the craft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> And, this was definitely NOT Mars.  Although the craft wasn&#39;t moving at any &#39;fantastic&#39; speed, it was still moving quite a bit too much to be mistaken for a planet.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I had emptied in Lancaster, Oh, and was heading to my next pick-up in Haverhill, OH. My first sighting was as I was entering the outskirts of Circleville, OH. I noticed three fire colored (bright orange)lights, in a straight line, that went out back to front. My first thought was it was some tower or plane going through cloud cover. As I watched the area the lights came back on in a different place, stayed on for 5 to 6 seconds, and then went back out. I couldn&#39;t tell how many there were after the first three. I estimate 3-6. They continued this routine, come on, go out, change places, come back on, for approximately 7 to 8 minutes. I don&#39;t know if they stopped the routine, I watched until I couldn&#39;t see them anymore. Another thing, I don&#39;t know if this has anything to do with the lights, but there were also three small points of light that I thought were airplanes at a distance, but they made a triangle around the orange lights. From debth perception, I know the two aren&#39;t physically connected though. A question that might need to be answered is, is there a military base, or testing/practice area close to Circleville?<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

I&#39;m writing to report a UFO sighting. It&#39;s not that exciting, but here it is.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On Wednesday night, October 1, 2003, I was taking a bath. I have a large window over the bathtub facing the Northwest and I like to look at the stars. At approximately 10:40 pm., a glowing white ball dropped from the sky. It did not descend at an angle as meteorites tend to do, nor did it have a green cast. It was absolutely white and it came straight down at very high speed with a white tail of light behind it. It appeared to be fairly close by in that I could see that the object was round. Looking at a map the next day, I determined the exact area my window faces.  It seems likely to me that it came down in the Southern half of the Little Slocan Valley, near Valican, unless the object was huge and therefore, further away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thank you to the witness for the report.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Brian Vike, Director HBCC UFO Research Canadian Toll Free UFO Hotline 1 866 262 1989 - Free call.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Home - Phone/Fax 1 250 845 2189 HBCC UFO Forum Board http://216.147.50.102/HBCC-UFO/index.php email: hbccufo@telus.net Website: http://www3.telus.net/public/wilbur8/hbcc_ufo_research.htm<n>

A couple of witnesses who were working the late shift at the Quesnel Wall mart saw something burning across the sky at a very low altitude. The witness said the object was a brilliant red in color and traveled across the sky until he lost sight of it due to the local mountains. The object was heading to the southeast. Both of the witnesses discussed the sighting and figured out what they witnessed was a meteor. One of the men said there were flames coming off from the back end of it.

The light was really bright.  We stopped the car and I got out and watched it.  It flew right over the top of us.  It was the strangest thing I have ever experienced.  The aircraft was huge, larger than a 3 bedroom house that is 900 sq. ft.. As I looked up at it I wasn&#39;t able to make out a definite shape. It had a light on each side and one in the middle. The one in the middle was red. I worked for an airline and have had many planes fly close to me and this wasn&#39;t like any commercial airliners.  The light sequence wasn&#39;t the same and the shape that I could make out wasn&#39;t like anything I have seen or studied.  The most important thing is that it was completely silent and it was only about 80-100 feet above me. It was going fairly slow and at time seemed to stop and then after it had passed overhead and went about a quarter mile it picked up speed and then disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Besides myself, they have been witnessed by my wife, our eight year old boy, and my wife&#39;s non english speaking mother who was living with us at the time. I bring to point that my mother-in law does not speak english because that shows the level of communication that she and I have. When she first saw the lights in the sky, she led us out into the front yard and asked if we(my wife and I) were in some kind of trouble. The frequency at which they had appeared had became so upsetting to her that she assumed that it was some type of law enforcement watching over our subdivision.<n> <n><n> <n><n> -My home is located about one mile northeast of Kennesaw mountain, and about five miles due north of Dobbins Air Force Base. a huge cell tower sits close to our house and a railroad train right next door along w/ a man made lake (that serves no purpose in our subdivision due to the lack of up keeping).<n> <n><n> <n><n> -The bright white balls of light come up vertically from behind the tree line about a half mile south of my house in direct line of sight with Kennesaw mountain. They come up very slowly in groups of three and post positions equal distance from one another approximately 1500 ft off the ground. They then slowly move one after the other in a single line formation towards and then over my house. I know the height that they are from the ground because I have a cell phone tower IN MY BACKYARD which when they pass over they barely clear. These objects make NO SOUND when moving, and never move faster than approx. 30 knots (the landing speed of a piper cub). From below they look like a triangle shape similar to the stealth F-117 with three lights that would be at the respective nose and two wing landing gear formation. These craft come up in groups of three hover for approx. 5-10 minutes at their posted position then depart with a second group coming up in the same fashion. We have witnessed up to 12 craft in a one hour period on a nightly bases. It apprears that when all craft are airborne they then equally distribute themsevles throughout the marietta/atlanta city areas. This has been going on since october of 2002, maybe i&#39;m just seeing things.

It would be unusual, we believe, for &#34;bona fide&#34; UFO&#39;s to make nightly appearances in the same location.  We believe that lights associated with the nearby military base would be the first possibility to be ruled out, before we could conclude that the witnesses were observing UFO&#39;s.  PD))<n>

I sat there for about 1 minute when it started rotating slowly to the left than to the right like if observing, then it pointed the way it was when i first started watching it. about 2 min. went by when it started moving in a straight line. The line of direction it seemed to come from by the way it was traveling was from the ocean docks of long beach. After i lost sight i went to the other side of the arena where i spoted it again and i told terry the security guard in charge of graveyard. At first he didn&#39;t believe me that it was a ufo untill i told him it&#39;s not making any noise and balloons don&#39;t stop and go, that&#39;s when i think he finally realized he had seen his first ufo. speed was about 5mph and It stoped one more time above a hotel for about 4 min. thats when i looked away to call another co worker and when i looked up it was gone.

All of the sudden there was a massive explosion in the sky.  The sky filled with brilliant white light.  The entire sky in all directions was steadily and heavily illuminated.  It was brighter than daytime, so bright I could barely see.  A ground rumbling explosion also accompanied the light flash at the same time.  The explosion sound, vibrations and the flash all occurred at the exact same time and persisted and stopped at the same time.  This lasted from anywhere from at least 15 seconds to 30 seconds.  The ground shook so violently that I could barely stand up and I almost was thrown to the ground as I tried to run for cover because I thought it was a bomb going off or something. After the event ceased many car alarms where going off and the electric had gone out throughout the neighborhood.  It was a clear night if I recall and there was not any thunderstorm activity.  I can not remember if it was exactly the end of September or the beginning of October, but it was sometime not to long before the Canadian Thanksgiving.  Many people witnessed this including my girlfriend and landlord.  My ears rang and my vision was blurry for a brief time after this occurrence. I have endured many intense and destructive thunderstorms and I can at least tell you that this was not thunder, lighting, or a meteor and if it was and earthquake (which it did feel like), then what was the explosion?  If anyone else witnessed this or knows anything about this please report it to the NUFORC so more information can be gathered about this instance.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

(Bellevue is south of my location)  At approximately 12:20am, I was taking my dog for a final walk before going to bed.  The night was extremely calm, and the sky was extremely clear. (both rare in the Seattle area)  I stood in one spot, waiting for him to do his business, and was scanning the sky for satellites, and constellations.  I finished scanning the north sky, and turned to scan the southern sky (towards Bellevue), and just as I turned, I saw a bright blue-white light, about 5mm wide in the sky (from my point of view) very quickly shoot from west to east with no trail, and disappeared completely after it had traveled about 4 inches (once again, from my point of view).  I took note of the time, becuase it struck me as odd, and seemed to be too large in the sky to be a normal shooting star that would disappear so quickly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I live in a valley, so I cannot be sure how high it was, but it was to the south-south-east, and 65-75 degrees up.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It reappeared thirty minutes later on the water line even brighter for another two minutes.   Unfortunately, we were caught off guard and couldn&#39;t catch it on video.  The police and coast guard called throughout the night as if it was a  flare (I don;t think flaares can hover for two minutes in the same spot).  The coast guard told us that they sent aircraft to investigate.  We watched all night and saw no response.  My guess is they knew that it wasn&#39;t a distress call.  Anyway, it was unlike anything we had ever seen before.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
10/1/03|West Central Missouri|MO|Light||MISSOURI INVESTIGATORS GROUP Report:  West Central Missouri UFO Flap In Early Autumn 2003|11/11/03|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/032/S32947.html|472|ndxe200310| West Central Missouri UFO Flap In Early Autumn 2003 Submitted by Brian Adams of the Missouri Investigators Group investigated the National UFO Reporting Center’s online sighting reports as permitted by Peter Davenport, Director of NUFORC.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A mysterious long UFO seen as a row six very bright amber lights has appeared over the west central Missouri region over several nights in September and October in 2003.   The UFO was reported by farmers, factory workers and commuters that consisted of either seeing the object hovering over the pastures off the side of the road or moving over the trees in dense woods.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So far there hasn’t been any report of unusual animal deaths or close encounters associated with the UFO sightings.  However, there has been a recently reported corn field crop formation that was reported on October 4th where this UFO did appear over is currently under investigation.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It began on the evening of September 6th with a couple of Pleasant Hill, MO area residents driving up over a small hill on a rural road then stopped to watch a strange row of bright lights hovering over a field between Harrisonville and Pleasant Hill.  I called Amber C. the girlfriend who witnessed this UFO.  Amber told me the UFO was lit up with six very bright amber lights that made it hard to determine any real shape of the craft. But after observing it for only a few moments the UFO lights suddenly went out and no object was seen at all in the dark sky.  Amber said they didn’t hear any sounds by the UFO at any time.  The weather was clear and warm.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On the evening of September 9th Rick D. was driving back home to Independence from his farm in Shawnee Mound on Highway 13 in northern Henry County near the Johnson County line.  Rick noticed some bright amber lights in the direction he was traveling believing that there was an accident ahead on the highway.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Coming around a curve expecting to see emergency vehicles Rick instead saw something quite strange instead.  Cars were parked on both sides of the highway so he slowed down to see why.  Through the windshield Rick saw hovering over the east side of the road two parallel sets of six bright lights that each arched slightly over the trees near an abandoned gas station.  No sounds were heard coming from the UFO outside by Rick at any time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Rick realized that the other drivers had stopped just to watch these lights in the sky.  A small gap between the sets of lights was noticed but Rick said he couldn’t see any structure at all because of the bright lights.   Rick then attempted to take a photo of the UFO through the passenger side window as he got closer.  (The film was developed a day later and it only showed a faint ball of one of the UFO lights through the window. Rick’s camera’s flash was unfortunately on and it obscured most of the UFO lights outside revealing mostly the interior of his vehicle.)  Suddenly the UFO lights blinked out and nothing else was seen in the except for the full moon rising up in the clear sky.  Rick wanted to stop and find out what the other drivers thought about the UFO but they all began to drive away in both directions. Rick said at least twenty cars had pulled over but he thought it was strange that nobody stayed after the UFO was gone.  So he drove on home while listening to a nearby Warrensburg radio station’s talk show hoping somebody would mention the UFO sighting.  But nobody called and no news about it was reported.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The next evening on September 10th in Clinton, MO at 10 pm Edwin S. reported that he observed a strange ball of yellow light the size of a dime at arms length that was very low to the northeast at 10 pm while letting his dog outside. The UFO moved to the north before getting lost in the trees.  Edwin called the Clinton Police Department but there were no other reports of this object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In Windsor, MO in northeast Henry County is where a factory worker named Logan M. was out on a break on the factory parking lot just after midnight on September 11th. While in his truck with a buddy the two noticed a very bright light moving very low above the trees to the south.  Assuming it was a plane or helicopter coming in their direction it was apparent that it wasn’t a normal aircraft approaching.  I spoke to Logan and he told me that the light began to move slowly towards them in a northerly direction but it didn’t make any sound at all.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The silent UFO really impressed them Logan said and as they watched it flew virtually overhead. Underneath the UFO it had two yellow lights at each apex with a much larger yellow light in the middle that Logan called a dome. (see attached drawing of the UFO by Logan).  The UFO continued over Windsor but turned in a SW direction soon disappearing behind trees.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Later that night at the factory Logan said that his buddy told him while he was outside taking trash out to the dumpster in the rear parking lot he saw the same UFO lights appear again. The next day Logan met another factory worker who said his girlfriend mentioned that she saw the UFO. The girlfriend called to see if the Henry County Sheriff’s office had any sightings reported.  The Sheriff’s office in Windsor did say that they got dozens of other calls that evening.  They reported   seeing a strange lighted aircraft flying over the town but the Sheriff’s office told them that everything was okay.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In our interview Logan said that this was not a B-2 Stealth Bomber or a military helicopter at all.  Living just ten miles south of the home base B-2 called the 509th bomber squadron Logan said that everybody has seen and heard the B-2’s flying by in their takeoff and landing patterns numerous times.  “The B-2’s are loud and they have normal flashing and landing lights.  This (UFO) thing didn’t at all.  It was very strange.  Obviously, the other witnesses felt the same way as I did after seeing this thing.”  Then on September 23rd in central Missouri two strange but separate sightings about a half hour apart were reported by the witnesses seeing a similar looking UFO near their homes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Around 9:00 pm a semi-retired cattle farmer named Jerry C. was driving home on a rural road in western Iron County near Boss, MO.  While going up a hill Jerry suddenly saw six very bright amber lights in a straight row appear just above the woods on the north side of the road.  The lights were hovering and not blinking at all but were the size of soccer balls.  To get a better view Jerry said that he stopped and as he began to back up the lights immediately went out.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At 65 years old Jerry said that he never has seen anything like this before.  His stock dog was riding in the bed of the pickup truck.  Jerry said that the dog seemed to be very nervous and scared.  Jerry emailed me a couple of days later saying that he was out cutting some firewood on a ridge and when he was finished noticed his dog had disappeared.  “The dog is always at my side and doesn’t chase my cattle. So I looked around and found the dog had been hit by a car.  It was suffering and I had to put a bullet in him.  Funny thing is that this is the exact spot on the road where we saw the UFO.  Weird isn’t it?”  Then at 9:30 pm Daniel K. and his mother were inside their home watching TV on the north side of Cuba, MO or about fifty miles north of Jerry’s farm.  Daniel’s mom then noticed a strange lighted object through a window moving above the trees.  She and Daniel saw five horizontal lights for a few seconds appear to the south of their backyard.  They ran out to the back porch to see what it was but the lights went out.  Suddenly the lights appeared again to the southwest but then the lights turned off again. There was no sound of an aircraft heard at all.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I called Daniel’s home and spoke with his mother about their sighting report.  She estimated that the lights were four and a half miles away because a main road called Highway F is about that far from their home.  She said that they’re surrounded by thick woods so it was difficult to see because the UFO was flying low just above the tree tops.  She said Daniel did call the Cuba Police Department to see if anyone else had reported seeing the strange lights in the sky but there was none.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Another weird report came in from the Pleasant Hill area on October 10th.  James H. said that a week earlier his brother-in-law found a strange crop formation while harvesting a corn field on Saturday morning October 4th.  While up high inside the cab of the combine the brother in-law saw that the corn stalks had been cut down at ground level in a perfectly square area he said was 10 by 10 feet.  He got inside the formation and noticed that the cobs or ears of corn had been removed from the cut stalks and then pressed down into the soil with the cobs standing in a pattern.  It looked like an 8 with a small line or a 1 at the side of the 8.<n> <n><n> <n><n> But unfortunately instead of going around the formation the brother in-law drove the combine through it. The brother in-law told James he even got off of the combine to pick up the cobs stuck in the ground and put them into the combine.  However, the brother in-law did notice that the cobs hadn’t spoiled so whatever did cause the formation happened recently.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Nobody has been into the corn field since to check for any evidence afterwards because of the area in question is several hundred yards from any road plus recent rains has made the ground very soft so it’s inaccessible even by 4 wheel drive.  Hopefully later this fall a visit will be successfully made to the crop formation spot to gather samples.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Now what is interesting to this crop formation and the September 6th Pleasant Hill sighting is that this corn field is exactly where the witnesses observed the UFO hovering over that evening.  The rural road the witnesses were on called Christmas Tree Lane is the south property line of the corn field just east of Highway 7.  They saw their UFO on the north side of the road over the corn field.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It’s still possible that there are other witnesses in the area who may have seen this UFO as well but they have decided to not report their sighting or mention it to anyone.  The Missouri Investigators Group (UFOMIG.com) will continue to pursue additional witnesses and do follow-up investigation on these UFO reports.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Updated: I&#39;m tonight (Nov. 8th) just reading the recent sightings over Missouri the first week of November, 2003.  On Nov. 4th, 2 more UFO reports having a straight row of 3-6 very bright amber lights seen over Elisnore and Greenville and on Nov. 5 a UFO seen over St. Joe similar to the Windsor, MO craft.
