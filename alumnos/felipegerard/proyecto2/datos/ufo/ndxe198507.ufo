I&#39;m an amateur astronomer and I have frequently followed the Space Shuttle(s) and other satellites. I had read in the news that the shuttle would be overhead so I went outside to my backyard a few minutes early to get adjusted to the dark. I saw the Shuttle exactly at the time that was mentioned on the news. This was the first time I had seen a Space Shuttle overhead. I yelled for my mom to come out to see. At this time I noticed another light trailing the shuttle maybe the distance of your hand if you held it straight up. This ball of light was slightly smaller than the shuttle and I forget the color. Anyway as my mom was walking out the small ball of light shot silently and instantaneously down behind the foothills. I was facing west at the time. All I saw was a beam of light somewhat similar to a bright Perseid meteor shooting behind the hills. The ball of light was gone. My mom never saw it since she was still walking outside. I&#39;ve still remembered it to this day since I&#39;m pretty skeptical of UFO reports but I don&#39;t know of any explanation for this.  I&#39;m filing this report because I&#39;m wondering if anyone has seen similar things especially near a Space Shuttle.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date in July 1985 is approximate.  PD))<n>

Myself and 3 friends and their 2 dogs went out to a place near Woodside, CA more specifically to a place called Windy Hill at 4 corners where highway 84 (Woodside Road) crosses Skyline Blvd.  You can see 360 degrees from San Francisco to San Jose, The Pacific Ocean and San Francisco Bay.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was approximately 11:30 pm and we had gone up to check out the view when I noticed 6 or 7 colored lights in the sky over what seemed to me to be approximately Half Moon Bay.  These lights were flying around and turning different colors, blue, green, red, yellow and orange but flying so fast and in such a way that there is no plane or helicopter that could possibly make the moves that these lights were making, zig zagging and going in circles just crazy moves and then would fly way out over the ocean what seemed like 50 miles in about 2 seconds and then come back and then towards the Bay and back and towards us and back, not together at all, they acted independently of one another and I was so frightened, I wanted to leave before they saw us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I said out loud, are you guys seeing this?  Are we all seeing this? They all said oh yes! What the hell are those?  Let’s get out of here!  I am sorry I can’t recall the exact date and time because it was so long ago.  But it is something I will never forget.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

I was operating a crane for Canadian National Railroad by the Miramichi River when I noticed a black triangle hovering about 150 feet above the river and center over the river.  I was about 200 feet away from it. At first I thought somebody was flying a large kite so I looked on the banks of the river to find a person flying it, but nobody was there I looked back at it and it was in the center of the river, so I thought somebody must be in a boat flying the kite but nobody was there.  My 85 ft. Boom on the crane was bouncing up and down due to bad tracks that I was on.   Then it flew south at a high speed towards small mountains about 5 miles away.  Taking about 1 second to get there.  I thought I frighten it as my boom looked like cannon but 2 jets from Chatham air base.  Flew over my head and went exactly the same direction as the ufo disappeared on the horizon.  The jets was going real! slow compared to the UFO. It was black about 20ft.  Long, only about 6 in. Thick. It was a clear sunny day I did not see any lights.  When I got home I called the airport in Moncton New Brunswick and they just listen to me.  A few days after it was in the local newspaper and it said the triangle was seen across Canada.  After this happened I started to read a lot of books on UFO&#39;s.  One day I read a book which I do not remember the name it but when I opened it to a certain Page I seen a picture of the same thing I seen.  The book said it was remotely control by a mother ship 250 miles above earth.<n>

The object slowed down and finally went level and light quickly dimmed, and object appeared to land<n> <n><n> <n><n> We, my girlfriend and I, were sitting on my car at the Texas Ranger ballpark about 3a.m..  We both had summer jobs at the park and were saying goodnight after seeing a late movie.  The object looked like a cigar (saucer from a side view) and in July in Dallas there is a haze.  The light which was a bright green lit up the sky (in the general proximty, as it entered the area (trajectory-planet re-entry) perhaps even steeper than 45 degrees. I knew it was not a metorite, because I have been real close, &lt;.5mi when I was a youngster, and had just finished 2/4hr. courses on astronomy.  Furthermore, as it neared the ground, it de-acclerated tremendously.  Gravity forbids (my understanding of physics) meteors from doing this. The green &#39;haze&#39; quickly dimmed as the object slowed and leveled and shortly thereafter, continued its angle of decent, as it slowed it became faint and finally disappeared all together.  The proximty of the sighting was somewhat close to DFW airport, it was moving to fast and appeared and disappeared to quickly to be an aircraft. We chased, but really had no idea as to the actual distance of the object. I told my father about the sighting and he told me he had heard of several sighting the general area of DFW airport in that general time frame. The green light looking like a craft slowing down at high speed, and the light was a shield or barrier to protect the craft. One last detail we were looking west towards Dallas, but the Ballpark was along I-30 and well south of the airport. I did not know of anyway of reporting the incident before now, and unlikely the information will be of any use, but the story is very accurate.<n>
7/24/85 21:00|Del Rio|TX|Diamond|2 minutes|Sighting in Del Rio, Texas|7/5/08|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/064/S64069.html|5|ndxe198507| Sighting in Del Rio, Texas<n> <n><n> <n><n> The years was 1985. My friend and I were 15 years old. My friend and I were sitting on our bikes one night. We were sitting on them in the middle of the street in Del Rio, Texas. The streets were 11th and Ave B. We were talking and for some reason we both looked up. I guess we had both heard a subtle air or whisper sound. I couldn’t really tell you that we heard much of anything. I just know that some kind of noise or feeling made us both look up right at it at the same time. It’s not like we ever sat out there looking at stars. We were facing North east and the craft was heading north west. It was a diamond shape made up of faint lights. There were no lights visible inside the diamond. It looked as if it was going maybe 70 to 80 MPH and was about a mile above us. Maybe as big as a football field. It was as if it was disguised within the starts of the night. But we could see the diamond. There is an airforce base in Del Rio and I am familiar with just about every kind of craft that flies out of that base. My Dad worked there for 30 years and I grew up there. This was big, cloaked and whisper quiet. We ran inside screaming, told my friends mom and that was all we saw. Never saw it again.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I driving across Mercer Island.   I noticed several were slowing or pulled off to the side of the road.  I thought there was an accident ahead on the freeway.  I slowed too. While, I waited I glanced up at the clear colbalt blue night sky. Just above the tree line was this gigantic brightly lite floating ship sitting stationary E to W.   Underneath the hovering silent ship were 25  (cubes or rectangle shaped) smaller craft being off loaded or launched.They seemed to all have bright headlights.  Wow.  The smaller crafts were all flying in different directions N to S, SW, SE, NE, NW.  I decided it was time to continue on to work. When I arrived the  supervisor asked me if I had seen anything unusual in the night sky. Yes. Then he told me we were going to have a crew meeting. After the crew meeting he sd you can go home early. He said we were slow this evening.   I thought thats unusual because we were usually busy after lunch.   As I was driving home I noticed that all the planes were flying very low. There are several airports near by. I thought perhaps the space craft had done something to the flight path.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I arrived home. Everything was prefectly normal. I was watching late night TV.  Suddenly my dog started acting strangely. Her hair was all ruffled up on the back of her neck and she was whining. From the couch I looked out the window and standing on the deck  were 4 or 5 red or orange miltary insigna uniformed males with primate features.Their foreheads were slanted, copper color, they had bushy eye brows, dark eyes,short necks. Their bodies were covered in military uniform. I didn&#39;t see their shoes.  I couldn&#39;t figure out how they had gotten there on to the deck.   They were tall around 5ft 8. They had a fierce presence. My friend was sitting at my feet growling and whining.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then all was quiet.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Next I was closing the window facing East looking out on the deck, the sun was coming up. My face felt hot, my hair was dirty, my tongue hurt,I had an odd metalic taste in my mouth.I felt fatigued. I was very angry.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My dog was laying at an odd angle on the couch. She perked up when I closed the window. Like it was a signal. She wagged her tail and I comforted her.I looked up at the clock and it was very late. I could not figure out why we were still on the couch.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Afterwards, I had difficulty eatting anything from a tin can.   I had to use plastic utensiles instead of metal. I couldn&#39;t see shadows when we went walking in the dark. I had to keep the lights on when we were sleeping. I was told not to talk about our adventure.  I wasn&#39;t threatened. They definitely told me they were coming back. That they were going to be around. I finally went to a doctor who practices alternative medicine and he told me that I was not alone. I am surviving. There isn&#39;t anything I can do about them anyway.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My dog died when she was 5 or 6 years old too soon. That was along time ago.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Best regards,<n>

I definitely know the difference between rotary and winged aircraft, and I know the sounds that they make when airborne.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I saw something in 1985 that was extremely strange: a small (approximately 30 feet across) round craft, making absolutely NO noise whatsoever; and in the same month, a VERY large triangular shape floating silently in the early morning sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At the time, I was staying at a friend&#39;s house, having just moved from San Diego, California, to Concord, California.  The first sighting was at approximately 9 pm (2100 hours), and the people that I was staying with, and myself, were sitting together in a hot-tub spa.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This &#34;vehicle&#34; was blinking red, orange, green, blue and white lights, flying directly over us at approximately 1500 feet altitude, making no noise at all.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The second sighting was at approximately 4 am (0400 hours) at about 2000 feet altitude, also making no noise at all, later in the same month. (The house was within 2 miles of the Concord Naval Weapons Center, which, at that time, had nuclear weapons stockpiled. In fact, there were several protests about the Weapons Center having those weapons there.)<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had gotten up around 4 am to get a glass of water from the kitchen, and upon looking out the kitchen window, spotted what appeared to be a triangular shaped craft. It looked to be enormous, possibly about the size of a football field in length, except for being triangular.  It made absolutely NO noise, and was heading East, toward the Naval Weapons Center.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The reason that I didn&#39;t report the sightings then, was because I was afraid that no one would believe me (or us), and didn&#39;t want to be locked up for being &#34;crazy&#34; or something.  Now, I have had approximately 1500 hours of flying time as a passenger in both helicopters and jet aircraft, so I&#39;m pretty sure that these &#34;vehicles&#34; were NOT currently in the Air Force&#39;s inventory, at least not as Un-classified aircraft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Since these were technically Unidentified Flying Objects, I would not be able to say that they were extraterrestrial in nature, but just unidentified.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

I was trying to sleep and my cousin was laying with his head out the tent door and kept talking about a moving white light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thinking it was just a satellite, I did not look until told me it was changing directions instantly at high speed. When I looked, at first I could see nothing...but he told me to watch in this one area for a moment. What appeared to be a big, bright star took off instantly and shot across the sky at an unbelievable rate. It then stopped just as suddenly, making it hard to find, as it just blended in with the stars when not moving. Every once in a while, it would move slowly, maybe making small little circles before shooting back across the sky. Sometimes it would zig zag erratically across the sky, even changing directions 180 degrees without slowing down. The object seemed to travel back and forth generally in a line SE to NW. I watched it for about an hour, and finally got tired and went to sleep. My cousin watched for some time after that, and I think it was still visible when he went to sleep as well. When telling my Dad about it, he said that my uncle had seen similar lights, but in greater numbers. He lived about 10 miles away at Iron Mountain,MO and on many summer nights sat on his front porch watching them. One night one of them fell from the sky out of sight behind the treeline, and immediatly all of the other lights converged on that area and hovered for a few minutes before dispersing again. My uncle was not the type to make up stories about UFO&#39;s, and as a matter of fact I don&#39;t think he talked about it much for fear of people thinking he was crazy.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I read just a year or two ago about a professer doing research around Van Buren MO on UFO&#39;s in the 70&#39;s (I think). The visual desciption and movement of what he studied sounds as though it was the exact same thing my uncle, cousin,and myself saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.

The recent death of Betty Hill has convinced me that people are interested int this subject, and since I have something to add, I should go ahead and tell the whole story.  I was fifteen, and after the ten o&#39;clock news went down to the beach of our rented summer cabin, as was my habit, to go have a cigarette.  I saw a light on the horizon, hovering over the waves, but was not too bothered by it.  But I felt somehow drawn to it, and kept walking towards the light.  Then, at once, I discovered I was over knee-deep in water, at a fairly low tide.  I hurried back to the beach, in which the light started climbing, slowly, but surely, towards the sky.  Then, a couple other objects shot down, and the group of them begans to bounce around the coastline, up and down, with every once and awhile one coming in close.  By this time I had climbed the stairs and was watching from a lookout, joined by my father, who was poo-pooing the whole idea, though he did not have his glasses, and could not come up with a reasonable explaination for the lights he DID see.  After a long time of observation, one by one, the lights shot up straight into the sky, like a bottle rocket,and we went back to the cabin.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We went back to the cabin, and I went to my room, but I couldn&#39;t sleep.  I fell asleep reading &#34;The Great TV Sitcom Book&#34;  What happened next I have no way of proving or disproving, but in my heart and my mind I know that it DID happen: I awoke, after sleeping a short time, and heard a noise on the porch.  I went to the window, and saw at least five bald headed men wearing long, black jackets, waiting at the front door.  As I watched, the porchlight went out.  They were trying to open the front door, and as they did, the porchlight faded and so did my recall.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The next morning I awoke as if I had had nightmares, and hadn&#39;t slept well.  Bruises and soreness were present, yet it was a few days before I associated it with that night.  I was in a bit of a fog.  I walked many times to the lookout, where I watched this craft, but had no clear knowledge of why.  Later on I went home and tried to put the whole thing behind me.  Obviously I haven&#39;t.  I can still see the five men, light glaring off thier bald heads, trying to force their way in to the cabin and knowing that I had no choice in the matter<n>

These lit probes moved together yet each constant lit tiny light moved as if separate, and knowing we were there, it was coming after us because we were there.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We hardly ever talk about it, except now that we are older, I have begun to wonder more strongly what encountered us, we tried to rule out anything alien, because I do not believe life exist in space.

The date is not exact, it was in the summer but it could have been in 84 or 86.  Also, just to clarify, when I say UFO, I mean that as strictly an unidentified flying object because that is what I saw; I make absolutely no claim that it was military, extraterrestrial, or something else altogether.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My mother and I where driving into Belleville at night.  A few miles from the small airfield at Mountainview we saw a large metallic disc flying towards us from the direction of Belleville.  We slowed to a stop and watched it.  It came to a stop about 100 feet in front of us and hovered about 50 feet in the air.  My mom and I were both speechless and just watched it for about 2 minutes.  It was very large (maybe 30 or 40 feet in diameter) and it didn’t make a sound.  I could only hear the crickets chirping in the grass.  It didn’t have any lights around it but (this sounds goofy, I know) it had what looked like a window or a windshield of some sort.  I remember looking in it trying to see if I could see anybody.  I couldn’t.  It was like looking into a 2nd story window of a house, all I could see was the ceiling.  It wasn’t frightening at all; I remember only a profound sense of awe.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After it had hovered there for about 2 minutes it flew off in the direction of Trenton (it’s probably relevant to point out that there is a large military base located there).  Its flight was very smooth and extremely fast—it was gone in seconds.  The flight path of the thing was like a &#34;V,&#34; coming from Belleville, stopping in front of us, then flying toward Trenton.  I personally have never heard of any aircraft that can fly that pattern, that fast, stopping in mid air, and never make a single sound.  When it was gone, I looked over to my mom in the passenger seat and asked her if she had seen it too.  She said, &#34;Yes, but let’s never tell anybody.&#34;  I agreed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Years later I told my sister about it and she didn’t believe me (no surprise), so I told her to phone mom and ask her for herself.  She did and my mom said quite plainly, &#34;I don’t talk about that.&#34;  Not corroborating evidence that would hold up in court but the fact that my mother didn’t deny it and at least implied that there was something to ‘not’ talk about convinced my sister.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So that’s what I saw.  I can’t prove it but I swear it’s the truth.  No little green men, no lights in the sky that would more accurately fit the description of a LEO satellite, but one very large metallic disc just hanging there in the air in front of me.  I really wish I knew exactly what it was and where it was from.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date of sighting is approximate.  PD))<n>

My wife and I saw the exact, and I mean exact same object over 20 years ago in Georgetown, Texas, 25 miles north of Austin. We were freshmen in college and dating at the time - we were standing outside in my parents driveway at about 11pm when we saw what appeared to be a very large, delta-shaped object with lights below it and a bright light shining out in front (similar to a helicopter). This object was coming from the North and passed directly over our heads at an altitude of about 500 feet. We were sure at first it was a very quiet military plane until it passed over and it made absolutely no sound whatsoever. I joked as it came towards us that it was a UFO and my wife laughed until it passed quietly overhead - she then burst into tears. It passed over fairly slowly, the whole episode took about 45 seconds. We called the Sheriffs department who told us that they had been swamped with calls about the object. They also told us that they thought it was probably an experimental aircraft out of Fort Hood in Killeen, 30 miles north of Georgetown. After reporting it my wife and I pretty much kept it to ourselves unless people were telling UFO stories. It didn&#39;t seem extremely important to me until I saw that drawing and read of the close proximity to where we saw our object. Note: When I asked my wife is she remembered the event she said &#34;of course&#34; but neither of us can remember exactly what month or year it was, it was either 1985 or 86 and it was summer, probably July and it was definitely late, around 11 or 12. I know this isn&#39;t complete but I couldn&#39;t read that couple&#39;s experience and not comment for whatever it&#39;s worth.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Lights grouped in three&#39;s - red/wht/red<n> <n><n> <n><n> Back in high school I got a phone call from a neighborhood friend and he said that his brother while coming home from work and driving down Main St. getting ready to turn on our street saw something in the sky and to get outside and check it out.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I went outside and started to look up the street to where my friend lived to see if he was outside and saw him then I saw the craft one block over to the north coming from the West and could&#39;nt bellieve it. It was moving very slowly. As we were watching it I ran to my neighbors house to tell them to come outside and check this out and they witnessed it also. As we were all watching it it began to move sideways while still moving forward; like a crab moves.The lights did not move sideways then straighten back out; everything stayed pointed forward. Then it basically stopped moving sideways once it was over our street and continued moving straight forward. As it approached us it made no noise whats so ever. The configuration of the lights on the bottom of the craft were in the pattern of a parallelogram but not sure of the shape of the craft because it was dark against the dark night sky. The lights were arranged in a straight line, front to back, in groups of three. One samll white light, one larger red light, and one more white light. Then back and off to the side was another grouping and this repeated staggering left to right to the end of the craft. As the craft passed over head you could hear a low, dull humming noise but no sign of an exhuast area you might asscociate with with aircraft we know of. It was very low and by the shape of the lights it was quite large. Exact size is hard to say but guess-timating I&#39;d say it was the lenght of one and a half to two yards(house lots in my neighborhood- approx. 75 to 100&#39; long) It flew in a straight line from that point until it disappeared from sight out toward Long Island Sound to the East. One thing I remember was the neighbors house I went to, his father was was visiting and he worked for Chrysler Corp. and he said that he never heard a &#39;engine&#39; like that before in his life. My father is a single engine aircraft pilot and use to buzz the house from time to time and the lights on his plane were much, much smaller than the lights on this thing. One news report going around was that it was pilots flying ultralights trying to fool people but that was in the Puoghkeepsie, NY area and if you&#39;ve ever heard ultralights engines you&#39;d know these were&#39;nt ultralights(even if somehow muffled). Another thing was that this craft moved as a single entity, not multiple craft trying to be one. Well, that&#39;s it. This is the first time telling this story in a forum like this and it has stayed vividly with me since it happened.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.

I was in or just out of high school and the years were between 1984-1987, (I know I was driving so probably closer to senior year of 1985), and had driven over to a friends house to hang out. We were listening to tapes and talking upstairs when the entire house began to rumble and shake. The window sills, door frames etc actually were vibrating and shaking. It sounded like a plane, low distance rumble which slowly increased.  We both ran to the window and to our amazement were shocked to see a v shaped object with wings and windows and coloered lights flying just over the tree tops of the house and development.  It had to be at least 100 feet long. Lights shot out of it hitting the ground and house. As it moved over the house we ran to the back window and looked at it.  It appeared to change shape or get smaller with long red, yellow and blue beams shining into the house windows on the first floor.  During this time my friends family had guests over and were eating in the dinning room.  We ran down the stairs to see the Dining Room flooded with these beams of colored light but no one seemed to notice us or was even aware of the lights except for my friend and I.  It was as if we were privy to see this and no one else was.  As we watched what must have seemed for awhile we noticed the lights scanned the entire inside of the home where my friends parents were entertaining.  Everyone appeared to be moving in slow motion but us. We diliberaely stayed aware from the lights.  We grabbed our car keys and ran out side to the backyard which was boardered by trees and watched as it slowing moved over the shubbery and out over some empty farmland in back.  The shape appeared to be long and rectangular but the beams of light gave it a spider like quality.  We then hoped in our car hoping to follow it, the car didn&#39;t start right away and when we got out to where we could see it again it had just head out towards NYC up into the air.  The funny part is -my friends parents didn&#39;t see anything we! re compl etely unaware of anything during the whole experience.  Needless to say, to this day my friend won&#39;t talk about it and what we saw I can not explain - just that later that summer, I and my mother were visited by a bouncing ball of blue light which slowly bounced across our backyard and then after I got back in bed appeared at my bedroom window - flooding my bedroom with an electric blue light.  My bed shock and I was paralized and unable to move unitil it left. To this day,  I do know that since I have been real little I&#39;ve had experiences at seeing things and encounters up to my present age. I just don&#39;t have anyone to talk to about them or to turn to.  If anyone during 1984-1987 saw anything like this late in the evening can you please right about it.  I know this was to large for someone else not to have seen unless it was meant to happen like that.  Please note, at this point in time I would like to remain unknown.  Thank you. Signed, one inncident of many.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  Source is anonymous.  PD))<n>

It  was late evening, everyone was in bed. In my friend&#39;s room we were up late talking and giggling,trying not to  wake anyone-or get  in trouble.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I sat up in bed to look out the window. I had this strange feeling. I looked in the yard -nothing. I looked up, and there, to my left, above the trees was a ufo. This was what I remember; the craft was hovering, not too high, at an angle. The side closest to the ocean tilted slightly down. The house itself was three blocks from the  water, and the craft appeared to be just a bit closer than that. It  was  saucer like, fat in the middle, and I remember  thinking how it looked very sleek. The moonlight reflected off the craft, illuminating it&#39;s shape. It might even have  been a full moon that night  which inspired me to look out the window.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The  craft had lights (round)  encircling it. They  would seemilngly rotate around the craft, changing colors on the way back around. I remember seeing blue and red, aswell as orange.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I casually told my friend there was a ufo outside, to impress her with my blase  attitude. She didn&#39;t believe me at first, but then she saw it. We sat in her bed for a while staring at it. W e  thought about waking her  grandparents, we  joked  about very tiny green men marching in the house if  we didn&#39;t  wake them. My friend went to  sleep shortly afterward. I would occasionaly check to make sure the craft was still there:it was reassuring.  The next thing I  remember is  realizing I had fallen asleep. I sat up in bed and looked out the window  again but,the craft was gone.<n>

MY SON, WIFE AND MYSELF WITNESSED A LARGE HEXAGON SHAPED OBJECT IN THE NIGHT SKY. COULD NOT TELL THE EXACT OUTER SHAPE. IT WAS COMPOSED OF SIX HEXAGONAL SHAPED LIGHTS, ARRANGED IN A HEXAGON SHAPE. NOT BRIGHT, BUT CONSTANT IN BRILLIANCE. THE LIGHTS WERE A DIFFUSED COLOR. (THE INTENSITY OF A LAMP SHADE, LIGHT CREAM TO TAN). I NOTICED THAT I COULD NOT SEE ANY STARS IN THE SKY BETWEEN THE LIGHTS. THE OBJECT APPEARED TO BE OF SINGULAR ORIGIN AND NOT SIX INDIVIDUAL. THE CRAFT (S) WERE ON THE SAME WESTERLY DIRECTION AS THE AIRLINE.<n> <n><n> <n><n> THE REASON I NOTICED THE OBJECT WAS DUE TO THE PASSING OF AN AIRLINER JUST BEFORE AND I WAS WATCHING THE PROGRESS OF THE IT MOVING IN A WESTERLY DIRECTION. THE UFO LATER USED THE SAME PATH. COULD NOT TELL THE ALTITUDE OF IT, BUT SEEMED TO BE AT THE SAME HEIGHT AS THE AIRLINER. HOWEVER MUCH LARGER. (THERE WAS NO NOISE OF ANY KIND) I LIVED AT THE TIME RIGHT NEXT TO THE NAVAL AIR BASE IN BELLE CHASSE AND WAS WONDERING WHY NO MILITARY AIRCRAFT WERE ALERTED TO INTERCEPT THIS UFO, LIKE THEY ALWAYS SEEM TO CHASE EVERY UNKNOWN OBJECT IN THE PASS. I LATER ASSUMED THAT IT COULD BE A SECRET TYPE OF CRAFT OWNED BY THE MILITARY AND KEPT HUSH HUSH ABOUT THE OBJECT. I FELT ODD ABOUT REPORTING THIS IN THE PASS, BUT FINALLY REALIZED THAT IT WAS PROBABLY EITHER NOT SEEN ON THEIR RADAR OR THEY KNEW WHAT IT WAS. I HAVE NEVER SEEN ONE LIKE THIS BEFORE OR SINCE.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I WAS IN THE AIR FORCE DURING THE LATE FIFTIES AND I THE RESERVES IN THE SIXTIES. I STUDIED ELECTRONIC AND HYDRAULIC UNITS FOR AIRCRAFT AND MISSILES. I OWNED A CESSNA IN THE SEVENTIES AND HAVE SEEN OTHER THINGS THAT WERE CONSIDERED UFO SIGHTINGS WHILE FLYING, BUT COULD HAVE BEEN EXPLAINED AS EITHER NATURAL OR MAN MADE TYPES.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I WOULD LIKE TO KNOW IF ANY ONE HAS SEEN AN OBJECT AS DESCRIBED ABOVE IN THE PASS OR RECENT HISTORY. I HAVE OFTEN WONDERED WEATHER THESE UFO OBJECTS ARE FROM OUT FUTURE OR ANOTHER SOLAR SYSTEM.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

7/15/85 07:15|Greenville|VA|Disk|20 minutes|To describe the object as unbelievable is an understatement.|6/12/07|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/056/S56529.html|20|ndxe198507| I was working as a contract security officer at DAYS INN - A weekend &#34;party&#34; hotel for VMA alumni in Lexington, VA.  I worked the 11pm to 7am shift.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At 7 am approximately July 15, 1985 I got off work and headed home to Greenville VA.  It’s about a 30 minute drive north on Rt11.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At about 10 miles from home - looking to the east I saw what looked like a small skinny cloud (cigar shaped) in the orange yellow sunrise.  There were 3 or 4 small clouds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A few minutes later as I got closer to home, what I thought was a cloud grew in size and was moving east to west back to east. Upon arriving home the object was still moving east to west and back east.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I immediately woke up my parents who were still sleeping in.  I called them out to the front porch of the home we were living.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As my parents were trying to figure out what I was talking about, the object continued to move east to west back to east.  The object seemed to concentrate its path over a small minimum security work release correctional facility that is 1/2 mile directly east of our house.  Our house is on a small hill west of the correctional facility, so we had an unobstructed view.  The prison does farming and some small level cattle work (1985).  The prison has open fields on the east and west side of the property.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Almost at the moment my parents realized this was no joke and started observing this strange event themselves the object came nearly over the house and slowly rolled its belly side for us to see.  Basically went from horizontal movement to a banking position.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was so shocked I could hardly move or say anything.  To describe the object as unbelievable is an understatement.  First of all it was immense in size.  I would estimate the size somewhere between 1000 and 2000 ft in diameter.  Grey in color.  It had detail and ridges on the underside and it looked like it was intelligently built.  It was dead silent, no lights and at about 1000 ft in altitude.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The remarkable thing I did noticed from the belly view was it was trailing sparse clouds off the edges of its disk shape.  It looked much like the arms of clouds in a hurricane seen from space.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object then slowly flattened out and disappeared in the eastern horizon.  I witnessed the object for about 10 minutes in the car while driving, and about 10 minutes at home.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

We was walking through the park to gain access to the back gardens to steal garden ware.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We got to about half way through the park and climbed a 6ft fence into a back garden when i had a strange feeling like someone was watching us.  We climbed onto the fence to go back on ourselves  i jumped down to the floor back into the park but whilst i was in mid air there was a huge bright fireball hovering above the trees with no sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We walked up to the trees curiously wondering what it was i had just seen, we got to the trees and as we was looking up at the object it looked asif it was on fire. everything that was around this object was all orange from the reflection.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We then turned around to head back to the path we came off to get out of the park, Still watching our backs from the thing that we just witnessed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> From the corner of my eye i noticed a white chalk luminous human figured shape on the ground following us from behind the trees.<n> <n><n> <n><n> this was moving incredibly fast without making a sound i then said to my cousin &#39;did you just see that&#39;  he said  &#39;yes what is it&#39; i was then fascinated to what this was, so we decided to run and do a dead stop so see if it was following us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> after several  times of doing this we seen it but still didnt know what it was so we decided to draw it out into the open.<n> <n><n> <n><n> For the next half hour we kept running and coming to dead stop untill it was in the open, as the gaps between the trees got bigger we could actually see what this &#39;thing&#39; looked like.<n> <n><n> <n><n> this thing was chalk white luminous and moved incredibly fast,it had two arms, two legs and a head this looked like a human but had no features. when the sun was reflecting on its back you could see a blue outline inside the white chalk effect.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This went on untill we got to about 100 yards to the exit of the park and decided to have one last stand to get a closer look at this.  As we turned around this thing was about 300 yards behind us, within a blink of an eye it was standing right infront of us in the open in broad daylight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> what i then saw was chalk white, human figured without out any features. it then had white strobes appear out of nowhere and started spinning clockwise around it, i looked down at at mid waist of this thing and it was wearing some kind of device around it but this wasnt on top it was underneath its chalk appearance. what i called this thing it had on was a belt because i was around it waist but it had some kind of screen with black dots and dashes going from left to right in different orders. I then noticed the white strobes around this was moving faster then all of a sudden black strobes started moving anti clockwise on the inside of the white strobes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> this all lasted for a few minutes then suddenly i said to my cousin &#39;what is this&#39; and then white strobes of the figure collapsed in spinning fast.<n> <n><n> <n><n> this thing went backwards spinning towards the trees but wasnt spinning in a straight line is was zig zag then pausing in between zigzagging.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After it got back behind the first tree we decided to run towards this for one last look it had stopped spinning. It then poked what i though was its head out from behind the tree but it seemed as though it didnt care that it had been seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> me and thing then looked directly at each other for the last time and i then felt really vulnerable so me and my cousin decided to run as fast as we could to get out of this park.<n> <n><n> <n><n> throughout this whole event there was no sound coming from the object above the trees and there was no sound coming from the figure itself it was silent but incredibly fast . We thought that we was tricking this figure with running and dead stopping but all along it tricked us. if this figure wanted to harm us it could of. this figure got within 3ft of us spinning in the middle of this park.<n> <n><n> <n><n> i did not see this thing dissapear i was too busy running out the park.<n> <n><n> <n><n> i was 15yr old when this happend now i am 43 yr old and i have never seen that kind of technology before or since this event happend. i have not spoke much about this to people because people wouldnt believe me if i said it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> about a year after this had happend my cousin could not come to terms with what we had seen and had a breakdown and turned to heavy drug abuse after this noone would believe him when he told people and wasnt able to cope mentally.<n> <n><n> <n><n> where as i was just so fascinated with what i got to see and know that there are other things on this planet apart from just humans and animals.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

When I got out of the car in order to let her out of the back seat I looked up and saw a &#34;V&#34; shaped object fly in a southerly direction over the car. It had something like 6 or more round white lights indicating the shape of the infamous &#34;V&#34;. At first I thought it must be 6 helicopters flying in formation but there was no sound at all coming from the object. I have a hard time judging it&#39;s height in the sky with no frame of reference but I guess it to have been about 500&#39;. All four of us discussed what we were seeing but had no explanation of what we saw. We went on our way to drop off a second friend and on the way to his house we saw the same object still flying in a Southerly direction even though it should have already been far away if traveling at a constant speed by the time we got to the second location. We all jumped out of the car and watched it until it disappeared out of view over the distant tree line. This object was defiantly neither an airplane nor a squadron of helicopters. We still talk about the incident and still have no explanation.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((FOLLOW-UP COMMUNICATION WITH WITNESS))<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was in 1985. I remember the date vividly because I was on my way home to watch the Led Zeppelin reunion concert; the first of it&#39;s kind since Bonham died in 1980. I did however think that the concert had taken place in 1986 and always looked for other similar sightings that took place then.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Yesterday I saw an article about Live Aid and it had July 13, 1985 listed as it&#39;s date and when I crossed referenced I noticed a similar sighting nearby in NY. I wonder if there is any connection. I live in a very rural area just 15 miles outside NYC and thought that surely others must have noticed this craft flying low over their homes but was very surprised when I heard no corroborating events. I have been looking up in wonder ever since.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((END))<n>

I was in the front yard looking in my telescope.  I suddenly noticed a large &#34;Fireball&#34; in the southern sky headed westward (it was so large it wasn&#39;t moving).  I ran in the house to get my parents  to come outside to see it.  Within 15 seconds we were outside, but my dad looked straight up and as I was about to tell him to look in the southern sky I looked up and saw an object I still can&#39;t believe.  The Triangle object was huge and was over our heads in a northeast direction.  It moved slowly and made no noise.  It had some type of gaseous clouds in it and had some types of starry lights in it.  When I say &#34;in it&#34;, I mean you could see through it as it was pure black (not metallic).  But it was definitely a triangle object and as it traveled northeast, we could still see it about 2 miles away as it traveled over the phosphate mine.  My aunt was hanging up clothes and yelled down to us &#34;What is it, What is that?&#34;  We yelled back &#34;We don&#39;t know!&#34;  I called the local radio station and they said many people called in about the fiery object I saw and they said it was simply a fallen satellite.  I agree that it was a fallen satellite in the south because I&#39;ve seen those before, but what we saw 20 years ago I can&#39;t explain.  Whatever it was, it had something to do with the fallen satellite.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.  PD))<n>

I was just a kid from a rather conservative and religious family, who didn&#39;t give much thought or attention to things outside of the normal daily routine.  I had a friend who witnessed the event with me, my next door neighbor, ((name deleted)).  She was three years younger than myself.  We were outside in the early evening playing catch the sun had just set.  The lights from the dead end street we lived on put a soft light on her yard which was next to the field.  She threw the ball up into the air, and when I looked up to get a good position on the ball I noticed a formation of helicopters traveling in a southeastern formation.  I counted six or so, which were making fast progress, in single file.  The ball hit the ground.  I commented how strange it was to see that many helicopters traveling together and in that formation when we both heard a rather deep pulsating noise which made us both look toward the field.  I yelled, &#34;hey, ((name deleted)), common!&#34; and we both ran toward the edge of the field which was just between her house and the beginning of the first row of maple and birch trees.  There it was.  In a word, huge.  I had the impression that if it were on the ground, it would be the size of two houses.  I have often wondered how high the object was off the ground and if it were larger than that, but it sounded like it was close to us based on the volume of the thing.  The noise could be described as a vibration that came in and out of the audible range ... I could feel it in my stomach.  It had a strange echo or reverb which was peculiar to my ears.  The object was a long triangle and had absolutely no features to be distingushed apart from its lights.  I observed it as a very smooth and completely black object against a dark blue night sky.  There were no wings and I could see no jet intakes, hover vents, or anything which would explain its motion ... indeed it appeared to be floating very slowly maybe 100 ft above the treeline.  The trees it seemed to be over were not impacted or moved by the object like a helicopter or hover plane would produce.  The object appeared to be moving west, slightly to the south.  It gave me the impression of something ducking behind cover and waiting for the coast to clear.  Unless it was a sharply angled triangular blimp, it had no means by which I could determine it staying airborne.  I expect I was looking at the bottom of the object, except that the angle it was moving up and westward made me think it was the side of the object.  There were two series of lights, 5 running its length (on either side, or top and bottom depending on your perspective).  Each light in the row was a different color, but corresponded to the row of ligts on the other side.  Red, Green, Yellow, Blue, White. (not sure about the order).  I wanted to get a better view of the object, and began running to get a better position to observe before it moved out of our visual range due to our low obervation ground and all the tall objects around us (houses and trees) when it vanished.  No flash, to streak, no change in noise volume ... it just stopped being there.  It changed my worldview forever.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

PD))<n> <n><n> <n><n> Close Encounter With Aliens and a UFO<n> <n><n> <n><n> What I am about to tell you will sound amazing but what i will tell you is total true.  When I was about 6 years old I went on a capming trip with my Dad to the Yosemite Forest in the summer.  On the last night of our stay I was outside eating while my dad was asleep when i heard a nose like no animal coulds have made.  It was a loud humming sound.  I thought it was a car engine but it didn&#39;t stop.  I then took my flash light and went out to find the sound, being the little dectivce I was back then.  It took me about 25 to 30 minutes to arrive at the source of the sound.  I was looking over the side of a hill and saw it about 30 feet below me, a egg shaped UFO.  Needless to say I was shocked!  It seem to be about 40 feet wide and 60 feet long.  It had strange colored lights coming out of what seemed to be windows and a opened door of some sort?  There was a odd mist coming from below  it that was yellow in color and the sound seemed to be coming from that area, I suposes it was the vent from the engine of the UFO and the source of the sounds I was hearing.  I then looked over the object and then was able to see to my astonishement 3 Greys!  They where about 3 feet tall, very skiny bodies, oval heads with black eyes, 3 very long fingers on there hands.  I was one of them, that I now believe must hav been he leader ativate some sort of silver sphere in its hand.  The sphere then lifted off the grey&#39;s hand and hovered near a dead Ox and then shots out a red ray and started to cut the Ox open.  I then started to get very scared and back away as I did a rock feel off the hill and hit the top of the ship leaving no dent, but the 3 greys look at me.  I will never forget how dark they eyes are, it seemed like the where looking right into my soul.  I then ran as fast as I could away.  I got lost in the woods and as I stopped to take a rest I heard foot steps!  I then his inside a hollowed out red wood tree.  I cryed and prayed whatever was out there would just leave me alone.  As I hid I heard no! ses that I still to this day no not  to be human or animal could make.  The next morning I was found by A hicker and his family.<n>

My wife, my late mother-in-law and my two children along with myself were sitting on the dock fishing at Lake Sinclair. It was very dark and quiet. We had the light off on the dock so the bugs would not bother us. We were having a peaceful time when we all noticed that several lights were coming toward us out over the water. They did not seem to be on the lake but above the lake about 20 to 30 feet or more. There was a light in front and several different color lights that seemed to following the one in front. It did not make any noise. The lights did not all move at the same time but seemed to move in a chain like formation. The one in front moved and the others would then follow it. My wife said, &#34;What is that?&#34; I said joking that it was a UFO. The children were so frightened they clung to my wife and my mother-in-law. I thought it was a boat coming toward us. The lights continued slowly coming toward us. I also became frightened but I didn&#39;t let my family know. I thought it was going to continue directly toward us. I wanted to get up and run off the dock but was so shocked I couldn&#39;t move. When the lights were about a hundred feet or so from the dock they turned slowly and went up over the trees and we did not see them again. We turned to the TV to see if there was any reports about what we saw but we didn&#39;t hear anything. We have only told a few people about what we saw that night. I knew people would think we were making it up. I have worked for a manufacturing company for over 40 years and I served in the Army during the Vietnam War. I have never witnessed anything like that before and have never seen anything like that since. There may be an explanation for what we saw that night but I do not have one.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.  PD))<n>

So common sense and logics are the things I use for the most things of my life. I dont do drugs or any other thing that could cause hallucinations.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It is very hot this time a year in Belgium. So like I do more, I open the windows ( 1 roof window, 3 normal windows ) the let cool air come in.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This event happened at 4.30 ( was still kinda dark ). So that is from now 90 min ago.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was sleeping and I was dreaming. Nothing special... suddenly I hear a kind of hovering, god how can I describe it ehm Its like: mix the sound of bubbling water with a sort of hovering sound into it. I cant say it more clearly :s ( eng isnt my native language )  The thing is I woke up from this sound, it was not in my dream. I opened my eyes and before I realized that I was awake and looking I saw something near my bed ( floating , hovering but without reshaping the surroundings through air, like you see with a vehicle moved by air ).<n> <n><n> <n><n> I get a bit scared while I am typing this ( bring back the memory rather lively ) but I need to tell, type it to let it out of my system.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was a bit bigger then a tennisball and it was making that hovering / floating / bubbling water sound just about a meter from my face. I coudnt see it very detailed. It gave a strong light green light on the surroundings. In a split second when the &#34; item &#34; noticed I was awake it moved in a ( like you see in spiral movements of comets etc ) such way past my door ( that was open ) to the right through the open roof window. ( what was open also ).<n> <n><n> <n><n> I coudnt believe what I saw and was sure I was still asleep. But how longer I waited and tryed to explain this in reasoning how more aware I was of the fact I was awake ( I pinched myself in the arm, I felt pain, as far as I know you cant imitate that in a dream ) The next 20 min I was more or less paralyzed with fear and trying to explain what I just saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Only &#34; logical &#34; thing I can analyze out of this experience is that I was dreaming when that &#34; item &#34; was near me. I will not make further conclusions cause those would only be based on stuff you see on tv smile.gif Like aliens of outer space only explore human life and how they their way of life is by scanning and analyzing the memories of peeps who are in REM state of sleep. ( would make sense cause this way its highly unlikely you could have been caught.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I still got goosebumps when I think of my experience (less fear). I am not sure how to process this experience. But I feel a bit relieved that I could write this post. I even took my drink of last night out of the garbage to see if it could cause any hallucinations or any other reason for seeing wat I have seen... I know it can be medical explained when you feel paranoid or similar but this ....<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date may be approximate, although the witness does not indicate that fact.

It had been raining off and on most of the night. A squall had just passed and we were settling down for another half hour of sleep before the next squall came through. My wife, in a very excited voice said to me &#34;what are those lights.&#34; I would like to say that the next thing we knew it was July 10th, and we could not account for the last five days, but what I saw was 3 very bright green lights in a triangle pattern, with a light at each point. They were moving very rapidly from South to North at eye level. There was no sound.  They were in view for about 10 seconds and dissapeared from view. I don&#39;t think an aircraft would be flying on the deck under those conditions, wind shear, and a boat could not go that fast. The green light was so bright it left a retnal print in our vision for several minutes.  I was working as a Telescope Operator on Mauna Kea at the time.  I have seen many strange lights on Mauna Kea in the 15 years I worked there,  but can usually explain them away.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

All of a sudden my One friend started to call out my name. I was starting to doze off and ignored his calls at first, until the tone of his voice went frantic. I jumped up and ran outside. The object was clearly visable between my house and the Indian Point Nuclear Power Plant. The object was an Orange colored translucent Tiangle. It almost seemed to be stuck or frozen. It was emitting a high pitched whooshing sound. My One young friend started to jump up and down and yell &#34;take me,take me&#34; at which point the object seemed to come closer. I distinctly felt menaced and started to cower toward the house. The object then made a 360 degree circle out over the river and then disappeared over the tree line to the East.<n>

I believe it was around 3:00 p.m., and we|3/13/12|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/087/S87538.html|35|ndxe198507| On July 4, 1985, my ex-husband and I took our kids to the Land Between the Lakes in Kentucky.  I believe it was around 3:00 p.m., and we had turned off of The Trace onto the Silver Trail Road, headed toward the Woodlands Nature Center.  We had packed a picnic basket and planned to spend the afternoon at LBL and stay to watch the fireworks over the lake later that evening.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was a beautiful, sunny day with hardly a cloud in the sky. My husband was driving and I was in the front passenger seat.  As I leaned back in my seat I noticed some jet vapor trails in the sky, and I visually followed the one that looked the freshest (winds had not yet dispersed the vapor).  I remember thinking to myself, &#34;That&#39;s a strange-looking jet.&#34;  Then I realized that what I had first seen was not a jet but a UFo that was flying alongside the much-smaller triangular-shaped military jet.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The UFO was white in color and I could not make out any surface features.  It was what one would describe as cigar-shaped I suppose, but to me the shape was more like a Luden&#39;s cough drop.  It was about three times the length of the jet and twice the width of the jet at its widest point.  I told my husband, &#34;There&#39;s a UFO! Pull over!&#34;  He didn&#39;t see it and I kept losing sight of it because of all the trees.  Before he could find a spot to pull over, I saw the UFO suddenly take off at about a 45 degree angle at an incredibly high rate of speed.  It got smaller and smaller and disapperaed from my sight in about two-three seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I don&#39;t know what altitude the UFO and jet were flying at but when I held my hand up to compare it to the size of the UFO, the UFo was about the length of the fingernail on my pinky finger and about half the width of that fingernail. (I keep my nails trimmed short.)   That was over 26 years ago and I have never forgotten it. At that time I didn&#39;t know how or where to report a UFO sighting and, in fact, had never believed in UFo&#39;s until I saw one for myself.  So, why report it now, after all these years? Well&gt; I was just watching a program about UFO&#39;s on television and I decided to do an internet search to see if anyone else had reported seeing the same UFO on that date.  (That&#39;s how I found this website.) I didn&#39;t find any other reports like mine but I hope that by telling my story, someone else who saw it will come forth.  I know for sure that at least one other person saw the UFo - the jet pilot, and I&#39;m sure he would have reported it to his superiors.<n>
7/1/85 22:00|Great Neck|NY|Rectangle|10 minutes|Giant UFO sighting on Long Island in the mid 1980's|7/17/11|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/082/S82512.html|36|ndxe198507| Giant UFO sighting on Long Island in the mid 1980&#39;s<n> <n><n> <n><n> On a warm, clear summer night my husband and I were driving on the Grand Central Parkway preparing to exit onto the Cross Island Expressway on our way back to Manhattan from our Long Island vacation home.  We had a car called an AMC Pacer, which had a very large moon roof.  I was fully reclined in the passenger seat looking at the stars.  Suddenly I noticed the stars were blocked by an object and replaced by a series of illuminated dark gray tubes and small white lights.  Having no idea what this was I rolled my window all the way down and popped my head outside the window to get a better look.<n> <n><n> <n><n> To my complete shock, an enormous gunmetal gray object hovered overhead, no more than 150 feet up.  It looked like it was rectangular or at least angular in some way, it had sharp edges and corners, at least on the side I could see, since it was so large, at least the size of a football field.  Its underside was gunmetal gray with a touch of green, it had a utilitarian, military feel to it.  The snake-like tubes running along its underside were illuminated by a series of small white lights, like clear Christmas lights, and the object was surrounded by a subtle glow, like an aura. It was almost completely silent, but I did detect a tiny hum, and it glided very smoothly overhead, at approximately the speed of our car, which was probably about 35 - 40 miles per hour.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were on a heavily populated highway in a dense residential area, with a lot of businesses and street lights.  I looked around me and no one seemed to be looking up but me, there was no shouting, no blinking of horns one might think would accompany such an anomaly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I stammered to my husband to look up, he did, muttered &#34;Uh huh&#34; and kept driving as if I had pointed out a full moon.  &#34;Is everyone asleep?&#34; I wondered, and I kept up a steady patter about the object as we turned onto the Cross Island and I could no longer track it.  When we arrived home at our Manhattan apartment (I worked as a copywriter in those days, my husband was an advertising art director) I turned on the TV fully expecting to see breaking news about the giant object, but there was nothing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The next day my husband pointed out an article in the New York Times (an inside page)about UFO sightings in the Hudson Valley that same evening.  &#34;Ah hah!&#34; I said, feeling vindicated, but there was nothing further about it.  It did spark my interest in the subject though, and after this experience I read a great deal about UFOs and hoped maybe one day I would experience another sighting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I did have the distinct impression during this sighting that we were being surveyed and watched by this object, it felt ponderous and powerful, and 25 years later I remember it as if it happened yesterday.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  We spoke via telephone with this witness, and we found her to be quite objective and eloquent in her description of two sightings.  We suspect that she is an excellent witness.

Moments later, two helicopters from Los Alamitos Air Force Reserve Center, circled area and moved off in same direction as object.  Contacted AFRC later and they denied any sightings.  Contacted Seal Beach Naval Weapons Station with info.  They called back and taped description of sighting.  Said that I had seen something and verified that their guys had seen it too.

We were watching TV during the summer, at dusk, in my parents bedroom.  The bedroom is on the upper level of the house and completely walled with windows. I saw a HUGE SAUCER-SHAPED UFO slowly spinning with red and yellow flashing lights out the window.  We sprang off the bed to get a closer look out of the window.  It was slowly lowering straight down behind the house and trees on the other side of the small pond in our backyard. It was the same width as the house it was hovering by, so I know it was actually bigger than the house being that it was &#34;landing&#34; behind it in the empty field of what has now been developed into the &#34;Stonegate&#34; subdivision.  We were so excited and ran out to the landing to look down into the living room to tell our folks to get up and go see the &#34;flying saucer&#34; outside.  But Mom was asleep on the couch and Dad promptly blew us off with a wave of his hand in disbelief.  We ran back into the bedroom to keep watching, but the UFO had either landed out of sight or had gone.  I&#39;ve told a few people over the years and my sister has forgotten for the most part I think.  It&#39;s burned into my memory forever.<n>
