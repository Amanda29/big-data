At first we thought it was someone with a flashlight playing games, but we crouched down and could see that it was well above the tree line and was moving very fast ,,,so fast at times that we could not follow it until it stopped.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It would move in 90 degree angles without stopping or just shoot across the sky at an extremely fast rate.  This lasted for about 5 minutes then it just disappeared. This was the first one we saw but saw another much later,in the 70&#39;s.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I will enter that sighting separately and also another sighting a girlfriend and I saw in the 90&#39;s.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

7/20/59 21:30|Fort Lauderdale|FL|Light|2-3 minutes|Two lights like strs converging upwad becoming "one".|8/5/01|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/018/S18750.html|2|ndxe195907| Two lights like strs converging upwad becoming &#34;one&#34;.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is a more accurat dating of the event reportd earlier today which occurred many years ago. On Septembr 11 1959 we had hurrican awnings installed on many windows including the west window through which I observed the two  lights which I thought were stars conerging upward. Thus the date o occurrence would have been in 1958 or 1959 as one can no  longer see the sky from these windows with hurricane awnings. I wrote Isaac Asimov and Woodbury aftr the event after reading their books.<n>
7/19/59 01:00|Salem|OH|Disk|hour|1959 Saucers-huge- pattern of four shifting high in Ohio skies-white-yellow perfectly formed-moving very fast|4/16/05|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/042/S42407.html|3|ndxe195907| 1959 Saucers-huge- pattern of four shifting high in Ohio skies-white-yellow perfectly formed-moving very fast<n> <n><n> <n><n> My younger sister woke me up probably after midnight. She told me to look out the side bedroom window which was to the left of the bed we slept in. My other baby sister remained asleep in her big crib in the opposite corner of the room. I rolled over onto my left side to glimpse outside the bedroom window.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was a warm summer&#39;s evening, the sky was clear but I do not remember any moon. The view was looking down the street we lived on. There was an old buckeye tree in the front yard of our neighbors house [across the street] 4 houses down. My sister pointed into the sky, saying to look above the buckeye tree. There was no way I could miss it. Four huge white-yellow glowing saucers were hoover above the tree, but at a great distance. I can only say [as I was a young child] that they were higher up than any planes we saw flying [up at Pittsburgh airport].<n> <n><n> <n><n> My sister &amp; I leaned on our elbows and just &#39;gazed&#39; out the window at this amazing sight. The &#39;saucers&#39; moved perfectly together in a pattern of four like on dominoes, up, down, sideways but never out of our view. It seemed like this went on for a very long time. We felt the saucers themselves must have been going around in circles[rotating] at great speed because we could see a faint halo towards the middle, fatter part of the saucer. We did not see any windows or flashing lights. They were huge and perfectly formed, not like clouds in any way.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Suddenly, they moved/shifted upwards then, at what must have been an incredible speed,  in a direction away from Earth or at least away from us or from our view...they moved so fast as to disappear from our view within seconds of shifting upwards. We both looked at each in disbelief! During this episode, the objects always remained in a perfect pattern of 4 even as they disappeared from view. We told our mother the next day [we stayed quiet as to not wake baby sister and be told off] she told us we were imagining things. Back then, we told very few people as it was weird that no one seemed to believe us or just said nothing.?? So, we just accepted that we must have seen &#39;flying saucers&#39;[UFO&#39;s] from outspace because we heard stories about such things. And, no other explanation fits.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My sister and I still agree on this sighting. Had we been older and had a more curious mother, we may have discovered others who witnessed a similar siting at the time. The exact date and time I am not sure of, but I will never forget seeing something moving profoundly fast and in formation with an intelligence unlike that of anything on Earth up in the skies of Ohio.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have had 2 other experience since then. I think once something like this happens to you, you have an altered perception of reality and begin to think more laterally.<n> <n><n> <n><n> One was a falling star which split in two as it fell. My husband and I witnessed that in England back in 1986. A rare sighting, I think, but explained.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The other was a bright pulsating light I witnessed in the Andes at Macchu Piccu in 1974. This light was again a white-yellowish color. It pulsated light [rhythmic like a heartbeat]. Somehow it woke me up that night. I think it could have been the odd low-level noise it made.  I can only describe the sound as a &#39;low-pitched&#39; single sound of a gyrating quality. That, and the pulsating light filling up my rear hotel bedroom window had me frozen with fear.  Though I could look out the back window, only light was coming in. I could not &#39;see&#39; anything. Strangely, after watching this for what seemed a long time, I must have fallen asleep. Next morning when I looked out the back window, there was nothing to see but a steep wall of rock behind the hotel.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Very early in the evening the hotel shuts off its electricity. There is nothing above the hotel except a small mountain path. I hiked up the mountain/cliff behind the hotel to see if I could discover where the light source was coming from. Nothing.  The path cast a view across to the temple of the Sun at MP. Make your own conclusions. The only other view is the mountain tops of the Andes and huge butterflies.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I heard the mountains produce their own eeries lights. I met another person who also saw what I did that night. He was from Austrialia-doing oil exploration down in the Amazon Basin. We just could not figure it out, as nothing was up there [too high for helicopters in the night, moonless night?] but the hotel and us. The hoteliers saw nothing and said nothing is up there, could be no light, no electricity.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It is so dark up there at night that when the electricity is turned off that I could not see my hand even when I placed flat against my nose. That is dark! But, something lit up MP that night. I will never know what it was.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of sighting is approximate.  PD))<n>

I could see it was sort of shiny and some sort of light coming from it but not sure where from .I assumed some sort of light because i could see it clearly. It was hovering above the tree line which was about 1or 2 miles from my house. I was stunned . I had never seen anything like it and never have again .<n> <n><n> <n><n> The next day the paper reported that something had been sighted but gave no explanation of what it was. The principal of the Catholic school was another witness  and an older lady who lived about 5 miles from me.

He was the head of police office in Alor islands area when it happened.<n> <n><n> <n><n> He said there were six aliens who came to the area.  They have long arms, wavy silver-color-hair, and some of them have beard.  They wore blue clothes with high collar, belt with some gray cylindric stick and shoes that look like black military boot.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Some inhabitants said that they searched for something.  A report said that a six-year-old kid was kidnapped and be returned in confuse in some field area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Finally, some policemen waited and soon met with them.  The police then shooted them (around 13 metres at distance) but they realized none of them were bleed, nor dead body found.  It was strange because the police shooted them in a very near distance.  The police only found some trees were fall down and some footprints which ended in around five metres and then disappear.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After the incident, some inhabitants reported that they saw an oval white-glowing unidentified flying object flew fast over the sea. The object flew from west to east.<n> <n><n> <n><n> [Source: Salatun, J. (1982). UFO: Salah Satu Masalah Dunia Masa Kini {UFO: One of World Problem in Present Day).

7/7/59 23:00|Long Beach|CA|Light|45 seconds|As a young man, I would lay out in the yard at night and look at the sky--I often saw an object moving at night speed, very high, no no|4/26/00|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/012/S12670.html|8|ndxe195907| As a young man, I would lay out in the yard at night and look at the sky--I often saw an object moving at night speed, very high, no noise, moving from north to south, right along the coast.  I saw this often, as in several times.  It was a steady light (smallish in size)--didn&#39;t move fast enough for a shooting star, but was steady--before Sputnik!<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I stated above, the object was like a high flying airplane that you would see nowdays, except the entirety of it was lighted.  I lived on the Alamitos Bay Penninsula, just south of Long Beach, California.  The objects were always by themselves and always moved from the north to the south--you see a shooting star for a second or two and then it disappears--these went from horizon to horizon--never at any set time, but I could always count on seeing them late at night--my binoculars 7X50 didn&#39;t do anything to enhance what I was seeing--I could see only the light, which was whitish in color.  That is about it.  I don&#39;t need to be called, but if anyone wanted to discuss it further, I would be happy to.<n>

Object flew down from behind us in a desent entering our field of view. We wached it fly very low and slowly all the way across Gardner Lake. When it reached the other side it stopped and hovered for a few minutes next it desended to the groung and landed. We could still see the light from it shinning through the Pine trees at night. After sitting on the groung for a few minutes it next began to rise back up to its original altitude and hovered for a few more minutes. Next it began to move towards the SE. Its rate of acceleration seemed to increase very rapidly, so much so after a few ( may be 10 sec ) it was traveling like a bulet. It disapeared going off in the SE.<n>

We shared a single bedroom and my bed sat against the rear wall of the house off to one side of the bunk beds where my brothers slept. The windows were wide and narrow and high up near the ceiling. As my mother knelt down to kiss me good night, her attention was suddenly diverted by something that caught her eye as she glanced up through the window. Her face grew very serious then paled and her expression faded from curiosity to astonishment and then fear. Her expression frightened me and she failed to respond when I asked her what was wrong several times. I was afraid to look out the window myself because of the fear I saw in my mother’s face.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The following morning she told me she had looked out the window into the darkness just as a very large cigar-shaped silhouette glided silently into her view from her right (east), barely clearing the tops of the eighty-foot fir trees in the forest that began fifty yards behind our house. She said that she first thought she was witnessing a passenger airliner about to crash but then realized it was moving so slowly that it was nearly hovering and that there was absolutely no engine noise. She thought this was odd, because it was so close she thought she should be hearing something. She said as the object passed her field of view, she could see windows glowing with yellow light spaced evenly along the sides and even thought she may have caught a quick glimpse of dark humanoid shadows in one or two of the windows. She said it reminded her of watching a nearby passenger train passing in the night. She continued staring out the window for several seconds after the object drifted out of view, expecting to hear a crash somewhere nearby, but there was no such sound and that confused her even more.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My mother called the radio station the following morning and reported what she’d seen. The man she talked to said they had received dozens of similar reports from all around the area and that her sighting appeared to be where the sightings first began coming in. He told her the UFO had been tracked on radar across Oregon and into California where it turned west and then disappeared off the screen over the ocean at a very high rate of speed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> End of report.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We have met with this individual, and he seems to us to exceptionally serious-minded, and and exceptionally good witness.

I was camping in the back yard with 2 friends. Sometime during early morning with a full moom I woke up and I was already sitting up. The sky was clear and lit up by the full moon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was looking south at same time I woke up a disk shaped object was moving eastward in the sky approx 450 yds high and approx 200 yds away from me its size was approx. 1800 sp ft. disk shaped with a dome with what I thought were windows at the time with bright yellow light coming from the windows  ( I have since determined that the windows were heat vents and the yellow light was a high voltage} It was gold in color and at a 45 degree angle. Now here is what really caught my attention. Out of the bottom (which I could not see) came out 2 different color ( I thought) plasmas one gold or copper and one green around the edges of the plasmas (big blob shape) were looked like roots of trees on both blobs I could see thru each of them they pulsated in opposite resonances for approx 1 minute then stopped the disk shot away at remarkable speed at the 45 degree angle (in the blink of an eye)  Since I was 12 yrs old grew up on a farm I had no idea what that thing was nor did I know what a space ship was, but that has stuck in my mind for years  I have since discovered that the green plasma ( I thought) was in fact the same as happens at the north pole with the lights   a photon or free eletron is traveling and come in contact with a strong magnetic fields flux line and is speeded up and becomes a fast photon or electron and hits an oxygen atom and gives up a green color which is visiable   the copper color I have not figured out yet but must be a secondary electron transfer  since I suppose the ship was charging itself someway. It made no sound I have not told but a few about this thanks<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  Witness is retired.
