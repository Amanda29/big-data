The stars began to disappear behind some object.  There was no sound.   The shape, as determined by the disappearing stars, was like a triangle with two booms (like the old P-38) off the ends.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first, we thought it was just some kind of low-flying aircraft, but, with no sound, we decided that it might be flying very high.  If so, it had to be enormous.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We did not report it because we felt people would think we were nuts.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.

6/30/90 20:30|Scottsdale|AZ|Triangle|10 MINUTES|PHOENIX LIGHT OVER SCOTTSDALE IN 1991|5/15/06|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/049/S49840.html|2|ndxe199006| PHOENIX LIGHT OVER SCOTTSDALE IN 1991<n> <n><n> <n><n> I HAVE WITHOUT A DOUBT &amp; SWEAR ON MY LIFE &amp; THE LIFE OF MY FAMILY, THAT I TOO HAVE SEEN THESE LIGHTS AND IT CHILLS ME EVERYTIME I SEE A REPORTING ABOUT THEM.  THE ONLY DIFFERENCE TO MY STORY IS THAT THE DATE THAT I HAVE SEEN THEM IS ABOUT 4 YEARS PRIOR TO YOUR SIGHTING.  I HAVE SEARCHED FOR DATES ONLINE BUT HAVE SEEN NOTHING DURING THIS TIME.  NOW AS A RESULT OF MY FINDINGS, I FEEL LIKE I NEED TO TELL SOMEBODY.  I JUST CANT BELIEVE NOBODY ELSE HAS REPORTED THESE LIGHTS DURING THAT TIME PERIOD BECAUSE WHAT I SAW WAS ENORMOUS! HOW COULD ANYBODY MISS IT?  CURRENTLY, I RESIDE IN SARASOTA, FLORIDA, BUT FOR A BRIEF TIME, FROM 1990-1991, I LIVED IN SCOTTSDALE, AZ.  AND FROM 1992 TO 2004 I LIVED IN THE FAR NORTH SUBURBS OF CHICAGO.  I WAS AT THE CORNER OF SCOTTSDALE ROAD AND E. SHEA BLVD. AT THE NE CORNER OF THE INTERSECTION IS/WAS A &#34;MOBILE&#34;  ((sic.  Mobil)) GAS STATION.  WHILE I WAS FILLING UP MY CAR WITH GAS, I SAW THESE RED LIGHTS IN A SOUTHERLY DIRECTION FROM WHERE I WAS STANDING IN A &#34;V&#34; SHAPE IN WHAT LOOKED VERY CLOSE AND MOVING VERY SLOWLY!!! BECAUSE THE AREA SITS AT SORT OF A HIGHER ELEVATION OVERLOOKING THE PHOENIX, TEMPE &amp; MESA AREAS, THE LIGHTS SEEMED ALMOST EYE LEVEL.  YOU DID LOOK UP SLIGHTLY BUT THESE LIGHTS SEEMED NO MORE THAN ABOUT 1 MILE AWAY IN DISTANCE AND WHAT SEEMED TO BE ABOUT A HALF A MILE LONG OR LONGER IN SIZE.  THE OBJECT MOVED IN AN EASTERLY DIRECTION AND MADE ABSOLUTELY NO SOUND WHAT-SO-EVER. THE FACT THAT IT HAD NO SOUND IS WHAT CAUGHT MY ATTENTION.  I HAVE HEARD THE MENTION OF AMBER LIGHTS, WHICH I DON’T BELIEVE IS WHAT I SAW.  I BELIEVE I SAW RED LIGHTS.  ALSO, I HAVE HEARD THE MENTION OF FLARES. THAT IS ABSOLUTELY NOT WHAT I SAW.  THIS MAINTAINED A CONSTANT ELEVATION IN A VERY SLOW EASTERLY DIRECTION.  I WAS IN SO MUCH DISBELIEF THAT I DIDN’T HEAR ANYBODY ELSE AROUND ME MAKING COMMENTS THAT I HAD TO ASK AN OLDER GENTLEMAN, WHOME WAS WALKING OUT OF THE GAS STATION AFTER PAYING I ASSUME, IF HE KNEW WHAT THOSE LIGHTS WERE.  HE DID SORT OF A DOUBLE TAKE, ANSWERED, &#34;I DON’T KNOW,&#34; PROCEEDED TO GET IN HIS CAR STARING AT THE LIGHTS AND DROVE OFF. I WAS ABOUT 23 YEARS OLD AT THE TIME, AND I REMEMBER THINKING, &#34;WELL IF HE DIDN’T THINK IT WAS ANY BIG DEAL, THEN IT MUST NOT BE,&#34; SO I PROCEEDED TO GET IN MY CAR AND LEAVE TO GO TO MY GIRLFRIENDS HOUSE AT THE TIME IN MCCORMICK RANCH.  I THINK I KEPT AN EYE ON THE LIGHTS FOR A WHILE AS I WAS DRIVING BUT AFTER THAT I CAN’T REMEMBER WHEN I STOPPED LOOKING.  I REMEMBER TELLING MY GIRLFRIEND ABOUT IT WHEN I WALKED IN HER HOUSE AND SHE CHANGED THE SUBJECT AND I NEVER SEEN ANYTHING ON THE NEWS THAT EVENING ABOUT IT, SO IT WAS FORGOTTEN UNTIL ABOUT 1997 WHEN I SAW THE FIRST REPORTS OF THE LIGHTS ON TELEVISION.  I REMEMBER SEEING THE REPORTS FOR THE FIRST TIME AND FEELING THE HAIR STAND UP ON THE BACK OF MY NECK. I WONDERED, &#34;NOW HOW DO I TELL SOMEBODY MY STORY WITHOUT THEM THINKING THAT I AM NUTS?&#34;  WELL, I NEVER TALKED ABOUT IT MUCH BUT, I TOLD MY FUTURE WIFE AND I RECEIVED THE TYPICAL RESPONSE I GUESS ANY CRACK POT MIGHT GET, &#34;OH, COOL OR THAT’S NICE.&#34;  SO AGAIN, I PUSHED IT ASIDE.  BUT IT IS REALLY EATING AT ME NOW TO TELL SOMEBODY.  SO HERE I AM.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I AM NOT LOOKING FOR ANY FINANCIAL GAIN OR RECOGNITION.  I JUST WANTED AN EAR TO HEAR MY SIDE.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.  We have assigned an artificial date above.  PD))<n>

It was at what appeared to be very high altitude.  I could see shadowing with some contrast,it remained stationary for about four hours.  There were two other people who observed it. I was able to look at it with a pair of field glasses while laying on my back.  This thing was in some sort of geo sync. I watched it untill it faded from view due to diminishing daylight.  It never moved, it remained fixed in one position above my location.  It slowly faded from view while never moving.  Again it appeared to remain at a stationary point, but must have been in the atmosphere at high altitude because as daylight waned it slowly faded with the approaching dusk<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

Me and my neighbor (around 14 at the time walking trough his covered garage on the side of the house.  We look left over the 5ft wall and spot in 600 yards away a &#34;trash can&#34; silver object, with two black ends tumbling flawlessly horizontally on the sky, with a speed of maybe 35 mph between some buildings.  It should be at an altitude of  a 17th floor almost.  We gazed the object for around 12 seconds until it vanished through the buldings and that was enough to tell that was no balloon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Despite the odd shape the object seems very light and in harmony, with some proper timing in the tumbling flying style.  My friend brother was an AFA cadet( air force academy in Brazil) at the time and we are really into aircrafts.  That was definitely not a conventional way to fly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 24 years later and I still have that clear image in my mind..

I was spending the night at a freinds house and we were going fishing or something the next morning so i spent the night at this freinds house.  But we went to bed kinda early.  Well i woke up from a deep sleep, it was like something woke me up.  I was sleeping next to the window and something said look out the window.  So i pulled the curtain, i opened the curtain and there was the craft at about tree top hight.  I had to rub my eyes to see if i was dreaming and it was still there.  Now i know for a fact that it was not a plane or anthing because it was round and all the lights that were not blinking.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

My brother was watching TV and I was in my room playing my saga.  When my mom comes in and asks me to come in to the kitchen to look out the window.  So, I did and saw this disk glowing just over the tree line.  We watched it for about 20 minutes then my mom grabs her camera snaps off a whole fresh roll of 32 photos.  The object took off or cloaked after the flash went off about the 14th time.  But my mom still shoot  the hole roll.  The next day she went to get the film developed.  She sent it out  on a 3-5 day ticket it took a month to get the film back and when she did  the photos were blank  not a single shot came out.  I’ve shared this story many times and heard you on Clyde Lewis and felt this should be brought to you for documentation.<n>

6/20/90 01:00|Bremerton|WA|Triangle|20 seconds|blazed along tree line then dissapeared.|2/11/03|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/027/S27455.html|12|ndxe199006| blazed along tree line then dissapeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A friend and I were talking, leaning against my car late one summer night. The crickets were out and chirping. For some reason we both stopped talking and a huge light in a triangle shape caught our eye. It was real dark except for a couple house lights on. It was over the tree line, not sure of distance, and it moved very slowly, what I would guess as about 20 to 40 MPH. The crickets stopped chirping as this thing moved. I could hear a faint &#34;crackling&#34; noise as it moved. There was no other sound as This is a secluded area. We held our breath as this thing reached a spot in the sky and rocketed at about a 75 degree angle out of sight, it did leave a faint light trail that lasted half a second or so and then was gone. We thought it may have been over the bangor sub base. If it was it was farther away than I thought and had to have been very large to have been that visable. A very unreal experiance and no one believes me.  I dont know what I saw but I do know that humans do not have that kind of capability, no airplane flies that slow with no noise then dissapears that quickly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

6/17/90 20:30|Kettering|OH|Other|15 minutes|Flying object shaped like a pagoda flew over  neighborhood trees and homes.|9/2/05|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/045/S45301.html|13|ndxe199006| Flying object shaped like a pagoda flew over  neighborhood trees and homes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The sky was hazy and white to light gray. Temperature was about 75 degrees Fahrenheit. It was a pleasant day. I was cutting small branches off of my pine trees which sit on either side of my sloping driveway. As I looked up and to my left I saw a large object flying over the street. The object was banking hard to the right. Very strongly and quite loudly I shouted:&#34;What the hell is that, what the hell is that, what the hell is that?&#34; I dropped my shears and ran diagonally across the street to the space between the houses. The object was still banking very hard to its right and flew across the street to my left and over a house to my left. It was at an altitude of about 60 feet and moving slowly right above the tree tops. I arrived between the two houses across the street just as the object was directly behind the houses and flying parallel to the houses. At this point the object was almost overhead. The object was light brown with some black shading. The object was approximately 7 to 8 feet wide at the bottom and five feet wide at the top. The object was approximately 12 to 13 feet tall. The object made no sound. There were no lights on the object. There were no markings. There were two tubes coming out of the bottom of the object. These tubes were approximately four feet long. One tube was straight. The other tube was straight and then kinked at about 45 degrees three feet from the bottom of the object. The tubes were about 1 to 1.5 inches in diameter. The object seemed to be covered with scales or tiles and you could see through the object near the top, about 12 inches from the top.<n> <n><n> <n><n> By this time I called very loudly for my wife. She came outside. I was across the street between the two houses and told her to go and get my binoculars (7x50). She returned a minute later and said she could not find my binoculars. Very determined I said to her, &#34;Go find my binoculars.&#34;  Finally my wife came running across the street with my binoculars. I ran back to the street and watched the object continue to fly above the tree tops. It seemed to go up and down to stay right above the tree tops as it flew away. I watched the object through my binoculars for about 10 minutes until it became a speck in the binoculars.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then 4 golden disks appeared around the speck and in a moment the disks and object disappeared. The sighting lasted about 15 minutes,(4 to 5 minutes without binoculars and about 10 minutes with binoculars.)  I sketched or drew a diagram of the object on Monday, 18 June 1990. This was the day after I sighted the flying object. Now 15 years later (27 June 2005), I have Xeroxed my sketch at a magnification of 4x and then scanned this very same hand-drawn figure electronically into a computer &#34;JPEG&#34; file. I have submitted my sketch on a diskette by U.S. Mail and also by Email.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am very familiar with USAF aircraft. Kettering is located about 9 miles from Wright-Patterson AFB. So I have seen all kinds of military aircraft and civilian aircraft fly over Kettering Ohio over the past 32 years. The object I saw was not an AF aircraft. The object was not an unmanned AF reconnaissance aircraft. The object had no wings or air foils. The object was not a civilian aircraft. Over the years several ultra-lights have flown over our home and neighborhood. The flying object I saw was not an ultra-light aircraft.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Warm summer night, clear skies no wind at all. I was bringing out the garbage out to the ally no one was around, dead quite. I lived on a corner lot at the time so I could see two blocks in either direction.  iwas looking up and around at the stars when standing east I caught something in the corner of my eye. About a block to my right five or ten feet over the tree tops which were around tweny five to thirty feet up was this thing.It floated in a absulute straight line past me vary slow 2-3 miles per hour, I was about five feet from the ally. It was lightly ulluminated in a yellowish color, with a black corner to corner stripe about 1.5-2 feet wide. The thing was about the size of a vw bug. There were no edges, seems or anything protruding from it.Ten or so feet long six or so feet wide. The closest thing I can come up with is the movie of Star Trek were they put spock into a cascate and sent him to some planet. Its shape was quit quite simular. I heard no sound from it, no trafic anyware at all, this was on a Sunday night.I watched it go past me straight down the ally and out of site. Istood the wondering what the hell was that, nothing can do that. I looked around to see if maybe someone else was around but nobody was there. I don&#39;t know what it was, I do remember I had An erie sense about it. Has anyone else seen this? I know it&#39;s weird but the more i&#39;ve thought of this thing for the past seven years, I have a strange feeling it was some sort of probe, crazy huh. Well thats about it thanks for listening.<n>

Approximately 10 miles South West of Watford we saw a silver ball approaching us at high speed.It went straight past us, and stopped dead, with no deceleration. We turned to follow it, and it seemed as though it was playing games with us,rising vertically at high speed, and constantly changing course.I know of no technology that could duplicate the way this machine moved.We never discussed the incident afterwards,as we did not wish to make fools of ourselves,particularly as we would both be looking for employment as professional pilots soon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

6/15/90 02:00|Peru|IN|Circle|5 minutes|CIRCLE OF APPROXIMATELY TEN LIGHTS SIGHTED HOVERING OVER  PERU, INDIANA.|2/22/02|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/021/S21852.html|20|ndxe199006| CIRCLE OF APPROXIMATELY TEN LIGHTS SIGHTED HOVERING OVER  PERU, INDIANA.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In the early morning hours of mid summer in 1991 I witnessed a &#34;Circle&#34; UFO.  I had gotten off of work at a local restaurant.  I walked home a block and a half away to change from my work clothes and into my running clothes.  I proceeded to run to a local Villiage Pantry for a late night snack.  I was running on West Main St on the north side of the road.  I at the time was having a conversation with &#34;God.&#34;  I had asked him and her if they could show me an &#34;Angel of the Lord&#34; or what I refer to as whats described in the Christian Bible.  Almost insantaniously behind my destination spot on the North East corner of Main and Hospital Rd I noticed what appeared to be an airplane.  I was a little confused as to why this plane or object was flying so low and right over a main street in town.  I stopped running and proceeded to walk the rest of the way.  All the while watching the object come closer.  It at first appeared to be a taller vehicle in the road behind a regular size car which was stopped at a red light at the intersection of West Main and Hosptial Rd.  I thought maybe it was a &#34;Monster Truck.&#34;  Living in the midwest that wouldn&#39;t have surprised me.  But then it was noticeably higher in the horizon.  And the lights in front did look very much like bright yellow headlights of a truck.  It then appeared like lights from maybe a medium sized aircraft.  I stood on the north east corner of Main and Freemont St to observe the object come closer.  I had seen a car in front of the object in question turn left off of West Main St then proceed North onto Hospital Rd.  I often wondered if the occupants in that vehicle had seen what I had seen.  Just south of me on the South East corner of Main and Freemont is a church.  And on the South West corner of the intersection there is a wood and brick home.  A home also stood on the North West corner.  On the corner that I was standing there stands a mansion.  I checked the wind around me and listened for any noise.  There was neither wind or noise.  Only the so! und of m y breathe and the sound of my shoes when I occasionally moved a foot or two.  There also was no moon visible and it was a starry night.  The object proceeded to move east over West Main St.  When the object became closer to me the &#34;headlights&#34; disappeared behind the trees and when the object was totally within view it hovered over the trees and the home on the South West corner of West Main and Freemont St.  I was in &#34;awe&#34; of what I was seeing.  We were caddy corner from each other.  I couldn&#39;t make out a body to what I was seeing only approximately ten soft circular white lights in a perfect circle.  The distance of the object or lights seemed to be within 50 feet from the ground or 30 from the top of the home it was hovering over.  It was very surreal to say the least.  I wasn&#39;t scared.  I was enthrawled if anything.  I wanted to know and experience more of what I was seeing.  I started thanking &#34;God&#34; for giving me a response to what I was only moments ago talking with him and her about.  Then I thought to myself, &#34;Why me?&#34;  Some twenty-something year old from Peru, Indiana.  I was no one important at least in the eyes of anyone on Earth besides maybe my mother.  I decided to go in for a closer look by jaywalking across the street where I would be right under it or them.  In the same instance that I proceeded to walk over to the South West corner of the intersection the lights and maybe object started to move in a &#34;counter clock wise&#34; motion heading South East.  I stopped in the middle of the intersection saying in a whisper, &#34;Don&#39;t go.&#34;  And, &#34;I want to see more.&#34;  I was not afraid.  I watched as it or they dissappeared behind the houses and trees in town.  I ran to the river which is three blocks south of where I stood.  Which took approximately a minute.  I stood on the railroad tracks that are located on the north side of the Wabash River.  In the South Eastern part of town maybe a half a mile away all I saw was the same &#34;beams&#34; of light that I had initially seen shining toward the south.  I still ! could se e no shape to what was giving off the strange lights.  I at that moment assumed it was a plane and came to the conclusion that the object or lights that I saw had vanished.  Only now do I know that the beams of lights where of the same.  The following day I phoned Grissom Air Force Base which is located South West of town to see if there had been any night flights the night I witnessed my UFO.  I was told that there were no night flights in the area.  Which didn&#39;t surprise me because the base was due to close in a matter of a few years.  It was only until today that I decided to find out if others have witnessed similar occurrances and experiences by logging onto NUFRC.  You would think that I would have written the exact month and date of this.  But after being laughed at over and over again after telling my eye witness account the month and date didn&#39;t seem so important.  Until now.  Many people have labeled me &#34;crazy&#34; because of what I tell them.  &#34;I could care less.&#34;  Now I have validation of what I had seen.  Whether it was &#34;God&#34; giving me an answer to what I was asking or something or someone else...<n>

As I watched the object it appeared to change colour going from blue through to green through to yellow.  The object appeared to be around fifteen hundred to two thousand feet.   It appeared to be moving slightly from left to right and then returning in the opposite direction.  I telephoned Air Traffic Control at Glasgow Airport which is only around two miles from our house.   I was advised they had no aircraft in the immediate vicinity.  I observed the object for around fifteen minutes.   It was a clear night and visibility was good.    The object suddenly departed very quickly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

I did have a picture of it once but the picture burnt in my house in 1997 but at the way the picture was taken there wasn&#39;t much one could tell by it.

I saw a bright light.  I thought, after a few minutes, it was a plane because it slowly got closer and brighter.  Then my dogs tried to lay flat on the ground and I found myself trying to hide under trees and bushes.  I don&#39;t know why.  This thing I thought was a plane was now gliding right over the top of us.  It was clear, like water, and silent.  Like a big blob, undescribable.  No lights, but you could tell there was a perimeter to this thing, but it was like looking at water.  It was moving very slowly and skimmed over the top of the trees and went on its way.  I don&#39;t know how long the whole incident lasted, but I can tell you that from the minute I first saw that light I was almost in a trance.  I couldn&#39;t take my eyes off of it.  I ran home after it had passed, called the radio and tv stations and police but nobody else reported seeing anything.  I was probably about 21 at the time.<n>

I can not even attest to the year with certainty.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was a late evening sighting, around 10-11pm.  My neighbor and I witnessed at least a dozen lights, of different colors. They moved slowly through the night sky as if part of a single large craft.  At first only the lights were apparent, not the craft itself.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The lights were mostly blue but there were also red, yellow, green and a few white lights.  All of the lights were of approximately the same brightness and remained solid the entire time they were on (no blinking or similar).  They also seemed to be arranged haphazardly around the craft (no pattern).<n> <n><n> <n><n> We observed the object for 2 to 3 minutes as it moved slowly across our field of vision in an approximately West to East direction.  It was then, that a bright white flash emanated from behind the craft.  We could clearly make out the silhouette of a smooth saucer shape.  After the flash, most of the colored lights began to go out one by one very quickly.  After about 10 to 12 seconds, all but 5 or 6 of the colored lights were out.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was at this time that I became aware of the sound from the craft.  It was very quite but not silent.  I am not sure if it didn’t make noise before the first flash or if I just didn’t notice it. My neighbor said later that he was unsure as well.  The sound it made was a kind of hum;  Similar to the kind of hum that some older electronics make.  I have since heard electric transformers (like the ones on telephone poles) make a similar noise.<n> <n><n> <n><n> For the next 5 to 7 minutes, we watched as the craft apparently changed its direction very leisurely to the North West.  This was almost exactly away from where we were standing.  We observed two more flashes like the one I described.  Each time there was a momentary pause (for about a second) in the hum.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We lost sight of the object as it moved away from us and descended behind a line of trees.  I estimate its length was around 25 feet long. Its height was approximately that of a two story house.  I feel confident in this estimate since I am familiar with the line of trees that it went behind.  They separate two fields that were used to graze cattle.  My friends and I sometimes used the field as a shortcut. I used the trees as a reference as it descended behind them.  Although it was night, the tree line is visible against the starry night.  Due to the hilliness of the ground, there was no way to see the bottom halves of the trees or the craft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Unfortunately, I am unsure of the exact date.  I was around 12 at the time, which would have been approximately 1990.  I think it was in the mid to late summer since we were outside without jackets and perfectly comfortable.  The moon was near full and the stars were plainly visible in the sky.  There were a few fluffy white clouds but the object was never near them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I believe the bulk of the sighting took place within a quarter of a mile away but I can’t say for sure.  The tree line that the object descended behind is at most a quarter mile away   I can’t say whether the object landed or not but it certainly flew below treetop level.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date is approximate.

We went outside and stood facing the south in our driveway.  At the end of our driveway, there was something that had to be huge, because it blocked out the stars in the sky.  It was just above the treeline and we could not make out a shape because of treetops coming together over part of it and also because of an outside light behind us that made it hard to get our eyes accustomed to the dark.  It had three large white lights (like spotlights) that strobed in a regular series one after the other and repeated this over and over for the twenty minutes we stood and watched.  There were several red and green lights which did not blink in a row. There was absolutely no sound, but there was a faint feel of an electrical charge in the air.  No smell.  We stood and watched and it never moved at all, until my husband started to get the car so we could follow it when it left.  As he reached the car, it took off suddenly to the East at a tremendous rate of speed and disappeared. My husband is a patternmaker by trade and has some college.  I have some college and am a housewife and writer.  We live in the country and have raised our children here.<n>

The headline in the August 27, 1998 &#34;RanchLand News&#34; (published in Simla, CO) described recent UFO sightings.  The article described a UFO sighting exactly like I personally had while driving south from Colorado Springs on highway 115 in the late 80&#39;s to 1990. Every time I stopped at a convenience store on Hwy 24 East of Colorado Springs over the days I was there, I mentioned the UFO headlines of their local paper.  To my surprise many locals shared of their sightings near this multiple Air Base region.  One man of &#39;credible&#39; nature who is a pilot said him and his wife were driving east on Hwy 24 to Colorado Springs when they saw a large ball of fire heading towards Cheyenne Mountain (NORAD).  He added that it veer to the right along the mountain and disappear over the side then went towards &#34;Pikes Peak&#34;.  Both him and his wife saw this at about 5 a.m. earlier this summer.  I then told him of my 1990ish sighting and he commented that the UFO I saw stationary in the sky must have had a &#34;fuel problem&#34;. Until this recent trip to Colorado Springs I never really talked about the sighting much to anyone.   In re-driving the hwy 115 I found at about the county line what I believe is the location where I had the sighting.  There is evidence of brush having previously been burnt there—perhaps set by the flaming UFO? This is what I remember of my earlier sighting back in the late 80&#39;s to 1990: It was late at night--probably 11:00 p.m. or later.  I was driving south of Colorado Springs on highway 115.  Fort Carson is on the East Side of the road.  About 4/10ths to a half-mile to my front-left just over a notch in a ridge was a large object suspended in the sky. It was brightly flaming on the bottom and dripping profusely toward the ground over the ridge.  At first I thought it was a &#34;dirigible&#34; (large blimp) on fire, but it was only burning on the lower half.  Being that it was over Fort Carson, I thought that it might be some kind of military base experiment.  I pulled over to the side of the road for a few minutes, but then just shrugged it off and drove on.  I never drove the road again until this fall of 1998.<n>

It was triangle shaped with lights all around, white, red and green lights, it was not a helicopter nor was it an airplane. It went straight over the top of me standing in my front yard, thee was zero sound. It moved slowly until it disappeared over the hills.

So we watched it and after about 5 minutes the objected appeared to raise several feet straight up and stopped. Then afer about another 5-10 minutes it raised higher but veried to the right and stopped. Then about 5 or so minutes later it litterly shoot across the valley directly over top of us and was gone.

I was visiting home from the Univ. of OK for the summer.  My mom had told me stories earlier in the day about how she and a neighbor up the hill had seen a UFO a few times together.  I thought she was &#34;full of it&#34;, so she said let&#39;s try to see it tonight.  We live in a vally in rural OK.  Not much light, so the sky is highly visible. We looked into the western sky with our naked eyes (where they had previously viewed it).  Only woods and creeks that way.  To my amazement we saw it, shortly after looking for it.  It looked like a bright star at first. But it proceeded to move first slowly, then sharply back and forth and up and down(no particular order).  It changed several colors, but it was so long ago that I can&#39;t remember the actual ones.  It was completely quiet.  We should have heard something if it were a conventional craft, because it was pretty close to us.  We didn&#39;t report it to authorities, but did tell friends and family.  She(mom) never saw it again after that night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

I am now 20, but I remember the event like it was yesterday. A few friends and I were outside in the cul-de-sac we lived in when I looked up to the NE and saw a commerical airliner flying above the hill NE of town. The plane appeared to just be a normal airliner (Boeing 747, etc.) I also noticed something behind the plane, it almost looked like the plane was towing something. There was a thin black line from the rear of the plane to a dark saucer type craft behind it. The object was only about 100-200 feet behind the plane. The plane and the craft continued for about 10 seconds, then the black line disappered, and the craft suddenly accelerated going underneath the plane, shooting right up in front of it, then drifted down over the other side of the hill out of view. Ever since that day, I have always believed in UFO&#39;s and life outside our own!!!!!<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date of event is approximate.  PD))<n>

This could have been a Saturday afternoon, spring break or summer vacation.  The year was anywhere from 1989 to 1993.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I believe my friend&#39;s dad noticed the UFO first, to the north.  We were on the south end of the pier looking north to our left.  It was gray/ dull-metallic in color and looked like a flying cruise ship with no protrusions of any kind.  It was flat and thick as if many levels to it, but was rectangular.  It appeared to have ports on its side or perhaps markings.  The craft was so high up that finer details  of its side were blurry and I had 20/20 vision all through school-age.  It had no lights visible and made no noise which I remember finding strange, so I remembered the whole incident fairly well.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I think the craft was in excess of 200yards long and thousands of feet high in altitude. If i hold my thumb up out in front of me, the craft appeared about 1-1.5inches wide by about 2/8 to 3/8inches thick and atleast 45 degrees above horizon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It moved very slowly for approximately 15 minutes, traveling north to south from our vantage point. It seemed to be high above North Island and Coronado.   In relation to all the other planes and blimps that were nearby at lower altitudes made the size of this &#34;craft&#34; very large and very high.  At the time many of these facts were pointed out by my friends dad, whom seemed to be astonished and in disbelief.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I knew both my neighbor and his father to be intelligent people and I have a background in science and medicine.  We discussed how incredibly awkward the craft was for about an hour with other fisherman after we lost sight of it.  It was fairly unspectacular because of its super slow speed and dull color.  It didn&#39;t seem to spin or turn or deviate from its southern route.  Someone speculated it could have held as many people as Star Trek&#39;s Enterprise-D if it were real.  We passed it off as a military craft because it was so visible to everyone, it didn&#39;t move erratically, it was in close proximity to the naval base, and it disappeared just as silently as it appeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> To my knowledge no one has reported on this &amp;quot;mother ship&amp;quot; sighting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

The object was flying over building at 5th and Hamilton st. in our town and it almost appered to be stopped. It made no noise. The object was so large I doubt if it would have fit into a football field.  I went inside my office to get another worker and when we got outside the object was gone.  I never seen anything in our newspaper and I never reported it before.  I&#39;ve always been curious as to what I seen and what it was.

There was no security system on this old car.  The honking had stopped but I grabbed my keys to see why it was doing that.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I approached the drivers side, I looked and saw a translucent sphere about the size of a basketball floating towards me from up the street.  It maintained a height if about 4&#39; off the ground. I opened the car door, got in, and shut the door.  The sphere floated right by the window maybe 2&#39; away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I watched it follow the road around the corner through my side and rear view mirror.  I did not bother to follow it as I was quite perplexed.  It was translucent enough that it seemed to want to appear invisible.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I never really acted like I had seen it, and it seemed to act like I couldn&#39;t see it, as it never changed trajectory or speed.  I had just moved into this suburban neighborhood after spending a couple of years in a very remote location near Lake Shasta, where many other strange occurrences had occurred. Prior to this, I had never seen a &#39;UFO&#39;, nor have I since.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have, however, seen and experienced many strange things not in the sky, but close to the ground.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had never researched this until today, reading other similar accounts sends chills and makes me quite emotional. Very strange indeed.<n>

I remember becoming very scared and not knowing what was going on.  I then saw what appeared to be a plane, had all the proper flashing lights on it, and I could hear the roar of the engines, heading toward this other ball of light.  As the two got closer, the light became brighter.  Eventually the two seemingly ran into each other, there was a bright flash, all white.  And the dot of light just kept on moving across the sky.

6/1/90 00:30|Townsville (Australia)||Teardrop|15min|Craft invades no fly military airspace undetected by radar|5/15/06|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/049/S49766.html|53|ndxe199006| Craft invades no fly military airspace undetected by radar<n> <n><n> <n><n> I feel compelled to tell what I saw based on info I just got from your sight about the guy in the army who along with another soldier saw a very similar shaped UFO to the one my wife and I saw. In 92 my wife and I had recently bought a new house in a rural area of our home town. It was a very hot sumer and our newly planted outdoor plants were suffering badly with the days heat. We were both working by day and watering plants at night on our return home which on this occassion was very late. The area we lived in was a no fly zone as it was military controlled airspace and our local airforce base was responsable for that zone. I should also mention that I have and have held a pilots licence for 27 years. I have flown in both fixed and rotory winged aircraft many times, both in the civil and military situations. Roughly between 12 and 12:30 I was watering the plants and my wife was taking a shower. I was enjoying the cool night air and marvelling at the clear night sky when suddenly a strange craft lifted above the nearby tree line. It appeared to glow a kind of yellowish colour over all but along the sides there were what I can only describe as roundish areas that glowed orange, 3 or 4 of them. This craft was teardrop shape but in a horizontal aspect, slightly higher though at the wider end. It lift off in a corkscrew effect and made no sound. I have no doubt that it was not a helo. I know their flight paterns and the way they operate very well, this was not a helo. At this point a started kicking the way and yelling to my wife to come look at this thing, not wanting to take my eyes off it for a moment. I then realised that I was not the only one who had seen this as a very dark coloured car raced past our house in the direction of the craft. I was releaved to know that I was not the only one who was seeing this. My wife came out and asked what the problem was. I told her the stroy and then after what seemed like an eternity of searching the sky I resigned myself to the fact that I was the only person who saw it and was frustrated by that thought. It was my trun for the shower and her turn with the garden hose. I was no sooner in the shower when in she came and said with a trembling voice....you better get out here, that thing is right over the house and there is some sort of stuff coming out of it. Grabing a towel I bolted for the verander. Again I searched the sky to no avail. I asked her what she meant by stuff coming out of it. She said &#34;It fit the discription you gave me but from underneath I could see sparkly stuff that trailed back from the sides. It was then I became aware of the dark colourd car moving very slowly along the street and come to a spot out front. I thought this was a good sign that we were not alone in this so I started toward the car. At roughly 30 yards on a moonlit night and raped in a white towel I don&#39;t think I looked inposing but the car suddenly dashed off again. I went back inside and straight to the phone. I called RAAF base Townsville and the following conversation took place....<n> <n><n> <n><n> Yes hello, can you tell me what aircraft you have flying in the area of *********** currently please?  Response &#34;What, at this hour, nothing, you would have to be kidding&#34;.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Well I&#39;m not kidding, there is something flying around here right now.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Response &#34;Can&#39;t be, thats military zoning, we would know about it if there was.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Yes I know it&#39;s military, thats why I&#39;m calling you. Listen there is something out here and I&#39;ve gotta tell yuh, I am a pilot with both fixed and rotory wing experience and this is nothing like that. What have you got on radar?<n> <n><n> <n><n> Response &#34;Nothing, look, are you sure about this?<n> <n><n> <n><n> Deadly, I&#39;m not alone, I have my wife as a witness!<n> <n><n> <n><n> Response &#34;Ok, well look there is nothing I can tell you except that the sky is very clear, NO TRAFFIC ON RADAR. Thanks for calling it in though!<n> <n><n> <n><n> My wife and I told our friends who were envious mostly. The funny thing about it is that some months or so later there was a UFO filmed by an amateur at a soccer game in broard daylight in another state.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My wife and I looked at each other and I don&#39;t mind telling you, when my wife said pointing at the TV &#34;thats it, thats it and the damb thing is corkscrewing,....the hair stood up on the back of my neck!!!<n>
