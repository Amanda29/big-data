Thinking hard about it but still not sure, it would have been around 1952-1955 time period.  It was mid afternoon.  I lived in Manville, Rhode Island.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had been acting up, and my mother sent me upstairs to my room as punishment. I wanted to be outside playing with my friends, but here I was stuck in my room looking out the window, feeling sorry for myself.  I was there for some time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Outside my window stood a large elm tree, and its first branches were above the roof of the 2 story house. Some of the leaves on the branches partly obscured some of my view. About the 9 to 12 o&#39;clock position. The rest of the sky was cloudless and blue from the 12 o&#39;clock position to about 3 o&#39;clock. From 3 o&#39;clock there were houses on the near hill side, and finally down to the 4 o&#39;clock position was the roof of the next door neighbors home that was about 50 feet away. I was looking south.<n> <n><n> <n><n> From behind one of the houses on the hill, appeared first one colored light, then several more. They were moving in a group of about a dozen lights, evenly spaced. Each light, was a different color. Each light being about the size of a pencil eraser end at arms length. The group was about the size of a soccer ball held at arms length. The lights didn&#39;t blink, the colors they were, remained steady. Orange, green, red, and one or two almost white. They were moving from the south to the north.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I watched in silent amazement. The group moved across the blue sky, then behind some of the elm leaves and again they appeared in a patch of blue sky and then disappeared behind more leaves and were gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> During the 50&#39;s planes made noise.........a lot of noise.  We were directly under the flight path of four engine planes flying to Boston&#39;s Logan airport 60 miles to the northeast.  You not only heard the planes go by, but you felt them.  The noise would vibrate though you.  There was no traffic in the nearby street at the time I was watching the lights only a few birds chirping here and there.  It was this thought that filled me with fear.  What I had just witnessed passed by without a single sound, nothing!   As the fear built up in me, crying I ran down the stairs to tell my mother.  I think she thought I was putting on a performance, to be let out.  She comforted me, and sent me outside.  I didn&#39;t want to go, but she insisted.  I then sat on the porch, looking up at the sky thinking about what I had just seen.<n>

There were reddish in color and had a short trail behind each. Based on Airforce cargo planes and the distance away from us they seemed larger.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I just encountered your site recently. This siting was over 50 years ago and I had one other UFO siting of a disk shape ship flying over Tacoma in 1957 which is posted elsewhere. Since that time I have not seen a UFO.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The date is an estimate. I was in junior high and it was a summer softball program.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My friend and I stayed after practice to hit balls. After hitting the ball and looking up while watching it I noticed the spheres and told my friend to do the same.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We first thought that it was a military exercise but when we arrived home and listened to a local radio station there were a lot of people calling in about this siting so we also did and they told us that there were more than 100 people that called in.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  One of two good reports from the same witness.

Another summer night a round disk houvered over the intersection of Barns and williamsbridge Road. About 70 people observed it.  Suddenly it moved slighty and was gone in a flash.  The last one may seem strange but true.  I was walking at night on a quite street (I was about 9 years old) I had a strange feeling and looked up into the sky, I saw a star moving as if following me.  I walked about 1 1/2 blocks and stopped. I did an about face and started walking in the opposite direction.  The star did a sort of u turn and started moving with me.  Initally I was frighteded but later felt that it was some kind of good sigh.  I would be willing to be interrogated buy any skeptic even under truth serom.

7/15/52 18:30|North Bend|WA|Other|2-3 minutes|old sighting (1952 0r '53) of daylight object seen from approximately 50 '.|2/22/05|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/041/S41867.html|6|ndxe195207| old sighting (1952 0r &#39;53) of daylight object seen from approximately 50 &#39;.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was 7 or 8 years old.I was with my cousin (same age) on the porch of his home near the Snoqualmie River.  We were taking, looking out over the field, when I saw this thing coming toward us.  It was floating/bobbing along, at just about the height of the apple tree in the field, possibly 25&#39; off the ground.  It was pinkish-colred and it glowed.  It was clear, not fuzzy at all, perfectly symetrical except for a small triangular &#39;tail&#39; on the back side of it.  It came toward where we were, and I just knew, somehow, that it was going to stop when it got to us.  It did stop.  We were on the porch.  Across the driveway, just out in the field, just above the apple tree, it stopped and held perfectly still.  There was no sound at all.  I looked for features on it and there were none that I could see.  There were no doors, no windows, no sign of how someone would enter such a craft.  We both just stared at it for awhile, talking to one another about what it might be.  Then I yelled for my parents to come out and see it.  My parents and my aunt and uncle were in the living room, talking, and they had locked the front door to keep us-all from running through the house.  (We could get in through the back door but we used to like to run through the house from the back to the front and run out the front door and my aunt didn&#39;t like us to do this.) So, keeping my eyes on it, I backed up to the front door and yelled and knocked on it, but they still didn&#39;t pay attention.  Finally, in desperation, I turned around and pounded on the door with both fists and yelled my head off.  This got some results and they all appeared on the front porch, but by then the object had left.  My cousin said that when I began to really yell, it &#34;took off like a shot, like a streak of light, and disappeared&#34;.  My parents took us inside, took us into separate rooms and had us draw pictures of what we had seen.  Our pictures and descriptions were similar. I remember being frustrated with my drawing because I couldn&#39;t make it look like what I had seen.  I still can&#39;t.  The geometry of the object was so perfect that I don&#39;t have the talent to draw it, even though it is essentially a sphere with a triangle in back of it.  It appeared to be machined; there was nothing at all plasma-like or unclear about it.  There had been a rash of sightings of UFO objects around the Snoqualmie Valley around this time.  A friend of my father&#39;s, a timber faller who was on a ridge with his crew, had seen a formation of 5 silver discs pass below them.  They watched them move up the valley and out of sight.  They were astounded, to say the least.  So, UFO&#39;s were on people&#39;s minds at that time and place.  This is the reason I am writing.  I just heard Peter Davenport mention on the Jeff Rense Show, that he has often heard of people talking about UFOs before sighting them.  I have a distinct memory of walking up from the river with all of my cousins (3 boys) and talking with them about UFO&#39;s and wondering what seeing one would be like, about 5 minutes before this event.  Although we have talked about this event over the years, my memory of it and my cousin&#39;s memory are no longer the same.  The cousin I saw it with now claims that what we saw was a &#34;silvery disc-like thing&#34; that was &#34;spinning around&#34;.  Also, my older cousin, who was not with us at the time, now backs him up and also says he was there on the porch with us!  I have a particularly good long-term memory and am pretty sure I am right about ths.  Another thing I remember is my father coming into the house the next day (or so) and saying that there had been a &#34;streak of light&#34; or UFO,  spotted over Seattle at approximately the time that our object would have gotten there.It had taken off going in the direction of Seattle, which is very close to Snoqualmie and North Bend, approximately 25-30 miles. I should add that my parents and my aunt and uncle absolutely believed our story.   My sighting time and the date are my best attempt to pinpoint time and date.  It was a summer evening, it was warm and had been a sunny day, it was before we moved away from that area.  I am not positive whether it was 1952 or 1953, therefore I am not positive about my age.  The object would have been approximately 50 feet away from us, 25&#39; in the air and smallish, maybe 6&#39;in diameter.  If I had held out my hand at arm&#39;s length, it would  have just about covered it; but it was awfully close to us. Don&#39;t know if you have any interest in this, as it is unlike any other story I&#39;ve ever heard.  Seeing it changed my life because i don&#39;t &#34;think&#34; there are UFOs, I know there are.  And I know, too, that this object wasn&#39;t from a terrestrial source...it was very strange and otherworldly.  I grew up to be a mental health professional, a licensed clinical social worker, so I also know that I&#39;m not crazy.  Thanks for listening.

Several were outside our work building, taking a break.  I do not remember the exact time nor the exact date.  I only know that it was in the early 1950s, and after seeing Peter Jennings program recently, I realize that it was probably 1952.  Three saucers appeared in the sky in the distance, northwest of where we were.  They hovered there momentarily, then moved very suddenly, very quickly, toward us.  The movement was much faster than any airplane or other known object could move.  They stopped, in the near distance, and hovered briefly, then just disappeared.  They were shaped like discs with a rounded dome in the center, and they were white.  We could not believe what we saw.  We all decided they must be something the military was exerimenting with.  Vandenburg Air Base is to the northwest of Wilmington, and we thought they must have come from there, but we also felt they could be genuine UFOs.  The incident has never been explained.  It just happened, and I saw it clearly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of sighting is approximate.  PD))<n>

My parents are no longer alive to verify what I report here.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was a hot July night in 1952, and my parents and I were sitting in our backyard trying to cool off.  My mother and I were lying on a blanket, looking at the stars.  My mother was pointing out various constellations to me when I noticed a small green, disc-shaped object circling in a tight oval path.  It seemed to me very small and far away.  I asked my parents what it was.  They had no idea, but they became quite interested in it.  My mother eventually went into the house and phoned someone to report what we were seeing.  I don&#39;t kinow who she phoned--police, media, or whatever.  The following morning, our newspapers (Washington Post, Washington Daily News, etc.) were full of front page reports of UFOs over DC.  The photos that appeared in our newspapers in no way resembled what my parents and I had observed.  With 50-some years of hindsight, I now wonder if I witnessed a &#34;mother ship&#34; to the objects that were photographed over DC that night.  I know this report is way out in left field from what was originally reported about this event, but I think maybe my parents and I saw something in addition to what was reported in the media at that time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We are grateful to the witness for this report.  Two dramatic events occurred over Washington, D.C., on July 17 and July 24, 1952, which were detected on radar.  The witness may have observed one of the objects on either of those two dates.

When I got back, he said that when I began to run up the street, the disk moved horizontally and disappeared in a couple of seconds. This friend became a newspaper sportwriter for his avocation and I became machinist and a doctor later in life. I saw him last year and he told the same story to my wife.

A friend of mine and I decided to continue practice softball after everyone had left. I hit a high ball and as I watch it I noticed six spheres flying in formation. Told my friend to look up and he and I watched them for about 2 minutes. It was a arc&#39;d flight in the vacinity of Fort Lewis. They were in formation as one then two and again one then two. Based on the size and distance away and because McCord Airforce Base was close by, I now estimate the size to be that of a Boeing 747. When we ran home we turned on the radio to a talk show and they said that over 100 people had called in asking if the Air Force was testing a new type of flying vehicle.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In 1957 when I had returned home from a date, I glaced to the northern sky overlooking Tacoma and noticed a disk shaped object the size of a Boeing 727 flying over Tacoma in and out of clouds. This lasted about 30 seconds due to the cloud cover. No noize and the object was metallic with what looked like windows around the perimeter of the DISK.<n> <n><n> <n><n> IN 1965 I student taught in Bellingham, Washington. In a science class I mentioned the fact that I did see a UFO once. An indian boy of age 14 came to me later because he did not want to be ridiculed and told me of an incident when he viewed a UFO hover overhead and then take off directly upwards at high speeds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In 1968 I was a system engineer at Boeing after finding out how little teachers get payed since I also had a degree in Physics. I was in a car pool. I mentioned once that I had seen a UFO and one of the other fellows remarked that he had seen a cigar shape UFO once.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In 1969 I was a manager of system development at Boeing and one of my employees told me during lunch that when he was traveling to California from Washington, six USO flew overhead and caused some interference such that the cars on the freeway stalled out.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In 1980 as manager of On Line Systems for an insurance company in Galveston, Tx.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I again mentioned the fact that I did experence seeing a UFO and one of the staff members said that he say a small sphere flying around his neighborhood in a northern state (don&#39;t remember which one.)  In 1981 again at lunch I mentioned something about UFO&#39;s and computer operator overheard what I had said and talked to me in primvate saying that he say a disk shape UFO ffying over the causeway one day when he was coming to work.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In 2004 while downloading a large file, I stumbled onto your web site and noticed that we are the only ones that have seen it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I sometime wonder if the Star of Bethlaham seen by the wisemen when Jesus was born was not a UFO sent to this planet in recognition of a highly significant event, Since the Star could not really be a star as described.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We have requested that the witness re-submit each of the reports individually.

After turning the soil, a harrow was hitched behind the horses and dad went round and round, back and forth, over and over the field until the soil was loosened sufficiently for planting.  Each seed was placed carefully in mounds of soil by hand until the entire field was sowed.  I’m sure silent prayers were also uttered to the heavenly Father that he would bless this endeavor.  Anxiously we awaited the first sign of sprouts to poke their green heads from their graves.  The weather was perfect.  Gentle rain from heaven sprinkled at the opportune time.  Delightedly, one morning as ! we gazed out over the terrain, we saw a miracle had taken place overnight. God had awoken those seeds and the field was covered with pale green sprouts everywhere.  Each day we could see the progress of their growth as they grew larger and larger.  Along with the planted cucumber seeds there also grew tares in the field.  Dutifully, we shouldered our garden hoes each day to attack the formidable foe.  Countless hours were spent on our knees carefully pulling weeds from around the delicate and precious vegetation.  The promise of wages when the cucumbers were sold kept us at task.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After weeks of heavy toil, the plants began to blossom and beautiful yellow flowers blanketed the landscape.  Shortly thereafter the blooms began to wither and tiny stubs appeared where the flowers had been. Every morning we hurried to the patch to see how quickly they grew. The day finally arrived when dad said, “start picking.”  How exciting it was. Now we were going to benefit from the fruits of our la! bors and bring them to market. Visions of $$$$$ danced in my head. I w as going to be rich!!!! It was a tedious task.  They needed to be picked every day.  They could only be a certain size, not bigger or smaller.  Every day they needed to be brought to the pickle factory in town.  I began to be weary of this job, but I continued to labor knowing I would soon have some money of my own.<n> <n><n> <n><n> One day tiring of pick, pick, picking pickles, I laid down on my back between the rows, put my hands behind my head and rested for awhile.  As I gazed up at the cloudless, clear blue sky, my eyes were attracted to something directly above.  The sun was glinting off an object that was silver in color. It looked like a donut in the sky because I could see the blue sky through the hole in the middle. I lay there and watched for a very long time and it kind of frightened me because I had not seen anything like it before. Prior to this, in my life, I had not ever seen anything in the skies other than clouds and birds. It would be years later when I saw an airplane for the first time. I am unable to place a size or put a distance to this object but I recall that it stayed stationary for perhaps a half hour and then suddenly it was gone. What was it? UFO? Dad returned from town one day and proudly offered his closed fist to me. Holding my hand, he placed a $10.00 bill into it. Wow!!! $10.00!!! All my own!!! All my hard labor over the summer was worth it. Now I could buy whatever I wanted and there was more to come. The harvest was about half over when dad returned from selling the days harvest. With a long face he told us the pickle factory would no longer purchase any cucumbers from us because they had discovered some type of blight in them. Visions of becoming wealthy quickly dissipated. Oh, well, I still had my $10.00. Before I had a chance to go to town, my mother pleadingly asked me if she could borrow the money to buy some food. Reluctantly, I relinquished my treasure and I never saw it again. Times were very difficult in those days and even if I grudgingly gave up my hard earned cash, I knew she wouldn’t have asked for it if she didn’t really need it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Note: After I wrote this story about 60 years later, my older brother and one of my older sisters told me they also remember the object, just the same as I described it.<n>
