She was born in April 1986 and this sighting happened in the fall of 1986. I believe it was near the end of October or the beginning November. On this night, my husband and I had put our three daughters to bed at about 9:00pm. We stayed up late watching T.V. and talking. At around 3:00am I was sitting at the end of our bed watching an old movie on T.V. and my husband was lying in our bed watching the movie.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I was watching the movie, I realized that I could hear this sound coming from outside of my bedroom window. At first I didn&#39;t think much of it but then I thought to myself, what is that noise at 3:00 in the morning? I sat up straight on the end of my bed and listened. It was a vacuum cleaner! Who would be vacuuming at 3:00 in the morning? And Outside! I said to my husband,&#34;Someone is vacuuming this late at night, or should I say this early in the morning?&#34;  I asked him do you hear that? He said yes. I said &#34;Is someone drunk or something why would someone do that? He said, &#34;I don&#39;t know, someone being crazy.&#34; I said that I could not understand why they would be outside on the patio vacuuming. We had square cement patios off of our diningrooms in the back yard. We lived in a two story building so our bedroom was on the second floor. I was trying to make sense of hearing a vacuum cleaner running at 3:00am. I told my husband, &#34;Maybe someone knocked over a potted plant or something and they were cleaning it up&#34;  but at this time! I said I am going to look and see who it is.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I got to my bedroom window, I slowly opened it so who ever was outside would not know that I was watching them. I wasn&#39;t going to say anything to them I just wanted to see what was going on. I pushed my face against the screen and looked down below to the direction of where I thought the noise was coming from. I was expecting to see a porch light on and someone vacuuming their patio, I know this sounds crazy but its true. There was no light on. It was totally dark on all of the patios that ran along the back of the building. I thought was is that vacuuming noise? There is no one out here. I was pushing my face against the window screen looking back and forth across the back of the building. Nothing. I had been hearing the vacuuming sound for about 5 minutes by then.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After finding no one down below vacuuming their patio, I was confused and looked out over the back yard. It was a big open field with a grove of trees stretching across the back of the field. I still heard the vacuum cleaner running. I don&#39;t know why but kneeling on my knees looking out the window, I slowly looked up, what I saw took my breath away! I had to make myself breathe. My mouth was hung open, I could not speak. I could not be seeing what I was seeing! There above the grove of trees a little to my right was a space ship! I remember shaking, my mind was frozen as were my eyes on this huge, massive thing floating before me in the air! All I could think of was to call my husband over he has to witness this, so later on when I told people they would not tell me I was dreaming it all.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I could still here the vacuum cleaner sound it was coming from this huge space ship. I remember in my state of shock thinking how can this massive thing only be making such a small sound as a vacuum cleaner? I called my husband, but I dared not look away for fear that it might take off. I could not take my eyes off it, I wanted to remember everything about it. I called my husband again, he was getting annoyed because he was tired. &#34;What?&#34; he said to me as I am trying not to pass out from shock and fear. &#34;Come here, Oh my God, come here!! You are not going to believe this!!&#34; &#34;What is it?&#34; he asked me. &#34; You wouldn&#39;t believe me if I told you!&#34; I said to him. My husband gets up off of the bed and walks over to where I am and bends down and looks out of the window. He was looking down below and out straight ahead.&#34;What is it?&#34; he said to me with anger in his voice. I pointed up in the sky and said &#34;Look over there!&#34;  My husbands knees gave way and he was kneeling beside me staring at this huge space ship.&#34; Oh my God, Oh my God!&#34; that was all he could say. As we both knelt there staring up at this thing I asked my husband do we have any film in the camera, he said no. We just kept staring. We were both in shock. Oh my God is all that either one of us could say. I wanted to run and find the camera but I was afraid it would be gone when I got back and I wanted to stare at this thing for as long as I possibly could before it flew away. I noticed that the trees underneath the ship were not moving. You would think that the force of the engines would have been making the trees dance around but they were standing still. I could still hear the vacuum cleaner sound coming from this thing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I said to my husband,&#34;Lets try to remember everything about the way it looks.&#34; I told him, how could such a huge ship make just the sound of a vacuum cleaner. He said he did not know and kept staring. At that moment a chill went through me and then fear, we were staring up at this thing, what if they were staring back at us! I told my husband to get down so we both bent down on our hands and knees to where just our eyes were peeking up over the window sill. I said if I see a beam of light coming towards us I&#39;ll have a heart attack! My husband said, you and me both!  This whole sighting lasted about 3 minutes from the time my husband came to the window. I will describe to you what we saw. It was huge, it was as wide as a football field and it was perfectly round. It was shaped like, the best way to describe it was like a round football stadium, like the old one in Atlanta. It was thick on the sides, not like a saucer. I saw that it was made from some sort of   black iron or metal, I could see metal beams crossing at different points and some kind of huge bolts holding them in place. There were round shaped humps of metal going down the beams.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There were a row of lights going around the middle of the whole ship. And I think the lights did not go on until it started to leave. Because as soon as I noticed the lights, the vacuum sound got higher pitched as it lifted up slowly, then with a sound of wind it took off and within 3 seconds it was a tiny light in the sky. We were in shock, we just knelt there in silence. I don&#39;t know how much time passed before we could talk. It was amazing, shocking, frightening and thrilling. My husband doesn&#39;t want to talk about it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I could not sleep. I couldn&#39;t wait until it was late enough to call my family on the phone. Well, a couple of hours later my phone rang and it was my sister yelling on the other end of the phone that a ufo had been seen in her town that same night. She lived in Newnan, Ga. almost an hour away from me. I told that I knew, that my husband and I had seen it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD))<n>

Time: Around 12 Noon to 2:30 PM Central Weather: Fair, few clouds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was outside my home.  Something caught my perifial vision.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I also felt what is similar to “static electricity” on my skin.  It was likened to what one would feel if they rubbed an inflated balloon and ran it just above the hairs of his arm.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I saw for about two minutes a large dark purple to black Triangular shaped craft. It was not an exact triangle because the “bottom” side the triangle was just a little longer than its two other sides.  From what I could compare with objects it was near I would guess that two sides were about 75’ feet and one side was about 100’.  It was about 50’ above the ground and about several hundred feet away from me at a “11:30” position if I were standing in the middle of a clock.  It was traveling no more than 10 mph along a path that was heading about 19 to 20 degrees angle.  It made absolutely no sound.  It did not have any windows or ports. It had no markings. It had no fins. It look just like a smooth very dark purple to black triangle. I could see the bottom of the craft but only from an angle as if one is standing at a short distance off the side looking up.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About 2 minutes later, (counting time when I first saw the object it accelerated vertically as almost instantly in a 180 degree line straight up and disappeared into the blue sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About 2 minutes later I did hear the sound of jet craft and about 2 to three minutes later 3 military jets were in my plain sight but at an altitude higher than the craft I previously seen. (400’ higher maybe?.) These jets did appear to have Air Force Insignia on their tail fins but I am not sure because they were just going too fast for me to be positive about this.  I did call an Air Force base in MO.  (I don’t remember which one but I think it was Whiteman? Not sure about the spelling.) I did remember getting frustrated because no person seemed to know where exactly I should make my report to or who to talk to and no one said they had information about whether or not Air Force Jets were flying in southern Iowa at that time. So I just gave up and forgot about trying to pursue the matter.) The 3 jets did fly in the exact area the craft went vertical into the air but they kept traveling in this direction until I could no longer see them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

10/26/86 13:30|Decatur|IA|Triangle|10 seconds|It continued on straight path about 100' in air for about 8 seconds.  then went straight up for about 2 seconds and out of sight.|1/28/99|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/004/S04413.html|3|ndxe198610| It continued on straight path about 100&#39; in air for about 8 seconds.  then went straight up for about 2 seconds and out of sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was like a rounded at he edge shaped triangular shaped object. It was about 30 feet long and a little wider.  it was around 100&#39; in the air. The weather was fair as far as I can remember.  What caught my eye was that it wasn&#39;t moving fast like a plane while it was travling in a straight path but increased speed in a short time when it headed straight up. I was moving at the time getting ready to relocate in georgia.  I was a minister and my wife is now a med/surgical director at our city&#39;s hospital and also teaches nursing in college.  I have no doubt in what    i saw.  I was 30 years old at the time of the sighting and I will never forget it. I would also like to add that there were military craft flying in area several days before event and i not sure about after event.  There was no military craft flying at the time of the sighting  but military traffic was heavy days before. i<n>

Around 22:00 I noticed a quick streak that looked like a metor. It went from east to west. What caught my attention was that when it was directly overhaed it stopped.It was very small like a small star.I could see four other similar size objects in a circle like patten extending to the horizon It was similar to a clover exit ramp on the interstate. About seven minutes passed and two more lights appeared. One from the north and the other the south.They crossed the sky in less thn a second and stopped where the first light was directly overhead. The four that were doing thier circles joined sith the others. They the shot out in what looks like a super nova and dissapeared. There was no noise. I had my mother call Seymore Johnson AFB in Goldsboro to see if they had picked up anything on radar. She said the did not have any aircraft on radar. I do not know if they took a report or not.<n>
10/20/86 19:00|Raleigh/Garner|NC|Triangle|2-3 minutes|Large Triangle object in sky over North Carolina|2/1/07|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/055/S55054.html|5|ndxe198610| Large Triangle object in sky over North Carolina<n> <n><n> <n><n> This night in question takes place years ago.  I don’t even know the date, but it must have been from say early October, or until the end of march.  The reason I say this, is because my best friend and I had gone to watch NC State play basketball.  So it was definitely during basketball season.  The year was 1985, or 1986.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The only reason I’m reporting it, is because I see others who have seen similar objects.  I’ve (We’ve) kept it to ourselves all these years.  Oh, we have mentioned it to a few people, but you can imagine what kind of ribbing we took.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Anyway, it was after the ball game, and that would have been between 9 and 12 pm depending on what time the game was.  I really don’t remember if it was a 7:00 game or an 9:00 game.   We were on our way back home on 50 highway from Raleigh towards Benson.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were driving in a small pickup when we noticed a huge black object to our left.  It was really low, if I had to guess, I would say maybe 600 feet or less.  I would guess the object to be at least as long as a football field.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We pulled over and both of us opened our doors, got out, and looked up as this huge triangular object passed over us.  It was solid black, with no discernable lights except for the very tip of the triangle.  The other thing worth mentioning, is that it was slowly rotating as it moved.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Well we stood there and watched this object move from the left to directly overhead moving to the right of us.  Since we were on 50 south, that would have been East to West.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As we looked up, we were both in awe.  It made absolutely no noise whatsoever.  Completely silent.  I think that was the eeriest part of the whole thing.  How could something that huge fly the way it was flying, and make not a bit of sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We tried to follow it somewhat, but because it was so low to the ground, it was out of sight in less than 2 minutes. Gone behind the treeline.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We’ve often discussed it between ourselves, but not made too many waves.  We never heard anything else, and we figured something that big would have had to be seen and reported by other people.  I know what I saw, and I’ve watched a lot of shows about our military, and never never have seen an aircraft like what I just described.  I’m pretty sure the stealth was not out at that time, but even if it was, it did not fly in the manner with which I witnessed that night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My main reason for posting this, was to see maybe, just maybe someone else saw the same thing my friend and I did, and about that same time frame.  It would validate my experience somewhat and verify that I was not crazy!!!!<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))<n>

Myself, at the time 9 years old and my father(((deleted))at the time employed by ((company deleted))) stopped offlocal station(what brand of station I do not recall)on the way home from a scout meeting. As we were filling up, the attendant pointed out somthing unusual in the sky, at first could not see it but as I looked up in front of me facing a northern sky I saw a orangish-red colored object/craft. It stood out aainst the sky, it was shapped like a stretched nerf-football, almost ovular, but with cuved top and botton wich came to faded ends and surrounded by a arorea of light. At first the craft was in a vertical positon, and proceeded to move down very slowly at a relatively high altitude(I&#39;d dare a guess of 2-6 thousand feet up) then the craft, well,I guess the word is flipped or rotated into a horizontal postion in place, maintaing the same saucer/ovular shape. It then proceeded to very slowly move across the sky towards the north/east but in a line right across just as it had gone in a line staright down. Then suddenly it bolted of the east and was gone. The sky was relatively well lit as it was fall in that part of the country, and this whole event we witnessed for about 10 minutes. I have no idea how long the craft had been in the area or of other sightings. It made no noise, but all 3 of us concured it was like nothing we had ever seen. At first we thought it might be the exausht fire form a hot air ballon or some other plane, but when it did those manuevers, I knew of nothing and still do not that could do that. When it took off it bolted, I mean....just slightly slower than you can blink, so it went from crusing to that in nothing flat. I drew a picture when I got home, but do not have the original, both I and my  father told my mother about it upon arrival home. That is most of what I can recall of the event, although my father,myself,and the gas attendent are sure we saw some sort of craft-unlike anything I have seen. I have no idea what it was to this day. I have since moved(since 1989)back to where my parents are both originally from to California, and have lived in Redondo Beach for the past ten years.<n>

I had noticed quite a bit of air activity that day. It was more than the usual touch and go&#39;S that occured everday. I attended Niceville High School , located not far from the base. My father picked me up from my sisters house and as we were driving off the base heading to our home in Fort Walton Beach we saw a saucer shaped object that was traveling at a high rate of speed just over the tree tops. It was being followed by two F-4s ..also traveling at a high rate of speed and also very low. As the saucer went across the road it seemed to dissappear as it went over the tree tops on the other side of the highway. At this point the F-4s then climbed back up to a higher altitude. This is my first public mentioning of this..because of the attitude towards people who observe such phenomena.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

I was carrying my toddler daughter (15 months old) out to my car when I noticed what I thought was a small airplane preparing to land at a nearby airfield. I put my daughter in her car seat and started my 1963 Dodge Dart and the non-factory installed car radio came on. When the radio started, I heard three electronic beeping sounds (like a microwave oven beep) and the KRTH-FM music was heard. I drove home, heading south, and parked the car at the curb. As I was getting out of the car, I looked up and saw an object over the house. I shut the car door, and stood in front of the car door, then leaned against it. I saw a dark, non-reflective saucer shaped object, over the roof peak. The object and a red, green and white light along the bottom. The lights did not strobe or twinkle. They were solid in color. Trained as a reporter, I made a mental checklist and started making observations of what the craft looked like and what it did. I noticed the dark metallic color, the lights and the lack of sound. Then I thought I myself, if you are a UFO do something to prove it. At this point, the UFO shot straight up in the air and hovered over the house. It did this three times moving up and down over the house. Also, the mostly full or full moon was to the left of the craft (south of it) and should have backlit the UFO. It did not. The only sound I could hear was faint fanlike sound. I had to strain my ears to hear that. By this time, I started looking for a neighbor&#39;s house to go stay at, but no one was home. I live in housing tract and usually someone is home. I finally got scared, after the third time the craft shot up in the air, and grabbed my daughter to make a run for the house. At the front door I fumbled with my keys but finally managed to get inside the house. I then ran and turned on the television for comfort and heard the final minutes of the Jeopardy game show which would have bee! n around 7:50 p.m. I used this to estimate the time of the UFO sighting. Once inside the house I did go to the back sliding glass door but was afraid to look outside.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was able to give three points of where I saw the UFO and the distance was estimated between 85 to 100 feet. I&#39;m nearsighted so for me to make out the craft, etc. meant that it was close.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The weather was cool, clear with no wind.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The following information was reported to MUFON and they have most of my UFO sightings in the 1980s.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After the incident I suffered from chronic neck and back pain. I still suffer from the pain, although it has abated with time. I did see a doctor about the neck pain approximately one week after the incident.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Before this experience, I was a skeptic of UFOs, but always said I would believe in them, if I ever saw one.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date may be approximate, although the witness does not indicate that fact.

Then it flew  low over my house and I heard the UFO.|7/23/00|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/013/S13394.html|11|ndxe198610| Saw darting object in the night sky, move fast, stop, move fast stop. Then it flew  low over my house and I heard the UFO.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Off in the distance, north/west a jarting lighted object was seen. Stop, jart forward then stop. In a back and forth movement. This object was observed by my 2 children for 3 days. I wouldn&#39;t look until the 3rd day because I thought the kids were making it up. They watched it and kept yelling for me to look. Finally on the 3rd night, I looked and saw it jarting back and forth. Then the shock! It flew right over my house. I could HEAR IT. It whooshed, quiet sound, just like that a whoose. It was right over the house, it looked like a bonnet, the top was flattened and where it flatted to meet the brim, were the lights. All around the brim were individual lights, yellow, blues, and whitish yellow. The lights seemed to go from low beam to high beam constantly, like pulsing lights. When it flew towards my house, I was in shock and got scared. When it was above the house, it was hard to tell the size,it was more than 3 houses long and a block wide, and I could hear it. I called the police when I saw it off in the distance, but they treated me like a moron. This siting was never in the news or the papers. 8 years later in the local paper, someone asked about seeing it, and the reporter said, yes the whole town had reported it. So, maybe you have other reports of it. I have for years been trying to find someplace to report it and hope to god, I have found the right spot. This was definately, a UFO, and hearing it is something I have not heard anyone else report hearing, only seeing. The sound of this UFO was a whoooooosh, a quiet sound, no motor sound, not an airplane sound. More like waving a stick in the air, but this was quiet, hugh sound. It&#39;s speed was fast, it moved from the distance to over my house in a split second. Yet, slow enough for me to see the lights, and hear it. All my windows were closed, not double paned windows, so sounds can be heard. Amazing, frightening and I am very angry at this city repressing the sighting. If you were to question this city, I know you would hear from everyone that saw it. I saw it in the north/west and when it came toward me and flew over my house that would have been south.<n>

It was at dusk in October of 86, I was going out that evening to se a friend of mine. As I left the house to walk to my car i saw a bright yellow light about 100 yards in the feild across from my house. I figured someone over in that area had new street light, but it was like a brighter yellow than any of the other lights in that area. It was close to a sub division, so i dismissed it. As I got in my car &amp; pulled out of the drive way, the &#34;light&#34; came tward the car. As I traveld up the road I lived on the object traveld with me, along side my car! I drove up the street about a mile, I could see that the object was disc shaped, silver, with the light coming from the underside of the object. I had to navigate up a hill, &amp; when I did, The object shot stright up at a unbeliveable high rate of speed. At that piont I could see under it. It was round now with a series of blueish lights. Being shook up at this piont, I drove a quarter of a mile to a church &amp; stop my car. I got out &amp; sat on the hood &amp; was smoking a cigerate. Thinking about what I had seen. As I sat there, a few minuites later I saw this disc again. This time it was decending back to earth, &amp; disappered behind a set of trees. It made no noise at all. At this piont I could of done 1 or 2 things. I could go back down the road, or get the hell out of there &amp; take the highway. I got the hell out of there.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is October 1986 is approximate.  PD))<n>

Taichung is in central Taiwan and accessible to the whole island within a 2 hour drive.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On this particular day, my boss from the USA and I had visited a factory south of the city and were returning to Taichung in the late afternoon via the north/south freeway.  There is a Taiwan Air Force base near the city (CCK) that was formerly used by the US as a base for flying supplies to Viet Nam, and the freeway passes directly beneath the final part of the landing strip and the ocean approach.  The planes on final cross the freeway perhaps 400-500 feet above the ground at this point.  The landing strip itself has two parallel runways and it&#39;s common for fighter type airplanes to land 2 at the same time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As we approached the flight path area, two F-104G fighters were crossing the flight path directly in front of us preparing to land.  Directly behind one of the F-104&#39;s was and oval shaped object, about the same length as the F-104 (maybe 30 feet long), dull silver in color and perhaps 10-15 feet thick at the thickest part.  It was perhaps 10-15 feet behind the tailpipe of the airplane.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In an instant, the object flew off at a right angle, and as luck would have it, directly in my line of sight.  It just got smaller and smaller and disapeared in an instant into a clear sky with good visibility on the ground.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;m pushing 70 now and haven&#39;t mentioned this experience to anyone since I saw it, since I didn&#39;t want anyone to think I was a nutcase.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;ve had a life long interest in aviation and earned a private pilot license back in the early &#39;60&#39;s.  Because of this, I watch the sky a lot and see many things that others don&#39;t see.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;ve had another sighting in the sky over Los Angeles that I&#39;ll write about some other time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting  is approximate.

I could clearly see small broken glimpses of it but never saw the whole object. After the object got 6 blocks away, it made a 90 degree turn directly North. It passed directly over me at approx. 50 feet.

Radio request for sighters<n> <n><n> <n><n> Driving to Atlanta from Charleston, S.C. I took backroad short-cuts to 1-20 starting at Summerville, S.C. Sometime after Orangeburg in the dark country side, we noted at least four orange lit shapes following along side the vehicle over fields to our right. On the left was forested area. These orange lit shapes continued along side the car and mimicked the speed of the vehicle, alternating in height and distance from our vehcile throughout this time. At Batesville,S.C., I took a left onto I-20 Westbound towards Augusta, GA.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The lights were then on our left again (South). After about 30 minutes West Bound we came upon a group of vehicles stopped along both sides of I-20 E and W bound, people were out of their cars watching as these lights danced up and down over crop fields. They [the lights] were extremely close, hovered, regained height. We did not stop to get out of car.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The next morning upon arrival in Atlanta there was a request on a local radio station for anyone who had seen these lights to call in. I called my friend and said : &#34;do NOT call that number&#34;.  We were both frightened we had seen something we were not supposed to know about. It has been rumored for many years there is a secret AF Base in this area, although I have never found it.  This is also in the General Area of the Savannah River Nuclear Plant - back roads surrounding this area are very sparsely populated to this day. While on the back road to Batesville, these lights were definitely fo! llowing our car, and were often at a distace of aprox. 200 yards. These light colors ranged from a dark umber to a soft orange. If I sped up, they did too! We were the only car on this road for many miles, through argicultual farm land &amp; swamp areas. If the road went down, so did the lights and shapes - we did not have to crane our necks to look up to see this event.  Neither did the people from the cars on the Interstate we encountered some time later.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))<n>

It was similar in size and brightness to a large crimson one I&#39;d seen before on the back of a helicopter, but whatever it was made absolutely no noise whatsoever. I looked closely, but couldn&#39;t see any type or shape of an aircraft body, just the round, unblinking light. It then suddenly stopped swinging back and forth, remaining motionless for a second and then began slowly moving to the right in a straight line into a cloud bank. When it hit the clouds, the light turned to green, and then gold and then back to red again. It then disappeared into the clouds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I called the local TV station and reported it when I got home, and asked the anchorwoman that actually answered the phone if anyone else had called in . She said &#39;&#34;No, you&#39;re the only one&#34;&#39;. Another newsperson semi-jokingly reported it later on the air on the eleven o&#39;clock news.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About a week later I saw the following article in the newspaper ( I kicked myself for not cutting it out at the time!), and then realized that there were other witnesses besides myself that had seen this object on or about the same time that I did. Mine was the Tuesday night sighting because I was taking a Tuesday-Thursday college class at the time, and we had just gotten out of class and were getting ready to leave when I spotted it. I found the article again recently listed online, so I thought I&#39;d include it for historical reference:  Mystery Lights Return To Saratoga  By Kathy Holub  Mercury News Staff Writer  A beautiful apparition has been glowing in the night sky over Saratoga ,leaving viewers baffled and entranced. About 15 people, all agog, called Santa Clara County dispatchers on Tuesday night to report a mysterious bright red light that hovered in thesky from 8:15 to 8:30 and then disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Dozens of callers described a similar phenomenon on Oct. 16, same time, same place.&#34;It was very exciting,&#34; said ((name deleted)) of Los Gatos, who watched last week&#39;s display during a break in her real estate class at West Valley College.&#34;It was very bright, much larger than the lights you see on airplanes. At one point, something burning or flickering dropped from it. It was just a tiny little flicker that came down. We all went: `Oooh, what was that?&#39;&#34;  No one seems to know.<n> <n><n> <n><n> That includes ((name #2 deleted)) of Saratoga, who spied the object Tuesday night while lounging with her husband in their backyard spa.Yauger said the light appeared high in the northwestern sky, first moving toward them, then away. Through her binoculars, the apparition became a cluster of lights. &#34;It was scary. When it started get- ting larger, it seemed to be coming down,&#34; she said. Yauger didn&#39;t see the object fade from view because she had just gone into the house. Her husband told her the light turned green and slowly disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Spokesmen at Moffett Field Naval Air Station said nothing flew out of their airfield Tuesday that looked like that. And officials at Vandenberg Air Force Base in Lompoc said they didn&#39;t launch a thing Tuesday night. Ditto for Oct.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 15.Other watchers of the night sky - air traffic controllers and astronomers at Lick Observatory - said they saw nothing unusual.<n>

I looked up at through my clearstory windows. I saw a row of5 bright lights in a v shape coming very slowly over my house. I ran out to my back deck and watched the lights approach. As the lights got closer, I could see the bottom of the craft they were attached to. It seemed to be traveling at a very slow speed and made absolutely no sound. It blocked out the stars as it passed overhead. It was extremely large, the size of a football field and it was chevron-shaped. It looked like a gigantic stealth bomber. I could tell from the lights on the front, that the bottom looked to be a gunmetal gray. It passed through the woods behind my house and headed east. After about 5 minutes, a friend who lived over in that direction called me to tell me her husband was outside looking at the same exact thing. I know it was initially stated that this was a hoax perpetrated by ultralights. This was NOT a formation of ultralights. It was a massive solid object that, as I stated, blocked out the stars as it went overhead. I have been wanting to report this story for years but didn&#39;t know where to do it. I know several people have reported seeing a similiar object in the lower Hudson Valley area and after a little research, I have discovered it was even given the name &#34;The Westchester Wing&#34;.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date of the event may be approximate.

A couple of weeks before, they had just started the inauguration of the Feast for their patron Saint &#34;La Virgen De Las Mercedes&#34;.  They use fireworks known as sky-rockets, but 1/2 inch think, to start the celebrations.  That night a group of people had assembled in the park, which is located in the center of the town.  My father, who is a photographer, had decided to put his equipment away, at our house, a block away from the park.  A friend of mine noticed a firey stream coming from behind a mountain.  He yelled, &#34;Hey, look!  some kids are shooting sky-rockets from that mountain.&#34;  When we all turned to look, the comet like tail was going up, then it started to decend.  Before we could even breath, a circular object was directly above us, blinking the most vivid assortment of colors I have ever seen.  Then it dissapeared leaving a yellow light heading to our right, which evaporated slowly.<n>

I looked over past the house nextdoor and saw something that looked like multi color gasses. ( like the Northern lights) However it appeared to be on the other side of the neighbors house and colse to the ground. I turned to tell my friend to look but, before he turned around it was gone. Shortly after this, maybe a couple of months I had another strange thing happen to me. I left a frien of mine at a local bar to take another frien to pick up her car. I had NOT been drinking,as I was due to have a baby in a few months. We drove apx. 15 min. to my house to pick up her car. She was going home. I was going back to be with my other friend I had left at the bar. I pulled right behind my friend and we started to drive from my house. (she had a old beat up car and usaly drove slower than the speed limit. I had a little sporty car and usaly drove a bit above the limit.) At the end of my street there was a stop sign. I stoped there to light a cigarette. When I turned to follw my friend she was no where in sight. I sped up to catch her. She was no where. I went strait to the bar to get my other friend and she was very upset. It turned out that I had been gone for over 2 hrs. I&#39;m not sure what I believe as far as sightings. I always assumed it was military or other goverment projects. I bought a book on the subject just a week ago and alot of the things I have read apply to symptoms I have had in the years sence. That is how I found your sight. Just trying to get more info. I see here there haven&#39;t been any reports of abductions. Do you think this is crazy or am I reading to much into things that can easily be explained? I see on your sight there are a few reports from the neighborhood I grew up in. I don&#39;t know if this could be connected. Please keep in mind the dates and times here are very apx. as it was such a long time ago it is hard to remember. I just wanted to see if anyone here might be able to answer some of this for me. I don&#39;t care if you put this accou! nt on th e sight or not. My only reason for righting was in hopes to contact someone who knows more on the subject. I am a 3x year old, female ((deleted))l Officer.(ie..have passed West Virginias ((deleted)) test in the process)*grin* Married with four children. I live in a very small town and am not trying to call attintion to myself in any was. Expecialy because of my profession. I would like for this information to be on a need to know basis. I haven&#39;t even told my husband for fear he would think I was going over the deep end. Thanks so much for you time. Even thou I havent told him it is still ok to contact me. Thanks again.<n>
