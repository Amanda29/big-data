1/1/65 20:00|St. Ansgar|IA|Fireball|20 seconds|winter nite wonder|2/1/07|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/054/S54339.html|1|ndxe196501| winter nite wonder<n> <n><n> <n><n> The black top I was traveling was and still to this day is elevated 5ft. above the fields.Around 20:00 hrs (8:00 p.m.)Heading north,on my left side,i noticed a ball of fire grow from out of no where into a beatiful redish/orange color that intermixed with in itself.This energy/fireball glowed but did not light up the ground or area .This wonder stayed exactly to my left and same speed as i was driving(60mph).It stayed at this beatiful intentness and colors for 10 seconds max.,then dissapeared (went out??) as fast as it appeared.After maybe 6-7 seconds,to my supprize,again the same occourance happened as the first mentioned above.This time the brightness and color hit the same max as before for about 2-3 seconds-then intensified way beyond anything i had ever seen before,but could look at it. As i was thinking,just how big and bright will this thing become,it left at a rate of speed,that is not possible from anything on our earth.It went forward and up and out of sight in 2 seconds.Looking at it,the size would be compaired to a soccor ball at arms length.This object glowed redish orange.No actual structor was noticed.Just a intense beatiful color in a fire ball.Maintained with in itself.Nothing abnormal went on with the car.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

We|6/2/98|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/002/S02240.html|2|ndxe196501| Summary : At a drive-in during the summer my brother and I saw three lights above and to the right of the screen.  The movie was &#34;CAT BALOU.&#34; We observed them for approx. 20 minutes while one of them flew figure eights around the other two.  Then one of the other lights would switch positions with the moving light and fly the same figure eight pattern.  Suddenly two of the lights took off with great velocity and dissappeared.  The other light stayed in its orginal position.  Approx. 1 hr. later a light came speeding back and started circling the stationary light then took a position next to it and stopped.  I am at home with my sick child today and watching the learning channel and heard a pilot report a similar sighting.  I finally decided to go public<n>
