4/30/76 20:00|Fricot City|CA|Disk|3 hours|Was reported to national ufo & government|1/24/12|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/086/S86707.html|1|ndxe197604| was reported to national ufo &amp; government<n> <n><n> <n><n> 1976 in the Spring  while living in Fricot Ca. 7 of us witness a Ufo do the most amazing unbelievable things!  About 8p just getting dusk, as we were all standing outside on the patio we watched UFO event which was reported to Sheriff, (who ridiculed her, gave her number for National Ufo center and once again she called and was ridiculed ).<n> <n><n> <n><n> First we spotted an huge orange/yellow burning ball, looked exactly like picture we see of our burning sun, this UFO was stationary and hung  in the dark sky over  a ravine when we first saw it. Next it changed slowly become a dark red glowing ember colored orb with dark lines, then it began to close up on its self  and went from a burning sun/orb to a small bright bright luminescent  light which zipped all over the night sky, instantly changing from a bright bright light to burning sun/orb then back to bright white light. This went on for a couple of hours, we were so fascinated we didn’t notice the time  Then it landed on the hill side across the ravine from our position in Fricote City (which lays on a hill top).  We were so excited we watched for hours.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After the UFO landed across the way from us, it continued to change from Orange/Yellow burning sun to bright bright light and we started to worry it would start a fire in the dry grass it had landed on, although each time it became a bright light or Orange sun you could see the outline or shadows of the Oak trees in that were in between us and  of the UFO.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We continued to watch the UFO until about 11p then I became very very sleepy, then my brother turns to me and tells me he can hardly keep his eyes open either so we go to bed   awaken at day break to the sound of jet engines to find the Air Force and Army Choppers, there were military jeeps and men and others in same place we watched the UFO land the night before.  But I couldn’t seem to care or get excited about all the actions caused by the UFO landing  Quite the opposite of who I really am!! Completely unnatural reaction for me!<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))<n>
4/26/76 03:30|Delta (Canada)|BC|Other|10 minutes|huge green hatbox-shaped cloud hanging without movement or dissipation in sky|5/10/04|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/036/S36744.html|2|ndxe197604| huge green hatbox-shaped cloud hanging without movement or dissipation in sky<n> <n><n> <n><n> I don&#39;t know if this falls into your field of study, but i&#39;m sending it along in case it is of interest.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was 16 and headed home from school across the back field when i noticed something wierd up in the sky. I had a good view of everything from the school to the North Shore Mountains and have always had good eyesight, but couldn&#39;t really fathom what was hanging there... maybe people will laugh but it was a perfectly hatbox-shaped, very minty green cloud, about a mile away and hovering over the city about 2 miles up.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was also huge, covering about 2 miles with it&#39;s shadow with a height of about a mile. The thing looked like some kind of oval hatbox, hanging up there in the sky. And it didn&#39;t move. It had a puffy surface texture that clearly showed an effect of wind, sort of like a knife moving icing, for want of a better description... but the cloud itself looked solid and didn&#39;t move, although a couple of smaller and more normal-looking clouds in the sky were moving along at quite a fast clip. I remember remarking to myself that it was interesting that the wind made no dent in the shape, all the edges were sharp and regular. The whole thing showed an almost perfect symmetry. And the colour! I&#39;d never seen a cloud that was mint GREEN before!  I stood in the middle of the field watching this thing for about 10 minutes. Nothing happened, so i went home.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I felt at the time that this might have been the result of an industrial gas accident but there was nothing on the news. Even if it had been, i wonder why such an emission would have taken on this shape and not dissipated in the wind. Anyone have any explanations?  Never saw anything like it before or since.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  Witness elects to remain semi-anonymous.  PD))<n>
4/25/76 21:00|Brownsville|TN|Circle|1 minute|I saw a wheel within a wheel|5/12/10|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/075/S75330.html|3|ndxe197604| Ironic that it originated from a W/P flight line hanger at a time when it was belived that recovered craft were being stored there.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I Was a member of the ((deleted)) of the USAF at the time, on a TDY at Wright/Patt AFB. in Ohio. This was a daylight sighting. I was positioned overlooking the Airfield of W/P when I noticed a very Bright red (Dot)light in front of one of the hangers by the flight line. within a faction of a second (as if in a burst of energy)I saw coming towards my vantage point and position a circular disk shaped red opaque object climbing in altitude. As the object reached my 2:00 position, it seperated into two disks for a fraction of a second,(long enought time to discerne two distinct objects) and then came back together as one object. It continued traveling eastward towards my vantage point of which ended at about the 12:00 position. At that point my view point was obscured by a tall building. The next day I heard of a report in the local newspaper debunking the sighting as a weather balloon, so, obviously I was not the only spectator! There was no dicernable features other than it&#39;s scarlot red opaque disk shape. The sighting lasted about 10 sec. It was no weather balloon for it traveled at a high rate of speed!<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

It made no sounds and had no distinguishing features.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After a few seconds it as no longer visible to me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was one passenger in the car who also saw the same thing.We agreed not to tell anyone for fear of  being ridiculed but we know that we saw it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.

4/18/76 17:00|Marianna|FL|Oval|aprox  5 sec|the object  was oval shaped and at the tipical attitude of small planes no distinguishing features no sounds|9/2/05|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/045/S45806.html|5|ndxe197604| I witnessed a disk-shaped craft, with colored lights, move very slowly towards the northwest, in Clark County, Kentucky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This event transpired about 30 years ago and I am unsure of the exact date.  It was probably early spring or late autumn of 1976, but I could be off by a year either way.  The temperature was in the low 50&#39;s and the leaves were off the trees, which is why I believe the season was early spring or late fall.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My sister had been out at a bowling alley with a friend of hers, and her friend&#39;s mother.  In the early evening, but well after sunset, she returned home, and burst in through the front door in a state of excitement.  She announced that they had been followed by a UFO while driving to our home (which at that time was a couple of miles out in the country).  I said, &#34;gee, I wish I&#39;d seen it&#34;, to which she replied, &#34;well, you probably still can.  Go look out my window!&#34;  I ran to her bedroom, and looked out the window, which faced the northwest...and I could clearly see the disk.  It was about 65 to 70 feet in diameter, and perhaps 5 to 6 feet thick.  It hovered about 150 feet up.  It was moving very slowly, perhaps only 4 mph, roughly toward the northwest.  The disk had lights on its edge; I saw red, green, blue, and white.  They lit up in sequence, moving from right to left along the edge of the craft.  Because of the timing of the lights, I gained the impression that the lights would have been present all around the disk, but I only saw the edge that was facing me.  Each light would blink on for about a 1/2 second, then off, and its neighbor to the left would blink on, etc.  The night was clear and my view of the craft was quite sharp, but I did not perceive any other features of the craft besides the lights. At no time did I hear any sound from the craft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The disk continued to recede away from me, toward the northwest.  I watched it for perhaps 5 minutes, and then I left the room.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have had an acute interest in military aircraft since early childhood, and I know enough about aircraft to realize that this was not an airplane or a jet, and it certainly wasn&#39;t a weather balloon.  It was travelling at a rate far below the stall speed of any normal aircraft, hardly greater than the normal walking pace of a human.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

4/15/76 20:30|Winchester|KY|Disk|5 minutes?|I witnessed a disk-shaped craft, with colored lights, move very slowly towards the northwest, in Clark County, Kentucky.|10/30/06|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/052/S52121.html|6|ndxe197604| It was a silver rectangle just sitting still in the daylight sky<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was about 1:30 in the afternoon in the sping of 1976. I was farming at the time and had just finished dinner. I was walking across a pasture, next to a county road, to get back to the tractor. It was a hot sunny day. In the due East sky at appx: 11:00 in the sky, I saw a very silver or metallic colored rectangle. It was in the sky and not moving when I noticed it. This was so real that I was trying to wave down traffic that was traveling due West, so they could also see what I was seeing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After a few seconds, from the lower right quarter of the ufo, what looked like, (for lack of a better discription,) an upside down umbrella came from the ufo and started a slow back and forth descent. After another second or two the whole thing just disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date is approximate.  PD))<n>
4/15/76 13:30|Americus|GA|Rectangle|20 sec|It was a silver rectangle just sitting still in the daylight sky|4/16/05|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/043/S43108.html|7|ndxe197604| Have  not talked about this for years until now after seeing how the goverment keeps saying ufos are`nt real  then why keep quiet.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was a S.A.T. leader of a three man Air Force Security Police team in a Alert B-52 site at March AFB Calf.. We were giving a chow break to the three K-9 units at the end of the alert area in the grass next to runway. all the sudden the dogs went wild barking and then crying out like they were in pain,you could smell the air like after alighting strike,at the same time we got a call from the alarm monitor telling us that the ;maid miles; system had dedected a large metal object pass the runway right in front of us. then the humming sound so loud it hurt our hears started almost right above us,we looked up and saw three teardrop shaped objects two were higher than the one that was right above us. they all gave off alight green shine that seemed to pulse, the hair on your skin and head was pulled up like with static charge. The radios wouldnt work and everyone started to point there m-16s at the object. All the sudden a bright light flashed from the object then it moved away from us. the other two rose straight up and then shot off in a easterly direction going towards the mountions then straight up into the sky. The last one rose up but started west then turned east and shot off into the sky. I started calling my controller and the tower who said he did have something for a few seconds but it was moving to fast and was gone before he could get a fix. We made our reports and were told talk to nobody!!! Was called in and told that as a matter of National Security We saw a low flying plane.That because we were in a Nuclear Weapons area that this whole thing never happen. Funny thing it was all the news that next day , we heard that two chps had saw the objects near San Berdeno area 10miles away,  and a news copper covering a story in Riverside had saw three objects traveling southeast the same direction of the Base. Even stranger was the phone call two days later from my father in Ga, where he lived after retiring from the Air force .&#34; son listen to your Boss It could be your chance at staying in the Air force remember what you see keep it to yourself &#34; .I never asked why or whats going on my father Had a Eye`s only clearance in the Air Force. Someone did however talk to the inqrirer news paper.<n>
