Our ages ranged from 11 to 14 I was the first to notice the craft. I look west and said &#34;look everyone what is that&#34;. They thought I was pulling their legs. But as soon as they saw the craft  their attitude changed. The craft was just above the pecan trees. A circular light that was I guess about 50 feet in diameter. It glowed white light. No other lights were on the craft. It did not seem to light up the area. It was completely silent. It was traveling slowly. It passed direcly over us. It seem to be losing altitude very slowly. It passed over my house toward the back yard. My friend ran to his house a half block from my house to get his binoculars. When he got there the craft was stopped over his house. It hovered for a few seconds he said and then shot off at high speed toward the north. The rest of us did not see it shoot off. I live 30 miles away from an army flight training center and I am familiar with aircraft. This craft was in no way familiar to me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

3/21/70 20:00|Camp Pendleton|CA|Disk|15-20 minutes|While using night vison scopes , 28 Marines witness 3 saucer craft hovering near Camp Pendleton rifle range during night firing exersi|7/5/05|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/044/S44702.html|2|ndxe197003| While using night vison scopes , 28 Marines witness 3 saucer craft hovering near Camp Pendleton rifle range during night firing exersi<n> <n><n> <n><n> A group of about 23 Marines were in training at the Scout Sniper School On the Camp Pendleton Marine Base,(Camp Horno), I believe, which is a few miles East of San Clemente Ca. We were about 2-3 miles or so NE of Camp Horno On a night firing range where we were scheduled to do a familarization fire on a 200 meter course at 1/2 size silhouette targets using M-16 Rifles with Starlite scopes mounted on them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was a 1st Lt., a 1st Sgt.,and a Cpl.(troop handler) in charge of the training. Three squads of Marines were lined up behind three bench rest positions and there were three Rifle and Starlite Scopes to be used for the firing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was just getting dark enough to shoot when one of the Marines in my squad called me to the front of the line and pointed with his finger to what appeared(with the naked eye ) to be a star in a northerly direction just above the horizon. It looked like it was approximately 1-3 miles away.The &#34;star&#34; appeared to be changing colors like the twinkling effect of a star that you might see on any given night. The weather was clear and the stars were out and was providing good ambient light to enable us to see astonishing detail as we viewed what was vey plainly a saucer craft that was hovering slightly above a small mountain peak in the distance. Using the Starlite Scope(1X or 2x,), the craft appeared quite close. It was a classic saucer shape,dark in color, like black graphite,not shiny; similar to what the Stealth Aircraft of the 90&#39;s looked like. There were no visible landing gear,or other protuberances of any kind, nor were there any apparent &#34;hatches&#34; or doors, entrances etc. visible.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The most noticible thing about the saucer was the five portholes and the bright light eminating from them,and the turret (not dome), that was slowly rotating counter clockwise. The portholes were an estimated 20 feet apart, and appeared to be tinted.  The portholes were eminating bright light in various colors; red,blue green, amber(or yellow), and white.  The source of the light was a very powerful beam emitter similar to a brillant light house beacon, and appeared to be stationary in the approximate center of the craft. The twinkling effect seemed to be due to the revolving of the turret which caused the tinted portholes to eminate the various colors described;however,through the scope we could not only clearly see the different colored portholes. We could see through them into the interior of the craft as well.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The interior of the craft was consistent in symmetry to the shape of the craft&#39;s outward apparence.  The walls were curved, rounded and the floor was flat but the interesting fact was that there was no visible control center; no consoles, instruments,desks, chairs, or items,objects or property --nothing at all.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We could only see into the right side of the craft; perhaps 49% of the interior space from our angle of observation.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After about 5-10 minutes the craft went down behind the peak and stayed there about 5 minutes.  Just about the the time we were ready to start firing, the craft rose back up above the peak.  A short time later two more of the saucers,identical in appearance to the first, rose up, one on each side of the first craft, only lower in the sky, forming a triangular shaped formation. All three of the saucers moved slowly accross the sky to the East and then stopped. The first saucer started moving now SE at an increasing rate of speed until it reached a &#34;pivot-point&#34; and shot off in a reverse angle,of about 45% to the west at an incredibly fast speed; much faster than the military jets of the day(F-4 Phantoms and A-6 Intruders).<n> <n><n> <n><n> When the craft hit the atmosphere  the front of it starting giving off tremendous sparks and a tail of fire like a comet 3-4 times the length of the saucer, trailed behind it. About 30 seconds later it was out of sight. The outher two craft repeated the same manuever and disappeared at the same point in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> During the observation of these saucer craft no noise was heard coming from them at any time. The area that they were in, while on or near the ground, was in a restricted area, possibly an artillary impact area. The craft displayed speeds of travel that were far in excess of any known aircraft in existence then or now and performed turning manuevers that were, according to my knowledge never seen before and even now years later.  The technological capability displayed by these craft I believe far exceeds anything I know to exist on earth.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As a group we did not talk about what we saw since we were seriously concentrating on our training which was preparing for Vietnam. After the last saucer was gone, one of the Marines asked our Lt. if he was going to report the incident. He replied: Do you f---ing think I&#39;m crazy ?<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of the event is approximate.  PD))<n>
3/20/70 16:00|Fort Worth|TX|Disk|10 minutes|Scintillating silvery, metallic object, probably disk-shaped, apparently changing attitude|3/29/04|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/035/S35880.html|3|ndxe197003| Scintillating silvery, metallic object, probably disk-shaped, apparently changing attitude<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was standing on the crest of a hill above my parent&#39;s house (in Fort Worth, Texas), looking northwards, on 20 March 1970 (approximate date) at about 4:00 PM (I was 13 years old at the time). I would sometimes look for air traffic from Carswell Air Force, to my west, from this vantage point. The sky was clear. There was no air traffic in my immediate field of view.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I noticed a silvery, metallic object about 30 degrees above the horizon, due north. It appeared to be elliptical, but was probably disk-shaped (1). The object was perhaps two degrees in size, measured along its horizontal axis, and appeared to be fairly distant (there were no physical points of reference that would allow me to judge the size or distance of the object). The outline of the object&#39;s surface was distinct. I might not have noticed the object had it not changed its physical appearance while I was watching it. It appeared to scintillate or &#34;wink&#34;, causing the object briefly to &#34;disappear&#34;, or at least become difficult to see. For the duration of the observation, the object did not move horizontally or vertically from its position, nor did it appear to change size. I presumed from this that the object was spatially motionless. I could detect no sound from the object, although this may have been a function of the object&#39;s possible distance from me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> (1) I could not, at the time, account for the object&#39;s scintillation, although I thought it might have been due to some kind of movement. I now believe the object was in fact disk-shaped, having an apparent elliptical shape due to the oblique angle at which I was viewing it. I also now believe that the object&#39;s scintillation, or &#34;winking&#34;, was the result of the object changing its attitude relative to my position. If, for example, the object had been shifting its attitude (relative to me, the observer) by, say, plus/minus 45 degrees along its horizontal axis, it might have appeared to be a scintillating ellipse.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I observed the object for perhaps 10 minutes, after which I could no longer visually resolve it in the fairly bright sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Had the object been a conventional fixed-wing or rotor-winged aircraft, I believe I would have been able to track its movement from its (apparent) rest position to a point in the sky where it would have been obscured by some intervening object or would have gone below my field of view. It was not a lighter-than-air vehicle (e.g., a blimp or weather balloon), as I had seen these in Fort Worth before and was familiar with their appearance in the sky. It was not a missile, as I was also familiar with their appearance in the sky. The fact that the object appeared to loiter also presents some difficulties with its being a conventional aircraft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object did not appear to be any meteorological phenomenon - at least none with which I was or am familiar. It was also not an astronomical phenomenon. The sky was far too bright to have allowed stars to be seen and, as we all know, planets do not scintillate.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object could have been some type of experimental vehicle. Working for a major manufacturer of advanced (read classified) air vehicles, though, I do not believe this would have been the case. If for no other reason, disk-shaped structures are difficult to control aerodynamically with current technology. It is also difficult to explain why an experimental (or conventional) air vehicle would want to change its attitude in the manner this object appeared to have.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am 46 years old. I live in Los Angeles, CA. I studied astronomy and physics as an undergraduate and have two Master&#39;s degrees (although not in physics or astronomy). As I mentioned above, I work for an aerospace company, selling manned and unmanned air vehicles and systems.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>
3/15/70 22:00|Castlegar (Canada)|BC|Light|2-3 minutes|HBCCUFO CANADIAN REPORT:  At least seven, emerged from the light and were flying around the still stationary larger object.|3/17/04|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/035/S35488.html|4|ndxe197003| I was 12 years old and I was at the old Castlegar arena about 10:00 p.m. waiting for my brother to finish a hockey practice. I went outside the arena with my mother and a friend of hers. We walked to a coffee shop about 1/2 mile away. While on the way back, we all noticed a very bright light in the sky. It was a cool clear night in mid-March. The object was extremely bright. It sort of was going straight and slow for about 20 seconds, then made a very sudden turn to the right. It suddenly stopped after a few more seconds. It was quite high up it seemed - 2-3 miles? At that point, several smaller lights or objects - I counted at least seven, emerged from the light and were flying around the still stationary larger object. The objects eventually made their way across the sky away from view. Total time - about 2-3 minutes. We were all quite puzzled by the event. On a side note - I remember we were talking with my mom&#39;s friend and her husband a few weeks later when they were over for dinner. He told us when he was with the US military in the early 1970&#39;s, he was a radar operator responsible for an area in the US mid-west. He used to track objects on the screen flying at extreme speeds - but he was also warned to ignore them and to keep his mouth shut. He was convinced from our descriptions, that what we saw was definitely not a normal aircraft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Brian Vike, Director HBCC UFO Research Home - Phone 1 250 845 2189 email: hbccufo@telus.net Website: http://www.hbccufo.com<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We express our gratitude to Brian Vike for submitting this report.

There were no lights on in surrounding houses.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In the small valley where my dad&#39;s house was located, I saw a light come over the hill.  This light proceeded in an oblong route - only stopping at the top of large pine trees periodically.  When at top of the pine trees, it would turn off and on about every 3-4 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At this time I awoke my mother to see this thing.  I passed in front of the windowabout five (5) feet away. At this time , I observed that it was about four feet long - and about the size of a flourescent light bulb.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Behind the object it appeared to give off an exhaust of light.  The object was traveling about 5 mph.  Although the light appeared intense, it didn&#39;t seem to illuminate objects it passed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;ve wondered all these years what his was. . .a probe. .. ?  I&#39;d appreciate hearing if any other reports have encountered such an object.<n>
3/10/70 00:00|St. Petersburg|FL|Disk|less than hour|Encounter with disked shape UFO on campus of Florida Presbyterian College with 30 others|2/14/08|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/061/S61361.html|6|ndxe197003| Encounter with disked shape UFO on campus of Florida Presbyterian College with 30 others<n> <n><n> <n><n> This happened on the campus of Eckerd College (then called Florida Presbyterian College) in St. Petersburg, Florida. Don&#39;t remember the exact date, sometime in 1970, I believe in the spring.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There were about 30 of us watching a movie, &#34;The African Queen&#34; in the Student Union in the middle of campus. The movie was over around midnight, and we all walked out of the building. There, hovering approximately 20 feet above the ground in the open area near the Student Union, was a disk shaped, grey metallic craft. It was not small, I&#39;m guessing approx. 50 feet wide. It had red lights in a band around the middle of the craft. It was completely silent, and was not moving.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had the feeling that time stopped, we all stopped moving, stood where we were, as if frozen in time. No one said a word. I don&#39;t know how much time past. The next thing I remember is that the craft lifted straight up, made a perpendicular movement, then straight up again, and was gone. Its speed was faster than one could even imagine. No acceleration time, it was at a standstill, then gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> No one said a word, we all just walked back to our dorm rooms on campus. This was very out of character, because this was a very &#34;radical&#34; 60&#39;s type college, with a very verbal student body! I was walking back to my dorm with a friend, and were walking very slowly, as if walking through mud. I said to her, &#34;Maybe we should tell someone&#34; and she said &#34;No, don&#39;t bother&#34;. When I got to my dorm, I called the TV station (left a message) and the police (who didn&#39;t believe me).<n> <n><n> <n><n> That was it. No one ever spoke about it. I forgot about it almost immediately. Then I started remembering it in detail around 20 years later. This was the only time in my life I saw a &#34;UFO&#34;.<n> <n><n> <n><n> If any of the 30 people who shared this experience with me that night in 1970 on the campus of Florida Presbyterian College also remembers this event, please report it on this site.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.  We would welcome reports from the other witnesses.  PD))<n>
