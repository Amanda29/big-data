He had told us to look out the window above the lake and i did due to boy friend being in tub at that point in tme.  when i had looked out side my bay window i had seen a bell shape craft with a red light on the bottom amd white lights rapidly blinking around the edge of the craft.  It had moved from my boyfriends father&#39;s home (15-18 min.&#39;s driving time away) to the lake out front of my home in a matter of 1 min..  My boyfriend had then hopped out of the tub and looked out of the side door and seen the craft as well.  At that point in time we had heard a vibrating sound followed by a faint beeping sound.  the craft had moved very very very fast.  My boyfriend father had seen it again in a mtter of a min or so and said that his wife and him had seen it again and it turned bright red then white then it had shot up and disappeared into the sky.   about 3-4 min.&#39;s later he had said that there was another craft that was a little smaller and it had droped straight down from the sky and it had looked like an airplane had just fell. then all of a sudden it to had taken off into the sky. it is now 12:12 am and i have been looking out side from time to time and i have not seen nothing again.

4/30/02 22:04|Woodinville|WA|Chevron|5 seconds|Silent boomerang shaped craft without lights|5/14/02|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/022/S22741.html|2|ndxe200204| Silent boomerang shaped craft without lights<n> <n><n> <n><n> My 2 other roommates and I were outside on our back porch/deck, sitting down on our patio furniture looking up at the stars in the sky, when suddenly one of my roommates interjected, &#34;Hey, look at that!!!&#34;  The boomerang-shaped object had no visible lights but was clearly distinguishable from the night sky, as if it was metallic/reflective/or light-colored.  It silently sailed in a straight line in a SSE (south south easterly) direction for no more than what could have been 5 seconds.  If my attention had not been drawn to the object I would had never noticed it!  The sky was mostly clear, but there were a few clouds.  The object disappeared from view into a cloud, so I&#39;m going under the assumption the object had to have been up several thousand feet.  The relative size of the object I believe was large (i.e. larger than your commercial jet plane), relative to the size or a quarter or a tad bit smaller in perspective and appeared to have been traveling at a constant, high rate of speed (15-degrees of the sky in a manner of those fleeting seconds.)  Also, it is important to note that the &#34;V&#34; of the boomerang was the front of the craft as it was moving.  The wing tips were rounded and it really did have an overall pronounced boomerang shape, not as sharp as a 90-degree angle, I would have to say it had a 120-degree angle to it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I do not believe this was a stealth bomber; I have seen pictures of the stealth and this did not have the wider midsection of a stealth bomber with the notches.  The craft my roomates and I saw almost had the appearance of a glider, it had no larger/wider area where a cockpit would be in the &#34;V&#34;.  By all recollections the craft had no distinguishing marks on it, except for one of my roommates, she professes that she could make out a thin, black band that laterally ran across it (the band running along the front side of the craft, the side of the boomerang moving forward).<n>
4/30/02 21:45|Kelowna (Canada)|BC|Other|1 minute|Delta or 'V' shaped object, moving silently, unlit aside from surrounding light sources moving south to north|5/14/02|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/022/S22699.html|3|ndxe200204| Delta or &#39;V&#39; shaped object, moving silently, unlit aside from surrounding light sources moving south to north<n> <n><n> <n><n> looking at jupiter with my son, we both notice something very faint pass in front of our view.  What little was visible of it resembled a delta, or &#39;V&#39; shaped object.  Very little detail could be made of it, some very very dimly visible leading edges giving the impression of the delta shape.  my son thought it was a plane, but there were &#39;zero&#39; lights present on the object.  I personally thought it might be a hang glider, but it is two hours past sundown and cooling dramatically outside.  Besides...it seemed awfully high.  it followed a south to north path pretty well perfectly.  no sound was present at all, and flew at an estimated/guesstimated 10,000 feet.  Don&#39;t quote me on that altitude as size was an issue to determine.  I thought it could have been the ISS, but checking the position of the station found it to be only &#39;approaching&#39; the western coasts of S.America and following the wrong course for what we saw.  If it was a plane it was running silent and dark.  If it was a hang glider it should have been dropping fairly quickly in suburban areas.  Either way it was unlit, V shaped, and very quiet.  A stealth fighter flying without lights or sound??<n>

It hovered for a moment, let out a little whine, and then shot off. It left a low lying contrail, but that vanished in a moment. We saw it flashing a tiny light at the bottom of the craft, which was sort of a beam, but that was about it.<n>

My guess is about 18 thousand feet high.   Clear night sky at approximately 011:30, object was elongated at 1&#34; at arms length.  Very bright pulsing large lights.  One red in front and one white in rear. I could see the light lens in between pulsing at rear.   Did anyone see this?<n>

I am a 23 year old ((profession deleted)) who lives in the Greenlake area of Seattle, WA. I have lived in Seattle for close to five years.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was looking at the eastern horizon/sky for a moment at around ten minutes to 10:00 PM on Monday evening (April 29), when I saw a bright green light zip down across the sky towards the horizon (at a twenty degree angle) from above and North. The light was vey bright (although far away) and didn&#39;t leave any sort of trail even though it was traveling amazingly fast. So fast that it was gone in a second or two. I described it&#39;s size first as 1/15th the size of the moon, but after more thought I think a more accurate description would be four times the size of the North Star.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was a very curious sight that I am glad I was able to witness.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with this witness, and he sounded quite credible.

Some of them move just a little, others move across the city, but all look the same.  They are silverish spheres with light emanating from different areas of surface.  They sometimes have round indentions, black holes or spots, or raised areas.  They often change shape and appear cut off at top or bottom, and sometimes even look egg shaped.  Looking through a 700mm telescope, they almost fill the lens and often change appearance while looking at them.  Some pulse and flash almost continuously, others emulate private planes, others simply twinkle with different colors.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Myself, friends and family have been watching these &#34;ships&#34; since approx. July of last year.  At first just one, a red one.  Now there are many here in sky at night.  They start to appear at sunset, and then move lower in sky later in evening.  This has continued for months and these object don&#39;t appear to really be hiding.  I have flashed them often with mag light and they always flash me back.  Sometimes they even move closer after they are signaled.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have filed numerous reports with MUFON, but never received one reply.  I cannot help but wonder why.  Has anyone else out these seen these crafts/ships?<n>

Appeared to be coming down between Bellevue and Issaquah.  It descended in a slight arc trajectory at approximately 50 degrees.  It noticeably increased in brilliance from pale green to neon green as it descended. It also increased in velocity as it descended.  No impact was observed and no sound was heard.  It is my opinion that it was either a meteorite or piece of returning space junk.  The image and color was spectacular.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with this witness, and he sounded quite credible to us.  The report was passed along to astronomers.

I was taking in the planet Jupitor or Saturn trying to see how many planets I could see. I get the two mixed up of which is brighter. Suddenly three light came out of nowewhere while I was looking to the West.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The three lights were moving at a high rate of speed in a West to East direction. The lights made up a triangular formation. My hous is a large house and my visual range is very good from my second and third floor decks. I saw the lights probably 1-2 miles away. The lights which were in a very distictive triangle mad no sound and was traveling at least 400 mph. I know this because I can see the jets entering for final for North bound land trafic from my house.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As the lights passed over I noticed very distinctive crosses for each light. Each ligh looked like it was one of the sun flare crosses if you took a picture fith a cross hair lense on a camera. The lights seemed to apear a bluish color with a golden yellow center where the lines crossed. Each light was an individual cross and sepereated equally in a very clear triangular form if one was to conect the lights together.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As the lights passed over there was no sound, you could not see a ship of any type, though the space between the lights did not look like normal night sky. The altitude appeared to be about 6000 feet to 4000 feet. I watched the lights travel to the East for aproxamatly 6 seconds looking for some kind of tail section or visual rear of a craft. The lights just simply disapeared. The craft simply vanished as if it were extremly thin or moved so quickly I could not see it any more. Incredible speed in comparison of a jet.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Within 10 seconds I visually was watching come into view in the area a large size jet bound for Seatac Airport on final. The lights of the jet were moving much slower than the craft which I was watching. Knowing Seatac landing patterns and altitudes for this kind of jet aircraft what I was watching was not a regualr aircraft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I understand night flying, I have been a pilot for 18 years and flying since I was 7.I am 41 now. I have loged over 450 hours of day and night flying. I have never ever seen any thing like this before. I am a science teacher here in Tacoma and I teach about planets and the night sky. I understand and know what is normal. This was not normal.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The weather tonight was totally clear, with a temperature around 50 degrees and no visual fog or moisture in the air. On a clear day I can see Mt Rainier, and the cascade range. The craft would have been over the cascades in seconds at the rate it was moving. I consistantly watch aircraft traveling and turning into SeaTac for landings. This craft should have been visible to the aircraft that was heading north and a second aircraft which apeared shortly after the first. The three light should have been in Radar space of both McHord Airforce base and SeaTacs Air space and should have been picked up on radar. The craft clearly was cuting accross in front of the large jet heading Northeast.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I wrote all that I could quickly as possible to atleast have some written record.<n>
4/28/02 22:15|Harrison & Mt.Plesent (between)|MI|Rectangle|10min|I would'nt have believed it, I can only try and explain what we saw.|5/14/02|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/022/S22672.html|10|ndxe200204| I would&#39;nt have believed it, I can only try and explain what we saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am not a freak, but if I hadn&#39;t of seen this last night I would think that it was a freak that wrote this. My husband (a well educated person) and I (an accountant) were traveling on highway 27 between Harrison and Mount Pleasant Michigan. We just left his brothers house near Crystal Lake going home to Livonia. We were discussing a quiz from my accounting class about ethics. The radio was off, and all I had on was my little flashlight (one of those small ones that help you find your lock on your door at night). I was reading an article to him from the New York Times, when we both looked out my window (looking West), and noticed two strobe lights on what looked like a long wing about four bus lengths apart from each other flashing three times each but at different times with no hesitation between the flashes from one side to the next. My husband said he noticed the lights reflecting on the car and I noticed the flashes from my peripheral vision. The first thing I thought of was the stealth, except it was longer and not what I would imagine the stealth to look like (granted I have never seen a stealth). The object was silent, but our windows were up, but we didn&#39;t hear anything! It was about 150feet high, no higher then 200feet up. It went right over our car from a bit south but more West to East South, and it was going around (best guess) 120-150 miles an hour. My husband asked as it went over to watch it, which I did, and noticed that its left strobe light turned off, it made a decent and disappeared for about 15sec maybe 20. I told my husband that it appeared to have landed in a thicket of trees but I couldn&#39;t be sure. When it suddenly showed up again and flying very fast from where I last saw it going now straight south but then we noticed it had red and blue lights flashing along with the outer white lights and again in a strobe light manner, they were in perfect sequence with each other. The craft went at least three miles in about 2 1/2 to 3 minutes tops. It appeared to land again, when we saw i! t cross the highway going south west again, it was closer then and we couldn&amp;#8217;t explain that (about 1 mile if that away from our car at that point) as we got closer its lights went back to just the white strobe lights on the out side of the wings again, and at this time it was crossing east again in front of us still around a mile ahead of us away. It turned so fast North that it was next to our car again, (drive&#39;s side window) we watched it as it was now behind us around a 1/2 mile back again when we turned off the freeway (m20, Mount Pleasant exit) and stopped our car at the side of the exit ramp, we jumped out of the car and looked up. This thing should have flown over us, there is no doubt in my mind, when it turned from South to West again, it did it in a quick (and I mean quick) U turn and only two BRIGHT lights like car lights steady not blinking now, were coming over a trailer park that was right next to where we were parked now. It had to have been flying around 70 miles per hour (I would estimate) and it should have flown over us, I was standing on the car outside my door (you know that section of the car where the door meets next to your seat?) so I could see it as it went over better and closer. It never went over us, and I SWEAR it should have. My husband and I just looked at each other and asked, &#34;Where did it go!&#34; But we never saw it after that, we stopped at this gas station just about 1 block west from our exit ramp and I got out of the car and looked up while he pumped gas. I must have looked like a freak, but honestly nothing like that has ever happened to either one of us before. I never believed the stories of UFO&#39;s before, my husband has never dismissed the possibility of them, but now I don&amp;#8217;t know what to believe. NOTHING COULD FLY OR TURN THAT FAST!<n>

I as you imagine, I was taken back from what I saw.  I have never seen anything like that before.  Yes I too, have seen many shooting stars, heat lighting and the Northern Light.  But this was totally different.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I would have to guess that what I saw lasted for only a few seconds.  Like I said, they were traveling in a westerly direction, straight and unvarying.  The color bold truculent white, and I wondered why there was neither sound nor back trail.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I hope this answers a few of your questions and if I can be of additional assistance, please don&#39;t hesitate to ask.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((name and e-address deleted))<n>
4/27/02 23:40|Portland|OR|Circle|4 minutes|Crescent of lights, may have been edge of large craft.|5/14/02|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/022/S22664.html|12|ndxe200204| Crescent of lights, may have been edge of large craft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At about 11:40 PDT tonight I was in the bathroom, just had a little night light on, and I happened to look over the top of the curtains at the night sky. To my surprise I saw some odd looking lights moving from more or less Northwest to Southeast. I opened the window to get a better look and was astounded! It&#39;s confusing to me because I&#39;m still not exactly sure if I was looking at a single craft of multiple craft. What I saw was several blue white lights evenly spaced in a crescent shape, and an odd fuzzy looking larger light or multiple lights. That was odd as well. I was facing West at the time and the larger light may have been some kind of light in the center of a circular craft. It was a different color than the other lights, and was a little farther to the West, and may have been at the center of a craft. At first I thought I was looking at about 20 craft, but now I think it may have been one very large craft. I grabbed my binocs and ran out to the front yard to try to get a better look, but was having trouble getting the binoculars focused, and there is a kind of haze in the sky tonight, so I didn&#39;t get to view it long. I could see it south of here, but it faded into the night sky rather quickly. This thing was making no sound at all. I can hear jets and smaller craft very well when they are headed into the airport at PDX, which is only about a mile or so from here &#34;as the crow flies&#34;. I think the lights in the crescent may have been on the edge of one single craft. It was low in the sky, and if you held your arm out and hands about a foot apart that would be about the distance from the first light to the last. They didn&#39;t seem to be much brighter than an average star. I don&#39;t know what else to tell you about this one. I&#39;m the only one home tonight so, I have no other witnesses. I would like to know of any others who saw this thing tonight.<n>
4/27/02 21:58|Jacksonville|FL|Circle|4 seconds|I observed an object with a peculiar flight path and unusual lighting characteristics.|5/14/02|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/022/S22695.html|13|ndxe200204| I observed an object with a peculiar flight path and unusual lighting characteristics.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I went outside to investigate whether some rumblings I was hearing was a storm approaching or just a military exercise off in the distance. It was just a military exercise as the sky was quite clear. As I was looking around in the sky for signs of any approaching storm I noticed a bright light that moved at a fairly quick pace (I would estimate the speed of the object to be a little faster than a fighter jet). At first I thought that this was an airplane approaching me directly as the intensity of the light would have been about right. But I quickly ruled this out as the object moved along a perfectly vertical path. I would estimate the object to have been somewhere in the range (+/- a couple miles) of 5 miles from my position. The object rose rapidly in altitude and then came to an abrupt stop. The distance it traversed was about just over a foot (estimating 15 inches) in about 1 second. The light then disappeared for about 1/2 second. When the light came back on the object was about 4 inches above where I last spotted it. The object then remained stationary for 1 to 2 seconds. At this point the intensity of the light was about the same as when I first noticed it. The light then began to change. It started dimming until it again disappeared. As the light dimmed it seemed that the object became smaller but this could have been due to the reduction in the intensity of the light. The light then reappeared (the object still had not moved) with the same intensity as it had at the begining and the dimming sequence was repeated except at a much quicker pace. I called my wife outside and continued to look for the object to reappear. After observing for about 5 minutes and seeing nothing unusual we went back inside.<n>

It was cigar shaped and not as high as a plane would fly.  It was not quite dark outside...and I could see a slow moving light moving across the sky.  What seemed to draw my attention to it...was the fact that it was moving so slowly.  Just as I was about to open my mouth and tell my family to look!!

It was a light grey and moving slowly (gliding) across the sky. It slowly moved about the length of a football field (I&#39;m not good at guessing aerial distance) into some clouds and out of sight. The object could be seen for about 20 seconds. This occurred during a warm sunny day with some clouds and haze. The shape and it&#39;s movement could be seen very clearly as we approved the causeway connecting Galveston island to the mainland. There had been an airshow during the day, however this craft did not have visible wings nor did it appear to be a vintage aircraft like those in the airshow. I could not see any lights or markings of any kind.<n>

The one guy had property up there where we could go dirtbike riding. We were done riding for the day. 2 of the guys were inside cleaning off, my friend was loading up the pickup truck with the bikes and equipment. I was cleaning the surrounding yard where we had a bonfire the night previous.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Weather Conditions: Clear/Sunny, Temp 56 degrees, Wind 8-10 mph out of the NW, Unusually clear day, as was the night before, No clouds, no Chemtrails.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Sighting: The time was about 12:50 pm when this sighting occurred. I was looking up at the sky, at a passing jet plane. Normal contrail formation that rapidly disapated. Jet looked to be at about 10,000 feet up or about the size of a dime at arms length? As I was looking at the jet, I noticed some white flower petals, or something similar floating through the sky about 50-100 feet up, so that my field of focus switched to that for a moment. Thought nothing of it until I noticed one white object sitting in the sky. Object was at 85 degrees above me, (90 being directly overhead). Sun would have been at 80 degrees towards my back or 15 degrees from this objects position. This object remained stationary and looked to be spherical in shape. Color white, size undetermined, however this is where I got lucky and determined that this was in fact a ufo. Another jet passed over the same flight path of the last and crossed over this object. Now I was able to determine that this thing was below the plane. By how much, I do not know. The object remained stationary for 1 minute, then moved quickly about 2 feet over to the left. 2 feet relative to where I was staring if you were to point your finger on the object. The distance up there could be a few hundred to a thousand feet then? I continued to stare at this thing, it began to circle, in a spiral pattern, which made me think, &#34;Is this perhaps a local weather ballon caught in a wind pattern?&#34; Then it began to glide back to the right to it&#39;s original position, and ZOOM - it took off to the west, GONE! I have had other UFO sightings in the past, and to place this one as well, UFO simply put (Unidentified, Flying, Object). This could have been many things, I am only relaying what I saw. It was not ordinary. I look at the skies ALOT and have waited years to see such a thing. I was not expecting this at all, that is why I am reporting it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thank you.

They were moving westwards and as they passed over us headed northwesterly until we lost sight over some trees.The sighting lasted a couple of minutes at the most. As they flew they stayed at a level height but moved towards and away from each other in a way not unlike fish swimming. They seemed low, maybe as high as two telephone poles. They did not make a sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  One of three reports from same witness.  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

A bright star was moving from the North to the South direction. The sky was covered by clouds. The clouds were 8000-9000ft up. There were some brakes in the clouds. Watching the object at first I thougt it was a ballon but it seemed to moving to the left. I noticed it had a white flame. At this point I got my video digitel camera out and started filming. Than it moved to the right leaning to the right, still with a white flame coming out of it. I was able to film it clearly. It seemed to move at 30mph. At this point it started to move eastaly and then a ball of light apeared above the main flame. And passed throu the main flame to the bottom and as it left the main object-what I was looking at-it seemed to desapiered. It happend 4 times. And than semmed to flick out. At this point I thought it gone. I started to walk to my colliges who said they saw the same thing. As I was talking to them the light came back on in the distence. I still had the camera running so I zoomed in to the point of where the light was. I could see this was the same object, the light blinck off again and blinck on in the different place of the sky. I was able to film this with buildings and peaple in the wiev and whatever it was it was having problems flying.<n>

I had been out in the yard with nothing seen but the usual commerical/private traffic. At around 21:45 I got in my car and proceeded to take a ride. Went south down co. rd. 47 (Rabun Rd.)and turned right onto co. rd. 96 traveling west. At the end of co. rd. 96 I took a left on hwy 59 and proceeded south several miles to co. rd. 94 (may tower rd.)where I turned left. Now I&#39;m heading back east torward county rd 47. After traveling a short distance down 94 i noticed a car back behind me and thought to myself &#34;thats all i need , a car riding my butt&#34; . About 2 miles down 94 there is a curve to the right. As I rounded the curve there the damn thing was.....just sitting there...right in front of me ....in a hover. A triangluar craft about 200 ft are less off the ground and about 500 feet from my position. It had a white light in the bottom at each apex and no strobes could be seen. I was traveling at a slow speed (aprox 35 to 40 mph) and at this time the car behind me had caught up (about 200 yds max behind me). About 200 yds up on the left is a drive which leads to a friends house so pulled into the drive and stopped to allow the car behind to go by. Durning this i&#39;m still looking at this craft sitting in a hover. AS the car behind me passes by i backed out into the road. The front of my car is now facing the object ( now I&#39;m facing west again). This quick turn around must have alerted the craft to the fact that I had seen it because at this point it starts moving off to the SW. I gave chase hoping it would stop again but it proceeded to gain speed until it was out of sight. The craft clearly was triangular in shape and made no noise. I will send a detailed map via e-mail shortly. Also as stated above I turned around in a drive which leads to a friends house. This thing had to pass right over his house prior to me seeing it. I will call him this afternoon whe! n he get s in from work to see if he may have seen it. Also at this time let me state when turning around in the drive i noticed a car coming down the drive as coming from my friends house. But at this point I was giving chase so did not stay to see who it was. I would estimate the craft to be 50 to 70 ft from point to point. The color appeared to be black.<n>

There are 2 instances that night while shooting a local commercial spot (I&#39;m not sure of the exact date by the way.)  One video clip shows a very small cigar shaped object similar to one I&#39;ve seen in other video clips. It is maybe one inch long or so and pops into the frame at what seems to be around 60 in/sec (2 or so in into the frame if measured from the bottom, may have come from the top.)  Unfortunately this sighting is only one frame long (1/30 sec.) as it is the last frame of the shot.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The second one is a little bit more valid.  As I was going frame by frame in another clip to find where I wanted to cut it I found one frame with what seemed at first to be a pair of headlights in a window reflection until it dawned on me that it was only one frame of video.  There were two very small round objects about 1/2 - 3/4 in apart apparently white in color.  What I found strange was that 1 sec 8 frames later the same two round objects, the same distance apart flashed again only for one frame about 6 inches or so away and once again 1 sec. 7 frames later about another 6 inches, traveling left to right across the screen before disappearing into the lights.  there are a total of three one frame (1/30 sec) flashes with a definite trajectory all equal in time and distance apart. The objects also stay the same ditance apart from each other. The rate of travel is not very fast (less than 1 foot/sec)so my guess is that these are very small spheres of light emitted from something even smaller than they are.  These spheres are too small to show any kind of detail even with a pro quality camera.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We will invite the witness to submit still images to NUFORC, and we will attempt to identify them.

I thoughtthat I had located one of the planets but after watching for a few seconds,the light appearedto be moving. I thought that maybe my eyes were not focusing so I stopped watching and tried to refocus.  The movement was quick and seemed to be wavering and moving in an upward/downward(occasionallateral movement) pattern--watching this movement made me feel a little dizzy.  The light was definitely not a planet or star.I thought about an airplane or the medical helicopter but this light did not move in the same pattern as a plane.  The light seeemed to stay in the same general area and the movement was quick and erratic.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I went to get my husband and he also saw it briefly. It seemed to fade(into a yellowish color) and was gone. I have no idea what it was that I saw but it sure made me curious.<n>
4/24/02 23:30|Port Orchard|WA|Light|2 hours|Constantly recurring Light (over years) that changes direction too fast to be anyhting known.|5/14/02|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/022/S22641.html|29|ndxe200204| ((NUFORC Note:  We suspect the witnesses are seeing something other than UFO&#39;s.  They may be landing lights on aircraft, or perhaps celestial bodies.  PD))<n> <n><n> <n><n> Constantly recurring Light (over years) that changes direction too fast to be anyhting known.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is a recurring sight.  Nights vary, but over the past few years (first seen by myself Spring 1999) in the eastern sky, a very, very bright light frequently appears.  This light regardless of the season will always show up in the same general area of the sky.  It will go from being stationary to moving in figure eights, to north&amp; south in the sky changing direction too fast to be anything I know of.  It will some times swing like a toy tied to a pole down left then down up, reversing direction and then doing so to the right.  Some nights it will stay out for hours (like tonight) some nights for minutes after being observed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Tonight, my friend and I were out enjoying a cigarette out side and I told him about the sightings and its general reliability.  Not believing me, we walked out into the street where it can be seen through the trees and it happened to be there.  Tonight we saw more movement on it than I have ever seen before.  We watched it for about an hour and it eventually worked itself so low on the horizon we had to go to another location to see it.  At about 00:15 on 04/25/02 we made it to South Kitsap School district #402&#39;s John Sedgwick Jr. High school and observed it from the football field.  It continued its bizarre movements, sometimes none, sometimes very violent and distant (about 4-6 inches in less than 2 seconds).  It worked its way down the sky (we marked our original position with Pepsi cans) and continued to walk backwards until it was too low to be seen over the hill.  I have fixed various telescopes and binoculars on it when it seems to be stationary and nothing signifigant can be made out about it.  It just becomes a larger bright light in the sky.  I know it cannot be a planet because its always is in the same general place in the sky no matter the season, it is too bright, and it moves so visibly.  Tonight it was only myself and my friend who viewed it, but my father and another friend of mine have all seen it over the years.  Just randomly assuming this object is only 150 miles away (and it has to be further because of the attempts to view it through magnification yields nothing) its movement variation is so radical, I know that nothing known can reverse direction, turn, or even move that fast.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Time of day seems to vary, but it is always seen at night.  Every attempt to record the effect causes it to seemingly freeze (many attempts have been made by my father and myself).<n>

I looked to see what they were staring at and saw this red light floating.  The light moved unlike anything Ive ever seen before, but some what like this one magnetic toy I had as a kid; hoovering on the magnetic field.  The light swayed back and forth slowly while ascending into the sky from the South West towards the West untill it reached the thick cloud line and faded away and disappeared.  It lasted somewhere between five to ten minutes.  Where&#39;s a telescope when you need one.<n>

My brother &amp; I were observing what we thought to be a helicopter coming in from the East.  As it got closer, my brother asked me if that was a helicopter.  I looked back at it, &amp; at first I said yes, just then it changed shape into a triagular shape, I made the comment &#34;Is that the Stealth&#34;, I had heard that the Stealth had flown over Spokane 2 days prior to that.  Then I commented that it couldn&#39;t be the stealth because it was moving far to slow.  At that time it turned back into a sperical shape.  It had moved closer to us.  It was approximately between 40 to 50 degrees in relation to the Earth.  We then observed that there was some kind of a sail on top of it.  The sail would go clockwise for awhile then it would go counter clockwise, it kept doing that.  At the same time, it seemed to be wobbling.  We got the impression that it was having some kind of mechanical problems.  It would also every once in awhile shrink into a smaller sphere, then expand again a few seconds later.  The object was Jet black and had a white aura around it.  Twice that I seen lights blinked on in a circular motion around the object.  One time a beam of light shot straight out from it across the sky.  It made the sound of heavy machinery far off.  We all also felt a vibration from it.  It is strange but the vibration seemed to be very calming.  After the first 5 minutes or so of observing it, I noticed The CNA Wendy at the door.  I called her out to see it.  She came out, &amp; she looked for a while, then ran back inside and grabbed several other CNA&#39;s &amp; Nurses to come out &amp; look.  There was approximately 14 of us outside at that time.  They all heard and felt it just the same way as we did.  We discussed all the possiblites of what it could be, &amp; there was no explanation other than UFO that fit.  The object was moving very slowing, from East to West.  When it was almost directly ! overhead it started moving straight up in the sky until it was just a little pin point.  One of the CNA&#39;s (she did not observe) was so interested in our siting that she has been checking into it ever since.  She found out that on the 3rd floor of the hospital several patients, nurses, &amp; even 1 doctor had observed the UFO also.  She is in the process of trying to contact all the witnesses to have them come to this site or call the hotline &amp; report it (she gave me the phone number of where to call)<n>

I saw the light again! This time my boyfriend and I were driving up his street when I spotted the light to the north. I have been carrying my spotting scope with me ever since the last incident on April 1st. So I got the scope out and viewed the light through it. I am not sure if it was because I could not keep the scope very steady, but it looked like the craft was almost.... well, plasma. It dropped a red &#34;flare&#34; thing just like the last time, but then it dropped some other stuff that was really bright. This time the stuff that it was dropping didn&#39;t burn out- it was actually dropping to the ground! Now, the next thing that happened REALLY freaked me out! As I was staring at the light, a second light came from the ground!!!  It floated vertically, and when it got as high as the first light, the first light faded to a dot. Then the second light droppped some bright things, too. But it droppped like 5 things  one after another. All of the stuff it dropped looked like it landed on the ground near some houses!!! (In Lake Havasu City, there are lots of hills and most of the streets are on hills, so if you are on top of a street that is on a good hill,  you can see across to other neighborhoods.)  The first light started to float over to the north more, and went behind the mountains. A few seconds later, the second light did the same thing.  We drove over to where it looked the craft had dropped the things, but didn&#39;t find anything. Now I am going to make my boyfriend carry his video camera everywhere we go. Hopefully I will be able to get it on tape this time and send it to you!<n>

The craft was traveling from the west over the hwy towards the east at about three hundred feet in altitude. It then decended to approx. two hundred feet and made a ninety degree turn to the south.When it made this turn it did so abruptly yet only apeared to roll about three degrees from the horisontal while doing so. The craft had a width that I estimate at 70ft it was traveling at aprox. 150 kts. And was in view for about 1.5 minutes. In addition the whole unerside was lit up with lights. There also apeared to be two dim lights that resemble anti collision lights seen on military aircraft. Even tho I had the window down I could hear no sound above the road noise.<n>

After flashing the primary object with a flashlite, a object from the south west chased me.|4/25/02|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/022/S22635.html|38|ndxe200204| UFO&#39;s spotted for three hours. After flashing the primary object with a flashlite, a object from the south west chased me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At about 10 pm I took our dogs outside . I live on 35 wooded acres, and it is very dark, and farily remote. Walking around the rear side of the house I spotted a craft preforming manuvers that are not possible by any known craft of human design. It was really buzzing around back and fourth, up and down round and round. I watched for about 15 minutes when I ran in and got my wife when I was sure it wasnt going to leave. It was at this time I spotted two additional craft,one north and one southof us. The primary craft was west of me,exactly one mile west of M-52 is where I live and then it was west of that. These two other craft were so far from me I could only tell they were moving, thats all. After a few minutes my wife went in, she&#39;s not really interested in UFO&#39;s. I had a large flashlight with me as I always go out at night and play fetch with the dogs,they can see; I cant. I took the dogs for a long walk down the road on our property, making sure I left the light off. I did not want to attract any attention to myself away from the house, where I would be a sitting duck if this thing moved closer to investigate the light source. I played with the dogs for about two hours by the next door house light, then returned to the house where I felt very secure and brave. I was 100 yards from our house on top of a small inclined dirt driveway when I let loose with the light in a series of three bursts at regular intervals. After about five minutes of no responce I put the light on the craft of unknown distance for a few moments. This was done for about a minute each time. I did this on three seperate occasions only a few seconds apart. From out of nowhere a bright shimmering lumonious object the size of a house came screaming from my south west on an intersept course,just above the tree tops.My God the size and speed of this thing; I was in total shock!!! I have heard of this happening to other people and thank God I was ready to respond. I was very ready to respond,in fact! I couldnt believe this was happenin! g to me, it was like I was watching a movie. I kept thinking, I will die of a heart attack if this thing catches me. I ran as fast  as I could with both dogs in hot pursute; after I screamed run!!! Thank God in heaven I beat both dogs to the house, scrambling to the saftey inside.I dare say, that would be a record 100 yrd dash;bar none! Hours later I went out by the door I went in , and sure enough at least two of these craft were still malingering. I did this until sun up, no way could I sleep. Ive never been so scared in my whole life, and I am 48 yrs old. To make a long story short If you ever see a craft be damn careful if you try to shine a light on it in hope of a responce. You may just get much more than you bargined for. I did try to call the St.Charles police when the objects were first spotted. They didnt answer, we have a very small town. I told my dad about what happened, former Saginaw Chief of Police Wesley F.Alcorn; he said I should have tried the sherifs office. This never crossed my mind until he mentioned it. This is not the first UFO experience I have had out here, I cant count on both hands and toes how many craft Ive seen out here. This is however the most frightning and serious. I have no doubt whatsoever they would have captured me,were they able! Needless to say I wont provoke another UFO responce ever again, this has been enough to last a life time!!! Isn&#39;t there a radar around here that should be picking these things up? Why isnt anyone elce seeing these objects? Does anyone elce in this area have any similar experiences? I cant bee the only night owl. I also cant believe I have been the only one too see these craft.I have been seeing similar craft for at least two years now, but none like this one! I have never reporded a sighting to anyone,until now. These guys are real slick, they dont come at you with the craft your signaling, but send out one your not aware of or cant see to try and capture you. Thank God I knew this and was ready, expecting a encounter from my right or left side. ! It came from my left side. I just hope they dont come back and catch me with my pants down again!<n>

I though I heard faint whispers somewhere in my room.  Suddenly, a light in the middle of my room glimmered, grew, and shone brightly for a few minutes, then faded with a sigh-like sort of sound.  I then felt a sort of tingle across my face, neck, and down my arm, then my hand began to throb.  It tingled and pulsed, and began to glow a deep dark bluish-green.  Then a flash of light, and I felt like I was being lifted into the air, and dropped back onto my bed.  I am sure that I was awake, and I wasn&#39;t hurt at all.<n>

4/22/02 21:30|Primm Springs|TN|Light|2-3 seconds|Myself and two witnesses observed a light, not a meteor, moving at low altitude across the sky; its duration was no more than three sec|4/25/02|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/022/S22625.html|44|ndxe200204| Myself and two witnesses observed a light, not a meteor, moving at low altitude across the sky; its duration was no more than three sec<n> <n><n> <n><n> My wife, a friend and myself were looking in the western sky trying to observe the planetary alignment.  Having missed going outside shortly after sunset we were pontificating which of the bright stars could possibly be planets.  There came a bright light coming from the south and moving at a very, very fast pace towards the southwest.  We only observed the light for about two to three long seconds.  It could very well have been a meteorite but we all agree that there was enough evidence to discredit it being a meteorite.  If it were a meteorite there would be so many coincidences, making this one of the most abstract, obscure, and simply rare metorites ever documented.  In fact the only evidence that could sunstantiate it being a meteorite are the facts that it had a very short duration, and moved at a rapid speed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The light came from behind us.  It seemed to come from nowhere the way that is common with meteorites.  I should add here that to the south,not even seconds before we observed the light, we were commenting on the number of aircraft were in the area.  There were anywhere between five and ten aircarft flying around directly south of us, again the same direction the light came from.  At least three of these aircraft seemed to be flying in almost a triangular formation as if looking for something.  It was only seconds after we made the comment about the aircraft that we observed the light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We are all in agreeance to the following characteristics that we feel differentiate this light from a typical meteorite.  Again, this could all be a rare string of coincidences.  I feel at some point you have too many coinidences and have to look in other areas: 1.  The light had no visible tail as is indicative to most meteors.  It seemed to be a simple ball of light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 2.  The light never faded or quivered in its brightness and intensity.  The light remained the same constant brightness.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 3.  The light just disspeared.  One moment it was there, the next it was gone.  This is important because most meteors seem dissapate.  They seem to start bright and slowly fizzle out to nothingness, or at least grow dimmer.  This one just plain vanished, there was no dissapation, it gave no indication to going out, it just vanished.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 4.  The light seemed to remain parallel to the horizon, it gave no indication to have downward momentum...it was moving horizontally.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 5.  The light seemed to be lower than the aircraft.  It was at least in the troposhere or the stratusphere.  To think that this light was in the ionosphere would have to make it incredibly large.  Also at the rapid speed that it was moving would have made it close to, if not breaking the sound barrier.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 6.  Again, the local aircraft seemed to be flying in formation as if looking for something.  This is the same direction that the light was travelling from.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 7.  Again noting the size of the light.  Although meteors come in all sizes, this one seemed incredibly large.  If you could imagine a ligt about the size of the tip of your thumb moving across the sky, that would be about the size.  Again, this could be another indication as to how low the light was.  The light was larger than the lights of the aircraft, and to be 30 miles high would make this a massive object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ....The general consensus of our group was that this was not a meteorite.  Was it a craft?  Maybe.  But there are just too many characteristics that could not lead us to believe that it was a meteor.  Whatever this object was, seemed to be trying to get away from something.<n>

The lights were moving  northeast  at a slow pace . first there were two lights  hovering around each other about 500 ft apart.They would move in close to each other and rotate in circles slowly.They did not make noise .The lights flashed and pulsed . It also had flashing colors on the sides.I could see the silohouete of the crafts. they were square in shape.As I rode down the interstate I was trying to register what  was seeing. As i came to Cypress Springs exit, the radio station i was listening to reported strange lights in Pasadena  and Galveston on 288 . They seemed pretty excited about it. I pulled over at a gas station off the exit and noticed other people looking up at the lights. I got off and was talking to some observers when three more lights started coming across the sky heading the same direction as the others . They were about 3 to 4 hundred yards from each other moving at the exact same speed. They wouuld seem to form  a sporadic formation. As I drove to my destination i noticed two more lights heading the same directions. They did the same thing just hovered near each other and moved slowly towards the others. They were the last lights that i saw that night.  all i can say is that i&#39;m not the only on that saw these lights, and i would like for next time to be able to share this experience with my family and friends.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

I stepped outside to light a cigarette. I looked up because I usually do as I have witnessed sights in the past many years ago and it is just habit now. Just as I looked directly up, facing the southeast, I noticed a white, star-like object appear out of nowhere. It glowed unlike a star and then went out. I continued to stare at that area in the sky and the light appeared again. It stayed like that a few seconds, went out again and came on again about 3 seconds later. To my absolute amazement, it began to move north slowly. It moved approximately the width of a face of a quarter, at arms length. Then all of a sudden it took off at the most incredible speed I&#39;ve ever seen! It left a hazy bluish, white trail for an instant and disappeared. This was the second sighting I saw that week. On April 18th at around 9:30 P.M. I saw a stationery red light from the same spot I witnessed the previos sighting. However I was facing due West. The light appeared out of nowhere, went out for about 10 seconds, appeared again and went out. This was not a plane because this light did not move. I reported it to MUFON a few days later only to find out that there were 2 other witnesses to a day time sighting in that same location. The witnesses were pilots on the ground. It hovered over the police station. Needless to say this has freaked me out quite a bit. Had I been a couple of seconds earlier or later I would not have seen these UFO&#39;s.<n>

What&#39;s that!&#34;  I noticed he was looking up into the sky.  I looked up also and saw approximately seven points of light moving from south to north.  We were facing toward the east.  The points of light, as I call them, were red in color and did not blink.  Although clearly visible, they did appear to be quite distant.  As compared to a satellite visible at night, these lights (as a whole group) moved somewhat faster and were easier to see (brighter although not as bright as airplane lights).  These points of light were moving together as a group, however the distance between each one was constantly changing.  There was no set formation.  One light would move forward, another would move back.  One would move from one side and another to the other side.  They did not move one at a time either.  Two or three would be displaying this characteristic at the same time.  I was not able to determine any rhythmic pattern to their movement.  Generally, they were all travelling to the north, however each seemed to have a &#34;mind of it&#39;s own&#34; by switching places with another.  This continued for approximatley 15 seconds until we lost sight them.  Weather conditions were not a factor as it was a clear night.<n>

We were sitting down overlooking a large field, when i got a strange feeling and turned around. Just around the corner of a hill, about 1/2 a mile off, i was a large bright orange object. I told my friend to look, and he did. We saw it for less than 5 seconds, and the light just faded out and disappeared. There was no noise. About 20 minutes later, we were sitting in a different place, and were looking over another field, about 200 yards from where the first sighting appeared. Suddenly, a large bright orange object just appeared in the sky above us. It seemed to have a total of 5 lights, 3 in a trianuglar shape on the bottom, and possibly 2 on top. It was there for about 5 seconds, and then just disappeared. I believe it was the same craft as before, and it seemed to be watching us.<n>

At 11:00 am I was on the roof of my house fixing a roof leak. I have a beautiful view of mountains in the background. I turned to look up into the clear blue sky towards the west, (I automatically look up into the sky everyday and night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first, I just enjoyed the view of the mountains but something caught my eye. A small glimmer in the sky. I thought it might be a star still visible but then I realized it just couldn´t be. I went for my binoculars and when I got back, the glimmer had gotten remarkably larger. When I looked at it with the binoculars I clearly saw that it was a gigantic metallic object with oval shape that was hovering. I am used to looking around the ufo´s that I see because usually there are more. As I searched around the object, I didn´t see anything at first, but then I focused a little better and saw several smaller discs surrounding the large one. I yelled to my sister and she joined me and saw the same thing. I continued to search the larger objects perimeter and I was astounded to see smaller discs flying in closer to the larger object which I will now refer to as the mothership. We counted at least 50 small discs surrounding the mothership. I was in total disbelief at what followed. During the next 45 minutes, we witnessed how the smaller discs entered the mothership, one by one until they were all inside! Then the mothership started to move slowly towards the south. I looked around again and spotted a second mothership coming into the picture, and they both took off so fast that I could not follow them. It was something that has had a profound effect on me and my sister, but the story doesn´t end there. What follows is also unbelievable. I spent the rest of the day in the hot sun on that roof waiting to see if they came back. I ended up with a severe sunburn. Later on, a friend of mine and his girlfriend showed up. I told them what had happened and of course they just laughed at me, but I wasn´t coming down from that roof. They decided to join me and my friend, looking through the binoculars towards the mountains all of the sudden spotted something. As we turned to look I saw that it was a large aircraft. No large aircraft fly in this area. The more we looked, the stranger the aircraft seemed to be. At a dista! nce it a lmost looked like the 747 that carries the space shuttle on it´s back. As it got closer in our view and became sideways to our view, I realized it was an AWAC plane! Mexico has no AWAC´s. It had to be from the U.S.! My friends were just as astonished as I was and now they started to believe my story. What was an american AWAC plane doing in Cuernavaca, Mexico? Then, two other things happened. It just kept getting better and better. Two military jets flew right over our heads! They were so fast and so loud that I couldn´t identify them but I could swear that they were two american F-16´s. Either way, Mexico does not have that type of aircraft. I know that this story sounds completely like it was from a patient out of an insane assylum, but I swear it is true. About ten minutes later (dusk) my friends became total believers when we saw a light coming over the mountains. It´s flight patterns were erratic and changed quickly. Not an airplane. As it got closer we could see it through the binoculars. It was a huge sphere, deep bright orange, I don´t know if it was the reflection from the sunset but that´s what it looked like. It seemed to be landing towards the east. I got on the phone and called a friend in the small town of Tepoztlan and told her about it, that it was coming her way. While on the phone, she described it to me as it landed somewhere over the mountaintop. So now we all knew we weren´t seeing things. Needless to say, we spent most of the night on that roof, without any further sightings. The next day, I got a call from another friend who related to me, that he had seen what looked like two F-16´s flying over northern Cuernavaca! Then I told him my story. We all got together that weekend to share our experience. No one else that we´ve told about this believes us, so, since then we have just kept it to ourselves, but one thing for sure, no matter what we have seen out there through the years, now I know for a FACT, that they truly do EXIST and they are HERE!!! I have heard of motherships before, ! but now I´ve seen them with my own eyes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

Im in law enforcment and this is kinda odd. Any way i was outside just looking up taking a break cause i heard that on this night was sopposed to be some kinda planetary alignment well i looked straight up and saw two bright lights i assumed where plants. After about a minute i thought i was getting dizzy because they appeared to be moving like rotating one around the other so i looked down to make sure i wasnt seeing things. When i looked back up the one light moved away from the other slowly and it slowly got faint till it dissapeared like it was rising. The thing that is weird is there was no flashing lights no colors just a constant white light. sorry to bother you just figured i would tell someone i feel kinda odd. Thanks for being here.<n>

Appeared outside of window in middle of night and I thought it was a full moon that bathed the surrounding area in light. Next morning, I checked the calendar and there is no full moon until the 27th (April). (When I looked again, could have been an hour later, the sky was completely black, a cloudy, dark night.)<n>

Male age 52, son age 18, female age 50. All three of us wrote down our observations independently and they are almost completely identical. Object was observed almost directly overhead, moving roughly northwest. It was a triangular shape, with softly glowing orange tips on all three points. The outline appeared to be faintly lit as well. I would guess its&#39; altitude to have been at least several thousand feet. It moved steadily in a straight line until it was blocked by the roof of the house. There was absolutely no sound we could discern.<n>

At the top of my peripheral vision, I saw movement.  When I looked up, I noticed some of the stars in the night sky were winking out of existence, as if blocked by something overhead.  My view was initially obscured by a parking lot lamp, so I jogged down the isle a little way, to get a better view.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What I observed was a massive, triangular shaped object floating silently over the mountain, moving slowly towards the Northwest.  The object had no visible lights and I could only (initially) discern its shape by the stars that it blocked, which came back into existence as the object passed by.  There were a couple of quiet vehicles traveling in the area, but I could clearly discern absolutely no sound coming from the sky.  There was a slight breeze (can&#39;t remember the direction), but nothing strong or abnormal.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As my eyes adjusted to the light, I began to see a dim reflection of the light from the parking lot, indicating the object was approximately 300 to 500 feet above (just high enough to clear the nearby hill it was floating over).  I thought I could see some features of the object, but the reflected light was far too dim to be certain of any detail.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Using the estimated height, the casino and the hill as guides, I estimated the visible surface area to be approximately 36,450 square feet (about 100 yards to a side).  Bigger than any aircraft I had ever seen, except in science fiction.  Gauging by the disappearance and re-appearance of the stars, I figured it was traveling at approximately 50-75 miles per hour, much too slow to be lift-driven, like tradiitonal aircraft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I watched, the object changed direction, moving to the West and flew slowly over the hill and out of sight, revealing all of the stars it had previously blocked.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After the object left my sight, a guest (Caucasian, mid-forties, clean-shaven with light-brown hair) drove up to me in his sedan and exclaimed, &amp;quot;What the hell was that?!&amp;quot; I replied, &amp;quot;I don&#39;t know what you mean, sir,&amp;quot; because I did not know if he was talking about the same object I saw, and I did not want one of ours guests to think I was a nut-job.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The man then said, &amp;quot;That &#34;thing&#34; in the sky!   What the hell was it? !&amp;quot; I replied, &amp;quot;I don&#39;t know, sir.  I&#39;ve never seen anything like it.&amp;quot;  The man then said, &amp;quot;Did you hear it make any sound?  I didn&#39;t hear anything.&amp;quot; I told the man I did not hear any sound either.  He then drove away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I spoke with several co-workers, but none of them saw the object, neither did they hear anything overhead.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date is approximate.

The craft was spotted in the evening sky remaining motionless. It appeared to be stationary over a field some six blocks distant. Looking from the side, it had a flat bottom and top- but was egg-shaped in outline.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was built in three sandwiched layers: Top &#34;deck&#34;: Dark. Had a shiny band bisecting the craft just behind amidship (assuming the egg&#39;s pointed end to be a bow.) The width of this band was roughly one-fourth the length of the craft. The shiny band reflected moonlight quite well.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Middle &#34;deck&#34;: Single row of narrowly-spaced oval lights arranged Red/Blue/Green all around the circumference of the object.

Then right behind it came another light and then another. I went out onto our back deck and these three lights slowly (it seemed) glided silently and circled back over the trees. After a few minutes, they came over the trees again and two arched to the left and one to the right until they were out of my range of vision. I ran upstairs to get my sons&#39;s binoculars and went back out. Again two white lights this time came over the trees and throught the binoculars I could make out blue and red lights on either side of the white light (which was in the middle). Again they went over my house and out of my view. This Friday we had sudden and violent storm activity and as it darkened, there was periodic clouds and clearing. After the 3rd time, there were two-three more sightings-always in sets of two or three. Because it was dark, I could not make out the shape, but could through the binoculars see the blinking of the blue and red lights on either side of the white light. During this span of time, I called the State Trooper barracks in Wurtsboro to find out who I could report this to and they gave me the # for the FAA in Newburgh-I tried several times but it was always busy; I also called our friends the next road over from us being the lights went in that direction and asked her to go out and look; I grabbed my Kodak &#34;throw-away: camera and took as many pictures as was left on it but haven&#39;t had it developed yet. Unfortunately, my husband was at a meeting that night and didn&#39;t get home until 10:30pm. At some point during the night or early am, I awoke because the house and my bed was vibrating. It felt like a tremor and stopped shortly after and I fell back to sleep. The next day (Saturday), my friend called to say she didn&#39;t see anything when she went outside the night before but there was an earthquake further upstate. The newspaper reported a 5.2 quake in Jay, NY, and that two years ago on th! e same d ay in the same place (Jay, NY) there had been an earthquake of approximately the same magnitude. I do not believe this was a coincidence. In last Monday&#39;s newspaper there was an article that a man in Pine Bush (the next town over from me) videotaped a &#34;ufo&#34; he saw &#34;early in April&#34; (the paper did not give the exact date). Amazingly, when I shared this information with my family members, friends, and co-workers I was surprised how many believe that there is intelligence &#34;out there&#34;. To say the least, I am astounded by all this and every night since my sightings I go out on my deck several times to look up into the sky. Also, since that night we have had numerous fast and sometimes furious storm activity. Thank you for letting me document this episode with you.<n>

This seven light boomerang shaped formation appeared out of the southeast moving northwest; as I looked closer,  thinking it may have been a formation of jets from the Niagara Falls Air Base, one craft darkly appeared. No sound, seven white (a bit brighter than a normal magnituide star) lights like a flock of geese. It faded from view after about 15 seconds, just as it appeared. I&#39;m still upset.(Angle of elevation was about 30 degees.)<n>

This all took place as I was staring into the night sky sitting at a bus stop. Was it commercial? NO! Was it military? If it was, then I&#39;m curious why I didn&#39;t know such an aircraft even existed. And just what would the military be doing flying this secret craft so low over Santa Cruz anyway? Was it an alien aircraft? I want to say no - but to me it&#39;s kind of just unexplainable.

About 20 minutes later my friend called me outside to watch unusual lights he was observing. In the western sky 4 or 5 blinking lights were moving about in no particular order. Every once in awhile 3 or 4 very bright triangular white lights would seem to emit from the blinking light in a staggered formation.I saw this happen about three times. Then one light emitted 4 or 5 very bright balls of white light in a straight line out the back. These emitted lights lasted only for seconds, though the blinking lights were constant. I don&#39;t know what flares look like, so that is what it could have been, except for one thing...there was one light that did not blink. It moved very very rapidly diagonally and seemed to stop on a dime and change direction. Then it started to blink again and move towards another blinking light. I have no way to judge distance, but they seemed to be very high in the atmosphere. After 15 or so minutes, all the lights moved north towards Tucson (50 miles away. The unusual thing about the blinking lights was that they seemed to move in a very disorganized way. 45 minutes later, the foggy bands were still in the same place in the sky, though I don&#39;t know if the two are connected.<n>

And Landed in a near by area in some farm land! We where all trying to come to terms with what we have just seen we thought maybe it was a crop duster or maybe a copter doing it runs (Practice flying at night). We pulled over down a dirt road to see. The Shape of the object is what threw us off until we got closer and we new for sure that was no crop duster or Copter! The Air Craft had changing lights and strobes this went on for about 30 mins maybe we started to hear this really load humming sound into a loud squall We new for sure this wasnt anything we had seen before the air craft had gotten louder it started to lift up slow into the sky the lights started shinning into the sky like it was tryin to send a message 2 more air craft showed up after a few mins of the flashing lights! the formed into a pattern and took off into the nights sky!

The boy described to his parents a yellow, &#34;glowing&#34; oval shaped object slowly passing from west to east in front of his window. As the boy began to watch the object, it quickly accelerated its speed and left the area. About three seconds later, a triangular shaped object appeared in the same airspace as the oval object had seconds before, following the same path.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Update...<n> <n><n> <n><n> During the weekend of May 10th and 11th of the UFO Fest in Mcminnville, I was fortunate enough to meet this very charming and polite 9 year old boy. I sat and talked with him about his sighting and he spoke of it in a very no nonsense manner as a child this age would when recalling an event from memory. I was extremely impressed by his sincerity and feel that this boy saw exactly what he described to me as seeing. In my many years of interviewing people I have become very good at noticing the difference of how a story is presented from actual memory compared to a fabricated story told more than once. With younger people like this boy, the details searched for during the interviewing process are even more profoundly different as boys this age are much better at telling you the details of what really happened rather than repeating a scenario created in story form in their head. At one point during his testimony, I asked about the second craft and how it followed in the same path as the first oval shaped object, and he corrected me in that the second triangle shaped craft actually followed a little lower than the altitude of the first object, a detail that could have been easily left out of a made up story but came out when pressed, a good sign that the story was in fact being recalled from memory. I find this sighting of a very credible nature.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This report was previously reported to NUFORC and this is a follow up to that report.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Eric Byler - Assistant Director, Oregon UFO Research.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We express our gratitude to Eric Byler and Skip Schultz, of Oregon UFO Research, for following up on the case, and sharing the information with NUFORC.

The objects were moving far too quickly to be airplanes. I saw the first object moving by itself very quickly toward my direction and then it veered off in a northerly direction. A few minutes later I spotted two more objects of exactly the same quality and size moving very quickly but always remaining the same distance apart. I called my roommate outside so I&#39;d have at least one other witness. He and I both watched the two objects quite clearly for about 45 seconds. He went back inside when the objects disappeared behind one of the few clouds in an otherwise unusually clear night sky. The strange thing about these two objects was that they never re-appeared on the other side of the cloud as a satellite or airplane would have had to do (at their rate of speed, we figure it should have taken them no more than 10 or 15 seconds to re-appear). I later spoke with one of the local TV weathermen who had mentioned on his weathercast the next night that he had seen these same two flying objects. He told me that he and his son also had seen them disappear behind that single cloud and never emerge on the other side! These were the only two of the total seven objects I eventually saw that did not appear to emit flashing light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Finally, to my amazement, several minutes later I spotted FOUR MORE of the lights (craft?) traveling in a different part of the sky and going in a totally different direction from objects 1 and objects 2 and 3. These four &#34;flew&#34; from south to north and the four of them maintained strict relative position to each other but were not flying in a straight-line pattern. All four had regularly flashing lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is the first time in my life I&#39;ve seen anything remotely like this. The objects made no sound, had no red lights as are typically found on airplanes, and they travelled at what must have been very high speeds, though they did not &#34;dart&#34; around, nor were there any &#34;gaps&#34; in their flight patterns. Most exciting thing I&#39;ve witnessed in years. I&#39;d love to know if anyone else saw them!<n>

Not more than 2-3 mintues later a pair of lights came from the opposite direction, thinking it was probably the same jets coming back, but this time the lights were moving at least twice the height distance.  The lights were not blinking and there was no sound.  The lights moved at the same equal distance the jets were flying apart. The lights moved slowly across the sky, took a Eastern turn then disappeared.

He also was pointing to other planets telling me what they were. I got cold (actually I got bored) and went back into the house.  A few minutes later he stuck his head in the door, and said &#34;you gotta come see this!&#34; His eyes were bulging out of his head so I thought maybe I should go.  He pointed to what looked like 2 VERY bright stars.  One higher than the other. They sorta looked like other group of stars to me, so I said ya, what about them?  He said &#34;MY GOD, THEY ARE MOVING&#34;.  I took a better look and sure enough they were not moving like a plane would, but more like floating and floating very fast. They were both moving at the same pace, one was higher than the other.  They were moving from north west to south east.  It only took say 30 seconds to move from one side of the sky all the way to the other side.  Then all of the sudden the bottom one disapered, right while I was watching! Then within 2 seconds the top one just vanished.  Where they were floating it was perfectly clear skys. There were several airplanes in the area, so we could compare movement and lights.  These were very different.  The light was so intense, especially for as high as they were, Like I said when we first saw them they looked the same size and as far away as the stars.  Only these were brighter. And the way they just seemed to float or, I don&#39;t even know how to explain it exactly. It was just so different.  And they were in perfect harmony with each other. It was 2 crafts, not one with two lights. Well, it was quite a site that we will never forget.  To bad neither one of us thought to swing that telescope around and have a better look.  But really they were flying to fast for that.  Guess I&#39;ll have to go star gazing with my husband more often... I never thought it could be so exciting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  ISS and Space Shuttle passed over this area of the U. S. at 20:50 on this date.  Please see www.Heavens-above.com.  PD))<n>

As I was searching below Venus I see two bright lights, one folowing the other, approaching faster than any aircraft travels comeing from WWN part of the sky. Lowering the binoculars I can see that the folowing one is speeding up and slowing down, almost touching the leading light then backing off and repeteing this earaticly but always in a straght line behind the lead light. I then run to my next door neighbor&#39;s house and drag him out side to check it out. I look once more thru the knock&#39;s to double ckeck for clearancr lights and wings ect. Seeing none I hand the glasses to him and sprint inside my house to get my video camera(that takes me appx. 15 secs.) as I return and set down the tripod I look up to see the last light do a 90 degree turn up off the deck(without slowing down) and accelrate into space(now due south from us) just like StarTrack Next Generation going to warp. My neighbor said the first light did the same thing just before I set the tripod down. He also said he seen the lights&#34;play lienear tag with each other&#34;while I was getting the camera as I have described above.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About five minutes later we see another light in the same part of the sky that the first two lights went to warp in. This light is the same color,shape and sizw as the first two lights. This light flashes two or three times then stays lite while it looked like it skipped off the atmosphere back into space then went out.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The color of the lights were like floresent lights but a brighter more intense floresent.<n> <n><n> <n><n> No wind, clear sky, no aircraft around.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is flawed in report, but we feel confident that the witness is alluding to the planetary alignment, visible on April 17, 2002.

4/17/02 20:46|Oxnard|CA|Light|3-5 minutes|On Wednesday April 17, 2002 I had just returned home from attending a Centennial Committee meeting that had finished at Oxnard City Hal|5/14/02|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/022/S22680.html|86|ndxe200204| On Wednesday April 17, 2002 I had just returned home from attending a Centennial Committee meeting that had finished at Oxnard City Hall around 8:10 pm or so.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After arriving back at my apartment complex, and as I was walking back to my apartment at around 8:30 pm, I stopped to chat with one of the maintenance folks who was standing outside the laundry room with his girl friend.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Since it was a very clear night sky, I mentioned to them how bright the stars were, especially with all the evening fog we had been having.   As we were looking up at the moon and stars (we were facing west and looking Northwest), we noticed two very bright white objects - which at first I mistook for stars.  As we watched them though, we noticed that the bright white objects were moving from the northwest towards the south about the speed which airlines normally travel from LAX to SFO.  One was trailing the other very close - too close for conventional commercial aircraft in air corridors.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As a matter of fact, these objects were traveling in the vicinity of the air corridor for air traffic flying between LAX and SFO, with the exception that they appeared very high in the sky - higher then normal air traffic would be.  Since I have a commercial pilots license (in-active pilot), I was trying to see the red and green wing tip lights that would determine they were either private or commercial aircraft.  After watching for a minute, I could never make out the shape of the object or see any wingtip lights.  After concluding that they must be commercial aircraft, I went up to my apartment and turned on the TV.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Unfortunately, that was not the end of the story.  The next morning I saw the maintenance man who had watched the objects with me the previous evening.  He told me that had I stayed another 1 1/2 minutes and watched,  I would have seen something unexplainable for an ordinary aircraft to do.  Evidently, as the bright white objects were getting closer towards LAX, they separated with one shooting straight up and the other going up and out-of-sight at a very steep angle.  He thought that it might be a &#34;stealth&#34; aircraft but I told him that &#34;known&#34; military aircraft cannot achieve those kinds of speed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have read other reports for April 17th which seem to mirror the events we witnesed. I have also read that what we witnessed may have been the ISS and Space Shuttle passing overhead.<n>

The two dimmer set of lights then changed position criss crossing each other. I watched both sets as they disappeared into the haze of the city lights.

Here is a complete description of the sighting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I drove west of Denver on Hwy 6 at about 20:20 Mountain time on 4/17/02, I was looking at the western sky at dusk to see if I could observe an astronomical event of planets aligning (see astronomical bulletins).  As I looked up again I noticed two star-like lights traveling at what appeared to be a very high altitude and very high rate of speed (above 200 mph at least).  They had no blinking lights but were apparently luminescent.  They remained equidistant apart and were traveling in a southeast direction.  I happened to be on my phone with my wife, who was traveling on I-25 North (about 10 minutes from where I was)at the time of my sighting.  I told her about it and then pulled over to get gas and get out of my car to look at it.  I saw the lights continue Southeast so I yelled over to a man getting out of his truck and asked if he could see these objects.  He stated he could.  I asked him if he knew what they were and he stated that he did not know.  He appeared interested and then went into the convenience store.  I started pumping gas and called my wife again and asked if she could see the lights.  She responded that she could and she pulled off the highway to get a better look.  She stated that they continued on their way in a southeastern direction at a constant rate of speed and distance apart until out of sight.  My reaction during the sighting was one of calm surprise and excitement to confirm it&#39;s existence with my wife.  I was also excited that my wife would take notice of something like this at the end of the day going home from work.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  International Space Station, possibly still in formation with the Space Shuttle, passed over Lakewood, CO, from 20:16 to 20:23 hrs. on this date.

It traveled a large distance in 3-4 seconds, which is the entire duration of what I saw and traveled the distance of maybe 30 full moons. It traveled in a straight line and seemed to vanish.  I pointed it out to my wife as soon as I saw it and she saw it also and confirmed there were pulsating lights.  At first I thought it was a meteor grazing the atmosphere, but when my wife said she saw the pulsating lights I had to keep an open mind.  I definately don&#39;t know what it was, but it seemed to be a craft, not a metoer.  Any other sightings in the New England area tonight?<n>

We were about to head back inside, when I saw something.  It was what seemed to be circular or disk shaped and had yellowish/orange lights that pulsated in a circular motion around the object.  However these lights were only on the sides of the object, not the front or back (not on the sides that were in front of or behind the direction the object was travelling).  There were about four or five &#34;panels of individual light&#34; on each side and went like I said in a clockwise direction around the object, with only one panel lit at one time. The object  was about the size of two full moons when the moon is high in the sky, and travelled about the distance of 30 full moons in 3-4 seconds.  It made no sound at all and almost appeared transluscent, the lights were the only things I saw.  There were no clouds at all in the area.  As soon as I noticed it, I pointed it out to my wife, who saw it immediately due to it&#39;s size.  She confirmed the lights were pulsating.  The object seemed to vanish into thin air, I had an unobstructed view in the direction it was travelling when it disappeared.  I am also very close (within 4 miles) to a small airport and the FAA tracking center for the East Coast.<n>

I noticed the object immediately.  I was larger than an aircraft would have been and was just floating in the sky.  It was cylinder shaped with running lights on it.  They seemed to be whirring around the object.  The light were white with some blue and pink in them.  I considered I was possible seeing a plane at some strange angle, but there were several aircraft in the sky over Denver and this was very different.  The lights seemed to be larger and brighter than other aircraft lights.  The object was silent and started to move 1 direction only and that was straight down.  When I first saw it it was about 40 degrees above eye level, then it just floated straight down like it was going to land somewhere.  I lost sight of it behind some hills and trees.  The sighting lasted 1 to 2 min.<n>

It was visible through some tree branches at first, so we changed position for a clearer view (thinking it might be tree branches giving the appearance of movement). It still maintained its pattern of movement; slightly vertical and slightly horizontal, and would periodically flash blue and red. We don&#39;t believe it could not have been an airplane, since it was hovering in position; a plane would have visibly moved across the sky, rather than moving slightly in place. I went into the house and got our video recorder, and we taped the object for 10 minutes or so, zooming in as much as 32x. Through the zoom on the recorder, we could see it growing in size and then shrinking suddenly, as if it were &#34;pulsing&#34;. We taped our house and lights visible from the World Trade Zone for reference. After 10-15 minutes we went back inside. 15 minutes later I went back to look for the object and it was gone. I filed a police report around 10 PM, after checking the internet to see if it might have been a planet or other conspicuous object.<n>

I live in Eastern Kentucky about six miles outside of a small town with a population of about 3200.  The place I live at is a rural area with wooded hills surrounding the house I live in with my husband.  At approximately 1:00 a.m. on the morning of Tuesday, April 16, 2002 I walked outside onto my front porch to bring my cat inside.  It was a cool night but not cold and the sky was very clear.  The stars were bright- no clouds.  I glanced up in the sky to the left of my house which would be east and an object flashing in the distance and above the trees on the hill caught my eye.  At first I thought it was an airplane but almost immediately dismissed the idea when I noticed that it was not moving across the sky like an airplane would but rather it was sort of bouncing around a bit and moving erratically.  What also startled me was that it was flashing different colors.  At first it appeared light blue then would change to white and then green and then reddish.  It appeared round in shape and small.  I watched in shock for about two minutes as it hovered and moved around in the same spot in the sky, flashing and appearing different colors.  After I realized that it couldn&#39;t possibly be a star or an airplane or helicopter the thought occurred to me that I should call someone and get them to come over and see this.  I thought that if I was the only one to see it no one would believe me when I told them about it.  So I called my friend who lives about one and half miles away and told her what I was seeing and asked her to come over and bring her video camera.  My husband was gone at the time.  She arrived in about six or seven minutes and we stood in the yard and videotaped the object for about twenty eight minutes.  The object would just hover in one spot at times and then move around erratically all the while flashing and seeming to flash different colors.  But it stayed in the same general area to the east and above the sa! me tree line.  It appeared far away so the shape was hard to make out but upon viewing the video footage later in slow motion it appeared to be round.  During the time that we were filming my husband returned home and watched it also.  It never left our sight the entire time but watching it through the camcorder it could only be seen when it flashed white or light blue.  We were all amazed and could not figure out what it was.  When we decided we had enough footage of it my friend and I decided that we needed to get her adapter that allows playback of the videotape in a VCR that she had left at home so we left to get it and when we returned to my house it was gone.  We have watched the video footage of it over and over again and still can&#39;t figure out what we have seen.  When it is watched in slow motion the movement of the object is much more visible and unbelieveable.  It also appears to change shape and color as it zig-zags around.  We have never witnessed anything like this before.  I am a very open-minded person and have always believed other stories of sightings but I never thought I would see something like I saw.  I would love an explanation of what I saw that night.  But I know that it can&#39;t be dismissed as simply an airplane or helicopter or the like.  And I know I&#39;ll never forget what we saw as long as I live.<n>

There were, at times, anywhere from 4 to 6 lights along the mountain.  Some would fade out and others would appear. At first we thought they were headlights from cars on the highway.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was coming up on shift change at Centinela State Prison and officers that live in Alpine and San Diego would have been coming into the valley at this time.  The more we watch though the more we realized that some of the lights were actually higher than the mountains and some were closer, actually over the valley floor.  The color was generally yellowish-orange, but occasionally they were bright blue-white.  We have seen these lights out there before on a number of other occasions, but always assumed they were headlights on the highway.  After really watching them the other night, now we&#39;re not so sure.<n>

At about 8:30 P.M. on April 15, 2002, two people in a car observed a bright light low in the sky moving towards them and hovered over some nearby trees. The light was attached to an object about the size of a bus, that was described as looking like the fuselage of an airplane but was to fat or wide. It also had two wings which appeared much to small to support the larger craft. There was a red non-blinking light on each wing, and the bright white light was at the front of the object.

Could not make out color.  Low cloud cover that morning.  The craft was flying just inside the cloud.  enough to make out faint outline and lights.  There was a light on the bottom in each of the three corners.  There were also lights at about the midpoint of each side.  Those lights were at the upper and bottom part of the sides.  These lights seem to blink or pulse in a certain pattern while changing colors.  The craft was moving approx. 400 miles/hr, and there was no sound.  The craft flew about 1/8 to 1/4 of a mile to the west of my position, using the clouds for cover.  I would estimate the craft was about 200 to 300 ft above ground.  I watched it until it vanished into the clouds about .5 to 1 mile north of my position.  I noticed the craft when looking at the mountains out of my work window.  I thought it might be a reflection of a passing car or a plane landing at the jeffco airport.  I went outside to rule out reflection, and it was still there.  I ruled out plane when I noticed that it made no sound and was traveling parrelel to the airport runway&#39;s.  I also ruled out plane by the way the lights were flashing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My Background, 27yrs old, Engineering Drafter, I believe in ufo&#39;s and e.t.

I went into my pick-up and started it to warm my cold bones. There were only two other campsites in use since it was the &#39;early&#39; season. One site had a few young folks and was noisy till 11pm. When I woke the sky was cloud covered, dark, and the storms had died down but the staedy rain had not. I left my tent and went into my pick-up, started the engine to warm-up, and lit a cig. Now after my 1974 UFO incident; and all the &#34;Talk&#34; after that one this was unique. All of a sudden a stream of Universal Pictures Stars decended from the low clouds. They shot straight down out of the clouds, fromed a circle, just like in the movie intro, and then spread out. There were about 15 little stars flying down, they seemed to hit the water and spread out to the west. These small lights flew at about 200mph when they came close to the water, never touched it, and spread out on the west side of the Sawmill Lake. I have been camping here at that time 30yrs. and never saw anything like this! These little lites streamed through the trees like firflies. But at 200mph! 4 of them stopped at what I knew to be an abandoned trail, the others were still flying through the campsites. One of the lites left the area on the far but close side of the lake and flew through the woods towards me. I lost track of the rest, this one was coming right for me. It landed on my windshield! I have drawn a picture, and it is not a UFO, but a small creature. The one that left the fold of 4 flew through the woods towards me; and landed on my windshield. It almost looked like a grasshopper. It had the same oval dark eyes; suchtion-cup finger tips, and was about 5&#34;tall. I spoke to it mentally... I Thought i Had died and they were there for me...NO! It flew away, wings and all, rejoined the other lights at the center of the lake and flew straight, with his/her friends; straight UP from where they came. This was not a UFO, but some kind of close encounter...s! o has an yone reported something like this? Aliens not in a ship? Aliens just here in some sort of glowing gold bubble? with wings, feet, hands, etc.etc. WOW Someone help me here.... my 2nd; and VERY different CE3rdK.

4/14/02 03:00|Las Vegas|NV|Changing|20 minutes|Illuminated object that seemed to change shape flying over The Strip at night|5/14/02|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/022/S22688.html|113|ndxe200204| Illuminated object that seemed to change shape flying over The Strip at night<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was on the rooftop of a night club (on Las Vegas Blvd. near W. Tropicana) when I noticed a strange slightly illuminated shape in the distance. My first impression due to the object&#39;s shape and speed was that someone had let off a large cluster of helium party balloons and the wind was carrying them. I thought the hotel and street lights along The Strip were illuminating the object. A few minutes later, I looked up and noticed the object was a bit closer and I became a bit more curious as I began to see some detail. First, rather than being a cluster of objects (aka balloons), it seemed like a more continuous mass where parts of the object had a dull glow of various intensity that changed, as if there were slowly moving parts that were rotating as the object moved forward. The object was about half the size of a fist at arm&#39;s length at the closest point as it passed. The object&#39;s flight path seem to run parallel along The Strip during the first 10-15 minutes after I first spotted it. And its velocity seemed constant - it moved very slow. In fact, it was pretty breezy outside, so I would think a mass of balloons would be drifting by faster and moving erratically assuming the wind speed was constant higher up. The precise movement of this object gave me the impression as if &#34;it&#34; was spying on the activity of The Strip below. It seemed to be positioned right above The Strip but fairly high up. As the object moved further north along The Strip, passing by the building I was on, the lights remained about the same intensity. Again, it&#39;s as though certain parts of the object would move every once in a while, causing some of the lights to shift. I could see where from a distance, someone would classify the shape as a diamond at times due to the main illuminated areas being on the ends of the object. However, the shape seemed to change as the lights moved (or illuminated parts moved?). If I were to assign a color to the object, it was a dull mottled color, lighter than a gray, almost like a tan or light brown.! I point ed out the object to a few friends and joked around that it was a UFO coming to join our party. However, my friends were not very sober and lost interest quickly. I, on the hand, was completely sober. I had celebrated a friend&#39;s event the night before, so I had decided to take it easy and drink non-alcoholic beverages all night. I noticed at some point, the object made an abrupt turn and started heading westward. The lights did not change as the object moved over an area off The Strip which was not as illuminated, again suggesting the object had its own light source. As the object went further west, it became too small to see and was out of view eventually. The entire sighting was about 20 minutes. Being the rational person I am (I have a B.S. in Biology from a top university) and with all the literature I&#39;ve read on the UFO phenomenom and common explanations such as military craft, I thought this might have been one of those private, experimental craft that some hobbyists like to build (they look like hang-gliders with propellers). I&#39;ve read a couple stories where some jokers flew in unison with these craft with lights stringed across and tried to fool the public into believing they saw an extraterrestrial UFO sighting. Anyway, it was 3am, so if it was some kind of trick, someone was motivated. Alternately, it could have been a military craft, e.g. unmanned aerial vehicle, on a test run, considering LV&#39;s proximity to nearby installations.<n>

I also saw this formation change about 5 minutes later, split into 2 formations, one reminded me of a kite, but i now know it was replicating the Little Dipper.

I went outside to sneak upon her.  As I was approaching her I looked up to the North and saw two airplanes, one flying South and banking East to make an approach to Mitchell airfield.  The other was much higher and heading North West leaving behind it a vapor trail.  Immediately upon fixing my eyes on those airplanes I saw a small circle shaped grayish colored object streak across the sky in a Westerly direction.  I tried to get my wife to see it but she looked toward the direction of the airplanes and discounted what I had to say.  With my eyes fixed on this new object I walked around the back of the cars to get a better look.  This object was flying in a straight line, and the only noise I heard was from the first airplane which was on approach.  The UFO was smaller than either airplane and was traveling quite fast.  Also, it was not leaving a vapor trail.  As this object was flying away to a point West of my location it suddenly started to turn, but I didn&#39;t notice a banking movement as with the airplane.  It started making complete counter clockwise circles along the same altitude it was flying, and I made a mental note of how small the flight radius was for such a fast speed.  Well, within a few seconds there appeared a second object, and then a third and a forth.  They were all flying in counter clockwise circles stacked over the same airspace separated by altitude.  The objects were going in and out of view as if they were reflecting off of the sun and then not and then reflecting again.  I estimate watching this for about five minutes when my eyes became strained from the sunlight and I desperately wanted to go get the video camera.  So I went inside and got the camera but when I went back outside I could not find the objects anymore.  There were no news reports of any unusual flying objects.  The weather was sunny, unlimited visibility, 59 degrees F, dew point was 43 degrees F, with a few upper level clouds in the di! stance.<n>

I could not find the objects in the sky from my house so I drove back to my mothers house were the objects was still holding there positions. I video taped them for about 20 minutes, then the objects moved off to the East.

We were there for my brother’s funeral. I am unsure of the exact time but it happened just a few hours before the funeral which was scheduled for 2pm so I estimate that it was around 10am but it could have been 10:30am. My mother may remember what time it happened. My husband and I had a room on third floor on the north side of the building and my mother, grandmother and a friend had a room on third floor on the south side of the building. We were over in my mother&#39;s and grandmother&#39;s room visiting when my mother said she needed to get something out of her rental car and wanted me to go out with her because she wanted to tell me something. The car she rented was parked in the parking lot on the north side of the building right near the entrance. In the late morning this side is in the shadow of the hotel. The lobby had entrances on both sides of the building. So we took the elevator down and then my mother told me what she wanted to tell me. Then she proceeded to look in the car for something. She didn’t find it in the trunk so she opened the front passenger side door and was leaning into the car looking through a bag of stuff. I stood next to the car with my back to the building looking north. As I stood there, motion to my right caught my attention and I turned to look and saw what looked like a bubble, like the bubbles kids blow from a soap solution. It was traveling from the direction of the freeway towards the back of the building. It came down the aisle the way a car would have except that it was floating about 6 ft above the ground. As it got closer I realized it wasn’t a kids bubble but then I remembered that rubbery kind that the kids blow through a tube but as it got closer yet then I knew it wasn’t that either. It just glided along and then just as it passed the back of my mother’s rental car and up to the sidewalk leading into the hotel, it suddenly turned to the left like it was go! ing towa rds the entrance to the hotel but then it turned again and headed right for me but just as it got near me it also increased in altitude a few inches. So I was just standing there trying to figure out what it was and I finally said to my mother, “Look at this” and she backed away from the car and stood up and looked and she didn’t see it approach us and so her perception was off and she thought it was larger but further away and said, “Oh, a kids balloon” and I said, “No, it’s closer” and she said, “Yeah, you’re right” and then she started talking up a storm about what it might be. We both sensed an intelligence about it and felt as though it were looking at us. As we stood there staring at it I sort of heard in my head the name of my brother. It was like the orb communicated telepathically. The hair stood up on the back of my neck at that point because it scared me but I then discounted it and thought, ‘how could this be my brother and what would would an orb have to do with my brother.’ Then I remembered something my husband had watched just a couple weeks or so before about spirit orbs near battle grounds. The orb was about the size of a softball or slightly larger and it was pearly white with a little discoloration on the bottom just to the left (from my viewing perspective). After hovering there for a while then it reversed the original flight path until it got to the back of the car and then it floated along the drivers side of the car back towards the hotel and then went up and over the top of the hotel. We lost sight of it after that and so my mother hurried up and shut the car door and we raced through the lobby of the hotel to go out the other door on the south side to see if we could see it again. We did see it again. It seemed to light up or catch the sunlight differently sometimes because sometimes we could see it very well as though it were a light and other times we couldn’t. Then finally we couldn’t see it anymore. It was heading sort of southwest towards some mountains off in the distance! while g aining quite a bit of altitude. When we couldn’t see it anymore we headed back upstairs and as we stepped off the elevator on third floor, my husband was standing there. He didn’t know what was taking me and my mother so long and was about to come down and look for us to find out. So we told him what we had seen and right away he said that it was my brother. I don’t know what I saw except that it showed intelligence and watched us and knew the name of my brother. I want to know what that was and why it happened just before my brother&#39;s funeral and how it knew we would be there and how it knew my brother&#39;s name. It is creepy when anyone knows stuff about you when they shouldn&#39;t.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I have to admit that I was kind of wondering if I would see something strange in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Almost directly above my head  I saw three dim, but clear lights, (they appeared to be stars, solid white)  moving across the sky in a triangle pattern.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They did not move in a totally even pace but constantly normalized themselves in what appeared sort of like a stuttering action so that they kept in a basic triangle formation.  They continued moving in the same direction for approximately one minute and covered about half of the night sky or a little less.  After the minute or so the first one in formation just kind of shrunk and pinched out of sight and the other two did the same once they reached the point in the sky where the other one had pinched out.  The pattern they had been moving in was one of the three leading the other two which took up flanking positions in the rear.  It was like a triangle being led by one of its points.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Two things keep me looking at the skies Ever since fourteen or so I have kind of wondered if I would see something in the sky strange because my friend and I had seen a star, solid white, move across half the sky over about two minutes and then just all of a sudden without stopping it just changed directions and went back the other way across the whole sky.  He and I both witnessed this and we talked about the details again recently.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I believe it was that same year, 14,  (i am 24 now) when I had a dream that there was one of those aliens that you always see in movies like &#39;fire in the sky&#39;.  I had been sleeping in the basement while the rest of my family slept on the second story of our house.  The way the dream went was very strange.  I remember kids were playing with a ball of some sort and then a door to my left opened and one of those aliens was behind it.  The strange thing is that the dream faded away and I was in my basement and one of those things was just standing in the dingy doorway to my basement at the foot of the stairs.  I did not believe I was dreaming at this point.  I tried to hold myself up from my bed, and resolved that I was going to fight this thing.  Then it just went black.  I woke up on my bed with my legs hanging off and my blanket on the ground.  I ran up the stairs and I noticed that the side door lock which went directly to the basement was broken and hanging upside down on the door.  I didn&#39;t sleep for a couple weeks after that except sparingly in an armchair.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((name deleted))<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness may have observed three satellites, possibly the U.

I joined her on the deck and saw a red and green light that were close together. I assumed it was an airplane, but it suddenly made a sharp movement to the side, then an up and movement. Now the side to side movement could resemble a very wide winged plane with the wing lights flashing alternatly. But this didn&#39;t explain the up and down movement. Also the light stayed in the same place, every so often jerking to one side or the other or up and down. I looked around and observed an identical light in the western sky with the same movements. We watched for about 1/2 hour and they stayed in the same position. My wife went to bed and I continued to read. At a little after 11 PM I went out to check and the light in the southwest was gone, but the western one was in the same position and still jerking around. I got my binoculars, hoping to see more but the light just was sharper. As I was watching two more of the same type lights appeared in the northwestern sky. These acted the same but also blinked off and then on every so often. After about another 1/2 hour these two lights suddenly moved at an extremely fast speed toward the western light and when they neared it they disappeared. Now these two lights seemed smaller or further away. When I went to bed an hour later the west light was still there. I can think of no logical explanation. All the light were red and green and seemed to be very close together.<n>

It reappeared and made a 90 degree turn toward the West, vanished again, reappeared and moved toward the East, vanished again, reappeared and moved toward the North where it vanished over the horizen miles away.  The object was a bright, white burn of light, no other color was visable, no flashing light of any sort.  Our weather here tonight is low, dense cloud cover and this object was well below the cloud cover and made absolutely no noise.

I went outside as sometimes I can  obtain better reception when outside the house. It had been raining most of the day so the night was overcast but no rain. As we back up to the woods we are somewhat isolated from other neighbors so there were no distractions or any other lighted areas. I was leaning on the South side of my deck at around 10:10 pm talking to our friends when in the distance coming from the north I saw through the trees a flash of light I could not initially distinguish the color as looking thru the trees dulled any color recognition. I want to add that our house sits in a slight valley as we are in the foot hills of the appalation mountains so  there are many high and low areas.I did not think to much of this light but noticed it was coming in my direction low and in my direction. Once it came over the tree line I [which is about 150 yards from where I was standing] had a better view of something traveling south putting out a bright green light. The light  looked to me like a straw or a cigar object. The light came on every approx. 2 to 3 seconds directly over our house continuing south then out of sight over another tree covered area. There were no engine noises, no other lights. It was not a shooting star. This situation was so unusual that I had to report it. As far as my background is concerned I am presently a Vice President of an insurance company.<n>

A line of light appeared in the sky above the pasture just across from the deck for which we were on.  There were 3 lights total in a straight line/split into 3rds (- - -).  The lights were brite orange and became brighter prior to its disappearance. This sighting appeared out of no where and left in a flash.  I have never in my life experienced such a thing. It was really beautiful experience.<n>

I was slowing down to stop at a light, noticed a very large object ,above the tallest trees but lower than the top of Mauna Kea. What I saw was a huge silver object which seemed to turn, and then it looked like a very dark colored wedge type shape,the larger end was on the bottom and and it was at about a 45 degree angle and I was watching it as I had to go once the light changed, I kept my eye on it and it disappeared before I could stop and look at it.  The weirdest, most unexplained event I have ever seen. The sighting was so brief. Never heard of anyone one else who saw it. I am reporting this months after the fact. I did not think it was a ufo at first...but what else could it have been? I am a graphic designer and consider myself a sharp observer.<n>

At first I didn&#39;t think anything of it because that night we had seen three planes and five satellites crossing the sky in the same area.  This object flashed a strange bluish-white light that gave off a sharp triangular appearance.  I soon realized that it couldn&#39;t have been a plane because those give off repetative rythmical flashes.  This object&#39;s flash was not like that.  It would flash, pause a second, flash two or three times, pause a couple seconds, then back to one flash, then one long pause, then flash again.  It just repeated like this, very unrandomly for about 7 or 8 secs.   Then suddenly and without warning it made a sharp and quick 90% turn west, flashed again, then was gone.  I also noticed that when it wasn&#39;t flashing, the object seemed to have a grayish-metallic spherical appearance to it.    I don&#39;t know what I saw, I just know I&#39;ve never seen anything like it before. I should also probably mention that an aircraft came to the exact position of this object.  It arrived only seconds after it left.<n>
4/11/02 14:00|Midland|TX||5 minutes|White light establishes message to two witnesses in Texas|5/29/12|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/089/S89098.html|133|ndxe200204| White light establishes message to two witnesses in Texas<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am submitting this report to the National UFO Reporting Center  This may seem far fetched, but this is a true account of what has happened.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This report shall include only six experiences, three of which have witnesses.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I do recognize that its arrival to you is not in a timely fashion as one would expect, yet its relevance to today is key.<n> <n><n> <n><n> One experience considered A by this report took place in 1966 while outside my grandmother’s house in Texas.  As my brothers, sister and myself were playing in the summer evening, we were playing hide and seek.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The spot to count was at the front steps of the the front portch of the house. After counting, I said ready or not here I come!  What took place next as I glanced up to the peak of my grandmother’s house, I noticed a light. What seemed interesting to me was that it appeared to be coming closer.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I watched as the light grew larger as it appeared to be coming directly to me. I wasn’t afraid but curious. It suddenly was directly above the house approximately 50ft in the air.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was completely silent. What I saw was a craft about the size of the house, I know this because it hovered above moving forward as if it was looking at me. I was able to see all the detail and other lights of different colors.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I looked at its detail while it hovered forward which lasted about thirty seconds, it quickly shot upward disappearing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I saw, they thought it silly and discounted it as childhood imagination.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Another incident considered B of this report took place on February 9, 1971 in California.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had turned eight the day before, which really didn’t change anything. It seemed I was always in trouble. That evening nothing really changed. I remember observing the T.V. glow coming through the closed door jam while crying myself to sleep.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Close Encounter: February 9, 1971  I awoke from deep sleep - - - somehow completely awake. It was dark as all the lights were out. I looked at the closed door in silence. I didn’t know why I suddenly became awake, but what did become apparent was that the closed door became transparent and disappeared. I was able to see the coffee table and the couch in the living room. As I looked I could hear what I recognize as energy becoming present accompanied by a light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The light expanded from the midst of the living room completely filling its area with a pure white presence. Nothing else became visible in its presents.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I sat upon my bed, I remember looking at my hands being lightened up by the light. The lights refective beauty was only visible upon the bunk bed I was on.<n> <n><n> <n><n> While looking directly into the light, I couldn’t help but feeling closeness, as if I was seeing an old friend.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The light was not blinding, as its presence expressed peace. After a few minutes of what I call a light bath, the bed moved. I looked upward and noticed my brother glancing to look down at me. It was obvious that he too, was witnessing the light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> He looked toward the light as if wondering about its presents. He also wasn’t fearful. He glanced back at me as if to verify what he was witnessing. It felt good to see his smile as he noticed the smile on my face. We both smiled.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In a little while my brother and I witnessed the light implode. Its memory is unforgettable.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The importance of what took place was a question to my mind, but it would not provide relevance until later that morning.<n> <n><n> <n><n> By naïve perception, its reality couldn’t be comprehended by those whose experience it wasn’t.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Within myself I recognized its significance, but could others? My brother and myself tried telling our father about what had happened, but he didn’t believe us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> February 9, 1971 at 6:02 a.m. The Sylmar earthquake 6.6-7.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Reagan declared state of emergency.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I remember the aftershocks continuing through-out the morning. I knew within my being that it was related. The light imparted that seed of reality. A communication if you will as that which would be unfolded in the future.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As a child I was yet to recognize the importance of that experience, even though the reality of the experience existed in what was unfolding. Was it a glimpse of what the future could experience?  Are we destined to that result by our ignorance of the reality of the essence of the light?  A universal secret was that communication which would reveal itself in proper time to be united with another experience in the future. I needed first to experience the result of its misuse by mankind.<n> <n><n> <n><n> March 1971 C:  Approximately one month had gone by. My father had decided to move the beds around after the earthquake. No longer on the bunk bed, I was now sleeping on a twin close to the window.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I awoke to see a light orb appear in the room. It was small in size, approximately the size of a basketball. It was floating silently in the air.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Because of the experience of February 9th, and the ridicule I experienced by my father, I was unsure of what to do. I pulled my cover over me and waited a couple of minutes. Bringing the cover back down that I can see, I noticed it was gone. I fell back to sleep.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About a week later, another orb appeared just as before only it was hovering moving slowly left to right. Instead of pulling the sheet over me I turned my back, that I face away closing my eyes, hoping it would go away as before. After a few minutes, I turned to see it was gone. I fell asleep.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Approximately one week later it happened again. This time remembering how the light of February 9th and how I wasn’t afraid, I decided to watch what it does.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I watched, it floated in the air silently slowly traveling to each of from my brother’s beds.  What was it doing? I wondered. Soon it was at the foot of my bed where it stopped.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I looked at its light wondering what it would do next. It was obviously trying to show me something. But what? I then noticed that it began to travel very slowly alongside my bed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was coming closer in a way not to alarm me. As it approached close to where my head was resting I positioned myself to get a better look.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It hovered along side as I looked at it. As I was facing its presence, It inched forward closer to my head resting only about four inches from my face. I looked at it with no fear, but with curiosity. What was it seeing? And what part did I have to do with it? After about two minutes it disappeared. I was now in the darkness of the night. I lay there, wondering if I should say anything. I soon fell asleep.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Nothing of this nature would happen again, except that I would experience moments of seeing into the future as if the light imparted within me a gift, which I know is a different subject than UFO’s, but it is related.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Beginning in the month of April 2001 a motivation toward numbers began within me. I was compelled to write it down.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What would soon unfold was a sequence of numbers I’m sure was imparted to me February 9, 1971 but held dormant until this process, and that its essence I would discover was base providing germ concept as source to all sacred within all religions.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It even reflected the floor plan of the temple at Luxor. What I soon realized, was that its structure had been used by all ancient peoples and was not limited to religion. I developed various charts to show there correlation with number.<n> <n><n> <n><n> August 16, 2001, D: While outside in my yard, my wife and I were staring up at the night sky, when a light was moving up above in was coming downward. It stopped as if noticing my telling my wife to look. It began to slowly move westward, I mention to my wife that it was as if it was knowledgeable of us looking at it. It immediately shot away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> (Channeling) September 1, 2001 E: While instructing my wife to dial my ex-wife that I may talk to her, she accidentally dialed 911 instead of the area code 915, she hung up, Immediately a call came back from the call center asking if we dialed 911, she told them it was an error. I confirmed that it was an error. They said that an officer would never the less show up to verify.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It frustrated me that they wouldn’t listen. I walked over and leaned against a shelf, while my wife was on the phone with them. The shelf dislodged and collapsed, causing a crashing noise. The woman on the other end of the phone asked what that noise was.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We tried explaining what it was, and that no officers were needed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> She said they were outside. They verified that nothing was wrong and left.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Suddenly as if being channeled through my mind was a warning. I immediately told my wife to call back as I had a real EMERGENCY to reveal. After contacting dispatch I proceed to describe that something terrible was about to take place and that thousands were going to die. That there would be twenty bombers involved. Details are on the 911 recording. I was instructed to tell the responding officers.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The responding supervisor with the local sheriff’s office heard me out. He told me that there was nothing he could do. As far as he was concerned, he hadn’t heard anything from his bossed to forewarn about something about to happen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I pleaded with him to listen, as this was very real. I’m sure he thought I was crazy. He chose to ignore what I was saying. As they walked away, I pleaded with them to listen and do something. They said there is nothing they could do, as they got into their patrol cars. I began to yell at the top of my lungs, “Your wrong, Your wrong, people are going to die. They never the less drove off. We all know what happened n September 11 2001.<n> <n><n> <n><n> F: April 11, 2002  Being outside in our yard with my son, my wife and my two dogs, I was looking up at the clouds. They looked normal as cloud cover could be, but they began to change, becoming a blanket of clouds in square formations.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Much more than I have explained in the past, I give detail here.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Within me was a confidence of peace and discovery, for I welcomed its appearance.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I recognized that something was not in the realm of natural expression.. A power not recognized was manipulating the clouds structure. What power established this I asked myself.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Soon it developed two points of rotation which was witnessed by my son. Its development gave expression of creation process as I would discover. (The summary process is described within a publication) I needed to bring this knowledge into our current reality.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What ultimately took place, was that which can be likened from Isaiah 44:8: 		“Drop down from above O heavens and let the cloud pour down righteousness. Let the earth open and let salvation bear fruit and let righteousness sprout together. [……] Woe to him who fights with his former”    I really do care what you do with this report. What is done about it will reflect the future of mankind. It is a choice after all.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.  PD))<n>

They didn&#39;t just turn off but instead they faded very slowly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There were seven of us though only three saw it.

I&#39;m not quite sure where we were, all I know is that we were at a pullout on the highway somewhere.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I think we were facing W.S.W. and it was about 70° up.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness does not state what direction the lights were traveling, but we suspect they were moving, but we suspect he may have been witness to three satellites flying in formation.

There were  4 circles of light that would come together as one, then break apart again.  The real bizarre thing was they started to follow us as we made our way back to the house.  We were walking very rapidly out of fear.  They eventually come very close to the house, but still high up in the air.  This happened awhile ago I just never acted on it, figuring it has to have an explanation.  However to all I have shown it to, I have yet to get an answer.  Everyone I know states they have never seen anything like it.  Which leads me here.  I can&#39;t really explain it too well it is something that must be seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We wonder whether the witnesses might have observed advertising lights.  PD))<n>

My son saw something just above the car on the passenger side and asked me what it was. I could not see it until at that moment, it passed over the car to my side just above the tree line about 50 feet above the car.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had never seen anything like it in my life. It was a UFO that was cigar or rectangle shaped, bigger than a tour bus, dark gray colored, covered in round gold lights on the bottom, (10-12 lights)and had a bright orange &#34;comet tail&#34; on the end.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The lights were like balls of sunshine floating in clear spheres of liquid. It was silent. No sound at all even though it was right over us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It traveled alongside of us for about 30 seconds at 40 mph, went up in the sky several thousand feet in a fraction of a second and came back to tree level just ahead of us and glided down the road toward the lake at fast pace until it disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were all in shock. My son in the back seat said that I could no longer deny the existence of UFOs. He was so excited at that moment because he has always wanted to see one.I have never believed in them before I saw it for myself. I have not slept well since and cannot stop thinking about it.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Sky was partly cloudy at night.  Lights were in front of any cloud cover and no noise present.  While this occurred there were a very high number of aircraft in the sky, as many as 10.  The aircraft didn&#39;t appear to be jets or helicopters.  After this event, air traffic slowed to the usual several per minute.  I took video of the event and will send it in at a later time.<n>

All outside lighting was off so we could star-watch on this clear night. As we reclined in our chairs looking up, I noticed a dim amberish solid light moving across the sky. It looked as though it was at a very high altitude, moving very fast. At one point in the sky, it changed direction, 90 degrees. As this light moved out of sight, I noticed another one. The second one was following the same path, but didn&#39;t make the 90 degree turn. The third moved across taking another path. As we were wondering what we were seeing, I noticed two other lights moving towards each other. When they moved closer to each other, they each made a half circle in opposite directions, as to avoid colliding. Then the two lights continued to move away from each other until out of site.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There were no sounds associated with these lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I saw the two lights swirl away from each other, I got weak and shaky. It was very weird and shocking. I hope someone else witnessed this.<n>

It was a clear blue sky with a few white clouds passing by it. It never moved just hung there motionless. At first I thought it was a Balloon but it never drifted with the wind. The clouds were moving by it but it never changed position. I watched it for about 5 minutes curious at what it was and even looked for someone else around to show it too but of course no one was there. What struck me as being unusual is it was a Breezy day but it had no effect on it moving with the wind. I had to continue on to work so I never got to see it leave. It gave me kind of an Eeerie feeling because I felt it was watching me. If I had a camera and took a photo it would have been just a small silver dot on the photo with little detail. It was shiny and looked silver to me because it did have a glare off it. It basically looked like a Silver Ball hanging in the air.<n>

It took only about 6 seconds to move completely across the whole skyk, but it was moving too slow to be a meteor.

And I looked up to look at the nightsky and when I did I thought what I saw was a meteorite coming down or skipping around on the atmosphere. So I kept looking but then in less than 3 seconds it turned and began to move very quickly. It was zig zaging like a a person shining a pen light on a board and moving it in motions like a composure. That is why I thought it was a meteorite skipping off the atmosphere at first. Then I realized that it was going in and out and underneath and above the clouds. It moved from the first time I saw it from my right to my left and then continued toward the south all in the space of about 10-30 seconds. Nothing to my knowledge could have even endured the Gforces. Also the speed was tremendous. It traveled at about 5 miles within 5 seconds.I had already pointed it to my mother and at first she thought I was joking then she saw it. She said she would never get over it. I too am as amazed. I have wanted to see something like this for 22 years and now it&#39;s happened. I would also like to make clear that it looked like a firefly (except no trails of light behind) and that it was not only going above and through clouds it would also be clearly seen from the backdrop of space. There was no light from the ground creating it also. This light was very clearly a UFO and it like I said looked like a firefly form where I was standing but the way it moved in the sky and above the clouds and around I know it was not because it was as high up as the clouds.<n>

It was about 3.30 to 4 o&#39;clock in the morning and still pitch black outside. ((deleted)) I glanced up at the sky and stars above me. After about 10 seconds I noticed a bright yellow ball of light in the distance, very far away. I thought it was just a plane and it wasn&#39;t till it appeared to be coming in the direction of the house that I started paying attention. I told my friend to turn around and look and after about another ten seconds it went from the size of a coin or golfball to a tennisball at arms length. This was when I realised it wasn&#39;t a plane. We continued to observe it while it passed over our heads (completely soundlessly) and we even went to my front yard and watched it until our view became obstructed by buildings. It traversed the distance of being a speck in the distance to clearing my house in approximately 3 minutes. The funny thing is, in the newspaper the next day it stated that at least 30 other people had reported the same yellow light and more! I&#39;ll never forget it, it was very eerie.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous.  PD))<n>

One of my friends was a witness to the siting, we both saw the same field of white light flash above us, speeding forward across the sky. The best way I can describe the ufo&#39;s diameter and height from us, is that it was probably the length of two school buses and that it was around a four or five story buildings height above us. I am a high school student and are I currently living with my parents. My friend who witnessed the siting with me is of the same age as me and does not attend school.

There is a great deal of commercial and military air traffic in this area, so I was watching the sky. As I watched I saw what I first thought was a regular aircraft light, i.e. a commercial airliner &#34;headlight&#34;.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I watched though the light increased n brightness. It was a lightly clouded evening and this object was positioned so that it was ringed (as though it were in the center -the doughnut hole- of a &#34;doughnut-lke&#34; cloud formation). It was a very dark night, I&#39;m not sure if it was a new moon or the moon had already set.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I could not tell the distance, but it seemed clearly too far for even an airliner light source to be so bright. Also it appeared to be stationary for the duration of my sighting. It became bright enough to illuminate the surrounding edges of the cloud formation that it was in. It grew and diminished slighty in brightness, until it eventually disappeared (it seemed to have &#39;winked out&#39; rather than sped off).<n> <n><n> <n><n> Very shortly after the lght&#39;s disappearence, a smaller plane, what I would perceive as a military or private sized plane (I do not know which), passed very quickly through an closely adjacent region of the sky. This craft did not appear to be the same object, but I presumed was there to &#39;check out&#39; the light. I am not sure of this this is pure speculation.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I consider myself a relatively competent observer (I am a visual artist), and I was a bit taken aback by the prominence of ths object in the night sky.<n>

We had rented a Ford Mustang and were joyriding one humid evening after dinner.  We had been all over town, ate some pineapple, and were on our way home when we decided it was too early to turn in for the night and we kept on driving. We had the top down and the system up, listening to our favorite Usher song, as sped down the road.  For some reason, we turned down a road we were not very familiar with, and with each passing sign, we got a little more nervous.  It was an unlit rundown road with no other cars. We knew we were miles outside of town, but we didn’t care. We were having the time of our life until the road drastically began to narrow and we passed more peculiar signs, warning against trespassing.  Either we thought nothing of it or we were feeling brave that day, none the less we resumed our adventure to the lava flow and kept on driving. As she drove I was gazing at the stars. I shouted in excitement when  I saw the most amazing shooting star of my life. Like a jettisoned rocket it flung across the sky, and I quickly made a wish. It began to fade, then to my surprise the star didn’t burn out, but stopped suddenly, and went back in the direction it had come from.  The star got brighter and now my friend had stopped the car, and we both watched in amazement as this bright object flew across the Heavens.  It was the strangest thing I had ever seen.  What I had first thought was a beautiful star, had turned into a phenomenon.  My friend right away shrilled “ALIENS!” As soon as she said that, a bone chilling fear ran through my body.  The bright light came closer and closer and I was screaming for my friend to turn the car around and go home.  The road was so narrow that it took us a while to turn around, and now it was apparent that there was what appeared to be a large, oval spacecraft headed right towards us at incredible speeds. It made a loud humming noise and had bright lights in a sparatic pattern. The! lights were very bright and some were colored. My friend was so frightened and frozen in shock that she couldn’t drive. As it came in closer the engine of the car turned off. She frantically turned it back on. I was pushing her foot on the gas petal, and as the motor revved loudly the spacecraft neared. It hovered above us for about a mile, as she drove as fast as the car would go, and I thought I was going to die. But as we neared the town the spacecraft sped out of sight. I was so relieved, but I will never be the same knowing that there is life other than us out there. We were not intoxicated or on any medication at the time. What we saw was real.<n>

He saw a flier on the wall at the Vernon library requesting that if anyone has witnessed an unusual object in the skies to write or call me. So he did. The witnessed lived at one time in Terrace, British Columbia and had rented a moving truck and was moving to Vernon, B.C. he had everything packed up and hit the road early on April 6, 2002 and started his long journey to his new home. He passed through the small community of Clinton, B.C. which is midway between Vancouver and Prince George and is located 39 kms north of the Trans Canada Highway #1 and Cariboo Highway #97 junction, having an elevation of 887 meters. The population of Clinton currently stands at approximately 740. As he was driving south a few kilometers out of Clinton, B.C on a straight stretch of road at dawn when he noticed something rather unusual way off in the horizon. He said he was able to observe a dot, or very small object which seemed to be floating around, still very far away at this time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As he drove, he slowed because what ever this was he was looking at was acting really strange and it started growing larger in size due to it heading in his direction. The witness told me, his Dad is a pilot, his Uncle is a pilot and his cousin is a pilot and he said he has been around aircraft all his life and knew what he was seeing was something he had never observed before. He also reports that what ever it was had no strobe lights on it, as it drew closer the object took on a metallic silver color to it. The shape was that of a saucer type craft, and as it approached it dropped in altitude to approx:1000 feet and flew straight over top of the truck he was driving, moving at an incredible rate of speed.  He also told me the object was approx: 60 feet across and the bottom of it was completely black in color. Just as the object passed over head his eye caught sight of another craft of the same kind and it to passed overhead quickly and both objects were out of sight within a second or two. The objects were traveling north to east. He said there was not a sound to be heard. He immediately pulled the truck over to the side of the road and jumped out to see if he might be able to see something in the distance, but these objects were gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thank you to the witness for the report.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Brian Vike, Director HBCC UFO Research Canadian Toll Free UFO Hotline 1 866 262 1989 - Free call.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Home - Phone/Fax 1 250 845 2189 HBCC UFO Forum Board http://216.147.50.102/HBCC-UFO/index.php email: hbccufo@telus.net Website: http://www3.telus.net/public/wilbur8/hbcc_ufo_research.htm<n>

It seemed to be hanging in the sky some distance south of Sacramewnto, California and west of Highway 99. It was defined only by its lights, making it hard to tell its exact shape. It looked like a Y at first and then seemed to turn &amp; become triangular, without changing its location. One light was pulsing, the others, in a row, were steady. The pulsing light was in front of the others and vanished as it turned. Even at that distance it looked very large. I watched it alone for about 20 minutes, going to the fence and looking between the posts to be sure it didn&#39;t move. Then I went to get a friend. We were back within 5 minutes and watched it for another 15 or 20. It was getting cold, so we went inside. I looked out again about an hour later, but a mist had closed in and I didn&#39;t see it. I left a message at the UFO forum &amp; was given this site to try for a response.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;d appreciate knowing if anyone else in this area saw it when I did.<n>

It almost looked like a star. The light would go in one direction and the turn around and go in the other.  What made it stand out from a plane is that it would stop before turning in the other direction and just hover in the air.  I ran inthe house and told my wife to come watch what was happening.  My mother in law who lives and for boy friend I also told to come out and watch.  We noticed four jets all coming from the same direction heading directly toward the light.  The light then turned and went away from the jets super fast and disappeared over Canandaigua Lake.  neither the jets or the light made a sigle sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

There was no light, eratic movement or change.  simply a thin cloud-like &#34;C&#34; shape moving across the sky.  Had I not been in a reclining posture, I would not have seen it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The form went by rapidly, but not so fast that I didn&#39;t have time to comprehend  what was happening and concentrate on the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Were I to hazard a guess, I would say that a &#34;black&#34; object was moving across the sky  and creating a pressure zone ahead of it&#39;s path.<n>

Suddenly, our attention was drawn to a star right above us that moved verry fast to the right, instead of going streath on, it changed its direction 4 times verry rapidley, and by thus, making an M-form. Then it vanished.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Ever heard of falling stars that changes direction ?<n>

Going from north to south by south east flight line, extremely fast, faster than any jet I ever seen and I seen soem of the fastest jets around. Mgs 29&#39;s are not that fast.  3 white and 2 red lights rotating and flashing, not fixed like normal jets or choppers.  Seen one similar in sisters oregon six years prior.

There was no sound and no lights on the objects. I quickly tried to discount what I was seeing but new it could be nothing I have seen before.

When my husband joined me on the day of the funeral, he told me of this incredible sighting, and believes it could have been a UFO.  He is not absolutely sure that it was a UFO, but he has never seen anything like it before.  Also, he isn&#39;t particularly interested in UFO&#39;s, but he knows enough on the subject, through me, to realize that what he was seeing would definitely fit the description of similar sightings.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We live on a flight path to Pearson, International Airport outside of Toronto, so we are used to the sounds and sights of planes, including flashing lights, their shapes, and sounds, etc.  However, what he saw was completely unfamiliar.  He was just opening the bedroom window, before going to bed.  The window winds outwards, and faces north-east, and as he glanced to the north,  4 very, bright lights caught his eye, as they must have just passed through our property, heading northwards.  He said the object was completely silent.  We live in the country, so we know the sound of silence, and are aware of the times when it is disrupted even slightly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> He described the object as appearing to be one, long completely flat, and rectangular craft (from the angle he was seeing it..retreating).  The lights were flashing or blinking in a pattern, as opposed to being like beams or spotlights, and they were very, bright white.  The object appeared to be descending in a manner that he described with the motion of his hands, (difficult to translate to this page) and it was as though it was descending in steps, as opposed to a smooth transition.  It quickly, and completely disappeared from his view, as it dropped beyond the horizon, just beyond the tiny, hamlet of Mono Centre, located approximately 1/2 kilometer north of our house.  Also, there is a large, Provincial park, just beyond Mono Centre, where the object appeared to descend.  He described its&#39; movements as quick and completely silent.  He was literally stunned, and knew how disappointed I would be that I wasn&#39;t there to share the experience.  I don&#39;t know if this is relevant but there is an Canadian, armed forces base, north of here...Camp Borden.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Our approximate, geographical location is North/West of Toronto, Ontario - 1 hr.&amp; 15-30 minute drive (75 km).  We are on apaved road that runs between Airport Rd. &amp; Highway #10 (Hurontario St.) about 15 minutes (18 km) north of Highway #9 and 15 minutes (18 km) south of Highway #89 and approximately 15 minutes (18 km) north/east from Orangeville, Ontario.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I would be interested to know if anyone else has reported this sighting, particularly, as UFO sightings have increased by 44% in Canada.<n>

The area (if he is describing it correctly) is smack dab in the middle of military property between Alamogordo and Carizozo. I travel in the relative area quite a bit, and there have been many strange, unexplanable sitings including silent, laser-like light shows in the middle of nowhere, light orbs, and extreme brightness in the middle of the night lasting anywhere from 1 or 2 minutes to an hour or two. People who live in the area complain of unexplainable noise and light disturbances as well as earthquake-like ground vibrations.<n> <n><n> <n><n> One siting I can remember quite clearly was about a year and a half ago, I was driving my (now ex) brother-in-law back from Ruidoso to Albuquerque (I lived in ABQ at the time), and we witnessed a WILD laser like show over the horizon in the exact area the caller described. We watched this unexplainable light show for approx. 45 minutes, eventually passing its location and watching it in the mirrors of the car until arriving in Carizozo, in which we could no longer see the area (it was too far behind us). The lights appeared to be only white and very sporatic, but coming from the ground and very bright, lighting up the whole sky around us and extending very far up into and through the clouds. We estimated the distance of the source to be approximately 15-20 acres from the side of the highway.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We (the people of Lincoln County) believe there is a military base under ground, but I am not sure, as there is strict security along the gates, and no one can explore what is really out there without military clearance. There are signs along the fences that read &#34;no trespassing, military personnel only&#34;. The local accepted theory is that the military is participating in technological experiments with air craft and laser weapon technology. Some local military personnel I have spoken to have suggested that this theory is real, but they will not say much more than &#34;you&#39;re close&#34; or &#34;you&#39;ve got the right idea&#34;. I hope this helps!<n>

The time was roughly 7:45pm. I unloaded a suit case and took it into my apartment. I had to make one more trip to bring in a basket of laundry still in the car. When I walked out the front door and happened to looked up 50 to 60 degrees from horizon, approx. due East, temperature in mid to upper 30&#39;s, CLEAR sky, NO clouds visible.  Out of ALL those stars, I look RIGHT AT THE ONE STAR [LIGHT?] THAT TURNED OFF! Just like a light bulb. Weird. I didn&#39;t notice anything strange about the star, until it went out. There were other stars around this one, but it was the brightest star in that small cluster. What are the odds of that? There&#39;s a small airport nearby, but I heard NO engines. This light DIDN&#39;T move and it seemed to be in space, NOT within the atmosphere. Two seconds of observation isnt long enough to get detail on the object other than star like. I stood there listening and watching for any sign of an aircraft strobes and lights, but I saw and heard nothing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Unrelated to this incident: I was in Ebensburg PA. renting some video&#39;s on Saturday March 30th, the clerk checking us out had told me 4 people the night before (29th)had sighted a UFO in the sky above the parking lot. She said the lights were revolving in a circular pattern. I didnt get much detail other than that.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Very good report, we feel.  However, the first two possibilities to be ruled out would be the flash of an Iridium satellite, or the bright flash from a tumbling rocket booster shell.

I looked up because the sky was starting to clear and it had been a rainy day. There was a large cloud overhead and I could see a shadow of an aircraft deep inside. I was watching it just thinking it was an airplane but as it got closer to the surface it was a perfect rectangular shadow and way larger than a jet would be. It had no wings and I could see the outline clearly. I was filled with a sense of foreboding but hoped as it came out of the cloud it would be something recognizable. As it came out of the cloud, it was still a rectangular shadow! It did not make sense to see a shadow on blue sky but I have no other description. It made no sound. It made me very afraid and then I realized there was a line of cars waiting for me to move and I had to look away. This shadow object was very scary and I almost started crying.

The first time I saw this object was in either 1998 or 1999. My boyfriend and I were sitting in a porch swing in front of my house after midnight when I noticed this amber-colored light a few miles away. It was rising vertically in the sky. But what caught my eye the most was that the light was pulsating. It was fading in and out. It was very high in the sky when it became so bright that it looked as if it were going to burst. It then dropped something that looked like shiny gold-colored stuff that sparkled as it fell down. The light then dimmed down until it vanished. Soon after, 2 planes flew over in its direction. My mother later told me that she had also witnessed the light the same night.The second time, I witnessed the same exact thing, in the same exact spot, a few months later by myself. The third time, around March 15th, 2002,my boyfriend and I were driving when we saw the amber light again. This time it was moving above us and only about 5,000 ft in the sky,  probably closer. I stopped my truck and we got out to watch it. There was so much glow around it that I could not make out a shape of the object, let alone,see what it was made out of, and there wasn&#39;t any sound coming from it.When the the light stopped quite a few miles away,  again, it became very bright and dropped the same stuff that we saw before. Then the light just disappeared.And again,planes flew over to the area that the object was last in.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The last time we saw this object it was around 1:30 in the morning today, April 1st (yeah, just what you need, a sighting on April Fools Day). I met my boyfriend at the track at the high school to go jogging after work. We were walking along when I spotted the amber light. It was moving very slowly and doing the same pulsating stuff. This time, when it became VERY bright, it looked as if it produced a red &#34;flare&#34; and then dropped it. The red flare-like thing seemed to burn out before it hit the ground. It repeated this once more before it disappeared. I didn&#39;t notice any other aircraft flying to the area this time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I really wish I could find out what this is. My boyfriend thinks its a military helicopter test. This would have convinced me if the object would have made some sound when we witnessed it up close.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We have received many reports of amber lights over Arizona.  Some of them may be military flares, but follow-up investigation is the only way to distinguish flares from bona fide UFO&#39;s.  PD))<n>
