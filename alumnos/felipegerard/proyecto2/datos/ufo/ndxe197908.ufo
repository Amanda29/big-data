It was landed. He and his friends dimmed the car lights as they were terrified that the entity would see them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My father described the dome as being about the size of a 3bdrm house with panels covering the exterior.  The panels emitted light and were  fluorescent, but he was adamant that they were not colours that we could identify on earth.  As it was the middle of nowhere, they were sure that the object was a landed UFO.  The nearest farmhouse was a few miles away, and whilst they tried to wake the farmer there and show him, they could not.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The next day, a newspaper reported that strange lights had been spotted in the skies over France.<n>

The background of the sky was midnight blue.  Nearly 10:30 pm the background sky was nearly pitch black.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I picked a spot out of the Northern Milky way and watched.  And thats, when the First of Seven jetted across my view.  Extremly high in altitude. I would guess nearly 60,000 feet. Traveling due South.  If I would have blinked my eyes I would have seen nothing. The first object was pitch black ellipse in shape and jagged edges all around.  It was the size of three football fields combined sq. ft. Second and third objects identical in size were directly behind split apart same shape and color. If the those two were combined they would be half the size as the first. Fourth and Fifth identical size, directly behind two and three.  Split apart same color and shapes if combined they would be half the size of object 2 or 3. Sixth object half the size of 4 or 5 directly behind and centered. Seventh object same color and shape half the size as 5.  However, it was offset from the previous 6 craft and out of formation from the group.  All were traveling extremly fast.  They bolted from the far Northern View of the Milky to the South under 10 seconds.  I have a photographic memory of what I saw.  They crossed my window of view and one could barely distingish let alone see them because the color was so black and the background sky was nearly black.  They made no sound. As I&#39;m watching them I tell my friend and look off them for a second or two to point them out to my friend.  It took 2 or 3 second relocate them.  Within one or two seconds they vanished into Far South through large Cumulus Anvil cloud that was 100 miles away to the South of North Platte, Ne. Definately, UFO&#39;s I could see them visibly because they blacked out the stars lights as the passed over my view.  Definately 7 objects total.  Group of six were in perfect formation following the leader. I could distingish them as seperate because I could see the stars between objects.  The Seventh object was trailing the group seem to keep it distance from the main body.  All seven were of the exact make just the sizes varied from largest to smallest. Anyhow, I got the best view and my friend only seen a glipse of what I witnessed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.  PD))<n>

My husba|6/23/99|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/008/S08051.html|4|ndxe197908| While traveling along a country road one night from Snellville to Stone Mountain, we saw an aircraft slowly moving toward us.  My husband and I thought it was a small plane or helicopter until it got close and low to our car.  It then followed us down the road for several miles until we got to our house - then flew off and disappeared.  The craft made no sound and had three large glowing center lights on the bottom.  You could barely see the shape of the craft behind the bright lights but it looked triangular.  The light did not shine onto the car or street.  There was no wind.  Afterward, the Atlanta Journal reported several sightings of this craft around the city during the same week.  My husband remembers the lights to be white in color and I remember them to be muted red, orange, and yellow.  I am curious as to why we have different perceptions about such a memorable sight.  We were extremely frightened because no matter what speed we were going, it hovered directly above us.  We looked out the windows and even stopped to get a better look at one point.  It stopped when we stopped, then continued to follow us when we drove ahead.<n>

We immediately noticed a large red light blinking about 1/4 mile up the creek that looked similar to a radio tower light only we knew there was no radio tower at that location.  Then we thought it might be a helicopter since it wasn&#39;t moving.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Mr ((name deleted)) cut the engine on the boat but there was no sound coming from that direction.  As we sat there pondering what it might be, the light intensefied and started moving slowly at first coming our way.  It then picked up speed and passed by us at tree top level about 150 feet away, the light turning from red to greenish white and was about the size of a school bus.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As the light moved out over the lake, it suddenly shot almost straight up at a tremendous speed turning solid white and looked like it went up into the stars. As we all sat there completely amazed, the light started moving back our way and when it got back over our location, it started moving in a &#34;box&#34; formation directly overhead.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We sat and watched this thing for several minutes.  Mr. ((name deleted)) then fired up the engine and we started back up the lake to his marina which was about four miles away. When we had gotten about half-way up the lake, the soldier hollered: &#34;The Damn thing is coming back at us&#34;.  We all turned to look and it was coming down about a 45 degree angle and was growing in size.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Mr. ((name deleted)) shoved the throttle to the firewall and we were moving about 70 MPH when suddenly, on a very dark night, a beam or shaft of light suddenly hit our boat, turning night into day and lighting up the lake immensily.  It scared the heck out of all of us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Mr ((name deleted)) turned off the lake into the creek leading to his marina running flat out and there was a highway bridge that we had to pass under.  As we approached the bridge, the light suddenly went out and he &#34;shot&#34; that bridge (which only had about a ten foot clearance)and barely missed the pilings.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When we got back to the dock, we all discussed what we had seen for several minutes and then decided that none of us would tell what we had seen since we thought no one would surely believe us.  We only had one six-pack of beer between the four of us, so no one was drunk or even high for that matter.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We made a pact to say absolutely nothing about this incident for 20 years and as far as I know, not one of us broke that pact.  I have no idea what we were looking at, where it came from or where it went  There was absolutely no noise coming from this &#34;thing&#34;.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date is approximate.

We had heard a light buzzing sound and turned around to see a craft with orangeish colored lights, hovering less than 20 yards from us.  That is all any of the three of us remember and in fact we didn&#39;t talk about it for almost ten years, like it had been teporarily erased from our memories, until one night when someone brought up UFO&#39;s and the three of us spoke up about our experience.  How could someone put something like that into the back of their brains.  After talking about it for awhile, none of us recalled the craft leaving and we believe that we may have lost some time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.

We were sitting on the front steps. The sun was begining to set. It was a hot summer evening. Accross the street was a corn field. A fireball about the size of beach ball appeared to be hovering over the cornfield. At first we thought it was a firework, but it never disapated. It hovered in one spot with a molten dribble coming off of it, like a sparkler. Then it would move slowly to the other end of the field. It did that a couple times, and then came to the middle of the field. It then rose up about 12 ft and then it did like a super nova and took off really fast up into the sky. We had not been drinking,,nor did we do drugs. We werent going to say anything to anyone, but then we saw in the paper that same week, that a Dekalb Police squad had collided with a similar object. It cracked the windshield and bent the antenna.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Following is an addendum/repitition, included in a second sending of the same report.

The sun was beginning to set, and it was a hot august evening. Across the street was a corn field. We were just sitting there when we saw a red/orange fireball appear over the corn field. It hovered in one place for a while and then it moved to the other end of the corn field. At first we thought it was a firework..but it didn&#39;t disapate. It just would hang there with a molten trickle coming off of it. Kind of like a sparkler does. But after going back and forth across the corn field, it came to the center and hung there for a while. And then lifted a few feet higher,,,and then got really huge,,like a nova..and then took off into the sky. It was the most amazing thing I had ever seen. We had not been drinking, nor did we do drugs. We had seen in the news later that week that a Dekalb Police officer had collided on the highway with an object fitting the same discription. It cracked his windsheild and bent his antenna. We kept it quiet all these years thinking noone would believe us.<n>

We had gone up to the house to use the restroom and were on our way back toward the stage, where the crowd was listening to Bluegrass music, when something caught my eye.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My husband was a bit tipsy, having had several beers, but I wasn’t, because I didn’t drink. When I looked up into the clear night sky, I was astonished to see a huge round object hovering over the field at about 2500 to 3000 feet above.  The sphere had multi-colored flashing lights going around its perimeter of green, yellow, white, and red and was making a very faint whirring sound. I believe the lights were moving counter clockwise, but it has been so long that I am not sure of that.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I got my husband’s attention and had him to look at it, too. He sobered up pretty quickly! The object hovered a few more seconds (approximately 15) and just as if it had seen us see it, it darted amazingly quickly away in a zigzag pattern in a due east direction.  Within 2 or 3 seconds, the object had completely disappeared with no trace. (I grew up the oldest daughter of a career Marine that taught Avionics. I had been to many Blue Angel Shows, grew up around aviation, flight simulators, etc., and I had never seen or heard of anything that could move that fast.)  As far as I know, we were the only ones to witness the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date of the event may be approximate.  PD))<n>

Hearing this tale broughts me to my knees at the dinner table trembling in tears while my wife and sone sleep the night away not knowing of an encounter I had when I was 17 years of age that I have kept silent all these years for many reasons I am sure you can understand.  I lived in an area that was a fairly quiet suberb of Painesville, ohio it was a 2mile circle of residential homes with duplexes/ town homes in the center.  A very quiet community. On the evening of august 17th, 1979, I was 17 years of age.  It was a quiet evening with clear skies.  you could see all the stars and constilations in the sky with a light breeze.  a very cool evening.  I was living with my mother and step father in a residential home on the outer circle and was walking home after playing the guitar over a freinds house trying to write lyrics for a melody we came up with.  You could hear the crickets in the field as I walk down the road.  I was a bit chilled though, . I did notice that there was absolutely no one outside of their homes all bundled in for the night and scattered far apart there were lamp posts but they were so far apart it was really still pretty dark.  I guess I was too busy trying to keep warm because i didn&#39;t wear a coat and i was running the lyrics to my song through my head to take notice that all of a sudden everything was silent.  I didn&#39;t hear the crickets anymore, i heard nothing.  dead silence and a wierd sense of being watched and all of a sudden i just stopped walking.  The first thing I did was raise my right hand and look at my wrist watch and the time was 9:37pm.  What I encountered next I really don&#39;t know how to explain but I remember looking upwards to the sky that I had just seen stars just moments earlier and I just stood in total awe trying to take in all this information in total awe of the huge amassity of this huge thing that I swear was several football fields in either direction. it was smooth and very flowing in design. it was like a huge mother ship that completely took out the sky above me in every direction.  I remember seeing a huge cylindrical shape in the center that extended down maybe eight feet taht maintained a dark red glowing hugh almost like the black out lights used in the military but it was intense yet at the same time it was not lighting up the area at all.  I also quit vividly remember hearing a very LOW EARTHLY RUMBLING SOUND VERY DEEP IN PITCH LIKE AN EARTH QUAKE BUT VERY LOW AND DEEP IN PITCH.  iT WAS AS IF IT WAS FOLLOWING ME DOWN THE ROAD JUST GLIDING ACROSS THE SKY AT A VERY SLOW SPEED THAT WOULD CAUSE ANY OTHER CRAFT TO CRASH. All of a sudden i noticed three lights begining to strobe like a strobe light blue, red and white lights and I was hit with a solid beam of pure white light.  this all happened in a matter of three minutes topps since I looked at my watch at 9:37pm.  The next thing I remember I was walking back down the road in a very calm and relaxed state as if I came out of surgery just comming off sodium pentithal.  it was just a real peaceful relaxed feeling yet It was very much over shadowed with a very strong sense of being violated and my under arms were stinging bad.  when I got home i removed my shirt to find that my under arms were both bleeding and I was missing flesh.  But I remember that when I found myself walking back down the road in a drug enduced state I remember looking back at my watch and it was exactly 10:05 pm!  approxamately 25 minutes passed that I could not account for because it only seemed to actually have taken place in a matter of three or four minutes.  To this day I have identical scar patterns under both arms and since this tramatic experience that I was put through against my will I will live with this untill the day I die.  I do know that what I saw and experienced was as real as the car I drive and the air that I breath and you are the first to know of my abduction.  I didn&#39;t ever say anything to anyone for the fear of becoming someones lab rat!  You can reach me by leaving a message on my e-mail at ((e-address deleted)).COM.  i am now 39 yrs, going on the big 40 January 7th.  I am willing to share my story to the listners on the radio show.  it was because of this show that I decided to come forward.  I do not wish to reveal my last name or address.  To this day, every night I go to bed and.  wonder what was done to me!  All I can say is that we as a people on this planet have great concern to be worried with technologies this advanced.  I was under the impression durring this ordeal that these ships as far as our technology was concerned are totally and completely untouchable, unstopable and indistructable.  We have great cause to be seriously concerned and with the increase of sightings and such close encounters which i fear are deliberate and with purpose, it  will not be far too long before we know the truth.  Do you really think they care if they are seen!  They are obviously getting bolder and bolder all the time.  You see TV shows like Star Gate.  What makes you so certain that things like this really don&#39;t exist!  They only appear to be seen when they want.  Just call me matthew be too<n>

I dropped the truck tailgate down and sat on it looking westward enjoying the quiet clear night before heading inside for good.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was just basically staring straight ahead across the road over miles of vacant land and not up into the sky.  Not too long a time went by when I spotted an object moving toward me from a mile or so away.  It was traveling parallel to the ground and not more than a few hundred feet above the ground.  It got larger, naturally, as it came closer to me.  (It did not change size. It was just getting nearer and nearer.)  I hopped down off the tailgate and stood watching it get closer and closer.  I was definitely not expecting to see what I saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This object was clear like crystal glass and spherical.  It looked like a crystalline golf ball in that its entire surface had concave circular “divets“all over it just like a golf ball.  I could see inside a black structure spanning about the center third of the sphere. The top of this black structure was probably a bit more than half the internal height of the sphere. Below the black structure was a brown structure that touched the black structure and was the same width.  It is hard to estimate the size of the sphere.  This was no star pinprick of a light in the sky.  This was probably a minimum of twenty feet in diameter and just a few hundred feet above me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I slowly raised my head up as it passed and turned my body around to follow it towards the city of Phoenix.  This sphere made not a bit of noise, and it did not cause any air turbulence.   There was no harsh or bright light emanating from it.  The inside was illuminated, (that is how I saw the black and brown structures) but no bright spot that would indicate the source of light was evident.  The outside had like a hazy light around the sphere. No separate exterior light(s), but light that must have passed from inside the crystal sphere to the outside.  It was like the haze you see around a street light at night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My eyes followed it until I could see it not more.  I ran inside and turned on the radio…no news flash, etc.  My husband was watching  tv, and there was nothing on the tv about the object. I never heard anything about it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have looked on the internet concerning spherical ufos and have found nothing similar to what I saw.  I came across this site tonight, hesitated, but then thought maybe someone else did see it  or one like it and hadn’t responded either.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was real, and makes me wonder what our government really has knowledge/ability to do.  I know what I saw, and there will never be an denying it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am 67 now and saw this when about 32 years old.  I was a school teacher at the time and just retired two years ago from 25 years of teaching mainly science at a Texas junior high/middle school.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((ADDENDUM FROM WITNESS))<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was trying to fix the event time on a report I just sent in and clicked on what ended up getting me to your home page.  I couldn&#39;t find a way back to the report to try to fix it again. The event time should have been 20:30.  It was about 8:30 at night, and I think I converted the event time incorrectly.

The weather was clear and the windwas minimal.  This Isl. is about 90 miles so.of N.Y. City, there at least two military basesrelatively close by.  There was 5 0r 6 of us sittingclose to the waterline at Beach Haven Terrace beach.  As this is a summer recreation areaand I was 19 years old at the time we were partying at the time of the sighting.  At thetime of the viewing I was not out of control perhaps slightly high but nowhere near to the point of halucinating (sorry about the spelling).<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was facing the Ocean and I was just taking in the veiw, for example I noticed some boats and ships out for an evening cruise and that the Moon illuminated the sky enoughto see the eastern horizen very clearly. At thispoint out of my left eye I saw a very bright light parallel with the horizen, using my thumb at arms length I would estimate it at 1 or 2 degrees above the clearly seen horizen. Afterabout a second or two I shouted out to the othersto look over there. All but one of us saw it(the guy with his back to the sea was&#39;nt quickenough). by the time everyone looked it startedto do a 90 degree turn over the horizen and it did not appear to slow down, the fireball&#39;slight faded over the horizen within a secondor two.  And thinking back on the moment (later on that night whenI was tring to get to sleep) I believe I saw the siloutte of a cigar shape craft in frontos the fireball. This I can not be absolutly sure since my eyes did not have enough time to focus in on any details of what ever it was.I am also aware of the fact that it seemed to be reacting to my excitementfor the 90 deg. turn accured directly striaghtout from our position, a coincidence maybe, butI wonder.  I hope you can coralate this report with someoneelse who witnessed this event,I sure some of thefolkes on board some of those ships got an evenbetter look at it since they were much closer.I&#39;m just guessing but I believe it traveled atleast 2 or so in the time it was flying strightThe fireball did not get much bigger whenit was straight out from our position on the beachwhich is as close to sea level as one can get.With the help of a math oriented person you could get a rough ideaof how far it traveled and approx. speed.By the way I realize that CLOSE ENCOUNTERS OFTHE THIRD KIND had just come out in 77 and I really did want to see a UFO but at that timein my life I just had a passing interest inthe subject.  Hope this report helps.David Mitchell<n>

The object appeared to be metallic silver in color, triangular in shape, basically flat underneath with clearly visible joints and rivets.  Also visible underneath were what appeared to be either lights or portholes lit from within.  Nothing was visible inside.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object was extremely large and appeared to be quite close.  A line of poplar trees to my left rose nearly 150’ from the ground and the object cleared them all, blocking out nearly the entire starlit sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As for speed, the object was very slow. It took seven or eight seconds to disappear from view behind a row of trees across the street.  A jet liner could not have stayed airborne at such a sedate rate of speed.  I have seen 747’s up close in flight and this object was much larger and more massive.  There was no discernable fuselage, no wings or other protruding control devices evident.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was absolute silence, as the object passed overhead; no sound whatsoever came from the ship nor did its passing disturb tree tops or leaves.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My immediate thought was that a monstrous crash was imminent, as a significant natural obstacle lay in its path and without accelerating soon, that huge ship was going to plow into Birch Mountain, immediately north of the Wenatchee River.<n> <n><n> <n><n> No crash occurred. The object, once out of my line of sight, for all intents and purposes, had simply vanished.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.

We suspect that the report is an accurate representation of what he witnesses.  The witness has provided an excellent drawing of what the craft looked like, from his vantage on the ground, and as he looked to the north.  PD))<n>

It was early evening about 20:00( 8 pm) when went out to have a smoke and watch the shooting stars over the castle to the north, the annual August meteor shower(I forget the name) It was hazy and they weren&#39;t visible so we sat batting the breeze. As I looked up into the southern sky over the inland sea I noticed a singly white light. It appeared to be some good distance away, probably several miles if it were an aircraft. At first it moved like an airplane in the distance horizontally across the sky from west to east. Then suddenly it changed direction from horizontal to a rising 60 degrees back to the west and covered a great distance that was either a rise in altitude or approach to our location. At the distance that it appeared to be a few inches of travel to us was miles of distance. It then changed direction several times moving across the sky at differing speed, sometimes fast and sometimes slow. Somestimes it just stopped entirely. When it made turns they were immediate and sometimes at very sharp angles.  After a period of time it returned to the general position where I first observed it to the south west sky, then went at a high velocity horizontal to a distance as we observed 3 - 5 feet to the east then changed direction back to the west and up at about a 30 or 45 degree angle and disappeared into or behind the rising moon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My father is retired Airforce and I have been around aircraft all my life. I worked with helicopters in North Carolina for the Marine Corps and with Fighter/Attack Jets in Iwakuni. I know what man made air craft are capable of and no aircraft ever desinged and built by humans could travel at the speeds this object did nor make the kinds of turns it made at those speeds. It had to travel at great distances in its location since it was a good ways distant from us and out over the ocean.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It could not have been one of the jets from our air station because they were grounded in the evening because at that time Japan had a no fly rule to keep the noise levels down during the night hours. To this day I have not seen anything that moved like that light nor have I been able to figure out what it was.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

We got out of the car and looked up to see a huge saucer shaped UFO that had multi colored lights under it and it was very, very low. I can&#39;t say how long we stood there in amazement... I often call that friend and talk about it.  I&#39;ve also searched websites looking for any one else who may have reported that sighting.  It took off over the Hudson and headed towards the George Washington bridge.  Three years ago, I told a friend in Boston about it and learned he lived in Queens at the time and remembers seeing it as well.  It was never in the newspaper or media.

I was located 100 ft north of highway 203 in the town of Mammoth Lakes. At approximately midnight to 0100 hr, I was looking at the stars when my attention was drawn to the sound of swirling fire. (It was similar to the sound when you swing an ignited long stick from the fire pit and swung slowly it in a circular motion). I looked to the east and saw a ball of fire rolling through the air at 500 ft off the deck. The ball was traveling at 80-100 mph from a direction from east to west and was approximately 50 ft in diameter. The object maintained its altitude neither accenting nor descending. The ball was red-orange in color very similar to a fire pit of burning wood. The ball also did not strike any hillside and I did not hear any impact after it left my view and hearing range.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Actually, the stars were out directly overhead, but the horizon was still in that twilight blue phase.  I became aware of a movement in the sky in the west horizon, moving slowly in my direction.  I sat up to get a better view, and noticed that the movement simply seemed to block out the sky where it passed . . . there were no lights of any kind.  I was able to figure the shape of the object by observing the omission of sky/stars as it moved.  It was roughly in the shape of a chevron (or boomerang), but seemed to be filled in as well, which aproximates the shape of a triangle.  It was only after a few seconds that I realized that the &#34;craft&#34; was not a distant object, but was actually VERY close.  It was flying over the neighborhood.  By the time it was over the nearest house to my backyard, I was able to estimate height,size and speed.  It was aproximately 50 feet wide, gliding silently at about the height of two telephone poles, and traveling at only 30 mph.  As it went directly over me, I heard a very faint mechanical sound, somewhat akin to squeaky wet rubber.  It was at that point that I became extremely uncomfortable-- sensing that something was defintely &#34;off&#34; in the normal scheme of things.  As the object passed out of my sight over my house, I felt the overwhelming need to run into the house, but was petrified that the &#34;thing&#34; might have landed in the front yard!  I banged on the back door, but realized that everyone was downstairs and couldn&#39;t hear.  I ran around to the front in spite of my fear, and rushed into the house.  I was trembling as I ran downstairs.  I could hardly recount what I had experienced.  Having adequately frightened my younger brothers (unintentionally . . . this time!), we locked the doors to the house, and closed the blinds (like THAT would help).  I took a scrap from a grocery bag laying on the kitchen table, and w! rote dow n everything concerning what I had seen, while it was fresh in my mind.  I have kept that scrap ever since.<n>

My first thought was that it was a helicopter, and I was wondering what idiot was flying so low! It didn&#39;t seem to move, so I looked up through the windshield of my car, but could not see anything except the light.  As I looked, the light &#39;took off&#39; to the west, and within a second or two was a pinpoint red dot, then disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The area I was in was, at the time, all rural undeveloped prairie and farmland. It was very dark, and there was no other traffic and very little artificial light in the far distance. Not until the light disappeared did I realize that there had been no sound or turbulence that might be expected of a helicopter in flight.  I don&#39;t know what it was, but I will never forget it.  I sat at the stop sign for several minutes before proceeding to my destination.<n>

It hovered above us and ran through colors like I have never seen before. It seemed to be somekind of &#34;screen&#34;. Then it went back the way that it came and that was the end of it! Once again, we heard no sound at all, and there was really no road noise to speak of.

8/1/79 22:00|Omaha|NE|Triangle|2 minutes|Multiple triangle-shaped, silver objects in night sky.|11/21/10|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/077/S77748.html|27|ndxe197908| Multiple triangle-shaped, silver objects in night sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This event occurred in the summer of 1979.  I distinctly remember that it was dark and that there was cloud cover.  My estimation is that it would have been approximately 22:00.  At the time, my family was living in the Millard community in Sarpy County, just outside of Omaha, Nebraska.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On the evening of the event, my brother and I had been allowed to stay up late, as we were waiting for our mother to return from a shopping trip.  Our house had a large picture window in the living room (facing west), and our couch was situated with its back against the window.  My brother and I had been kneeling on the couch facing backwards, allowing us to look out the picture window.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After several minutes, I noticed what appeared to be a bright object in the western sky, and that it was moving east at a high rate of speed.  As the object became closer, I noticed that it was triangular shaped and silver in color.  I also noticed that there were several similar objects, traveling in single file, all flying at the same speed and in the same direction.  Each object was flipping end-over-end, at a rate of approximately 1 flip every 2 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I previously mentioned, there was cloud cover on the evening in question.  The objects were all flying below the cloud cover.  They also appeared to be maintaining a very constant altitude, despite the fact that they were flipping.  I’d have estimated that the objects were flying at an altitude of approximately 2,500 feet and that they were roughly 150 feet in length.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The objects were silver in color and were clearly visible, yet did not appear to have any lights.  Rather, their surfaces were simply illuminated, as if the skin of each craft was its own light source.  Their flight path took them directly over our house, so I was able to get a good look at them as they flew over.  They made no sound at all, had no obvious vapor trails or exhaust and did not flash, blink or pulse any light.  The skin, however, did appear to &#34;shimmer.&#34;  The best description I could offer for this &#34;shimmering&#34; would be to take a very reflective piece of foil, crumple it into a ball, unfold and flatten the foil, then shine a flashlight at the foil, moving the light quickly across the foil’s surface.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In total, 4 of the objects passed overhead, at the rate of 1 every 15 seconds or so.  The total duration of the event, from our first noticing the objects to them passing over our house and out of view, was about 2 minutes.  That was the first and only time that we saw the objects.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))<n>

Reading one of your past reports from July 31, 2000 at 9:24 am jogged my memory and I thought I&#39;d add this to your database.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Back when I was in high school, my father and I were out in the yard one evening around 9:30, using a telescope I had recently gotten.  My dad was looking down at the the telescope, trying to adjust it, but I was looking nearly due west and about 75 degrees up from horizontal, over the top of our house.  Suddenly a very large, spherical fireball, about twice the size of a full moon, seemed to drop into the sky and roll to the west across an invisible shperical dome, then vanish as if had burned out.  That was the most amazing sight.  There was no sound, no enormous amount of light (just a soft orange color), no blast.  It seemed to all take place at extremely high altitude.  The event lasted about 1 second, but was burned into my mind.  My father never saw anything.  In my own mental analysis, it seemed to me that something had entered the atmosphere and exploded at extremely high altitude.  I figured the invisible dome I mentioned, to be the curve of the atmosphere and that the fireball just rolled off of it.  One detail I clearly recall is that the fireball had a &#34;firey&#34; texture to it, much the same as the texture seen on close-up photos of the sun.  There was no residual contrail, etc. left behind by the event.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

8/1/79 00:00|Fort Valley|GA|Sphere|10 minutes|White ball of multicolored lights left 2 foot circle burned in grass|7/5/05|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/044/S44696.html|32|ndxe197908| White ball of multicolored lights left 2 foot circle burned in grass<n> <n><n> <n><n> At the age of 5 or 6, while lying in my bed (near the meeting of highway 41 and state route 96) a star appeared to be coming closer. It was at first white, but upon arriving outside my bedroom window different colored lights were visible. It was a perfect sphere with a window and two heads visible (albeit slightly obscured by the bright light in the middle of the night - they did have eyes, but I don&#39;t remember anything else) looking out the window at me. They proceeded to &#34;speak&#34; to me, though there was no way I should logically have been able to hear them. They were calming and reassuring. I was not nervous at all. I wanted to go outside and see them, but before I could think that far they jetted into the starry sky and disappeared. At that young age I thought they must be angels and was afraid to tell anyone about my experience. The next morning I awoke and assumed it was all a dream. However, while playing outside I found a circular burn mark about 2 feet wide next to my window. The grass was burned in a perfect circle that oddly lasted for several years. I returned there about 5 years ago and the circle was gone. Thank you for listening.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of the event is approximate.  PD))<n>
