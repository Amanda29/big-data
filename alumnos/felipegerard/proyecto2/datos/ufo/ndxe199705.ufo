It must have been going VERY fast. It flew across half of the sky in about 4 seconds. It did not have a tail of ANY kind. It was just a huge ball of light. It did not look like ANY shooting star I have ever seen. It did not make any sound. I lost sight of it once it went past some trees.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Ok, I am a 17 year old teenager. I have been intersted in UFOs for years. I was in the car at a gas station when I saw a huge green fire ball or ball of light fly across half of the sky. It was VERY fast. It looked like it was a ball shape. It did not make any sound. It did not look like any shooting star I have ever seen.<n>

I always had wanted to see a UFO,have always been interested in them, now wish I wouldn&#39;t have seen it, as I&#39;ll never know what it was, or its origin. I even called Art Bell, spoke to him off the air, he mentioned on the air that &#34;? will prob go the way of most UFO sightings&#34; meaning unreported.He asked me to call Peter Davenport, he seemed to  be able to tell that I wouldn&#39;t. This is why he mentioned it when he returned to the air.<n>

We video taped the whole sequence of events about 45 min. worth.. we then contacted a local ufo group MUFON.  They came out to cover the story and file reports.  They were asounded by the lights and imedialtly, they contated people in Phoenix AZ...because the lights in Phoenix were the same lights we were seeing over NY, and they were amazed hhow accurately the lights matched those of the Phoenix lights.

5/28/97 21:00|Urubamba (outside Cusco, Peruvian Andes) (Peru)||Light|few seconds|A fast moving "body of Light" sweeps over us as we star watch in the Sacred Valley of the Incas outside Cusco Peru at an elevation of l|9/26/98|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/002/S02558.html|9|ndxe199705| Summary : A fast moving &#34;body of Light&#34; sweeps over us as we star watch in the Sacred Valley of the Incas outside Cusco Peru at an elevation of l0,000&#39;  The night was clear, cold and very dark (no moon).  The &#34;Light&#34; was seen coming from the southwest directly over a 600&#39; peak just in front of us.  It was bright white and seemed to have mass, but no structure was perceived by the two witnesses.  It was approximately a half mile in width and moving at a &#34;very high speed&#34; ...<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had been asked to build a &#34;walking meditation garden maze&#34; for a large resort in the Peruvian Andes.  Upon completion of the maze I invited the owners and a friend for a small ceremony to dedicate the Classical 7-Path Labyrinth to the healing and well being of our planet Earth.  It was the last few days of late May around 9pm in the evening on a star lit clear night, no moon.  Following the short dedication ceremony the four of us stood watching the heavens, Maria del Carmen and I faced the sacred mountain &#34;Yawar Maki&#34; which juts up from the Urubamba river a few feet from where we stood.  She and I were looking up over the peak at the Southern Cross when suddenly a &#34;large body&#34; of fast moving light sped directly over our heads.  In fact both of us almost fell backwards as we followed the light with our heads craning backwards.  Across the sky overhead it moved and then just disappeared into thin air.  The two men were looking in the other direction and by the time they hea! rd our squeals and looked in our direction, the body of light has completely disappeared.  The entire event took not more than a matter of seconds.  This was neither airplane or lightning, this we know, what is was through is still to be known.  The creation of this particular Labyrinth is as a healing center for tourists and pilgrims visiting the ancient sacred sites in this area of the Andes.  In myth and folklore, the Labyrinth traditions tell of many unusual stories such as that of Scandinavian sailors who would use the labyrinth in a form of sympathetic magic to control the weather.  It is also energetically linked with the seven major energy centers in the bodies auric field, the tones on the scale, and the 7 primary colors in the rainbow.  Unusual phenomena has been recounted in relation to the labyrinth for the past 3,500 years and in fact the act of walking a labyrinth still seems to draw transformative events to the practitioner.  I and maria del Carman both feel thi! s ususal &#34;event&#34; and our walking and dedication somehow are united.  I have never seen a UFO but I came away from this experience feeling like I had seen something I could not explain by conventional terms.  Both Maria del Carmen and her husband, a famous British journalist recounted several sightings during the past year and a half they&#39;ve owned the hotel and lived in this part of the Andes.  They tell me these type stories are common and knowledge of &#34;craft&#34; is widespread and seen by many.  In fact, a lake just over the peak we had stood in front of  called &#34;Chequerec&#34; is known locally as the &#34;UFO Lake&#34; and for the past l00 years (and probably more) stories have been told of craft coming and going from the lake and tales of &#34;little green men&#34; etc.  After this experience I asked around to the native people, the Quechua.  Everyone had a story which was usually told in a matter of fact demeanor as something as natural as the sun coming up each day. Another Indian friend that I ! would describe as being educated, soft-spoken and extremely low profile, and who&#39;d lived many years at the ancient site of Machu Picchu recounted a story.  He claims to have seen up to l7 &#34;ships&#34; on one night last November 1996.  As he told it, he was guiding an American woman into the sacred ruins late after midnight (which is allowed with special permission) when they both witnessed a litany of unusual &#34;lights&#34; above and around the old city.  He said he&#39;s not seen anything of this nature in the past  seven years, and believed that they&#39;d (the star people) returned.  This site has been known in local lore to be a place of intense UFO phenomena throughout the ages.<n>

Anyway something happened and I knew it wasn&#39;t a sattelite because it very quickly zipped through the sky making 90 degree angle turns then it shot off through the sky out of sight. we brought the tape inside and axamined it many times,studying it&#39;s movements.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So now i&#39;ll let you think what you want to but back to the imaginatoin thing if you think that when you see something that it,s not realy there ad you can&#39;t trust your mind in knowing it&#39;s there then how do you know anything?<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date may be approximate.

Over the years I have observed northern lights, meteors, satellites and all kinds of commercial and private aircraft.  Rarely have I seen anything out of the usual until the evening of Tue. May 27, 1997.  Because of engineering studies at university I haven&#39;t had time until now to send in this report. What got me interested in getting in touch with the UFO Center was hearing Peter Davenport on the Coast-to-Coast AM radio program on Sat. Feb. 20, 1999 at 1:30 am EST.  I wasn&#39;t aware of the UFO reporting center website until that morning.  He had mentioned that some people had reported seeing a large diamond shaped object.  This is something like what I saw. I spotted a brightly lit yellowish orange four-sided diamond shaped object over Welland, Ontario, Canada.  It had well defined edges with the light being more concentrated near its edges.  It approached from the northwest below the Big Dipper at 11:05 pm EDT with no sound.  Its size was about a thumbnail&#39;s width at arm&#39;s length.  In view for about 15 seconds, it moved across the sky in a straight line and disappeared below the southeast horizon. An estimated altitude was 40,000 feet which gives an approximate width (using trigonometry) of 800 feet across its beam.  In addition, this object moved with its larger interior angles being front to back. I again saw the same object (at least it appeared the same) a week later on Tue. June 3, 1997 at 11:50 pm EDT over Welland and its behaviour was the same as that described above. This eerie looking object was certainly something different as it was too large for a satellite, shuttle-craft or the Mir station, and it was moving extremely fast for its estimated height above ground.  It also didn&#39;t have the characteristic port and starboard red and green lights nor the flashing white or red strobe lights associated with known aircraft. I hope that this information will be of interest to you and that it can be used in collaboration with other reported similar sightings.<n>

After 30 seconds or so, the two craft silently dissapeared into the sky.<n>

In 1979 I was holiday ing at a place called Berowra waters on the South coast near Sussex Inlet with five friends&#39; one of whose father owned the caravan park where we stayed.This caravan park is on a cliff overlooking the pacific ocean and we would go to the beach everyday and spend most of the day their swimming, surfing and sunbaking.On this particular day I was standing on the shore with my friends father and mother who owned the caravan park when we looked towards the water facing south-east on a clear hot day( no clouds) and observed a black metallic mass that looked similar to an aircraft carrier on its side (approx length 1500ft long-200-400ft across) and slowly moving towards a cliff face which eventually hid most of the object but not before we discussed what it was and how something that big could stay airbo rne when it was apparently moving so slowly and not making a sound.The object was approx: less than three miles away travelling at two to five miles an hour and started to slowly move in a westerly direction over land, it seemed to take so long to move out of view that other people on the beach had by this time noticed what we were looking at and started to point in the air and their was approx ten to twenty people who saw the same thing up and down the beach.As owner of the caravan park numerous people asked them what it was and they responded that they didn’t know, only that their was a Navy facility further down the coast, and Airforce Base at Nowra (ALBATROSS)The object (and it was a metal object)stayed in view for over half an hour from the time we first noticed it until it was lost behind the cliff face. We then proceed to climb the cliff to see if it could still be seen and their it was hovering for a considerable amount of time until a helicopter &amp; jet could be heard in the vicinity, and it slowly moved away, but not taking any notice of either helicopter or jet.In the meantime the southcoast radio station had been inundated with phone calls about strange bright white craft (and they did say craft, I was listening to the broadcast to see if anyone had reported what we had seen earlier) people described the objects, and up to ten were seen, as flying up and down the coast in pairs and one at a time, out to sea, and close to land, as being as bright as the sun, and reflecting the sun, and travelling very fast and occasionally turning back towards the way they had come. When I heard this I remember thinking that this was not what we had seen as the objects were to small, (the size of a houses I seem to remember) not the size of an aircraft carrier as we had seen a few hours earlier. The reports on the radio were the same day, only hours apart from our encounter.My impression was that this was a controlled event as this was winter holidays and the weather was so beautiful that thousands of people were at the beaches up and down the coast, the two people who were with me, and, owned the caravan park were well known in the area ,he was on the local council and had lived in the area all of there lives, and even had a street named after them, and were very honest and humble people who had never seen anything like it in their life, they were also aware of the military bases locally and had seen experimental aircraft before fly over the region, including Jets. I was seventeen at the time I am now thirty five and this was a very close sighting of a very immense object that moved extremely slow and showed no signs of external movement, but it had what appeared to be rivets or welding on the bottom on the side which faced us.At the time I really thought that this was not anything which had been manufactured in Australia and never once thought this was from outer space, now I’m not so sure.Conclusion : Large black mass the size of an aircraft carrier: Moved slowly without sound: Stayed in view for a considerable amount of time: Was seen by numerous people: Weather was hot and cloudless: Other objects were also seen: Radio station reported strange craft seen up and down the coast: Object and smaller objects made of solid material: Reported to authorities: Was highly unusual<n> <n><n> <n><n> The Next time (also 1979)In the same year a few friends of mine decided to go to a lookout near Baulkham Hills  in the west of Sydney which was about to become a new suburb, the time was approximately 7.00 - 8.30 PM in summer, (daylight saving ) late November and was a clear night with no clouds, we had been their for a short time when I noticed three circular bright red lights moving south (coming from a northerly direction) in a controlled movement, they were approximately less than five miles away and at that distance appeared to be quite large, about the size of a average house and were moving in a orderly fashion and in no hurry, they were moving in a triangular motion, travelling about 3-10 miles an hour.They did no abrupt moves and stayed in the same formation for a long time (20-30min) before they seemed to reach a point near Prospect Reservoir, and one dived towards the ground at a tremendous speed, one left skyward at high speed, and the other one just seemed to dissolve into the night. We turned the radio on and 2WS, which is a local radio station reported that they had received phone calls from people asking what the lights could be.I asked one of my friends who was there, recently, did he remember that particular night and he described the exact things I have just explained, and he said that they seemed to be under some kind of control and maybe connected to each other as they did a peculiar pattern as they moved across the sky, but the same pattern right across the sky.Conclusion : Three Bright Red Lights with some kind of shape (circular): In a fixed formation (triangular): Seen by five people for a period of at least 20 min: Was reported on the radio by others, independent people: Disappeared  within seconds of each other: Cloudless viewing.Eleven Years Later (1990)I had just returned from Florida, in the States, earlier in the year and had recently lost my job and found myself with time on my hands so I decided to be involved in this new craze which was sweeping the globe 3D images.I managed to find a job in the city (Sydney, Australia) and was working selling 3D posters at Central Railway Station, literally. This was around Christmas 1990 and they were very popular, on this particular day which was a Monday I was just about to go to lunch when a rather tall gentleman of about 6ft 10in, tall, and with large features, long White hair and looking very much like an American Indian, remarked to me that his friend thought  that the brain was similar to a 3D image and the universal acceptance of these images had some kind of lost meaning which we were about to grasp again after a very long time.He then brought up the subject of his friend who had worked for NASA as a photographer and had a very high clearance in the military and had been asked to photograph the inside and outside of a Circular craft which had somehow come into the possession of NASA. He told me in no uncertain terms that his friend took photos of the objects door and as he moved inside and looked  back towards the outside that the door was now twenty to thirty feet higher and the inside was of immense size, yet from the outside the door and craft were rather small, he also me about the underground  nuclear test explosion which was apparently detonated to contain alien forces who had Killed up to 25 scientists and 44 military elite who had complained of human abductions, we had talked so long that I missed my lunch break, and I was working 12 hour days so what he had been telling me had taken nearly one hour, a friend of mine who had come into to see me stood their for the whole time and told me after!wards that what he had just said was really over the top but very interesting.The next day a Tuesday I was sitting in the top floor of a double decker train at 6.30 in the morning on my way to work, the train had just left Strathfield station when I noticed in the distance, a shape like a plane that seemed to be banking towards the train, I was looking for markings and wings as I thought it was a plane making a turn towards the airport when it suddenly approached parallel to the train and proceeded to pace the train.Most people who were on the train were asleep and I had an urge to wake them and say look out the window at this silvery disk shaped object which had by now slowed considerably and was now only one mile away and slowing down as we slowed down as we approached the next stop, the train had just slowed down for track maintenance when I noticed a tower between the object and the train, by the time we passed the tower which was about thirty feet across, the object had disappeared from view, as if someone had turned a switch and the object had just disappearedConclusion   : Strange encounter with person with Indian like appearance: Told me about something which I had heard years earlier underground: Observed a craft of no known origin the next day: Had seen it disappear before my eyes on a clear day: Was definitely metallic and polished silver - reflected the early morning sunlight: Had no markings whatsoever: No exhaust or smoke at all: Was seen for 10-15 minIn early (1993)Near the middle of April I was at a friends place in Blacktown ( 25 miles West of Sydney) we had just been outside and had seen a bright red object shining in a westerly direction at a very high altitude and not doing the normal flight you would expect from any aircraft, this lasted about five minutes before we lost it behind a tree, there were three of us, at about one hour after this I decided to go home, the time was about 10-11 PM.I lived about three miles away and on the way home had a Incredible encounter with multiple craft over Blacktown (where I live) it started when I reached the top of a hill on Locke St and was stopped at a set of traffic lights and noticed directly ahead less than a mile away a Huge Object, and smaller craft above the main one, the lights changed and I proceeded down the hill past the local hospital, and as I rounded the corner I couldn’t believe what I was seeing, their above the road less than five -hundred feet away I saw two objects- One, the bigger of the two had lights of different shades and colours which moved around the base and middle in a fast movement so that the lights seemed to catch up with each other and I could see what seemed to be railings inside the craft, the lights which were luminous colours-Green-washed in purples and yellows with a touch of Blue. There seemed to be a bright light coming from inside the large object.The object above the larger one had to be large also but wasn’t doing anything other than sitting above the other one, I slowed down at another set of lights and saw a elderly gentleman who was walking along the footpath and I was going to wind down my window and ask him to look up at the Objects but thought  he might have a heart attack so I didn’t say anything, while I was waiting for the lights to change they started to slowly move away over the hospital and I thought to myself that I was going to chase them ( the objects) at that very second as if they had heard what I had thought they accelerated to a brisk pace and I turned around and started to chase them, as I drove up the hill and turned east down Bungarribee Rd I stopped my car which overlooked a disused quarry and got out I notice two more objects hovering above my head at no more than 200ft above me, I then looked East and about half a mile away noticed another two cigar shaped objects the same as the ones above my!head, I then looked to the south and saw another object similar to the one above the large object that I was chasing and saw the two craft I was chasing moving at a slow speed in a south-easterly direction, in the direction of Bankstown Airport about fifteen miles away.While I was watching them both move away the two above me were still there not moving at all, I was out of the car and could almost touch them, they made no sound and seemed to just hover without any wobbling or movement, I continued to watch all seven objects for the next hour or so until the first two disappeared in the vicinity of Sydney and seemed to be moving in a large arc around the panoramic view I had (that is moving from south to east to nth east before I lost sight of them) I then noticed that the two smaller cigar shaped objects to the east had come down a bit lower and were near a radio tower 2WS and soon they too had mysteriously vanished, the objects above my head had begun to move away slowly and I saw that they were staying close together and moved slowly towards the horizon until they too had disappeared.I decided to go home and ring up the airport where I had seen the original two craft head towards, when I arrived home I had to move my mothers car under the carport, but, when I tried to start the car it wouldn’t start, I finally gave up and got out of the car and looked up at the sky and the first craft I had seen with the revolving lights was directly above our house and was moving very slowly south back towards the location that I had first seen it, It was the same craft except I now had a better look at the whole Object, It was Large about 200ft in diameter and when I looked up was moving quite slowly almost as if it was waiting for something to catch it up. It then moved out of site and I went inside and rang up the airport who rang me three days later and asked me what I had seen and told me to ring the Airforce base at Richmond which I did and the person I talked to said that they had heard nothing about what I had just described.I left a message for my mother that her car wouldn’t start and she rang the NRMA which is road service in New South Wales and when he turned up the car wouldn’t start straight away and he said that it was a flat battery even though it was a new battery and the car had been driven less than four hours earlier that night.Conclusion   : Seven Objects seen in the space of a few hundred feet from each other: Coloured Lights seen emitting from around the Largest Object: Objects seen to Hover from a close distance: Seemed to hear what I was thinking: Some kind of railing seen inside large object: Bright White Light seen emitting from inside: Travelled right around the Metropolitan area: Somehow drained the power from the battery of car: Seen directly over my house so object had to of flown in a 360 deg arc around Sydney and surrounding areas: I had chased the first two objects which had been hovering over road near the HospitalBedroom Visitors 1994I had just arrived home from a friends place and was lying on the bed looking at the ceiling and looking out the window at the stars when I felt a sharp pain like a pin being stuck in my toes, the first thing I thought was that a white tailed spider had bitten me as there was an increase in these type of spiders around the house at the time.I felt like I was frozen and wanted to yell out but didn’t want to disturb my mother who was asleep in the other room, I was wide awake and had only just put my head on the pillow seconds earlier thinking about tomorrow and things I had to do, when I felt the presence in my room and sounds from the foot of my bed, I couldn’t see anything, and I still couldn’t move at all and it was then that I felt hands around my feet where the pin prick had been and I could only lift my head slightly and I saw five small figures looking at me at the foot of the bed (they had came out of my wardrobe) and I could see that the wall where the wardrobe was now different and looked like the inside of a giant hanger which went back into the wall a considerable distance.There were two small entities standing at the end of my bed and one had stuck me with a needle in the toe and one was holding my ankle and examining my ankle area, while this was happening I thought that I hope my mother in the next room doesn’t wake up and disturbs these entities as they might panic and hurt her, or she might panic and something bad might happen to her, then what seemed like a few seconds I noticed three more figures coming out of the wardrobe and stand at the foot of the bed and proceeded to stick something in my leg, I started to feel able to move again, only slightly and lifted my head off the pillow and saw right into their faces and they looked back with curious looks on their faces but never stopped doing whatever they were doing but they knew I was looking straight at them and I was wide awake.They were not trying to intentionally hurt me and I felt no fear and I could remember everything that they were doing and I was aware of  being awake and this was not a dream, I tried to communicate with them, I couldn’t talk, as no sounds came from my mouth, but I could hear my voice from deep down from within.They were quite solid, long arms but not abnormal, smallish heads not extremely large, more like small children feeling around, playing, around 3-4ft tall, dark greyish in appearance with lizard like scales, and the skin seemed the same colour throughout the body as far as I could see, and I could see just below their knees, they had a almost sad look about them and there was definitely some kind of rank as one or two ordered the others around, not with words or telepathy but they just seemed to obey without answering, and these other two stayed in the background moving around the room and observing, occasionally looking over to see what was happening.They still had hold of my ankle and reminded me of well trained doctors with nurses helping them, this was a real event, on one occasion one stepped back into the wardrobe to retrieve something and came back with it in its hand and I noticed that it had three large type fingers that seemed to be too large to do anything intricate yet here they were doing things to me with the skill of a surgeon, I felt no pain except for the initial discomfort of a pinprick in my toe, I heard no voices only muffled sounds and yet I could tell that this wasn’t going to be a adverse experience.They wanted to look at my legs and feet and didn’t come near my face or touch any part of me except my toes and ankles, although they had direct contact with my eyes. They seemed to me to be quite aware of my feelings and as they continued  they would look my way to see if I was in any discomfort and all looked when I thought of my mother, before they left I noticed they looked back at me as they went back into the wardrobe, one at a time, in a very orderly fashion, and the last thing before they vanished the wall came back to its original distance and the hanger like area which reminded me of inside a large ship gradually disappeared in a cloud like vapour.It was then that I felt the sensation of my foot and toe and I immediately jumped up and went to the bathroom and looked in the mirror and could see that I was wide awake and when I checked the time it was less than three minutes since I had arrived home, which was impossible as I had made something to eat when I first arrived home.It was then when I heard my mother talk that I realised it was all over and I have since sold the wardrobe and painted the room and had a inbuilt wardrobe installed.Later in the week I went to a friend who has a paranormal interest and he took out of my toe a small black object that wasas hard as a needle and was giving me quite a bit of pain.Conclusion : Five Entities in my bedroom: A small metal as hard as a needle was found in my toe: I was wide awake the whole time: There was eye contact and concern on their part: I saw a kind of entrance to another dimension: Some type of medical procedure had happened: Two entities in charge of procedures: Grey in appearance with skin that was like a mold: They knew what to do and had me paralysed from the neck down.: They also had a sad look- the kind of look when you say goodbye to someone you have feelings for<n> <n><n> <n><n> Early (1996)I had just came home and was going inside to  get my telescope to look at Jupiter and the Moon when I looked west and saw a fast moving object which I thought was a white aeroplane that looked like a wireframe, until I saw a smaller object either come out of the original object or came up alongside and seemed to refuel while all the time the other object was moving at a incredible speed. They stayed together for approximately 15 seconds which was a long time considering it travelled across the horizon and out of sight in that time.I rang Bankstown Airport and they told me to ring Richmond Airforce Base which I immediately did and was put through to the officer in charge of aircraft dispatches who told me that no planes would refuel over residential areas Ever and especially not at night. I know what I saw and that was a low, very high speed object with a smaller object that was seen to pace and be refuelled in mid air at about 11PM at night earlier this year 1996.Conclusion : High speed Object wireframe in appearance: Smaller Object seen to pace and be refuelled by larger object: In view for a short amount of time: Incredible speeds for both craft: Large Craft was white in appearance: Smaller Craft seemed to be see through.JUNE LONG WEEKEND (9/6/96)Sun: Time: 9.25-9.55This happened on Sun long weekend of June this year I had just dropped Lloyd who is a friend of mine at his place and he was taking his things inside when I noticed three orange/red/yellow lights pulsating and slowly moving high in the sky above Blacktown. They were in a large Triangular shape from three to five files apart, the top light of the triangle stayed in a constant spot as did the bottom left light, the light on the bottom right though moved away and pulsated in and out and disappeared on occasions and then reappeared slowly moving away from the other two until it completely disappeared from view. The other two started to slowly move away with the bottom left light going higher and the top light moving across and over the bottom light, moving east and moving very slowly, the other light moved away at the same speed going north-east and very slowly. We decided to ring a few friends who have cameras and videos and after a good half hour with the objects still in sight !I decided to go home as it was getting quite cold. We were looking through high powered binoculars and their appeared to be a solid object behind the light. As I drove home which is about two miles away I could see the remaining lights from the car quite clearly and thought that when I arrive home I would have a look through the telescope. When I arrived at my house both objects could still be seen very easily by the naked eye and through the telescope I could see that their was a light in the centre of the mass which was causing the brightness, I watched both for a considerable time until the light that was moving slowly to the north-east had stopped and had taken on the appearance of a star and was now acting as though it was stationary so I turned my attention to the other light which was now over the Windsor area travelling north-west but was still in sight for a considerable time before it was just a blur and by which time it was  icy cold, I turned the telescope again to!wards the first light and it was just sitting there stationary as a star would look, I then went to bed and when I went to work the next day I asked Lloyd if they took any pictures and he proceeded to tell me what happened later that night in front of at least seven people.After I left his friends turned up but the objects had been gone for a while before they turned up, so they went to another friends place just around the corner and this is three different accounts of what happened next starting with:<n>

It then disapeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Well my friends, Topher, Sean and I (Jusin),were traveling back from Waco on highway 56 at about 12:30 when we saw a strange object hovering about 1000 feet in the air obove a field by the highway. It was (frome the positioning of the lights) a triangle shaped object. At first we thought it was a plane but then we realized it was hovering. It had about 5 white lights, and 3 red lights, and one light that seemed to revolve around the craft. we could not tell the size but I don&#39;t think it was too big. About the size of a normal air craft. We pulled over to get a better look at it. It stayed put for about three full minutes untill we got out of the car. When we got out of the car, it started to move, slowly at first, then quite rapidly, untill lightning brightened up the sky and it disapeared. I was starting to get stormy. We looked for it for another two or three minutes but couldn&#39;t see it. We sat there for a few minutes in awe and asked ourselves if we really saw anything at all, we each said yes. We went home.((Name deleted)) is 17 years old, he is joining the Army.He just graduated from Highschool at Clifton.He is a skater (skateboard) and has a girlfriend.

I saw a saucer metal shaped object, a metal I&#39;ve never seen before, hovering in the sky, above the falls. It seemed to stand still, but shined bright from the reflection of the sun. As a group of trees hid the object for two seconds, I came back into a clearing and it had vanished. The object was brillant. It was in two sections. The shape was of a saucer. It was big. I never saw such a sight in my life. I new it was not of this world.<n>

I have to tell you I went in the house and got my 35mm and got a picture(misplaced at this moment)but we had this real strong earge to go inside...even though is was a warm evening maybe using em weapons?? I don&#39;t know. I know this is just one more of many as I recall the phoenix lights were as the same time.<n>

I looked up and observed a rapid moving single white light. It ziged and zaged, and it moved faster than anything I have ever seen. I asked my friend if he was seeing it to(because my friend had 15 years in the Air Force, I figured if it was a plain, he would know), and he replied &#34;Yeah, what the hell was it&#34;. It was on a fairly well traveled road. The light continued to zig and zag for about a minute.<n>

I am not sure of the actual date but it was Memorial Day Weekend 1997. I did not actually see an object so to speak. There were just several pulses of greenish/blue light, one right after the other for several minutes. Followed by a short break of a couple of minutes then another series but not as many as the first. Lighting the sky in a northenly direction, mainly reflecting off some scattered clouds. There was no lightning activity on this night nor enough cloud cover to produce any, and they were not white. I would estimate they were traveling between Yosemite(approx.) and Lassen(approx.) in less than a second. Faster than one could imagine. I wasn&#39;t counting but I would have to say there were about 20-30 in all. I would not rule out experimental aircraft, which I feel is the most likely scenario in this case. I have my eyes checked regularly and still have 20/15 or better vision. I was not drinking or under the influence of anything. I do believe our government does not tell us everything they know and are working on. I dont care if anyone believes me or not, I am just stepping up to share with those who have seen things that they themselves cannot identify. To sum this up,I have never seen anything like it and will never forget it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous.  PD))<n>

Even closer it had the shape of a hand glider going 30 mph at 300&#39;(2.5 trees high). crossed the back yard about 5 houses down, distance 4 or 5 stone throws away.

Must have been enormous.  Biggest and most unusual thing I have ever seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am writing about a &#34;phenomenon&#34; that I witnessed that was unlike anything I&#39;ve ever seenbefore, so I guess it would fall under the description of a &#34;UFO&#34;. As a scientist with areasonable understanding of astronomy and meteorology, and with an equally good knowledgeof aircraft (both military and civilian), I can safely say that what my colleague and I witnessedwas something that I&#39;m sure would not fall into most of the easily explainable categories. On aclear night during the Memorial Day weekend (24th of May), I saw something that lookedabsolutely enormous moving across the sky in a westerly direction. Since all I could see werethe lights to this thing (very bright white lights), I couldn&#39;t make out the shape precisely.What was even more puzzling was that the lights seemed to move, ever so slightly, withrespect to each other, but it was definitely not a &#34;formation&#34; of any kind of aircraft like I hadever seen. Although I couldn&#39;t guage the exact size of the object since I didn&#39;t know whataltitude it was at (although I would guess it was pretty high), it appeared to be bigger thananything I&#39;ve ever seen flying before, maybe several times the size of a jumbo jet. There wasabsolutely no noise and it seemed to be moving very slowly. We were on a little stretch ofroad between Lake Tahoe and Interstate 80 and there were a lot of stars out, so I&#39;d be reallysurprized if others in the Lake Tahoe area didn&#39;t spot these strange lights, also. Have youreceived any reports of sightings like this in this part of the country? Because of my job, I amhesitant to &#34;go public&#34; with this kind of information, so I would appreciate it if you didn&#39;tpublish my name or email address. Please let me know if anyone is aware of any really strangemilitary exercises going on in this area.<n>

It was blinking slower than an aircraft strobe light so I know that it was&#39;nt any type of airplane, especially because there was no visible wings or fuselage.

It seemed to be only a couple of feet in diameter, with no discernable shape. Throughout the entire sighting it kept at the exact same distance on the other side of the Interstate heading towards the oncoming traffic, even after we went over a hill it still was behind us. It was blinking slower than an aircraft strobe light so I know that it was&#39;nt any type of airplane, especially because there was no visible wings or fuselage.

We pulled into the parking lot of a local school and exited our vehicle to get a better observation.  What we saw appeared to be not one but a &#34;tight&#34; group of perhaps 10-15 extremely bright red lights in the shape of a flat triangle or &#34;delta&#34; at about 330 degrees (looking towards the Big Dipper constellation).  The objects semed perfectly motionless and emitted a constant bright reddish glow.  We observed no blinking of the lights, nor any other lights of another color (such as white aircraft lights).  After approximately 4-5 minutes of observing these objects, they appeared to suddenly dim and then suddenly disappeared from sight as if they lifted vertically at an extremely high rate of speed.  We heard no particular !sounds during this event.   We then returned home and shortly thereafter telephoned NUFORC to report the event as aforesaid.   We have not previously observed such an event as this and are very &#34;impressed&#34; at whatever our sighting was.   We have since accesses the NUFORC web site and have noticed very similar sightings in North America in the recent past.  We would be pleased to further discuss our sighting with NUFORC.<n>

I was flying out on an airplane at 6 am, ready to leave. I saw a ball of light out the windown and thought it was an airplane going over. I kept watching it, just observing it. The ball of light came toward me, getting bigger and bigger. I kept watching it. There was no noise. It kept getting bigger till it was about 7 or 8 feet across and at that point I realized it could not be an airplane. I was very afraid so I ran out of my room down to another part of the building I was staying in.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I went back to the room about an hour later and of course it was gone, sun was coming up.  It was a clear day, no storms.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I went to shut to curtains (the view looks out at the trees that partially block the main street) when I heard a strange sound.  It almost sounded like a fire engine or a police siren, but the sound seemed all wrong.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was like there was extra noise and a few different pitches.  So I looked to see what it was.  The noise got louder and finally there was a thing speeding down the road, only it wasn&#39;t touching the ground.  The trees between the house and the road were birch and spruce, so I could kind of see what the thing was.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was very large, very tall - my guess is between 40&#39;-50&#39; in height.  It had white/yellow and red lights.   It was moving extremely fast...close to 80 or 90 mph.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The road that my parents live off of, Peede Rd, is a mile long.  Vincent Ct, the road my parents live on, is very close to the end of Peede Rd.  You can&#39;t take the corner too fast because it&#39;s sharp.   I timed the time that it takes for me to run out to Peede.  It took 27 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After seeing this thing zoom by, I ran out to Peede Rd.  I figured that it was a fire truck since it had been so large, but when I got out to the road I saw nothing.  There were no vehicles on the road, no people, nothing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of sighting is approximate.  PD))<n>

I was so impressed that I retained notes of these occurences.  Both occured on the same evening; one location was at the Glendale Galleria in Glendale, California as I was driving home from the mall; there were 4 oval shaped items and white/bright in color.  The second incident was on the way home transitioning from the #134 freeway to the #2 freeway; this item was shaped like an eclipse and purple/violet in color. I heard from the news that several other people noticed the same thing and apparently there was a citing from New York as well.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I have video documentation of both sightings.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was breast feeding my 4 month old daughter, sitting in a chair facing our large picture window, (north) there were no lights on in the house.  I noticed A strange ball of light suspended in the sky. (We lived in the country, no neighbors or city lights for many, many, many miles). As I stared into the sky I saw the object change from one large bright white ball of light into two balls of light.  The &#34;lights&#34; changed in size, density and color, from bright white into a pinkish/orange hue that would become opaque, over and over and over.  The objects rejoined and it began to move in a jerky, zig zag motion, then it stopped and hovered, over and over it did this. I kept telling myself that I was seeing things... and, that my eyes were &#34;doing&#34; this. I grabbed the video recorder and began filming.  During the six minutes of filming the &#34;other&#34; or &#34;another&#34; object amazingly bright and oblong shaped streaked across the sky right above the object I was filming, it was not a falling star, either! It was un-nerving and scared me terribly. So I quickly picked up my baby and ran into my bedroom!  After putting my baby in her layette, I layed down in bed, a minute later I decided that I needed to view the tape I just shot, I think to &#34;prove&#34; to myself I just what I saw!  Well, it wasn&#39;t my eyes playing tricks on me...there it all was on tape, but this part of the tape, where I filmed the &#34;objects&#34; were full of static.  (We had filmed in total darkness before and never had static in the film. So I did another dark sky &#34;test&#34; and taped the night sky in the back yard. The playback on this contained no static which  makes me believe that the object created the static).<n> <n><n> <n><n> It should also be noted that my 7 yr. old dog, Sassie, 1/2 wolf 1/2 german shepard, was with me the entire time this was going on. She became very agitated and nervous, panting and drooling.  (the only time she ever acted close to this was 15 minutes before a hot air balloon came into our view--her senses could pick them up miles away--and her behavior was never as amplified as it was with the UFO).  After all this happened, including the &#34;sighting&#34; the following morning, 05/20/03. (that sightings explanation will follow herein), Sassie would not leave my side, she was afraid and could no longer be left in the house alone because she would try to get out, by chewing, digging or whatever.  The next morning I left for a quick run to the local party store, I was gone maybe 20 minutes, during that time frame Sassie had dug all of the flooring away from our sliding glass door, my refrigerator which was next to the slider, was moved out from the wall on an angle and the vertical blinds were in shreds. Her front paws were a bloody mess!  I left her one other time after this and Sassie had chewed all of the trim from around a window, chewed the wood around one of the panes of glass, and broke through glass jumping out of the window. She was shaking in the yard when I returned from that brief errand.  That is when I truly &#34;put two and two together&#34; so to speak, connecting the sightings with her change in personality; a once easy going, relaxed, confident dog,was screwed fearful of being left alone in the house, something we had done with her for 7 years without incident prior!  It broke my heart because she was never the same after all of this.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Well, breastfed babies are pretty consistent in their feeding times, so the following morning at 12:15 AM, I again, was sitting in the living room chair looking out of the picture window breast feeding my baby.  Sassy, my dog, began pacing the room, panting and drooling, she was whining and nervous, and I could not calm her.  At 12:29 AM, to my amazement, the &#34;object&#34; from the night before reappeared in the sky.  (I know now that my dog, Sassy knew it was coming, even though we couldn&#39;t see it yet). I grabbed my video recorder right away and ran outside and started filming.  Again, this will sound strange, I know, but, I truly felt that the object knew I was filming because it started &#34;performing&#34; for me.  This night it would change it&#39;s shape from a large, bright ball of white light into a small ball of bright light, and, again, it would change in color from bright white to pinkish/orange.  After a four minutes of filming, and, this is going to sound really wierd, all of a sudden there seemed to be an darkish shadowey type of eye looking back into my eye that was on the video camera&#39;s eye piece! I felt like the object was coming closer and closer to me,too, I got very afraid and ran back into the house and to my bedroom.  I stayed there the rest of the night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Both of these nights there were no clouds whatsoever in the sky.  These objects appeared over hundreds and hundreds of acres of nothing but farm land.  The only thing out that way is a unmaned powering station owned by Consumer&#39;s Energy Company.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I found a video expert who made 2 copies of my video for me, which I have placed in other secure locations, as well as made me photos of several video frames that he froze.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After seeing the object two consecutive nights like I did, I rearranged my living room and never looked out into the sky that way again...I was too scared to even look into the night sky for months after this for fear that I would see &#34;it&#34; again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Please know that I have filmed the area of the sighting during broad daylight, too, and retained copies of the weather reports for those days of the sighting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I would be happy to forward a copy of my tape, a map of the area and copies of my photos if it&#39;s desired.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thank you for time and if you have any insight or explanations to what I saw, it would be appreciated.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Sincerely,  ((name deleted))<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We will contact the witness and request a copy of the tape.  PD))<n>

Then I thought it was a comet because it was moving. Then it stoped and then continued again. It appered like it was folling me and my dad, in our car. I keep looking at it trying to make out what it was, i was not able to. Then it started to flash colors yellow,blue,red,green.... I was about ready to tell my dad to look at it, but as soon as my first word came out. It flew away as fast as lighting. Now i know a lot about science and such.

So I ask why. He replied that he and my sister in law had seen a fling triangle on Sunday evening may 18th while standing in our church parking lot. I asked him to draw a picture of what he saw and he did. Which fit perfectly with what I understand them to look like. I don&#39;t think he has ever seen a picture of a flying triangle so I feel his report is completely truthful. He has seen saucer type crafts in photos, but not triangles. His description is as follows. It was a perfect triangle with lights on each side. The drawing showed 5 lights per side where the end light would be counted on both sides.  12 lights total. He said its was about 1 inch long and moved much faster than any plane. The location was out in the country away from any small towns. It was on route 443 at the Appleby RD intersection. About 7 miles northeast of Harrisburg pa. And 4 miles north of Grant!ville pa. I will attempt to confirm the report with my sister in law on Monday. Until then.<n>

In short, this whatever it was, was silent, in what seemed to be in the shape of a triangle, with one light in the front and two lights on the side. It came fast and left fast all within maybe 5 minutes. It hovered right behind my car almost over my car with no lights. It was so close to my car I mean maybe 5 feet or closer then dissappeared completely.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was driving back home to Utah from Las Vegas with my friend in the middle of the night. She fell asleep, I noticed some lights quite a bit away in my rear view mirror, it looked like maybe lights from trucks, I wasnt concerned until I looked again and they were closer. It seemed that whatever it was, was approaching fast so I decided to go a little faster. It was pretty much flat land and I could see for a long distance, there was no other vehicles on the road. I looked again in the mirror and I saw three lights one in front of the other two in the shape of a triangle. Strange feeling of no one around even though this was behind me. I dont know what obsessed me to roll the window down I guess to look without out the reflection of the windows to see it. I heard nothing it was silent all but my car. It was right behind me now and this strange feeling was stronger, and I looked back again and it was black like the night with no stars though, like it had its lights off hovering over my car. I seen a diesel coming on the other side of the highway and I felt relieved and I looked back again and it was gone. I shook my friend, and pulled the car over and told her what happend, I told her we were outside Nellis AFB and maybe someone was playing some kind of sick joke on me, never once thinking it might be a ufo until I seen &#34;it&#34; tonight on the discovery channel. That feeling I had that night came over me again and I dont know what to do or if it might help, but I seen this!, I dont have any idea what it could be and if it was a ufo. I didnt send this in earlier, because for one I didnt know who I should tell and second I didnt want my family and friends to think I was one of those people in them magazines that think they have seen a ufo. Mainly because I didnt and still might not believe it was.<n>

On the front of the piewedge (nose) were two lights, one red and one green non flashing.  It was about 30 feet off the ground. Made no sound except of air flowing across the surface...very faint. Very dark outside and could not tell color of craft. My son and I watched it travel 7 miles to Bouse (East to West) right down the valley. Made a right hand bank, then a left bank ...turned south and disappeared.  It did not increase in speed or in altitude.  At the time of the craft&#39;s passing there were stationary white flashing lights at the South, West, East and North (helicopters?) as if watching...and were quite abit higher in altitude, maybe a mile up.<n>

I stopped my car and got out to look.  I couldn&#39;t beleive it.  I also saw a police car down the block with its flashing lights as if in response to this sight, I don&#39;t know.  I went back to the building to get some input from other people.  By that time the things had moved but were somewhat seeable if you looked.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The objects were all the same size and were a gold/yellow color.  More of a blazing fire color.  At first they were just there, it a semi circle and I thought we were going to get attacked.  Sounds crazy, I know, but that&#39;s why I went back to the building I came from.  I was somewhat frightened but I really wanted another opinion on this.  It didn&#39;t help that a police car was up the block with its lights on.  One other person from the building saw what I saw.  Others tried to look but couldn&#39;t see anything.  As far as my memory will recall, it seems they would appear and then not appear, because they weren&#39;t easily seen after I went back for other opinions.  I must also add that after that event, throughout Long Island skies, I noticed these yellow color &#34;planes&#34; or things that would distract people while they were driving.  This thing would catch your eye in the sky as you&#39;re driving and you couldn&#39;t help watching it.  This may have caused some accidents.  Lasted about 2 weeks. A brief description of my background is that I am of sound mind, a mom of 3, and work for a living, like everyone else.<n>

I noticed what I thought was a falling star. The star, instead of burning out as normal stopped right in the middle of the sky and a green object came out and flew across the sky faster than anything that could possibly be human. It disappeared on the horizon and mind you this thing started in the middle of the sky and took 10 seconds to reach the horizon and disappear.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

We got as close to it as we could on the road then pulled over and got out of the car. It was a cigar shaped craft floating in the air. The craft had lights flashing on it we watched it for a min or two the it dissapered and we noticed it about a mile or two away for about 10 seconds then reappeared in the first place we saw it. It made no noise and was unlike any other aircraft I had ever seen. It looked like it was moving away from us and we lost sight of it so we got back it the car and I drove into the woods to try to see it but we never saw it again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

Looking out to sea witnessed a metalic sphere 500 yards away hovering still about 300ft above sea level.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Me, the driver and two other passengers were spectulating on what the object might be. We quickly came to the conclusion that is was a helium balloon, probably from the fairground in Brighton. After 2 or 3 mins however it started to move around slowly in one direction, then in another direction. It would stop then move agaign. We started to get excited and wondered how many other people were seeing this strange event. It was a clear, sunny day so there must have been many.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Having read much UFO material myself I was convinced that this object was a craft of some kind, since it followed classic descriptions of previous witness accounts from around the world. However I suppose at this point we were not totally convinced.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After about 4-5 mins we saw an unmarked helicopter flying overhead, in what looked like an interception path to the object! My friend thought he saw police markings, but I didn&#39;t notice any. Just as the helicopter got to within about 200 yards of the object it shot off at a steep angle eastwards at an amazing speed that left a brief streak of light, almost as if it had turned into the light itself! At this the helicopter turned round and headed back inland.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were all sober and not under the influence of any drugs. I felt Privileged to witness such an event, but also fairly frightened. I don&#39;t know why none of us reported it at the time, probably because we could barely believe what we had seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.

I saw a distinct traingular object that looked to be as far as the next village 3 miles away. It was over a field on a sunny day with partial cloud. It seemed to stay in the same position for about 5 minutes. My teacher took my attention from the window for about 30 seconds, when I looked back there were some clouds, once they had cleared the image was gone.  After 2 minutes of observation I got my friend sitting next to me to look at it so I knew it wasn&#39;t just me seeing things. She saw it too.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Not sure if this is relevant, but it was near Thurleigh airbase,(Thurleigh, Bedford, Bedfordshire, England), which was used as a base for the American Air force during WWII<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Time and date are approximate.

It was kinda hazy at times but it was following us.I didnt say anything to my husband because i was unsure of what I was seeing and didnt want to sound crazy. It stayed just above tree level and when we reached the shop my husband went in. I continued to watch it because it was in the field to the side of the shop.I watched it more closely because the light became very bright and started moving up and down side to side very fast.Like someone had a flash light and was blinking it on and off.I remember thinking this is not real and also thinking how I had seen stuff like this on tv.We were on a ranch backroad and all i could think was mutalated cows.Ha Ha! So in that instant all these thoughts were going through my mind I started getting a little afraid and then it was gone.It zoomed off like faster than anything i had ever seen.I kept my mouth shut and didnt say anything to my husband when he came out I think I was in disbelief.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

I was in my back yard. I live near the Mesquite airport . I looked up to watch a Cessna 182 puttering along over my house.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When above it I saw a small white teardrop shaped craft climbing above it. Tracing its trajectory backwards it seemed to have taken off from that wooded area around Kleberg-Hutchins or somewhere over there.<n> <n><n> <n><n> If the thing didnt happen to pass right where my eyes just happened to be focused I would never have seen it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Below I recount exactly what I saw: It appeared to be too small to have a human riding in it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was white It was tear drop shaped. With the pointy end to the front.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There were no windows or port holes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was no noise No apparrent means of locomotion. No exhaust ports or intakes of any description. The object ascended on a 35 to 45 degree angle plane effortlessly . The charactacter of the ascent was deliberate , not like a balloon .<n> <n><n> <n><n> I do not think it was extra -terrestrial . It didnt do any extraordinary manuvers that would make me think so.<n> <n><n> <n><n> But it was designed not to attract attention . If my eyes werent focused in the right place I would never have seen it. Indeed there could be a dozen of those things up there and if I were looking up in a general way I would not have noticed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I watched it until it faded from view.  It appeared to not have been leveling off when I lost sight of it.  ( continuing to climb )<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date is approximate.  PD))<n>

Looked up from my desk through the window then open and then saw 2 bright white lights flyby away from me.So my line of sight of them was from the top of my window frame and saw them fly over and away from my house down to the valley and lost sight of them as they flew over some trees and dissappeared behind them. They were pure white lights which sparkled leaving a small tail of light behind them. They were the size of roughly a Soccer ball maybe silghtly bigger. They flew together about 2 meters apart fairly fast and smooth in motion changing altitude in relation to the ground.As they passed over I remember there was no sound produced by them. No sound of air or an engine.Its as if the air did not make any resistance to these objects passing through it at that high velocity.<n> <n><n> <n><n> During this year 1997 I saw these same 2 objects once in the late afternoon as I was going home. I was comming up along the valley in the car and glanced at the skyline over the trees towards my house and saw these same 2 lights appear high in the sky and drop vertically down above the tree line and disappear as if they switched off there lights. The distance from me to the treeline where I saw the lights drop out of the sky and then disaapear was roughly 500meters.It must have lasted 2 seconds.They moved very fast and hovered over the tree line for maybr 0.5seconds before I lost sight of them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had a close up of the same light but this time it was just one on its own.And I saw it as I was in my bedroom looking out the window to one of the trees in my garden about 8 meters away and saw this light fly by 4 meters from me and it made absoluetly no noise what so ever.As if it nothing passed by.It passed me at birds speed and was the size of a football again the same pattern of bright sparkling white light with a tail. It did not have any effect on the nosiey birds in the tree nor my 6  gaurd dogs whoose kennels lie below the tree. It was amazing.I never told anyone I know and kept it to me all these years because I knew no one would belive.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have never seen these lights again since and I have also spent little time in Kenya since but I will never be able to forget this.Surprisingly never did I feel threatened during these encounters or shocked but felt more peacefull then normal.I find that very strange as a natural reaction would be to be startled.I hope this account helps your records and may prove useful to yourselves.

5/15/97 02:00|Londonderry|NH|Light|less than a minute|Flying neon lights|9/24/03|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/031/S31585.html|54|ndxe199705| Flying neon lights<n> <n><n> <n><n> Okay, first of all, I can&#39;t even remember exactly what year this took place (I have a terrible head for dates), so the date is likely way off, but that is my best guess. So is the time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was at my parent&#39;s house - I was home from college for a week or so - using my mom&#39;s computer. This was back when I used chat rooms, so I was in one at the time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The way mom&#39;s desk is set up, when I was using the computer, I couldn&#39;t help but look out the window, so any movement would catch my attention. Being very dark though, that didn&#39;t happen; until I saw these lights, that is.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I don&#39;t remember the exact colors of these lights, but I do remember there was more than one color (I&#39;m pretty sure red and blue were a couple of them). I immediately could say that this was a not plane for several reasons: 1. It was moving fairly slowly.  2. It was apparently flying bewteen the trees immediately behind the house and the forest at the bottom of the hill beyond those first trees - really low, no more than 100 feet from the ground at the bottom of the hill and roughly eye level with me on the second floor.  3. The aforementioned lights looked like neon bars - it appeared they ran along wings, but I could see no substance to this craft - only the lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I exclaimed to the people in the chat room that I just saw a UFO, but that was really the end of it. It flew roughly NNE out of my sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;m not sure what it was. Ultralight, maybe? It&#39;s either that or something I&#39;ll never know about. Either way, it was obviously an object, it was flying, and I sure couldn&#39;t identify it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

I will not even say what craft he flown for fear of narrowing down his chances of being picked out.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The information is that a craft of around a mile in diameter appeared off the coastline of San Diego at night above the cloud layer.  It has multiple antennas dotting across its surface all around it.  It had bulbous mirror like windows spaced out evenly around the entire spacecraft.  Each bulb emitted randomized color effects at a normal pulse of probally 1 per second randomly on any given bulb.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When the pilots were tasked to go out to investigate the anomalous object.  There were already multiple fighter jets on station.  They flew around it for over a hour at the minimum taking pictures and video.  At some point it started pulsating rapidly then completely disappeared.   Winked out that is.<n> <n><n> <n><n> One of those pilots is a high ranking officer and one of those pilots from what I am told was a Nasa director.  This story was told in confidence because a life was saved and felt the need to relieve this information to someone other than themselves.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Collabration between the nasa director and the other pilot upon telling the story were both agreed upon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides little contact information.

Occasionally moving from left to right very quickly.My wife said that it one point had a bright &#34;tail&#34;extending from it.I did not see this feature. It did shange in color from white to orange.At one point it suddenly dropped out of sightstraight down.I went to the front yard to have another look.at this point I saw the object much higher in the sky. Slowly moving north and slightly west.I drove to a location with less light obstruction - within 5 min it had moved rather far away. Traveling north and slightly west. My guess in the direction of Ashfork or even Kingman. There was a 2nd object traveling in the same direction as well.When we first spotted it it seemed to nr VERY close to us.The eratic motion, change in intensity, ruled out an aircraft.Last spotted around 23:15 hours headed north north west as I said.Shape: oval in nature.Color: white changing to orange then staying orange.As it traveled toward the north looked like smaller sattelite objects assosiated with it at times.

A minute before, I had just seen a normal meteorite in that direction of the sky so now we were both looking to the east hoping to see another one.  Suddenly a triangular formation of about 10 reddish, glowing lights appeared or &#34;came on&#34; and flew completely silently overhead from south to north.  They were in such perfect formation that it seemed to be a single craft except for the fact that at one moment several of the lights split quickly apart from the formation then just as quickly reformed and held perfect formation for the remainder of the sighting.  Another odd thing was that I could see through or in-between the lights but there appeared to be a shimmering quality to this space between the lights, like looking through water. Each individual light seemed to be diamond in shape and had a light quality similar to a glowing coal.  Not knowing what I was looking at, it was hard to judge the altitude of the object but if I had to guess, I would say it was at least twice as large as a 747 and about 3000 ft altitude. The total sighting lasted about 30 seconds and the lights simply “blinked out”.  My son and I examined each other’s story immediately after the sighting.  We both saw exactly the same thing.  I am 43, an airline pilot for a major airline and an amateur astronomer.<n>
5/13/97 19:30|Valley Springs|CA|Teardrop|2.5|My father convinced me to report my abduction. So here it is.|9/2/05|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/045/S45087.html|59|ndxe199705| My father convinced me to report my abduction. So here it is.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Around May 1997 it was pretty bright out even though it was about 9:30 pm. I believe there was a full or close to a full moon that night. My best friend, another buddy of ours and I all had a few beers and decided to go for a walk along the lakeside which was really low due to the major drought we had. We parked our truck on the lakeside and started off. We walked about a mile away when I noticed a very bright blue star. I pointed it out to the other guys and we continued on our way. We walked about another half mile and I kept looking at this star when one of the other guys said to me that he needed to sit for a minute. My buddy was 6&amp;#8217;2&amp;#8221; at about 260 lbs at that time. As we sat and chatted I noticed the star had started to move. I then thought to myself that it might be an airplane that was coming right toward us and I didn&amp;#8217;t notice it moving. My friend asked me why I got so quiet and I told him that I was watching this light. He joked and said it was a UFO and we all chuckled a little. We all sat there for a about 1 minute and as eerie as it may sound we all stood up at once and looked at each other. The object was now very close and seemed to be headed in our direction at a great rate of speed. We all stumbled around and started to head back to the truck. Walking fast and checking behind ourselves, I noticed it was now about a foot ball length away.  The object was teardrop shape and almost looked metalic that glowed bright blue at first but looked white as it came closer.  I high tailed it and began to run. This is when things get a little fuzzy in my memory. I remember running, feeling my heart beating really hard. I stepped on a stick and made it crack. I remember hearing a sound about the same high pitch sound it makes when you turn on your television. I don&amp;#8217;t remember hearing my friends anymore or even thinking to turn around. I remember opening my eyes slightly and seeing hardly anything. It was so black and dark wherever I was. I was lying on something flat that was at an angle. I looked down what seemed to be a hallway with an opening about 1 ½&amp;#8217; wide. It was a very tall opening and couldn&amp;#8217;t see the top of it. I noticed an oval shaped hole in what I thought was the floor and could see about 5 sections of finned propellers spinning in reverse direction of each other.  I couldn&amp;#8217;t hear anything except a low hum sound that was steady. I saw a transparent plate of what seemed to be glass with markings on it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The next thing I know I hear my friends yelling and running towards me. I was lying up against my friend&amp;#8217;s truck. They began to ask me where I was. I told them I remembered running toward the truck after seeing the light and then hearing them just know. They didn&amp;#8217;t remember the light and said it was already 12:30 am and that when they got to the truck I wasn&amp;#8217;t there. They thought I ran home and went there to pick me up. After about 2 hours of waiting for me with no return they went back out to the lake to find me. After another hour of looking for me they decided to go back home and that is when they saw me there by the truck. At first I didn&amp;#8217;t remember what I saw until about 2 years later.  I couldn&amp;#8217;t explain why there was a long lapse in time. I tried to talk to my buddy but he said he doesn&amp;#8217;t remember any light. He only remembers me running off and missing until he came back with the truck and them finding me there. I tried to talk to my best friend and he never wanted to talk about it. He always said for me to shut up about it. After 9 years of trying to talk about it with him he finally said he remembers the reason why we ALL started to run. He remembers the light flying by at a great speed and then disappearing but never hearing anything. He said for me being gone for 2 ½ hours boggled him for years and wanted to know where I went. I told him the things I remembered and he said he doesn&amp;#8217;t want to talk about it and will never talk about it again. I tried several times but he gets angry and walks away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I never told my father or anyone what happened.  One day he told me about an encounter he had and I decided to let him know what happened to me.  Since then he told me about this site and keeps asking me if I am going to post my experience.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There you go Dad.  It is now posted.

My friend was driving, and I was in the passenger seat.|1/28/99|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/003/S03143.html|60|ndxe199705| A friend and I had just dropped off another friend in a suburban neighborhood.  My friend was driving, and I was in the passenger seat.  It was a very stary night, and the sky was completely clear.  We were coming upon an intersection where I saw a red, glowing object hovering over a corn field in back of a house across the street, in the left corner of the intersection.  I alerted my friend to its presense, where upon he accelerated in order to get a closer look.  As we neared the intersection the object began to move parallel to the road that we were traveling on.  I had my head out of the window.  The object seemed to be silent.  It maintaned a steady altitude of maybe 300-500 feet.  It then crossed the road in front of us, while gaining altitude, and then traveled off in what appeared to be a southwesterly direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was difficult for my friend and I do accurately estimate the distance between the object and the ground when we first observed it hovering.  It was oval or egg-shaped and glowed red. It seemed to emit an aura of sorts.  When I think back to this experience, due to the behavior of the object and the apparent absence human activity, I do feel as if we had surprised the object when we came upon it.  When it did cross in front of my friend&#39;s vehicle and continued to ascend into the atmosphere I believe that it did so to a certain point at which it stopped and once again hovered.  Because I followed its path with my eyes, I could see its ascension, but eventually the light ceased to move.  At this point I observed that the object did not appear to change in size, as it would if it were continually moving away from my point of observation.  In addition, the intensity of the red light it emitted did not change as it would if it had been moving away in a continuous manner.  At that time it appeared to me as a red light &#34;camoflouged&#34; amongst the spectrum of lights present in the sky.   Although we try to remain skeptical, my friend and I had never before experienced a ufo encounter of this nature.  We are both highly interested in the pursuit of the truth underlying this type of phenomena.<n>

We stopped at a gas station at 11:30 at night in Death Valley. About 3 Football fields away my friend saw a flash then we all looked and two oval like saucers were sorta dancing back and forth in the sky, shooting lights at each other. We just stared, we ran in the station and told people to come look. A few kids ran out and looked but it was gone. We turned at an explosing sound and two parked semis lights, horns and engines flashed on and off. There was no one there though. Then everything was quiet<n>

They appeared to be floating.  Atleast 10 cars were pulled over on the side of the road.  I knew my daughters and I were not seeing things.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I picked up my daughters from a slumber party on FM 1314.  We travelled to Porter which is off of HWY 59.  My 11 year old asked &#34;Mom, oh my God, what is that in the sky?&#34;  I turned around at the Kroger right under the underpass.  She sounded frantic.  I looked and safely said&#34;Probably parachutes.&#34;  I drove back to 59 and proceeded to travel slowly on the feeder road going south towards Houston.  I was shocked and amazed at what I saw.  I looked around me and cars were pulling over on the sides of the road to see the objects.  There were about 15-20.  They looked like rocks or meteors floating suspended in the air.  I pulled over at a car dealership on the right and stared at them.  It was so unreal.  Like I was in a movie and it wasn&#39;t really happening.  One of the rocks looked very strange.  They were all at different altitudes and they were moving slowly towards the west/southwest.  I became aware of the fact that these objects could drop strait on our heads at any second,!so I backed out and left.  I turned around at the next exit.  By the time I got back to the spot and on the other side of the road heading north, the last of them could be seen just over the tree tops.  I headed up 1314 to Conroe.  I thought I could see them from the 242 loop, but no luck.  I don&#39;t know where they went or what in the world they were, but I would like to know if something like meteors can come into our atmosphere and float that way.  They appeared to be in 0 gravity.  With all of the others that saw I know I can&#39;t explain it away.<n>

I had opened my sunroof and killed the engine to try to hear something,but it was silent.It went directly over me and to the opposite horizon,over downtown Ft.Worth and disappeared into the clouds.At this same moment,a military fighter plane flew directly over my head and followed the object into the clouds.I can&#39;t say WHAT this craft was except that it wasn&#39;t like anything I have ever seen before or since.I have become alot more aware of lights in the skies at night and it is not unusual to see something strange,but this is the only time I could rule out ANY NORMAL aircraft.This is within fifteen miles from where Carswell AFB used to be;and maybe 30 miles from Aurora,TX, the location of the &#39;alleged&#39; &#34;Aurora Encounter&#34; that was made into a movie. I have not seen other discriptions like what I saw(flaming circle),but am curious if anyone else has seen anything similar.Please email if this sounds at all familiar.<n>

They hover|1/28/99|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/002/S02213.html|69|ndxe199705| Summary : Observed two objects. One with flashing multi-colored lights, the second, somewhat bell-shaped with two white-yellow lights. They hovered above us and appeared to be observing us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On May 10, 1997 we were camping in a remote part of Los Padres National Forest. Our party consisted of myself, my wife ((Three names deleted)). Our location was a campsite known as Thorn Meadows, approximately 20 miles west of the small town of Lake of the Woods, in Ventura county. The elevation there is approximately 4000 ft., the winds were calm, the sky was clear, the stars were bright. A crescent moon was descending. We had camped at this site on two other occasions and although it is very remote, this was the first time we had not seen any other people in the area all day.At approximately 10:45 PM, we were finishing cleaning up after dinner. We had a fire burning. ((Name deleted)), pointing to the northeastern sky, said something to effect of, &#34;Hey, what is that thing? I’ve been watching it for a while and I can’t figure out what it is.&#34; I looked in the direction he was pointing and I saw a flashing light, at approximately 50 degrees. At first I thought it was someone walking down the hill with a flashlight because of the erratic way it was flashing. I then realised that this could not be because there was no hill in that direction. After watching it for approx. 30 seconds, I realised two things: one, the flashing light it was emitting was rapidly changing color; two, it was moving in an unpredictable, erratic manner that could not possibly have been an airplane or helicopter. It was moving in a way that seemed to indicate it was searching for something. At that instant, I realised immediately it was not an ordinary aircraft. The object then changed dire!ction and came directly at us in a straight line moving at a high rate of speed which I could not quantify. The object then stopped in plain view, at roughly the same angle to the horizon. I found this very disturbing. Then ((Name deleted)) said, &#34;Look, there’s another one.&#34; I turned my head and saw to the southeast, at approximately 30 degrees, another object that had, to me, appeared out of nowhere and was now hovering almost directly above us. This object was different from the other, it had two bright, white-yellow lights and seemed vaguely bell-shaped. Both objects were completely silent and up there you can hear a plane from miles away. I had the distinct but inexplicable sense that they were looking at us. I could not estimate the size or altitude of the objects, but the second object had a similar appearance to a helicopter hovering at maybe 1500 ft. In other words, it was clearly visible.I was quite frightened but ((Name deleted))was absolutely terror-stricken. She was completely resolute that we needed to leave immediately. Seeing the second object sitting up above us was all I needed to make up my mind to go. In seconds we gathered up the dogs, extinguished the fire and got in the truck and I drove as fast as I could down the dirt road. At one point, my wife saw the first object off to the right of our vehicle and believes it was following us. I did not see it and so cannot verify. Later I realised that we were in a classic abduction scenario and I’m glad we left, although I wonder if I would have had it not been for my wife’s urging. I also realise that if they really wanted us, we wouldn’t have had a chance. We spent the night in a motel room in town and went back early in the morning to gather up our things.Let me give you some background here for a frame of reference. I am a skeptical person by nature. In my youth I heard the stories of UFOs and thought, &#34;Well, that could be, but I’ll believe it when I see it.&#34; Then, a number of years ago I read Communion which led to my reading a few other books on the subject. Then I realised what was really going on. However, I am most certainly not one of those people that goes around trying to spot UFOs, in fact the opposite is true. After reading Communion, I hoped to never see one of those things. I have spent a lot of time looking at the night sky and have never, until now, seen anything that was completely inexplicable. I am convinced that there is no way these objects that we witnessed could have been some experimental aircraft. The way they accelerated, stopped, changed direction, I don’t believe that a human would be able to withstand the g forces that would have been generated.<n>

The light moved slightly but pulsed inintensity from star brightness to very bright.A second smaller bright object seemed to flyoff and fly around the larger object with quickmoves above, below and around the large object.At times the small object would drop below thelarger in a falling leaf motion and fly backto the larger object becoming one object agian.We watched from the restaurant for 5 mins andgot into our car and drove to a better locationto watch the object. We parked on the cliff aboveour hotel. We watch this object carry on again foranother five mins before it just blinked out.The object seemed to be several miles away fromour location. No noise and clear skies in the Eastwith the moon to our backs.

These two objects seemed to stop and go, zipping around as if they were playing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Mothers Day weekend I visited my mother who lives in Alabama. That Saturday evening I was going outside to see if there were any remains of the Halle Bopp comet.While star gazing, I saw two objects.  They were round in shape and bright white with blue haze encircling them in color.  At first I only saw one, it was darting forward in an unimaginable rate of speed.After watching about 30 seconds the second object zoomed up behind the first and they were going the same speed for about 10 seconds.  Then the second object stopped still, while the first jetted around at different angles in front and behind the second.I then saw both objects start and stop several times.  Then the first one stopped then went straight up in an instant.  The second object then went forward until it disappeared.Im not sure what these two objects were, but I do know that there are no aircraft or weather ballons that I know of that could have moved at those angles and speeds.I dont want to sound like a kook, but I am curious if anyone else had witnessed this event.  Afterwards, I went in to tell my husband and mother what I had seen and they believed me, but were skeptic and offered several explainations that I found hard to believe.<n>

At one point it elongated itself and moved one point to another almost instantaneously.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At 00:25 am on May 10, 1997, I was getting into bed and glanced out my bedroom window and noticed a large white &#39;star&#39; with a yellowish hue to it with a background of the black sky and other stars.   I remarked that I have never seen such a large &#39;star&#39; before.  It didn&#39;t twinkle as the other stars did, which make me even more curious.  Its shape wasn&#39;t circular, but rather more a square with concaved side.  (Discription of star shape:  Place a square on one its corners, and its axises both vertical and horizontial, take the circumferencial straight lines and cause them to become concaved towards the center-point where the axises of square meet. )  This was the shape of the &#39;star&#39;.After looking at the star for about ten seconds, it disappeard.  It reappeard several seconds later to the left of its original position.  The color had changed from the yellowish white to blueish white.  The size had also changed, it resembled more like a regular star size.  Intermittenly the blueish light would flash, although not at regular intervals.  Occasionally (two or three times), a small red light flashed (but not as frequently as the &#39;white&#39; light) This red light was also irregular in its flashing.  No blue light was ever seen as in regular aircraft lights.The light moved from its &#39;9 o&#39;clock&#39; position to the &#39;center of the clock&#39; position&#39; and immediately perform a 90 degree turn to the &#39;12 o&#39;clock&#39; position. in a fraction of a second.  There was no gradient climb from the &#39;9 o&#39;clock&#39; to the &#39;12 o&#39;clock&#39; positions, even in the other movements mentioned below.It remained for several seconds in the &#39;12&#39; position, and performed a vertical descent to the &#39;6 o&#39;clock&#39; position.  (No red light flashing)The light continued this movement between the above four points, but never, while I viewed it, move to the &#39;3 o&#39;clock&#39; position.At one point in its movements, from the &#39;9&#39; to the &#39;center&#39; positions, the object seemed to elongate itself and be at both positions at the same time for only a fraction of a second, and then repositioned itself  from the &#39;9&#39; to the &#39;center&#39; positions.I decided to get my video camera, and after a quick search of two rooms, found it and returned to the bedroom, but unfortunaltely the light was gone, so I did not get it on video.Total time was about a 1 minute to a minute and a half.<n>

I observed 6-8 white round lights south of my location approx 3 miles at an altitude of approx. 10,000. The objects stayed in one place while they would cluster into such a tight formation that they appeared as one, then manuver into a V shape, inverted V shape, straight line and then back to a cluster. I went into my house and got my wife, 42 years old and two children 20 and 22 years to witness what I saw. We four watched the objects for approximately 2-3 minutes as they travelled west continuing to manuever into the aforementioned shapes until out of sight.I am a retired police officer, 47 years old. I have been trained to observe and report observations. This is the first such &#34;sighting&#34; myself and family have seen, however, I do believe in UPOs. I have trained as a pilot and have flown privately since 1968 and commercially since 1958. These objects were NOT conventional aircraft.

I was facing south from the area of Decatur and Charleston. I was intrigued because the lights were a bit unusual.  I watched them coming towards my location.  Two of the lights appeared to be closer than the rest as they appeared to separate slightly from the rest as they got closer, as if they were a bit forward of the others.  All lights appeared to be connected to one object since they did not move with respect to one another except for the above.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As it got a bit closer I realized that it was NOT an airplane.  I nudged my friend I was sitting with and said: LOOK AT THAT!  She watched it pass directly overhead with me.

My husband , who was in the army/airborne, said he had never seen any thing like it before as well.<n> <n><n> <n><n> please let us know if anyone else saw it!<n> <n><n> <n><n> I just sent a email to you, I gave you the wrong date!  We saw this on Tues night 05/06/97,  my husband just remembered that the lights were of different sizes, one large very bright light in the center, he also said that he saw what he thought to be a helicopter about 30 sec after we could no longer see the ufo, this helicopter ( non military type, more like a Bell helicopter) was moving very fast, and appeared  to be leaving the area, as fast as it could go!<n>

It then occured to me that it was in the wrong area to be either leaving or arriving at the airport. I then noticed that the lights which I had though were the wing tip lights, (which as you know blink red and green) were only white and that they were blinking in a circular pattern. There appeared to be a red light on the underside of the object which did not blink. The white lights were very bright and continued flashing the entire time that the object was visible to me. The object appeared to be cruising very slowly approximately 1 to 2 miles away. I could not hear any sounds coming from the object even though it is very quiet at that time of morning.The object appeared to be circular in shape but overall was similar to the shape of a derby hat with a domed section on top. from my vantage point I would estimate the size to be approximately 25 feet in diameter. As ti travelled I eventually lost sight of it as trees in the area blocked my view. I am a 45 year old male, I wear glasses and the other observer was my son who is a 15 year old male, he does not wear glasses. The entire sighting lasted approximately 2 minutes.<n>

Going higher, a beam of light shone from the object until it disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My son and I saw what looked like a very bright shooting star, going up and not down.  It had a very wide tail that was also very bright.  We watched it go up into the sky for a total of approximately 10 minutes.  As it went higher, the intensity subsided.  It was in the northwestern sky above the mountains.  It changed direction after going up for about 5 minutes.  It then turned to a more northerly direction as it got smaller and higher.  As we looked at it, my son and I both saw what looked like a wide beam of light coming from this object shining down to earth.  We couldn&#39;t see it go all the way down because the light was partly behind the mountains at that time.As the object kept getting higher, we also noticed a smaller light below this object, approximately 3 inches below, if using your fingers to measure.  It was moving in a northeastly direction and moved very fast and again, using your fingers to measure, it moved approximately 5 inches in that direction and then it disappeared.  The first object continued moving higher and then it too disappeared.We watched for a few minutes longer but could not see either object anymore.<n>

5/7/97 01:00|Santa Monica|CA|Disk|2 minutes|On May 7, 1997 I was looking north to the Santa Monica mountains and saw what I believed to be a helicopter shining its lights down on|1/28/99|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/002/S02236.html|84|ndxe199705| Summary : On May 7, 1997 I was looking north to the Santa Monica mountains and saw what I believed to be a helicopter shining its lights down on the ocean or the mountains. I live in a penthouse where I have a wonderful view of the Santa Monica Mountains, the ocean and the city.  On a clear night, as this was, I can see very far.  I often sit out side to relax and look at my surroundings.  It is not uncommon to regularly see helicopters and planes from my view, especially with LAX so near.  This particular evening I saw what I thought to be a helicopter and it  really caught my attention.  I noticed that this helicopter was silent and usually they make quite a bit of noise.  I was looking at the object that I believed to be a helicopter and there was a direct light that it was shining  on the mountains, like a spotlight,  and moving low towards the ocean.  It was in a two to three mile distance of me, which is common for most of the helicopters in the area.  The light that I was watch!ing closely, without suspicion, disappeared, leaving puffs of smoke.  This was a trail of smoke that I had never seen a plane or a helicopter leave before.  The smoke was thick as if the object that it was coming from had been idled there for a long peroid of time and it had not been.  A few seconds later the object took off with enormous speed, heading north to the sky.  this is when I realized that the object could not be a helicopter at all.  Within seconds it was &#34;parked&#34; next to a star, very far away..  It probably reached its location next to the star in under five seconds. It was a clear path that it took and  it was as if it was trying to camaflauge itself  next to that star.  Then I saw a flashing red light that was actually  revolving.  From the distance where I was I could see the object and  I could tell that it was revolving with a red light..  A few seconds later it took off so fast that I could see it going north for about two seconds but it was going so fast th!at it just disappeared.  That is when I realized that I had seen a UFO.  I immediately called a friend and left a detailed message on her voice mail, as to not leave out any details and record it while it was fresh in my mind.  The next day I had to go out of town and did not know of your service until now.  I feel very relieved to have reported this and hope that someone may have seen something also.I have lived in California for a little over a year.  I moved to California from South Carolina for a job.  I am twenty four years old and am fairly concervative in my beliefs.  I was raised an &#34;Army Brat&#34;, therefore traveling is nothing new to me.   I run four miles every morning before work and consider myself to be very social.  I have never looked up the UFO website before.<n> <n><n> <n><n> See above listed information.<n>

We were just north of Round Rock on *-35 when I looked over towards the group of radio towers to the northeast.  It was dus, but still there was a good amount of twilight out.  The sun I believe had set a few minutes or so minutes earlier.  Above the antena group, I saw this jet black rectangle that had four small white lights on each corner and in the middle was a greenish gold light in the center. It hovered there for what seemed to be a couple of minutes.  My partner and I watched it as we were driving northbound on the interstate.  We knew what radio stations were broadcasting from that tower group.  We tuned in those radio stations and there sememed to be no interfearence from the object.  Shortly thereafter, the light in the middle of the object turned a bright greenish white and took off at an incredible accelaration towards the north north east.  There was no sound from the craft during hovering or during it&#39;s departure. I figure that the size of it was roughly the same as a football field, judging it&#39;s position relative to the ground and radio towers.  At the distance we were at, it was about the size of your hand held flat and pointed across your line of sight.  That&#39;s the last we saw of it.<n>

It caught my eye because of the straight line and how bright it was.  I was watching it and trying to figure out what it was, when it slowly started fading away, and then it was completely gone.  I looked around in the sky and noticed there were no other stars out.  At first I thought it might be an airplane, but it disappeared so fast.<n>

There were 5-8 lights in a straight line almost directly overhead.  For a split second I thought they were some planetary alignment, but quickly realized that they were too bright and too perfectly aligned for that to be the explanation.  The sky was perfectly clear and it was still too light for any stars or planets to be visible.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We watched the lights for a brief period of time and discussed what we were seeing.  We weren’t sure if it was one object with lights on it or a well-aligned formation of separate objects.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Suddenly the lights started to dim and move closer together as if they were moving outward.  This movement was so rapid that it was similar to the effect in Star Trek of &#34;going into warp speed.&#34;<n> <n><n> <n><n> At the time, we made a call to a local T.V. station to ask if anyone else had seen it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The next night, there was a brief report on the weather portion of the news that a number of people had reported strange lights of unknown origin.  The weather reporter said that the lights were multiple planes lined up in a flight path for landing.

I caught a glimps of something moving from the corner of my eye.When I turned to look at it, I saw a triangular shape moving slowly at about a 45 degree angle. It seemed to be rather close, as I could make out the dark edges against the starry background. If I recall correctly, the object had three lights , one on each point of the triangle. The object made no sound. I immediatly called to my friend to ask if he was seeing what I was. He had not seen it, but just then we both saw something. This one was different. It looked only like a point of light, no noticeable shape. We saw several objects of this kind. They were more over head of us, and moved to the west\southwest. Some moved at incredible speeds, zigging and zagging across the sky. While others moved in what appeared to be a formation. First came four in a row, then six then eight. Some even looked as though they split in two. After about 20 min. of this we both spotted a triangle- shaped object, this one right over us, we could see lights on the bottom side. The lights seemed to change  color, from red to orange and white. It was very peculiar. We watched this go on for hours, or necks grew tired from cocking them back to see, so we layed down. I remember the clock was at 4:20 when I went in to bed. This was the third sighting I&#39;ve experienced. In April of the same year,I watched a trianlgle-shaped craft silently fly across the sky in front of me. It had three lights. I was with a different friend, on the same deck. And once before a couple of years earlier, I would have been 18, so that was 1994. It was in spring, this one was like the triangular ones, but much higher. It moved horizontaly for a moment, before shooting upwards at a fantastic speed until I could no longer see it. Again I heard nothing. Neither I, nor my friend know just what we&#39;ve seen. Could have been military. Who knows what they were, but they were not like anything I! have ev er seen before or since.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

The craft approached from the sea, the west, and made a slight change on course to the northeast. From our position 100&#39; south of the Newport Beach pier it looked like a giant F-117 (bigger than a football field). Triangular in shape and flying at about 4000&#39; and 250mph. 5 lights on each leading edge of each wing like small stars, the body could have been translucid toward the back. It was totally silent.

What was this thing?<n> <n><n> <n><n> My husband (fiance at the time) and I were standing out in front of my parent&#39;s house in the driveway, kissing goodnight.  The moon was bright when we started our goodnight kiss, but within seconds it appeared to suddenly became very dark, and very quiet.  It was as if we were standing in an absence of sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We stopped kissing and looked up into the sky, and moving directly over my parent&#39;s house was a HUGE black triangular craft.  It was absolutely silent, except for a slight hissing of moving air.  The craft could not have been more than 100-200 yards over the house, so we got a fantastic look at the underside of the object.  There were dim lights on the underside, and on the back of the object as it moved away from us over the rest of the neighborhood at a VERY VERY slow speed.  We just stood there in complete silence watching this thing move away until we could not see the object any longer.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Once the object passed, we could see the moon again, and normal night sounds filled the area.   Both of us, looked at each other, quickly said goodnight, and I ran into the house. He quickly got into his car and drove to his home.  I was pretty freaked out by what we saw, and looked for an explanation in the paper the next day, but there was nothing reported.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We are not located near an airforce base, nor have any military maneuvers run over our city that I am aware of.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This object was so low to the ground, it was as if we were looking up at the underside of a Star Wars model.  The object was moving from the West to the South East through the night sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I told my folks the next morning, but they shrugged it off as something military.  Was this a UFO, or could it have been a secret military craft?  We have not spoken about this to many folks for fear they would think we were nuts.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We didn&#39;t realize that there was a place to report such sightings, or we would have reported this when it happened.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of sighting is approximate.

I immediately thought it was odd and tracked it through the eye piece.  It must have been heading roughly due north since I only adjusted declination to track it. It appeared to be like an &#34;amoeba&#34; containing lights of red, blue and white.  It seemed there was distortion and the lights varied in position as if mildly bouncing yet constrained by individual points and still all part of the same object.  That described distortion was nothing like atmospheric and since I spotted the polar ice cap and terrain colors in a town near Houston, it seems odd.  I knew I was seeing something extraordinary and allowed my wife to look into the eye piece as I spun the declination knob at an appropriate speed.  Apparently I had only captured part of the object since she described the end section I had described plus a disc of lights numbering a dozen, half circle of red and half blue with two white lights!opposite each other outside of the circle.  Further, there were two fainter lights inside the circle and one outside towards the trailing section.  She reported sharper detail in some of the lights.  I moved back to view and had lost the object.  I scanned and found nothing.  We looked to the sky and saw nothing.  There was no noise.  We only got a few seconds each to look at it.  I’m sorry I let my wife look since I may have been able to track it longer and get a better look.  I spent the rest of the evening tracking airplanes and could not get the same results.  I later heard of sightings like this with terms like &#34;jellyfish&#34; and &#34;translucent&#34; which prompted me to report that I think I’ve seen the same thing.  I wish I could have had a better look.Observers:  ((Name deleted)) financial analyst, amateur astronomer and photgrapher.

I found these reports for the same incident that took place at the same time,witnessed by others in the area.  I could not believe this when I found that the incident I had been replaying in my mind for 15 years was not only witnessed by others by sounded almost exactly the same.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was walking with a group of 5 friends and noticed a bright, primarily white light in the North Eastern sky. I pointed to the object and the others believed it to be a star.  The bright light kept getting bigger and soon was accompanied by a low wurring sound much like a blimp.  Soon the object was about 20-30 feet above us moving at an amazingly slow speed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What happened next is not a hoax or a prank. A bright light from what appeared to be some type of spotlight came on and when it came on it was immediately focusing on one of my friends.  It did not search around until it found something like you would expect from a normal &#34;spotlight,&#34; it literally turned on and was shining on him at the exact same moment.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I turned around and began to run back up the lane and briefly turned to watch my friend dive behind a pile of gravel.  The object continued to move slowly North East over my farmland property on the outskirts of Freeport.  We reassembled and did not know what had just happened. We looked out onto the horizon and saw 4-5 other lights that looked identical to the object we had first observed when we thought it was a star and each of these objects were traveling in other directions. -Thanks<n>

Binocs &amp; t-scope.<n> <n><n> <n><n> While stargazing my friend Ron and I observed a brilliant white flash to the south of us.  This was two or three minutes after having sighted a satellite passing from south to north. After an interval of perhaps 15-20 seconds we both observed a second flash and were able to make out object with naked eye.  Appeared very similar to satellite that had just passed.  Observers: ((Name deleted)); financial analyst, amateur astronomer and photgrapher. ((Name deleted)); book keeperWitness to observers; ((Name deleted)); home loan mortgage processor It would then dim to yellow and then pale yellow (about the same intensity as the satelite) and would then burst again. At first, the object was headed due north, then, at about 80 degrees (almost directly overhead) it veered about ten degrees west, then continued in a straight line n/nw.  During its traverse trained his telescope on object.  He has done this many time with aircraft and can make out the navigation lights of such.  This had no visible navigation lights.  The glow, or i!ntensity of light at dim stage, and the comparison to satellites we have observed would put this object at satellite height. No tail observed.  Both of us have seen many aircraft at night and are familiar with what a strobe looks like at great altitude.  This was far more intense and the intermittent nature was not like A/C strobes.  It appeared to accelerate at burst and slow down with dimming? Weird. As the object was about 10 degrees or less from dropping out of our view in the N/NW, a second object appeared to the west of the first at approximately the same distance and displayed the same white burst behavior.  Alternated bursts with first object.<n>

Six of us noticed it from a balcony at a party. I am a working daily journalist. With me were two Oceanside city council members. This object &#34;floated&#34; north for about two or three minutes, then stopped. After about a minute or so, it began moving back south-southwest over the water. Altitude was hard to determine, but it appeared to be climbing, albeit ever-so slowly. At one point, a small &#34;spark&#34; like object slowly fell from the main object. Through biconculars I was able to see four (4) distinct lights in a diamond shape. This object slowly faded from sight directly above our city&#39;s Pier. I honestly thought it was a balloon someone had set afire and let drift, but it wouldn&#39;t have burned that long and, because of our off-shore breeze, which was slight that night blowing inland, no balloon would have drifted p!arallel against the wind, then reverse course. Yes, we were at a party. No, no one was drunk.

But the longer watched, the more it seemed to be gaining in altitude.Altitude: 500 to 600 feet.A second object &#34;drifted&#34; off to the southeast for about what seemed to be a short distance, as if it were a spark falling away, but then it seemed to hover in mid-air.Observers:1.

It was a May night sometime mid-month 1997 I think when myself and a couple of friends were doing a little night fishing on Oneida Lake about 15 miles north of Syracuse, NY Around about ten pm one of my friends noticed a group of three bright lights in a row across the lake(about four miles) and over the hills to the south. As we watched three or four other lights blinked on in  line with the other three. This looked exactly like the lights in the video footage that was captured in Phoenix.We must have sat there for over an hour watching these lights.Some of the lights would seem to flicker on and off but they would always appear back in a straight line.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We could not make out any shape of any object and there was no noise.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The lights were still there near 12 am when we left.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The area where the lights were is on the flight path for planes landing at Hancock airport. I&#39;ve seen planes with their landing lights on and when they come toward you they look like they are hovering.These lights however were brighter and were aligned perfectly and couldn&#39;t have possibly been commercial aircraft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A week or so later a niece of mine who lives near the lake said she saw a formation of unmarked black helicopters fly over in the afternoon; however she was not sure if it was the same day that I had the sighting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.

Approx. 15-25 minutes after loosing sight of the craft i observed a single military aircraft going in the same direction at a similar altitude (maby 500 ft.) at a very high rate of speed on what I can only assume was an intercept course.<n>

I do not specifically recall the year, I know within a 3 year range, but could not possibly ever recall the exact date because neither my friend nor I made a record of the observation.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My friend and I were contemplating leave the tent because the air was getting cold as the evening progressed. We unzipped tent entrance which faced to the East. I poked my head out and immediately noticed the apparent lights which couldn&#39;t have been anything produced by human beings. Without moving, I told my friend to poke his head out to observe the site and he saw the exact same thing as I did.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We noticed lights in a &#34;V&#34; shape with the point being closest to us. Since this at night, it&#39;s impossible to judge both the distance above the ground and distance of the lights/craft but they &#34;appeared&#34; to be within 2 miles of the surface and over 1/2 of a mile in length. These lights were blue in color. I believe there were either 7 or 9 lights, I do not recall, but they were in a perfect &#34;V&#34; shape. The lights were shining down towards the surface, with the closest one almost directly above us, but they didn&#39;t light up whatever they were attached to. These could have been separate crafts in a perfect &#34;V&#34; shape or just one craft with all the lights on them, but you couldn&#39;t see above the lights. The front of the &#34;V&#34; was pointing towards the North. The rear of the lights stretched far away from the front. The lights appeared to be perfectly spaced out from one another with thousands of feet in between them. Thousands of feet is more-than-likely an understatement, but again it would be impossible to tell in the dark, especially with it being up in the sky at an undermined altitude.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was absolutely no sound coming from the light sources and no movement either. They appeared to hover in place throughout the entire duration of the siting. We were both afraid we had been spotted and didn&#39;t know if it were possible for us to be harmed so we didn&#39;t run, move, or anything except quietly whisper on infrequent occasion. I believe 10 minutes had passed before we felt safe enough to duck inside the tent. We discussed what we had seen to make sure our stories were identical and not fictitious. We both agreed going into my parents&#39; house was the best decision because staying in the tent wouldn&#39;t give us the safety we felt we needed. At this time, we were unsure if we were going to be abducted, left alone, or have any other insane experience because seeing the UFO was astonishing, so at this point, we felt anything was now a possibility.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After 5 minutes of discussion, we grabbed our pillows and looked out again prior to making a dash for the house. We slowly poked our heads out and were both amazed to notice the lights were not there, or not on, one of two cases. I didn&#39;t think they could have been off, my assumption was they had vanished, but I suppose they could have just been off. The thought never entered my mind until typing this recount of the events. No sound was ever heard and the massive array of lights were not seen again. We ran into the house and told my parents about it. They didn&#39;t doubt we believed what we saw, however, they had never seen anything like what we described and didn&#39;t know if any possible explanation was possible other than a UFO. At least 9 years have passed before I wrote this recount of the events.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD))<n>

I just remember my friend and I being outside (this happened about 5 years ago) and there was a big white flash in the sky, definitely not lighting, so we looked up and immediately saw a giant white streak go across the sky. Unlike a shooting star, the tail remained and slowly faded away. There was the flash, a shooting and then the thick and bright white tail that lasted a good 10-15 seconds before disappearing. We didn&#39;t really see any particular shape, but it was definitely not lighting followed by an asteroid. It was much larger and slower than something burning up in the atmosphere.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

5/1/97 16:00|Torquay (UK/England)||Circle|20 seconds|UFO in Torquay in the UK.|8/28/03|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/030/S30585.html|107|ndxe199705| UFO in Torquay in the UK.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was walking home from college by myself at about 4 o&#39;clock in the afternoon. i was heading down the road behind my house which is on a hill looking across a shallow valley. on the other side of this valley is a wooded area just off from a housing estate. in the side of this wooded area is a building called rowcroft hospice. this building is very distinctive. there&#39;s a couple of old looking buildings and a larger one with a big domed roof. you can see these buildings clearly from where i was and from almost anywhere in the valley.<n> <n><n> <n><n> so i was walking down this road and i glanced up over the valley towards the woods and happened to notice something large and metal there. i looked closer and saw a saucer shaped metal object. now i am interested in ufos and was before seeing this, and in the past i&#39;ve often thought what would it be like to actually see something like that. but when it came to it, it didn&#39;t seem that strange. i think it was that it was the middle of the day and in the middle of a busy town. it was very unreal, i was just like &#34;oh, that&#39;s unusual&#34;. i didn&#39;t even stop walking. so i kept looking for a few seconds and saw that whatever it was it was definately in the air, i&#39;d guess about 30-40 ft off the ground, and it was hovering above the rowcroft hospice i mentioned earlier. it was definately some kind of craft, it was just obvious, and made of a very shiny metal. it was saucer shaped but plain, no portholes or any features at all. just a plain metal saucer. so i looked for about 4-5 seconds then i looked down the road for just a few seconds, thinking &#34;what is that?&#34;. then i looked back and it had vanished! no sign of it anywhere i could see. and i could see the hospice&#39;s domed roof clearly again. i really wish now i hadn&#39;t looked away so i could have seen if it just disappeared or moved off really quickly. in fact i wish now i&#39;d just paid more attention to what i was seeing and that i&#39;d had something to record it with. so what was it? was i really just across the valley from some genuine et&#39;s? who knows? i wish to god their was some way i could find out the truth about it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> a couple of points about all this: someone i told about this said i probably mistook the domed roof of the hospice for something, but no way, the roof looks old and mossy, the thing was shiny and reflective.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Second, This is all 100 percent true. i want to share an honest experience which i never recount in the real world. i&#39;ve only told two friends about this and both blatantly didn&#39;t believe a word i said. it sounds too nuts! Third, isn&#39;t it wierd that i saw this over a busy town in the daytime? maybe it goes on all the time and we just don&#39;t notice because we don&#39;t walk round looking up all the time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> And lastly, the thing that fascinates me most about this whole thing is the place where i saw it. For anyone who doesn&#39;t know a hospice is a place where people with fatal diseases go to spend their final months. Now what was this craft doing there in particular? I mean it was hovering right above it and it&#39;s an isolated building. so what did it want? Somebody tell me!<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date of incident is approximate.  PD))<n>
