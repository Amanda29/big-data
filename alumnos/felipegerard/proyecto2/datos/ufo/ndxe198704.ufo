Over Negros Island, Philippines, by amateur astronomer working on Observatory dome|1/17/04|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/034/S34152.html|1|ndxe198704| Daylight &#34;disc&#34; ? Over Negros Island, Philippines, by amateur astronomer working on Observatory dome<n> <n><n> <n><n> BACOLOD CITY (10-deg/50-min N-lat; 122-deg/51-min E-long;) Province of Occidental Negros PHILIPPINES  It was a clear sunny mid-afternoon day, and I was on our rooftop supervising the construction of the Observatory dome.  At the time, the other witness was doing the welding job on the dome while I was seated (on the roof)facing due east.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then this &#34;light&#34; which I would estimate to be of magnitude (brightness) of about -2 or -3.0 (or about the brightness of Venus at the time of its greatest brilliancy or a little brighter), caught my attention. (But Venus could never be more than 48 degrees in angular distance from the sun during the times of its greatest elongation,so Venus is definitely ruled out as a possibility).<n> <n><n> <n><n> If my memory serves me right, I think I also called the attention of the welder/laborer to this bright object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was moving too slow, but not slow enough compared to an aircraft (viewed flying from a far distance).  My initial comprehension was that it was an aircraft somehow reflecting the afternoon sun which was at my back, due west, at the time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Looking at it, however, I could not discern any noticeable appendage(s)that would indicate its nature as an aircraft- and that the object simply appeared as a bright (starlike) object against the (blue of the) daytime sky. What caught my interest was the fact that the light (from my perspective and viewpoint) did not appear to be reflected sunlight in a way.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was about 40 degrees altitude when first seen, and its rather slow movement in the sky towards a northernly direction took it inside some cloud cover after which it was not seen again (though it was still visible through portions of cloud breaks).<n> <n><n> <n><n> A few seconds after it was first sighted, the intense (starlike) lighting seemed to have faded to a dull metallic (greyish) color, but I could still not discern any noticeable appendages or structures to indicate that it was an aircraft. From its apparent distance, no sound was heard (although no sound may be expected even from a passing aircraft at that distance which I have no way of estimating).<n> <n><n> <n><n> It is common for me to watch a commercial airliner from Australia passing through the sky at about this time of the afternoon, but it was at a different date than its usual flight schedule.  Also, the commercial jet aircraft leaves contrails. That object did not. All these/ the sighting took no less than 2 minutes- but could not have been more than 3-minutes, in duration.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It could not have been a balloon or blimp since we don&#39;t have (normally) these things flying around in a country like the Philippines.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As a non-professional (amateur) astronomer and formerly a Field Investigator for CUFOS, I am inclined to believe it may have been a mis-identified man-made aircraft of some kind, UNLESS it was indeed something OTHERWISE.<n> <n><n> <n><n> P.S./ This Report was earlier submitted to CUFOS after the sighting incident. It is submitted here only for purposes of public information and official recording with your organization.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Approxiamately 8:15pm.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Located at Seattleâ€™s Madrona Park Beach with a friend, I saw a large blimp object that was glowing orange and yellow in color. It rose from the trees behind us. The object was about 50-100 feet long and stayed just above tree level. The object was silent but periodically made a low pitched sound (like a low growling noise).<n> <n><n> <n><n> It slowly floated from the trees and stopped in front us. The object hovered above Lake Washington for 10-15 minutes and drifted across the lake (east towards the city of Bellevue).  It looked like a blimp, but the core of the object looked fluid (like yellow orange and red lava).  There was a reddish black square that hung just below the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object was so close, that it produced an orange hue over all of us.  I also felt static electricity. The object slowly changed shape and orientation.  At one point, it looked as the object was tearing into the sky itself (its hard to explain).<n> <n><n> <n><n> There were many witnesses at the park at that time; including a Metro bus driver on the #2 route.  Even boats in the water stopped to look at it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was 16 at the time, and I will never forget.  Whatever it was, it did not seem to be friendly.<n>

I felt a strong energy like a magnetic pull.  I looked to the sky and just above the tree line about three football fields in length away, i witnessed a blimp shaped object hovering.  It made a very low pitched humm! and was bright orange and redish in color.  It had windows which appeard to be in the same location of that of a blimp would be.  I stared in disbelief for a few minutes it seemed then realizing what i was seeing I ran to the closest front door of a home.  I pounded on the front door. A woman answered the door,  I frantically tried to explain to her there was something in the sky outside and she needs to come see for herself.  She slammed the door shut immediately.  I ran back out to the spot i was before and it was still there.  I dont recolect how long i continued to stare up at this object but it had a strange aura and frequency that was very strong and pulling.  I don&#39;t remember going home i just woke up in my bed and have never forgotten this night. I am now thirty five years old and tell this story to people who seem to be openminded enought to maybe believe it was real.  thank you.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date is approximate.

4/22/87 23:30|Rockford|IL|Sphere|15 Mins|Huge Orange Shaped sphere hovering about the ground about 3 feet.|9/17/00|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/013/S13937.html|4|ndxe198704| Huge Orange Shaped sphere hovering about the ground about 3 feet.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Every night I use to drive my girlfriend home using the same path.  Harrison to S. Main, S.Main to olgeby road.  Down this road to Peripont to auburn to her house. I made this trip almost every night for about 4 years. On Olgeby road there are a few house, and a Large Milk plant, most of the houses are farm houses and are surrounded by corn fields.  It was Early spring so th fields were just soil. I had made the trip to her house, dropped her off, and was on my way back home same path back just in reverse, I turned onto olgeby road and started to head down it, thise road is only about 2 miles long before it hit&#39;s S.Main.  It has so small hills heading up east and would be heading downward west.  So the road was higher in places, well as I topped the largest hill, I slammed on my breaks, because to the right of me about 35 feet tall there was this HUGE and I mean Huge Orange sphere hovering above the ground over the empty cornfield.  I stood there gazing at it out my passenger window.  I wasn&#39;t really scared just shocked that there it was just hovering there, there was no sound, and the light from it was lighting up about 50 feet around it.  I finally stepped out my car and began to look over the top of the car at it.  He just sat there, I watched it for a good 15 mins before I became spooked and felt like getting out of there.  My Brother lived about a mile down the street off of S.Main so i drove like a bat out of hell, got him in the car we went back and the object was gone.  I would estimate it&#39;s size to be from 60 to 70 feet tall, and least 120 foot round.  It wasn&#39;t smooth it had what looked like panels, but the seams couldn&#39;t be seen. Couple days later my brother called me and told me he had seen what i discribed floating over the river while crossing the harrison streey bridge. Just for the record i didn&#39;t experience any time loss, or haven&#39;t had any physical side affects from this. I also seen those large Orange balls in the sky back in Feb.  And you know what, if you asked me i&#39;d say they were the same thing.  Just tonight I remembered seeing that object that night because of the recent sightings here in Rockford, I think they are connected, and I don&#39;t care what officals say about it. People ask me why I am saying something about it now? Well because back then i was a teenager, and besides my brother. My mom, girlfriend, and friends say i was making it up. I am older now, and i know for a fact it was real, and i know what i encountered.<n>

After ignoring her cries for three times,I was compelled to go check the situation out because of her &#34;close encounter&#34; scream! Upon entrance of the back porch facing the ocean ,I then observed a tubular shaped flying vehicle beaming the most spectacular blinding light into the ocean waters not more than 1000 yards away from shore!I turned to Mom and We both began to more or less &#34;freak-out&#34; about what We were seeing! I then instructed her to examine every detail about this &#34;thing&#34; so that We could better remember it&#39;s design. Imagine,if you will,say a 747 jet without any wings or tail,only gigantical and unpainted,the bare metal design showing no rivets whatsoever.Windows adorned the side from front to back and forms of occupants were hazily seen behind some in the mid-section.It made no noise! I! t hovered over the ocean as if looking for something in the shallow surf[speculation].I then left Mom and ran to the car and sped away at at least 80m.p.h. in a 20m.p.h. zone to the Phelps&#39; pier at the end of Carolina Ave. North and slung the car around to face the still oncoming slow sailing airship. This angered local residents who came to confront my recklessness , but once I pointed to that &#34;thing&#34; all was astonished at &#34;it&#34;.As it neared I clicked my bright headlights on it. It then slowly swung around and faced me dead straight! It now looked like a circle and had it&#39;s light off. It began to hover over me. At this point I closed my eyes and began to fervently PRAY!! When I looked back up ,it slowly moved back to surf just beyond the pier and &#34;blasted&#34; is too slow the term for it&#39;s departure! Instantly in the distance Wrightsville Beach N.C. lit up from the u.f.o.&#39;s lightbeam. After a few min. the same thing began at Topsail Beach&#39;N.C. . This happened up the North Carol! ina eastern coastline untill it faded from my sight. When I ! ! returned home my mom said local news would carry the story at 11:00 which was just coming up. In a brief report , they mentioned that the u.f.o. sightings being called in was nothing more than a &#34;Coast Guard Drug Survailence Vehicle&#34;! O.K. Carolina Beach &#39;You remember this!! Who could ever forget?! Back me up on this!  UPDATE AND CORRECTIONS TO ORIGINAL POST ABOVE  I wanted to be more precise on this as it was something that was vague in it&#39;s post back then. I just wanted to clarify it.It bothers me that so far only the first witness(my mom)has responded and posted about this event.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As best as I can recollect,(as the exact time frame escapes me),it was in the summer start in 1987 of mid April. I was a local resident of Carolina Beach, NC. Lying on my back in bed, playing an electric guitar unplugged, I began to hear my mother yelling from our back porch that she was seeing a UFO. After ignoring her three times,I was finally compelled to rise up and go check the situation out because she had just frantically ran up to my locked door and screamed out... &#34;It&#39;s a close encounter of the 3rd kind!&#34; So with that statement it really got my attention and upon my entrance out the back door onto the porch facing the ocean ,I then observed a very large and long tubular shaped flying vehicle that was beaming the most spectacular blinding light into the ocean waters not more than 1,000 yards away from shore! I turned to Mom and we both began to more or less &#34;freak-out&#34; about what we were seeing! I was astonished at it&#39;s huge dimensions and how far it spanned down the! coastline to it&#39;s right from it&#39;s front front. It had large rectangular windows that started from behind the nose section all the way to the rear. I was stunned at the close up encounter of this ship because of it&#39;s magnitude and awe commanding presence. I turned and looked at my mom and saw an expression I had never seen on her face and told her ...&#34;You should see the look on your face&#34; and she replied the same thing back to me! I then instructed her to please examine and to pay close attention to every detail about this &#34;thing&#34; so that we could better remember it&#39;s design having no camera to capture the image. I told her to remember the details and we were to write them down on paper later that night while all was fresh on our minds. We then began pointing out to each other how this airship has no signs of being assembled and riveted. It was so flawless. No signs on it at all of any wear or rust or scratches etc. We were close enough looking right from the back porch tha! t if I had a rock I could have struck it with ease as there wa! s no way I could have missed the monster sized UFO. Imagine a 747 jet shape without any wings or tail or front windows but only gigantic and unpainted. It rose very high and was very round and blimpish. Bare metal in design and showing no rivets whatsoever. Gigantic rectangular windows adorning the side from front to back (which by the way was easily several football fields long or yet longer in length) and there was this greenish/yellowish blurry light in the center section with forms of occupants that were hazily seen because it seemed to make you unable to focus upon them. It made no noise! It hovered over the ocean as if looking for something in the shallow surf with a blinding beam of light that shot out from it&#39;s bottom side. This wide and bright light did not shine outwards but stayed in a curtain like drop from the bottom that lit up the ocean water like the color of a swimming pool looks in lights at night while all surroundings were dark grayish night. It was slowly passin! g by but still right in front of us when I decided to get the car and go down the road towards the end of the island to see it approaching from that view. I left mom by herself on the back porch and grabbed her car keys off a hook on the wall by the front doorway and took her Plymouth Volare without her permission (my car had a weak battery before this)and sped away at at least 80 MPH in the 20 MPH zone to get to the Phelps&#39; pier at the end of Carolina Avenue North. When I got there I slung the  steering wheel a hard right and spun the car around in order to face the still oncoming slow sailing airship that soon would hopefully arrive. This angered some local residents but especially disturbed some tourists who confronted my recklessness from the balconies of some adjacent condos. They began &#34;telling me off&#34; and how they had indeed called the police. The police department was less than a mile away and it would just take minutes to get there. I told them...&#34;Good... we&#39;re gon! na need them!&#34; That comment seemed to scare them as if I had j! ust thre atened them. I recall they had a Queens New York styled or New Jersey type accent/dialect. One particular man in that group asked me why was I acting so strange and what was I trying to accomplish by my odd reckless behavior. I had gotten the car stuck in the sand and had it in a weird position and I now was just standing outside the driver&#39;s side door with my leg inside ready to click the high beams on. I replied...&#34;You&#39;ll see&#34;! He thought I was crazy and my answers were a threat. But I was so focused on trying to locate that UFO thing that nothing bothered me. It was a grayish dark night. The UFO had turned off it&#39;s lights and I could not see it. I walked out to the surf and looked right down the shoreline and it was nowhere to be seen. I was standing there thinking I was about to be arrested or took away to be evaluated when it dawned on me I was looking right at it! From the direct front it was a large circle! It blended in with the sky but was coming onward straight ahe! ad like I hoped it was. I ran to the car and positioned my foot above the high beam switch on the floorboard. That man continued asking me why I doing the things I was and that cops would be here any minute and I knew if I said anything about a UFO that it would only go from bad to worse so I just pointed at the area where it soon would appear and said ...&#34;Just keep lookin&#39; right there fellow!&#34; As it neared I clicked the bright headlights on it. Two small headlight dots appeared upon the giant blimp like structure. They all saw it and began to go insanely frightened and saying all kinds of stuff and it caused me to smirk when they began asking me what it was etc.(As if I knew!)It then slowly swung around and faced me dead straight! It now looked like that circle. It began to hover right over me.I knew I had made this event happen by not minding my own business and it was now hovering at me. At this point I closed my eyes and began to fervently pray!I was so scared that I sm! ashed my face into the sand and was screaming out to God to sa! ve me. I think I repented for things I never did but feared I was perhaps about to die by maybe that light that can come from it&#39;s underside. That man that talked to/at me earlier was saying...&#34;You can come up from there...it&#39;s leaving! It&#39;s backing up man!&#34; But I was too frightened to believe him but he kept insisting it was cool to look up. So when I looked up it was slowly moving backwards just beyond the pier and then it turned so precise and they all saw its huge cigar shape just long enough to get a good mental picture and in just a split second it &#34;blasted&#34; (too slow of a term)away! More screams and explicatives came from the condo balconies and I pointed to the horizon to the left where the night lights of Wrightsville Beach NC were twinkling from and then instantly there in the distance, Wrightsville Beach NC lit up from that UFO&#39;s light beam. After a few minutes the same thing began to repeat itself at Topsail Beach etc. This happened up the North Carolina eastern coastlin! e until it faded like &#34;heat lightning&#34; from our sight. Those people who were angered at me...well they helped me get out of the sand and I went back home never once encountering an officer of the law kind! When I returned home my mom gave me an earful for leaving her alone and taking her car but then said that the local news was going to carry the story at 11:00 PM which was just coming up. In a brief report by a girl who&#39;s first name was Michelle, they mentioned that the UFO sightings being called in was nothing more than a &#34;Coast Guard Drug Surveillance Vehicle&#34; ! (I later asked the local news station for a copy of that broadcast and they told me that they don&#39;t archive news broadcasts). My mom and I both that very night had drawn our pictures of the craft and wrote out our affidavits about our encounter and put them in a separate file among the important paperworks stored in a special closet. Later that year we had to move and that particular paperwork was all we found missing! Many years went by and I&#39;ve told this event to hundreds of listeners. I once told a retired Air Force officer and he cussed me out and told me that I had better keep my @#$%% mouth shut if I knew what was good for me. He continued cussing me out until I was red faced and hot under the collar and he drove off down the wrong side of the highway pulled over at a nearby phone booth and made a phone call. My wife was disturbed and asked me to quit telling others. Later that night when we got home, we found someone had entered our home with no sign of breaking in. We never found anything out of place except that someone had entered the house and installed a new cartridge of ink in our printer and used over half of it. It&#39;s like they wanted us to know it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The strangest part of my encounter is that it was not late and had not been dark very long when I laid back to play my guitar. But when I returned home it was almost eleven o&#39; clock. I was not abducted. I did not recall anything longer than perhaps thirty minutes time taking place. That missing time thing has bothered me. And those people on the balconies may have took photos. They had a lot of time to do that. And the police never showed up. And the TV station constantly shows archived footages of old news.<n> <n><n> <n><n> If I&#39;m sounding somewhat paranoid then it&#39;s only because I have what I consider to be good valid reasons.<n> <n><n> <n><n> And to make it even weirder is that in the very same location where the UFO was first encountered, me and my brother-in-law both watched the figure of a person come out of the surf there one night in what seemed like gray flannel attire compete with a hood that covered the head and although it should have been dripping wet it&#39;s attire was completely dry and flapping in the wind and then it just vaporized in front of us! For readers this is the 800 block of Carolina Avenue North.<n> <n><n> <n><n> OK Carolina Beach people in April of &#39;87... you remember this!! Who could ever forget?! Back me up on this!<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))<n>

It was a clear Friday before Easter Sunday in 1987.  Looking up into the northeast sky, about 5 miles away and perhaps 5000 to 10000 feet above the ground, we noticed approximately a dozen objects slowly moving south.  They had a metallic shimmer in the sunlight and made no noise.  The objects &#34;faded in and out&#34; in unison as they flew across the sky in what appeared to be a square or diamond formation (from our perspective).  We were able to observe this phenomenon for about 10 minutes (our lunch period had ended), durning which this formation of objects moved from the northern sky to the sky just south of us.<n>

For 24 years I kept this to myself and for some reason I really want to report it now. - I try to be percise but this gets a little in depth, since I saw it twice.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In 1987, while returning home, I spotted what I (now)believe to be an Event Horizon, approx 1ft in diameter, gliding next to the road approx 3 ft from the ground and 1ft from the road edge (Union st. 200yd east of N. highland Ave).  At first I believed the object was a smoke ring.  I was not on drugs or alcohol, but for some reason my thinking was and my reactions were slow, I had actually passed the object before the (for lack of a better term)  Wrongness of it registered.  There were no cars for it to have come from and it was not dissapating.  So I turned around and went back to look at it more closely.  I was about 2 ft from it when I realized it was no longer moving down the road, It had stopped moving and the circular formation of it was now directly facing me (I never saw it turn, it was facing me when I turned about).  It appeared to be a Haze, like vapor between glass panes.  I stared at it for about 30secs before I suddenly believed it was a reflection off my contacts.  I turned walked about 2 steps before I stopped myself.  I Have never seen a contact reflection and the object didnt move with my eyes.  So I turned and walked back to it.  It was still right where it had been.  I decided to touch it. I had just started to move my hand twards it, when I suddenly thought how uniportant it was, turned walked home. Sat in a chair turned on the TV and just watched my normal shows for about 15 minutes, when I suddenly stood and remembered what I had just seen.  I had no explaination for why I had suddenly forgotten the object walked away and continued on like I hadn&#39;t observed it.  I kinda believed I must have daydreamed it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> But in June of 87 I saw it again. I was biking home from a friends house, when I came to the SE corner of Sunset Poind rd. and N.Belcher Dr.   When I saw it again.  It was the same size, the same distance off the ground, and the same distance from the road approx 20ft from the NW corner of the intersection.  I crossed N. Belcher and the Sunset Point Road.  I had no sooner hit the NW corner of the intersection ( determined to find out once and for all what this thing was). The next thing I knew I was fleeing up Sunset Point Road.  I was in full tilt running for my life mode, Run was all I could think of. Then I stopped.  The fear just went away.  I was on Peppermill dr and Sunset point road, and I just sat there stunned.  I did not go back.  I went home.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have never seen the object since that day.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I do not know why after 24 years Im now reporting this.  Its been on my mind alot lately, which is strange since I barely spared it a thought for 20+ years.  I have no doubts about the accuracy of the events, just the dates are approximations. If this isnt the appropriate agency please forward it to the proper one.<n>

I still don&#39;t know why I suddenly had the urge to turn and take a picture due south as there wasn&#39;t anything there we could use in our work.  When the slide was processed and I looked at it through an eye loop, I saw the UFO just  above the horizon just right of center.  I have been a professional pilot for many years and knew it wasn&#39;t an airplane.  A close friend who sold million dollar photo and printing eguipment, sent the slide to Kodak labs--the ones that do work for the FBI to have it analyzed to see if it was an error on the film.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Their report said it was something in the air flying at tremdous speed.  In the enlargement you can see by the light it was really moving.  My logs showed I was using 25 ASA film and shot the picture at F4 at 1000th of a second.  We have since seen other UFO&#39;s but have not gotten photos of them.  Being a long time pilot, I&#39;m always looking up to the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((FOLLOW-UP CORRESPONDENCE WITH WITNESS))<n> <n><n> <n><n> Dear Mr. ((name deleted)),<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thank you very much for the report, and for the photographs.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It is very difficult to establish what the light is in the photo.  Given that it is not possible to know its distance from the camera, facts such as the object&#39;s size, velocity, etc., are all not able to be calculated, in my opinion.  I do not know how even Kodak would have been able to determine that the object was moving at a high velocity.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Hence, given the information available to us from your report, the object remains just an unidentified light, to the best of my knowledge.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Did you note the object at the time of your sighting, or see it later while examining your photos.  Also, was your camera on a tripod, at the time of the shot?<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thanks, again, for sharing the information with our Center!<n> <n><n> <n><n> Cordially,<n> <n><n> <n><n> Peter Davenport<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((RESPONSE FROM WITNESS))<n> <n><n> <n><n> Yes, it was on a tripod. When I took the picture I was unaware of the<n> <n><n> object.  Kodak measured the light trail and compared it with known flying or<n> <n><n> moving objects.  This was not the regular Kodak lab that you have access to.<n> <n><n> I have in many years of flying all over the world seen many other flying<n> <n><n> objects and about 6 years ago I was driving into town and saw a bright red<n> <n><n> orb that I felt was over the area of my house.  At this time the cloud layer was about a thousand feet and decending as it ofthen does here in the valley. I was five miles away and having flown thosands of hours I&#39;m a pretty good judge of where things in the air are around here.  I called my wife and she went outside and saw it several hundred yards from our house over new construction on the I-5 freeway.  When I got home it was still hovering in place below the cloud layer.  About twenty people were outside<n> <n><n> watching it.  It was bright red, the light coming from within.  It did not pulse, just glowed.  I called the tower chief at the airport 2 miles away.  The cloud base was 300 feet.  As I pulled off the freeway going north at Market street it was directly ahead of me over the roadway.  When I got home it was directly east of my house. Allowing me to see it from three sides. It stayed there for another half an hour for a total time since I saw it of about 45 minutes.  It appeared to be about the size of a large auto.  It did not fly away, it just seemed to implode into itself. No noise. Just hovered there.  I have seen enough of them in my 56 years to not be bothered by them, I just assume they&#39;re here and have been here for thosands of years.  The first one I saw was about twenty miles south of here in 1956.  It flew<n> <n><n> over our farm at slow speed.  The newspaper said it was seen all over Oregon that night. ((NAME DELETED)).  P.S for many years I flew at least 4 days a week at night.  You see many things flying over the mountains around here at night.  If you need names of others who saw the red orb over the freeway, just ask.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((END CORRESPONDENCE))<n>

It hovered for a few seconds, then as if it saw me looking at it, it went straight for me, across the roads, through a fence, as I saw this, the wood from the fence glowed. The light was so bright, that I had to look away from the window. It then disapeared, and I spent the rest of the night terrified on my bed. This happened to me 23 years ago, and I have never, ever forgotten, even the smallest detail, and the fright i had. It was not a fast moving car with its highbeams on, there was no car there at the time i saw what i saw. This was not a dream. What i state i saw, really happened. I did not see aliens, all i saw was what appeared to be a flying object, that was surrounded by an emence, expanding light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date may be approximate, although the witness does not indicate that fact.

It looked like something you would see on the hood of a 1923 packard!  It looked like a JET, but the wings came STRAIGHT OUT and STRAIGHT BACK.  The wing tip&#39;s did not extend beyond the end of the craft, but fell short.  Further, There were NO rear flaps, and the entire craft was no more than 3&#39; long.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.  PD))<n>

A famous actor purchased the property and had the old beach home demolished and built a new home there.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I believe my sighting took place around the eleventh of April,1987 but I&#39;m not certain as to that exact date.  However I am certain of the following.<n> <n><n> <n><n> While I was admiring the beautiful ocean scenery from the back porch facing the ocean ,I saw a UFO.It just appeared before my eyes.It did not merely just sail in from some perimeter.It manifested instantly.It was a fairly dark night and this tubular shaped UFO was very large.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This also was a very up close encounter.I called for my son and after several emotional outcries he finally responded by rushing out to the back porch.He still is very haunted by the memory.I too have no equal experience to diminish this.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As far as features go,there were no signs on this craft revealing it being assembled by the usually standardized fabrications we see in aircraft such as rivetings or weldings or paint.However there were metallic trims around the many windows that adorned this airship from front to back that seemed to be the only thing I could define as perhaps seeming &#34;natural&#34; to my eyes.It was raw metallic and flawless in it&#39;s design.It had semblance to a blimp but however this was a colossus that stretched several hundred yards in lenghth and had no carriage or motor housings.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It made no noise that I might discriminate and the ocean was relativity quiet. A brilliant ray-beam of light emitted from the entire bottom side.My son left in my car to go in pursuit of this craft as I watched it slowly travel left to points ahead.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A short time later at 11:00 PM the local news media reported that the Coast Guard Auxiliary Station at Carolina Beach, N.C. issued a statement that the UFO being reported by people all up and down the Eastern Seaboard was nothing more than just their drug surveillance vehicle.Me and my son began to laugh.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was the one time we could as that UFO was and still remains to this day the most spellbinding encounter to date.<n> <n><n> <n><n> He posted his post about this years ago on this website and no one has backed him up as he asked for.Well here is my account.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date is approximate.

4/10/87 13:00|New York City (Manhattan)|NY|Triangle|unknown|Trianglar Dream sightings|3/23/04|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/035/S35666.html|15|ndxe198704| Trianglar Dream sightings<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is not a visual sighting of a UFO. As far back as I can remember since I was 7 years old (this is before Aliens became pop culture and ufo images were casted into our minds) I&#39;ve kept having reoccuring dreams of a Trianglar shape aircraft hovering over me. The craft had blue lights at each corner (as far as I can remember) and a srobe light directly in the middle of the this craft that was always shining on me. I may have had this dream more than 10 times through out my childhood from 7-15 years old. After looking at some depictions (graphics) on your site showing these similar crafts, I felt sick to my stomach. I don&#39;t know why I was giving those dreams, and could never find any source of dream sightings. I must clearify that I never physically seen this object while awake, only in my dreams when I was a kid. I&#39;m now 27 years old and still can remember them clearly. I was told by a family memeber whom also had these dream sightings that he feels that these objects are monitoring us. I feel something sinister is present every time of those dreams. Please help me to understand them, even if it means a hyptnosis session. I&#39;m ready to know the truth. Thank You for this opportunity.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

Most likely the bottom of the ship or objects body.|6/9/09|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/070/S70240.html|16|ndxe198704| Four octagon shape pods hooked together with pulsating lights. Most likely the bottom of the ship or objects body.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My friend and I were driving to the Quakerbridge mall in my sisters Datsun 280zx on RT. I-95 going east. My sisters car has a moon roof. I was gazing out through the moon roof noticing the slight fog in the air as I was driving and noticed two lighted objects appear side by side. It looked as if they were coming towards us but being that we were driving in that direction probably made it look that way. I quickly called to my friend and told him to look up, do you see what I see? he said yes, what is it? One of the objects hovered above us and followed in our direction as the other one had seemed to stay behind. I immediately noticed the shape and lights. There were what seemd to be four octagon pods hooked together with a honey comb shape screen or lens and the lights slowly pulsated in each pod, white, red, blue and maybe orange?? Driving at 60mph I slowed down and pulled the car over to the side of the road so we could get out to get a better look at the object. As we looked up into the foggy air, we could not see the object. We got back in the car and drove on to the next exit ( Trenton, New Brunswick ) As we took the New brunswick exit toward the mall, we had to stop at the next red traffic light. The New Jersey motor vehicles inspection station is on the right. As we were waiting for the light to turn green, I looked up into the fog and there it was, right above us, that same pulsating octagon object. I jestured for my friend to look up and we watched it slowly ascend into the foggy air and then nothing, it was gone. The light turned green and we went on our way asking each other what the hell did we just see? The strange thing about this experience was that it did not creep us out or make us scared. It was like, oh whats that? and then hmmm, life goes on. I do have to say I have always been intrigued by stories of UFO&#39;s ever since i was eleven years old. I loved watching old saucer movies and reading books on the subject, but never would I have imagined that oneday I would get to w! itness o ne?? I am now a deffinet believer in UFO&#39;s. Something is deffinetly out there and probably has been for years.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It came closer and closer it was about 60 feet above the trees.  It was totally silent, all I could hear was the wind.  It was a solid object because I couldn&#39;t see the stars behind it.  It was as big as 2 football fields at i realized it&#39;s going to hover right over me what the hell do I do? I just stood there in disbelief.  I looked closely to see any markings, but I couldn&#39;t see anything.  I thought about shooting at it with my dad&#39;s shotgun but I decided that would be bad no matter what planet here or there.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I watched it float to the east right over highway 53 till it went out of sight. !
