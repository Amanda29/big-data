The reflection the object made is what drew our attention. Jet aircraft appeared and object dissapeard from sight. This was a long time ago, but you do not forget these things. This object was far from being an annomily. This is late in coming, but a true report never the less.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.

It very much resembled a drone vehicle of about 100 feet in dimeter programed to maintain a mean ground or terrain following low  altitude of about 500 to 1000 feet above ground level.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was observed for only about 4 seconds and moving in a straight line north to south coarse at about 650 to 700 MPH.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Discription of Frontial view: symetrical ovel bubble shape of top and bottom within the center sectiom comprising about 25 percent of its diameter. An outer faired ring section with a smooth symetrical straight line tapor running from the thickened center section to almost a knife edge at the outer periphery comprizing about 75 percent of the vehicle.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Discription of bottom view. The ovel center section was clearly stationary (not revolving) while the outer ring section was clearly revolving at a high speed around it with no gap visible but a definite line of seperation. The colors were mostly bright white like a glowing light bulb comprising all of the center section running into about 10 percent of the revolving ring and transisting from white to orange and then reds at the outer periphery. There was a bright thick and continuous blue electrical arc surrounding but not touching the outer peripherial edge that was giving off a stream of orange / white sparks.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Some of my background: At the time of the sighting (1951) I was 19 years old, sitting in a convertable car with the top down and with a girl friend in her drive way and the car facing north. I was working then as an engine build-up mechanic for the Flying Tiger Line at their main base in Burbank Airport. Sense then I have worked for many companies within the Aerospace industry, retiring as a Project Assembly Tool Engineer. I have seen High speed aircraft flying just off the groung and overhead at just under mach 1. I have seen things happen in slow motion and reacted at a suprisingly high speed when jolted with an emergency adrenaline rush resulting in much detail being acquired within a second or two. Also I have not reported this before now because during the time I had seen the object I had told several people who I worked with and was laughed at and kidded for some time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.
