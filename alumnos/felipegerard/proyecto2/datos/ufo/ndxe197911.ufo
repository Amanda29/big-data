Jackson S.C.  A-12-4.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I and another soldier were on guard duty at an ammo dump. I was walking ten paces ahead of him (according the rules of patrolling) on the left side of the raised dump mound, as we both became aware of a light flashing in the sky.  It was lighting up the whole area, and seemed to be happening in regular intervals, about 15 seconds apart.  After a few flashes, although I couldn&#39;t tell of its origin, I could somehow sense the direction from which it came.  I sped up my pace to get to the far end of the mound, so I could better see where it was coming from.  When I got to the end of the  mound, I looked up at the sky in that direction.  It was a beautiful clear night, you could see forever, but one star seemed to stand out.  It seemed to have a bit of a green tint to it, otherwise it looked like all the other stars.  Then it flashed. I can only describe it as looking like a giant flash cube.  It lit up the whole area. Then it turned red and streaked across the sky, within a second it was out of sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I freaked out, not being able to believe what I had just witnesed.  The soldier who was behind me didn&#39;t see it take off but he saw my reaction to it.  By that time &#34;to hell with the rules&#34; we were walking side by side like a couple of scared little kids, as I was telling him what I saw in every detail, when the area lit up again.  We stood there breathless, crouched down watching this thing do just as it had done before.  It lit up the entire area about 5 or 6 times in about 15 second intervals, turned red and streaked back across the sky, gone in a second.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Another soldier who was in the guard shack saw the flashing but didn&#39;t see where it came from.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We did report the incident, but it wasn&#39;t taken seriously, we were laughed at.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The 1st duty station I was assigned to after training happened to be on a missile range. I was privy to see at that time what was the fastest flying missiles in the US Arsenal. Nothing I ever saw could even compair to what we saw that day in South Carolina.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

When the light went off, oh my God.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was off duty in November, 1979, deer season, working as an undercover vice officer.  I was traveling from a friends house and we spotted a small light on top of the hill above her house moving back and forth across the ridge.  We watched the light for almost two hours.  It went or traveled back and forth and up and down in a very slow fashion.<n> <n><n> <n><n> An airplane started toward the craft and the unidentified object shut down the light and to our amazement the craft became very visible and moved very swiftly over our heads away from the oncoming airplane.  The craft was huge, you could observe the indentures of the giant steel structure pausing over our heads.  I would estimate that the craft was larger then thrre football fields combined or larger.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The plane came closer and the craft took off in a southern direction faster than the speed of light. Their was no engine noise. You could see the craft fly out of sight for miles as a big black machine in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I called the airport and advised them I f they had any reports of a UFO and they denied any planes being in the area.<n>

As I drove eastward toward Detroit Metro Airport, object stayed in upper quadrant of windshield.  As I stopped for traffic light at the intersesction of Wick and Middlebelt Roads, object stopped. I obserbed object through bare branches of a large tree across the intersection.  As light changed to green, I proceeded through the intersection. A smaller bright disc-shaped object separated from the larger disc.  Smaller disc proceeded due south at a very high rate of speed while the larger object changed to a southeasterly direction.  I soon lost the object in the sun which by now had topped the trees in the area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A co-worker had also seen the same objects at the same intersection.  She was two cars behind me.  The object had to pass directly over Detroit Metro Airport, yet no story ever appeared on any news broadcast!<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

We drove back roads through Sharon, Amenia Union and Amenia/ Millerton area.  At some point this object would meet us and follow and play with us as we drove to work.  The craft would parallel our car, stop when we did, cross over the top of the car stopping when we did and waiting for, it had intention.  The light was often waiting after ((name deleted--witness #2)) picked me ((up)) near the power plant at the bottom of the falls in Fall Village, Connecticut. For weeks and seemed follow/paralleled our car with intention, when we stopped at the 7/11 like store it would disappear and return.  One evening it followed us closely to the turn off to the center complex.  It hovered very close above a high tree for at least several minutes.  It crossed over the top of our car, it shot up straight and appeared to be circular with the circles or outlines changing shape as the colors changed.  It moved staright up, I think we watched it for a few more minutes before we went to work.  I remember being terrified and ((name deleted--witness #2)) assuring me it was okay, that they were friendly.  She was insistent of there friendliness as I was terrified.  We went to work and I told others at work about it.  I also called the State police and asked if there had been any reports.  It would be almost impossible to have been working the 11:00 - 7:00 shift and not seen this huge glowing object at the bottom of the road or driveway.  Many cars were pulled over and were watching.  Most recently I read a book about the Gulf Breeze Sightings, I think the craft I saw was similar to the craft and rings of lights in some of the photos noted.  I have also felt compelled in the past year or so to seek out others who may refute or confirm this incident.  There were many vehicles parked at the driveway to Wasaiic Developmental Center that evening.  I believe this incident occured! in the fall or earl spring.  We also saw this craft for miles along the back roads between Falls Village and Wasaiic.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date of incident is approximate.  Ordinarily, the first possibility to be ruled out in a case like this, in which a night-time light is perceived to be &#34;following&#34; a moving vehicle, a celestial body is the first possibility that has to be ruled out.  However, in this case, if in fact the object flew over the vehicle, a celestial body seems unlikely to us.  PD))<n>

They were finished and were &#34;cooling down&#34; outside on the balcony during the mid evening hours on a Satuday nite and the four of them were having refreshments to rehydrate and rest from the broiling sauna-The Finns like it hot!-<n> <n><n> <n><n> one of my buddies looks up into the clear starry night and gets the other 3 to also see a series of red lights moving around straight overhead at above 1000 feet in altitude and watch as the the lights maneuver  around changing patterns in a formation of sorts.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They described the event to me minutes after it happened. The pattern was at first a shifting kite/diamond shape directly overhead that reorganized into a horseshoe pattern of red lights and sped/zipped to the horizon at high speed. They did not discern a solid shape or hull of a craft only the red lights changing patterns and departing at a phenomenal speed - one second or two to get to the horizon and out of sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> No prank was played on me as the four buddies were missionaries for the church and no one gave the slightest hint of this being a joke on me. They drew on paper the light patterns and said that they behaved like separate objects rather than off and on lights attached to a single craft or hull because of the jigglly positioning or jockeying the lights did when changing from the kite shape outline formation to the horseshoe formation. Then they departed in a locked in formation as &#34;one&#34; entity.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This event was quite possibly recorded in one to four journals as we each kept a journal of our stay in Finland.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date of event may be approximate, although the witness does not indicate that fact.

There, hovering above the UT Tower was a triangular shaped craft aprox. 100 yards in length with amber colored glowing half-bulbs at each corner underside of the craft. It made no noise and hovered for about 20-30 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Everyone on the street saw it and we all pointed at it. I was very excited and the feeling I had was one of pure elation.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object moved silently towards the south and downtown area of Austin and then seemed to accelerate and was out of sight within a fraction of a second.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The next day on the local rock radio station KLBJ, they announced that if anyone had seen anything unusual the night before it was because the Air Force was testing something.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I later became a weather technician for the Texas Air Guard and even though I was already familiar with most military craft I became an expert at recognizing all atmospheric phenomena and different types of aircraft as was required by my job.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I do not believe nor have I ever believed that this huge, silent golden triangle was of a terran origin. I have only found one other witness online to this event who saw it 30 miles to the north of Austin and he stated that he saw several small shapes flying around the triangle as it headed south towards the Austin area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of sighting is approximate.

Shasta, south towards Redding<n> <n><n> <n><n> On or about the 14th of November 1979, my friend Vic and I were headed towards Susanville from Medford Oregon, on our way to Reno (Vic had a job interview), it was around 10pm.. Vic had a convertable and it was an unusually warm evening so we had the top down... In the area of Hat Creek Campground, on Highway 89, I was leaning back with my head on the back of the front seat when I saw a HUGE object moving diagonally over the highway above us.. I was saying Oh my God, and Vic was trying to see what I was looking at while trying to keep the car on the road.. When he realized what I was looking, he immediately pulled over to the side of the road.. For about a half a minute we watched it fly over the woods to our right, and almost out of sight, so Vic said &#34;Let&#39;s follow it&#34;.. We found a logging road and drove up until we reached the edge of a canyon..We sat on the top of the back of the front seats and just watched the huge, silent, rectangular object with lights that went all all around the edge of it, (I can&#39;t remember if they were in color).. When we realized that if we could see them, then they could see us, we decided to leave the area...It was the most amazing thing I have ever seen in my life.. I never reported this to anyone of authority for obvious reasons.. ((Name deleted))Medford Oregon<n>

Our group was about 6 people, all of us saw something a little different, but it was one light, couldent tell how far. Bouncing up and down side to side. At least 50 other people pulled over saw the light. It went from being orangeish, to greenish, to coming close and being more silver. Another person with us says they thought it was white the hole time. It seemed as if it was following us for 45-50 miles, it would stay parallel to us the hole time, eathier following us, or very far away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We would welcome reports from the other witnesses.

Appeared long, tube shaped, like a paper towel tube. Brightness changed every 30 seconds or so. Appeared to be rotating slowly, possibly tumbling. NOTE: This object was DIRECTLY overhead. I observed it for two nights through a small telescope. My neighbor inquired about what I was doing. I pointed out the object. We then used his more powerful binoculars. The object was a single color (as like just plain metal, no lights, etc.). The third night we were again observing it when several small flashes appeared underneath it. About 5 minutes later, a silver ball shaped object dropped straight down through the broken clouds, executed a right angle turn and moved off to the east. The second ball moved to the north-east, the third and fourth to the south.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It is interesting to note that I was able to train the binoculars on one of the balls. It looked like a ball bearing or a pinball machine ball, chrome-like, no lights, window or other variations on the surface. I observed it going through clouds, leaving a trail of water vapor. The ground was covered with snow and the night was clear, so observation was about as perfect as it could be. My guess is around mach 1 with no sound or sonic boom.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My neighbor said he would contact the Air Force. He was in his 40s, I in my late teens, so that seemed logical. I didn&#39;t see him for a few days. When I did, I inquired about whether or not he called anyone. He stated firmly that he never saw anything and neither did I. The interesting thing to note is that my neighbor was a &#34;&#39;60s liberal&#34;, i.e. antiestablishment, VW bus, peace protester, demand answers from the government kind of guy.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

After we tired ourselves out they went into the house, I stayed outside to sit on a front lawn chair facing east.<n> <n><n> <n><n> While there I glanced up and saw this triangle craft moving silently with what looked like port holes on each corner and some kind of circle dome in the center. It moved like a boat swaying back and forth on water. Heading west very slowly with no lights on. I watched it for about a minute or more it seems because I thought there was something wrong with it, like it might crash.  The city lights lit up the under side of it because I saw it in very good detail. ( may have been 2000 to 3000 feet up). I got excited and ran into the house to tell everyone that there is a UFO flying over and must come out to see. But they all laughed saying there is no such thing. I went back out to look for it but didnt see it, and then a few seconds later a Helicopter appears and is flying around lower than the triangle, shining its spot light on the ground. I thought to myself, this is all too weird and was time for me to go back into the house.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>
11/1/79 16:30|Meriden|CT|Light|2mins|I was 14 years old and lived at Sidehill Rd.I had just finished supper and decided to go up the street to my friends house at the top o|9/2/05|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/045/S45642.html|18|ndxe197911| I was 14 years old and lived at Sidehill Rd.I had just finished supper and decided to go up the street to my friends house at the top of Sidehill road and Keats road to shoot some basketball at my friends house.The sun had just gone down when I knocked on my friends front door to see if he and his brother would like to come out and shoot some baskets.He answered they had just finished supper and had a few chores to do and would be out in a little while.So I walked across the front yard towards the west where the hoop was and started shooting some baskets for about 10 minutes.I then turned towards the east and watched two incredibly bright red circular objects I should say lights rise up from behind the tree line below where I was standing which is River road at an incredible speed.Within one to two seconds the two objects darted straight up from behind the trees and  were I would guess 1,500 to 2000 ft in the sky  and stop instantaneously and sat there stationary.Mind you this first part of this event took no more than two seconds.I would like to add there was absolutely no sound.I stood in awe for a good 10 seconds looking up at these two bright red objects side by side.I then turned to my left and ran towards the front door of my friends house and proceeded to pound on the front storm door all the while turning to look at the two objects.My friend comes to the door saying what the hell is your problem at this point im very excited yelling and pointing saying look look  theres a  bleeping  ufo as my friend just laughs I jump back down the steps pointing towards the objects as he then steps outside and down the steps and says holy bleep.At this point my adrenalin is pumping and I`m jumping up and down and run to the top of Sidehill road where it meants Keats Rd.I must say  something inside told me not to go any closer so I stopped.I then turned to see where my friend was he had stopped at the edge of his yard and I must say he looked a little scared.He then yelled out I gotta go get my brother.I must say at this point I had tunnel vision I was viewing the objects  that were a little to the left and above holy angels church s field.What transpired next is unexplainable. Why I say this is there is no aircraft then or now that could duplicate what unfolded next.The two brillantly red circlular objects appeared to start to vibrate then its hard to explain they started jumping all over the sky back and forth up and down around each other in circles at incredible speeds then as fast as it started they stopped in a blink of an eye side by side just as they had when they rose up from behind the trees.Again I must say there was absolutely no sound while this is going on.As I said earlier no manmade object could duplicate what I witnessed.Then the object on the left started to vibrate again and went from a brillant red to a shimmering orange. I would say the change from red to orange took about 10 seconds and then the object shot straight up into the sky and was gone in one second.Then the 2nd object repeated the same process but didnt go to a brillant orange just a dull orange then it went back to a brillant red and shot at incredible speed climbing into the southeastern sky then stop on a dime. I would have to say at this point it was over 10,000 ft in the air.It then dropped back down a little bit and shot down towards South Meridens markham airport below.I must say I am almost 40 yrs old and I can still see the event as it happened yesterday.The only thing I`m a little fuzzing on is the exact day on which it took place.I do recall that we ran down to my house at the bottom of Sidehill road  all excited telling my parents and their friends what had just happened so they let us call the police station and the local news station to report it.As you can imagine the people on the other end of the phoneline just laughed at me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.

11/1/79 13:30|Wausau/Shawno (between)|WI|Formation|5 minutes|3 stationary lights forming a triangle which then joined and moved upward at a high rate of speed|10/30/06|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/052/S52090.html|19|ndxe197911| 3 stationary lights forming a triangle which then joined and moved upward at a high rate of speed<n> <n><n> <n><n> While driving back from an engagement (we were musicians) I noticed three stationary bright lights in the sky. These three lights appeared circular, were somewhat hazy and formed a triangle with the shape on top being the brightest. My best recollection is that it was yellowish and the two smaller objects were bluish and reddish. They were clearly too close to be planets or stars. I didn&#39;t mention what I was seeing to the driver and 2 other passengers in the back were sleeping. After a few minutes the driver, who had also been watching this event asked me what I thought it was. I acknowledged that I had been watching it and said I really had no idea. We both agreed that it was stationary and close. After a few minutes of watching this together and theorizing what we thought it could be, the bluish and reddish objects simultaneously each moved up, swung up above the yellow object and then appeared to either meet it or enter it. Immediately after this the yellow object headed up at a rate of speed that was stunning and disappeared. It left no trail of light of any kind. The driver and I expressed our amazement to each other, then woke the others to let them know what we had witnessed. They were doubtful but we were 100% sure that what we had seen seemed to defy any explanation we were capable of making.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.
