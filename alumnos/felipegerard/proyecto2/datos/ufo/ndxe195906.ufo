I knew then it wasn&#39;t normal.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I called my mother the sound in my voice brought her fast.

It was a bright white glow which appeared to be multiple lights with no colored lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The speed and abrupt movement was nothing like I’d ever seen.  We were used to seeing and hearing jets in and around Phoenix but never at night.  Jets frequently broke the sound barrier over Phoenix during that time so we were used to seeing them and this was not one of them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There were 9 of us in the car.  My two parents and I were in the front seat and my 3 brothers and 3 sisters in the back seat.  My two parents and I saw it clearly for the duration of the event which lasted less than one minute or half a minute.  Four siblings saw the event and the other 3 were sleeping. It had to have been a weekend day because my parents would not have had us out that late on a week night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was much commotion in the car and my parents, who were normally calm and serious, sounded alarmed and scared, which scared me.  The term UFO was not used; we all used the term &#34;flying saucer&#34; to describe it.  My father abruptly told all of us that we were never to speak of this again because the child welfare people would think they were crazy and unfit parents and take us away.  We never reported the incident to anyone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I mentioned it to my parents several years later in the 1980s and they both remembered the incident vividly.  In February 2009 all of my siblings were together and I asked if any of them remembered the incident and all four of them that witnessed it remembered the event.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My parents are now deceased but all siblings are living.    Phoenix was a really small town back then.  South Mountain was a nice area, not a slum like today.  There were radio towers on top of the mountain.  From the top of South Mountain you can see all of Phoenix as well as Luke Air Force Base and Sky Harbor Airport (which was very small back then).<n> <n><n> <n><n> I’m reporting it now because I thought there should be some record of the incident for posterity.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date in 1959.

6/30/59 20:00|New York City (Bronx)|NY|Oval|Approx. 1/2 hr.|My husband and I didn't believe in UFO's until we actually saw one!|7/19/10|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/076/S76504.html|3|ndxe195906| My husband and I didn&#39;t believe in UFO&#39;s until we actually saw one!<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was a warm summer evening, around 7:30 P.M.  My husband was home and my babies were in their cribs sleeping.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I went to the bathroom window to remove my clothes off the clothesline.  I had to stand on the edge of the tub to take in my clothes, and in the far off skyline, I noticed a very large orange sun which meant it was going to be very hot the next day.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I stopped what I was doing and looked at the sky, and  admired it.  Often in the daytime, when hanging out my clothes, when it was clear out, I could actually see the top of the Empire State Bldg.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Anyway, as I looked at the skyline, I noticed blinking lights, and the object was zig zagging coming closer and closer.  It was quite far away, so it was small, and the closer it got, the more curious I became.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I went into the hallway of our apartment building and went up to the roof.  As I watched the object get closer and closer, I called out to my husband and he came up to the roof.  As the object came closer, we could see it was silver and it looked like there were lights of different colors going round and round, like the top of a police vehicles light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I ran down and got my neighbor and she came up and we looked up in the sky.  As the object approached us, it kind of tilted and it then looked like a round shaped disk, and the sound it emitted was a swishing sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It cam around and went to the left of  us, and it stopped.  When it stopped, the swishing sound stopped and their was a humming sound like a motor.  I noticed windows in the center of the object, and what we thought were different colored panes, was instead, there was some sort of lights changing colors and it was rotating inside of the craft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We noticed then two rods, on each end of the craft.  They were facing downwards.  We looked up mesmerized and we asked each other if we could figure out what it was, and we were just dumfounded.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After what seemed like 10 or 15 mins. the rods disappeared and the object which had become an oval shape took off zig zagging and wit! hin seconds it disappeared from sight.  When the object took off, the motor stopped and there was a swishing sound.  We were dumbfounded.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We went down to our apartment, my neighbor who didn&#39;t speak English, but Italian, I spoke with her as that is my language and she said she never saw anything like it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My husband went into one room and I in another and we both drew what we saw.  We drew the identical thing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We decided to call the Civil Aironautics Bureau, and they kept me on the phone about an hour asking me questions.  They asked me not to call the newspapers or the radio media.  We didn&#39;t call anyone else nor did we tell anyone else.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The very next day, we looked in the newspaper to see if there was any article of what we saw the evening before and there was none.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We we eventually moved away to upstate N.Y.  This was in 1963.  After living there awhile, one evening we watched T.V. and saw a program which showed a couple who claimed to be abducted on board a UFO, and they had been hypnotised and they described the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We could hardly believe our eyes when we saw the same object we had seen that evening in the Bronx.  We then knew we had seen something that was from outer space, a UFO.<n> <n><n> <n><n> From then on, I know in my heart that there are space vehicles of other planets.  I no longer feel those who  report UFO sightings that they are imagining or not being truthful.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thank God my husband had been home that evening and saw what I did, for it he wasn&#39;t there, he wouldn&#39;t have believed me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is the truth, and even though it was a very long time ago, it is something I will never forget.<n> <n><n> <n><n> One more thing, when the object took off, it went into the direction of Orchard Beach.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

Two lights collide/merge and debris found the next day.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This information was just told to me by my Father (81 years old).  Sometime in the summer(?) of 1959 one night between 2200 and 2300 hours, my Dad, Mom, two older sisters and a family friend, saw two large lights in the sky over Putnam County, West Virginia.  The two large lights came from opposite directions (one from the east and one from the west) they appeared to collide or merge into one very large light and then disappear.  The next day debris was found over some of the hills and fields throughout the county. Dad said that the Charleston Gazette carried stories about it, but he couldn&#39;t remember what the paper said it was.  My two sisters were 11 and 12 at the time.  Also some the the woods and fields had a purple substance coating the grass and trees.  Everyone just assumed it was all military related.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

6/15/59 01:00|Missoula (event at Superior)|MT|Unknown|20 consec nights|Twenty nights of stalking, apparent abduction attempts by Grey "alien" creatures, 1959.|6/6/00|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/012/S12995.html|12|ndxe195906| Twenty nights of stalking, apparent abduction attempts by Grey &#34;alien&#34; creatures, 1959.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;ve never seen a UFO, but may have one better than that.  In 1959 I was visiting my grandfather at his house on the mountainous outskirts of Superior, Montana (this was the old railroad signal maintainer&#39;s house).  I made this visit every summer for 2 weeks - in this case I stayed three weeks, but for the last time.  The 1st or 2nd morning I awoke early and noticed that the bedroom door was ajar an inch.  But this was impossible as my grandfather was religious about closing and locking doors, especially at night.  Nor was there any possible way anyone could have gotten into the house. So I kept myself awake all the next night, and, oddly, the door did pop open roughly after midnight.  It also appeared that the hall light was on, because I could easily see the light from the opened door.  But the door did not open much more than an inch, unless, that is, I was extremely still and relaxed over several minutes, then it would gently open to 4-6 inches.  If I allowed myself to approach sleep, but not quite, 6 inches could be pretty well assured.  During all this, my grandfather slept in the same bed between myself and the door.  He had a bad case of apnea and made thunderous snoring noises and had violent nightmares all night. After about six nights, I asked him if we could swap - this would put my head only about 3 feet from the door and facing just a little into the hall.  Still, I could see very little all night and the door never opened over about 4 inches.  Finally, I coaxed myself into a half-sleep, a drifting sort of awareness and readiness to prod myself into a quick alert if disturbed.  Remember, it seemed as if I was safe enough as long as I was awake, but it was also fairly obvious that whatever was watching was not human and could be a serious threat.  &#34;It&#34; had something in mind, obviously, and it planned to come closer at the first opportunity. I first entered that half awake state on about the sixth day and was in it perhaps only 30-40 seconds.  The thought that my privacy might already have ! been inv aded or I might be in danger came suddenly, and I abruptly opened my eyes.  Yes, the door was open a good 9-12 inches.  There were five creatures peeking in the opening.  They looked exactly like the classic Grey, except that I could only see their heads as they leaned over each other.  I thought they looked like little circus men, but had never heard of Greys or space aliens in 1959, and I was only 11. Now, after they&#39;d been caught in this way, the door was kept much tighter.  I thought perhaps they&#39;d been frightened completely away, but no, they came again each night, but the door never again opened more than an inch.  Their boldness had been diminished.  But I was still very curious myself, so I stayed.  In fact, I decided to stay longer than my two week plan.  I was not frightened too much, but quite frightened at the thought of going to sleep, because I didn&#39;t know what they might then do.  But staying awake all night every night for 20+ days can be difficult, so I ended up drifting off again.  Again, I abruptly opened my eyes.  This time the door remained nearly shut as usual, but something else was happening.  There was a column, or zone, of vibrating light, highly energetic, but without sound.  It appeared that the creatures were &#34;transporting&#34; into the room with some sort of energy field.  I&#39;ve heard of abductees reporting a bluish light.  I don&#39;t remember any actual color, but I do remember the strong, twitching movements and concentrated light about a foot wide and roughly four foot high. This is my big story.  It is quite true, not exaggerated one iota, and I am therefore fully convinced of the Greys&#39; reality.  I got very bored with the game after that, was a bit frightened, and so I went home.  I didn&#39;t tell the old folks about it because I did not expect to be believed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Although we believe that some interaction takes place between humans and otherworldly creatures, this may be the first time we have ever heard of twenty straight nights of visitation.  Moreover, it allegedly occurred in 1959, which raises the question of how the witness could remember the number of nights of visitation, and other details, so precisely.   PD))<n>

6/1/59 12:00|Nashville|TX|Unknown|15 Minutes|Object seen in sky as a star during daylight was photographed as a flying triangle|10/27/04|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/039/S39860.html|17|ndxe195906| Object seen in sky as a star during daylight was photographed as a flying triangle<n> <n><n> <n><n> This event ocurred, as best I can remember, between 1958 - 1961. This event was reported in, and included a photograph on the front page of, either The Tennessean or the now defunct Banner newspapers in Nashville, Tennessee. The Tennessean bought out the Banner, existing archives could be researched through The Tennessean. My Mother and I were riding in her car. The day was bright and cloudless. As we were driving along, we saw an object appearing motionless very high up in the noon sky. It simply looked like a star that had come out during daylight - just a pin point of silver in the blue sky. We watched it for about 15 minutes. We were not alarmed, only curious. The following day, my Mother showed me the newspaper. We were not the only people who saw it. The paper reported a &#34;flying triangle&#34; and a photo of a arrowhead-shaped object against the black of space was pictured on the front page. I&#39;ve put it out of my mind for years. The more I read of triangle shaped UFOs, the more my memory was jogged about the &#34;flying triangle&#34; reported in the newspaper with that photo that my Mother and I saw when I was very young.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

6/1/59 08:00|Wabash River (on)|IN|Circle|15 minutes|Metallic object up close|2/14/08|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/060/S60487.html|19|ndxe195906| Metallic object up close<n> <n><n> <n><n> As a child of nine or ten my father ,myself, and a friend,exsperienced a UFO that still puzzles me today,I&#39;m 57 yrs old now and still this is vivid in my mind. We were running trot lines on the Wabash river, and noticed a object in the sky. This object came right over the top of us at tree top high maybe 30 ft. in the air with no sound was round in shape but had flats all over it approximatly 20ft. in dia. with four cylinder shaped bars coming out at the top and bottom eight in all. The craft was metallic looking as the color was the same as oxidized aluminum,it had what appeared to me to be a antena on top and bottom with a light on top and bottom, it followed the center of the river like a floating balloon staying the same hieght as the river changed course this object also changed course following the river until we lost sight of it.I have told very few people of this sighting because in 1959 or 1960 people would not have believed me ,and possible thought me to be unstable.I do not know what this craft was ,I do not know if it was something from earth ,or from some other planet, but I do know we seen it, it was real, and to this day have never seen anything like it since.I am a succesful business man ,that has been wondering what the heck it was for almost fifty years. I will most likely never know, other than it was a U.F.O.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.
