8/31/90 22:00|Sterling|MA|Unknown|3-4 hours|2 kids in a tent harassed all night by sounds, a bright light and something trying to enter our tent. 500 Lights On Object0: Yes|3/10/11|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/080/S80222.html|1|ndxe199008| I am a Technical Sergeant in the USAF.  My encounter was long before my AF career, but I feel it is time to share it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In the summer of 1990, a friend of mine and I camped out in my backyard.  I lived in Sterling, Massachusetts, on a five acre horse farm bordered by woods, a river and, behind a row of pine trees, the neighbor&#39;s yard.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We set up camp in a fenced-in enclosure where we had a tree, a swing set and a sand box.  Our tent was set up about 200 feet behind our house, under the tree.  It was a small, blue two-person tent the shape of a dome.  Behind our campsite was the horse paddock and to our west was a garden where we had grown vegetables throughout the warmer months.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We stayed up into the hours of darkness playing cards and telling stories.  Around 10pm we heard a loud bang in the woods.  It sounded as if someone hit a tree with a heavy wooden bat.  A few moments later, again. BAM.  And again...BAM.  It continued on banging for 10 minutes or so. Consistent and precise.  It was unnatural.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were fenced in, and gladly so.  We had no intention of venturing into the woods to find out the cause of this sound.  As my friend and I discussed it, we considered the horses in the barn, kicking the walls of their stalls... or perhaps a loose door, slamming shut in the wind.  None of these explanations fully answered the situation, but our agreement that it was nothing threatening was comforting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After the banging seemed to have ceased, my friend and I continued playing cards, talked and relaxed.  Suddenly, the side of the tent facing the west (and I&#39;m getting those familiar chills and hairs on end as I type this)... lit up as bright as day.  My friend and I were in awe. We both looked up... looked at one another and looked back.  We couldn&#39;t see through the tent material, but this light was imposing.  There was no sound.  It was if the light came from the sun itself.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was around 11 pm at night. There was no flicker to the light, there were no rings from a lamp or flashlight.  It was as if the hours had shifted and the brightness of the afternoon came half a day too soon.  It lasted a long time.  The light stayed, unmoving, never waning.  It was there for as long as twenty minutes.  Then it was gone.  No sound.  No wind or rush of air as if something large were moving nearby.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Almost immediately, from behind us, something pushed against the tent.  It was low to the ground... and it was slow, but steadfast.  We both saw it simultaneously.  My friend turned white and looked sick.  My only instinct was to protect my friend.  When he turned the color he did, I couldn&#39;t see any other answer...  I attacked whatever it was that was coming for us.  I grabbed my step-father&#39;s heavy duty flash light (the kind with four D batteries and a metal frame) and I wailed on whatever it was that was there.  It was a sickening sound of metal against bone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I expected a shriek... a growl... anything.  There was no reply.  Nothing.  After I hit it, we froze.  We waited, holding our breath.  I don&#39;t know what he was thinking, but after hitting something as hard as I did, I half-expected something to rip our tent apart and tear into us.  Or scream and run away in pain.  Nothing happened.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A minute passed.  For the first time on that night, I opened up the zippered door to the tent and I looked outside.  I looked around the side of the tent where the thing I had hit approached us from.  Nothing.  Nothing within or outside of the fence that surrounded us.  No dead squirrel.  No midnight rapist with a broken hand.   And then I zipped up the tent.  We waited.  I fell asleep.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The next morning my friend had wide eyes.  He was sitting up looking down at me.  He said, &#34;It came back.  While you were sleeping, the light came back.&#34;  It&#39;s hard to explain, but even I had a hard time believing him.  Just mere hours after sharing this experience with him, and for some reason I just didn&#39;t want to believe it was true.  The thought of the light on me while laying there asleep and helpless shook me more than seeing it did.<n> <n><n> <n><n> And that&#39;s what happened to me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The other night, I had an epiphany.  If these 3 events are related... the banging, the light and the &#34;hand&#34; reaching through the tent, why?  My conclusion is this: First, the sound was meant to draw us out with curiosity.  Second, the light was to get us to scatter like cockroaches under a kitchen light.  Finally, the most brazen was the physical contact... touch.  They were using techniques that focused on fear and curiosity to lure or scare us out of the tent.  And they were using each of our most accessible senses.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My friend&#39;s father was in the Navy and moved to Naples, Italy later that year.  I have contacted him once on Facebook and asked if he remembered the incident.  Unfortunately for me, he didn&#39;t remember the incident.  There is a small sliver of hope... he did say he doesn&#39;t remember this experience but that he has a fascination with the paranormal... perhaps a lingering notion of some past experience guides him.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

It was pretty late at night, around 11 or 12:00. I don&#39;t exactly remember what we were doing, but we looked up into the sky and there was this big round thing floating in the air. As I remember, it had red lights lined all around it. It probably had 7 or 8 lines of them... sort of like xmas lights on a tree, but the lights were different sizes. I think I remember seeing some of the lights blink, but I could be mistaken. I couldn&#39;t say how big it was exactly, but it seemed to me to be pretty big. It was kind of spooky to see at first, but then we went back to playing tag for a while and I remember looking back up at the sky and it had gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I was lying in bed looking out the window towards the sky.   Suddenly I noticed a very bright light coming from the south,  moving slowly over the trees in front of the house.  By the time I put my glasses on the UFO was directly over the house at 2-3000 ft.  It was moving very slowly in a steep upward direction. There was no sound whatsoever.  It was rectangular in shape, and had two rows of three bright lights.   Very high intensity.   I got up and ran outside, which could have only take a minute, but by that time it was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I noticed it was extremely dark out and extremely clear sky.  something made me look up when i did i noticed 4 lights moving on an object directly above my home.  It was absolutley silent the 4 lights were under the object which appeared to be in somewhat of a square in shape the lights were not bright they were dim and had an orange tint. it was moving from the south (away from the ocean) to the north, it seemed to be flying just above the treeline (redwood tree) of the tree next door it moved at a slow steady speed as it passed over my house i yelled for my wife as I ran through the house to front door in hopes it would still be in view from the front yard.  it was gone.  It took me a few minutes to comprehend what I had just seen.  I phoned 911 to inquire whether anyone else had reported seeing any strange low flying objects, i was referred to the faa.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I could see the shape shitfting smoothly like the tail of a jellyfish or a flock of birds. But the distance between the dots never shifted or broke pattern. There was total silence and steady movement. I could see the spaces between the dots clearly and as it got further away the dots got smaller. But the whole time it was totally silent and it was dark out but I could see each of the dots clearly. What caught my attention was the amount of dots and the flowing movement the group of dots made. It was not sharp movements but smooth flowing, rotating movetments.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I looked all around in the sky to see if I could find it but It was no where to be found..I really started to think about what we had just seen.and to me it was not any type of plane or helicopter.I am pretty good at spotting man made aircraft at all times of the day and night. before living in Tn. I grew up near an International Airport. My friend also couldnt see it anywhere around his side of the car.The wierdest thing about this was that to me I got this funny feeling inside that it knew we were looking at it....!and thats why it disappeared.To make things more interesting that about 3,4 weeks later.There was a county police officer who came foward and claimed to have video taped the same object my friend and I had seen.He was on this show at the time called &#34;A current affair&#34; they showed the tape on the show and yes it did look exactly like the ball of light we seen! he also claimed after coming foward with his story. He was ridiculed by his coworkers and that when he was not at home one day. someone ransacked his house,like they were trying to find something.anyhow that is my story about what my friend and I had seen. I believe that it was not anything explainable maybe it was military but I doubt it! I believe that it was extraterrestial....<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.  PD))<n>
8/20/90 10:00|Winslow|AZ|Formation|seven mins.|Extremly unusal aircraft observed in highspeed flight and hover during day light hours.|11/26/03|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/033/S33168.html|10|ndxe199008| Extremly unusal aircraft observed in highspeed flight and hover during day light hours.<n> <n><n> <n><n> During the summer of 1990 while traveling East on I10 outside of Winslow, Az I sited to my left (9 o&#39;clock position) a formation flight of two aircraft with one aircraft trailing behind the left wing of the lead aircraft.  Their speed appeared to be that of  a jet military fighter aircraft, and on first observation thought - great- two F-14-s or what ever. The aircraft were headed South  and after crossing over the Interstate they abruptly went to a hover. I was closing quickly on the stationary aircraft and then observered a third aircraft to my left traveling South, by this time I was within less than two miles from the two hovering aircraft.  The third aircraft came into the formation with the other aircraft remaining stationary in a very abrupt manner, similer to what would be called hot rodding if a helicopter pilot did this. The aircraft remained in hover together for atleast a minute or two before rapidly accelerating and departing out of to the South in level flight.  Would judge their altitude to of been at about 500 to 700 feet.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The craft appeared to all be the same, however the aircraft who entered the formation is the one aircaft I focused my attention on.  In general shape it appeared to be simlar to the aircraft Dick Rutan is building to go into outer space, but that is where it ends.  The craft was a delta/flying winged aircraft with winglets or vertical stabilizers on the outside of the wings, the nasel (nose) of the craft was rounded and the empenage (tail section) appeared to have a slight down wash. Upto this point all seemed normal, but where a normal F117 or other aircraft would have a cockpit canopy  an oval shaped tower was located at 90 degrees to the rest of the plane - simlar to the command bridge on a submarine.  The surface of this tower was porouse, looking  like you skin does under a microscope.  It was curved over at the top as if the center might be open or accessible to enter or whatever.  This tower had three colours ringing it horizontally, they were flat gray, black, and a magenta (maroon), appeared to blend into each other with no clear division of the clours.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Everything seemed normal aerodynamicaly for a high performance plane except for this unusal tower sticking up (i.e. immense drag etc.). The rest of the aircraft appeared to be a light gray along the lines of  what some Air Force planes are painted.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Have not came forward with this at the time of siting because I thought just possibly the craft could be of this world and felt it not my place to disclose any advance craft of our nation.  However, it has now been about 13 years and I&#39;ve sure not heard of any such craft in our  military inventory as of late.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In closing, I am a retired soldier (22 yrs.) who worked in intelligence and hold a commercial aircraft license airplane single, multi-engine land with instrument and CFI. I seek no attention from this, but only wonder any other folks might have seen similar aircraft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

We were to meet in El Dorado Hills for some supplies. It was late, about 10:15pm when we met at his RV. We were all outside on a very clear warm evening, No moon that night you could see billions of stars and easily spot a satellite going by in space, and I did. Being an avid astronomer myself, I pointed almost directly up at the sky and said &#34;look at this satellite going by&#34; So by the time everyone looks up and sees it - out from the south came a fish-tailing light about the same brightness as the satellite. It was fish-tailing from left to right as it went forward in space. And guess what, it was on a collision course with that satellite! ((Uncle&#39;s name deleted)) uncles older niece  (sic--cousin to witness??) said &#34;what&#39;s that thing below it?&#34; My jaw dropped.. I replied, &#34;I don&#39;t know..&#34; We all watched as this weird object made its way with the satellite in it&#39;s path. When it got to almost where it looked like they were going to collide.. BOOM! This thing just went crazy, started doing these violent superfast zig zags around the satellite as if it were threatened!! It did that in an instant, and when it did we all screamed at the same time! Look at what we were witnessing way up in space! And I bet we were the only ones to see it. You had to be looking up at the right place at just the right time. Nothing we have will ever reproduce the swift movements of whatever that thing is/was nor does it make any sense to have such vehicles behave like that. After the zig zag attack on the satellite, the craft went back into it&#39;s fish-tailing left to right movement as it went forward, heading West, high above the earth. About a half a second-left and a half a second right is about the pulse it was moving at. It seemed like an inefficiant way of travel. Very alien. We watched it fishtail for about a minute until it was too far away to see anymore. You probably won&#39;t believe this, but I had a sighting 2 years prior to this in the same ar! ea! With this sighting I am now fully convinced we are NOT alone in the universe.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

Here&#39;s my description; I seen a totally green object 500 feet or so above the treeline. I was on the highway, it was coming right at me. As it came closer I noticed another light (soft yellow light) going from one side all the way around the front to the other side, repeatedly. As it came closer I noticed this light was all together seperate from the green one. As it approached the hi-way a bus in front of me hit its passenger lights to let kids off the bus. When it did that, the smaller light went under the green light and lit up, also the green light lit up. I realized then there were two craft, the yellow one was the size of a large truck and the green one was as big as a football field. Unknown if any of the kids seen it?<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We would welcome reports from any other witnesses, in order to corroborate what this student reports here.

I went outside to have a smoke, as my mother and father are not smokers. After a short while I saw a beam of light coming down from the sky. The beam was only about 75 to 100 yards from where I was smoking. It seemed as if the light was searching for something; moving here and there, up the hill and then down the hill. At first, I thought it might have been a helicopter searching for something, but I didn’t hear the sound of the blades cutting through the air. The sky was very dark blue and the stars were out, but when I tried to see where the light was coming from I couldn’t see a thing. I thought at least I would see a silhouette of the thing from where the light came. I called to my nephew, who was about 9 or 10 years old at the time, to come outside.  He yelled back that he was watching something on television. A few minutes later the light went out. This was the strangest experience I ever had and remember it forever. Every time I hear the word ‘UFO,’ or ‘alien,’ I always think of this strange moment in my life.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

The lights were red yellow and blue. I had the feeling that it was a party craft! It felt like whatever or whomever was in that craft was partying. I just sensed that strongly. There were other vehicles going the same direction as I, but none of them stopped or looked at it. It seemed that I was the only one seeing it! It was about 50 feet from me to the east. It was just over the trees. It was dark and I couldn&#39;t see the horizon as the sun set in the west. I was dumbfounded that no other vehicles seemed to notice it.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was a very clear, quiet night with no moon visible.  As I was looking southwest I noticed movement in my periferal vision from the west and glanced in that direction.  I was stunned by what I saw.  An object traveling from the west to the east was blocking out the stars in the sky as it flew past at an extremely high rate of speed directly over my head.  The object was triangular in shape with the widest part being wing tip to wing tip.  The shear size of the object took my breath away.  It flew low to the ground, less than 600 feet.  From wing tip to wing tip I would estimate it to be 300 yards across.  From nose to tail approximately 100 yards.  It appeared to be rather flat from top to bottom, no more than 20 yards thick.  All of the edges seemed rounded, not sharp or crisp.  This object had no external lights that could be seen from below.  It had a dark, dull metallic sheen similar to the dull side of aluminum foil which reflected city light from below.  It&#39;s stealth and speed was nerve shaking.  As it passed I looked for exhaust flames, ports or vapors and I was astonished that there were none.  I waited for the sonic booms to follow as I new that this aircraft was traveling in excess of Mach 1.  I have seen small Air Force jets at Mach 1 or greater and know the speed and sounds they create at those speeds.  This huge object flew faster than any aircraft I have ever seen and did not make a sound, not even a low rumble.  There was nothing but silence.  I was in awe and disbelief of what I had witnessed.  I stood there for 30 minutes or more hoping to see another flyby and still contemplating what I saw and if I really did see it.  The total length of time of this brief veiwing lasted no more than 5 seconds. I waited for days to read something in the newspapers to verify what I saw by others.  I lived very close to March A.F.! B. and t hought that surely they picked this craft up on radar and would leak something.  I have told only a select few friends of what I witnessed that night, not wanting to be labled as crazy.  They think I&#39;m crazy.  I just happened to be at the right place at the right time, looking up at the sky.  What prompted me to write my account at this late date was an account by someone else that was very similar to mine, who posted with your site.  The occurance date was 4/27/2001, location-Alpine, CA. and Triangle shaped.  My mm/dd/yy may be off slightly as I am not sure of the exact date but I can pinpoint very close due to certain events that took place during that time.  Haley&#39;s comet was to be visible by eye and a certain pilot of a famous politician or celebrity died in an experimental aircraft testing crash in the Nevada desert I believe.   I am an honorably discharged veteran of the Air Force and have seen many of our government aircraft including the stealth bomber and stealth fighter aircraft as well as the SR-71.  This craft is none of those or even close.  I only hope that it is one of ours, if it&#39;s not, we are seriously outmatched!<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

Speonk is a tiny little town in the south east part of Long Island, right next to West Hampton. I had been out visiting some friends and was on my way home. It was about 2 or 2:30 am, and I was driving down Old Country Road. Old Country road is well named - it&#39;s long and windy, with long stretches of nothing but trees or open fields, broken up by the occasional home.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was tired and taking Old Country faster then I should have (the friends I had been visiting lived about 45 minutes to an hour away, so I&#39;d been driving tired for a while), and so I was annoyed to discover very slow moving traffic ahead of me just as I was getting close to Speonk. I was forced to slow down to about 10 or 15 miles per hour, and follow grumpily along behind the 3 cars ahead of me. I was actually just about to stand on my horn when I discovered why they were all driving so slowly - outside my driver&#39;s side window, on the north side of Old Country road, we were passing an open fiend, and hovering stationary in the field there was an object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was dark, so I never saw its exact shape, but there were blue, red and white lights seemingly affixed to its exterior, and bright blue cone shaped lights would occasionally fire out from underneath it, to scan the field below. At first, I thought it was a helicopter, but I couldn&#39;t hear the propeller noise, or feel any wind even though if was relatively close to the road (maybe 200 feet away, and slightly lower then the nearest treetops). I rolled down the window to get a better view, and to better hear any propeller noise, and that&#39;s when I noticed that it was rotating end over end (it HAD ends - even though I couldn&#39;t see it well, I had the impression it was spherical), that it to say vertically, and slightly horizontally as well. This removed any question from my mind that it might be a helicopter - I&#39;d never seen or heard of a helicopter that while stationary, could slowly rotate upside down, while also turning horizontally and shining beams of light down at the ground below. Once my window was completely down, I also noticed that there was absolutely no sound whatsoever coming from the direction of the open field, and the UFO. Me and the rest of the strange 2:30 am traffic along Old Country crawled along, staring at the object in amazement until it was obscured by the reoccurrence of trees along the side of the road. We all just sped up and wend home, without ever saying a word to one another. The next day, I gathered some of my friends who lived in the Speonk/Hampton area, and told them what I&#39;d seen. They laughed at me, and one of them reminded me that Calverton military base is just a few towns over. Those of us who live in the area have always been sure that the military is doing some thing over there that they don&#39;t want the rest of us to know about. There are signs on the fence surrounding the military base that say things like &#34;Do not stop&#34; (you&#39;re car), and such. He suggested that maybe the military was testing some new secret military aircraft. Maybe so, but I&#39;ve never seen anything befo! re or si nce that day to suggest that the American military has aircraft that can do that.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In case you&#39;re interested, I&#39;m the Senior Systems Administrator for a Long Island Technology company.<n>

I was asleep in bedroom, home for summer vacation after my sophmore year in college. I could not sleep so like I used to do on some nights, I looked out my window. Across the street from where we lived was an open field maybe 50 yards wide and long. The sky was unusually bright to be 2:00 am in the morning. I saw a lot of fog and flying around the fog were different color lights that were red, blue, green and yellow. I ran and told my mother and father and they told me to look out the door. I opened the door and it was still there, probably about 60 feet in fron of my house. I was frozen and I thought about running out and running into the fog to see what would happen. I did not have the guts to do it and I watched for about 15 minutes. It still did not vanish! After a while a went back to the room and layed back down. When I looked out of the window about an hour later it was gone. I do not know if it was a UFO or a ghost or a portal to another dimension but I am glad that I had the experience.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

All I could do was watch in amazement at my very first UFO sighting, too bad I was alone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object(s) looked to be triangular in shape but in a connect-the-dots sort of way as if there was nothing in between these dots of light, there were just staying in silent formation very low over a group of houses next to mine, and seemed to look as if was being looked at while it was behind something hot.(like hot roads look like they have water on them on a hot day) Also (maybe just my imagination) I think I saw a vey faint yellowish whispy trail being left by this object as it went and dissapeared through some trees where I finally lost visual contact. The lights on this object all three of them seemed to be some sort of yellow-orange-reddish color.<n>

Myself my good friend ryan and my girlfriend were walking along the beach when we saw a light over the ocean in the distance At first we thought it was a very bright star, but then another smaller light emerged from underneath it and then a second. For about 30 seconds the two smaller lights seemed to be slowly moving in a figure eight pattern then proceeded to move down to what looked like the surface of the ocean. They moved back and forth across the water and the slowly made their way back up to the original ball of light moving in figure eight pattern the whole time then one by one they merged into the original light which then began to slowly rise for maybe 20 seconds and then seemed to shoot up silently into space in the blink of an eye.

But the heretofor incident was very real. On a clear bright star but moonless night, on Horeshoe Road which goes from Horeshoe (a fishing village) to Cross City, Fl. A country road through logging lands, just north of the bottom of the Suwannee River at the Gulf of Mexico. Children in the back seat of my car, noticed a &#34;shadow&#34; moving paralel to our vehicle on the left and just ahead. I looked out and up from driverside window and saw a triangular shaped (dark) image moving at approximately same speed as our vehicle. It didn&#39;t seem to be more that a couple hundred feet high. On this deserted road, I stopped the vehicle and turned off the lights to try to get a better look at what it was. The object stopped, pivoted, and began slowly coming in our direction. There was no sound that could be heard coming from it. The mother in the passenger front seat became very scared and demanded I get in and &#34;get us out of here&#34;. Somewhat unnerved myself, I complied. I continued to observe this object pace us all the way back to Cross City. The children were slightly scared, and being calmed by their mother. Once in Cross City, I chose not to go directly home not wanting &#34;it&#34; to see us pull into the driveway. I watched as the object slowly took a southerly route away from our location. All movement was very slow and some of it&#39;s turns where at almost a complete stop and in pivotal fashion. In the star lit country sky, we watched this triangular shaped object cover stars and then see the stars reappear behind it as it moved. It had no lights on, and didn&#39;t seem to have any paticular direction to go, sort of as though it were just moving about merely to observe....The next day, I reluctanly approached a freind with the expirience because I was concerned with being thought badly about, since at the time I was in law enforcement. As it turned out several other people had seen this UFO as well. I am divorced from the m! other me ntioned above now, the children were hers from a former marriage. At the time of this incident, they were ages 7,9 and 12.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

It is strange and hard to describe, but I will try.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have this overwhelming feeling of guilt or saddness, or some sort of PHYSICAL-emotion that is either overwhelming or bad.  Gravity feels stronger or muddy-like, and every thing I stare at grows, or my eyes had telescopic vision.  All I wanted was for this to go away as soon as possible.  I would therefore go to my mom&#39;s bed and lay with her, staring at everything growing with this terrible feeling inside and outside of me.  Words and crying didn&#39;t seem possible at these times, so the other witness, my mother, was unaware.  I think I  cried when I was younger.<n> <n><n> <n><n> All these events I thought were personal until one night a caller on Coast to Coast named Brian described almost the exact same events happening to him when he was younger.  I almost cried.  I say telescopic vision, he said things grew when he stared at them (he specified his mom growing, so he was probably feeling the same thing too and went to her).  He also said he saw those two white theater face masks, you know, I think the one is laughing and one was crying, up in the corner kinda just there, and I freaked out because I had one of those in my house, or so I thought. I swear I have a memory of having them but thinking on it for four years now, I am positive we have never owned that. That is weird.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I swear everything I wrote is the absolute TRUTH.  I even left out my speculations so you will not dismiss this odd one.

I apologize for the lack of info regarding the exact date, but I was 10 years of age at the time and not aware of your work or where (other than the local police), I could possibly report such an incident.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was about 10pm, and I was on the third floor of a two-family house, owned by my grandparents since the mid to late 1960&#39;s. The part of the house I was in was inhabited by my aunt L (my mother&#39;s sister) and her son, my cousin, F. He was three years of age, almost four, and I was babysitting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My mother lived directly below, which pertinent to this story, and I will relate to it later.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were both in the bedroom which has one window facing Northeast (in approximation to the way I was sitting). We were on the bed, watching television, and the window was open.<n> <n><n> <n><n> From the corner of my eye, I noticed a light that suddenly flashed on, or appeared out of nowhere and seemed to be moving. I turned toward the window and that is when I noticed an oval object sitting directly above the moon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The moon was full and exceptionally bright (perhaps the fact that the moon was full will make it easier to deduce what day it was..., and this object sat above it and did not move. It just sat there.However, everytime I looked away this object would move and go from one end of the window to the next and then stop once again, to rest above the moon. If I hold my hand out in front of me, at arms length, I can assess that the moon was the size of my fist and the object was the size of the pad of my thumb! It was HUGE and it was LUMINOUS.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I told my cousin to take a look, to confirm that I was indeed seeing this object and he reacted with genuine fear to which I too became increasingly frightened.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I grew up on sci-fi, was an outcast amongst my peers and was even nicknamed E.T., so I was fully aware of the UFO and EXTRATERRESTRIAL phenomena, seeing as at that time I believed I was an abductee, and I think this is the reason why I was so frightened.<n> <n><n> <n><n> THe object stayed there for over an hour to which I called my mother and told her. I was frightened and asked her to locate my aunt and to tell her to return home because I did not want to be there anymore.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Now, when I asked my mother to check for the object, she did originally deduce that I was just looking at a satellite, however she did agree that there was indeed something there and that it was far too big to be sitting above the moon that way.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When my Aunt did return, some two and a half hours after the object first appeared, I had already had the shades down so as not to agitate my young cousin any more. However, when I opened the shades to show her...it was gone! I have since seen satellites in the sky, and I am an amateur astronomer, and I can honestly deduce from my current knowledge of the night sky, that what I saw that day was intelligent, perhaps even mocking me, but it was not a satellite nor was it Venus...it was something else entirely.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thanks for listening!

This made it clear that it was in no way a normal object, as the 2 lights stayed precisely opposite to each other as they rotated around. The 2 lights performed what i could only describe as an infinity symbol like maneuver before merging again with the original and taking off at very high speed on a reciprocal course (to the south) The lights were all white with no indication of beacons etc as per an aircraft. I turned off my engine the whole time the three lights were seperated and could hear nothing ,much less a helicopter hovering none to far overhead! the lights all moved swiftly and smoothly There wasnt a cloud in the sky and i could plainly see the stars near to the horizon.<n>

At first, I thought this was a departing jet, (with landing lgts on, from Portland International airport (PDX). However, there was only one round light, and that light came to a stop directly over Mt. Hood. The object&#39;s light grew in intensity, then the light abruply zigzad north and south at about a 8 mile direction (each way)in a split second, coming to an abrupt halt each time. The light came back to it&#39;s original course and proceded to move slow at first, then speed off, and out of site, within a two second period.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Later, I asked the park ranger if they ever get UFO sightings, and he said, &#34;all the time!&#34; This is the first time I made any UFO report.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was kind of silverish like the color of an F-16 jet.  It had massive structures on the bottom of it but I don&#39;t know about the top.  It covered up almost half of the sky.  I only remeber saying one thing and running before I have a complete loss of memory from that point on to about a few weeks later.  I kind of resembled the craft from the movie Independence Day but not quite that big. I could not see any lights because it was day.  I don&#39;t know anyone else that witnessed it but I&#39;m sure other people did because there is a highway right next to the location.  I don&#39;t know if my friend remembers because I am no longer friends with him.<n>
8/1/90 21:00|Wright Patterson AFB|OH|Disk|3 Minutes|UFO at the Air Force Base. tDad Military denies it still, but mother admits to it.|11/28/07|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/060/S60012.html|34|ndxe199008| UFO at the Air Force Base. Dad Military denies it still, but mother admits to it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My family and I were staying at the TLQ&#39;s (Temporary Living Quarters) we were moving to Dayton, Ohio. My father has been in the Air Force for quite some time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My mother threw her back out, and she was in the bed one night.  My father and I always love looking at stars and stuff, and that night we were suppose to have a meteor shower.  My mom helps verify the story, so I know that it really did happen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was about 10 years old. My father and I went outside and walked over to a good place to see if we can see the meteor shower.  As soon as we walked over to the area immediately there was a saucer aircraft I would say about 85 yards from us hovering near the tree.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My hair raised up on my arms and I stood their in AWE. The craft was rotating it had numerous different color of lights.  It was saucer shaped and I want to lean that it looked like it had a double stack shape to it.  It was hard to see the craft because of these lights all over it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My dad just stood their. I was like oh my god there is a flying saucer.  I couldn&#39;t believe it because my whole life my father said that stuff was non sense, but my mother believed in them because her mother had witness a UFO herself.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Within about 3 minutes, the craft immeditaley took off.  It made a vertical direction, and I am not kidding you, diffentely left us with a speed amazingly fast.  After that happened I know it was not man made, or at least anything that could have been man made with our current technology.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I immediately ran inside to tell my mom about it. My mom to this day stands behind me that I came in and told her all aboutit.  My father who works for Air Force Intelligence orginazatin even currently, denies it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Well I recently got married and have 2 small children myself.  I was telling my wife about it, and how it really bugs me my dad denies that this happened.  Even though I saw it, and immediately told my mother about it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I confronted him about it with my wife and mother.  He told me it was a blimp! LOL  A blimp does not shoot vertical at mach 7! +.<n> <n><n> <n><n> One t ime at another Air Force base my father and I saw a Nighthawk, F 117.  This was before the public new about stealth aircraft.  My father said that is a Military Experimental Air Craft.  So why didn&#39;t he dub what we saw a military expermental Aircraft like the craft that we did see.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

But I wanted to report it now, because I&#39;m compelled to.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I spotted a disk looking shape craft flying high and fast. I even saw windows. Jets fly at an angle so as to approach the runway. This object was moving straight up until gone. The way I figure it. Aliens were visiting, Hill Airforce base, for some reason or another that day, I tried hard to forget, because I don&#39;t want to dream about it any more.  I lived in Utah at the time.<n>
8/1/90 00:00|Neenah|WI|Light|10 min|Bright light hovering toward us suddenly took off fast changing shape and color|1/17/04|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/033/S33976.html|36|ndxe199008| Bright light hovering toward us suddenly took off fast changing shape and color<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object appeared to be a very large star towards the east above the horizon. As it approached it looked as though it the object was growing in size or its light was getting brighter. It did not sway from left to right for it was approaching toward our party. The object had a steady slow pace and did not appear to have shape. The light was far to bright to see the background of the object. It stopped and hovered in position for about 2 to 3 minutes and suddenly began to move left and to the north. The object gained speed (far much more then any commercial craft I and my party have ever seen). As it moved its shape appeard to change into a cigar shaped light. It passed behind the horizon. As it was approaching the horizon we could still see it and its color changed from a white/yellow to a red. It kept moving north until it could not be seen over the horizon. We all ran to our houses scared.  still to this day we have never seen anything like it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  Witness elects to remain semi-anonymous.  PD))<n>
