I know it wasn&#39;t my mother or father they were at the door as I could hear them, I became afraid because the only people lived in that apt were me,mom and dad.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Anyway I felt the skin on my thighs and arms( being a child I slept in underwear and tee-shirt), the skin was like a slim jim(beef stick) years later this is the only thing I could associate with the texture of the skin and dark brown, it was not male or female, skinny, small oval shaped head, large black eyes in over sized sockets, I didn&#39;t see a mouth, now my eyes were opened, but I was calm, no fear.  I woke up that mor! ning sun shining, I never spoke of it until I was 38 yrs old.  However I do have the ability to see things and places that I have never been before but can describe them.  Once when I worked at a plasma center a client had lost his ring, I told him to go home and look on the floor behind a nightstand in his bedroom, I just said it, he came back and asked me how I knew.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am 58 years old now, family and friends say that I don&#39;t age.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is a true story.<n>
