The stream is called Winters Run.  It is located between Route 7, and Route 1,and about a mile north of Mountain road.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We had parked about an hour before sunset, and near as I can remember we had a clear view of the stream in front of us and the bank on the other side.  After some time of smoking, listing to music, and just passing time.  I noticed a fireball off to the right.  It was in no hurry, and not high in the sky.  I told my date to look.  It was traveling the same route as the stream east to west.  It was throwing out what looked to be sparkles like the kids play with on the 4th of July.  I would say it took more than a minute and a half to pass from my right to left.  It did not lose any altitude, and just kept traveling towards WVa.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I then left the woods, and stream, and went to a fire station on Mountain Rd., and Route 7, where I reported this as a plane in trouble.  They said it was a meteor, and I left it at that.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In the years after, I thought if it had been a meteor the speed would have been greater, and it would be descending.  This thing maintained hight and speed over what must have been 40 to 80 miles.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This to me classifies as a U.F.O. Until someone gives me an explanation I can live with.  I am not saying it was being piloted by little green men, but it defies the senses.  I would like to unravel this if possible, I thought it might be the Kicks burg thing but the path is wrong.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Source indicates that date of sighting is approximate.  Report may address the incident that occurred in Kecksburg, PA, on December 09, 1965, given that the object that landed in Pennsylvania may have traveled a circuitous path, before it landed.  PD))<n>

They were definitely not birds or balloons, nor airplanes, nor temperature inversions, nor light beams from advertising searchlights. They were real and we both had them in sight for about 4 seconds.

They were flying fast in a diagonal  formation, were definitely piloted, each gently and separately undulating up and down as though slightly buffeted by the wind.  They emitted no lights and made not a single perceptible sound. We had been easily hearing birds chirping in the distance, but no engine sound or even a sound of airflow was perceptible, and the day was bright and clear and otherwise quiet. We were just out of earshot of the sound of waves hitting the beach.  These vehicles were not birds, not balloons, airplanes, not swamp gas, not temperature inversions, not kites, not anything but saucer-shaped vehicles. There could be no way we could be mistaken as everything was mid-day clear close view. My eyes happened to concentrate on the under rim of the saucers I saw a dark brown colored rim on the underside of the saucers of perhaps 2 feet in width. The vehicles otherwise were approximately the color of aluminum, I saw 3 hemispheric undercarriages spaced circularly at 120 degrees apart. I saw portholes. My girl friend&#39;s vision happened to concentrate on the top most portion and she saw yellow light in the port holes. They flew past us at perhaps 350 miles per hour and we had them in view maybe 6 seconds in all. They were less than 1/4 mile from us at the closest point. Based on the angle subtended by the vehicles and my estimate of the distance to them, I would make an educated guess that their sizes were about 150 feet in diameter each and perhaps 20 feet in height not counting the height of their undercarriages. They flew in the direction of the San Diego Airport and seemed to be totally unconcerned at being seen or if it was a danger to them. They appeared to be their own masters. I phoned the San Diego Airport, the! Miramar Naval Station and informed them as well as the local police. The police told me they had not received any calls thus far. Miramar Naval Station recorded my phone conversation but would not answer as to whether there were any other witnesses. After this encounter, my friend and I found a book in the library called &#34;Flying Saucers and Outer Space&#34;, written maybe in 1955, On one page there was a drawing of a flying saucer   As soon as we saw it, we both said to each other &#34;that is just what we saw&#34;. Mind you, prior to this, I and my friend had thought that those who said they saw flying saucers were seeing things by mass hallucinations, and gave these reports no credence at all. And neither of us had read a book at all on this subject. My girl friend became very frightened at this incident, and I, foolishly wished they would have just stopped and taken me aboard for a ride. But, having worked as a Mechanical Engineer in the Space industry for 20 years, and being well up on every flying vehicle known to man, for one thing I know of no vehicle now or even contemplated, that can fly without a very noisy engine to power it. If there was a noiseless engine it would have been put to very good use a long time ago, for example on the very expensive Concord Aircraft, which was only allowed to fly over uninhabited areas because of the incredibly loud noise it made. From this fact and my general feelings about this I must conclude (the U.S. government and any nay-sayers not withstanding) that these vehicles are of a very very advanced stage of technology and that they are not of this earth.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((name deleted))<n>

They moved completely silent and without seeming effort. We were on the beach watching as they moved southbound about 1/2 mile inland from the ocean. They were less than 1/2 mile high<n> <n><n> and it was in broad daylight.  They were darkish brown in color, disk shaped with a dome on top and 3 small domes on the bottomand lighted portholes.They were definitely directed, piloted, made no sound whatever, omitted no lights whatever, just flew silently with very fast velocity, perhaps 400 mph, or perhaps slower. They flew towards San Diego Airport.  I called the Airport and Mirimar Naval Station, and informed them both, also the police as well.  They were definitely not birds, nor balloons, nor airplanes  nor temperature inversions, nor light beams. They were real and we had them in sight<n> <n><n> for about 6 seconds. After this incident my wife and I found a book in the library called &#34;Flying Saucers and Outer Space&#34; written in 1955. On one page was a drawing of a Flying saucer.  As soon as my wife and I saw the drawing we said immediately to one another &#34;that is just what we saw&#34;.  The sightings were made near my residence at  ((address deleted)), La Jolla. Based on approximate subtended angle and my guess of distance ( I am an engineer as well as a math Professor), the objects were about 150 feet in diameter, perhaps 15 feet in height.<n>

One day at school all the kids were talking about seeing a UFO that hovered over the gymnasium as the crowd came out from a game.  The same UFO later followed the away teams school bus and the bright light that shown on the bus forced it to pull over. Behind the bus were many parents cars and the chief of police of the away teams town. They were all witnesses.<n> <n><n> <n><n> That same night, one of the cheerleaders and her boyfriend were chased by this low flying noiseless craft shining a bright light on them. On arriving at the girl&#39;s house, the girls family came out into the yard to see what the light was,, all of these people were witnesses.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My friend and I were both teaching at this school, and decided to go out the following night and take our cameras and tripods and see if we could witness what everyone was talkin about. He and I were both very level headed people who did not drink and were born skeptics.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We drove along a &#34;river road&#34; that was west of Tabor, Iowa, next to the Missouri River. This placed us only a few miles from Offutt Air Force Base (headquarters of the Strategic Air Command) on the other side of the river. As we drove north on the River Road, my friend and I saw what we thought was a greenish yard light at a farm, but then noticed it was moving toward us at a rapid speed. we stopped and got out of the car and began to place our tripods, to take pics.  As we prepared to shoot the pics the UFO which had been traveling south approx. 100 feet off the ground shining a bright blueish green light over the ground, abruptly shot up at a 45 degree angle and behind the river bluffs. When it did this there was no sound except the rush of air around the object.  We got in our car and drove up a bluff road to see if we could  find it at a higher vantage point.  We didnt see anything of it and drove back down to the river road, talking about what it could be. We were out of the car, talking by the  road side, when i noticed to the south, a light moving slowly from east to west in the sky at about  1030 high in the view. It was moving slow then it fell almost at the speed of a falling star,, leveled out and began to move slowly north up along the river banks of the Missouri River. My friend and i immediately set up our cameras, and it continued moving North and just slighly (less than 1/8th mile) to the west of us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> it passed us and continued north and during that time my friend and I both took 5 or 6 photos.  then it once again changed directions moving East, for a bit then shoot up almost instantaneously at a 45 degree angle and behind the bluffs again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My friend and I went home to his darkroom and developed the photos. We both had images of the UFO showing arrangements of lights and a vague shape of the UFO.  The next day, I took one of the photos to school. When i had the students in class who had seen the UFO on the nights before, i asked one student who had seen it close to go to the board and draw what he saw on the board. He did,, and then i showed him the photo I took. I asked him if that was what he saw. He enthusiastically said yes it was. All the students who saw the photo that day said that it was what they saw. And his picture looked like my photo.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A day or so later, my friend called me and said that his home had been broken into and that the negatives and photos had been taken from his darkroom. Also, his camera had been opened and a roll of film taken from it. (that film was unexposed, but was taken also and the camera left laying open on his workbench) A short time later, the one photo I had disapearred, and my friend and I were kind of in a state of shock. We never talked about it again.  I thought many times to tell the story to someone, but, i honestly had a fear to tell it until this time. Its like something told me not to talk about it, you know? I think that there is something very odd about the fact that out of hundreds of witnesses and very reliable ones at that,, the school bus driver, the crowd coming from the gym, the chief of police of Sidney Iowa that followed the bus  home, teachers etc, it is very odd that this story did not ever get out because i have looked for it in various ways, wanting to know more but being afraid to talk too much. Now Im retired and wish to tell the story, i have a lot more detail, for instance, at the time the school bus stopped, one set of observers said the UFO hovered over the bus and the bus stopped on its own, but others said that the light was so bright the driver had to pull over and the cars behind all took to the shoulder to see what was happening.  My feeling and my friends feelings at the time was that it was something secret that was being tested by the STrategic Air Command. But all these years have gone by, and theres never been any aircraft developed that could do what this aircraft did. The rapid descent and ascent, passing so very close to us, with the river bluffs at our backs, with no echo, no buffetting of prop like a helicopter would have, only the whoosh of air sound,, as it passed, not loud at all almost a whisper. Its been a mystery to me all these years, but I definitely know that there are at least a hundred other people who saw the same craft over a 3- 4 day period. I wish that I had the date exactly, I dropped this from my active conscious thought, as soon as it got too creepy with the film and photos being taken. I can send you a drawing of exactly what it looked like, if you are interested. I would like to know if any of the other people who witnessed this have reported it also. Im not using my friends name, because I know that he,, like me, was not anxious to talk about it.  But now I want to. I dont know how to answer about having an investigator contact me, it asks if  I want that, I dont  object to that, lets put it that way.   thanks.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We express our gratitude to the witness for his sharing this report.

10/12/65 13:00|Pittsburgh|PA|Disk|1 minute|Low UFO sliding out of a cloud into clear blue sky.|2/14/08|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/061/S61127.html|10|ndxe196510| Low UFO sliding out of a cloud into clear blue sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Early morning drizzle stopped around noon, sky was clear blue with low white cloud rolls which were approximately 300 feet above the small hills of about the same height.  While driving south on PA State Route 51 a few miles south of downtown Pittsburgh just after noon a darker spot appeared in the end of one of these clouds seen at the top right of the windshield.  A quick look determined it was probably a puff of black smoke but another look was surprising to see a round saucer shapped craft slide out of the cloud into clear blue sky.  It was moving slowly from right to left bringing it closer but was tipped at about a 45 degree away.  Shortly after appearing in clear sky the craft went to a higher level about twice the height it had been at.  When it reached the higher level it still had the slow sideward motion and same degree of tip.  The motion to the higher lever was faster than the slow sideward movement but did not start out slow then get faster and slow down before stopping.  It was one smooth move and being tipped at that degree it carried the craft farther away and easily seen from the top of the windshield as it slowly crossed over the highway.  When it reached a point where it could be seen out of the driver&#39;s side window it suddenly came back down to about the same level it was when first seen.  The smooth fast motion back down was the same as when it went up and the tip never changed so it came closer.  When it stopped it still had the same slow sideward motion and it was observed sliding into the end of another cloud roll.  This craft never wavered and moved as if it was following a beam, when it went higher the craft maintained the same slant.  Assuming the visible part was the bottom of the craft no features,lights or sound was noted.  Judging by the height of the hills and clouds the size of this disc would be about the same as a small plane&#39;s wingspan.  Having recieved A&#39;s in Physics it was obvious this craft was moving with no propulsion system anyone had in 1965 an! d in fac t still do not today.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
10/12/65 12:00|Pittsburgh|PA|Circle|2 minutes|Saucer observed about 500 feet up moving into clear blue sky and flying square corners.|8/7/07|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/057/S57681.html|11|ndxe196510| Saucer observed about 500 feet up moving into clear blue sky and flying square corners.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After 2 morning job interviews in Pittsburgh a light rain had stopped with only clear blue sky and some low white cloud rolls were left not very high over the small hills beside the highway.  While driving south on PA Route 51 just a few miles from downtown Pittsburgh a movement toward the end of one cloud caught my eye.  When I looked up and saw it I figured it was a puff of black smoke and looked back at the road.  Then the movement which I could see out the top of the windshield on the passenger side caught my eye again and when I looked up I witnessed a round disc shaped object slip slowly from the cloud  into clear blue sky.  It was so obvious what it was I laughed and said aloud, &#34;Hey, you lost your cloud cover.&#34;  Judging by the size of a small plane&#39;s wing span of about 30 feet I&#39;d guess that to be the same distance across this craft.  The craft was moving as if following a beam and was moving very slowly  sideways tilted away from me so I was viewing the bottom I&#39;d think.  Shortly after losing the cloud cover and being only around 500 feet up it suddenly went to a higher altitude which would be about twice the height it was at or approximately 1,000 feet. There was no wavering or turning when it went higher, it went up at the same angel it was slanted at and moved in one motion, it did not start out slower, get faster then slow down to a stop.  The speed up to the higher level was at the same more accelerated rate, this movement took the craft away from where I was on the highway. I was now looking at it in the top middle of my windshield and where it stopped at it still had the same slow sideward movement.  It proceeded to go across the highway where I was watching it out of the top left of the windshield.  Then as suddenly as it went to a higher altitude it came back down to about the same level it was at when I first saw it but still had the same slant.  I watched out the driver&#39;s side window and observed it slide right into the end of another cloud.  This craft looked gray wi! th no li ghts or other distinguishing features and never changed its tip or slant and did not turn to go to a higher level or back down.  I think the most obvious thing about this sighting was the perfect lines or beams it was following with no wavering at all.  I received very good grades in Physics and I know even to this day that we do not have any type of propulsion system to make a craft fly like what I observed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date may be approximate, although the witness does not indicate that fact.

Being a politician, he frequently hosted political functions at our home on the weekends. This particular night, I had fallen asleep on the backyard patio during the party my parents were hosting. After the party attendants had left (approx. 23:30 hrs.), my father had awakened me and was bringing me into the house when we both heard a very loud explosion or bang. Both myself and my father were standing in the front door of our home looking straight down our street at the power transmission lines that were in the woods at the end of the street. We stood there watching the disk shaped object hovering for approx. 20 minutes over the power transmission lines before the object suddenly took off at an extremely high rate of speed. Due to my father&#39;s position, nothing was ever said of the incident, and this is the very first time I have ever reported anything about it, even though I have very vivid recollections of the event.<n>

10/2/65 22:00|Pittsburgh|PA|Disk|5 MINUTES|Like something I had never seen at the time or have ever seen again!|10/20/05|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/047/S47088.html|17|ndxe196510| Like something I had never seen at the time or have ever seen again!<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am nor sure of the exact date as it was a long time ago but I can tell you this.  In 1965 my Dad bought a 1965 VW Bus.  Once a week we used to drive in to Pittsburgh so that my Dad could drop off his Football Contest at the Pittsburgh Press.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On the night in question we were heading towards down and I remember my Parents kept commenting on a strange light in the distance.  After we had dropped them off and we were on our way home, we were heading up Bower Hill Road and I remember my Day saying Holy Sh*t look at that.<n> <n><n> <n><n> He then pulled off of the road to look at what he had seen.  I vividly remember looking up out of the window and seeing a large Round Saucer hovering several hundred feet above the Houses and Trees.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The Craft was slowly rotating and had windows all around.  There were also lights on the bottom.  It reminded me of a ring with Diamonds all around it with the Diamonds being Windows.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Me and my Brother and Sisters were very scared and were crying.  My Parents watched it for several Minutes before my day reached for his Camera.  As he was preparing to try and take a Picture it tilted slightly and took off at a high rate of speed.  It was gone within Seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When my Dad mentioned it at work several co-workers also reported seeing it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It is something that I will never forget and would love to see again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

10/1/65 21:00|Dushore|PA|Disk|5 minutes|It could move very slowly or very quickly but either way it moved without making any noise.|4/16/05|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/042/S42743.html|18|ndxe196510| It could move very slowly or very quickly but either way it moved without making any noise.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In 1965 I was 21 years old and worked for GE in Utica N.Y. in the radio receiver department.  I earned a two year degree in Electronic Technology after I graduated from high school in 1962 and went to work for GE.  Later I worked for AT&amp;T at a Microwave Relay Station.  AT&amp;T transfered me to a Satellite Earth Station where I worked for 17 more years.  I retired from AT&amp;T after 32 years service.  I have never smoked a cigarette, never did drugs, and I have never a had a beer in my life.  I have two daughters, one is an OBGYN doctor and the other is a speech pathologist.  They have had to listen to this account since they were old enough to understand it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is what happened, nothing has been added to make a better &#34;story&#34;!  What follows is the truth as I lived it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was Sunday night and I am not sure of the exact date.  I was returning to Utica, N.Y., where I lived, after a weekend home with my parents in the Loyalsock Creek area of Pennsylvania.  I had just purchased my new TR-4 car and was going north on Route 87 about 21:00 at night.  About an hour into the trip, I noticed some lights off to the right of the road.  I traveled this route many times and knew that the only thing in that direction was an empty field and what we call a mountain here in Pennsylvania.  The lights made me curious because they were red and green and flashing like the old railroad crossing once did.  The only difference was one side was green and the other was red.  If I had to describe the colors for someone, I would say they were &#34;Christmas Red and Green&#34;.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I slowed down and looked right and decided I had plenty of time so I would stop and satisfy my curiosity.  My first thought was that I was looking at someone working on the mountain side, maybe cutting lumber, but that didn&#39;t fit.  Next I thought it could be a helicoptor, but this was 1965 and we just didn&#39;t see that many of them.  I stopped my TR-4 in my lane of a two lane highway.  This was a very remote area at that time and I wasn&#39;t worried about traffic.  I looked at the lights and wondered just what this could be?<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was about 200 yards away from me and looked to be about 100 feet up the hill.  I shut off my car and let the headlights on so if that rare bit traffic would approach, they would be able to see me.  A Triumph is very small so I was able to reach over and roll down the window without getting out of the drivers seat.  I leaned over and put my arms on the open window and turned my head to hear what sound was coming from the lights.  No noise at all, except for the sounds of the October night.  I looked at the red and green flashing light and wondered just what was going on over on the hill.  I can&#39;t remember which side was green and which side was red.  As I sat in my car trying to figure out just what it was, that I was looking at, I became aware that it wasn&#39;t on the mountain side, like I first thought, but in front of the hill and above the field.  This soon became very clear to me because what I was looking at had started to move.  One thing people have the ability to do is determine if someing coming towards them is going to go left or right or directly at them.  The lights were coming directly at me at about 50 feet above the field.  I remember thinking &#34;Wow what is that&#34;, when I became aware of two very obvious conditions.<n> <n><n> <n><n> First, this thing was 50 feet up in the air and was moving very slowly directly towards me!  Second, it was completely silent!  No noise at all!  I remember thinking that nothing that size could be in the air and moving towards me without making any noise, it just isn&#39;t possible.  It was about 50 feet wide and 10 feet high, I would guess.  And I hate to say it because this is the point when people start walking away, but it was saucer shaped.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I watched it approach me until I realized that it was coming very slowly directly at me and it wasn&#39;t a blimp or helicoptor or plane or anything else that I have ever seen.  At that age we tend not to be afraid of anything and think that we are 10 feet tall and bullet proof.  It took a lot to get me afraid in those days.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At that point I started to think that I wasn&#39;t in a good spot since this thing was very slowly going to be right on top of me in a very short time.  Whatever I was watching was also watching me!  I decided to get out of there fast!  I rolled up the window and started up my TR-4 and put it in first gear and stepped on it!  I just had time to put it in second gear when I realized that there was, what I thought at the time, another one directly in front of me.  It was just off to the side of the road above the guard rail and about the height of a telephone pole.  I thought, there are two of them!  I quickly looked back to the center of the field to find the other one and it wasn&#39;t there.  I realized that the one I had been watching move so very slowly towards me had moved about 150 yards and came to a complete stop in about 3 seconds.  There it was with those red and green lights flashing and it was only about 50 feet above the road.  I looked back and forth again, yes it was the only one.  It couldn&#39;t have moved that far and that fast and been able to stop in 3 seconds.  It did all of that and never made a noise, complete silence!  All except one noise, my heart was beating so fast and hard that I could feel it in my throat.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have never been that frightened in my life before or after that night.  My first thought was to hit the brakes and not drive under it.  It didn&#39;t take me long to figure out that if I hit the brakes and stopped I would end up parked directly under it.  I made a quick decision to shift to the next gear and drive under it.  I remember looking out my windshield at this metal object with the green and red flashing lights as I drove under it!  I drove the next few hours to Utica without looking into my rear view mirror!  I don&#39;t know if I was so frightened that it would be following me or if I had just been that shook up.  One thing was clear, for some reason I wasn&#39;t going to look into my rear view mirror for any reason and I didn&#39;t.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have a few regrets in my life, like most people, but the one that is at the top of my list is that I drove away.  I wish today that I would have gotten out of the car and waited for whatever it was to get to me, at least I would have known exactly what it was.  Very few months of my life have gone by that I didn&#39;t think about what it was and what happened that night.  I was within 50 feet of this object.  I had a really good look at it.  It wasn&#39;t a reflection from an airport 500 miles away.  It wasn&#39;t swamp gas!  It wasn&#39;t a star or the moon!  It was real and fast and silent and close.  And yes the one that makes me feel the worst is when someone looks at me and claims that I made it all up or that it was a dream that I remember or some other total nonsense.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Very strange isn&#39;t it, we both think that the other is talking total nonsence!  One thing is certain, nothing back then could do what that object did and nothing today can do it either.  And unless some government has had some really great technology that they have kept secret, it didn&#39;t come from earth.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Many years back I was having my yearly physical and at the end of it my doctor asked me if anything was bothering me or if I had any problems.  I looked at him and said yes I do have something that has bothered me all my life.  Out came the whole account of the events just as I have written here.  I asked the doctor if he could use some method to take me back to that night to find out if anything more had happened?  He asked me if I had trouble sleeping or working and if I was happy?  I said no and everything was great.  He said that&#39;s the reason I won&#39;t do anything.  It could only harm you.  He said &#34;I believe every word that you have just told me and I wouldn&#39;t tell anybody what you have just told me&#34;.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I didn&#39;t speak about it for many years but I am 60 years old now and I just have this feeling that I would like someone else to know the secret that I am convinced of.  I hope I don&#39;t end up wishing I had followed the doctors advice.  A lot of people wonder if something very strange is going on, it is!  The problem is, there are so many nut cases out there that nobody believes it when they hear the real thing.  When I think about it, what a wonderful way to cover up what is going on, just keep putting out stupid accounts or faked pictures and movies and soon nobody will believe the truth when they hear it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> (NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date is approximate.

10/1/65 14:00|Colonial Heights|VA|Sphere|2 minutes|Saw sphere ping-ponging up and down and side to side in blue sky.|4/1/00|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/012/S12378.html|19|ndxe196510| Saw sphere ping-ponging up and down and side to side in blue sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was during late 1965 and I was home sick from school when I just happened to look out of the front door window when I noticed what looked like a metallic sphere reflecting in bright sun.  I remember how clear and blue the sky was and noticed this little ball about the size of the point of a Bic Pen slowly drifting westard.  I thought it must be a weather balloon because I could still see that it was rounded.  Of course I didn&#39;t think much of it until it suddenly stopped and simply hung in midair for a little too long. I thought that that was very odd - especially when it began to jiggle and ping-pong up and down and side to side with such speed, grace and agility that nothing earth-made could compare.  It then quickly dropped downward while increasing in size to about a pencil&#39;s eraser, still reflecting the sun and began jiggling and ping ponging some more.  It then drifted slowly eastward and rose and dropped again where it jiggled some more until it hung in midair again.  Then it finally shot eastward from a dead stop across the horizon and out of sight like a bullet. I all, I&#39;d say this took about two minutes.  This sighting was reported to local police and reported in the local paper.  About 18 months ago is when the Richmond Times Dispatch recreated the sighting and called it &#34;The Great Central Virginia Sighting&#34; and noted that more than 25,000+ reports of this are on file from the Cental Virginia area. I feel that I was very privileged in having seen what has to have been life from another world.<n>

It happened at a time when all of the school squadrons were in formation and marching to their classes.  A small cloud enity seperated itself from the clouded overcast ceiling and decended very slowly.  It made no noise. From within the cloud we could see a pulsating light the intensity of a flouresent light bulb.  It would pluse on then off approx at 2 sec intervals.  The clould then droped closer to the ground then stoped. Approx height (200 ft) then the cloud moved slowly in a level path to our left, at a right angle (NNW) then slowly returned to its original position.  It then rose approx halfway up to the cloud ceiling, then back down.  On its return up again if stoped at the halfway point for a minute, then suddenly disappeared.  All The Airmen saw it.  The Height finder from the Radar School appeared to be focused on it.  We were informed later that day, that what we saw was a weather rocket out of Alabama that had gone astray.  No more was said, not did I see any publication about this sighting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness corrected date after submitting report.
