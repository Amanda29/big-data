As we were setting and talking, we were talking about how it must be about over because the stars were starting to show in various openings in the clouds.  As I was looking North, at a small star at approximately two o&#39;clock, I noticed a very bright Orange/copper colored light just below it, which was just an odd color for any stars I ever watched.  I am a star gazer, and it was approximately 3 times the size and brightness as Jupiter is right now.  Short of the moon, on a non-cloudy night, it would have easily been the brightest object in the sky.   What made this very odd to me and made me really take notice was that it was brighter on the  outside edge.  It went from a darker, still bright, center to a very bright outer edge.  It seemed reversed from a typical light that would be brightest in the middle.  It stayed brilliant for about four seconds the began to shrink and fade away to noth! ing over a short few seconds.  It did not travel in any specific direction and appeared to be completely stationary. I observed, with my wife, for about twenty more minutes but saw nothing else.  Our view became obscured at times due to broken clouds rolling through.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was moving with a steady pace toward 4-5 o&#39;clock direction, then after a few seconds, it took a sharp turn into a 3 o&#39;clock direction, still maintaining this steady pace.  After the turn, the light slowly dimmed, then brightened up again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After about five seconds of steadily moving, the light dimmed out, then brightened up again.  After this, I&#39;ve stopped observing and moved on.<n>

He said it was about 100 yards out and huge round orange orb moving across horizon, low in the sky.  Then another, then another, five total.  The son said they seemed to be spinning and have an unclear whitish glow on the bottoms of orbs.  My friend didnt have his glasses on so could not see that clearly. TOTALLY silent. Their movement was towards Taylor,AR (looking north). The orbs lit up the sky around them.<n>
3/31/12 07:00|Miami|FL|Changing|30 minutes|Domed Orb Craft with 2 green lights and shooting white bursts changes to Plasma Cylinder|8/5/12|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/090/S90750.html|5|ndxe201203| Domed Orb Craft with 2 green lights and shooting white bursts changes to Plasma Cylinder<n> <n><n> <n><n> March 31, 2012:  ORB  AND  PLASMA  CYLINDER<n> <n><n> <n><n> On Saturday, March 31, 2012, my wife and I also saw two different objects in the corner of the first floor of our house.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At approximately 7 am that day, our dog barked and she went to bring him outside.  When she went downstairs, she saw a glowing ¾ orb with a dome top and flat bottom.  It was approximately 2 ft in width and 1.5 ft in height.  The object had two vertical lights inside which blinked green pulsating light.  Facing the object, on our left side, bottom part, the object emitted bursts of very bright white light, some long and some short.  The object was located near a corner wall and appeared to be floating about 5 feet off the ground.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My wife started to pray and started to telepathically talk with the object.  My wife thought it was some kind of heavenly angel.  The object seemed to respond by emitting the white bursts and more blinking of the green lights.  She was grabbing our dog at the time, and our dog had just had a stroke and was walking in a paralyzed fashion--  limping to one side real bad and falling down as she walked.  My wife asked if her dog can be cured.  The lights then began to blink a lot.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After 15 minutes of observing and communicating with this object, she started to yell for me to come downstairs.  I ignored her cause it was Saturday morning and I did not sleep well the night before and wanted to sleep.  After 5 minutes of her yelling she came up and finally told me what she had seen.  I first went to the bathroom and then downstairs.  I was very skeptical.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I got downstairs, we did not see the orb but a small cylinder shaped object which I am calling a Plasma Cylinder.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object did not appear to have edges but seemed like a fluid object with constant movement inside and on the edges of the object.  Inside were multi-colored lights similar to plasma.  Each color was not unique and separate like a rainbow but more meshed like colored water and the water colors are constantly mixing.  It seemed to be full of energy with colors floating stationary in the air.  The plasma object appeared to be about 1 ft in length and 6” in height.  It was about 5 feet off the ground near the same corner wall that the orb was previously seen.  The object then went directly through our wall to go outside.  I only saw the “Plasma Cylinder” object for about 2 minutes before it disappeared through our wall.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Attach is a picture of the ¾ domed orb and the Plasma Cylinder.  We are also attaching a picture of our corner wall.  Please note that the orb/plasma object appeared between the left wall and the flower picture.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Our corner wall is on the Western corner of our house.  At 7 am that corner is dark because light does not enter that corner.  We have also closed drapes on the Western window as well and that part was dark because the sun was just rising on the east side.  We know what we saw and it was not an illusion.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Also, note that we were going to put our dog to sleep in a few days before this incident--  she could barely move and was walking sideways and constantly falling down.  After the orb left, our dog did not appear to have any symptoms of the stroke--  she was walking perfectly fine.  She is still sick but she now walks fine.  We were freaked out by this.  Many of our friends saw the difference in her walk and we told them what had happened.<n>
3/31/12 02:00|Copperas Cove|TX|Unknown|Unknown|Visitation.|5/13/12|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/088/S88155.html|6|ndxe201203| Visitation<n> <n><n> <n><n> How do you know if you were dreaming or taken?   I&#39;m almost afraid to ask.... do I want to know?  I feel it in my body but my mind wont let me think it&#39;s true.  Here is what I felt.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Just before I fell asleep, I heard a ringing in my left ear, it startled me into full awareness. I totally woke up, I don&#39;t know why.  It took me a while to fall back to sleep.  I think this is because I read that this happens sometimes when people are taken.... so, could it of been a dream?  My mind thinking about it?   After falling asleep, I felt like I woke up but couldn&#39;t move..  I forced my eyes open and standing in my bathroom, in my line of vision was---- a grey I think.  short, thin, large head, black almond eyes, large eyes and I could see another in my peripheral vision.  The one in the door of my bathroom, it almost seemed like he was in charge... he was still and silent, very small movements... a light sway here and there.  He was intense, but I had the feeling he was friendly.  He didn&#39;t scare me, but I felt he was the one that was controlling my not being able to move.  I have the feeling he was the one that made me feel calm and after I panicked and became afr! aid, I think he is the one that gave me the feeling of euphoria.  He was in the shadows but I remember him clearly.  I was surprised that he was so short, maybe slightly taller than my door-nob I think. As I was laying down, I didn&#39;t have to look up to see him clearly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I quickly closed my eyes and told myself I was dreaming.  I don&#39;t know how long I stayed like that, it felt like only a minute.  It was like I could hear them thinking.  The second one, he moved quickly.  He is the one that frightened me, he is the one that has the sing-song voice. I thought he was singing in my mind,  I don&#39;t know what he was looking for but I do know he was going through my stuff... I only remember one thing of what he said, but I don&#39;t know what he ment by it, I remember hearing the words or impression of &#34;bad baby&#34;. and that disturbed me.  Last september, I went through a 4 or 5 day period of time... I knew I was pregnant.... I knew it.  When I was laying down and I rolled over, I felt the sharp painful pull of the muscle holding my uterus.... sounds funny, but I only had that when I was pregnant and the weight of the baby made the muscle pull, it started in my pregnancies at about the 5th or 6th week and always got worse the bigger the baby grew.  I al! so had a heaviness or a fullness in my uterus. I kept talking myself out of it, I finally got around to taking a test and it came up negative, but I could of sworn I was pregnant.  After talking with a friend and putting a few time lines together, I think they impregnated me. My friend said it usually only last 3 - 5 days.  I was happy I wasn&#39;t crazy and sad because I don&#39;t know if I will ever meet my child, is it my child?  I carried him, so I feel like it&#39;s my child, even if it was only for a couple of days.  Anyways back to last night. when he said &#34;bad baby&#34; it upset me because I thought that maybe something was wrong with my baby. At this point,  I still feel like I cant move.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I didn&#39;t want to see them so I closed my eyes.  That&#39;s when I got the weirdest sensation, I was floating, rotating around above my bed.  I was scared this whole time and yet not scared or maybe just this feeling of calm, this deep, deep sense of calm. As I was floating--- how do I explain this--- you know what the pressure you feel when your lying down, that softness of your bed when your really, really tired and it feels so soft and comforting and solid? That&#39;s how I felt all around my body.  This soft wonderful pressure surrounding me and it was nice.  I felt no breeze as I floated but I could feel the sensation of turning.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then I was back in my bed, I was more aware again and thinking of &#34;bad baby&#34; and then I heard a moan and thought it was one of my girls. I felt an intense protectiveness and became upset. I wanted to protect her but I couldn&#39;t move.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I felt an intense fear came over me.  I told them no--- or thought the words, it was like I could hear them with no noise.  I felt panicked, then suddenly I got this rush of euphoria.  I was covered in it. I could feel it everywhere in my body, I tingled with it, I could feel myself smiling, even laughing in my head.  It was wonderful. Then it was like the &#34;heaviness&#34; that surrounded me left, but I felt so good I didn&#39;t want to move or it would go away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My body felt heavy but my mind told me to move, so I started with my hands and as I wiggled my fingers I felt the euphoria leaving my body, going up towards my face, which still tingled.  When I stood up I felt unsteady and a heaviness in my limbs, but I still went to check the girls.  They were all sleeping.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I tried to go back to bed, but I felt surreal and when I just lay there I started to cry.  I don&#39;t know what to feel, I don&#39;t know what to think, I don&#39;t know if it was a dream or if it was real.  So I decided to write it all down on my computer, but when I turned on my computer, it made a series of low tone, loud buzzing noises, twice in a row.  I&#39;ve never heard it before.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;m really tired now so I think I&#39;m going to go back to bed. I don&#39;t know if I like this. I feel a little fear to go back to sleep and that&#39;s stupid, if it wasn&#39;t a dream... they wouldn&#39;t come back again... and yet at the same time I don&#39;t feel fear... I think because I believe that no matter what, I am God&#39;s child and He is watching over me and because He is God, they were created by Him too....  Weird.  I do know that I have that image etched into my mind...  of him standing in my bathroom doorway just looking at me... dream or real... I wont forget that.<n>
3/31/12 00:54|Bernardston|MA|Other|About 7 Seconds|Saw a green UFO really close to my car, lowered in valley; resulted in panicked coyote hit on I-91.|5/13/12|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/088/S88180.html|7|ndxe201203| Saw a green UFO really close to my car, lowered in valley; resulted in panicked coyote hit on I-91.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was driving on Interstate 91 in Massachusetts, just before the Vermont border.  I was in Bernardston. It was just before 1 am and I was driving in my car I had just gotten last month.  As I was driving, my light behind my radio display caught my eye because it went really dark and kept flickering between off and barely on.  The lights on my dash were acting funny too, as were my headlights. This snapped me out of my highway daze, as I had been driving for an hour and “in the zone.”  Mind you, this is a new car—this obviously isn’t normal behavior.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I began paying attention again from this I caught sight of a green light to my right in a sort of valley. I was in the traveling lane towards the guardrail, and the land appeared to dip there.  What I saw shocked me—it was what I can best describe as a floating piece of abstract art. Next to my car, it was massive, but in terms of Hollywood UFO sightings, it was very small. Nothing large to make those sorts of cropcircles you see in the news, either—very small next to those, but big next to my car. It was about five to ten feet higher in the air than my car’s roof was and was extremely close to me and low to the ground, again, in the valley.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was a guy driving in front of me and he was the only other driver around, and he braked and flashed his hazards so I know he saw it, too. Up close, it looked like it had a sea foam green sort of paint job on the belly, with precise lines and evenly marked. It was probably a three-foot-high green under border wrapping up the pieces jutting out from it. The rest was a dark chrome/silver. It had between four and six green lights that were darker on the outside of the circular shine, and a lighter shade in the middle. It had weird rectangles sort of prodding out, and odd tentacle shaped pieces. Think of the Grinch’s mountain, and flip it sideways curling up, and more of a gradual slimming of shape. This too had the border and there was a green light on top of it. this was the section I focused most on. The rest of the craft blurs in my mind; I focused on this and remember thinking it looked like a mish-mosh of shapes that somehow flowed smoothly together.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I stared at it in absolute shock for a few seconds—and then the lights pulsed. The lights were not in a perfect line—some were up, some were down, some in the middle of the craft. The lights pulsed brighter, dimmer, brighter, dimmer, and then suddenly the craft was far away. It went north. It paused in the distance, and then vanished in a second.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At this point, I’m honestly freaking out, wondering what I just saw. Again, I am in the travelling lane, and the thing I just saw was on my right over the valley. The valley ends and I’m driving, not a full 30 seconds have even passed, and a coyote comes flying out of the grass on my right side. I’ve never seen a coyote, or any animal ever run that fast before—it was white, with a yellow tint to it. Think of a white lab—that color.  I had absolutely no warning and it appeared just a few feet in front of my car, racing, not being chased and not chasing anything, no other coyotes around (and don’t they run in packs generally?) and I had absolutely no time or room to react. I was forced into hitting it, going 65 as I was on the highway. Again, I have a new car—it’s a sturdy car. It hit so hard that my front quarter panel went flying off. I called the cops right away fearing for the poor coyote maybe still in the road and to report the incident.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The cops showed up and couldn’t find this coyote I hit going 65 anywhere. Whatever scared it scared it so bad it couldn’t stop running. I hit hard. My quarter panel was way across the other side of the highway.  In order to tell the cops my location,  this all took place around the 48th and 49th mile marker on Interstate 91. The valley is within the 48th, going northbound, and I hit the coyote just before a merging area on the 49th.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I can’t help but feel these two cases are related. I told the cops about what I had seen and they totally dismissed me and even started talking to each other over me, acting like I was a crazy person. I had just hit an animal, it was 1 am just about, and I was shaking harder than I ever shook on my life—they probably assumed I was on drugs. Whatever the case, they totally dismissed me and I’m not too excited about that—people tend to not take you very seriously about paranormal happenings. Now, I’m extremely anxious being outside at night, especially when it’s clear out. This event scared me terribly—I’m far more upset over the UFO than the coyote, though I feel really bad for the coyote. Looking back, I also wish I had the radio on. I had a CD playing and turned it down when I noticed something amiss. I wonder if that would have been affected.<n>
3/31/12 00:15|Hiddenite|NC|Unknown|5 hours|Green/white lights of several UFOs seen by two private citizens.|4/18/12|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/088/S88147.html|8|ndxe201203| Green/white lights of several UFOs seen by two private citizens.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first I thought the first one I saw was a bright star but suddenly it darted to LSF in one quick surge. I began watching and noticed it changed colors from green to bright white. There appeared to be a grouping of lights in one vehicle but they all seemed to be one light also. The vehicle appeared to be hovering for a while then moving to another location within a pattern. The light constantly moved as in a searching pattern. As I watched for over an hour I saw other vehicles appear at a distance then disappear.  I finally went to bed with my feelings unresolved about what I was seeing.  I arose at 5:39 this morning and walked out the back door to see if it was still there.  It appeared to be gone when all of a sudden a bright flash almost directly overhead showed the vehicle was still here but in a different.  At that point there were sudden flashes of other vehicles scattered throughout the general area.  I have never seen a UFO before and feel pretty i! gnorant about reporting my sighting, but I am positive of what I have seen this night and am thoroughly confused to the duration and number of vehicles I have seen.  I hope this report can be of some small help to your organization.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

After dark, we began using Gen 1, Gen 3 and FLIR night vision equipment.  We had approximately a 10 foot figure approach to within 75 yards of us caught on the FLIR scope.  We obtained night vision video of this subject that appeared to be female.<n> <n><n> <n><n> During this time, I noticed about 6 delta shaped lights hovering above the trees.  They had lights changing colors from white, to red, to blue, to green at different times.  When I pointed this out to the other two researchers, the lights seemed to dodge behind the trees to avoid being seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Later, I was reviewing my Gen 1 night vision videos and found a clip of these short, bubble headed subjects peering over our four wheelers.  They look freaky in the video and nothing like a Bigfoot, for which I do have video of on other dates and times.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My wife and her cousin have been with me when they also saw these lights in the sky hovering over Bigfoot activity areas.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I’m not trying to sensationalize anything, just relating the truth of things I have witnessed and documented.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I look at the moon to see if it is full that night. It was but something was beside the moon just sitting there. I look at it to see if it was a plane or maybe a star. But it just did not look right.  My phone was on the charger in the house. I ran in the house and when I came out, it was there same spot.  I took many pictures and a video. I was amazed but I know this was not right.  The next night I look up again and nothing was there. I put the pictures on Facebook.  Someone said to me it was not a star because it is on the wrong side, and it the star would be visible in Oct.<n>
3/30/12 22:45|Sandy|UT|Triangle|1/2 hour|We followed a small, silent object with two lights fairly close to us in Sandy, Utah.|5/13/12|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/088/S88129.html|11|ndxe201203| We followed a small, silent object with two lights fairly close to us in Sandy, Utah.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On March 30th at about 10:45 pm in Sandy, Utah, my sister, brother-in-law and I left a movie and were walking to our car.  My brother-in-law asked “what’s that?” pointing upward.  We looked up and saw a few lights fairly close.  They looked to be on two edges of a triangular object.  They looked to be in conical shapes hooked to the edges of the object.  One light turned off and back on a few times while we saw it.  There was not a regular pattern or timing to the flash of this light and only one of them ever went out.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It didn’t seem to be very large or very far away and it was completely silent.  Airplanes did pass by and were further away though we could still hear them and their lights blinked regularly and were red and bluish.  The lights on this object were a bright bluish white.  It seemed to move almost like it was drifting (like a balloon), but then it would stop, and hover before continuing on in another direction.  I took a video on my iphone and a few pictures before we got in my car and followed the lights to another spot, trying to get closer where we took more video and photos.   We went to even a third location where it seemed the closest, descending and stopping, hovering almost right over us before taking off and rising again, heading back toward the original spot we saw it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We tried following it back but lost it as it was so low against the skyline and other lights were so bright.  We are not sure what it is but we just want to know what it was.  We are upset we lost it and were hoping to see it again.  At times it seemed aware of us and coming towards us, but I never felt any threat from it.  Any help to figure out this situation would be greatly appreciated.<n>

I was facing north when a movement in the sky caught my eye.  I saw a large red-orange fireball with a white tail that was attached (did not leave a trail) sailing across the sky, parallel with the ground moving east to west.  It was low enough in the sky for me to determine it was not an airplane or helicopter.  It made absolutely no noise whatsoever. It disappeared from my view (blocked by my house)so I grabbed my dog &amp; ran out front but it was already gone.  I have no clue what it was &amp; there were no reports in the local newspaper.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was a clear night and pretty much a normal night until this event happened.  All of a sudden we pull onto a dead end (no outlet) road and saw something bizarre.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There were about one hundred deer in the last yard on the left.  The man or woman in the house were looking out into their yard.  We all felt that it was odd seeing so many deer at a time.  Most of the time we would only see deer while they crossed over the loose asphalt.   As we pulled a 180 degree turn in the dead end is when we all saw what was in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was a bright light but not bright enough to hurt your eyes which was stationary in one place.  As we kept driving, the road came up to a fork and we took the left.   We were traveling pretty slowly around 15 – 20 miles per hour.  The light was still as bright and in the same spot.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The next amazing event was that the light shot off in the direction we headed to the right of us.  The altitude of the light in the sky was about 35 or 40 degrees.  Then POOF, it was gone.  It was almost unexplainable.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object was in the same spot for at least 3 minutes and flew across the whole right side of our vision.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

3/30/12 21:15|Story City|IA|Formation||Group of 4 red/orange lights, becoming 3 lights then disappearing into darkness of space|5/13/12|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/088/S88133.html|17|ndxe201203| Group of 4 red/orange lights, becoming 3 lights then disappearing into darkness of space<n> <n><n> <n><n> At approximately 9:15pm CST I walked out to my back patio, looked to the sky and was astonished. There was a group of four lights (all red/orange in color) moving quickly towards the Northeast.  I’ve never seen anything quite like this.  The lights were aligned in top-bottom arrangement, where the bottom three lights formed a triangular shape.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As they progressed further away, the second light from the bottom faded out and the bottom light seemed to move and take its place, forming three distinct lights in a line (although they seemed independent from one another and moving slightly on their own will).  Then, even more amazingly, the group of lights clearly changed direction towards space!  In a matter of just about a minute, they began their descent and disappeared from the naked eye.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have observed some strange lights in the past but never a group.  I did not have any video equipment to catch this sighting but it leaves no doubt in my mind that there is something unexplained flying in our planet’s skies.  The total duration of this sighting was just less than ten minutes.  I am 30 years old and born and raised in the area.  I work nights and have a lot of experience seeing the night sky in the area.  What I witnessed last night was completely unidentifiable and there is nothing I can compare it to.<n>

It was clearly not a star or planet, as it was about 3 or 4 times larger and brighter even than Venus in the west sky (which is blazing right now). Also, it had a different glow to it, almost like it was oscillating differently or something. Something stood out about it, and I almost crashed as I pulled into the grocery store parking lot.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I got out of my car and my eyes were glued to it. I didn&#39;t care that people were walking around me, probably thinking I was a mad man. I just watched it. I found a star near it as a point of reference and in about 2 minutes it traveled around an inch in the northern direction, after which I noticed it fading. The oscillation was also changing and it&#39;s vibration was reducing as well, so it wasn&#39;t like it was just turning a light off, it was getting farther away.  At first I was just amazed, like how could this be happening? It got smaller, then exponentially like it was traveling away from earth until it was too far away to see.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;m just amazed. Is there any logical explanation for this?  Something explainable?  There were no clouds in the sky, and if it had have been atmospheric, the dim star I used as a point of reference would have also faded, and eventually the bright light would have come back, but that was not the case.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In the past I&#39;ve gotten really excited, my heart has started pounding when I saw something I thought was a space ship of some type, and then I see that it&#39;s a plane or a helicopter or a wedding party has released lanterns or something, and I feel embarrassed.  This time I just kept my composure and it blew my mind.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;ve never been so sure that what I saw was the real deal. Is there any way to check if others saw the same thing as me?<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.  PD))<n>

First I thought it was some people wearing bright clothe while working in the field.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Seconds later I realised that this object was moving around the field in random direction so I thought it was maybe some kind of plastic shopping bag flying around with the wind.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I dropped off my heavy backpack and puled out my video camera, and zoomed in to the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was around 12:15 UK time and air condition wore qua-it fogy and/or cloudy. Tan Hill is 294 m above see level and this (where filming took place) approximate location is at around 250 m above see level I guess.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Due to the cloudy and the sunny condition, visibility was very poor and I could barely see anything on my camera LSD monitor.<n> <n><n> <n><n> For those who photograph may know that mixture of sun and thin cloud can make you blind at some point, and this condition in photographic terms called spread light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Also was qua-it difficult to find farm building it self on the monitor, but I was very happy this building was there, which I used as orientation point to zoom in.<n> <n><n> <n><n> For better framing I kept looking in to the field and back to the monitor, and soon this object looked like have melted out from my view, perhaps plummet in to the ground?<n> <n><n> <n><n> Short video available on:  http://youtu.be/a7uKItk82F0<n>

At the time I only thought this was a farmer wearing white clothe while working.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Lighting conditions wore between thin clouds and light fog, and was qua-it difficult to understand this object from grater distance. I puled my camera out and start filming. When I looked at my camera monitor I could barely see anything including farm building.

At approximately 4:00am I noticed a large dark shape, almost like smoke on the building directly next to the health center on the roof.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object or entity appeared to glide along the roof top and stop for a few moments. I could see what looked like eyes and got the distinct impression whatever it was new I was looking at. After about 3 min of observing it, it gained a tremendous amount of speed and jumped or flew off the building. I than observed it. I’m not sure if the object was generating light or if it was the reflection of the moon on it, but it was a observable bright light flying in an odd pattern of an up and down, side to side motion. It was headed in the direction of Milton and Quincy.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I than rejoined my co-worker in her car and told her I just saw the strangest thing. She replied “you mean that dark, misty, looking thing that was on that roof over there?” I couldn’t believe she saw the exact same thing and described it before I even said anything.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I thought to myself, how unusual is that? Having watched satellites transverse the sky on countless occasions I had never seen two travelling together.   From my vantage point to the point in the sky they were about 1” apart but clearly moving together.  They seemed to travel slower than most other satellites I had observed but I surmised this was because of their unusually  high altitude. (which I suspected was higher than all the others I have seen).  As they moved toward the NW and  the sun was still below the horizon I could see the reflection of what looked like a silver thread appear between the two satellites, lites, ufo’s or whatever you want to call them.  At first not believing my eyes I carefully studied what I was seeing  with great interest for about 1 1/2 minutes until I could no longer see the objects or the! thread connecting them as they moved out of view.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was left with the impression/conclusion that what I had seen were two satellites connected by  some kind of tether, cable etc. It was clearly glistening in the sunlight from over the horizon.   After some further thought I surmised that perhaps it was some kind of space experiment reminding me of the unsuccessful shuttle experiment with the tether to create/capture inductive power in orbit. At the obvious high altitude of the objects, the distance of the tether connecting them had to be immense since I could perceive it as approximately 1 inch in distance from my vantage point.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was an interesting observation and I am pleased I could share it with you, Best Regards.<n>

Faded out completely when plane flew close to it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At approximately 11:00pm-11:30pm my roommate and I observed a light over the mountains in the north-west sky over Morehead State University from our dorm room.  We thought that it was just a pulsating star at first, but then we realized it was moving very slowly towards a cellphone tower on the hill. It would occasionally dip below the mountains then fly upwards back into the sky. The bright golden light would shine extremely bright and then get very dim to the point that we could barely see it, and then it would get very bright again.  At some point during the night another strange thing occurred.  A plane flew within the vicinity of the glowing light and the light disappeared entirely until the plane was gone.  After the plane had left, the light reappeared for a few more minutes until fading out completely.  The light never appeared again during the night.  This was a very strange occurrence and my roommate and I swear it wasn’t a plane or a star because ! of the way it moved.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

On approaching the Westchester County Airport in, Harrison, NY, I noticed flashing lights, ahead of me, above the clouds in the Northwest sky.  I assumed they were lights from the airport.  Upon passing the airport I continued to see the lights ahead of me. There was no determinable shape, or object but they looked more like wisps of smoke.  As the trip continued, we saw 5 lights, ahead if us, in what appeared to be in formation, with one brighter light in the center surrounded by 4 other lights.  My best description of this was it looked like a flying aces air show. The 4 lights would emerge with the center light and then break off again in formation.  At one point 2 of the lights were on my driver side and 2 I could see in the rear view mirror.  I thought we were finally passing them when they traveled again in front of us.  After approximately 20 miles we lost sight of them.  I am a retired police officer and my wife a r! etired nurse both skeptical of UFO&#39;s but this experience changed our view on such phenomena.<n>

I have lived in rural areas my whole life and have never seen anything like this. I am familiar with airplanes and jets, and there is an airport north of my apartment, but I&#39;ve observed several planes flying to this airport tonight and they were much different from this object, not to mention flying in a completely different direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Tonight at about 8:29pm, I heard what sounded like an aircraft flying very low and approaching my apartment. The noise was higher in pitch than any aircraft noise I&#39;d ever heard, but a constant whooshing hum. I went outside to see it, because it definitely sounded like it would be in my line of sight, and it was indeed.  The sun had set but the sky was still a light royal blue color, so I could easily make out the solid kite shape of the object: like a diamond, but with a flatter front and elongated back rather than equal sides and angles.  It was gray and had a number of white and yellowish lights. Several lined the front (maybe around 5 to 7), and one was at each corner, and a few of them (if not all) blinked. I believe the lights were shaped differently: some were rectangular while others more round.  The object wasn&#39;t extremely low, but low for an aircraft.  It was flying pretty directly east, and I couldn&#39;t tell whether or not it was ascending or descending, though it seeme! d to hold a steady altitude.  The object looked familiar to me (probably because of photos on TV of similar-looking UFOs), so I wasn&#39;t alarmed upon seeing it, but I was extremely curious and watched it intently.  As it passed behind trees and then the hills that blocked it from my sight, it seemed to turn slightly north.  Even after I could no longer see it, I could still hear it, though the sound decreased out of hearing at a constant rate (meaning it didn&#39;t abruptly cut off as though it had landed).<n>

I use the example of the handle of the big dipper, the last two stars at the bottom of the handle farthest from the bowl, the width between them, were flashing randomly (example 1 and 3 then 3 and 5 and 5 and 7 then repeating)  To me is seemed as it was a cruising mode like when you have on your parking lights while driving to allow you to be seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I ran around my house to grab my camera, though in the excitement I zoomed in instead of out.  So it looks like a single light flashing.  I ran over to my tenants house to have him come out and see.

Myself and other students awaiting the bus were watching the stars. We had watched several stars move across the sky as the earth rotated. We knew they were stars because of their twinkle and the direction they were moving across the sky. We also saw a plane flying south and we could hear the sound and see the lights blinking.  Then over a thin sheet of clouds we saw a small light. It seemed to be a satellite.  As it passed over another sheet of clouds is disappeared.  It was moving relatively fast compared to the stars and planes we had seen. Also it was not moving the same direction as the stars due to the rotation of the Earth.  Within a few seconds the same light appeared again and had turned a 110 degree direction. We all witnessed the light as it moved slowly then stopped.  It moved and stopped several times. It moved over another sheet of clouds and we could not see it. We were all pretty confused by what we saw.  However, we know for sure it was not a helicopter because of how high the light was.  There were no sounds or other lights with it. The light never blinked or turned colors.<n>

It appeared out of no where and, seemed to hover for a minute or two and then seemed to change into a smaller circle and, started moving back and forth and in a circle motion.  The sky was a bit hazy but it was still dark and that’s why the object stood out. I couldn’t believe it.  I noticed some houses high on the canyon hill had their house lights on and I thought to myself, surely they must have seen this object as well, or anyone traveling west on Barham Blvd. at this time had to see it. It hovered for about five minutes if that, and seemed to travel south. It disappeared. I wanted to grab my IPhone and take a picture but there wasn’t enough time for me to take a picture before the object was no longer ! visible. I know someone had to see this object as it seemed to be flying much lower than a commercial airplane does. Would be great if someone else can post here about this object. I’m a university professor.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))<n>

Although the second one was moving a bit quicker, it quickly released another craft of the same kind as it was moving.this really stunned me as the second two crafts moved out of my sight another craft quickly appeared and then two more crafts followed the one. but the best description that i seen was on the last craft as it was much closer in range.  I was able to identify that it was a triangular shaped craft with one huge light in each corner of the triangle it emitted a light formation around the craft as it was moving.  This shocked event shocked me very much<n>

Immediately, I noticed several, strange, colorful objects in a formation in the Eastern sky and informed my girlfriend of it and to watch this as well.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Each of the five individual objects in the formation, emitted, random colored displays of blinking lights, red, violet, blue, green and yellow as each object maintained an ascending, staggered, stair-step “Staircase-like” ariel formation of one object after another.   Each object seemingly appeared to be &#34;disc-like&#34; in shape, and each was tilted at a 45 degree angle (to the right) and each object was pretty equally spaced apart within the formation as they appeared to remain stationary in the night sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What I also noticed at the same angle of ascension to this formation, higher-up in the sky there appeared to be a single solid red light that seemingly hovered there.  I looked above and around the red light to determine if there was any associated structure but could not see anything but the suspended red light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> During the first 15 minutes of this events observation it became apparent these five objects were slowly descending, one-by-one while maintaining their angle and group formation.  The red light above did not descend with the other objects and maintained its position as the objects continued to descend far behind a high-rise building in the distance from where our 6th floor, Eastern facing apartment is located in the city.<n> <n><n> <n><n> One by one the objects disappeared behind the building in the foreground and seemingly into the mountains in the distance.  As the last object descended, out of view the red light moved off into the distance into the mountains maintaining a level departure before it suddenly performed some quick and erratic maneuvers, during the last few seconds of observation in the distance and disappeared from view in the mountains.<n> <n><n> <n><n> During this sighting we tried several times to take pictures and record the event onto digital devices including a Blackberry, iPhone and an Nikon digital camera, but the objects could not be seen in the view finders.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I used my thumb at arm’s length to evaluate the size of each &#34;disc-like&#34; object in the formation and established that each object was about ½ of one thumb nail in size from my distance to the objects.  I estimate the objects were at least 4-5 kilometers away from our location and the objects when they were first noticed were all high above the height of the 30-story building they all eventually descended behind in the distance, 50 minutes later.<n> <n><n> <n><n> To the East of our location in the background is the Tianshan mountain range that stretches around the city of Urumqi to the East is easily visible during the day from this location, so it’s likely from our observation point to be the region or area where these objects descended too.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke via telephone (Skype) with this witness, and he sounded to us to be quite sincere and credible.  We asked whether he thought that the objects might be so-called &#34;Chinese lanterns,&#34; and he unambiguously stated that his impression was that they were not lanterns.  PD))<n>

I live in Bozeman, Montana.  On the night of March 27th, 2012, I witnessed what I am positive to have been a UFO.  I went outside on my deck at 10:45 p.m. to smoke a cigarette before going to bed and I looked up into the clear night sky as I usually do.  What I saw dumbfounded me!  As I was looking southward, toward the Hyalite foothills from my house off of College Street, I saw three lights, they appeared red and white in color, and they were in a long line apart from one another.  The lights were blinking simultaneously, the first one, then the second one, then the third one, in that order over and over.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I opened my front door and told my fiancé, to please come outside to see what I was witnessing.  He came out and witnessed the phenomenon too and he said, “What is that?”   Then he exclaimed, “It’s a UFO!” We both watched as this UFO very slowly moved east, towards the MSU campus until it disappeared from our sight, approximately two or three minutes, it was all over by 10:50 pm.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This UFO appeared to be at least a football field long in length, from where we were standing.  I know that the Hyalite foothills are only 8 miles from our place, so it was definitely in front of the mountains and it looked very close, like it could be right above College Street, which is only 200 or 300 yards from our house.  We watched the lights blinking and the UFO was completely silent.  We knew it wasn’t an airplane, the lights were spaced too far apart, and airplanes are not that big, also, helicopters make alot of noise!  Plus, I know the flight pattern for the airplanes that fly overhead to the Gallatin Field Airport in Belgrade, and this object definitely wasn’t going that direction!  He also ran back into our house and grabbed his phone and tried to take a video of this event but when he turned on the video camera it kept shutting down! If only we could have captured this on video, nevertheless, having lived in beautiful Big Sky Country Montana my entire life and being the avid “sky-watcher” woman I am, I have never experienced anything like this before.  I did call our local radio station, The Eagle 105.7 &amp; 104.7 FM and the guy I talked to said that he also saw the UFO!  He said that it was triangular in shape and black in color.  I couldn’t make that out when I witnessed it, but it appeared BIG!  Anyhow, they did announce it on the radio.  I have yet to hear how many folks called in to say they saw it too.  I am a little freaked out by the whole experience, and I haven’t felt good since.  Maybe it’s the flu, but my headache won’t go away.  I have seen what I thought to be UFO’s in the past, especially up at our family cabin in West Yellowstone, but they were always pretty far away.  This one however, was too close for comfort!!  Thanks for sharing on this website and thanks to Peter Davenport for be! lieving in my story.  My fiancé is also going to post his view of the story soon.  I will be watching the Montana sky alot more!<n>

This is not a plane either because I could see the landing lights of a plane that was approaching form the south to Gallitan Airfield.  The plane appeared to be above the object due to the eachs relative position to the other.

Taking a back road towards 421. In the sky barely above the tree lines, we saw lights. They were in 3 groupings of 2 forming a spread out triangle.  The pairs were made up of a red light and a white light; the red light would blink then the white.  The 3 groups were synchronized. I thought it was radio towers but they were too low and when we traveled back on Thursday, they were gone.  We thought it might be helicopters but the lights were not moving AT ALL!  They stood in place the entire time we were driving down the side road, 5 – 10 minutes and were there when we turned away.  Also, the lights were to close for it to be 3 helicopters hovering next to each other but to far apart for it to be one helicopter.  If it was one craft then it was huge!  And I do not know of any floating airplanes.  We were totally freaked out and could not for the life of us figure out what it was.<n>

Then I realized they were in the sky going west to east, across the road I was driving on, very low.  The lights were close together but not too close.  Enough to say fit 3 or 4 more lights the same size but were perfectly.  Parallel to each other And the lights did not fade out they just turned off in a manor that is unusual,  giving the time span in between each blink.  No sound of an aircraft was heard. Nor was there any glare Protruding or emitting from the lights.  The lights proceeded to go behide the tree tops in the direction of the mountains. I wanted to follow to get a closer look at what it really was but was afraid what I might see to be what I thought it was.  Plus I had my 9 yr old in the back and didn&#39;t what to draw his attention to it.  So I turned down Spring st in the opposite direction of the craft. It was still visible as I left it.  On another note I have notice a light like an airport spot light or something coming from behind these mountains that I&#39;ve never seen before. Strobing the sky.  That was the night before and the night prior.  But when I went home I looked at the mountains and didn&#39;t see that light nor did I tonight.<n>

We decided to grab a slice of pie and a soda pop at the food stand stationed outside in the parking lot.  After grabbing our little mid evening snack, we proceeded to walk back to the truck to head back to the job site.  As we were walking towards my truck, Jrod noticed a strange craft in the sky northwest of us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first, I was convinced that the craft was a chopper, but soon realized that its movements were too &#34;smooth&#34; and that it was the shape of a triangle.   At this point, Jrod became a bit frightened and wanted to go. I, on the other hand, was completely fascinated and took a few more moments to study the strange craft. It was NOT moving at a high velocity and was moving in a very &#34;smooth&#34; motion. There was no noticeable sound and it seemed to act as though it was searching for something.  The only other relevant in! formation I can provided is that Sikorsky Aircraft is only located 10 miles away. Maybe this craft was one of there toys........I just don&#39;t know since I have no education in the subject of Ufology.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Whatever this craft was, it definitely made a mark on me. Jrod will not talk about what we saw so I have nowhere else to go to speak about this incident. I don&#39;t want to tell other people in my life for fear of being labeled, excuse my french, a &#34;wack ass&#34;. I think that this is also why Jrod would rather just forget about the whole incident.<n>

My husband and I have been watching the sky very closely since our last sighting in broad daylight March 24, 2012, which consisted of a large &#34;flock&#34; of dimming and glowing round objects.  This time, we were observing the night sky on the evening of March 26, 2012 and saw 7 separate objects that looked like stars but were moving at a steady pace high above in the sky.  Between a 25-30 minute period, each one was either traveling North to South or South to North and seemed as though each was following the same specific path.  The second starry object to be seen was traveling South, and emitted a flash of light a little further ahead of it, so I thought maybe it was a satellite taking a picture, as it looked like a camera flash.  The 5th object was traveling North, and when it was directly above our home my husband flashed a light on &amp; off to see if it would notice.  In all seriousness, the object slowed to a near stop, brightened tremendously, then dimmed and continued it&#39;s course!   We feel very special seeing this activity, though we don&#39;t really know or understand what it is.  We saw 4 different planes travel through, 2 going East to West and 2 going South to North, but the little star like objects weren&#39;t present at the time the planes were out.<n>

Just pass 7th standard road exit.  Saw bright light over freeway.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first did not think anything.  But then as I drove north on the freeway, I noticed the light did not move and remain bright.  The sun was still out.  Clear day no clouds.  A few minutes into the drive, maybe 10 miles out of Bakersfield.  I noticed the bright light was still above the freeway and at that time I asked my son, who was in the passenger seat if he saw the bright light.  He stated he had been looking at it for some time now and notice it had not moved.  My younger son who was in the back seat sat forward to see and stated that the light appeared to be hovering over the freeway 99.  We kept looking at the bright light and then as we got closed, noticed now two bright lights and still hovering.  At that point my sons said what is it.  It is not a plane or helicopter.  It is too low and it is not moving.  It appear to be ho! vering over a pass.  I started to slow down to 50 miles and kept looking at the light and notice the cars behind me also slowed down.  As I drove near the upcoming pass,it appeared to be right above the freeway pass. I notice the object was a dull grey with two bright lights and no sound.  My son tried to get a photo with his phone but was not able.  I slowed down to see the object which now was on my right side and hovering over an orchard off the freeway just before the exit.  We were maybe 8 minutes from the Lerdo exit towards Shafter.  We tried to see what it was.  We exited and looked towards my right side above the trees.  As we looked back, it was gone.  No noise.  It hovered for a good 12 minutes over the freeway.  First one big white bright light and then two bright lights, It looked like boom-a-rang shape.  Grey in color with bright lights on the ends.  We could not identify the object.  It was not an airplane.  Do not believe an airplane can stay in one spot for t! hat long.

It seemed to be moving to the right, as I kept studying it, it seemed as if it has a very long object of some sort sticking out of it, could just be my eyes doing it from squinting, but as I did squint...that seemed to even get more defined...not sure whats going on here.<n>

He got out of his car and asked me &#34;did you see that?&#34; I had just gotten outside so I asked him what he was talking about and he said he saw a bright flash of light shoot down from the sky like a comet. I then noticed a bright orange light above the River Raisin. I ran and got my binoculars and we hurried to the backyard. I live on the riverfront, and the light was west of us. It was flying very low, approximately at the tree line. We could see the light reflecting on the river as well. It began coming closer, in our direction. As it got closer, we could see on the front of the craft, it had 3 square or rectangle shaped lights, in a triangle formation. The lights appeared to be white as it came closer to us. It got really close before it moved behind the tree line across the river from us and disappeared behind the trees. Another craft just like it was approaching f! rom the east, also above the river. It did the same thing as the other one- moved across the river and behind the trees. At that point we could see the light behind the trees and they were flying very low. They both disappeared and we didn&#39;t know where they went after that.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am unsure of the shape of the crafts. All we could really tell was that the lights were in a triangle formation with two on the bottom and one light above. But we couldn&#39;t really see what the shape of the whole thing looked like. I just know that when we first saw them, they just looked like orange lights, but as they came closer, the lights were white.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The object slowly moved over them and our house.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They stated that the object did not make any noise at all and before it went out of sight over our house a little light came from the object and hit my fiance in the head and he instantly had a migrane.<n> <n><n> <n><n> He stated that his cell phone stopped working for 20 minutes after this happened.  He called his cell  phone provider and they stated that he payed his bill and it should be working fine.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After this happened he was really freaked out. About 10 minutes later he saw an object in the grass that he mentioned moved at the speed of light-moved very fast.  I didnt really know what to think when he told me this.

I shouted and simultaneously slammed on my breaks to an almost complete stop because it scared me.  The two passengers in my car did not see the object in time and were probably more focused on my erratic driving and shouting to see it in time.  I am an avid sky watcher have seen bolides, meteors and know my stars well.  This was nothing like anything I have ever seen before.  It seemed different because the light was constant with no tail and no fade.  The object seemed to drop faster than free fall and disappeared as the tree line near the hospital shielded my view.<n>

It was the color of a flame - the illumination remained consistent - except that, looking through binoculars, it appeared as if the &#34;light&#34; was moving from left to right - as if scanning the sky, in a consistent pattern.  The craft made no sound, and appeared to be at an altitude of approx. 2,000 - 3,000 feet.  When the craft was directly overhead, the light was no longer visible, however it was apparent that it was circular in shape.  As the craft moved from directly overhead southward, a dim light was visible, but only a fraction of what was emanating from the &#34;front.&#34;  After the initial craft disappeared in the south sky, a second craft appeared moving in the same north - south track, at the same rate of speed.  Both crafts were identical in appearance.  Neither craft had any blinking lights, nor were they moving at a speed that would be required by an airplane to remain aloft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I took a few pictures of the crafts, only one of which turned out decent.  I also filmed some HD video, however, because it was dark, it did not turn out well.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The first craft was witnessed by my wife and myself.  The second craft was also witnessed by our nextdoor neighbors (who we invited to watch with us).<n> <n><n> <n><n>

For some reason, I went outside a second time, looked towards the same direction towards the moon and I seen another object following the same path as the other, and that&#39;s when I pulled out camera.<n>

Therefore, I was watching the sky up, but facing North-Northeast (Ursa Major) direction to be more precise.<n> <n><n> <n><n> That&#39;s when I noticed a single flying object crossing the sky in the same direction (Ursa Major) and disappearing behind the club house.  Time was between 5:30-5:45pm EST.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Sighting took about 3 seconds, it almost looked like a shooting star (but a bit slower) and the most intriguing part was its shape and rate of speed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It looked like an F-22, but more star shaped (7 points), grayish/light blue almost blending with the sky color, traveling between 20,000-30,000ft altitude, extremely fast I would estimate over 3,000mph given its height and the sighting duration but no sound, no trail, nor lights.  Measured 2/16 inches (squared).<n> <n><n> <n><n> And given my background in the space program I can certainly say I have never seeing something like that before.  I have seeing in naked eyes satellites, space station, space shuttles, shooting stars but this sighting does not compare to anything technological that I know of.  And fighter planes usually scream in the air, and commercial planes you can still hear them.<n>

It was traveling east 100 degrees at about 15-20 miles an hour. Too slow for an air plane unless it was an ultralite but this ball put off so much light that it would have illuminated any craft around it. I knew no one would believe me without evidence so I ran back into the house and grabbed my video camera and got 5 min. of video of it going away from me until it went out of sight. It&#39;s an analog Hi-8 and I found a company in Kennewick called Sight &amp; Sound Service that put it on DVD so I can upload it on the internet. I have uploaded it to YouTube and this is the link. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v! =QMLjbFHNCKw&amp;feature=youtu.be I have talked to our Pasco air port and they said that they would not have record of radar because they shut down at 10:00pm. A few days later doing the same thing with the dog I saw a white orb come out of Burbank heights Arleen’s addition across the river towards Finley Wa. It was traveling very low and like a rocket. I haven&#39;t seen anything move that fast. It moved so fast I didn&#39;t even have time to turn on the camera I was holding. The object that I did get video of was right over me and it was putting out so much light that it actually would hurt your eyes if you stared at it to long. I had my camera in night vision mode so that it would film it at night so it looks white-green on film but it was really orange-red and maybe a hint of yellow. I didn&#39;t have time to grab my tripod so it&#39;s a bit shaky. I ran over to my fence and tried to stabilize the camera but it still moves around on the screen. This thing made no noise at all.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

NO noise heard.  No aircraft wing, tail, or landing lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At or near the Kansas City Metropolitan Community College Maple Woods Campus, Object seemed to be gaining elevation and still heading south.  No other lights but the consistent red-orange glow was observed.   We can observe elevation due to a consistent white glow of the city that goes about from the horizon to about 30 degrees above horizon while facing due south.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At or near the final location of spotting, the item seemed to be turning due east.  Then item disappeared.   Final size was about the size of a USA 10 piece &#34;Dime&#34; that is placed 12&#34; from a human eye with 20/20 vision.    No shape of a craft was observed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Spotted it all most directly overhead near the initial location above.   Initial thought it was a shooting star, but after watching it for 20 seconds I realized it was not.   My father was watching the documentary about the guy who got eaten by the grizzly bears and I called him out to observe it with me.  We watched the object for about a full minute or more together as it moved across the sky.   We thought it was a burning plane about the size of a Boeing 737, but realized it was gaining height and  there was NO aircraft wing or tail lights.  Looked more like we were looking directly at the exhaust of a rocket.   No exhaust cloud was observed.<n>

Friends were outside our vehicle in the parking lot and we mentioned the lights to them.  One of our friends took a picture with her cell phone.  The lights were equal-distant apart from each other as if in formation.  They were steady and not flashing during the whole sighting.  They then turned to the South and looped back in a Southwesterly direction and upward until they disappeared.  They stayed in formation the entire time.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

We saw a triangular shape in the sky that was moving slowly that was a bright base color of red that had three yellowish lights at each corner of the object. The lights were constant with no discernible pulsations nor was there any engine noise heard. It moved in a straight line, stopped a few times, appearing to shift slightly to the left and/or right while stopped. It then kept slowly moving and simply winked out after about four minutes of observation. It was cloudy that night so we could not tell if it disappeared into the clouds to create this slow winking out.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Living near an airport, I see aircraft coming and going all the time and am close enough to make out some of the details, especially flashing lights. My first thought was that this might be a jet with an engine fire. However, the object moved steadily past the airport at a rate faster than any of the other aircraft in the area. The object made no sound (I could hear other aircraft - but not this object). It also lacked any distinct navigation lights - just a steady yellow fire-like glow. It was this fact that seemed the most unusual - that an aircraft was traveling through commercial airspace without proper red/green/white lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I watched the object for a minute or two as it headed South toward the horizon, until it was too far away to see. I doubt I&#39;ll ever know exactly what it was that I saw, but am posting this account in case others witnessed the same thing.<n>

It started as two visible lights zig-zag from one another traveling in a southwestern direction.  The lights did not appear to have any type of vibration to them, and appeared to alternate between red/white light fast enough to appear orangish in color.  The objects continued southwest to directly east of my residence where I noticed several more on the horizon following.  The objects were traveling slowly, and the lights on the first two to three faded as they reached an area east of my residence.  The other objects continued in the same direction, extinguishing their lights at different locations in the sky, not being seen again.  At this time I noticed what appeared to be an airliner in a east to west flight pattern extremely high in the sky.  The last two objects were on a path to intersect visually at some point above my location with the airliner.  The last two o! bjects both slowed or possibly stopped in the air, and made a very smooth vertical climb, and extinguished their lights not to be seen again before reaching an intersecting point with the airliner.  There was absolutely no noise from these objects at all, and they were possibly around 1000 to 2000 feet AGL.  The night sky is clear, there is a partial moon, and many stars tonight.  The temperature is in the upper 30&#39;s to low 40&#39;s, and a slight breeze.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

At first it looked moved like a police helicopter, but the odd thing about it, it flickered like a flame.  My wife noted the light had a conical shape with the top of the cone pointing upward and the light faded at the tip of the cone.   I told my wife it looked like something was on fire and it might be a meteor or a piece of space junk.  We pulled over and kept watching it.  It was headed slowly in a NE direction.  As we watched it, it made a turn and started heading in a due South direction.  We got back on 141 since we were close to home and I wanted to get my binoculars to get a better look.  Unfortunately, as I drove into my driveway I noticed it was getting much smaller and had changed directions again and was heading back in the NE direction.   Within a second or two, the light had gotten s! o faint I could barely see it then it appeared to gain altitude and was gone.  I watched for a few more minutes but never saw it again.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Noticed 6 Circular Dull Flash light Objects (UFO) with one Big Circle at the center and rest 4 Normal bright Circles at each corner of Big Circle and another Small Sparkling Oval Shaped UFO leading direction to follow my car.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I started noticing it when I took right onto US-13 S/Bristol Pike merging I-95S. 6 Circles followed my direction and small sparkling UFO was leading big ones. One the way it started raining, though I missed it, when rain stopped, again noticed it was following my direction, again I saw it. When I reached Philadelphia Downtown toward I-676 W/US-30, was heading for another pickup from Indian restaurant at University City, near UPenn &amp; again when returning back I saw those UFO&#39;s it did not go away instead it was following me, wherever I go.  At last at 9:30PM I reached home to my Apartments near Philadelphia Museum of Arts,  These Circles were revolving and Circulating above my parking &amp; my apartment, I called my wife to look out for circle from Balcony, she did saw the same circles, now the Big one remained dull and cloudy and we could see only half of it since it was positioned directly above my apartment but we could see rest 4 Circles and one Oval very bright shines ones like a Circular Aircraft - UFO&#39;s. It took a while 15 min approximately after I unloaded my things from my car, it disappeared in sky. Very remarkable experience.<n> <n><n> <n><n> but I don’t have any photos or it never clicked my mind to video record this, All I felt was strange and curious and surprised, I could notice myself I was became very much concentrated on what I was doing even I pushed myself out to call my wife to see from Balcony, I had a feeling of deep meditation and single mind directed on what I was doing at that moment when I got out of my car for unloading. I couldn&#39;t explain anymore or I don’t know how to explain this, it’s an experience.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Worst thing when this incident happened nobody was around me to look at, it’s a perfect time, I am not sure whether others noticed. I was searching for a official site to report this event. Thankyou www.nuforc.org.<n>

At first I thought they were stars, but it was clearly too light out.  They continued to move slowly northward for about 5 to 7 minutes, then they faded from sight, maybe climbing too high to be seen at all.  The larger light stayed stationary when it was directly overhead and when all the small ones were gone the larger light disappeared.<n>

Initially this object went in a westerly direction, before going back heading towards east southerly direction. This object was in the sky heading in an south Easterly direction for approx 1 1/4 hours.  I called Mufon NY director,[moved name/CMS/der], and we reviewed all possible objects via Stellarium, and could find no such objects that matched. I was able to send him footage, as I was on the phone with him (I think I woke him up I called so early...am sorry [moved name/CMS/der]!) I was able to maintain visual contact with this white star like orb.  In that I had no more avail space on my camera memory card, I looked at object right before it disappeared behind treeline on adjacent side of property from where it had originated, and the object appeared to be reflective, and elongated, almost rectangular shaped.  I do not have equip to document telescope visual, only my verbal description.  I have reviewed the footage off camera #2, which also has footage visible of this white orb.  In a still photo, when zoomed in, the object does not appear round as it did to the eye, but more oblong or oval horizontally.  I see white orbs that travel at tremendous rates of speeds, switch directions, intersect other orbs, EVERY night early predawn when it is not overcast.

This is why I contacted your site, as I do stand by my word, and know that what is transpiring is ! obviously NOT normal.  I have compared my sightings to other k! nown obj ects in the sky on each of these occasions, utilizing multiple sources, and have found nothing that matches these anamolies.  I will soon be acquiring a night vision scope with video output to record, and may forward those to you, although I remain reluctant after my conversation with Mr. Davenport. I would like this footage to be reviewed and assessed by an organization who is user friendly, and professional.

The objects hovered in place and pulsated between a orange and orangey red color like a fireball.  At first they appeared still and were in a formation of three across, with the one to the far left appearing to the be slightly larger then the other two. To estimate they were a few thousand feet in the air but appeared to be much larger and brighter then a plane would at this altitude.  It was a quiet and clear night and these craft were silent making no engine noise. Had this been a plane or helicopter at that altitude they would have been close enough to hear engine or propeller noise.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I stopped to watch because it was strange how they were staying in place. I watched for about a minute when the object on the right began moving down and to the right of the other objects.  It moved a good distance away before it came to a stop and hovered in that spot.  They other two objects stayed in the same general location but would move around each other always keeping the same distance apart from one another.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At this point I went inside and got my wife to come outside and witness what I was looking at.  She joined me on the front lawn and we continued to watch them for several more minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object on the far right began to move to the right and then made a change in direction and moved up and to the left, appearing to be far above the other two objects.  They remained in this formation for the most amount of time, the entire duration of this event was about 7 minutes.  The objects came back together in a three across formation again and the object on the right began to dim in brightness.  As it dimmed it began to move to the north, it appeared just as a faint point of light moving north until it vanished from view. As it moved away from the formation the middle object followed suit and dimmed in brightness and moved to the north in the same direction as the first object.  The third object remained for about 30 seconds to a minute after the other two objects were gone from view.  Then same as the other two dimmed in brightness and followed the same direction to the north.<n>

It made a few slight course changes.  I got the impression the craft had some sort of dome on it like an E-2, or had rotors, but there was no sound or feeling of rotor wash.

When it got closer I realized almost immediately that it was some sort of air craft, triangular in shape, with eight or nine lights on the bottom - though none were lit.  I had an exceptional look at the craft and have no doubt in my mind what it was.  The craft was traveling around 30 - 40 mph and was completely silent.  Upon noticing what I was looking at I became frightened and ran inside to alert my girlfriend.   We returned outside a few minutes later to notice two red non flashing lights traveling through the sky at high speeds and moving sporadically with seemingly no effort.  There were also several other aircraft in the sky, but were man made and a helicopter, all of them seemingly headed in the direction of the UFO. It then disappeared and that was the last that I saw of the craft.<n>

More like in a scanning motion.  Then to our surprise we seen an airplane approaching the UFO.  Then the UFO dropped close to the ground at a high rate of doped then shut off its lights, went totally black.  We could no longer see the UFO. A few minutes later the lights came back on once the airplane was out of site.  Only to move back to its original position and shut off its lights again.  We no longer seen the craft after that.<n>

The first view of the craft was a triangle with 1 ea. leading light, and 2 ea. trailing lights.  Although it was dark I was unable to see through the center area of the lights as if it had a body connecting the lights together.  While it was overhead I was able the lights looked as though there was heat radiating from around them.  As the craft continued following the course it was on it seemed to have change of its structure was positioned.  Quickly the forward light shot upward as the two trailing lights seemed to expand their distance between one another.  After the forward light shot upward it began to drop back down.  From the position I was in at this point I was unable to tell if dropped back down to the forward position or if it was now in the trailing position.  The sighting lasted roughly 8 seconds and was not moving in style of aircraft I h! ave seen.

Initially we thought firework residue and realized they were not moving at first from our angle. Next we thought they were airplanes but discarded that notion due to the closeness and amount in same area. They appeared to be moving and we drove closer and as we did the lights went out on them one by one. As we were almost directly under them we could still see a few with lights on and when they burned out we were able to see them traveling because the sky was not that dark tonight. They were traveling from southeast to northwest direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.  PD))<n>

Beneath the aircraft and to the right of it, below it, I witnessed an egg shaped orb hovering about mid-sky.  I went inside to retrieve my binoculars (10x50 5.5 degrees H-15) and I could plainly see two orbs.  One was black and the other was pink or salmon pink in color. The distance was est. 5 miles down range approx.. acute 45 degrees and maintaining position in mid heaven as we faced West. The black orb suddenly dropped near the ground, rose up and then moved rapidly out of view.  The pink orb or egg shaped ball remained in place.  I gave the binoculars to my wife and she watched for about a minute before the pink orb moved rapidly to the lower left of the lens view, and then wisped very quickly to the right of view (northward) and disappeared out of view over the horizon.  Moments later we both saw no less than five objects that appeared to ! be round balls of light.  These balls of light began making erratic movements apparently with no intention.  Several other translucent objects appeared during this time and had the appearance of round luminous plasma, were pinkish in color, and each one had a notch at one end of them.  They looked like a pie with a piece missing.  At times the larger objects would turn facing us and were at least as large as a quarter or a fifty cent piece by binocular view.  Very plain to see. During this time, there appeared to be a meteor storm (streaks in the sky, a sort of white vapor) except for the fact that the streaks moved or skipped vertically in the sky and seemed to defy physics.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After several hours of watching these orbs of light or saucers, moving all over the sky in different directions and formations, and at varied speeds, at about 1:50 pm. what looked like a plasma orb, translucent and pink in color,floating at high altitude and changing shape, began moving toward our house very slowly at about mid sky. Upon reaching a point about a mile(?) downrange and hovering at about 80 degrees overhead, the object suddenly accelerated and flew directly over our neighborhood at what looked to be about 2,000 feet up. Within 5 minutes we heard the sound of F-14&#39;s from the local air base firing up. Moments later Four F-14&#39;s took off in the same northward direction as the craft had. The events may not be related, but it did add a lot of suspense to the situation.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Observed this at about 3 pm An object, triangular in shape, inverting itself. Looked like red lava in the middle encased by pink triangle, pulsating. Moved slowly to the east, just overhead , then vanished.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After five hours of watching these objects they eventually thinned out to just two or three random sightings, and then just stopped showing up altogether at about 5 pm.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This total display lasted 5 hours, from 12 pm. until 5 pm. We heard no sounds associated to these objects and did not meet any aliens, nor do i personally know any aliens.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This accounting is absolute truth as best as I can describe or understand it.<n>

I saw 4 red lights on the sky. they kept blinking for around 20 seconds. Amstelveen is near to Schiphol, one of Europes biggest airports.  I see aeroplanes all the time so i wasn&#39;t scared at all.  But then I realized how far apart they were.  It certainly wasn&#39;t human.  This thing was enormous.  It left a trail of some kind, it was some kind of light i couldn&#39;t identify.  It wasn&#39;t condensed water, which airplanes leave behind.  This was the point where I started to worry. What was this thing. It was incredibly huge.  I was scared as hell but i kept watching the big thing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I really didn&#39;t know what to do so i called a friend. He had seen exactly the same. He told me about him being called by one of his friends. This thing was huge.  I didn&#39;t know what to do. I stared doing research because i couldn&#39;t get back to sleep anyways.  I found some websites but they didn&#39;t have any information on sightings of 4 big red flashing lights.<n>

I was getting ready to go to bed, and as I am an amateur astronomer part of my nightly ritual before I go to bed I look outside my bedroom window and give the skies a visual scan... I do this to see how the sky looks (if it&#39;s clear, what the stars look like, etc..)  My bedroom window looks out towards the Northern sky.  Not much of anything too exciting in that part of the sky, but as I looked out at the clear night sky I noticed something that resembled a bright &#34;star&#34; flickering/pulsing with many colors towards the North.  It was very bright and it was flickering/pulsing like crazy and changing colors... almost like when you look at a star through a telescope on a night where there is a lot of turbulence in the atmosphere.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I immediately knew that this was NOT a star, as there are no stars that shine this brightly in this part of the Northern sky and it wasn&#39;t Jupiter or Venus which are at roughly in the West to NorthWestern part of the sky.  It was at about 45 to 50 degrees in elevation in relation to the horizon, and pretty far away.  It&#39;s hard to say how far, as it was dark, but if I had to guess I would say it was at least 4 or 5 miles away.  It was about as bright, or maybe slightly brighter, as Jupiter when it&#39;s high up in the sky at night, and gain it was flickering/pulsing in many brilliant colors (Red, Blue, Green, White, etc).<n> <n><n> <n><n> I stood there at the window watching this strange &#34;star&#34; for a few seconds when all of a sudden it started moving to the right (towards the East) very quickly and stopped... and then went back towards the West and stopped.  As soon as I saw this I gasped loudly which startled my wife who was in a sound sleep and woke her up.  It&#39;s movement reminded me of a spinning top... in how it spins in place but all of a sudden will change directions... it&#39;s an abrupt but fluid movement.  At first I told myself may it was my imagination and it was like an optical illusion where I thought I was motionless while watching this &#34;star&#34; but my own slight movements made me think I was seeing movement... but then all of a sudden it went straight up a bit, like it gained altitude and quickly went back down.  At this point I was kind of freaked out!  So I asked my wife to come and look at this and tell me if I was just me imagining things... She came to the window and it was motionless for a few ! seconds agin and as she watched it, BOOM! It started to move quickly from East to West and then back from West to East again!  She gasped as well as she didn&#39;t expect it to move like this.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I continued to watch this object as it seems be slowly flying away from us towards the North as it continues to make the abrupt but fluid (I know this is a strange way to describe, but it&#39;s the only way I can explain it) movements.  It was definitely NOT and airplane or a helicopter, or any sort of conventional aircraft... I am very familiar with aircraft and this object did not have standard navigational lighting like an aircraft would have.  And the abrupt/fluid movements it made cannot possibly be made by a conventional aircraft as we know it.  After watching it for about 5 minutes it got further away and lost it over the roofs of the houses behind my house and couldn&#39;t see it any longer.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I do not know what this object was, but I can tell you with certainty (due to my many years of experience with the night sky/amateur astronomy and my knowledge of aircraft) that this was something extraordinary.  It wasn&#39;t a planet or star, it wasn&#39;t a satellite, and most definitely was not a conventional aircraft.  I have no idea what it could have been.  I would really be interested to find out if you received any other reports from New Jersey that corroborate my sighting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thanks!<n>

No strobes just solid lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At approximately 12:15-12:20am I witnessed 3 white lights in a tight triangle formation pointing down. Below the lights there was a smaller solid green light.  There was a slight gap between the white lights and the green.  This was on NC HWY 54 westbound just after exiting from I-40 on the Durham-Chapel Hill line.  The object descended very smoothly without any lateral movement from an approximate altitude of 1000 ft. or so (rough estimation). I lost sight of it once it became obstructed by trees.  As it did so it became one solid white light.  The sighting lasted just under a minute.  The object appeared to be about a mile to my southeast.  At the time of the sighting there was a conventional smaller airplane several thousand feet up to the west-southwest of the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am a meteorologist and storm spotter so I am quite familiar with sky observation and explainable phenomena.

I don&#39;t recall if the date was March 22nd or March 23rd. They were all in a vertical line, though the line was not straight at all.  They were all flying in the same direction and then simply disappeared.  Moments later, a group of about 4 red lights flew by in the same location and direction as the others and again disappeared.  Following these lights, were a group of 3 or 4 more lights and then a single final red light.  All were going in the same direction and all seemingly disappeared into thin air.  My sister who was with me saw them as well, but dismissed them as airplanes.  Have you ever seen 6 RED airplanes all flying vertically at the same time and then several other planes following them all travelling in the same direction?

The sky is very big here, many stars, very little light pollution.  I noticed an object coming from approximately the southeast traveling west/northwest.  It was orange in color, at first I thought that it was probably a plane, but then I noticed that there was no sound at all, completely silent- it’s very quiet here too! When I studied it further, it looked like the flames in one of those fake fireplaces. My daughter and I watched it for a minute more, I looked down at the ground and when I looked back up it was gone. Completely gone, I saw absolutely no aircraft of any kind anywhere in the visible sky. I had her looking too- she’s seven and has great vision, but she couldn’t find it either. Unfortunately did not have my phone along to take a picture or video!<n>

While I first thought it was a star, eventually it went away and then near the same location where a stationary line appeared that emitted a bright yellow light.  Eventually it got dark.  Could have been a star but the 4 jets in the sky at the same time seems suspicious to me.<n>

I woke my neighbor up to see the last bit of the second fireball, and it wasn&#39;t long until we saw a third once again coming from the south-east. It took a few minutes to pass, and then faded out.  All three UFO&#39;s seemed to change speed, but were moving very slowly.  They were all orange in appearance and seemed to flicker.  They made no sound and had no tail whatsoever.<n>

My vehicle was driving approximately past mile marker 162, at around 9:32pm when I first caught glimpse of the UFO, just above the tree line.  There were no clouds in the sky so it was instantly noticeable. It was a very large, very bright, white light, roughly three to four times the size of the surrounding stars in the sky. It did not appear to be moving. It was not blinking and was far, far too large and bright to be an airplane or helicopter.  Airplanes fly over this stretch of highway all the time, I see them every night, but I&#39;ve never seen anything like this bright light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There were also four other vehicles in front of me, that I could see, who applied their brakes and slowed down, I assumed to get a better look at the light, the same way I did.  The light stayed stationary for roughly 30 seconds before it suddenly dimmed drastically and decreased in size, to a size and dimness that would have made it indistinguishable from the surrounding stars if I hadn&#39;t already been watching it.  Another ten seconds or so passed when the light suddenly went out, as if turned off by a light switch.  I tried to continue to search the sky for it, in case it reappeared, however it did not.  Once I reached my home and parked my car, I searched the sky once more but saw nothing.<n>

My girlfriend and I were staying at the Flamingo about to watch George Wallace&#39;s 10 pm show.  We were right outside the Flamingo facing the strip as she pointed to the sky and asked me what the objects were to the North. I immediately pulled out my camera and what I captured were bright white lights or orbs that would sometimes flash different colors as they hovered in the sky.  These lights spawned from each other creating new lights.  The orbs had the ability to move up and down, left and right all while hovering in the exact same area.  The way in which these objects moved defy the laws of physics.  The orbs seemed to interact with one another intelligently as they formed various and completely random shapes in the sky.  The way these objects behaved was almost as if they were showing off and wanted to be seen.  Sometimes there would be 4 or 5, and other times there were easily 20 or more.  Some of the orbs would dart away from! the group at very high speeds.  Other orbs just seemed to join the group and appear out of no where. At times one or two orbs would hover alone above the group.  A minimum of 2 airplanes flew by these orbs as I captured them on video.  My girlfriend and I , as well as one other couple seemed to be the only people paying attention to this event.  After filming for about 10 minutes we proceeded to watch George Wallace&#39;s 10 pm show.  After the show which lasted about an hour and a half I went back outside to find the objects were gone.  They never returned.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My background: I am a musician and graphic designer, 29 years of age.<n>

To my amazement, (as I actually said &#34;whoa&#34; out loud), two glowing red-orange orbs of light shot across the sky.  Our place is facing South, so, these objects flew in from the Southwest due North.<n> <n><n> <n><n> These two objects flew in a perfectly horizontal path.  They flew in a staggered formation with one appearing to be above the other, but slightly in front.  These objects left no trail like a meteor would.  The light was a constant self emitted warm orange glow with sharp edges.  The objects raced across the sky with incredible speed.  It took probably no more than 3 seconds to cover the extent of my view in the horizon before they flew behind our home and out of site.  These were no meteors.  They appeared to be intelligently controlled.  The best way to describe the size of the objects in the sky would be to say if you held a lit cigarette as far from your face as possible in the dark against the sky, that little orange glow is about the size of the two objects seen racing across the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am a licensed professional business owner in the state of Indiana.

Two of my dogs were sitting together looking skyward so I turned my gaze in the direction they were looking.  As I turned I observed a brilliant tree leaf green strobe of light emitting from an object of in-determinant size and shape because of the intensity of the light.  The light did not appear as search light type of projection but more as a neon sign, contained into a shape similar to the blade of a Roman sword.  The light did not appear to look as an after-burner/reheat exhaust flame would look.  I had 10 years active duty USAF with 4-5 years of them engaged in flight operations of after-burning aircraft a couple of which included arming aircraft in the hammer-heads or taxiways prior to launch; thereby enabling observation of A-B operation at distances as close as 50 feet.  The green light suddenly changed to a yellow/orange color while! maintaining what appeared to be the same structure and size that the green light had.   At the base of the lights, where a darker object appeared to be located, there were smaller spears of light with a shape similar to the larger spear/sword sort of as the leaves at the base of a flower.  As suddenly as the light had changed from green to yellow/orange the yellow light went out and I thought I heard a faint humming sound.  I strained to see any solid object where the lights had been but saw nothing against the dark and overcast sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As it was an overcast evening with a fairly solid cloud layer at what I would estimate at perhaps 2-3000 feet and the lights were about 20-30 degrees above the horizon and appeared to be well below the cloud layer I would estimate the hypotenuse distance from where I stood to have been 2-3000 feet.  After the light extinguished I remained on the front deck listening and peering into the darkness for 4-5 minutes.  I heard a low hum similar to what a small reciprocating engine aircraft might sound at a considerable distance.  It is possible that a light aircraft was passing over above the cloud layer that I could not see and I simply assumed the sound I was hearing was coming from the object.  Had it not been for the brilliant light spear/sword I might have chalked the incident up to a light aircraft observation.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of sighting is approximate.

He also said it left a mist/vapor-like outline behind of the craft&#39;s form.<n> <n><n> <n><n> He also stated that approximately 2-3 minutes later there were two fighter jets seen cir! cling that area.

My eyes kept falling on one light that appeared to not be moving, but it disappeared behind trees because we were moving through winding roads.  Once me and one friend arrived at my house we decided to check it out from the back deck.  We looked in the same area as on the drive and there was this extremely low, but further away light. It looked like it was kind of lightly flashing white maybe a little blue/red like an airplane would.  But it wasn&#39;t moving, just sitting in the sky in the same spot. Suddenly it grew brighter orange extremely fast, scaring my friend and me. Then as quickly as it grew bright it faded out and disappeared. My friend has never believed in things like UFO&#39;s or had a curiosity for the unknown.  She was absolutely shaken, in tears. You could tell she knew something wasn&#39;t right. A few days earlier my mother saw the same light around the same spot and just kept saying &#34;that wasn&#39;t a plane, that was weird&#34;.  I could tell she felt something was off.

I heard the sounds of a large running machine also with the sound of air being vented.  Similar to the sounds of a large jet plane, my instinct was that it was a plane.  But when I noticed the sound was as if it was closer to the ground then most aircraft and the sound of the engine wasnt going away as if the craft was flying away.  So I had noticed this was around for too long I decided to look out the window.  To my amazement this craft was not a plane, it was hovering north-east, it had 4 flashing blue lights flickering in a circle motion with a center white light.  It wasn&#39;t flying fast enough to be a jet plane. I went down stairs to get my camera which would have provided a good picture, but the battery was dead.  I really wanted to tell someone, if i could call a number that isnt long distance I would.  The craft slowly traveled north-east and the blue lights disappeared but the white ligh! t remained.  Then 4 white lights flashed very bright all of a sudden in a different timing synced with the other lights flashing.  Once it was out of sight I looked at the sky, I looked at all the stars or what seemed like stars.  I noticed 2 distant lights that looked like stars, they were getting closer to each other into 1 light, then seperated and it was as if 2 stars were there.  They kept getting closer and coming apart for a few minutes then disappeared.<n>

They where all at various altitudes ranging from very low to horizon (from my vantage point) to very high altitude. they were glowing red to orange and each one was a different intensity and colour. I noticed them as they were manoeuvring around quite vigorously in the sky. I immediately ran indoors to call my housemate to come look at what was in the sky. We both then went out and witnessed each of the craft move slowly up into the sky and at high altitude seemed to disappear. By 11:00pm the last of the objects faded out and we then thought they were gone. I tried to get picture and video on my cellphone but the camera could barely make them out. I then noticed my housemate had a much better cammera with a really big lens on it. He said he got a few snaps of them. Then suddenly I noticed one of the craft coming direc! tly over our heads at height of about a 1000 meters. It was glowing white but in a very faint fashion. It was clearly a disc-shaped craft and moving as fast as a helicopter would but in COMPLETE SILENCE. As it passed over it appeared to have a smaller glowing orb (spherical shaped) craft come out of the centre of the disc and drop down and move away in a westerly direction. The main (or bigger) craft continued at the same height in an south westerly direction. Again we managed to get some pictures before the object disappeared behind the trees. The formation of the craft where originally to the north of our position (Northcliff looking north towards Midrand area). The disc with the smaller orb like craft where heading in the direction of soweto, the smaller craft after detaching and moving in the same direction then veered westward toward Roodepoort. Entire sighting lasted roughly 20 minutes. There was no wind, conditions where clear and mild with no clouds. Venus was clear! ly visible directly north west of where we first saw the forma! tion of craft and its a new moon here tonight so that rules out astronomical objects entirely.<n>

I had a sense for a few days that something was different in the atmosphere.  The day before I had told my Mom that I sensed an &#34;eery stillness / quietness on the roads &amp; outside in the sun, etc.&#34;   So anyway, a couple of nights later when it was hot &amp; humid I went out into the backyard and looked up at the sky.  It was around 9:00 pm.  I saw many stars, but there appeared to be something that was changing colors.  And this one object (or whatever it was) was not &#34;flying&#34; across the sky like all the other aircraft going back &amp; forth to Logan Airport.  It was kind of hovering there in the sky in the South-Westerly direction towards or over Shrewsbury or Worcester.  It seemed far away, but I could see it . . and it was different.  This object appeared t! o emit a beam or beams of colored light ONCE IN A WHILE from the sides and/or the top and bottom.  I called my Mom to come and take a look at it, and tell me what she saw,i.e. what she thought.  We couldn&#39;t believe what we saw.  But keep in mind at this time (9 pm - 10 pm) it was far away.  As the night went on and all the other bodies in the nightsky moved in tandem with the earth (as the moon does) so did this &#34;object&#34;   - - -  and it became clearer (or CLOSER!) to see around 10:30 pm onward!  Around 23:00 hours (11:00 pm) we COULD REALLY SEE that this was NOT a planet, and we could both agree that we saw pulsating light changes of RED-BLUE-GREEN!  Fascinating. . . didn&#39;t want to go to bed . . but we did.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On the following night, which is now - Wednesday evening March 21, 2012 - I had a feeling it may be there again.  And it was!  I just had to see it, but this time I went and got some high powered binoculars - anything I could use to get a closer look!  And on this evening it had the same pattern of movement, but I noticed a perfect triangular shape with 3 lights on each corner hovering underneath this &#34;object&#34;.  The triangle seemed massive and quiet and black.  Mom and I really felt that this original object from the night before was a UFO, because with the binoculars on this night when it seemed closer to the earth around 23:00 hours (11 pm), we both saw square windows around the perimeter of a disc!!  And now we could see that this is where the colored lights were pulsating from.  You could clearly make out a disc shape and an aliveness to the vehicle/craft.  At this time of night the object/craft/whatever was more in a Westerly direction from our backyard.  Kind of amazin! g stuff . .  and wondering what they are doing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Oh and by the way, a couple of nights ago when our temperatures got very warm, before I witnessed this anomaly, I had my bedroom windows open all night.  The next morning I woke up and told my Mom that I had trouble sleeping because I heard strange grinding machine-like noises in the sky ALL night . .  into the early am hours.  There were no cars passing by and it was otherwise quiet outside our rural suburban neighborhood.  But that noise was there - all night.  It was annoying and I didn&#39;t know what it was.  Just FYI.  Interesting . . and Strange.<n>

When I turned around there was a super bright light over west side of my property. Bright pulsing light that hurt the eyes to look at. After about 45 seconds it moved to left abruptly  then up, then back and started to pulse ( in a rhythm like a heart beat) . I ran in house got camera and my wife to see! Then it got brighter and another one appeared to it&#39;s right much smaller and pulsed as well. The bigger one darted to the left, stopped on a dime and vanished. the little one stayed there until 10:30 pm at which time it vanished.  The dog would not go outside! I took pictures with my  digital camera and used my cell phone to capture what I could on video. The whole thing exhausted me and my wife so we sat down on the sofa at 10:30 and woke up at 1:30 a.m. on the couch and went to ! bed. I had really strange dreams as well all night and a weird smell like wet limestone or concrete and a bad taste in my mouth like a bitter burning taste sensation. I wasn&#39;t going to report it because it was so damn weird but I can&#39;t explain any off it. It was a very bizarre night and was wondering if anyone else saw anything. I asked my neighbor who was raking leaves this morning and she didn&#39;t see anything ! The pictures are strange as well. It, they,  look like a gold sort of clam shell shaped thing in some pictures and like a oval welding light with a green blue halo and then like a white glow. It was an extremely clear warm night. Even saw a shooting star when we were watching these things. I should note that shortly after these things left a very low flying helicopter flew directly at it&#39;s location from east to west right over our home. I don&#39;t know if it was related but thought it should be mentioned.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I imagine this was due to the distance traveled.  As the first object was reaching the more southern half of the sky, the next one appeared.  I thought I may have seen what appeared to be lightening but I can&#39;t be certain and there are no current storms in the area.<n>

At about 7:50pm I was looking at the horizon when I noticed a faint orange flicker, I’ve seen this a few times in the past year or so.  The fireball was coming from the south southeast and was headed west northwest at a fairly slow rate of speed.  As it drew closer it was steadily getting brighter until it looked like a flaming meteor without a tail.  It continued along this path for about thirty to forty five seconds then it slowly faded out and in until it disappeared.  It didn’t fly so far away that I lost sight of it, it just faded out.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About seven minutes later I noticed a very bright stationary object low on the eastern horizon that I thought was Venus. About thirty seconds after that I saw that, another fireball coming from and headed in the same direction as the other fireball. This one flew directly over me so I got a better look at it than the other. When it got directly overhead of me I could tell that it was an orange orb with an orange haze around it, it wasn’t a plane light or anything of the sort. It was of constant brightness, color and definition while above me, it also emitted these cone projections of translucent orange light at random spots around it and, similar to what a pulsar star would look like only it wasn’t spinning. This may explain the flickering it gives off at a distance that makes it look like a candle flame and both were completely silent.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After the second orb/fireball faded away like the other I continued my walk. Looking east again I noticed “Venus” was gone.  Then about a minute later it reappeared lower on the horizon and stationary. It was a brilliant white light that glimmered like a flawless diamond would under intense light. I watched it for a few minutes and noticed it started moving out from over the house I used as a point of reference north towards some trees.  It continued along this path until it faded out like the fireballs did.  Also i should add that i saw a police helicopter going east a minute or so before the first fireball appeared.  All in all the whole three experiences lasted a total of about thirty to forty minutes.<n>

I deliver our local read and see late arrival aircraft on occasion.  This was not one.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Only other thought is that we are not far from Niagara Falls Air Base and maybe this was a fight jet.  I have heard fighter jets in the past and this did not sound like one.  Also time of departure would have been an issue.<n>

My 16-year-old son looked out the window to watch the storm come in.  We live on the 3rd floor over a ravine in Northwest Austin.  He said he looked down and saw a red light that he thought could be a golf cart.  This is a heavily wooded area that is hard to walk in.  You couldn’t take a golf cart through there, let alone do it during a rain storm.  I, who have never actually seen a UFO, congratulated him on his first UFO sighting.  I was just joking but then I said &#34;sounds like you saw an orb.&#34;  He paused for about a minute and said, &#34;Now that you mention it, that’s exactly what it looked like.&#34;<n> <n><n> <n><n> I just played Peter Davenport from C2C just today at work (Th 3/22) so it may have been the red fireball he was talking about.   I am really into UFOs and have never seen one myself, and he had no idea of my interest in them before Tuesday.<n>

I have been trying to get one on film for close to 13 yrs.  On March 19th I was watching t.v. when a red light over the ocean caught my eye.  I watched it out my window for around a minute before getting my video camera hoping to get a closer look and document the event.  As I watched the object it got brighter and dimmer, giving off streaks of light in different colors.  I climbed out my bathroom window onto the roof to get a unobstructed view of the object. The air was freezing  and I didn&#39;t grab a jacket so it was hard to hold the camera still and I was standing on the pitch of the roof.  I filmed the object for close to three minutes.  The object seemed to be a orb of energy.  The round light would get really small, then grow large.  As the object got smaller the light got brighter, as it got bigger the object almost dissipated then would reform.  This object has appeared over the ocea! n several times over the last month.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Years ago (around 1999) as many as 20 people were standing on the street all looking at an object that defied physics.  We made reports to the local news and they ran the story saying it was a weather balloon. Anyone that saw that object knows it was not a weather balloon.  Please tell me the best way to document these events as to leave no skeptics, I feel the central coast of California is a UFO hot spot and needs to be investigated by serious professionals.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have 3 minutes of what I feel is very good UFO footage.  I would love to have a professional in the field view my footage and give an explanation for what I have on film.<n>

Almost looks like a very bright star or planet but makes erratic flight patterns.  It&#39;s always almost in the same spot in the sky, and it changes colors from blue to red to green to yellow etc. It moves short distances very fast and in awkward patterns.  The first time we&#39;ve seen it it was changing shapes.  She was never into this sort of thing but I had my first sighting living in Canada four years ago and have been intrigued ever since.  There was no way it was a plane, helicopter, or flares but could be some logical scientific explanation, any advice is appreciated.<n>

I sat and watched them for about 5 minutes then knocked on my roommates window to get his attention, he did not hear me so I proceeded to watch for a few more minutes.  I then went back into my house . about a half an hour later I went back out to smoke a cigarette and looked up in the sky and there was only 1 bright light with a crown glowing gleam on it .  I then  went and got my girlfriend and my roommate and told them to come outside to check it out . all 3 of us went outside and were looking at this weird that was in the sky . my roommate thought it was a planet movie that was just glowing. the light was moving very slow .  all 3 of us were confused .  I am still confused of where abouts the ! second light went .<n>

(We were on Main Street, slightly south of Northrup St., for what that&#39;s worth.)  It appeared to be a single rapidly and irregularly flickering light source.  There was conventional air traffic visible in the same general region of the sky at that time, and the difference between this light source and the planes was pretty obvious: those had regular blinking and distinct lights, even at a great distance, while this thing did not.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It did not keep a perfectly straight course as near as I could tell--there appeared to be some &#34;wobbling,&#34; although not all of us agreed on that.  (At least one of us thought it was an illusion caused by the light flickering.)  My first thought was that it was a large flying paper lantern, but it was much too bright, much too high up, and after a minute it was clear that it was ascending too quickly for that.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was very clearly visible in the middle of a heavily light-polluted metropolitan area, so it wasn&#39;t a faint light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It appeared to be ascending very rapidly, much faster than I have ever personally seen a conventional aircraft rise.  Closest thing I could compare it to from my own experience is a space shuttle launch I saw about ten years ago, but this left no exhaust trail.  After about two minutes, it began to dim and disappeared completely over a ten second period.<n>

The object appeared as a star, but brighter than any normal star in the sky.  Something about the object continuously grabbed my attention and made me pay more attention to it than I would a normal star or planet.  I am certain it was not Jupiter or Venus, due to the fact that both of these planets were visible in the western sky and the object in question was much more northerly in direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I observed the light in the sky for close to forty-five minutes from Kokomo, Indiana north along US-31 to the Indiana State route 10 at the town of Argos, Indiana.   As I passed the Argos junction, I noticed the light began moving in a clockwise rotation in front of me.  This lasted almost three seconds for the entire rotation.  The object then proceeded in a north western direction towards Plymouth, IN.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am a truck driver and drive this route five days a week.  I have never noticed anything unusual or strange in the sky and I am very familiar with the stars and planets in the sky at night along this stretch of highway.  The light stayed stationary for close to an hour before moving, but I was drawn to keep looking at it.  There was something different about it, but I am still not sure what it was besides the movement at the end of the event.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was very shaken by the experience and really need to get some grasp on what I have seen.  I have never seen anything stay stationary for so long and rocket off with such speed.  I truly have no idea what I observed, but I know it was no plane or planet.<n>

We stopped at a stop sign and saw a light in the sky. The light was flashing oddly, but not really flashing.  It was definitely pulsing yellow blue and white.  The light faded bright and then dim, faded bright and dim. It was in a kind of straight line, but it looked like it curved around the edges.  This craft was simply hovering above the sky, just pulsing lights.  All of a sudden we see the craft tilt to about a 45-degree angle.  The craft then starts moving in a straight line. We started to follow it, and had a rather easy time doing it.  All of a sudden, the craft disappeared behind some clouds.  When it came back in to view, it was far on the horizon.  It travelled miles literally in seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I also feel the need to include the fact that I am a veteran of the military. I used to work in the Aviation department. I have never seen the military possess anything that could hover and move that fast. Not even a helicopter. Unfortunatel! y, since we were in the car, we have no real photographic evidence, and didn&#39;t see enough of a shape to really provide any detailed drawing.<n>

On the bottom of the object, a red/orange solid light.  It did not flicker like a flame, remaining the same throughout the sighting.   Although moving at a rapid pace, there was no noise produced.  It appeared to be too low for a plane, but too high for a remotely driven object.  It did not spin, remaining level and proceeding rapidly.  We watched until it disappeared behind the trees.  I did not get a picture, for my phone has too low resolution and capability for smaller object that high up.  It did not hesitate or leave a trail. There were trails of jets flying at a much higher altitude above it.<n>

There was very odd lightning to the NorthEast of my location, just south of Charleston, WV.  I have seen strange things in the sky before, and I know what meteorites look like, I know what satellites look like, stars, planets, etc.  The closest thing I xan compare ot to was that it looked about the same relative brightness as Venus has looked lately. Venus has been quite bright and this objects was as well.  It seemed to just appear, and looked to be going SW to NE, although it was at least as far away as an airliner flying around 25-30&#39; ft. _t was moving faster than a Jet though anwas headed straight toward the small spot in the sky that had the strange lightning.  It never changed direction much but once it got into the cloud with the lightning it seemed to vanish without a trace.  Very shortly thereafter, the lightning stopped as well.  It was all very strange and had me very intrigued.  This is my first post ! here because it is the first time I have seen something I felt truly significant enough to post. I believe there was a correlation between the object and the lightning.<n>

It is possible that someone has not come forward, or gone public with any possible evidence of a sighting, but so far no sighting has been made.  From March 19th 2012, to March 22nd 2012, at approximately 5 am each morning, the Clintonville dispatch has reported over twenty phone calls from local Clintonville residents, complaining about loud noise, similar to fireworks, thunder, and rattling noise.  It has occurred for 3 night’s straight now, and researchers have declared it to be a 1.5 earthquake.  Others, like me, question this theory, and are searching for a more accurate answer, with solid evidence.  I am requesting your knowledge and experience in UFO sightings, and phenomenon.  I would like someone to question the local residents who heard the noises, and I wonder if maybe someone has seen something abnormal.  Maybe the police are not asking the right questions, or to avoid panic throughout the to! wn, not disclosing evidence of a sighting, and quieting the town with an explanation of an earthquake.  Please look into the report’s on this Clintonville earthquake, and do your own research.  Maybe it is worth your time.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I got home at approximately 1930 hours and decided to take my Boxer dog Raja for a walk.  We walk a big loop of about 1.25 miles.  Toward the end of our walk in Niceville Florida we were coming down the hill on 27th street just past the Mormon Church.  We were coming from the east and facing west.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About one hundred yards before reaching the corner of 27th Street and South Cedar Street I suddenly saw a large ball of fire rise from the tree line.  I continued walking toward it assuming it was a small airplane from the aero club on Eglin AFB.  However, I began to notice it was just hovering there silently—perhaps about one thousand feet or so above the tree line.  It was amber in color and just a big ball of pulsating light. It didn’t blink in or out—but pulsed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have worked on aircraft for 31 years for the federal government.  I also hold an FAA A&amp;P mechanic’s license. I have seen many things in 31 years on flight lines all around the world. But I never saw anything like this.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What struck me was that this thing rose suddenly out of the tree line and hovered for a minute. It was completely silent. It had no standard aircraft lighting, no wing tip lights, no anti-collision or beacon light, nothing but its pulsating amber color.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After hovering for a minute it turned toward the north east and moved slightly faster than a small propeller aircraft, but much faster than a blimp could go. I believe it was between one or two thousand feet in altitude. As it moved north east it began to shrink down to about half its original size. I lost sight of it behind a large oak tree hanging over South Cedar Street a couple hundred yards to my right. I walked briskly in that direction but by the time I got there it had disappeared from the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It flew at about a 45 degree angle when it cut across south cedar heading north east. I know it went past the high school on John Sims Boulevard (Highway 20) before it disappeared. As bright as it was it seemed as if it held all its light internally. There was no light reflection on the pavement—even though at 22:00 hours it was completely dark outside.<n> <n><n> <n><n> An elderly lady was sitting in a lawn chair on her porch at the corner of South Cedar and 27th Street. When I saw her I asked, “What is that?” She said I don’t know but it rose up from the tree line. I told her it’s not an aircraft because it’s completely silent. She said “maybe the base is experimenting with something.”  I said I don’t think so. I work out there and have never seen anything like that.” She then said, “Well two of us saw it.” That’s when I went north on South Cedar Street chasing after the silent light. When I came back the elderly women had gone inside. The object initially appeared about one third the size of a full moon. It hovered for about one minute and was visible for maybe one more minute after it shrunk to about half its original size and headed north east.<n>

The objects were about 10,000 feet above the ground. Each object had 3 bright lights horizontally without a beam. There was a reflection and refracted light like a rainbow around the 3 lights on both objects. We watched with binoculars and eventually the objects moved slowly northward and disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> DETAILED SUMMARY OF SIGHTING On Sunday evening, March 18, 2012 at about 10PM I was on my patio and noticed an unusually bright light in the northern sky and a light of lesser brightness further north in the northern sky. I looked at both for a while, maybe 5 or 10 minutes, and noticed that they were not moving at all. I observed this from Estero, FL and determined that the two lights were approximately over the city of Ft Myers, FL or perhaps a bit further north than that. The sky was clear with no cloud cover. I called my wife to come and see the two lights and she also noticed that they did not move in any direction. During this time, several airplanes heading to the SW Florida International Airport passed under thee two lights so you could tell that these lights were not aircraft of any kind known to either of us. After about 20 minutes of watching the two lights/objects I got my powerful binoculars and took a closer look. Upon closer observation I noticed that there were actually three bright lights! side by side in a horizontal configuration without any light beam. Surrounding the three bright lights was an aura or reflection with refracted light, like a rainbow, but I could not see what shape the object that supported the three lights might have been. The other object of lesser brightness turned out to be the same, having three lights side by side in a horizontal configuration with the rainbow-like aura, only dimmer because it appeared further north and was more distant visually. So there were two similar objects in the northern night sky separated from each other by many miles, not moving in any direction and making no sound at all. By all appearances the two lights were about 10,000 feet above the ground or perhaps a bit more. I also determined that the size of each object was about 75 - 100 feet in length or diameter and was about half the size of my small fingernail if I extended my arm fully. We continued to watch with the binoculars for another 15 or 20 minutes! with no changes that were obvious to us. Then gradually the t! wo objec ts moved slowly north and eventually disappeared from view. That was it. There was no more to the sighting. The time was then about 10:45 or 10:50PM.<n> <n><n> <n><n> APPEARANCE OF THE OBJECTS I could not see the shape of the objects because of the darkness in the sky but they were probably oblong, like a cigar, or saucer-shaped with us having seen the side view of the saucer. The configuration of the three lights brought me to this conclusion about the shape of the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> SIZE OF THE OBJECTS They appeared to be about 75 - 100 feet in length or diameter for actual size and about the size of half of my small fingernail with my arm fully extended for relative size.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ESTIMATED DISTANCE OR ALTITUDE The closer object was about 10,000 feet above the ground or more and seemed to be about 15 miles from my point of observation. The dimmer object seemed to be about 20 miles or so away at about the same estimated altitude of 10,000 feet or more.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I sensed something moving in the air towards the front left dark night sky.  I glanced up (due south) and immediately saw a reddish-orange circular orb like object, with a lesser intense aura encompassing the object, traveling in a straight line across the sky from south to north. It was similar to mars in color, however, was much larger (about 4x) to the naked eye.  It traveled overhead at an incredible speed, much faster than a jet. I could see actual commercial jets flying around in the sky, and it was nothing like them. It was not any satellite I know of.  There were no observable blinking lights, and no shape, other than what I can only describe as an “orb”. It moved very smoothly.  I was able to video it on my iPhone for 58 seconds before it was completely out of the line of sight.  It had absolutely no sound at all.  It remained the same color and brightness, and almost the exact same size during the entire time I witnessed this object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am an amateur astronomer, and have never seen anything like this, ever!<n>

There was a triangle with three bright yellow lights with flashing white lights between them.   live near washington dc which has many large airports and military bases near it so I was skeptical.  However this craft moved completely silently and appeared to be not that high up in the night sky.  I did see other recognizable planes in the sky that were making noise and did not look like this craft.  It was moving very quickly and I jogged to keep up with its position as it moved behind the houses on my street.  I eventually saw it a second time in a new location close to where I originally noticed it.<n>

We were just a few miles from Iowa City on I80 when we both saw this at the same time.  My wife was driving; I was in the passenger seat.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was as small as a star, but more orange in color.  Like as if an orange star was closer, like within the atmosphere, but it was fast, very very fast.  It zipped in a almost straight line from the southern sky to the north.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The whole thing lasted only about 4 - 5 seconds.  Immediately my wife and I exclaimed to one another....&amp;quot;did you see that&amp;quot;?  But it was gone very quickly.  It left a very strong impression on both of us.  We both have seen shooting stars and meteor showers...but this was noticiable different.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Orange, small and very very fast.

I looked across the street and noticed a bright, almost fiery looking red light slowly rising into the sky. I couldn&#39;t figure out what it was, so I ran inside to bring my sister outside to see if she could see it and/or knew what it was.  When we got back outside, it was gone.  As we searched for it, we noticed the sky was unusually clear for our area, and the stars were unusually bright. When we faced the opposite direction, we saw the light again above our neighbors house, moving in an erratic manner and darting all over.  Then, it was gone. We then noticed another, in a different part of the sky, which my sister recorded on her phone. It was moving similarly.  We then began to notice a number of airplanes in the sky, all about the same distance away from us, all in different parts of the sky.  All flying as if they were flying the perimeter of the earth; that&#39;s the best way to describe it. We counted 9 airplane! s.  That amount of airplanes, all at once, is EXTREMELY unusual in our area particularly.  We also looked up to see a very, very large plane fly overhead that was so large and so close, the shape could be made out perfectly.  It was loud and had bright circular lights lining the bottom of it in a V-formation; something I&#39;ve never seen on an airplane before.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

My daughter and I saw a red/orange ball in sky. Moving from south to north in seattle.  The object at first looked like it was something on fire, a balloon or plane, but there were no other lights, No flashing, object made no noise. It took about 2 minutes to fly accross the sky.  It was at one point close to being directly underneath us.  Never seen anything like it. If it was a meteor it would have been announce by Nasa as a near miss to earth.  This was not a meteor. I don&#39;t know what it was.  There was also a quick flash of light across the sky at one point. I do not know if this was connected to the object.  It may have been lightning, then 10 seconds later rumbling/boom like sonic boom or thunder, but the sky was partially clear.<n>

It lasted only a couple seconds but left be blinded for two minutes.  I know this due to the fact that I had just glanced at the clock in the dash of the car just before the flash.  I slowed my car down, I did not pull off the road as there is a huge ditch and I could see well enough to stay on the road.  When I could see throgh the spots I was seeing the clock now read 8:42. I thought I might be having a stroke as my whole body felt very odd and drained.  When I arrived home my son and wife were standing outside, I asked if they had seen the flash, my son said the sky lit up like daytime for a second, but no sound or explosion was heard.  They thought a transformer must have blown. I related my story to them.  It took well over an hour for my sight to return to almost normal.  Today my eyes are stinging some and they dont focus as fast as normal.  I can not find anythi! ng online about anyone else seeing this last night.<n>

There must have been a low mist because only the main bright stars could be seen.  On the lower horizon there were none.  I looked up and could easily make out the constellation of Orion.  Several planes, as always could be seen flashing their lights and coming in to land at London Stanstead Airport, mostly heading east.  Some could also be seen climbing on departure in the distance as single flashing lights obscured by the slight ground mist that obviously obscured all distant horizon vision.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was day dreaming and looking at Orion relaxing my eyes from the computer in the dark wondering about its connection with the pyramids when I saw a large flame-red slow pulsing disc coming out of Orion the Hunter. When I say coming out, I mean that I first noticed it as it passed my view of Orion which was partially obscured and edged by my window frame.  For a second or two I thought I was imagining it.  The whole of the disc glowed flame red.  It was not a light as seen on a plane but a whole object that pulsed red from within.  Maybe it would be better to say that it throbbed with intensity from bright to very bright every two seconds.  It had clear definable edges. Although in the middle there seemed to be a horizontal thin bright white line at times.  It was heading east. About the same speed as the occasional incoming planes were in the near distance.  I shouted out at the top of my voice to my colleague who was feeding the dog downstairs.  The door was shut in the upstairs o! ffice but I did not want to take my eyes of it for a second to even open the door to call downstairs.  So I shouted again seriously loud.  The dog barked and I could hear him rushing up the stairs. “Look at fxxxing that!” I said as he entered the room.  He was in time to see it moving just before it came to a sudden halt.  I tried to open the window as it was double glazed as I wanted to see it without obstruction.  It was locked, so I rushed into my bedroom and flung open my window there. John and I watched it stationary for over a full minute as it pulsed and hung in the sky just above the opposite roof top of the adjacent house. Not that it was above it per se, but maybe six or eight hundred yards away, maybe a lot more. I measured it as ¾ of an inch twixt thumb and forefinger at arm’s length. It never budged an inch from its position but was gradually fading and losing intensity of colour, eventually becoming a reddish brown. Also it was becoming smaller as if heading away a! t a perfect angle to us. It slowly shrunk and faded out of exi! stence t o a miniscule point.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We walked out of the room and as he went downstairs to draw what he saw I said hopefully, “Where are you going it might come back.”  To my great surprise it did! In the time of walking from one room to the other it was repeating its movements. I saw it in the sky away from Orion as soon as I looked out of the window and it came on in, on a slightly different route. It halted again and hung in the air virtually in the same area. But before it faded out completely it lowered out of vision beyond the neighbour’s rooftop.<n>

My wife and I were crossing the street to visit a neighbor when we saw a bright red lighted craft coming from the south to the north.  Both of us thought it was a helicopter at first because of its height but quickly realized that it was making no sound.  There were other aircraft in what I would call their normal patterns heading toward and away from Ohare Airport but this one was lower than all other aircraft and on a level flight path.  It passed nearly directly above us and was was, again, a solid red lit object...no other colors and no strobing or blinking as everyone other craft is outfitted with.   We couldn&#39;t tell what the exact shape or size was  but it was larger than a helicopter and smaller than a commercial craft.  It wasn&#39;t  traveling at an amazing rate of speed and continued north with a slight curve east toward Lake Michigan.  At the last moment I pulled out my cell phone and snapped a couple of pictures of it  because we thought it was on an intercept course with a blinking plane flying from the east but the pictures just show two light dots...of the red craft and the plane which was decidedly higher.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The red light craft continued at its constant rate and left our field of vision behind the houses and trees to our N/NE.<n>

The noise was so loud you could feel the rumble on your chest. Also hearing the noise from inside my brother runs out the door and the first words out of his mouth are &#34;is this the apocalypse&#34;.  The weirdest part of the whole thing is that it was the middle of the day and being able to see clear in all directions, there was nothing in the sky at all. This did sound alot like a jet but about a thousands times louder.  Unlike anything I have every experienced.<n>

There were no other lights on it other than the light that we watched. It moved quite fast and made no sound as it traveled in a northeast direction.  The odd thing is that this strange thing followed a straight line but was wobbling like it was caught in the wind, or something like that.<n>

I have seen planes, comets, satellites,  ext this was different enought that I got online to find out how to report what I saw.

I&#39;ve been seeing these weird lights at night lately, and I&#39;ve posted about them here before.  I would like to clarify that it is neither a planet, nor a star because I actually saw it fly in.  A green light flew down from above, and descended, moving around from side to side momentarily as if it was looking for where to stop, and then it stopped and just hovered in a location northeast of me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am on M-50, the ufo looks like it is up past North Custer road.  Looking through the binoculars on a night that is becoming progressively more foggy, it is hard to see anything other than a green circular light.  It has moved up a little bit from where it was before, but it is out there as I type this.  I probably wont stay up all night watching it but it&#39;s been out there for a little over an hour.<n>

Triangular in shape, fast, and absent of sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My girlfriend and I were enjoying a cigarette before bed after enjoying a beautiful evening outdoors.  The weather was perfect and stars were clearly visible in the nights sky.  Just as we were about to walk in to call it a night, I noticed a shooting star streak through the nights sky, and pointed it out to my girlfriend.  Almost immediately following this the neighbors began having a bit of a verbal dispute and we decided to listen to the drunken barrage coming from next door. We stayed very quiet and made sure we were not noticed.  I happened to be gazing up at the heavens and listening when the sighting occurred.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I thought a satellite very high in the atmosphere was passing over head initially, until the distorted image made itself apparent.  The size of this object was larger than any plane and well under 1000 feet in altitude.  Even during the neighbors bickering and our attempts to be quiet, I let out a yell of excitement and pointed to this massive, cloaked aircraft floating along at an incredible clip with absolutely no sound emanating from an engine.  Not even a hum. How I could be so fooled to think that initially this incredible technological marvel was a satellite thousands of feet in the air is incredible.  Once it became clear to me that this was an immensely sized UFO cloaking itself with the nights sky I was Damn near hysterical.  My girlfriend was unable to spot it, even following my fingers direction.  I think it simply fooled her vision as it had mine initially.  Within the span of time of roughly 10 - 15 seconds it had disappeared from our line of sight due to tree lines.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object was moving directly North West towards Highway 41 and Austin Straubel airport in Green Bay.  I cannot stress enough that the size and shape of this craft were abundantly clear to me.  I had 2 drinks over the entire duration of the evening, and at the time of sighting this object, I was completely sober and coherent.  The craft was an elongated triangle with rounded edges cruising at a very high speed, low altitude, and without a sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Just typing this report is not enough for me at this point.  I need to understand what this was.  Either a highly sophisticated government project, or (no offense to our human intellect) an extra terrestrial craft, which I find to be more feasible.  Please let me know if anyone else had a sighting, or knows of anyone that may have seen this.  I will be contacting Austin Straubel tomorrow to see if their radar had caught something out of the ordinary.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Honestly, it&#39;s hard to be skeptical of anything going forward. I&#39;m 31 years old, hold an executive position, and now I feel like a naive child.<n>

We climbed up just looking at the stars for a while, our eyes adjusted.  At about 12:15 I looked out to the Northwest, and noticed a single bright light, and signaled my buddy to look at it…I had seen the same thing several months before.  A single bright, slightly off white, somewhat yellowed circular light hanging stationary above the ridge.  We pretty much stared at it for a good 10-20 minutes, and it faded to a point, then blinked out.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Ten minutes later, we noticed it had come back in the same exact position – it remained there, slightly brighter, before blinking completely out instantly, not fading, just completely going dark, several seconds later it faded back, then flashed out completely.  Another few minutes passed without any event, then one light came into existence, slightly smaller than the original, but just to the left of the position of the original light, shortly after, a light of the original intensity came back, in the same exact position it had been the entire time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then they both flickered out, then back once – they’d moved in a Northwardly direction- right of their original positions.  They blinked out again, and reappeared slightly more to the right.  The third time they reappeared, they didn’t blink off again, sliding slowly to the right, and down toward the ridge, behind a cell tower, before disappearing completely.<n> <n><n> <n><n> For reference: We’re both freshman at the University of Pittsburgh at Johnstown.  I, a Geology major, and he, in civil engineering.  We were completely sober during this even.<n>

There were no lights.  There was no audible sound.  It was flying at high altitude. It was moving at a high rate of speed from Southeast to Northwest.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The &#34;V&#34; body of the object was strictly a &#34;V&#34; shape as stars and the contrasting darkness of space behind it was observable between the legs of the &#34;V&#34;  where a known Bomber or other flying wing shaped aircraft would support a fuselage in this area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The Object surface was not clearly discernible due to altitude and light conditions, but the overall outline was immediately defined as its lighter grey appearance passed across a darker black night sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It&#39;s color was almost that of a finger of cloud work in the night sky, but due to the maintenance of it&#39;s highly geometric shape/angle during its straight line flight path from horizon to horizon, as well as the speed in which it was travelling, there is no way for it to be mistaken for a cloud formation.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The Legs of it may have been segmented but joined due to a slight bubble leading edge observed as though scalloped.  It could very well have been separate objects flying in a VERY tight formation, but overall it seemed to be a single piece.<n>

3/17/12 17:45|Goshen|IN|Triangle|20 minutes|It was about 5:45 my sister and i had just gotten out of the movies and she said (look! ) as i looked up we both saw this dark triangle|5/13/12|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/087/S87772.html|265|ndxe201203| I saw a hollow, cylinder shapped object the color of a bubble, or rainbow,  hovering and spinning above a bush.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Between noon and 2:00 p.m. on March 17, 2012, I went outside to get something from my son&#39;s car and noticed smoke that seemed to be streaming from a bush in the front yard on the East Side of the house that is directly across the street from my house.  There are two bushes in the front yard of the house.  One on the East side.  One on the West Side.  The entire yard is surrounded by a fence.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The smoke traveled four to five feet from the bush to the rear of an SUV which is about eight feet from the fence that surrounds the house and the bush.  First I thought the bush was on fire but I didn&#39;t smell smoke, so I just felt some mischevous guys were hiding behind the bush smoking, or trying to break in the house.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I walked across the street to the bush but no one was there, just smoke, with no smell, which was strange.  The bush was opened and the stems seemed old.  Because I had never seen them open like that in the fourteen years I lived here, which was also strange, I hurredly walked back to my house and stood on the steps and remained there because I was a little puzzled by all this. The smoke disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Suddenly a lot of little flies or knats like the ones that gather in the middle of air appeared over the bush that the smoke seemed to be coming out the bottom.  Then a cylinder looking thing, not of this world appeared from no where on top of the bush and started spinning at a high rate of speed.  It was the color of a rainbow, translucent, with no top, or bottom (hollow inside).  It was the size of the middle of a wooden wine barrell.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After the translucent, bubble like, bubble colored, rainbow colored cylinder hovered and spun over the bush about a minute or two, smoke started coming out of the center of the cylinder, seemingly from the middle of the bush. Strangely, the birds and pheasants eating grass seeds in the lot adjacent to the house appeared unscathed and did not fly away.  The bush did not burn, the smoke did not smell like smoke, or fire.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Next, several of the little flies appeared on top of the bush on the West side of the house.  The cylinder started to sail to the bush on the West. The knats were still flying over the bush on the East where the cylinder was at first, but half of them seemed to be gone.  When the cylinder reached the bush on the West side of the house it hovered on top, still spinning at an out of this world speed.  Smoke came out of the middle of that bush which was not smoking at first, and did not burn.  It hovered there a couple minutes (the cylinder like thing).  Next the cylinder floated up, spinning all the time, to about the height of the light post in front of the house.  Smoke then flowed from the bush on the West, through the center of the cylinder.  In an instant, the bubble thing disappeared.  Next the smoke dissipated.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My girlfriend called about this time.  I told her what I saw.  She asked if it was on my property.   I said no.  She asked if I looked down in the bushes.  I said no, and told her she should come over to look down in the bushes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I told her that I noticed several (about ten) thin, translucent lines, like spider webs, the same rainbow color of the bubble like cyliner, in front of my house.  The web like strings were in mid air and extended straight, from the West to the East in about 20 feet from the no parking sign by my house to nowhere. They were affected a little by the wind, but strangely, just floated straight across in a parallel line without falling.  The spider web things did not appear to be attached to the cylinder- bubble, but also, were not of anything I&#39;ve ever seen on Earth, or could imagine.  They were the identical color.  I probably walked through them when I went across the street but the did not break, or fall.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My girlfriend said run in the house, slam the door, and pull down the shades.  For some reason I was not scared but I did go in the house, close the door, and close the blinds. I peeked outside and saw the smoke again on the ground by the bushes but I had seen enough and do not know if anything else happened because about this time I began to feel a little leary and would not go, or look outside.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Another strange thing happened.  The next day when my girlfriend came over to see.  She asked if I ever looked in the bushes.  I told her the bushes did not go anywhere for her to go look. Even though she wasn&#39;t going to look inside the bushes, the strangest thing happened.  When we looked across the street at the bushes, the bushes had closed all the way up, and were full, like they normally are.  The way they were opened when the cylinder appeared, it would be impossible for the bushes to close back to normal in one day, or a year.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I told a couple other people and asked a couple farmers if fruit flies made these type of cylinders.    Then, I stopped becausethe people I told, and the farmers did not seem to believe I had seen something like that. However,I turned on the radio late one night.  Coast to Coast was on. The UFO man was a guest and left his number.  I called him and he said he didn&#39;t want to hear my story, I had to write it down. I didn&#39;t write it down because what I saw did not appear to be a UFO.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Today I googled UFO and read some of the sightings.  One of them was identical to what I saw.  For this reason I have written this story.  Perhaps it can help others.<n>

No additional or flashing lights were observed on the object.  It was moving at a similar rate as to a satellite in orbit.  Suspected to be space debris spinning in orbit and catching the glare from the sun.<n>

I recorded it the best I could with my iPhone. I&#39;m still unsure what this object was.  The date was March 16, 2012.  Time around 8:30 pm.  The light was pulsing from a very bright white to red, and back to white.  It was flying in a very peculiar nonsense pattern.  Back and forth, up and down.  It seemed to go from very far away to relatively close to my location.  At times the object disappeared below the horizon.  At one point it appeared to take on a blue hue instead of the white and red I was seeing.  Also at one point I could make out the faint outline of a boomerang shape when it seemed to be relatively close to me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I drove around in the direction I was filming this object after I shut my camera off.  I didn&#39;t&#39; see anything or anybody at all.  Most of the area is either wooded or an open field.  The object never showed itself again after shutting my camera off either.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Event occurred for about 15-20 minutes, 13 of which caught on camera.<n>

The first time was last yr in August. That time it looked to be spherical in shape like a large yellow light. It had no sound as it traveled over the house. It was coming from the north west traveling south-southeast.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Tonight as I went out to bring my lawn chair up to the porch, I saw a bright yellowish light coming from the east. It did not look to be very high up and glowed considerably.  There was no sound to it at all. It looked to be thinner and higher than the previous sighting but still seemed to be the same thing because this time it seemed I was seeing it from the side.  I called my son out to look and  he saw it as it traveled  north-northwest.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What is creepy about this is there is no sound at all. If it were an ultralight there should be sound- it was too large to be a glider and too brightly lit.  It was not a balloon-hot air or otherwise I don&#39;t believe.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Any ideas what it might have been?<n> <n><n> <n><n> My son saw it before these 2 times and he said it had traveled from west  going north east and then turned diraction  to go north. There are no flashing lights on it.<n>

The first ten were in a v formation and then followed by groups of 2-3 and sometimes single lights.  The last few were somewhat separated from the initial groups.  I watched  them and then they seemed to go up further in the sky and either disappear or go into the clouds that were in the western sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I saw nothing on MSN or local news and I know I did see this strange sighting.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

My buddy (who is driving, I am in the front seat) randomly notices some strange lights in the sky on the left side in relation to where the car was.  When I turned to look what I saw at first was two red blinking lights; one was higher than the other and on a slant from the other as well.  We kept driving for a minute and observing the lights.  Then we start to notice that at first the lights were moving right, and now all of a sudden they were moving left.  At first we thought we were just seeing things, but then at this point the lights were actually close enough to perfectly determine that the object was traveling LEFT RIGHT UP and DOWN.  We are still driving, and this is only about 2 minutes into the sighting (or at least when my friend first realized it)...and now another GREEN light is being omitted.  The green light was only on very briefly as the other two red lights continued to blink.  ! Now my friend and I were 100 percent convinced and immediately pulled the car over to attempt a shot at getting a better video.  Now we are about 10 minutes into the sighting.  When we observed the two blinking red lights from the sidewalk of the street it was clearly evident that the object was moving in all directions as if it was hovering or was in-decisive of where it wanted to go.  This is where my mind was completely blown...there was now a BLUE light as well, which only appeared for a short time just like the green light did earlier.  The two red lights constantly blink&#39;d and seemed to fly in sync with one another although as I mentioned earlier, one was higher and on a slant from the other.  Another note that I&#39;d like to make is that when the other colored lights such as the GREEN and BLUE appeared for their brief moment, a WHITE light was also somewhat evident but not as radiant as the colored lights.  Unfortunately our best video was actually taken in the car whil! e driving, as the lights moved further and further away.  It w! as weird When we were driving it seemed like they were so close to us, and like I said earlier, after little observation...we were like &#34;that fucking thing is hovering.  It keeps flying right, then left.&#34;  Once we decided to pull over, the lights just got further and further.  We attempted to hop back in the car and chase it for a few minutes until we realized it was a hopeless cause.  Both my friend and I felt though that when it did begin to start moving away quickly, it would make incredible travel time between the blinks of the two red lights.  My friend has the video on his phone.  I&#39;ll upload it to youtube as UFO sighting in AZ when I get a chance, or when he does.  Hope you enjoyed what we saw and my description. I have to say I&#39;ve seem some questionable lights in the sky before such as weird blinking white lights, but never anything like what we saw today.  After today, I&#39;m convinced.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

By the time the craft was over me I had stopped my car to stare in awe at this object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It looked as following; triangular solid black craft, three bright white lights at each corner on the bottom of the triangle, one red blinking light and another that blinked a blue/white light, moved at about 30 mph, made no noise except for a faint humming, and it appeared to not mind being detected.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Also, the three white lights on the craft were not attached to the craft, it was as though they were balls of energy, or something of that nature, that were floating in a hollowed out portion of the ship.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I watched it lurk its way over fields and even saw a small black SUV driving dangerously fast towards this unknown object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The last part of the objects show was the most mind puzzling.  It became on big ball of light of in! the distance, took a 90 degree turn, hovered over the horizon for some seconds, then flashed a light so bright it looked like lightning.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After this I didn&#39;t see it again.

My boyfriend was in the bathroom and he saw the flash and heard the rumble. I posted on FaceBook, and a woman immediately replied that she had just seen and heard the same thing in Edgartown.  Edgaratown and Aquinnah are both on the south shore...about 20 miles lay between them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This occurrance really shook me up.  Someone else mentioned that this is the second time in a month someone mentioned strange lights in the sky over Aquinnah.  It&#39;s very strange indeed.

Did anyone else see this?<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had just gone outside with my dog before bed, and noticed a strange golden light in the sky.  It appeared to be flying lower than an airplane or a helicopter, and was moving very slowly.  It seemed to come from the direction of Eastwood and was moving through Sedwick Farms.  At first, I did not hear any noise at all, but there was a significant breeze.  Then, as it approached my house through the trees, i could hear it.  It made a very quiet roar, much softer than that of an airplane.  The light it was emitting was so bright, that I could not distinguish if it was one light or several clumped together.  It passed over, and everything is quiet again.  I am a scientist and a skeptic, and I have never seen anything like this.  I would be lying if I said that I wasn&#39;t a bit shaken up at the moment.<n>

We saw a large object sort of triangle shaped, which looked to be a few 100 feet above us.  It was moving to the north west at a very rapid speed and completely silent.  The surface of it can only be described as reflective in the night sky.  It appeared to have very dim lights, atleast 3-4, but it was more like it was reflecting the city lights.  It was almost as if you were looking through a smudge on a window, moving at a rate of speed that was indescribable.  Another way to describe it would be like in a Star Trek movie when a Klingon ship was uncloaking.  Like a pool of water going across the sky.  We only saw it for a few seconds and it disappeared beyond the tree line.  Very amazing sight to see.  Wish we could describe it better.  The size was like that of a boeing 757 flying very low.<n>

We both spot and orb moving right to left above us, very high in the sky.  Was not pulsating, just an orb-like dot moving along.  We were amazed to say the least.  As the object was almost out of sight, a meteor-like object displayed above us and disappeared quick like a comet or a meteor shower.  But it was only one.  About 1 min after that I saw a bright light flash in the cloud above us and 3 f-16 planes appeared parallel to each other moving in the direction of the orb.  Also this is probably unrelated by I should mention that right after that I witnessed 10-12 albino bats flying around within 20-30 feet from us.  About 2 hours after that, we were still there as another business partner showed up.  Around 11pm or sometime between 11-12, we all witnessed a second orb identical to the previous one.  It was flying at the same rate of speed but a different direction.  Sightings like these ! don&#39;t change my life, weird things happen around me all the time but I thought it would be cool to post as their were 5 strange things in one evening.<n>

It stayed visible for approximately 30 seconds and appeared to get smaller in size as it moved towards the east as if also moving away from us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About five minutes later one of the adults yelled out “there are more of them”.  This time there were 3 of the same objects, at about the same distance (about the size of a ping-pong ball at arms length), traveling in single file with about 3 ping-pong ball size spaces between them.  However this time they moved more in a southern direction then made a wide turn and headed north.  Staying visible and getting ! smaller until they were out of sight. From the time we first saw this group of 3, until they were out of sight, lasted 60 seconds at most.<n> <n><n> <n><n> One of the adults called the local sheriffs dept to report what we had seen, the dept took his info and noted they were receiving other calls about the same thing at that time.

I live near the Mexican border in San Diego and I was facing south towards the horizon listening to my iPod when I notice a big green jolt of light shoot out of the horizon. It reminded me of something you see in Star Wars, the light changed from green to blue to purple, spreading across the night sky in a window shield wipe effect. I was so taken back from what I’ve saw, I stopped and looked around in the parking lot I was in and no one was there.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I saw a woman in a parked car and ask if she seen anything strange, but her back was facing from what I seen. She laughed and I laughed too (out of nervousness). I was still stunned from what I seen and trying to understand what I saw that lasted 5 seconds. As I was walking out of the parking lot and I saw two women who I passed by earlier while I was walking to the store. I asked if they so that light in the sky. They said they saw it also, I can tell they were scared and confused. We spoke for about 5 minutes trying to understand what we saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I went home still in disbelief. I know this wasn’t just some earthly phenomenon, something in my heart tells me it was something I will never understand. I tweeted what I saw asked if anyone in my city seen it. I got a response from some who lives about maybe 5 miles from where I saw it and she seen it too. I checked for the local news that night and no mentions and nothing from the Mexican news. The next few days I checked online and couldn’t find any reports. I tried to do some research of what I saw, but also couldn’t find anything close to what I saw that night.

I was on my way back from my best friends Marine Corps ITB graduation, in North Carolina.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I looked out to the left of the road into a valley between two mountains.  I saw what I thought was the top of a water tower.

As we got off on our home exit we noticed that there was something hovering over the capital, which was just east of our location.  We slowed down to look and see what it was. The object had three white lights in a triangle on the bottom. We joked about it being a UFO. As we turned on our home road we slowed down because we noticed that the object was no longer over the capital it was hovering roughly 150 feet above us to the left side of the car. One of us rolled down our window trying to prove that it was helicopter, even though it was the wrong shape, however the object was making no sound at all. As we continued driving down our road the aircraft followed parallel to us.  At this point I got scared and I directed that we not go home because I did not want whatever it was to know where we live. The aircraft proceeded to follow us as we went down different roads tryin! g to figure out what it was. As we were driving up a street suddenly the aircraft bolted away at a super high rate of speed. The aircraft went from being near us in the Rose Park area of Salt Lake to being near Antelope Island (roughly 30 miles away in a straight shot) in a matter of seconds. As we visually followed the aircraft over to the Island it met up  another aircraft. The aircraft&#39;s seemed to join together and then disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date is approximate.  PD))<n>

Definitely.So, i stare at it for about a couple minutes because the funny thing about this was that the airplane was not coming straight across like 99% of all planes do around my house.  So, this time the light was traveling vertically not horizontal and that&#39;s when i placed a strong concern of what this craft is. So, once i see the light coming above the trees where i can get a better look of what this is, i start to notice that this was not an airplane. As it began to raise velocity over the trees where i could see it better, it looked nothing like a airplane, it looked like a prymaid-like craft that had four likes under it one was red, another, was yellow, and another was white.I new this wasn&#39;t a plane because pla! nes don&#39;t directly travel through the sky. It didn&#39;t shoot up in the sky like normal UFO craft&#39;s do because at this time it was late, so no one would have noticed it.  But its a pyrmaid- like craft and it had four lights and it started to travel pretty fast through to the sky.  But the weirdest thing beyond this was that there were three stars in the sky and they were aligned. And as the craft is traveling up, the aligned stars begin to shift to the left of the sky, and its the best way i can describe it. Because the craft was moving at a fast but steady pace, definitely faster than a normal plane or jet fighter or whatever you call it. Fortunately, prior to my evidence, our town doesn&#39;t have a jet fighter air crafts. Just nearby airplane cruising areas. But this was amazing, I&#39;ve never seen anything like this, because i know it had to be something else other than any aircraft that we posess here on this earth. So, ill be more than happy to describe to you more about this hap! pening and we can continue to get the real story behind it. Th! ank you.<n>

The objects were each a dark orange and I would have missed seeing them entirely had I not been looking at Mars.  These three objects were much dimmer than Mars, and were traveling from due south to due north.  They made no sound and left no contrail as they passed almost directly overhead and transited the sky from a 45-degree elevation to about a 30-degree elevation from the southern and northern horizon, respectively.  The formation was an almost perfect isosceles triangle, with no positional deviation of any of the three objects relative to the other two during the sighting.  This was a formation and not a solid object as I observed a star through the center of the formation which was not obscured as it would be with a solid object.<n>

I was looking around while waiting for him to come in when I noticed an object hovering about 20ft above my cherry tree in my front yard. The tree is about 40ft from my house. I then noticed another object of same size and characteristics hovering over the house across from mine- about 80ft away. The first one flew over to the second one and I stood and observed the second one move quickly in four lateral directions randomly over my neighbor&#39;s house while the first slowly hovered around the second, no more that a couple feet away. The objects were small and appeared to be about 2ft in diameter, with a translucent haze around them and red, blue, and white lights on and inside them. They then moved on the the next house together, doing the same thing. I then went in the house to grab my camera and get my husband. He came with me outside and I noticed the objects above a house further (300-400ft) down! the street. I went to follow them with my camera but as soon as I got closer and tried to take a picture they seemed to react and moved quickly down the street out of sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

Far enough behind to be evident to not be a part of the main formation unless whatever I saw was huge.   from mid sky to the end of my visual horizon was about 6 seconds for them to move.

It took about 3 seconds to travel over half the distance of the sky before it dissappeared.  My 10 year old son saw it before me but I can not attest to what exactly he saw.  I have played this over in my head a hundred times and it seemed that this object was way up in the upper atmosphere.  This makes no sense.  It had to have been thousands of feet across to be seen from the ground.  There is no possible way this object was man made.  It travelled way too fast. I have been trying to come up with a different explanation for what I saw but I have come to the same conclusion that I had as it appeared and disappeared the night before last.

I had walked to the side of my home and was looking up at the sky while my dog was busy.  I was looking into the North West sky.  I was looking at what I believe was Jupiter and Venus.  The moon was in a last quarter phase so there was adequate moon light pollution.  As I switched my gaze to the West I saw what I thought was a very large white bird flying across the sky.  If anyone has ever seen the beauty of white birds flying in the moonlight then you would probably know what I am describing.  As I focused on this thing I quickly saw it was not a bird (I am getting teary and shivery thinking about it).  The UFO was triangle shaped and was travelling with one point of the triangle leading the direction of flight.  There were three small steady red, somewhat dim lights.  One light was in each corner of the UFO.  There was a distinct hull of some sort.  The closest thing I can compare the body t! o is one of those triangle break down reflectors large trucks carry.  It seemed as though the center portion of the triangle was either missing or very black.  It was like a triangle in a triangle.  There was no sound that I could hear.  The altitude was hard to tell.  The UFO blocked out light from the stars as it passed overhead.  The UFO took about 10 seconds to cross the night sky.  I do not know if it disappeared or because the lights on it were so dim I lost it in the light pollution over Minneapolis.  I also do not know if it just appeared when I first saw it or if it was moving into the moonlight where I could see it.  I am a middle aged mechanical engineer and a intermediate star gazer.  I am not excited easily.  As I watching this I was shivering, hairs on my neck were up and I wanted to cry.  When I think about this my eyes water.  I do not know if I am scared or excited because I have never felt this way when reflecting on an event.  Nothing I have ever seen has! made me feel this way.  I have seen other things in the sky b! ut this takes the cake.  I immediately drew it on paper once I was back in the house.  I showed my wife.  She was concerned.  She has never seen me act this way before.  I am so drawn to this I feel I need to write this.  I believed from a young age in UFO&#39;s.  I am very scientific and enjoy advanced Physics. I feel as though I am changed a little.  Also, there is a nuclear power plant less than 15 miles from my home and the sighting.  There is probably so much more to say but I am at loss for words.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

They appeared larger than a star and were moving in an eastern direction uniformly but very slow.   As they moved, 4 additional lighted objects appeared at the rear of the original formation.   I tried to get a photograph however my children were too frightened.  The lights varied in colors of white and light pink.  As they faded from view, it was if they disappeared individually.  They were observed above the tree line at a 75-90 degree angle from approximately 300 yards from the trees.  This was by far the strangest and most frightening thing I have ever witnessed.  My children were literally terrified.  I contacted our local Sheriff&#39;s office who had no other reports.   Both local airports were contacted by the Sheriff&#39;s Department and they had no reports either.  It was at the suggestion of the airport that this center be notified.  A phone call was also placed to the UFO Center on 3/14/2012 shortly after the sighting.  Local media was contacted but did not seem very interested - only that they would see if they had any other reports.<n>

On Monday, March 12, 2012 he was diving east to my house for late night work on some of his project deadlines.   He told me that he saw some very bright points of light low in the eastern sky at approximately 8 PM PST.  Upon arrival we both went outside the house looked in the sky and located Mars and the planet Venus high in the Western sky but I did not see anything unusual.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On Wednesday, March 14, 2012, the same thing happened but this time we both went upstairs in my bedroom that has a large window facing directly east.  This time I did observe at least 3 points of light at different and varying brightness from approximately 8PM to 8:30PM.  My observation was as follows:  (1)The objects were orange I and varied in brightness from brighter than Venus to the brightness of Mars.  There was no change in color, but the objects could suddenly vanish and reappear in a different place and could vary in brightness.  Most of the time they were about 15 – 20 degrees above the horizon (about one half of the angular height of Mars.)   (2) Since I used 5x50mm binoculars I could observe only one object at a time.  Because of trees and houses across the street there was limited areas that allowed for view much below 10 degrees above the horizon.  I will report only the movement of one bright object because the others had similar motion.<n> <n><n> <n><n> (3) At times the object would stay totally still in one place for as long as 5 minutes and then would move.  I could tell that because it was either close to a given branch of a tree or the roof of the house across the street.  The movement was usually to the left or right and less often vertically (up or down).   The speed varied in reference to fixed, nearby object.  It would move (sometimes accelerated) then stop or even disappear.  At times there was only one object visible at other times at least three.  I repeat again, these were more or less points of light whose size could not be estimated and therefore the distance could be millions of miles from the earth.  If that were the case then the speed at which they moved would be extremely fast.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In the early &#39;60’s I was a navigator for USAF.  In that period we depended on celestial navigation and I was intimately familiar with all of the bright stars (by name) and position of the planets at different seasons.  Later I acquired advanced degree in physics and worked for USAF as a research scientist, engineer and on various code name space programs such as GPS.  I can truly say that this observation was most interesting and strange.  I cannot call these objects UFO’s because the objects could be well outside the earth atmosphere where we normally do not use the term &#34;fly.&#34;<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke via telephone with this witness, and he sounded to us to be quite objective and credible, in his description of the sighting.

I arrived around 3.15pm and decided to have a coffee out on the deck which offered one of Auckland’s best views from high up on the Western ranges (Waitakere Ranges) looking back over West Auckland in an Easterly direction to Auckland city.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The day was bright and sunny though I’d noticed that today Auckland (unusually) had a haze over it. I had just taken a couple of pictures of the surrounds and was enjoying my coffee when I felt compelled to look skywards, I noticed an airborne object which was a darkish saucer shape and it was hovering a couple of Km’s off into the distance, (The distance is relatively hard to judge) though given that it was appearing past the line formed by the ranges means the object was quite large and must have also been quite a considerable distance away from my vantage point.<n> <n><n> <n><n> To my naked eye the object was relatively small and had a darker bottom section and shinier (?Metallic) top portion. I’d characterise the object as being a “large bug size” from where I was standing and it appeared in the sky at about the height of a low flying aeroplane.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There it sat wobbling and occasionally glinting light (which I assumed was a reflection from the sun) this was only for a very short while in the sky over the Henderson Valley. (I’m not certain about the exact point over which it was hovering)  I couldn’t identify what the object was though knew it was something of interest that I hadn’t seen before so quickly grabbed my camera and took a shot. I lowered my camera and managed to see the object for a brief moment, it appeared to have vapours beneath it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It then ”flashed” and disappeared off to the left vertically on an angle perhaps 65-70 Degrees. After this it was completely gone from sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There were no other objects in the sky at the same time as this sighting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Looking at the picture through my camera’s small rear screen the object didn’t look all that impressive so I waited till I got home and connected my camera to my HDTV.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Two other patrons (a couple) were dining though they didn’t see the object and it being a matter of only a couple of seconds before it left after taking the photo I didn’t have time to alert them before it disappeared. It all happening so quickly and me not being certain of what had just happened I thought it wise not to appear like someone delusional in front of two complete strangers.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have spent days trying to debunk this sighting myself, …. Perhaps it’s a blimp… perhaps a large cicada with wings on the downbeat…though it is too far off to be a cicada or any type of bird. The object was metallic and saucer shaped, it also disappeared in a flash!!  As a trained scientist I always use a methodical and analytical approach to problem solving, this time I have come up with no good answer as to what it is I witnessed over West Auckland- perhaps then this constitutes a UFO?<n>

Above the town of Lafayette, ahead of me, I could see something rectangular in shape spiraling upward into the air, above what seemed to be the area just east of Highway 287 and the intersection of Baseline Rd.  The bright object was silvery and highly reflective.  It would disappear when the flat surfaces were not hit directly by the sunlight.  When the object changed position so that the flat surfaces reflected the sun, the object appeared to be rectangular in shape, with a tip pointing up into the sky.  The trajectory was in a slightly south and strongly easterly direction and about a 45 or 50 degree angle.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About 20 or 30 seconds after the first object appeared and was ascending, a second one followed at the same angle.  Both objects shone in the sunlight, spiraling (not in unison) upward.  The second object almost caught up to the first object when suddenly, neither was visible any more.  I am uncertain if they entered the clouds or simply disappeared, but I did not see them any longer.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was a black helicopter flying northward to the west of Highway 287 when these objects were visible.  It seemed to be almost parallel to them, lower in altitude, when they were at their highest points.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I got to the vicinity of Arapahoe Rd., I stopped and got out of the car to go to a store.  This was just a few moments after seeing the objects.  I did not see any sign of the objects or hear aerobatic airplanes or jet sounds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I wondered if I had been seeing fighter jets take off from Metropolitan Airport, 5 miles or so beyond Lafayette.  I do not think this is the case, because the objects would have been much smaller at that distance, and I don’t think their shapes would have been discernible, though reflection off them probably would have been visible.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There is an airport in Erie, close to where I was when I saw these objects, but that airport would have been almost directly east of me, and possibly slightly north, behind me, when I saw these objects.<n>

Tonight I observed starting about three hours ago a light that varied between red and white doing what appeared to be moving erratically in the southwestern quarter of the sky.  At first sighting I was not sure of its movement and suspected based on its color that the object might be the planet mars, as I was unsure of its exact coordinates tonight.   At second sighting it had moved slightly more to the south and I figured it was definitely a planet, though I still observed both what seemed to be an up and down bobbing motion and a change between red and white lights that seemed to imply a rotational motion.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My third sighting I observed the object for the longest period of time, since it had now gone far to the northwestern quarter of the sky and both the bobbing and the phasing of colors was far more apparent. I could only see the lights still and with little other info, I could  not ascertain the size or shape or distance of the object.  Eventually, after bobbing like what seemed to be lower and closer, it stayed white and became a more stable and less bright point of light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We suspect a sighting of a celestial body.

One on each corner and then a slow pulsing one underneath; all whitish looking and no sound at all.  There was what appeared to be an upside-down cockpit similar to what F22s use, colour of a gun-metallic design, with the pulsing light in the middle; again on the underside of the craft.  It made no noise and hovered over a vacant field nearby.  Me and my wife observed it for a few moments before it started to rotate in an odd manner; instead of turning right, it did a complete 270 degree turn to do this and then proceeded to move off slowly as if for us to follow it, then it moved at a gradual pace until it was out of sight.  After chasing it and loosing it, we return to near our home where we found it again hovering nearby as if it was waiting for us. We chased it again and it did the same thing and towards the same direction; towards Boston.  After finally giving up again, it was coming along side us, backing straight up (the long end of the triangle rather than the point)and waiting to see if we would continue again until it decided to move off after seeing we had lost interest.  There was a little bit later a water-craft plane (the type that can land on water that is) fly over head, but you could clearly tell what it was versus how clear the other craft was to us. In all this, I had always liked the thought of UFOs, but doubted they truly existed or that really it could never happen to me; in this case now, I think differently.<n>

I was listening to wireless radio (pandora) from cell phone.  I had been experiencing interference (lots of static) all evening.   This had never happened before.   I had just witnessed shooting star and satellite (very bright at one point) 10-15 minutes earlier.   Shortly after I witnessed two airforce jets in trail heading back to Seymore Johnson Airforce base in Goldsboro.  The sky was clear (no commercial jets).   I noticed four orange/red lights moving in triangle pattern North over Greenville.   It looked almost holographic.   Then the lights banked and moved towards a Northwest direction.  There was no sound until lights banked.  I heard a woosh sound like wind passing through the trees.   Lights appeared to be 10,000 to 20,000 feet above ground.  It appeared to be a military craft.<n>

I was outside in hottub at around 8:40 PM central time on the night of 3-18-12.  It was very clear and a nice starry night.  I had seen a plane (jet) just 30 seconds before flying from E to W very high over the Twin Cities at cruising altitude (like a NY to Seattle flight or something like that.)  Then, flying roughly SE to NW at a higher altitude, I saw two dots, offset from one another-not side by side, like that of a plane, but, farther apart and nothing visible in between them.  They were brownish color, much higher and much, much faster.  That is why I say about 10 seconds because the plane I mentioned previously took probably 30-40 seconds to fly across my vision in the sky.  This thing took about 10 seconds.  It was definitely an object or one thing OR two things flying synchronized-which would be more my guess.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Saw it for about 1 second before it &#34;cloaked&#34;.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was walking my dog on the evening of March 13, 2012 at 8:30pm. I walk her around the school, which is located behind my house. There is a large field with baseball diamonds etc. I was checking out the Venus/Jupiter view constantly as I walked because I thought it was really cool to see them so bright and close. There were also absolutely no clouds in the sky. Towards the end of our walk, I was in an area where there was no light so it was pretty dark area. I looked up to check out the planets again and immediately saw what my brain told me was an airplane. Then after about 1 second it disappeared. The way it disappeared was a little alarming because it didn’t “zoom off” as the way most people describe. The best way I could describe is that it looked like it had “cloaked” it self. It was there and the seemed to quickly dissolve from the front to the back. The object was moving forward, the same speed a plane would move and there was no sound and no other mo! ving objects in the sky where I was looking. We have a lot of airplane traffic above my house that are sometimes pretty low and that’s what I thought I was seeing. Once I saw what looked like it had cloaked, I immediately stopped walking and stood still to really observe what I saw. There was nothing in the sky. I kept searching for what I saw but nothing. I then started to try to debunk what I saw. There are large lights in the field to light up the baseball diamonds but I cannot see any light from them from the vantage point due to being on the opposite side of the school and blocked by the building. The object I saw would have been positioned as if they were above these lights. So I was seeing this object above the school building and lights. I then stepped back from where I spotted the object about 3 or 4 steps and I could see the tops of the lights. I thought maybe there is a beam of light that is shooting upwards, but all of the lights point down to the baseball field! s. The only thing I could think of is that something flown abo! ve the l ights and was illuminated for a second by a light beam, but the sky was so clear I would have been able to see the object beyond the beam. It was also up to high for any beam of light to illuminate it. There was no sound and it looked like a plane, and it had a few lights on it. I thought maybe it was a crane since this is near the water and I have seen cranes nesting up on the lights before, but again it was up higher than that for it to be a crane, it was too large to be a bird like a crane also. And again I would have been able to see it beyond any lights since the sky was so clear. The object was like a small plane with no wings and lights. The best way I can recall the shape is the shape of the ship in the video game r-type (http://www.gamechronicles.com/reviews/ps2/rtype/ship2.gif). The ship would have been facing the opposite direction and moving away but at the same angle. I did stand there for a good 2 or 3 minutes without moving just so I could really see if anythi! ng else happened. I did not see anything else after that.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

To the passing eye, they appear to be REALLY bright stars, but upon closer inspection, you realize the lights are too close to be a star and the light is not star-like.  Every once in a while a bright bluish orb will drop from it, almost looking like a shooting star, but slower.  I watched this from my bedroom window, using a nearby tree as a reference point, and it rotated and moved before my eyes, then after several hours disappears.  We have seen this phenomenon every night for the past two weeks.  One neighbor got this on his iphone and said between 5 and 6am it was closer to the ground for him to see the distinct outline of the triangle shape and it made no noise, only a beam was lightly shining on the ground, like a helicopter spotlight, only it made no noise and was massive in size.<n>

With my brother in-law who witnessed the whole event.It is about a mile walk back to my house so I have plenty of time to look at the sky. No city lights for miles makes for great viewing.  This night I could clearly see a large orange light slowly moving to the west.  There was no flashing lights just a steady orange light.  Bigger than the rest of the stars in the sky.  Moving at a steady pace. It moved behind the tree tops, then much to my surprise it stopped dead in its tracks.  The light set steady in one spot for close to 10-15 minutes. Hard to be exact on how long I stood there staring.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Through the trees I could see it start to head to the north for maybe 30 seconds then made an immediate upward motion.  The object never left the area it was in and continued to move around the sky in odd movements.  The light never dimmed like a plane or a light that is turning away from you.  Roughly 45 minutes after noticing the object it was suddenly gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On 3/13/12 I stepped out onto my porch and was simply looking around at how clear the sky was and all the stars.  I looked to my east and noticed the same orange light up in  the sky.  This time it was already doing its funny moving around flying one direction for a few seconds then heading in another.  I yelled for my wife to come outside and see the object I had told her about. We stood out and watched it for a few minutes before I drove down the road to see if it could be a r/c heli or something similar. I drove 3 miles down the road in search of this object.  The object was just like all the rest of the stars in the sky, never got any closer to it.  I turned around realizing it was much farther away than I had thought. It was seen for about an hour total that night.  Again around 8 or 9 pm.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On 3/14/12 I was out fishing again til just after dark with my brother in-law again.  This time I was looking for it.  The light was in the same general direction moving around behind the tree tops.  Makes it easier to see its movements.  This night myself and 3 others wife, brother in-law, and his wife all seen the light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There wasn&#39;t ever any sound associated with this light or any other flashing with the light.

It was still very dark the sun was not yet rising.  I was looking SW in the sky. I saw a stationary light just above the horizon..  At first I thought it was maybe a helicopter because it was not moving. I saw another light approach the stationary light then suddenly 4-5 lights dropped out of the stationary light straight down to the ground.  The stationary light disappeared. I watch the sky for another 20 minutes but saw nothing<n>

It was very cloudy,  The clouds were very thick and moving kinda fast.  All of a sudden we seen an object in the sky moving out of the clouds,  We knew it was not a star because the stars were not moving.  The object we seen had 4 other objects following it. about 10 secods after that 5 other objects were following the other objects as if they were going somewhere, or maybe getting away from something.  These objects were a little bit bigger than stars.  But appeared as stars. It was very strange,  They were moving a moderate speed.  These objects were moving south west.  Towards Columbus, Ohio.  It was strange, Like nothing I have ever seen before.<n>

I remember thinking to myself how small we really are in the universe, and how much we really still don&#39;t understand.  And at that moment me and my girlfriend looked up into the sky and we noticed 4 glowing balls of light moving at a descent speed.  I wasn&#39;t sure at first what they were.  They came out from behind a cloud in a tranglier movement heading Southwest.  After the four objects flew right over they dispeared into the clouds.  And as those four went behind the clouds six more came out from behind the clouds moving in a straight line. They seemed to be in the shape of a average star. The light omencing from these circular objects were white bright lights.<n>

I left my house and drove down court st toward the eastwood section of syracuse when i instantly saw this rectangle looking thing in the sky hovering low in and out of the clouds over eastwood-lyncourt area of syracuse,ny.  It had white and red circle lights on it from left to right and the red lights look l.e.d-ish. not bright but not dim and the white lights looked a little blue.   the airport is nearby and i ruled out any airplanes or helicopters because there was an airplane getting ready to land and that didnt look like any helicopter.  There were about ten cars on the road around me.  it didnt make any noise and i heard that they were testing drones at the airport but that wasn&#39;t any drone and why would a drone be out when passenger planes are trying to land?/! I saw the same thing earlier this month in the same spot around the same time.  I tried to call my girlfriend but th! e phine didn;t have any signal until i didn&#39;t see it anymore and then the call went through.  I am a very skeptical person but this is something i can&#39;t explain and i can;t find anything on the net about it but i did find a video of what im talking about on youtube...&#34;ufo over syracuse&#34; is the nave of the video and it sure looks exactly like what i saw.<n>

As I looked at them I also saw two bright orange lights like lines in the sky in the west moving to the east.  The orange lines appeared to be the size of large planes but had bright orange liights on the bottome of the plane from the nose to the tail.  I watched them as they came closed.  As they got almost overhead, the left one started disappearing but the right one (north side) turned into a large bubble or balloon.  I watched it go down as I looked to the northwest.  I could see it through the branches of a big tree.  I stood in amazement thinking I had seen a UFO.  Then in the west there was two more of the long orange lines.  Again I watched them.  The one on the right started going over my house and the one on the left turned into a big balloon.  I watched it go down as it disappeared on the other side of the house next door to me.  I&#39;m sure it was much farther away but looked closer.  I di! d not hear any sounds that sounded like an airplane going over.  The orange lights were very bright.

I made my phone call to a friend, we were talking about corned beef and cabbage, and then I felt a force coming at me as if it was pushing me back in my seat...and there was a light.  As if coming out of a cloud, it was goldish yellow light coming straight at me.  I&#39;m looking at it trying to figure out what it is and I tell the person on the phone &#34;there&#39;s a yellow light coming at me, there&#39;s a yellow light coming at me&#34;.  At a distance it stopped and it looked as if it was vibrating or shaking side to side.  It then stopped vibrating...it stayed there and I was just staring at it.  Then it came closer to me, stopped and then started vibrating/shaking again.  Then the vibrating stopped and I could see that it was real round.  It  hovered approximately 1000 feet right in front of me, coming from the west. I am staring at it and it seemed to me that it was staring back, I felt an energy.  I&#39;m confused so I tell the person on the phone&#34; I feel it looking at me and I&#39;m just looking at it and I can&#39;t do anything&#34; my friend says &#34; I think it&#39;s a UFO, get out of the car and take a picture &#34;  At that point the oval yellow object is slowly moving over my car and across the road.I physically got out of my car to take the picture with my cell phone, it had sped up, but I was still able to get a picture.  The object then went higher into the sky, stopped, then lowered straight down over some trees,I could see the UFO clearly (the yellow light), stayed there for a while, a couple seconds, then went down as if it was landing and disappeared.

The sun had set and it was dark out, but not quite pitch black. There wasn’t a cloud in the sky and you could see the stars and the moon easily. It was one of the nicer evenings. I was driving down Robinson Canyon in Ellensburg, Washington, on my way back from my step sister&#39;s house headed home to my house about 3 miles from where I was.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was listening to the radio at the time, and remember checking my watch at around 7:45 P.M. to make sure I would be home by 8:00 P.M., when my mother wanted me home. I looked up from the watch, and looked up into the distance. There were 3 bright, white/yellow lights in a triangle formation above and to the left of the long, straight road I was driving on. It looked as if it was traveling towards me. I continued to drive a little further.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I approached the aircraft, I looked around and there were no other cars on the road, so I stopped my car, turned off the radio and got out of the vehicle to see if I could hear any noise from the aircraft, there was literally no noise at all.  No sound of a propeller, no sound of a jet engine..nothing.  The night was completely silent.  The only thing I heard was the noise from my car engine (which isn’t very loud anyway), and I figured that if it was something with an engine, I would be able to hear it over my car’s engine considering how low it was.  Judging from my experiences flying through the valley, it was probably at about 3,000, 3,500 feet AGL.  It was moving so slow that I could only tell that it was moving from references on the ground, but it was not hovering.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I stood there on the road next to my car watching it for about 4 or 5 minutes, until it was directly under where I was stopped on the road. I looked up at it and could barely make out the shape of the aircraft. It was in a triangle shape. There was one red, flashing light underneath and in the center the aircraft, and 3 white/yellow lights on each tip. The white/yellow lights were not flashing. I sat there for another 2-3 minutes watching it, when a car started approaching me from the distance on the road. I decided to leave. I thought maybe it was just an aircraft from the local military base, doing a test flight of some sort, so I decided to not to think much of it.  I got back in the car and drove off, about thirty seconds after I started driving, I looked back in my rear view mirror to see if I could see it, and it wasn’t there.  I looked behind me, it was gone.  I stuck my head out the window to see if it was behind my car, and not in my line of sight, I still couldn’t see! anything. The night sky was completely clear.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It literally had disappeared.  The lights were gone, (I thought maybe the operators turned off the lights because they knew I was watching or something) and I could not even see the shape of the aircraft anymore, I couldn’t see the aircraft at all.  I do not know what this thing was.  I assumed it came from the Yakima Training Center, most likely a test aircraft of some sort.  But I, being the believer that I am, strongly believe that it was something “not from this world”.  That night when I got home, I told my siblings and mom what I had saw.  Of course they didn’t believe me. I decided to just keep it to myself.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Also, at the time the thought never occurred to me to take a picture.  After I got home that night, I deeply regretted that I didn&#39;t.<n>

Just before it disappeared into the clouds I saw a glimmer or a light come through it but it was not airplane lights.  I am absolutely sure of that.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My initial thought was the sun hit it but that would have been impossible because of the heavy cloud cover that day.  The whole event took approximately 20 seconds before it disappeared.  I am sure that it was not an airplane (no wings) nor was it a helicopter or a bird.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Also there was no sound.  It was within a half a mile from where I was standing.  I ran to get a better look because of the trees but it disappeared into the clouds.<n>

Then as I reached in my pocket for the car keys something caught my attention, at first I thought it might be a shooting star, but then I quickly realized from the shapes and movements that they had to be something else.  I watched two dome shaped yellowish-white lights move across the sky in a north east direction, each moving back and forth but continuing forward.  The lights did not blink like an airplane&#39;s or were small and bright like the rescue helicopters that fly to the hospital nearby, the lights were constant yet large and dim, pointing straight down.  I wasn&#39;t able to see if their was any other shapes that they might have been ommitting from, my only assumption is that they were two separate units flying together.  I was initial shocked to look up and see such a thing happenin! g right here in my home town.  What solidifies my conclusion that they definitely UFO&#39;s, is that for the low altitute, roughly 150ft above the ground, their was absolutely no sound at all.  If they were planes or helicopters it would have been load enough to hear.  I sorry I don&#39;t have any more info.  I simply stood in amazement and watch until the objects continued out of sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

About one minute later my wife came running into our bedroom and went to our bedroom window asking me to come quickly and look at some lights she had saw in the sky and ask me if I had ever seen anything like that.  (I am a ten year navy veteran who worked on an aircraft carrier and flight line.)<n> <n><n> <n><n> I quickly got up to and rushed to the window and I observed a large array of lights in the sky flying right over our house heading northeast moving rather quickly.  The array of lights appeared to be about ¼ to ½ mile or more in length at about ½ to ¾ mile from the ground.  I initially saw a long row of white flashing light, in an inverted &#34;Chevron&#34; pattern; I couldn’t initially count how many lights because I was looking out a window with a screen on it.  But the flashing lights had no distinct flashing pattern to them but they did have with intermittent red/orange being trailed by two other white lights from behind that were not flashing at all.<n> <n><n> <n><n> But, what was weird was that as each of the larger white lights flashed there came sparkling white lights all around that specific light that resembled light sparkling from a sparkler.  But I could not discern a distinct shape from my vantage point.<n> <n><n> <n><n> During this time my wife ask me if I could hear the noise it was making and it was at this point I noticed a faint, low, dull, continual roaring sound.  My wife and I quickly ran to our back yard sliding door to get a better look at this thing or things.  By the time we reached and opened the back door I could faintly hear the sound which was growing fainter and it was at this time I observed the array of lights and it was at this point I could see five distinct larger lights with this barrage of sparkling lights all around them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My wife reported that what she saw was five distinct lights surrounded by these strange sparkling lights but she claims that these lights in a &#34;Chevron&#34; pattern were not flying as to be pointing to the horizon, as a squadron of jets would fly, but the point of the chevron was pointing to the ground as they fly over her!  This seemed weird to me.   We observed that all the lights were moving at the same rate of speed and because it was a dark night we could not tell if it was a single aircraft or multiple aircraft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Not sure if you folks can help us identify what this was but we are curious if others have witnessed something like this in the past.  Thank you for your time.<n>

Photo is conclusive.  PD))<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> Around 20:55 last night I received a text message from my father with an image file.  In the image I could see the street he resides on and in the sky there were two distinct lights.  He informed me that the lights had hovered into the area and had remained there for ten minutes or so.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I arrived at his house at 2110, and looked at the object through a pair of binoculars. There were two primary lights that could be seen with the naked eye, and a faint oval or cigar shape behind the lights.  The lights and outline of the object were in front of a group of clouds, therefore safe to assume that it was in our atmosphere. We continued observing for another ten minutes and began taking photos.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object remained North-West/West of our position as we observed it.  My wife and I got in my truck and decided to head in that direction for a closer look.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We took the main road out of my parent’s neighborhood going southbound.  My wife commented that the object remained in her window until a building blocked her view.  Once reaching a stop sign where I was going to turn north-west to get a better look at the object, I noticed it had appeared at my 12 o&#39;clock.

I was having troubles sleeping all night so figured a quick breath of air would be pleasant.  Due to the time change for daylights savings it was still dark out.  As soon as I stepped out of the building, in the skyline ahead of me was a flashing very very fast orb.  It was at a distance in the sky and high up so the shape was unclear but if I didnt know better I would have mistaked it for an airplane, but its speed was just way too intense and the colors flashing were just strange and not at all of aircraft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It passed over and a patch of trees blocked my vision. I ran out quickly to get a better look beyond them and it was gone.  I tried to ride it off and treked to the mailboxes.  Just out of paranoia, I looked up from there after retrieving my mail and cursed myself because again, I saw a strange distant orb/circle crossing amongst the stars.  It actually looked like a star, a dull gray orb not f! lashing like the other, but it was speeding along in the same manner.  It wasnt a shooting star because it didnt curve, it kept a steady streaming pace. Then as it passed by a very bright starlike object a tad bigger, it stopped, and moved BACKWARDS towards this star or whatever, and disappeared it seemed INTO it. Im not very savvy when it comes to aircraft, or astral phenomenon...but what object or projectile flys foreward...then suddenly puts it in reverse?  Im baffled, and in honesty sitting here with all the lights on after running into the house.  This is not my only abnormal circumstance after moving to Ohio since 1 year ago.<n>

I extended my arm to the sky stretching my thumb and pinky finger out until I could fit the unusually large object in between the empty space.  There was about 6 inches of space between thumb and pinky.

I drove to Surfers Point where the light could be best seen.  The object would swoop down as low as the tree tops and vanish but with tonight&#39;s moonlight I could see a complete outline of it when the lights turned off.  It is a toy plane with LED lights attached and whoever was controlling it had a remote to turn the lights on and off. Debunked.<n>

The objects were moving against the few clouds, and at a much faster speed then the background starfield.  They were diagonally positioned to one another as well, the right one being lower.  There were two other craft in our field of vision at the time we saw these.  It is difficult to know what type of craft were there, or if they were in pursuit or observing the objects.<n>

Helicopter-like noise but no helicopter.<n> <n><n> <n><n> While bringing groceries in from my car, I head what sounded at first like extremely low flying helicopters. I looked up to the trees and watched for whatever was making such a sound to come over and appear over the trees.  What came into view was a bright bluish orb, like a star floating through the sky and immediately following it was a second craft, so close it looked like it was chasing the orb. the second craft had three solid lights, one blue one red one green.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As the first craft flew directly over my head I could see it was not just an orb but a dark or black colored cigar shaped craft moving quietly and stealthily with no other visible lights.  If it were not for the tiny blue orb at it&#39;s tip it would not have been easily detectable.  It seemed as though this craft was indeed trying to go unnoticed.  The second craft followed so closely it looked like it might catch the first object and I thought to myself how is it avoiding flying directly into the rear of the first object it was hard to tell but I seemed as though the second craft was the one that sounded like a highly advanced and maybe military heli - but I could see in the silhouette it was cigar shaped and not anything like a heli I have ever seen flying at night.  This craft had only three solid lights, nothing flashing as I have seen all other heli&#39;s do in my area and it seemed to be chasing the first object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The crafts were so low they looked like they were about to land in a field on the other side of the street but they didn&#39;t.  I just kept thinking what is that first craft doing flying so low with no lights on?! And why is this other craft chasing it?!  I know in my gut these were not airplanes nor helicopters.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The craft disappeared over the trees. I came into the house to tell my boyfriend and he beat me to saying that he also heard the low flying craft, yet knew from the sound it didn&#39;t sound like any plane or helicopter.<n>

On one corner was a red light that blinked at longer intervals than the other two white lights at the other corners.  The white lights blinked back and forth quickly and the the blinked once every few times the white ones alternated.  A green light that bursted three blinks at a time was located between the white lights along that side of the triangle.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Upon first seeing the craft it was stationary.  It moved the first time real quickly from its sitting position like it had no need to build thrust with the air like a hovering helicopter would have to do.  It only moved a short distance and stopped again.  I had meanwhile called my cousin to see if he could see it but his house was too far away to view the object probably due to the object not being high enough in the air and clouds.  I also had pulled over into a parking lot so I could remain seeing it as long as possible.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I pulled over it moved slowly but at a decent rate southward.  My wife and eye watched it for another minute or so as it moved behind trees in the distance.  We didn&#39;t want to actually believe we saw that but the fact is we did and I felt it needed reported.  Others had to have seen the object for sure because many people were out and about but I figured not that many people care enough to report these things.<n>

It was traveling from East to West.  I commented to him that it was the “oddest light” I’d ever seen!  It wasn’t flashing, it was a constant light and it wasn’t falling like a “falling star.” As my friend turned and looked we saw another come into view directly behind but some distance away. Then 2 more came into view and then the last one.  If I could describe the pattern, the second appeared to be in line with the first, the next 2 were spread further apart but aligned with one another and the last one was in direct alignment straight behind the first and second. If you could draw lines between them, they would look like below:<n> <n><n> <n><n> First Light   Second light                               Third Light    Fourth Light     Fifth Light<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have NEVER seen anything like this before and neither has my friend who at one time had his pilot’s license!  We were in such amazement we stared for some time before I started filming. I can’t see much if anything on my video so I took still photos of what was left.  The objects started to ascend into the atmosphere in the same order they appeared.  My only camera was my cell phone. You have to move the screen around and enlarge it to see the photos I got.  In one shot as you enlarge it the object appears to be linear in shape but with the naked eye my best description is fireballs.  I have been reluctant to report for fear of being ridiculed if my name was revealed but I’m so intrigued I had to share.  We watched the news that night and the next day, and read the paper, and as best we can tell, no one else reported.  I kept looking on line for any reports in the following days but have found nothing about this incident there either.<n>

At first we believed to this to be nothing more than the common troll you run across online.  After reading into it and pulling the cards, numerously those of us using the Americanzed decks were pulling nines of gags, suggesting a trickster spirit was at hand.  When those of us in orient switched to our tibetan decks we were pulling the fours of chan, a popular folklore hero who was known to worship trickster spirits.  We decided to do a remote reading session which revealed some troubling things.  After a field trip on the astral plane we did discover that something is going on and someone is messing with the minds of citizens of our planet.  What I am about to reveal is not only troubling but is a cause for alarm.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On March 23 of 2012.  There will be a massive sighting of 4 red lights in the sky, they will blink for a few seconds, following will be a bright flash of light.  The light will be so intense people will be forced to protect their eyes.  From the point in the sky where this flash occurs there will be a long trail in the sky. It will resemble an airplanes chemtrail but much bigger and glowing as if it is more than condensed water.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Gary, Fae, Angel, Linden, Isiah, Warlock, and myself do not believe these are aliens as will be suggested by many.  It is to our understanding that this is infact a government cover up.  These lights are a signal to the people who have had their minds tampered with.  A sorta light switch will be turned on that will cause people to react differently than they normally would.  What it&#39;s entire intent is, we do not know.  We do know not everyone will be affected nor will everyone see the lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We wish to warn people and make them aware of this event.  We&#39;re not sure what will occur if anything at all. Nor do we legitly believe this is a doom and gloom situtation.  The basis of the entire thing seems to be linked to the mental tamperings done by our Government.  We suggest everyone prepare themselves just encase.<n> <n><n> <n><n> God speed and love for all.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((name deleted)) Psychic, spiritual advisor,  &amp; tarot reader.<n>

While in my kitchen I saw a flash of light through the curtains and it startled me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I went to open the door to look outside and saw storm-clouds rolling by overhead, so I figured the flash must have been from lightning.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I shut the door, I saw a bright flash light up the window again, but this time it was sustained for a few seconds, much like car headlights in the window (which was impossible because window isn&#39;t facing a road or any cars) but a lot more brilliant.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I reached for the door and went outside, walked to the front of the building where I lived and looked out up the street to the main thoroughfare (4th avenue). At the corner of 4th and and 27th street, just above a restaurant that is there, a hub-cap shaped object hovered roughly 40-45 feet above the street.  It was silver in color, had some small lights on the edge of it and on the top, ranging from red, green and white.  I&#39;d estimate the disc itself approximately 75 feet in diameter.  Underneath it looked like a series of pulsing lightning bolts firing inward to a central point, similar to spokes on a bicycle tire.  The &#34;lightning bolts&#34; were an odd color, like the blue of a gas flame.  There was a misty blue &#34;aura&#34; on the underside of the object as well.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Object was quiet and I don&#39;t recall hearing any sound with it, but I felt a strong sense of static in the air.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I don&#39;t know why, but I only watched the object for a few seconds, then I turned around,  went back to my apartment and went back to bed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> For some reason I have a dream-like partial memory of seeing the same object hovering over my apartment building, blotting out a portion of the cloudy night sky.

I live close to the Bloomington IL airport and am used to hearing and seeing planes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This was not like anything I have ever seen before and it was completely silent.  I did have the thought that it may be multiple planes flying in formation, but the lights did not look like lights I&#39;ve ever seen on a plane before.   In addition to that, it would have been about a dozen planes flying in a perfect V formation which does not seem likely.  It was not moving across the sky very fast so it was either low and slow, or at a pretty high altitude.  If this object was moving the speed of a normal jet and at about the same altitude as them then it was much larger than any passenger plane.   I have no idea what this thing was.  The only thing I&#39;ve ever seen before this that looked anything like it was from a Discovery tv show about UFOs.  I&#39;m not exactly convinced it was some alien spaceship, but I do know it wasn&#39;t something we normally see flying around.<n>

When i went up to his door i glanced around and happened to see a bunch of strange lights through the trees that divided his property from the neighbors property.  My friend was on the phone when he answered the door, and when i saw the lights i became curious and decided to walk back towards the edge of the property where i could better see them.  As i stood watching them i noticed that the lights were moving.  There was a group of about 8 to 10 lights congregated and 2 lights that seemed to be following the larger group from a distance.  The larger group of lights seemed to be spaced apart from one another in a way that formed a kind of half moon shape.  Each light that was in the half moon shape seemed to be at almost a perfect distance from each other.  There were also a few lights around the half moon shape that were not part of this alignment.  As i realized that what i was seeing was something i couldn&#39;t exp! lain i decided to call my friend over and point out what i was seeing.  Once my friend saw the lights we continued to watch and follow them on foot as they moved west.  They didn&#39;t make any abrupt movements, however some of them moved up and down in the sky and some seemed to hover in one spot while others moved more quickly.  After a short period of time some of the lights began to dim. It was like one of those touch lamps with different settings of brightness on it.  Some of the lights seemed to dim quicker than others, but before disappearing completely they looked white like a star.  There also seemed to be a red blinking light that became more visible as the light dimmed.  The lights at their brightest looked similar to an orb or candle flame if you could control the shape of flame to a circular shape.  My friend was able to capture a short video of the two lights that seemed to be following the larger congregation of lights.  Whatever these objects were they did not give off ! any sound.  Also, at one point one of the lights moved towards one of t he other lights. When the light got close to the other light it dimmed out and disappeared.<n>

I have been taking pictures of ‘flashes’ in our night sky for several years, and while at first they were thought to be airplanes, the activity was strange.  The would be eight to ten flashes all over the area and would travel  in every direction in the same area of time. (and each night it was the same time)The rest of the night (anyway when I’d check) there is nothing. There might not be  anything for weeks or months and then maybe once or twice during a month it would be there again .However since last Oct. it has been almost every night (recently the amount may dwindle to a couple a night rather than what has been ). It was the same for Oct. through Dec. the year before, almost every night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The images I get after having to enlarge the tiny image that comes out on the back of the camera are amazing. They sure are NOT airplanes!!! I have hundreds upon hundreds of different things. I have also gained much knowledge from watching them over the months. I’d heard that the atmosphere can cause ‘images’ to be colors but they are really white. NOT true. I have two in the same picture and one is totally colorful while the other is white.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On March 9th I captured on ‘still shot’ a whole series of pictures of a moving UFO. What it turned out being  is the same image as I’ve have in many pictures over the months. THIS time I have it ‘moving’ so I now know it has propulsion. I have a Nikon D 300 VR camera with a VR 70-300  Nikkor lens. I have the camera placed on a heavy vibration controlled tripod and use a shutter release cord.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was caught off guard when instead of flashing lights I saw an object careening downward from the East going South and it isn’t ’way up’ in the sky (as the others also haven’t been).  I could see the trail of fast moving ‘air’ behind it and the air rolled around within the trail.  It did not look or stay like a contrail. I could see the image but it was moving so fast I couldn’t make out what it was until I looked back on the camera.  There facing me was an image I recognized from the many pictures I already have like it. It ended up going to another area of another image in the sky.  The pictures were taken anywhere between 2-12 seconds apart, as in some I had to swivel the tripod head to find it again. The lights within it change position but that too is like other images of that same type I have., Sometimes the line formations are red…green…white…orange..and even blue. Sometimes double ,often single.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We have not been able to look at all of the photos submitted by this witness, but the several we have viewed look to us to be aircraft, or other normal objects.  We have not seen yet what we consider to be a genuine UFO.  PD))<n>

It appeared to be ~1000-2000 ft in altitude, though that is pure speculation--it was about 3-4in in length from where I was sitting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As it approached I noticed that it was a continuous shape with no discreet elements.  The point of the V was forward and the tails were moving in somewhat of a ribbon-fashion.  At one point the tails angled sharply inward to form an almost complete outline of a triangle.  As it passed into the north the whole length began curling around and overlapping, somewhat like a treble clef.  It was noiseless and was not accelerating.<n>

The UFO had a chevron shape, much like a USAF B-2 bomber but was much larger.  It had a grey metallic/ charcoal color with a series of three white lights, one in the center and two on the “wing” tips. It made no noise.  Had the craft been an aircraft, military or commercial it would have made some sound but I could hear nothing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This sighting occurred in a secured, non-military, government regulated highly sensitive area.  I am an employee in this such area.  As the UFO appeared to me in between two large structures I viewed it while driving by along a road.  By the time I stopped the vehicle and reversed to take a second look the UFO had vanished with no trace or sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I attempted to debunk the sighting by looking around the area to see if it could have been! a light stanchion, large crane or some other object but my search came up empty. No physical structures existed in LOS or in the adjacent area to the UFO. I have not seen the UFO since.<n>

They were blinking red, white, and blue.  They seemed to be wiggling around and they constantly changed colors. One started out calmly blinking then got rapid and bright.  The other was blinking and flashing brighter than any star I&#39;ve ever seen. One of the &#34;stars&#34; got dim and disappeared out of sight.  As soon as I told the other witness that it had gone away...  It reappeared in its spot with just as much intensity as before.<n>

I first noticed it from the upper left of my front windshield.  It was very bright and white like that of a L.E.D. light but a lot stronger it was about 50-100 feet above us it lit up the road and the car in front of us, then all of a sudden the light was gone and it flew into the canyon, as it was flying off I followed it with my eyes it was the shape of a plate round and for the most part flat. I could only see the shadow of it.  At the same time it had flown off into the canyon the car in front of me sped off really quickly.  My girlfriend at the time saw the light she did not see the object as she states, &#34;I was too afraid to look at it&#34; she at first thought it was a bird or a helicopter, I do not believe ! it was a bird or helicopter as it made no noise whatsoever. My stomach dropped and my heart raced as soon as I saw it.  I know it was a UFO I have seen videos and pictures online since I was young and this is what it was.  The car in front of me unfortunately did not slow down or anything I wish we could have discussed what that was with the individual in that car.<n>

This lighted object moves erratically in every direction sometimes in a straight line other times rather pendulously, appears to sit relatively still then will dart or make slight movements.  Initially thought it was an airplane as we are near an international airport as well as 2 Air Force Bases and a Navy Base.  It can be obscured by clouds so it does not appear to be reflective such as a laser light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As we were looking at the lighted object 2 other people from the community walked by.  I asked if they would look at the light in the sky and tell me what they observe, they described exactly what we had.  It is currently 11:47 p.m. and the sky is becoming hazy but the object continues its behavior.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My daughter has observed a similar appearance more than once.  One time she observed 2 objects very near one another.<n>

I always look at the stars when I do.  This night I was especially excited cause reports said I may be able to see the aurora borealis due to recent high solar activity.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As soon as I came out I was upset as the sky was completely clouded over.  Couldn&#39;t even see a single star.  While looking around i looked northeast in to the sky, and I saw what appeared to be a plane.  As I began to look closer I noticed that it didn&#39;t look like any plane I had ever seen.  It had 3 lights in a triangular formation, all white.  And in the center had a small white light that seemed to be projecting different colors out of it a bit, reds, blues, greens, yellows.  It kept on changing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Now the weirdest part about it that makes me know it wasn&#39;t an airplane, it looked as if it was only about less than a mile away. It was extremely close, but it was moving extremely slow.  It was barely moving at all.  It took it a full 2 minutes at least to travel what seemed to be me 2000 feet.  It was heading my direction, almost straight at me(heading southwest).<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then out of nowhere it spontaneously changed direction and began to head north and higher up into the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About 20 seconds after it changed direction, it just vanished.  I haven&#39;t really been sure what to make of it since.  I thought maybe a helicopter, but this vehicle had no sound whatsoever, if it were a plane or helicopter it was close enough that I most definitely would have heard it.  I don&#39;t own a camera so couldn&#39;t take any photos or anything.  Was thinking of asking neighbors if they had seen anything but didn&#39;t in fear of them thinking i&#39;m a nutcase.  Also I did not see any other planes in the sky that night.  I stayed outside for about 10 more minutes hoping it might come back but unfortunately it did not.<n>

I had just made a right turn onto route  340.  when I looked into the sky i noticed what looked like an airplane in flight.  The blinking tail light had me thinking that it was an airplane anyway.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I was driving I glanced up at the sky for a second time and noticed that the same flying oject that was moving to the right was now moving to the left.  i slowed down driving to pay a little more attention.  the next few seconds when i looked the object was very close and pretty bright.  It went from having one blinking tail light to a bright light.  It then had another line of light connect and another bright light and the another line and once again a bright light.  Totalling three lights in a line all connecting.  So strange I thought and stopped my car in the middle of the road.  I took a picture of the object with three lights and saved it to my phone.  I hit the end button on my phone and was getting ready to hit the gas i saw something incredible.  The middle light went out on the object and two other lights turned on.  They formed a diamond shape that was a little stretched.  They were very bright and close by.  They were all connected and under the lights were l! ike dashes of orange lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I grabbed my phone to take another picture of the whole object.  I held it up to get a good shot.  I saw the object in my camera and also when i just looked.  As i was taking the picture the object dissappeared.  It was like poof,  to a cloud of smoke and with one last bright flash it was gone.  I then proceeded to drive along 340 looking for it to come back again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I called my sister and soon after arrived at her house.

However, as the craft rose and flew closer it was extremely bright like a huge flying fireball..dark orange/reddish color but bright like fire.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The craft flew directly over us (meaning my wife who I called out to &#34;come see this..hurry hurry&#34; and made no sound whatsoever.

We both watched as it simply disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I do not take drugs and was not drinking... this was very real and nothing we have ever seen before.  We made a 911 report.  I&#39;m really hoping someone else saw the event.  It also appeared that a search of the area was made by helicoptor and small plans circling after the event.   Not for sure but was out of the norm.<n>

My 3 year old couldn’t sleep, I was showing him what the Statue of Liberty was.  We were looking at Presidential Dollars and he asked if the picture on the reverse was god, I said no, and tried to explain what it was.  Then it hit me I could show him a picture. After a couple links I stumbled on http://www.earthcam.com/usa/newyork/statueofliberty/?cam=liberty_torch I found it amazing that you can view NY through a live feed from Liberty’s Torch.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After I started panning around at aprox 11:15 pm I noticed a floating light above the city.  I had caught it while it was on the left hand side of the panoramic view.  The light was white, solid &amp; rectangular the length of the light iliminated any possibility of an air craft.  I’ve never seen anything in that shape so clear and uniform. I had to capture what I was seeing and remembered that I downloaded a plugin where you can capture screen shots.  I’d yet to use it but thought this would be the perfect time. My first attempt at taking the screen capture got screwed up from lack of use.  And bye the time I made it back to the web site and back to the live feed looking out the torch into NY.  The light had moved a considerable distance, and now was three ¼’s across the panoramic screen and much further away.  Now its 11:20pm but this time I was able to capture the light with a screen capture.   You can still make out the odd shape of the light and still have a pretty good view ! when zooming in.<n> <n><n> <n><n> But the next thing I saw is really amazing! When looking directly at the Statue of Liberty in full frontal view.  A long object can easily be seen with multiple color lights just off the right side of Lady Liberty and extending all the way out of the shot.  The placement of the object can’t be horizon lights or anything like that.  And I just checked the live cameras during the day to double check, and nothing is visible.  And the great thing is I was able to take two pictures of the object. If I was to guess what I was looking at I’d say it was a large oval but flattened shaped fly saucer and I was seeing the side that  was closest to me, and when you zoom in on the picture it does appear to confirm these thoughts.  I’ve got multiple pictures that allow you to zoom in and can send them to whom ever, I hope they come out right when I post this.<n>

I saw one bright orb moving west pretty fast, then I noticed it was one of three in a triangle pattern flying at same speed/ same distance apart. I kept looking up and saw more of these lights. Some came in pairs of two&#39;s and a couple more times in a triangle pattern.  Maintained the same speed and kept the same distance apart, also they all moved east to west.  No blinking lights on any of these, no signs of being planes.  I have lived near Midway airport all my life and I know how to distinguish planes.  I was just stuck watching as waves kept coming.  I went up to get my cell phone but the lights were to far to show up on my cell phone camera. I told my mom to come and check them out as we were watching more pairs pass my father came home from work and joined us.  He grabbed his binoculars and saw just a! solid color some were green some were orange.  This went on for at least 15-20 min before the cloud cover became to much, but through the patches and breaks in the clouds I saw at least 13-15 of these balls.  Im not sure what they were but me and my family were just awed by how many kept coming and the frequency.  I know this was the night the big solar flare was suppose to hit us, not sure if this could have anything at all to do with this event.<n>

After finishing my crunches I laid there on the road and I looked at the sky then looked behind me and to my right and saw a green fiery ball coming down almost looking like it landed in my neighbors yard.  We tried to get close and see if it landed but his whole yard is fenced and I couldn’t see in the back yard.  I first thought it was a shooting star but there’s no way, it was WAY to close.  It almost looked like fireworks but there are no kids in my neighborhood and especially not in the house that it landed behind.  We couldn’t even hear people talking. It was dead silent.  This is the 2nd time I’ve witnessed this green fiery ball but never this close.  The first time was in my girlfriend’s neighborhood in Acworth, GA but it was a lot further in the sky, but again you could tell it was NOT a shooting star, and it was definitely not fireworks because of the length and size of it.  Not to mention it was GREEN and it was FAST.<n>

It was extremely bright and flew on a straight course, but faster than the plane.  It looked smaller than the plane and shined a bright white, possibly reflected sunlight off a metallic surface.  It also looked as if it left a small, almost see-through trail that was gone in seconds.  It broke my line of sight when it passed in front of a cloud.  I waited for it to come out the other side, but it never did.  After about five minutes I stopped looking for it.<n>

Given the altitude, it seemed too bright and too wide to be the beam of (for instance) the light on a police helicopter.  Furthermore, a couple of the lights turned very quickly at right angles and did not &#34;sweep&#34; in the way a searchlight would have moved.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The best way that I can describe the &#39;shape&#39; of the light is to ask you to picture a comet.  There&#39;s the head of the comet and then the tail that gradually fades out. These bursts of light were like that, only they were in reverse of the direction that a comet would go.  In other words, if traveling west, the tail would come first and then the brightness would race ahead and then just black out.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I can&#39;t guess the distance that they moved over, but from the plane window, I would say it covered a good 6 inches, so on the ground, that would have been pretty far, maybe a mile??  The lights were bright white.  Again, a couple of the lights turned in different directions, but the majority of them just went straight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There weren&#39;t a lot of people on the plane and I didn&#39;t hear folks talking about it as they got off in ABQ.  I did go up and talk to the pilot before the new passengers boarded for the rest of the flight to Tucson, but he didn’t see anything because he was focused on the approach to the airport.  He suggested it might have been some military exercises, but since it was over a populated area,  I discount that theory.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Whatever it was, was very interesting and certainly unforgettable!<n>

It was not fully dark yet but their light was very strong. They were in the western sky at this point, one above the other, the higher one a bit to the left of the lower one. We concluded they must be planets or something because it was unusual to see such bright stars or lights of any sort in that part of the sky that we&#39;d noticed before.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Two hours later we were back outside and they were both still in the exact same location. We invited a third friend with us to look and tell us if he knew anything about planets that were supposed to be in view (turns out that night there were, however, in the south/southeastern sky and near where the moon rose, which we found very quickly later, while the other two lights remained). Anyhow, while watching them, suddenly one of them got extremely bright and then suddenly disappeared. It reappeared once again very strongly about 10 seconds later and then the other one did the same.  We decided that was really odd and decided to keep watching from an upstairs room when we got in.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This time the lights continued to take turns suddenly blinking out but we notice they starting doing each for longer and varied periods of time. They also shifted south quite quickly within a 20 minute period @ 21:45 but remained in the same position in relation to each other. Then they stayed in the same part of the sky for possibly 3 more hours (that we know of, but took at least an hour off from watching as it wasn&#39;t too spectacular and we were sure there was a rational and common explanation likely). We went back outside later to check on them when a friend was leaving, and the bottom one had grown brighter than ever and the top one was more faint but dimming and lighting up alternately every 3-5 seconds now. Quite rapidly. The other was staying lit solidly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Just when we decided it was sort of creepy and yet sort of availing nothing to keep staring at these lights, trying to figure them out, a third new one, quite bright, appeared high above both, where we had noticed no star or light of any sort before. No other star in the sky was as bright as these either. It did the same thing... Disappearing and reappearing suddenly, each spell lasting 15-30 seconds. It never moved like a plane or any sort of flying vehicle I know of, it hovered there for as long as we watched. We began to feel a little creeped out and went back inside. I checked before going to sleep and by then only the bottom light of the original two remained at first and then finally disappeared completely.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;ve been trying to figure out what these could be since, and can&#39;t seem to come up with anything that fully works. I don&#39;t like the idea of unknown objects hovering around my city for hours on end blinking at us lol...<n> <n><n> <n><n> I looked for them last night and tonight as well but there was a lot of cloud cover or else they weren&#39;t there, seeing as I think they would be bright enough to shine thru some of the thin clouds that moved by at times.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((ADDENDUM FROM ANONYMOUS SOURCE))<n> <n><n> <n><n> Followup to the blinking stars report.... they are planets.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Hi.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I sent a report in the other day about two &#39;stars&#39; that were blinking on and off.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I did a bit more research and it turns out they do fit the description for Venus and Jupiter right now, as far as where they should be and position in relation to one another, etc.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I still don&#39;t understand why they were disappearing and reappearing the way they were, and as for the shift to the south....we could have been confused, we were walking outside on a few different occasions during the course of the night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I don&#39;t know what the third blinking object was. But if two planets can do it, than probably another shiny thing in the sky can do it for a simple reason as well.<n> <n><n> <n><n> But the first/main two that we noticed at sundown had the right timing and position, and everything. It is unlikely they were anything else but the two planets that are showing off this month :)  I would prefer my report was not posted or made available, if possible. I just feel silly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> If you have any idea why these planets could &#34;blink&#34; on and off the way they were, I would love to know. I&#39;m not having much luck with google...haha Maybe tiny clouds are enough to cause the effect. Maybe atmospheric phenomena...of some sort...<n> <n><n> <n><n> However, whatever the case, I&#39;m about 99.9% sure they were Venus and Jupiter. If you have the time to write, and any ideas why they could blink out like that, I&#39;d be interested to hear just out of curiosity, but if you guys are busy don&#39;t worry about it. I will leave my email this time just in case. :)  I have had two sightings of very strange flying objects in the past,  while living further north-west, but haven&#39;t seen anything for a long time. Now I&#39;m around different people, some who have heard my stories, but aren&#39;t particularly interested in considering them possible lol.... maybe I got overexcited and was hoping I could say &#34;see, there IS weird stuff going on up there! and YOU saw it this time&#34; lol....<n> <n><n> <n><n> Needless to say, it was my idea to report, not my friends&#39;.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous.

The object was still there and he agreed that it was not a plane, star nor a tower.  We proceeded down the road to try to get closer and, unfortunately, lost sight of it for just a few seconds due to trees in our line of sight.  As soon as we returned to high enough ground to spot it again, it was gone!

It was bright white and left a long whitish-green streak of light or vapor behind it which dissipated about 10 minutes later.  I didn&#39;t see or hear any explosion, I also could not tell where it landed because of how dark it was outside.

At first I thought it was a shooting star but it was way to big and I’ve seen shooting star before,  I could feel my heart pounding and knew right away it was more then that..<n>

Later, the lights start dimming and then off, bright dimming and off.  We stop at the rest area and the lights gain speed towards the horizont/sky.  One kept straight and the otherone went  to the right.  Never saw something like this before.  Cant tell shape or size.  Just too brig.ht and too low compare with the stars.<n>

As it decended through the moonlight clouds it fascinated me with it&#39;s speed color and beauty.I couldn&#39;t take my eyes off of it! I jumped up from the couch and flew through the back door to see if it was going to hit the ground, and that&#39;s when it stopped above the neighbor&#39;s tree line hovered a moment, then went to the left above the treeline of my neighbors...Completely silent.

It took place to the right side of us, way up in the sky, over the park trees. It lasted for about 4 seconds.  The flash of light apeared out of no where, zoomed through the sky &amp; disappeared completely. It didn&#39;t keep going like a plane or shooting star would, that&#39;s why we came to the conclusion that it must of been a UFO.<n>

Coming home from paying this month&#39;s rent, I noticed something silver and shimmering in the sky.  This object caught the sunlight in an amazing fashion. Off in the distance I strained my eyes to make out what it was.  My friend was driving at the time so I had to point it out to them.  We speculated as to what it could be as we drove closer and closer.  It didn&#39;t move unless we broke eye contact, so we eliminated the possibility of a far off jet or plane. It wasn&#39;t whirling so we eliminated helicopters.  These are the usual air crafts the run traffic above Davenport.  I leaned forward in the passenger seat still trying to figure out what it could be as we came directly underneath it.  Fourteen to fifteen stories up, an oval shaped object hung there, motionless.  I judged it to be about the size of a four-door vehicle.  I struggled to make out some detail, but it was unusually blurry, as if on purpose.  The blue sky seemed to show through these holes running along the frame of the object.  As we passed below it I hopped over the middle seats and got to the back to try and catch another glimpse, but it was gone.  I could not identify the object, so to me, it was a UFO.  I apologize for not having any evidence of this experience.  My deepest regret was that I had my cellphone in hand and was too busy trying to figure out what it was to take a picture.<n>

Each of the lights were ringed with what looked like exhaust grills - they resembled what a jet engine turbine looks like when not running. It move silently at about the speed of a commercial jet - first thought was not alian UFO but some new aircraft.

I had set down at my dinner table to eat when i heard a low resonating freqency outside my dinning room window.  My wife had emerged from the bedroom and i asked her to open the door and look out to see if she could see the source of this sound.  She stepped out our apartment onto the patio and yelled at me to come quickley.  When i joined her we observed an object moving northwest across the sky.  The object was apparently circular because the lights were rotating counterclockwise around the object.  The color of the lights were blue and white in color.No other colors were observed.  The sighting duration was about two minutes.  The object flew into the northwestern sky and dissapeared.  One other thing i forgot to mention is when my wife grabbed the front door to open it she recieved an electrical shock!!  This information now concludes this report.<n>

I have served in the US. Coast Guard.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My elevation is 3500 feet above sea level in the Sierra Nevada.  I was sitting on my deck facing west, when I noticed an unidentifiable object coming in my direction from the northwest.  10:00 position from the north.  It seemed large in comparison to the houses on the ridge so that ruled out balloons.  When I first saw it the approximate size was ¼ size of the moon and appeared to be tumbling, floating slowly and ascending  as it came my direction (south east).  It was white in color, and had a primary form of what appeared to be square, but that was not the complete form.  It was unexplainable.  As it tumbled and floated closer, the shape would change and was getting smaller as it approached.  It was very silent, and did not disrupt dogs in the neighborhood.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I watched for at least 5 minutes trying to figure out what it was, because the shape was so odd.  I then went into the house to get my iphone. When I came back outside it was still coming in my direction but much smaller and higher.  The sun was very bright, which made it impossible to see if I was positioned on the object when I snapped the pictures.  It stopped moving south easterly as it was  slightly over my house and sat in one position for 15 minutes.  I called the National Reporting Agency, and while on the telephone with them, it then began to ascend higher until it disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Pictures attached taken with iphone (had already began to ascend and was ¼ the size that it was when it was a over 1-2 miles away and lower)  1056 below the jet slightly to the left (without zoom on the telephone) 1057- 1059 with zoom 1060-1061 – object sat stationary in this position for 5 minutes but still ascending before moving slightly to the south. Use tree for perspective. Object is center left.

They were silently moving from east to west very smoothly.  The weren’t in any type of formation- a few here, one here, another couple here and so on.  They flew over head at approximately 1500-ft ( just a guess)  traveling at  maybe 100mph.  They were slow enough I could find them in my cameras view finder and track them.

March 3, 2012<n> <n><n> <n><n> Seen in Western Sky or WNW sky over Sacramento, California on March 3d, 2012 at approximately 8:42 PM for about 10 minutes by two people (Husband age 63 and wife, slightly younger)  Appeared as a blue light in the sky that seemed more purple/blue to the husband, more blue to wife.  Have pics. Some red was see by husband and wife but only a little and a little white light seen by wife who has better eyesight.  No lights were flashing. Appeared to be moving fairly low in sky, not flashing and fading in and almost out.  There MAY have been another fainter, light color light in sky with blue light. hard to say.  Cam shows a light but it is possible it was a low in the sky planet or star (shown in one pic)   Viewed from Dealynn St. address just South of Hurley in general direction of Sacramento Metro Airport. No air traffic appeared from this direction although it is a common a busy route for large, commercial aircraft coming from Metro Airport.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Photos were taken with a Sanyo E1090 digital camera on a night setting using full telephoto (which is both optical and electronic with a 3X optical zoom. Camera set at 12 megapixels. The pic don&#39;t seem to capture the almost UV (filtered I guess, purple quality of the light which just seem only blue to wife) Husband wears glasses for nearsightedness. 14 photos taken, a few showed nothing, some showed bright blue wavy lines (as if camera was unsteady and &#34;took it&#39;s time to record image) Partial moon nearly directly over head approx. 10 min after observation.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was one or more helicopters in sky shortly after seeing light, seemingly unrelated and most likely police helicopter () One was using bright lamp to illuminate ground. Helicopter lights were traffic light green, white, and red with flashing with noise. Copter was orbiting to south of residence and later one or same north, possibly going to another site or back to base.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Male observer sees a lot of air traffic from location, mostly large airliners coming toward residence from Metro Airport and somewhat to North. The other common air traffic sources are police and possible traffic helicopters which are very common in area. Small airplanes not common in this area. Facing East at this location (front of building, there is some air traffic from a different airport to the North. Often large Coast Guard aircraft and some corporate aircraft. (Large former airbase is to North)  The blue color of the light is what stood out mostly as well as fact that it seemed to linger.<n>

I was inside my house at the time, sitting on the sofa, when I saw the object fly across the overcast sky.  I ran outside to look toward the direction it was flying in, but I did not see it due to houses and trees.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I came back inside, ran upstairs to see if I could get a better look above the tree line.  I spotted the object and it appeared to be bouncing (going up and down and back and forth) above the mature trees.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was moving quite fast, going above and at times, below the tree line.  It was a bright blue luminous oval object with a smaller red oval attached to the left side of the blue object.  The lights were not flashing or pulsing, but very bright and steady.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I called my mother over to the window and we both watched the object for approximately 5 minutes.  I ran to get my camera and snapped two pictures through the upstairs bedroom window, one where the object is in the picture and the other as it was leaving the frame.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After another couple of minutes, it disappeared below the tree line, and did not re-appear again.

At first, they appeared to be another flock of some kind of fowl, until we realized how slowly they were moving.  There were ten of them, and they were small, white dots, and, from what I saw through a pair of binoculars, appeared to look slightly like deformed bowling pins.  Over 20-30 minutes, they slowly made their way through the sky for about four or five hundred yards and then stopped directly over our house.  Then they hovered there soundlessly (the noisy geese were long gone), and the ten of them would move slowly into differnt formations, mostly triangles.  They did this for about ten minutes, and then slowly seemed to drift upwards until disappearing into the sky.<n>

I opened my window to see if they were helicopters, but there was absolutely no sound.  They kind of floated around—they definitely were not comets or satellites.   Ibasically watched them for a couple minutes, transfixed.  They flew up and over my apartment so I couldn’t see them anymore.  I thought about going outside to follow them, but I was a little freaked out.  Last time I saw a strange light in the sky was about fifteen years ago.  That time it was three orbs flying in a perfect equilateral triangle, then flying around separately.  I really don’t have any idea what these two asterisk shaped lights were doing or what they were.  Wondering if anyone else saw them.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Either just east or west of I-101, I looked out my driver&#39;s side window (which was closed at the time) and spotted 2 amber/red cylinders floating above the 15ft+ barrier wall that aligned outer edge of east-bound lanes.  I opened my window to get a better look while I slowly began to pass them.  They looked like small (~2 ft diameter) Chinese lanterns. Light emitted from an orb-like mass in the middle of each lantern; the outter cylinder-shaped body seemed to be lit by this orb. I could tell neither the orbs nor the lanterns were made-up of no ordinary light because they were radiant yet soft, dense hi-def but misty. Hard to explain.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They gently floated along and shifted positions (in relation to each other). Then I saw one lantern float into the other, merging into 1 cylinder (which maintained its  size). I continued to keep my eye on them/it (and the road...) but eventually the rubbernecking reached an uncomfortable angle. I turned off at the next exit and flipped around, but they/it were/was gone. The reason why I&#39;m not sure if they were amber or red is because I remember them being both of those colors (together, i.e. they matched) yet I have no recollection of noticing them change; one second they were amber and the next they were red, and I have no idea how they pulled off that fast one. They were pretty. Seemed to have an air of intelligence about them. Just got that kind of vibe.<n>

I hadn&#39;t been paying attention, but when I looked - we all (two other people besides myself) saw several red lights that were coming from the ground going to the sky. Did not see them leave the ground because we were approximately 5 miles away and the tree&#39;s were blocking the ground.  Looked like it could have been coming from the old Airforce Base off of Raspberry Road. First, three came up and went to the sky then four, then one, then two (not in that order) probably 12 - 20 in all.  I don&#39;t know - but, there&#39;s probably some sort of rational explaination. I would not say that I believe in extraterrestial UFO&#39;s nor would I say I don&#39;t believe, there&#39;s just no proof.  So, right now - I just saw some unidentified flying objects.  I&#39;m just curious if anyone else in Anchorage saw the lights and can say what they were.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Last night in Hagerstown, Indiana around 10:27 three friends and I saw an object in the sky that had to be over 300 feet long. I asked what are those lights, and my buddy said its the water tower.  I said water towers don&#39;t move. I was at the top of the hill in our town, and sped up to get a better look. We went under the town bridge an stopped the car. We rolled down windows and turned flashers on. We turned car off and continued to look out window. It was so big it looked like a a passenger plane but was only 50ft above the tree tops. There was no noise at all, only a large light in the front and some red lights in back an we could barley see the middle. There was something that was in middle that looked like circles but cant say to be for sure. It was moving at a high speed, and by the time we had a phones out, it wouldn&#39;t pick up.  We watched it keep going and it kinda turned and then it was gone. We sat in car freaking out. I dropped off frien! ds and went home and told my father. I looked on computer to try to find the FAA number but it wasn&#39;t there, due to prank calls and probably they wouldn&#39;t give out info like that to a normal person.  I have school so after school kept trying to find a number. One of my buddy&#39;s believe in them and told me about the sight. I called number and found out about this report.  I was told I should have reported to news, police, or anything but I wanted this to be official and not have the paper hang up on me or police about prank calls. We know Moorland, Indiana test fighter planes around our area, but there is no planes around this area that are that big or that low around here.

I just plugged in &#34;fireballs in sky over Stuart&#34; in my search box to see if there was anything on the news about what I had just seen. I wondered if people sky dive at night and use flares to land. The glow that I saw was too big and pulsating to be that. It didn&#39;t have any nav lights, the red and green lights on the wing tips of a plane. I didn&#39;t see any particular formation. The lights followed each other with a good deal of separation. When &#34;shooting stars&#34; fizzle out they would seem to be traveling a lot faster than these strange orbs, and would have fizzled out before I lost sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

As I watched from my house &amp; then the craft started coming closer to my house (in Dormont).  I believe it was triangled shape, flew over &amp; then turned &amp; flew around.  It did have white, blue and red lights on it.  Then in the distance again high in the sky I seen another very bright light larger than a star which I believe could have been another craft.  Never in my 58 years have I seen anything like this.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.  PD))<n>

I heard a vague sound which gradually increased in intensity over a few minutes.  It sounded something like a propeller-driven aircraft, but increased in intensity to become much louder and lower pitch than any aircraft sound I had heard before.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I looked up to try to locate the source of the sound, and noticed three red lights, like the typical wing lights on the left wings of aircraft, moving from my right to my left, toward the south.  They appeared to be about 2000 feet above ground level, and moving very slowly.  Then I noticed they were all in exact linear alignment, equally spaced, and moving as one unit.  Then I noticed there were no other lights, green, white, etc., visible, and that the stars were blacked out in the entire area between the lights and slightly above the line they created.  Immediately below the line of the lights, stars were visible, but not immediately above, so that is apparently where the body of the craft was, but it was completely invisible, appearing non-descript opaque black.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The craft continued moving from north to south, moving very slowly, what would normally be too slow to maintain altitude, and eventually disappeared into the south, toward the city of Phoenix.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I would be very interested to know if anyone has any idea what this was.  The length of the craft appeared to be about 1 to 2 miles.  Not the typical size of normal aircraft, and no blinking wing lights.  The three red lights were constant.  And it was certainly not silent, and I thought UFO’s were usually silent.  So I have no idea what it was.  But there is no doubt it was there, this was not a vague or distant sighting.  I have been a private researcher for the last 40 years in the health field, and am qualified as an observer to be as objective as possible.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Any input would be appreciated.<n>

The sound continued for a few minutes.  I was at my desk with my back to the east window, and my back began to feel the vibrations of the hum.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My daughter, also alone in her room at her desk, heard the same thing and asked me about it.  She thought it sounded like a synthesizer.  I wondered if my other daughter was downstairs using the cake mixer, but, in the past, the cake mixer never sounded like that, nor did the sound carry upstairs.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We decided to get our video recorder and go outside.  That is when we saw a red flashing light.  It flashed like a strobe light.  I knew it wasn&#39;t a helicopter or a small airplane, nor a commercial jet.  Each time the red light flashed, red and orange lights beneath the object rotated in strobe-like fashion.  The only sound was a very deep hum.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It continued at a north at a normal speed.  For some time we could hear the hum.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I drew the craft immediately once we returned inside.  What I drew looks more like a flying saucer.<n>

It started as I was getting my children up for school, early in the morning before the sun rises. I am a smoker, but we do not smoke in the house. I was looking up at the stars, watching them, when out of the corner of my eye,a bright one suddenly began to move across the sky. It was small, and it looked like a regular bright star, but the way it moved gave me shivers of fear. It didn&#39;t blink, It wasn&#39;t a shooting star moving as fast as they move. Every other plane we see in the sky blinks multiple colors of white, red and blue or a combination, or just red. This one did not. This one seemed to mimic a star, then it just... left.It was extremely high, but I still do not know what it was.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I told my wife, she laughed, saying it was probably a shooting star. But it was not, I have seen plenty of those. I challenged her the next few days to get up with me and star-gaze, in prayer to see it again. A few days afterward we saw many planes in the sky, skywriters, jets, passenger airplanes, military cargo jets. And my wife gave up saying she believed me, it was a u.f.o., an object I could not identify. Depressed, I woke up every morning with my girls for school, between 6:00 a.m. and 6:30 am, watching the sky until they went to school. Then finally I saw the object again. I believe it was on a Wednesday or a Thursday morning. The dawn was rising, but the stars  still shined through some light cloud in the sky. I fixated my eyes on one, watching the clouds move in front of it, and I watched it leave its position in the sky. Almost like a night watchman. Excitedly I opened the door behind me and screamed at the children to get over here and look, but only my oldest ! daughter made it out, but the object had vanished in plain sight. They had just missed it, but she said that she believed me and left for school.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I told my wife, and she of course said o.k., but I could see the disbelief in her eyes. Convinced I was not crazy, and determined because I saw the object again, I cannot stop watching the skies. About three weeks ago, my wife and I was smoking in the front yard, and I was watching towards Orion&#39;s Belt, when from my position to the right I was watching a cluster of stars. My wife noticed how pretty and bright they were as well, when we Both witnessed the object in the cluster move right, faster than usual, then grow extremely bright and vanish. I screamed at her &#34;Told you so!&#34; She was shocked by what she saw, and she could not explain what she seen, but she left it at, &#34;That is amazing, you should see if anyone else ever see&#39;s this.&#34; Since then, about a week and a half ago, I had the family in my truck and we have a sunroof, we went to dinner at a local buffet, and as we were driving back to our neighborhood, the stars were gorgeous yet again. I laughed and told them I want to see  &#34;the star that moves again&#34; and they all said we want to see it too. I pulled into my driveway, and my wife and I and all the children sat looking out at the sky, when directly above us, it did it again. I screamed out there it is, and the children rushed out as well as my wife. It moved across other stars, to the left and in the direction of the ocean. Bright, fast, but not a falling star and not blinking one bit. The children were excited to see what I was talking about, and my wife said, &#34;That is cool, but the last time was cooler.&#34; I have moved as of a week ago, but I still find myself watching for stars that just... leave their nightly position in space. What is this object, and does anyone else see it in South Carolina?<n>

Living near an Air Force Base and local airport I have observed many different variations of aircraft, close enough to Cape Canaveral to witness launches of all kinds and have not ever noticed such a strange occurrence before.  I was standing just inside my screened in porch and stepped outside immediately.  It was very bright - very reddish/orange and very large.  It disappeared within 30 seconds roughly.  Not a meteor and night sky was as it should be.  It ALMOST looked like a burning plane but just stopped!<n>

This is the second time I have seen it.  The first time was about a month ago and it was directly in fron of me.  It wa alot closer to the ground, as I aproached it turned its lights out and as I was searching for it, I seen a shadow of it in the dark like it just glided on its side and thats when I seen it was a circular shape.  It flew lightspeed in the air.  I got 2 pictures of it but I was driving and they r not that great.  I seen it again this morning like I said and it scared me.  I couldn&#39;t hardley pullout of my drive way.  By the time I got to my phone because I wanted to camcord it, it was gone.  I am very scared. I don&#39;t know if they are here for a natural resource, if its the goernment.  Please take this seriously, I am a mother  of four kids and take care of my grandson, I don&#39;t know what they want. If they will cause harm.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The trouble call was that the two tracks had a short for several miles. This was unusual because to do this it would cause four circuits to go bad at the same time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Each circuit running through the track has its own back up batteries and it is unheard of for all four to short at same time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I got on the track with my high rail truck and headed west  inspecting the track as I went.  About half way I noticed a flash of light coming at me at a high speed.  At first I thought meteor.  It startled me and I slammed on my brakes.  By the time I stopped  a blue light hovered about 20 ft away from the front of my truck.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I tried to back up and it shot to the rear of my truck forcing me to stop and go forward again.  It  then shot in front of my truck again. I stopped again  the craft then hovered around my truck making  quick moves right to left.  This lasted several minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I finally got my wits back and  took several pictures with my cell phone.  Shortly after I started taking pictures it shot off to the south at high speed and was gone.  I have the ability to monitor the shorts on the track with my laptop in real time.  Within minutes of the craft leaving the shorts went away.  I cleared the trouble ticket  as problem cleared on its own.  Later I told my supervisor and manager and showed them the pictures.<n>
