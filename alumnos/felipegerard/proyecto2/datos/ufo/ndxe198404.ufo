I WAS ABOUT 13 OR IF IT OCCURED IN FALL I WOULD HAVE  BEEN 14 YEARS OLD, WHEN AT APPOX 5:30 AM IN AUBURN, NY ON SEYMOUR ST, I WAS DELIVERING THE MORNING NEWSPAPERS.  IT WAS STILL DARK.  AS I WAS WALKING UP THE SIDEWALK, I HAD THE STRANGE SENSASTION AS IF I WAS BEING WATCHED, SO I LOOKED UP, AND I SAW THIS HUGE TRIANGLE SHAPED OBJECT HOVERING OVER THE HOUSE TOP ROOFS, IT WAS SO LOW, THAT I SWORE I COULD TOUCH IT, THEIR WAS NO SOUND AT ALL.  I REMEMBER STOPPING TO STARE AT IT FOR ABOUT 10 SECONDS I WATCHED IT.  I SAW A RED PULSATING LIGHT IN THE CORNER, AND VERY INTRICATE PIPING ON THE UNDERSIDE OF THE WING.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I KEPT THINKING THAT THIS IS NOT AN AIRPLANE, I WASN&#39;T SURE WHAT IT WAS.  I WAS JUST IN AWE, I LOOKED AWAY AND THEN LOOKED BACK AND IT WAS GONE. THEIR WAS NO TRACE OF IT ANYWHERE.<n> <n><n> <n><n> BUT HERE IS WHAT&#39;S WEIRD, BECAUSE, I NORMALLY FINISHED MY PAPER ROUYTE AT ABOUT 7:00 AM , SO THAT I COULD GO HOME AND GET READY FOR SCHOOL, TO CATCH THE BUS, HOWEVER THAT MORNING I WAS 30 MINUTES LATE, AND I REMEMBER RUNNING, AND NOT BEING ABLE TO FIGURE OUT WHY I WAS SO LATE, AS I WAS APPROACHING THE STREET TO HEAD HOME I LOOKED OFF INTO THE EASTERN SKY AND I SAW A HUGE GLOWING ORANGE SUN, LIKE NO SUN I HAVE EVER SEEN BEFORE, OR  HAVE EVER SEEN SINCE.  EVERYTHING ABOUT THAT MORNING HAS NEVER FELT NORMAL TO ME, WHENEVER I REMEMBER IT I ALWAYS WANT TO IMAGINE THAT I WAS IMAGINING IT, BUT I CAN&#39;T BECAUSE IT WAS SO REAL.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I RUSHED HOME TO TELL MY PARENT&#39;S WHAT HAD HAPPENED, AND THEY OF COURSE THEY DIDN&#39;T BELIEVE ME, THEY SAID I HAD AN OVERACTIVE IMAGINATION.<n> <n><n> <n><n> SO, THE REASON I AM WRITING 22 YEARS LATER IS BECAUSE, I RECENTLY WATCHED A PROGRAM ABOUT ALIEN ABDUCTIONS, IN WHICH THE VICTIMS HAD DESCRIBED THE SAME THING I WITNESSED, DURING THE SAME YEAR, AND CLOSE TO WHERE I WITNESSED THE SAME THING.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I THOUGHT ALL THESE YEARS THAT MAYBE I DID IMAGINE THIS THING, BUT NOW THAT I SEE SIMILIAR REPORTS I AM STARTING TO THINK IT REALLY DID HAPPEN.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))<n>

4/15/84 15:00|Elizabethtown (2-way highway en route to)|KY|Disk|My viewing lasted apprx.|While waiting for grandpa to return from gas station, I observed a circular craft with an elongated oval ring, emmitting small lights t|4/1/00|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/012/S12465.html|4|ndxe198404| While waiting for grandpa to return from gas station, I observed a circular craft with an elongated oval ring, emmitting small lights to the ground.  As one stream of twinkling lights fell to the ground, another stream of lights rose from the ground to the craft<n> <n><n> <n><n> Because the incident happened so long ago, and I was at such a young, I don&#39;t remember exactly where the event took place or on what date.  However, as I remember it, I was traveling on a 2-lane highway with my grandpa and older cousin.  While driving towards Elizabethtown KY my grandpa pulled off into a roadside gas station to pick up some snacks.  As he exited the van, I was sitting in the back seat reading a book.  Seconds after he entered the store my cousin who was sitting in the front seat (he was around 13 at the time?) began to yell and point frantically.  I climbed to the front seat to see what he was doing.  He was screaming &#34;Look, Look!&#34;  As I looked to the horizon across a corn field I saw a rather large object in the sky.  (As soon as I can draw a decent diagram, I will send it in.)  As I looked to the (East?) I saw a round, circular object in the sky that looked white in contrast with the sky.  Around the center of the object was an oblong oval shaped disc.  It looked like a big belt all the way around it.  Within the belt there were approximately four circles of light.  These circles were glowing red, green, and purple, and seemed to be alternating color schemes.  I would estimate that the object was around 200-250 yards away, and was located in the horizon where the corn field, and woods seemed to meet in the distance.  While watching the object, I remember being almost hypnotized by it; I had never seen anyting like it.  In fact at that time, I a positive that I did not know what an alien or a UFO was.  The craft just hovered the where the woods and corn met.  As it hovered it was emitting small twinkling lights down to the ground.  As one line of lights went to the ground, there was a second line of lights that traveled upwards into the craft. The whole time this was happening, my cousin was screaming and yelling.  After about a minute of observation, I snapped out of my fixation and asked him what it was.  He replied &#34;That&#39;s a UFO!  It has some aliens onboard who are probably going to kill off everyone and destroy the earth!&#34;  &#34;They are going to blow everyhting up!&#34;  Being 7-8 years old, I was pretty impressionable so naturally I believed him. As my grandfather came back to the van with food and drinks, I went to the back seat and cried, all the way to Elizabethtown where we were to visit my great-grandma.  My grandpa asked what was wrong with me but I didn&#39;t answer him.  Actually, I did not stop crying until the next morning when I realized that we were not all dead.  As I recall, my cousin and I did not talk to anyone until the next day.  I only bring this up because it really illustrates how absolutely terrified I was with the experience.  I thought for a while that my cousin was just trying to scare me, but he was genuiley terrified also. I am now 22 years old, and about to graduate from college with a degree in Law Enforcement.  To this day I have never seen any object even remotely close to this.  I haven&#39;t seen or talked to my cousin, who was present since I was around 10-11.  We had never talked about at all outside of the gas station parking lot.  Actually, I believe he is in prison now.  My grandpa does not remember my strange behaviors that day; but there are a lot of things that my grandpa does not remember. I am hoping that someone out there can validate this story, or have seen something similar.  I am very eager to talk to anyone about this, including investigators, or even go under hypnosis to possibly recount the incident in more detail.<n>

Hypn 5 yr later. Abduct, exam, unsettling.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was sole percipient, had insomnia one night, sat inside bedroom gazing at night sky approximately 0100 on 041584.  Saw a blazing white light enter field of vision from east, moving to west.  A dead pine tree served as a reference point.  Object halted behind the tree.  The motion of falling leaf was observed briefly.  Object stayed in sky throughout sighting.  Feeling some compulsion to go outside, I watched it from the back yard for what I thought was only a few minutes.  The weather was cool and I was not fully clothed, so felt cold.  I noticed the object seeming to drift slightly westward, still looking like bright blazing star.  Suddenly it moved about 90 degrees to the west, without transiting.  Tired, cold, I went in, sleepy finally, and went to bed.  Told someone the next day at work about it, got laughed at and forgot it for three years.  The book Communion was published, the cover startling me and triggering a memory of that night.  For two more years I thought about it often, reading Communion and some other things on UFOs.  In 1989 I had a hypnotic regression to the night in question, remembering in detail being taken up through the air to the object, taken aboard, examined, having communication with the occupants, including some joking and prophecy.  The object appeared to have a considerable amount of detail on both the outside and inside.  The occupants were short, gray-brown in color, and wearing red suits with black trim and some sort of smooth, tight-fitting head gear that seemed to cover a part ot their faces. They stood away from the table I was placed on, behind a half-wall.  A scanning device examined me.  I got a very good look at it such that I can see it as I write this.  There were several instances of the occupants joking with me to relax me and quell my fear.  There was an instance of forced physical paralysis with total loss of muscle control.  I kept my eyes closed during much of the experience.  At the end, two of them floated me back to the yard between them.  I was unable to look closely at them out of fear, and had a screen memory of their appearance.  The content was bizarre, odd, and frightening.  I left the hypnotherapy session very upset.  For several years subsequently I had a hard time with the memory.  The session was taped.  I transcribed the tape and studied it carefully.  There was an internal coherency but the content was very unusual.  Later, I read that the things that the occupants discussed (telepathically) were not so unusual in abductions.  I saw another clinician, a published author and psychiatrist who studies paranormal events.  Two more abductions were uncovered, going back to childhood.  Another emerged spontaneously.  One of them explained a mysterious short term leg paralysis that I had as a child.  Many pieces fell into place about bad memories from childhood, fear of windows at night, always looking into the night sky, and three previous sightings I had had.  Of those, one was multiple witnessed by parents and their friends.  No subsequent UFO activit! y occurred to me.  My sense of the occupants was that they were insincere, though trying to appear to be genuine and helpful.  I did not like what happened, feeling violated.  I was 36 years old at the time of the last event.  The others occured at 12, 8 and 4 years of age.  I am a trained, State licensed psychotherapist and a trained, State certified hypnotherapist, practicing now for thirty years.  I do not, nor have I ever, talked about the UFO encounters or my interest in them, nor is there any visual cue in my office that would tip off a patient that I would be amenable to a discussion of same.  Since the event and the hypnotic regression, a patient came to me who subsequently requested hypnotherapy and was surprised to reveal a tremendous amount of encounters going back to her age of four years.  Multiple family members were also involved, three of whom (two sisters and mother)I was able to interview and study hypnotically.  The mother had a conscious waking memory of her experience, which happened also when the daughter was four.  A sister only could remember the screen memory of a wolf&#39;s face at the window.  Another sister remembered from childhood a screen memory of white horses with large, black, glassy eyes staring at her inside her bedroom, then chasing her across the house.  These sessions went on with this patient for over one year, often meeting three times a week for two to three hour hypnotherapy sessions.  Finally, I had to steer it to a close, as I had become drained and emotionally upset by it.  The woman&#39;s children were also being abducted, all of whom I saw in the office and who talked about their experiences.  This experience, of treating this patient who was such an active percipient, was exhausting personally, although did serve to relieve the patient of significant disabling symptoms.  My sense of the occupants of her objects was that they were not benevolent.  Such was also the impression held by the patient.  I will be happy to send the transcript of my experience with any other material requested by mail.  No phone calls or email, please.<n>

We were all in our mid teens 15-16 just driving ages.  One of us had a bit of pot that was very fresh leaves from his plant he grew and couldn&#39;t wait for the plant to mature or for the stuff to dry, but we tried lighting it to no avail.  I remember because the subject of drugs came up when I reported this to police.  So we were not high on drugs, but trying!  We were parked facing the dump in the Pit right in the middle of probably 20 acres of dug out land used for fill around town.  So to get in this private property the entrance is a gravel 30 degree shear drop on both sides about 12 feet down into the pit.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Not bad enough to kill us but damage or flip if over we went.  Sitting parked trying to light wet weed Frank in the passenger seat yells &#34;look at that!&#34; WTF are those things zigzagging over the dump!?  These objects  were shooting lasers at each other and moving around just missing each other by what looked like inches.  Then in a second one was over the car on the passenger side more so I could see it as plain as day it was only 30 ft. up.  It was Egg shaped with sections of colors that were pulsating dim to bright and changing colors from one section to the next.  It was so beautiful I still get a tear in my eyes thinking about how unearthly it was.  I knew it wasn&#39;t from this planet.  But the other 3 guys weren&#39;t going to stick around to watch what could happen next.  So we started driving out of there.  As we were peeling out Gary in the back said they&#39;re all coming together in a ball.  So the other Gary driving the car turned the car around and shot it off, at the gravel entrance facing the bottom of the pit on the 30 degree, as the 4 ufos came together as one incredibly bright light a beam hit the car, the car was going crazy with noise and the lights were flickering on off then the car started moving without it running up the gravel in reverse grinding gears and lights on off radio stations changing all at once crazy!  It was terrifying and then it was over. It was gone that fast.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were on the road driving is my next memory.  I recall the entire event. I went to the Branford PD the next morning and reported it.  I don&#39;t blame the officer for not taking me serious.  Can&#39;t say I would have.  Anyway he did say that calls came in about bright lights over the dump.  So that&#39;s my story and I&#39;m sticking to it.<n>

The lights appeared to be seven or eight feet off the ground, extremely bright, and coming from a stand of trees about a quarter of a mile from the house.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thinking someone was either poaching deer or stealing cattle, he hobbled into the house (broken leg) got his shotgun and drove his truck through the rain soaked grass toward the gate at the rear of the east pasture and the lights.  As he neared the gate and the lights everything went black.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When he came to he was dizzy.  His truck would not start.  He was so disoriented he couldn’t figure out where he was. He called for help on the CB, &#34;I don’t know where I am.&#34;  His wife responded on the CB that he was out at the back gate in the east pasture.  Again he said he didn’t know where he was. Others heard him on the CB and told him to turn on his lights. He did, only now he was in the west pasture a half mile from the gate and where he had seen the lights. How did you get there his wife asked? I dont know, he replied.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The two pastures, one east and one west, are separated by a deep tree filled hollow running north to south almost the entire length of the property. According to the witness’ wife, he could not get from one side of the property to the other without passing the house or going through the hollow. If he had passed the house she would have would have seen and heard him, which she hadn’t. And going through the thick tree filled hollow in a truck would be impossible.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The CBers who had been hearing this recounted that they had heard him say that the truck was spinning and there was a great deal of intererence on the radio. Concerned, they went to the house to see if they could help. When they arrived the witness had managed to drive back to the house and seemed less disoriented. The CBers drove out to the pasture and found only one set of truck tracks. They then walked the field to see if they could see any broken trees in the hollow which they didn’t.  They also examined the witness for head trauma which he did not have. The sheriff was called and a report filed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After the incident the witness reported that his alternator and voltage regulator had stopped working. He also stated that his watch had lost 12 minutes of time. The witness and wife both stated that they could find no way for the truck to be moved other than it was lifted and put down in the other pasture.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Report taken by B.

When I read the book Communion, I got chills at the mention of &#39;screen memories&#39;.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have a memory from when I was about eight years old that has bugged me whole life.  It was before bedtime, and for some reason I was looking out the front window.  I was wide awake, and I did not have a fever that may cause hallucinations.  The way my memory retains it, I saw a large pink house floating in the sky.  It was glowing.  I recall passing out or something to that effect.  There are other memories, such as seeing a small man in my room at night...and I remember thinking it was &#39;E.T.&#39;. I kept the memories in the back of my mind for years. I have other memories from high school, that inolve me lying in bed and having the strange feeling that the &#39;pink house&#39; was coming back. I saw a movie called Communion during my freshman year, and was terrified of the image of the being.  This perplexes me, being someone who likes monster movies.  I just turned 21, and all of these memories have just started to come together.  I recently read the book Communion, and had a strange experience.  When I got to a part about what the author refers to as &#39;screen memories&#39;, a vision of the &#39;pink house&#39; popped in my head and my entire body went ice cold.  I was paralyzed; stunned.<n>
