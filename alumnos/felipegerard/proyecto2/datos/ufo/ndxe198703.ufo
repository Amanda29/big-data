3/31/87 23:00|East Helena|MT|Triangle|5 mins|Triange hovers over highway, moves at increasing speed over highway then disappears|2/14/06|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/048/S48631.html|1|ndxe198703| Triange hovers over highway, moves at increasing speed over highway then disappears<n> <n><n> <n><n> On a late sat. evening, near national guard firing range east of Helena Montana (on way to Townsend), I drove under triangular shaped object w/ white lights on each corner.  I Assumed at first that it was a helicopter over the highway as many fly around the range, we also see alot of parachute flares when the guard trains at night.  When realized the object was a few hundred feet over the highway, I stopped van, got out w/ friend and looked up at the object that emitted only what sounded VERY faintly like an aircraft APU.  The object remained directly overhead for not more than 20 secs and then tilted forward, moved slowly at first over the highway in the direction of Helena.  My friend and I followed the object in the van speeding at one point up to 100mph for not more than a minute then the object seemed to disappear (lost in the city lights of East Helena).  We drove to the Helena airport and saw no activity there.  The next day we returned to the Helena airport (in the daylight) and saw no strange aircraft but a few USAF cars - as far as I know there is no AF presence in Helena.  My friend an I were basically laughed out of high school when we told a few friends and our parents...although one friend had an uncle who was a veterinarian that seemed interested because of some strange cattle mutilations that had happened in the area... I put this out of my mind as something that I could never talk about but a coworker mentioned about flying triangles after seeing some t.v. shows regarding this subject.  After looking on this website, I noted that another gentleman in the Helena area had a similar experience in broad daylight..I would be very interested in talking to that individual.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

It was dark around 9 I believe because my grandmother was watching her soap opera.  This circular light no bigger than a car tier came from behind us high in the air and past us slowly with out a sound and hovered over the hill near a house up there like a helicopter but without sound.  It went back and forward around the house changing size and sometimes turning off and apearing somewhere eals.  I had ran back in the house to get my sisters and friend.  When i came back out the light was gonne.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date is approximate.  PD))<n>
3/23/87 00:55|Apache Junction|AZ|Changing|30 seconds|On March 23rd 1987 at 0055 a object broke up above us to the left of salt river dam, and we heard a crash near weaver's needle.|6/18/04|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/037/S37372.html|3|ndxe198703| On March 23rd 1987 at 0055 a object broke up above us to the left of salt river dam, and we heard a crash near weaver&#39;s needle.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((name deleted)) and I ((name deleted)) were out exploring, earlier in the day checking out different parts of the Salt River Dam.  We ended up below the dam.  We were trying to catch fish in the puddles in an area that supports the dam -kind of like a second dam but not.  We became stuck in the sand with my mitsubishi mini pickup.  We&#39;d jack it up and get out then get re-stuck.  We rested for a while and hiked around goofing off.  We didn&#39;t care we&#39;d get out.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;d turn on the headlights and light music and we&#39;d fish from the head lights.  Then al of a sudden streaking through the sky we could see what ((my friend)) called a shooting star at first.  I said that isn&#39;t far enough away to be a shooting star and you can hear the damn thing.  As it got close we could immediately see it in several pieces spreading out.  We about 1/8 to a 1/4 mile away we watched a trasformer blow up into pieces.  Then seconds later we heard a distant crash noise.  We went home and told our friends and family.  We were listened to -politely, but not taken seriously because the MIR had broken up at the same time and landed in water.  Well, Wes and I believe that there is more to the MIR then meets the eye, and that more than one piece came down, multiple pieces came down.  We went back and looked around the desert where we thought the bigger piece(s) came down.  It was like looking for a needle in the hay stack.  As a matter of fact we figured it had fallen within a mile and a half from Weaver&#39;s Needle (a rock formation were gold is suppose to be hidden long ago).<n> <n><n> <n><n> Oh, I let a lot of air out of my tires to get all the way out of the sand -and drove to a gas station slowly!  Thanks,  RJ<n>

Walking across a large street (205 St.) I looked up and saw a perfect v-shaped formation of brilliant lights. It moved slowly and silently and the lights looked like they were attached to something or affixed to eachother. The lights changed color in perfect unison and in almost a &#34;swirling&#34; fashion. It was SW of where we were walking and it appeared to be huge. It was stunning and I immediately felt emotional looking at it. My friends looked at it after I yelled out. They were reluctant to talk about it then or afterward. There was a blurb on the 11:00 local news that night due to numerous calls about lights in the sky. They said they were told (by whom I&#39;m not sure) that it was a formation of aircraft. The explanation didn&#39;t make sense then and it still doesn&#39;t. I&#39;m hoping someone else out there saw it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous;  provides no contact information.

Just outside Scottsdale, AZ we seen a light, VERY BRIGHT, behind a desert mountain, and it lit up the background of the mountain so bright it lit up the entire area.  We both said, Holly ****, and tried to say that is MUST be just a helicopter taking off behind the mountain, and there MUST be an airport there, so we hit the odometer on the truck and continued to drive slowly down the road.  The light started to get brighter, and brighter, and in an INSTANT the light (WHITE IN COLOR) shot straight up into the sky, and defied all laws of gravity as it streaked across the sky as fast as a shooting star, but it went UP, and after a ways, then turned right (horizontal). My brother and I couldn&#39;t believe our eyes?  We did continue on the the lake. (Bartlett Lake, AZ), near Horseshoe Lake, and fished the morning and afternoon.  On the way home we decided to stop and get out where we set the odometer, and we were still MILES FROM TOWN!  As we noticed in the daylight the mountain that was lit up earlier that morning could be seen as we drove back to Scottsdale. There was NO AIRPORT, and there was NO Buildings, or houses for MILES.  We decided NOT to tell anyone as we feared we would be called CRAZY or that we MADE IT UP?  I only now tell this to whoever reads this, so maybe SOMEONE ELSE seen the same thing back then?  Maybe this happened and was REPORTED BACK THEN? The date is approximate, as years have gone by, but I am sure it was the spring time, and I am SURE of the time in the morning!  We never saw a SHAPE of a craft, but the size of light was beyond belief!  We both had been in helicopters and airplanes, and had seen them in the air at night MANY TIMES BEFORE? This was something else?  I hope this may be confirmed by other witnesses?  We would like to KNOW if what we saw was truly a UFO?  We both know it was NOT FROM THIS EARTH? Thank you for listening. OH, it made NO SOUND.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.  PD))<n>
3/10/87 20:00|Medford|NY|Formation|5 minutes|Similar to lights over Phoenix|10/30/06|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/051/S51938.html|6|ndxe198703| Similar to lights over Phoenix<n> <n><n> <n><n> I recently saw a show on television featuring the Lights over Phoenix.  I have not heard of that phenomona prior to seeing the show.  I am writing because I saw the exact same lights phonomena over Medford Long Island New York in 1987 or perhaps it was 1986.  I was in the backl seat of a car heading north around 7:00 to approximately 8:30 pm when I noticed in the North Eastern Sky a formation of lights that appeared almost exactly as did the lights over phoenix.  However, the lights that I saw where slightly smaller.  There were approximately 5 - 10 and they were moving in unison.  I can&#39;t remember the exact time of day or even the month, but I never will forget it and how similar it was to the lights over phoenix.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous;  provides no contact information.

This road is very dark at night. Me and my three buddies were going out to get some beers.  On the way we saw this big flash of light and it made all of us jump out our boots.  Our car engine died and wouldn&#39;t re-start.  We looked up and saw a green glowing egg shaped craft. We got scared and ran through the woods.  We later returned to out car and there was no sign of the craft.  We told the sheriff but he didn&#39;t believe us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

It was some time in March just before midterms.  I was sound alseep and suddenly awoke to a red light coming in through the blinds.  The light was very bright, like fire.  At first I thought the apartment building next door was on fire, then I felt a static electric feeling and the red light covered my body moving from my feet upwards toward my head.  I was paralyzed and could hardly breathe.  It seemed to last forever, but it was really only a few seconds.  After the light got to my scalp it left and the window was dark again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was terrified, so I called a friend. I was crying and shaking.  My friend told me it was just a street lamp shining in or the brakes on a car. I was on the second floor of a building that was facing another building.  I was at the end of the building farthest from the road.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I insisted that it wasn&#39;t a light from the street, the red light was angled from above my window.  She said that it was just a dream and I was stressed because mid-terms was coming up.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have never forgotten this light that &#34;scanned&#34; my body or the feeling that went with it.   Since that time I have had terrible nightmares of something swooping down from the cieling at me.  When I awake from these dreams, I am usually yelling at them and the swooping things have taken on the form of an object in the room.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I don&#39;t remember having any different marks or anything after the light came in, but I started remembering events that I had never remembered before about childhood abuse.   I&#39;m not sure the memories are real, but the feelings that go along with them are very real.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Has anyone else ever experienced anything similar.  I&#39;ve not told anyone about this incident, other than my friend, because no one would beleive me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.

3/1/87 01:00|Revere|MA|Light|1 hour|Dancing Lights in sky as a child.|3/6/01|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/016/S16669.html|10|ndxe198703| Dancing Lights in sky as a child.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I was 16 years old my bedroom windows faced south towards Boston. In the Winter I had a clear view from my window in Beachmont all the way to the Blue Hills in Quincy. (Across Logan Airport) Well one night I noticed in the sky pretty far away (I&#39;d guess 10-20 miles) at about a 40 degree angle off the ground, two small but bright lights (about the intensity of Jupiter) chasing eachother in strange circles, zig zags, drops, changes of direction, reverses, stops and hovering. This went on for about an hour until the both zoomed upward and toward the west until they faded from view. I had the impression they must have been over quincy or farther south. I had seen airplanes out this window for 16 years up to that point and had never (nor have I since) seen anything like that. They were not airplanes. Just small, dancing, dots of lights.<n>
