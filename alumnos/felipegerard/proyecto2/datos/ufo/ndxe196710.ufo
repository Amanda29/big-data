It was completly dark except for the lights on the court. I saw a round light in the sky at about 50 degrees up off the horizon.  It was roughly twice the size of Venus. It did not blink or flash but it did slowly change colors as it moved through the sky.  It was moving to the east when it decended to about 10 degrees off of the horizon in one second.  It moved eratically for a few seconds then ascended rapidley out of sight to the north and east.  I grew up around USAF bases and am quite familiar with what military and civilian aircraft look like at night. To this day I have never seen anything like what I saw that night.  I got spooked and emidiately left the tennis courts and went back to my college dorm.  My tennis partner did not see this object but was quite concerned about my emotional state.<n>

It’s approximate.  However I am very sure it was during a Halloween Carnival which makes it even more weird.  So it was probably late October.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I saw two round and very bright objects.   They were both white in color.  They were traveling in parallel on the same path and trajectory.   They were flying from south to north at about 45 degrees above the western horizon.  They made no sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It’s hard to describe their size.  They were definitely a lot bigger than the brightest star or planet.  They were definitely a lot bigger than any aircraft lights at any altitude.  They were definitely smaller than the moon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My first impression was that they were flying at low altitude because of their large size.  However I later decided that they could be at any altitude.  It’s hard to get some frame of reference when there is nothing else nearby to compare to.  So I really don’t know what their altitude was.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It took me years to figure out what I saw.  At one time I thought they were car headlights reflecting off of power lines.  Power lines are strung in parallel.  However there were no power lines.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Finally about 25 years after the event I came to the conclusion that it was a meteorite that had broken into two pieces.  Both pieces were still flying on the same course and trajectory as the original meteorite would have been had it not broken up.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It seems very reasonable that this is in fact what I saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n> No one else was with me at the time so there are no other witnesses.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

10/20/67 18:00|Old Greenwich|CT|Disk|30 seconds|Very OLD sighting of glowing blue object hovering over RR tracks/wires in SW Connecticut. 1967!|2/1/07|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/054/S54240.html|3|ndxe196710| Very OLD sighting of glowing blue object hovering over RR tracks/wires in SW Connecticut. 1967!<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am entering a very old sighting now, because until today I had nowhere I knew of to report the sighting which has affected me since it happened, almost 40 years ago.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was 17 years old. This occurred on a late October early evening in 1967.  I was driving in a convertible car with a fellow on our way to a party.  It was just past dusk, I&#39;d say around six thirty or so.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were driving on a town road past a park where the railroad tracks run parallel to the street but up a hill.  As we approached a steep hill running alongside the tracks we saw a huge disk hovering over  the tracks and the electric wire towers.  It is difficult to determine size because we couldn&#39;t determine how close it was to us or the wires.  It seemed to be 20-30 ft long.  It was blueish in color and seemed translucent.  Small, evenly placed square or rectangular windows lining the front edge were visible to us.  There was absolutely no noise or flashing lights.  The front edge appeared to be about 50 ft from us and about 30 ft up from the street level.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As the two of us started to point and shout about what we were seeing, in a flash it took a quick jolt westward and then took off that direction so quickly that it could not be tracked.  We sped up the hill in front of us to try to follow but saw nothing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Over the years I have been tempted to undergo hypnosis to ascertain if there had been any further contact between myself and the UFO that evening, but I was afraid to learn anything new.  I was already affected by the sighting and didn&#39;t want to become obsessed with it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About 15 years later I happened to see the fellow I was with that evening and the first thing we both said upon our chance meeting was &#34;Did that really happen?&#34;  So I know that he was similarly affected.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Years later, in the late 1980&#39;s my then husband and I had a sighting in the evening skies, but that was simply lights seemingly flying in formation, again soundless, and then suddenly disappearing.  This occurred over Norwalk, CT in the late &#39;80&#39;s, not sure of exact dates.  We did not report anything.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I realize that this report is long after the fact, but it is important to me to have some record made of this sighting.  I would love to be contacted by anyone else who might have had a similar sighting at that time in SW CT or Westchester County, NY, area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

In Oct. 1967 I (age18) was taking three friends home from the recreation center in the Village. As we turned a corner on a dirt road, in front of us was a round circle of light about 12ft in circumference. I stopped about 15ft away and the car stop running. When the car would not start I got out of the car and stood with the door open, &#34;the guys were yeiling to get back in and lets go&#34;. The object went straight up, stop and moved straight out over the lake and then it went into wrap speed. It was amazing how fast it was. I got back into the car, the guys yeiling &#34;lets go, lets go&#34;, I turned the key and the car started, one guys notic the time and said he would be in trouble for geting in late, we had been there 35 minutes but it seem like 2 minutes. THE 4TH WITNESSES: I worked at the Village Supermarket and when I was taking a break with some other guys this co-worker asked if anyone saw anything flying out over the lake last night, I said, a bright light? He became excited when he found out someone else had seen this and gave us his version of what he saw; the brightness, how it changed directions only horizontaly and diagonaly.  I don&#39;t remember anything happening in those 35 minutes that we lost.<n>

I was babysitting my younger siblings.  At around 10 pm I was watching Bonanza on T.V.  When it was over I went to my room to get ready for bed.  When I shut off the light, I was startled that my room was still very bright and then I heard a strange noise,a drawn out hum!  My small poodle ran down the hall barking, the hum changed tone and got louder.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I looked out my window and the whole area was brightly lit.  I went down the hall and could see the sliding glass door.  Standing in front was a very tall humanoid shape!  The curtain rod seemed to go through his head at eye level.  I only saw the outline of a human shaped figure.  I asked &#34;what do you want?&#34;   No answer!  I believe I asked twice!<n> <n><n> <n><n> Next thing I remember I was running into my room!  I jumped on the bed and the humming got louder, then the light and noise stopped.  I heard a vehicle.  It was a jeep with a spot light on it and two men. They were pointing to the sky.  I ran to the other window but never saw the craft.  It was now 2 am.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date in late 1967 is approximate.

Hart high.    Every one in the canyon had horse property, My three freinds and I had  just gone on late ride in the querry,  and we were sitting on a hill,avoiding going in for the night to out parents. it was very dark, We lived 12 miles back in a canyon called Sand   canyon.  There were few lights in the canyon, and we could see every star. Suddenly, 6 lights or &#34;Orbs&#34; of light , extremely bright, megenta, or reddish purple, cant really describe the color, suddenly appeared, over the mountian across from us about 2 miles away I&#39;d guess, and the lights just sat there stationary in a row, 6 lights,for about a minete or less, then they split up into 3, each flying away in 2 directions so fast, that I knew in my soul, that nothing moves that fast in the sky on this earth! 3 lights on one side, 3 lights on the other side of the sky several miles apart dancing, zip zip up and back, then just as fast as the parted they came back together in a row, and 6 lights sat in a row, and turned from the megenta color to white.  There was no glow around the lights and there was absolutely no sound.  Remeber, we are on the edge of the Los Angeles forest, in 1967, no sound at night, you could always hear a pin drop, and those lights made no sound. At first I thought it was some new airplane coming from the army base just around the mountian from us.  The school bus picked up the kids from the base every morning so it made sence for a minete, but when the orbs of light moved so fast I knew there was something strange about them.  Then after about 3 or 4 seconds, the lights changed back to megenta and off they went, gone so fast that I hardly saw them go at all, and they were all in a row of megenta lights when they went.<n> <n><n> <n><n> none of us four kids ever talked about it and none of us told our perents, because we knew no one would beleive us, and actually we didnt beleive it!  We just thought that there was some explination, and we&#39;d never know because we were just high school kids in a mountian town, full of hicks,who&#39;d care?  It&#39;s 42 years later and I know what I saw, and now I beleive that the 6 lights were probably atatched to one object, from hearing other peaples experiences.  And by the way, that army base didnt test planes.  Remember, I was 17 years old, what did I know about army or airforce?  But I know what I saw!<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD))<n>

It was a glowing fireball, which at first I thought to be a fire in the hills, but it remained contained and motionless in the sky. It appeared to be dripping or shedding bits of fiery material. I watched as long as I could then got into my car to go home from my Friday evening job.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

I also have only mentioned this to a handful of people and 50 percent of the ones I mentioned this to would be very skeptical.  There were 5 witnesses to this incident, me and my 2 siblings and my grandparents that are now deceased.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On October 15 1967 I was a 7 year old child, and my brother and sister were picked up at a friend of my grandparents  that kept us after school until my grandparents who owned a small business closed up shop and could take us home. That night my grandparents dropped off groceries at the house before coming to get us and on the way back in the car, I heard my grandfather say &amp;quot; I wish I could see that strange light again that I saw on the way to get the kids.. I am not sure what it was. Maybe a helicopter or something&amp;quot; A few minutes later as we were turning off the main road and onto a dirt road going to the house, my grandfather said &amp;quot;there it is again!&amp;quot;  He slowed the car down and suddenly a reddish orange disk moved slowly at a little above tree top level and heading over the car. My grandfather stopped and said &amp;quot;I want to see this!&amp;quot; and my grandmother told him to keep going.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I remember vividly the disk was rotating and looked as if was glowing red hot like a stove burner on high. Also, the disk would have bits of flame or sparks that would fly off the leading edges of the disk. The strangest thing about it was that even though it was very bright it gave off no light anywhere. I asked my grandmother what it was and she didn&#39;t want to disturb us anymore and said, &#34;Oh it is probably a flare set off by the Coast Guard.&#34;   As a child I believed this because we lived near the Atlantic Ocean.  We went home and she fed us and put us to bed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The next morning my mother, who was working the all night shift came home at about 7 a.m.  As I was getting up to go to school, I overheard my grandmother telling my mother about the incident and she was very concerned, a total 180 from the &#34;Coast Guard story,&#34; that she told us kids.  I realized that something strange had indeed occurred.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A few years later when I was older I asked my grandmother about it and she said of course it was something unexplainable and peculiar but she didn&#39;t want us children to be scared.  And said I will never know what it was.  Also, a couple of years after the incident, me and a friend were walking through the woods near where the incident occurred and found a spot in the woods that was a perfect circle about 2 feet in diameter that nothing would grow in.  We found that to be strange and my friend used to refer to it as the &#34;UFO spot&#34; our favorite place to hang out.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I went back about a year ago to see if the spot was still there but there are houses developed there now and I could not find it.  I may go to the place and look again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have reported this as best as I can and remember.  The incident still remains quite vivid in my mind.  This  is a true and accurate account of what we witnessed on October 15, 1967.<n>

Suddenly several of what appeared to be stars began to move in various directions,they looked like stars,two of which came together became one and continued to move about. A seperate star like object moved away completely all across the night sky whilst the others remained in the region of the plough. After some ten minutes there was only the frame of the plough to be seen. My wife,myself our two children and two people in a nearby car all saw this event,we allerted the people in the car because we couldnt believe what we were seeing,it was quite frightening. When we arrived home in Oldham two hours later we reported it to Joddrell Bank but never saw other reports of sitings or received any response. No one will tell us we imagined it, no way it was very real,something was up there and it was not satelites either. I hope you can throw some &#34;light&#34;on our experience<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Exact date is unknown.  PD))<n>

She speaks quite eloquently about her sighting, and she will have the other two living witnesses submit reports, as well.  PD))<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> The year was 1967. I was 32 years old. I was driving out Montevallo Road, going from the mall to my home. My ten year old son, my nine year old son and my thirteen year old stepson were with me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was driving a convertible and the top was down.  It was dusk, I don&#39;t know the exact time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> All of a sudden we looked up, I do not know why, and saw, hovering above the trees on the right side of the street, a huge craft.  It was oval in shape with a smaller dome on top.  Around this smaller dome was a row of windows and there were lights in the windows.  I heard a soft whirring sound, smooth and barely perceptible.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It stayed there for five minutes or so and then zoomed off to the west with a speed that was incomprehensible.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I pulled off on a side street and pulled over to the curb and parked the car.  The boys and I were all stunned.  I asked them to tell me what they had seen.  We each spoke in turn and we all saw the same thing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At that time my husband owned a large company in Birmingham and any negative or questionable activity was a threat to his reputation so I told the boys that we would tell their dad when we got home and then we must never talk about it again.  We could not risk losing customers.  The people in Birmingham were peculiar in some ways and it was better to keep quiet.  We did tell my husband when we got home and then we never talked about it again for many years.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A few years ago I began to tell some of my close friends about it.  As you get older you worry less and less about what other people might think and I wanted to share my experience.  My son who was ten at the time has passed away but I asked my son who was nine at the time if he remembered that everning and he said, &#34;Oh, yes.&#34;  I cautioned them so much he has not talked about it much but he still remembers it exactly the way I do.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My husband died many years ago and I have lost touch with his children but I am sure his son, who was thirteen at the time, still remembers.  You cannot forget because it changes everything you ever thought ab out the world you live in.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I loved the experience and would love to see another one but realize I probably never will.  It was a beautiful ship and so far advanced from anything we have on this planet.  The material it was made of reminded me of one of those globes you see over a hall light, a glass or plastic globe that allows the light to shine through.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The ship had a yellowish, or golden glow, as if it was lit behind the material it was made of.  The lights in the window were brighter than the soft glow of the ship itself.  I don&#39;t know how big it was, it seemed quite large though not as large as a football field.  But I am not good at judging distances so I don&#39;t know how high it was but it seemed rather close, though not directly  above the trees.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am 73  now and did want to make some official report before it is too late.  I don&#39;t know if this is the right place to do it but I will continue to search websites in regard to this.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.

It was pulsating red, orange ,red, orange like a heartbeat.I could not see any windows in it. I was terrified &amp; could not speak --I just hung on to the horses mane--dumbstruck. Finally I shouted my friend&#39;s name. She turned towards me (she was some way away from me)As she did so , the huge object flew up, and away in a high parabola, incredibly quickly.

We were standing waistdeep in the water in front of our duckblind setting out decoys in preparation for the morning hunt. My friend said &#34;look at the funny ring around the moon tonight&#34;. I looked up. It was a perfectly clear, calm night and you could see all the stars.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Off to our left, close to the town of Philipsburg, Quebec was a strange object with a glowing ring around it which in some ways did resemble a full moon. However, the actual moon was plainly visible directly in front of us over Vermont State. I said that&#39;s not the moon, the moon is over here in front of us.The object seemed to stay stationary for some minutes then it approached very rapidly and positioned itself directly above us. It also appeared to be much lower as it appeared to increase in both size, an intensity of the glowing ring around it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I said lets load up our shotguns because we may be shooting something other than ducks this morning. We grabbed our shotguns from the boat and both loaded up with SSG... equivalent to Double O Buckshot. My intentions were to rattle some buckshot off from it if it got too close!<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object remained stationary, directly over us for 5-10 minutes. Then, it seemed to rapidly...and I mean rapidly... evaporate going almost directly straight up into a perfectly clear, star-filled sky. The actual moon was still plainly visible in it&#39;s original location. I then realized that the hair on the back of my neck was standing straight up. I have never experienced this feeling either before or since.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My friend turned to me in astonishment and said how are we going to tell anyone about this? I said forget it, if we tried to tell this to anyone they would think we were both either idiots or worse...totally crazy. Whatever it was, I am definitely convinced by the speed it left going practically straight up that it was not from this planet! It made me a firm believer in UFO&#39;s. This is the first time I have ever reported this incident. I do not know if my friend has ever reported it or not. I have not been in contact with him for some years.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date is approximate.  PD))<n>

Back in the Nam I was part of a LRRP unit. LRRP stands for Long Range Recon Patrol and it consisted of a team of 6 men. a Team Leader, Asistant Team Leader, Medic, Engineer, Weapons Specialist, and Radioman. I was out with my team in IV Corps in the Vietnam Jungles. We had humped through the boonies all day and we set up an NDP (Night Defensive Perimeter). We took turns sleeping and keeping watch. At about 01:45 I heard movement ahead. My bro Levin heard it too. We woke up the other 4 men and we all readied ourselves for the upcoming contact. Suddenly we saw it... an alien. In real life. My stomach sank as I saw the creature. It looks like the modern alien... a grey human with a long face and large black eyes. It gave off an eery glow. Anyway, my friend Boltach raised his weapon and fired. He hit the being in the head with a short controlled burst. A brilliant blue syrupy fluid splattered the trees behind the alien. Just then we saw a dull light in the sky. Back then, we had a device called a Starlight scope. Only special operations had them. It is a lot like night vision. I focused in on the light in the sky and at that moment two more lights appeared. They formed the shape of a perfect triangle. The light at the top circled the two below in a figure 8 and zipped off. The remaining two seemed to collide and both zip off in the same direction as the first light. That night two other LRRP teams in our AO (area of operations)reported in the same activities. We called into HQ and they said they were having radio problems and would be offline for the rest of the night. We linked up with the other 2 teams for security reasons and shared our encounter with them. 4 of the other men with me on my team that night were later killed in various engagements in the war and I haven&#39;t been able to get in contact with anyone from the other teams. Only me and Levin are still around. I hope you can come up with other stories and vets who have reporting UFOs in the Nam. Out.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
10/7/67 22:00|Lantana|FL|Other|3minutes|UFO report and theory of motion.|11/28/07|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/059/S59476.html|14|ndxe196710| UFO report and theory of motion.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was coming home from a date.I remember the moon was in full or just about full. There had been a fire in the woods across the street earlier that day.I was going through the carport and started to enter the house when the lights went out.  I looked to see if there was a fire going on and as i turned around i heard and saw a woosh and a circular dark spot moving across the field.  I went to see what it was and the bottom was circular but the top was triangular.  As it went southeast towards the ocean and disappeared the lights came back on.  Made no sound but the woosh and it was about 50ft above the ground.  There were three bright lights pulsating in motion one after another..right to left.  The lights were white.  The object may have been silver.  The motion of the craft would appear to be using magnetic field generated by the electricity of power lines similar to the theory based on the history channels show tonight about aliens and the earth.  This is what has prompted me to write this to you.  I believe we are on to something.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD))<n>

The lights went in a sequencial motion around this disk almost one would fade out and the other come on. My aunt told us to get in the car and we would follow it. We followed it for a while but the disk just all of a sudden dissapeared. The craft did not make any noise,and it moved in a zig zag movement but when it dissapeared it just took off. My aunt called the police and asked them if they had had any reports of any thing that night and they said it was probably a weather ballon. I know different. This was in the 60&#39;s late if I remember correctly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>
10/5/67 04:00|Syracuse|NY|Disk|2 minutes|silent luminescent disc shining in the pre-dawn sky|4/16/05|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/042/S42632.html|16|ndxe196710| silent luminescent disc shining in the pre-dawn sky<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was a humid night and I awoke in the early morning in my dorm room as I heard the milk truck making noise in the alley below. My hair was still damp as I had washed it the night before and went to bed with it wet.  I was uncomfortable in the room and had the window opened with the curtains drawn back.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was then that I looked up into the sky and saw a bright saucer type object.  I was very scared as I was alone in the room.  I thought I might have been dreaming so pinched myself.  I walked around the room and then  looked for my camera and snapped a shot even though there was no film in the camera. I was in awe, both excited and scared at the same time.  I felt privledged to be a witness to the sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had always thought people who believed in this type of thing were foolish. All these thoughts crowded my head.  I felt like going next door and waking up the girl who lived there, and telling her to look out the window.  But I was afraid to even go into the hallway.  So I watched the object until it left.  Who knows how long it was there, could have been about 30 seconds to a couple minutes.  My mind was racing so seconds could have been minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have no idea how far away it was, but it was just over the city.   The saucer was highly luminescent or polished, a silvery color.  It was illuminated, but I never saw lights per se.  When the object left at a fantastic speed, I saw what appeared to be sparkling dust slowly sifting down. I remember thinking how beautiful it looked.  I have never been able to believe it was from a different planet.  Could it have been a hologram or a photo of some type projected onto the sky?   Don&#39;t know.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was never anything in the paper about it, and my friends, the ones I told, were very skeptical.  Still, I didn&#39;t tell everyone as I didn&#39;t want to be known for seeing it.  And I didn&#39;t want to be mocked, which is what I may have done if it had been someone else. I was glad for the experience, but wish there had been an explanation.  Maybe someone else in Syracuse saw it that night, and like myself, was too shy to come forward. I know it was not a dream or an illusion.  I had not been drinking as it was a school night.  That&#39;s about all I can remember.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous.  PD))<n>
10/1/67 20:00|Minneapolis|MN|Disk|10 seconds|In October 1967, 2 Disks sited heading north over Minneapolis MN.|4/16/05|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/042/S42245.html|17|ndxe196710| In October 1967, 2 Disks sited heading north over Minneapolis MN.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am estimating the date and time based on where we lived at the time, and the fact that I was wearing a jacket. I was 10 years old at the time. We lived in the 9xx unit on Olson Highway, in Minneapolis MN. My mother had sent me out to find my younger brother because it was getting dark. I remember that I had a jacket on, it was cool (and dry) but not cold, late September or early October. I was gone about 1/2 hour, and by the time I returned it was almost dark, and there was no one else in our front yard area. I had just entered edge of our front lawn, and was about 30 feet from the front door of our unit/apartment. As I entered the front lawn, I do no know why, but for some reason I had weird feeling, that something was above me. As I looked up, traveling due north at a slow rate of speed, I saw two round disks. They were left of me at about 10-15 degrees from vertical and in front of me by about the same amount. I could therefore not have seen the objects out of the corner of my eye.<n> <n><n> <n><n> One distinguishing characteristic was that their bottoms, which is all I saw, appeared to be on fire. This did not appear to be a form of propulsion. It was almost exactly like the appearance of the bottoms of the saucers in the movie Independence Day.  However, they were much higher, with the appearance of about the size of a silver dollar held at arms length. They did not seem very high, possibly about a mile high. I&#39;ll just add that the fiery bottoms are what one might expect as a result of friction with the atmosphere if such an object entered the atmosphere at a high rate of speed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I immediately looked towards my front door and tried to yell to get the attention of someone inside, but I could not yell. I looked back up and the disks were moving at the same speed. I then ran into our apartment and tried to speak, but still could not speak, and after about 5 seconds, I headed out the back door with the family behind me. However, the two disks were no longer overhead. I still could not speak, and we went back inside our apartment. It was about another 10 seconds after I was inside before I was able to speak. I &#34;blurted&#34; out, &#34;I saw a flying saucer&#34;. I was unable to speak for a total of about 2 minutes, and the only way to describe it is, it was as if my brain had a mind of its own. In my mind/brain, it was like someone had pressed a &#39;fast rewind&#39; button. When I tried to speak, I could not interrupt what was going on in my brain. I had to close my eyes and concentrate real hard, and was eventually able to regain control and speak.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I never saw anything like it before or since the above event. I also never (before or since), had a problem where I was unable to speak like that. At the time, I was above average in intelligence, especially in math. Before the above event, as opposed to being someone who was fascinated with outer space, I don&#39;t recall having any interest in it at all, which changed after the above event. I have told a few friends over the years, but it is not something you can prove, so why bother. However, my mother did call the airport, who indicated they had received no other reports.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of sighting is approximate.  PD))<n>
10/1/67 19:00|Hudson's Hope (Canada)|BC|Sphere|2 Minutes|Large round silver UFO in Peace River Valley 1966-67|2/18/01|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/016/S16491.html|18|ndxe196710| Large round silver UFO in Peace River Valley 1966-67<n> <n><n> <n><n> My dad and mom and I were returning to Hudson&#39;s Hope from Fort St. John where we had been shopping.  Dad was driving, mom was laying down snoozing in the back seat of the car.  I was in the right front passenger seat. We were going up a hill and off to our left suddenly a large light came on and lit up the hill and the inside of our car.  Dad pulled over and stopped the car and told mom to get up.  The light went out.  There was no sound, nothing then the light came back on again and off again and I guess took off. This thing was round and was roughly as big as our car.  The light it emitted was rather like looking at a brilliant silver dollar, it did not hurt your eyes to look at it.  We could make out no distinct features and it made no sound.  The area we were in is the Peace River Valley and the bank at that location falls away steeply about 600-700&#39;.  The evening was dark, no light, no snow on the ground but there were a few large lazy flakes falling.  My dad went to the RCMP and asked if they had &#34;heard of a helicopter in trouble or anything&#34; no they hadn&#39;t and dad never persued it.  My dad and mom owned their own business at the time and were very reliable people and wished to remain that way so we never talked outside the family about it but privately we thought it was a UFO not from this world and that they were here checking the mega project that was underway at that time (the W.A.C. Bennett Dam Project) where before there had been nothing but a few farms in this remote area of British Columbia, Canada.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

10/1/67 02:00|Chaffee|NY|Sphere|10 minutes|34 years ago and still " seeking the truth"|8/5/01|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/017/S17552.html|20|ndxe196710| 34 years ago and still &#34; seeking the truth&#34;<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have never posted my experience with anybody, but the more I read of these things I suppose nobody would believe us anyways. There were four of us sleeping out at a duck pond waiting for dawn to arrive when approximately 2:00 am there was a strange light overhead. All of us witnessed this light in the sky that appeared approximatly 1 mile above us. As we watched the light it began to come closer and closer, within 2 minutes the small light began to descend above the pond. the closer it got the brighter it became. Within seconds, the light (craft) had desended to approximately 100 yards over the pond. THE ENTIRE AREA SURROUNDING THE POND APPROXIMATLY ONE HALF MILE WAS DAYLIGHT. The craft sat there for maybe 2 minutes then began to ascend. In a minutes notice, it was gone. We all know what we saw, that was 34 years ago. This is a real life story that happened 34 years ago. The following day I called the New York State Police to see if there were any other reports from other witnesses, and they replied that they had a report that the NASA had issued a statement that a reflection from the moon had created this phenomom, and it had affectd WESTERN NEW YORK. The fact is we know what we seen 34years ago!!!!<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>
