12/25/69 21:38|Rogersville|AL||90-120 sec|single laser-like red light traced numerous straight-line and angular 'waypoints' in  Christmas night sky|6/20/11|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/081/S81785.html|1|ndxe196912| single laser-like red light traced numerous straight-line and angular &#39;waypoints&#39; in  Christmas night sky<n> <n><n> <n><n> On the crisp, cold Christmaas night of December 25, 1969, I was a 12 year old boy who had received my first substantial telescope as my main Christmas present, still pretextually delivered down my chimney by Santa Claus himself.  I was in the back yard of our home in Rogersville, Tennessee, with my father, an ex-Marine Corps fighter pilot Captain and dive bomber who served 4 1/2 years in WWII in the Pacific theatre, surviving the Battle of Midway.  Dad had become an attorney after the War and still was always curious about, and knew alot about the stars and constellations.  He was helping me get used to focusing the telescope and learning about some of the major stars and biggest consellations.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At approximately 9:30 pm or so, as my father was peering through the telescope searching for Cygnus, he suddenly snapped away from the telescope and stood straight up rigid.  He was nornmally a very reserved, almost stoic man of unflappable nature, but he scared me when he raised his voice and started pointing at the sky, telling me to &#34;Look!*** Look!***   What in the world is that??!!&#34;<n> <n><n> <n><n> He was wearing his old set of &#34;Stellar&#34; binoculars around his neck and raised them hurriedly to get a closer visual on what I could plainly see with my naked eye was an intense red point of light that moved across the entire sky in a zip-flash, stopped momentarily, zip-flashed away in a another straight line direction to a different point on the opposite end of the sky, remain there a moment and then zipped off straight to yet another opposing several points in the sky.  It finally left the last position we saw it stop at for a second and then zipped off and vanished.  The light was relatively tiny, but shown as brightly in that star-filled Christmas night as a red laser pointer on a black chalkboard in an unlit classroom.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In modern-techno hindsight, the pattern the light followed would suggest it was intentionally, purposefully and confidently moving with deliberation to predetermined and precise points in the sky while mapping and recording waypoints in what one could reasonably assume was some form of GPS system.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My father had never shown me animated and unrestrained excitement/concern over an event like that before, as he did that Christmas night.  In fact, he was so impressed with what we had seen that he felt the duty as a former Marine Pilot to pick up the phone and call directly to the Pentagon in Washington, DC that Christmas night to report, describe, time and date the event.  I remember he had to go through several different people until he got to someone who would take the information, and I know this personally because I sat right beside him and overheard him as he spoke to whoever was on the other line, whose voice(s) I could also faintly hear through the receiver.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Again, I remember it so vividly also because it was the first time in my life I ever had heard my father identify himself as &#34;former Marine Corps Captain******* with the *****Unit, Naval Fleet**** Pacific Command&#34; and proceeded to give them his specific official military number he still repeated from memory.  That! fact alone impressed me as much as anything.  Likewise, when he hung up, Dad said he was glad he called, but had been told that apparently a number of other people had been calling and reporting the same thing, although he had been assured by the Pentagon Official that if they ever determined what it was, that &#34;they would certainly inform him {Captain****]of their findings.&#34;   That call or following letter was never made or sent, as one would now expect.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;ve always wondered throughout my life if a FOIA request would ever produce official records of that memorable sighting and subsequent phone call to the Pentagon by my now long-dead Marine Corps dive bomber Dad (along with all the other callers, too.)  The realist in me says that if those records even existed, it would take a literal Act of Congress to get them produced and released, if even then.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We have spoken via telephone with the source of this report, and we consider him to be an exceptionally reliable, and capable, witness.  He submitted another report for a sighting of peculiar orange lights off the east coast of Pawleys Island, SC, an event witnessed on June 08, 2011.  PD))<n>

12/15/69 23:00|Richmond/Berea|KY|Circle|30 seconds|Circular shaped, glowing object, hovering but moving slowly, then  traveling at a speed of at least thousands of mies per hourl|10/30/06|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/052/S52055.html|5|ndxe196912| Circular shaped, glowing object, hovering but moving slowly, then  traveling at a speed of at least thousands of mies per hourl<n> <n><n> <n><n> In December, 1969, four of us--three 18 year old college  students and one professional, were traveling south on Interstate 75, returning home after a University of Kentucky basketball game.  South of Richmond, but north of Berea.  All four of us saw an object overhead, directly in front of us, with an apparant altitude of a few hundred feet.  The size cannot be estimated because the actual altitude could not be determined, as there were no clouds or hills, mountains, etc., behind the object..  The object was round, and glowing with a white color, giving an appearance similar to that of a floresent light, but round, i.e. a circle shape.  At that time, so far as I was aware, flouresent lights were only tube shaped, whether straight, or sometimes bent into a circle.  I am referring only to the type of light produced by the object.  The object had an apparant size larger than a full moon, and the brightness was similar to that of a full moon on a clear night.  It was definitely NOT, however, the moon.  The object was hovering, moving very slowly from east to west.  As we watched, the object suddenly accelerated to a speed far faster than it would seem would be possible within the laws of physics, and moved beyond the western horizon so quickly that it was virtually instantaneous.  At the point of the sighting, we were going down a long slope on the interstate, and the terrain was such that there was a very wide, unobstructed view toward the western horizon, of several miles.<n> <n><n> <n><n> &#34;Accelerted&#34; is actually not the correct word, because &#34;acceleration&#34; implies that the speed increased from a slow speed to a faster speed through a process of going faster and faster.  To the contrary, the object appeared to have NO TRANSITION from the slow east to west hover to a speed which covered miles from our location to the western horizon in, perhaps, a hundreth of a second.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The four of us agreed that we would not report the incident because of the ridicule that we would probably suffer.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About six years after the sighting, I saw a newspaper story in the Louisville Courier-Journal newspaper about a professor at Eastern Kentucky University, which is located in Richmond, who was gathering information about a large number of unexplained UFO sightings in the Richmond area over the previous several years.  The article pointed out that the US Army Bluegrass Depot, a storage area for nerve and other weapons grade gases, and perhaps other weapons, is located just south of Richmond.  I wrote to the professor, telling him about  the sighting in 1969, and offering to meet with him if he wished  He returned my correspondence, saying to contact him if I was in Richmond in the future, but did not seem anxious to hear the details of the sighting.  I never met with him.<n> <n><n> <n><n> All three of the observers who were students at the time are now professionals: an accountant, a pharmacist, and an attorney.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

12/15/69 21:00|Viet Nam (location not specified)||Disk|15 minutes|Saucer and Dome observed by Starlite Scope in Vietnam During the War.|7/16/03|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/029/S29430.html|6|ndxe196912| Saucer and Dome observed by Starlite Scope in Vietnam During the War.<n> <n><n> <n><n> While on guard duty in the Republic of Vietnam (with Battery A, 1st Battalion, 7th Artillery) my job was to scan the treeline with a starlite scope for enemy movement/lights.  We had received mortar fire recently upon our dug-in position in the &#34;Catcher&#39;s Mitt&#34; area of South Vietnam.  This area had never been occupied by U.S. forces until our arrival late in November of 1969 by air assault.<n> <n><n> <n><n> While scanning the treeline I saw a saucer shaped craft flying above the trees.  It tracked slowly from south to north and as I followed it a dome-like structure came into view sitting on the side of a hill. In the view from a 1969 vintage starlite scope any light source appeared green.  The dome slowly pulsed and as the saucer approached, it appeared to enter the dome, no details were discernible, only that the saucer disappeared into the dome.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I continued to watch, and sent the second guard to get the battery commander, an artillery captain (Captain ((name deleted))).  As I watched, the saucer, or a second one that was its twin, left the dome and &#34;launched&#34; into the sky.  About that time the captain arrived and I said &#34;Take a look at that sir.&#34;   He did, watching for five or six minutes then he straightened up.  &#34;What should we do sir?&#34; I asked.<n> <n><n> <n><n> He replied we were to do nothing and no report was to be written up.  I watched the dome all night, it continued to pulse, but when I left guard duty a few hours later the saucer had not returned.  There was never any discernible sounds, I listened for the &#34;whomp, whomp&#34; of a chopper or the sound of jets and never heard anything.  I mentioned the incident to the guard releaving me, but he was unconcerned as long as it &#34;Wasn&#39;t VC&#34;.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The following night I took a look through the scope to where the dome had been the night before, but it was gone. I&#39;ve never reported this other than to my captain.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date in December 1969 is approximate.  PD))<n>
12/15/69 16:00|Glenmore|LA|Circle|15/20 sec|A very clear sighting on highway U.S. 165 in Louisiana north of Oakdale near the small town of Glenmora in 1969.|10/31/03|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/032/S32535.html|7|ndxe196912| A very clear sighting on highway U.S. 165 in Louisiana north of Oakdale near the small town of Glenmora in 1969.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was a clear bright December afternoon, with clear blue sky, unlimited view.  We were driving north on U.S. 165 from Kinder toward Alexandria, La. We had left the town of Oakdale and was about seven miles north headed toward the small town of Glenmora, La.  We were just chatting and I was looking out the window to the right where I was seated in the passangers seat.  I felt very funny all over as if something were wrong.  I looked forward and saw a very bright silver object hovering over the highway about a mile or so in front of us.  At first I didn&#39;t beleave what I was seeing was real but I saw that all of the cars in front of us had pulled off the highway and stopped.  I reached for my camera, a Canon QL Pellex, I had a lens on it that was for close in shots.  I was watching the object as we pulled over and stopped, attempting to change to my 135 telephoto lens and get out of the car to take pictures. (I WAS TOO LATE)  The object was hovering at what appeared to be about 400 to 500 feet directly above the highway.  The craft or object pevited from level to about 30 deg.s up on the right and moved at a very rapid rate to about 1500 to 2000 feet, stopped, leveled and became stationary.  The object did exactly the reverse and moved back to the level position over the roadway.  The craft or object glinting in the sun, did the same to the left as it did to the right.  Each time it moved it stayed for only two or three seconds in each position.  It then moved back to the level position over the highway and repeated its identical movement to the right once again.  It moved back to the center over the highway and paused, it tilted to a position of about 45 to 60 degree angle to the up side to the left.  The craft accelerated from zero to completly out of sight is only in only one second. The acceleration was unbeleaveable, the craft was visable for the first what appeared to be 10,000 feet as it became fainter and disappeared.  I was in the Air Force at the time and I was on leave before re! porting to my new station.  I never reported the sighting to anyone before now.  I do not beleave in UFO&#39;s or abductions by anyone from other planets.  I do not beleave that anyone from other worlds have ever lived here or visited hear.  I think we have developed these objects ourselves or they are the deamons of saton attempting to fool people.  What I saw was real in my mind and all who saw it, but it could have been deamon fooling all of us at the same time.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
