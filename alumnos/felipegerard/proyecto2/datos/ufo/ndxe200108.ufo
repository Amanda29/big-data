It stopped again but this time,it dropped something out of the bottom of it.First out of the right side what appeared to be a white blinking object many time smaller and then about 5 seconds later a slightly larger one more towards the left side.It then proceeded to fade out slowly at first almost in some sort of sequence.Then as if someone was turning on a dimmer switch it faded back in slowly and then shut off completely.I could tell that it was quite high in the sky because there were planes flying below it during it&#39;s presentation(we have two airports in close proximity to El Cajon . By this time about fifteen min. had passed from the time my daughter first saw it.There were no blinking lights on it and there was no sound and I just remember the hair on my arms and neck standing straight up as well.<n>

Bright silver in sunlight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Not a flying object, but grounded stationary on top of mountain range immediately north of Dallesport, Wash., southern Klickitat County, visible as bright sunlit reflection from The Dalles, Ore. (to south across Columbia River). I noticed object because of the glint of sunlight, and viewed it through binoculars because I am familar with terrain and did not know of any road reaching that point. Object located on summit of range in very rugged terrain. I have since checked on maps and can find no road to location. Object was still very distant even with binoculars, but looked like a large silver, triangular structure, much too big for a tent. I attempted to set up a spotting telescope, but by the time this was in place the object was no longer visible. I&#39;m curious whether any other sightings of anything unusual this time and location.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((FOLLOW-UP COMMUNICATION))<n> <n><n> <n><n> ...I&#39;ve been familiar with your organization for a long time. I haven&#39;t reported this earlier because I&#39;ve been trying to decide where to go with it: I planned to hike to the site initially, but Sept. 11 came soon after and I had my hands full getting my job done.  But the sighting has been nagging at me, and I still plan to hike up there to see if I can find any imprints before the spring grass starts to grow.  (The area is upland pasture -- very few trees).<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I checked the site through my spotting scope after whatever had been there was no longer there, I noticed a small plane crossing east to west close to the hillside -- the plane was closer to my vantage point than the object had been, but even so the plane was very, very tiny through the<n> <n><n> spotting scope. Yet the object had been relatively larger, even though farther away.  This means it had to have been at least as large as a trailer or small house. Yet no roads up there to bring in a trailer, and houses don&#39;t vanish within the space of an hour.<n> <n><n> <n><n> If I do hike into the area, I&#39;ll let you know what I find out.

8/30/01 18:00|Vancouver (Canada)|BC|Cylinder|4 mins|A black cylider hovered over Vancouver in broad daylight.|11/20/01|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/019/S19932.html|9|ndxe200108| A black cylider hovered over Vancouver in broad daylight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was Thursday. I had just finnished a day of set up for the &#39;Molson Indy Vancouver&#39;.    I was walking to a friend&#39;s place to drop off her work pass and shirt for the Indy weekend, as she lived only eight blocks away. The time was between 5:30pm-6:00pm, as I recall, the day was still bright and sunny. I was heading south on Main street, between 5th ave. and 6th ave., when I noticed to my left a black rectangular shape in the sky.  It had the dimensions of a doorframe although I perceived the object to be cylindrical . Like a piece of black pipe standing on end, the object floated motionless in the eastern sky. It&#39;s elevation was about 30 degrees from my vantage point on the street and perhaps 1 km. distant, (maybe 100 meters above ground). I estimated the size of the    object to be about that of a minivan. There was no perceivable sound. There were no surface features. I stood watching as I waited for the crosswalk light. Traffic was busy, as normal, but I saw no one else observing the black minivan in its time-suspended nose-dive. I am 34 years old, I am no fool, and this was unusual. I always try to maintain an acute awareness of my environment, often with suspicion and scrutiny when curcumstances warrant it. I am also a big believer in a universe teaming with life. What spooked me the most about this encounter was that I had completely forgotten what I had seen. Even when passing the same spot on my way home, not ten minutes later, I didn&#39;t look to see if it was still there. It wasn&#39;t until October 21, when I caught part of a documentary on the &#39;Space Channel&#39; about U.F.O sightings, did it all come back to me. Similar reports of objects have been photographed and such an image jogged my memory. Apparently an object of the same description hovered motionless over a U.S. town for 3 days.<n>

Witnessed by Astonomy tutor .|11/20/01|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/020/S20038.html|11|ndxe200108| Several spherical lights clustered together and moving independently in the SE sky.  NOT STARS.  Witnessed by Astonomy tutor .<n> <n><n> <n><n> As a former Astronomy tutor at the University, I went outside almost every night this summer to have a cigarette and enjoy the night sky, My roommate and myself watched Mars move across the sky over the summer months.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were used to seeing the hororscopial constellations moved across the sky through the night and see a changing sky &lt;P&gt; This particular night, I went out rather late in the evening- around 1 am. My porch faces South where Sagittarius (shaped like a big teapot)  was pouring her tea and Scorpio was setting in the west.  As I looked South and about 30 degrees above the horizon, I saw clusters of stars moving though the clouds.  I had to really concentrate to figure out what I was looking at.  I counted 11 in one clustered area which made me realize that it just wasn&#39;t possible to, by fluke, have &lt;I&gt;That&lt;/I&gt;  many planes in the sky (at one time) AND in such a close proximity! &lt;P&gt; I woke up my roommate and brought him outside to get a second opinion.  Then I realized I could try taking some digital photos. My shots showed clusters of very bright star like and cigar like lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We both agreed it was unusual and probably unlikely that so many places could be in one area of the sky at once.  We never saw more than three planes on the sky before and this night we saw 15 to 30 of them! &lt;P&gt; I couldn&#39;t find my upload cable for my camera, so I just left it for months.  I told a few people, but I didn&#39;t really want to report it as UFO reporting is bit embarrassing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> &lt;P&gt; Anyway, I happen to live in a place that would probably welcome the story.  Belleville, Wisconsin...a city that claims to be &#34;The UFO Capital of the World&#34;.  Or at least they take on that claim as a motto for their fall --UFO Festival.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This year I took my daughter to the parade and then to the children&#39;s games at the local school.  One of the friends I told my story to, retold it to a reporter at the festival who found me and asked for an interview.  She asked me to email her my photos, which made motivated me to find my camera cable and upload the photos.  So, it wasn&#39;t until 2 months later that I actually looked at what I photographed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> &lt;P&gt; They are good pictures, although I wish they could have captured the numbers of lights that we saw with our eyes.<n>

The entire event lasted about 5 minutes.<n>

Just a triangle arrangement of lights, moving very slowly.  If you were outside you couldn&#39;t hear them, but inside the house the walls were vibrating.  Tonight all I heard was the hum of them going over and it only lasted about 30 seconds or so.  I didn&#39;t get out of bed fast enough to see them.  But the sound is so unmistakable I knew what it was.<n>

We were travelling in our car, &amp; both noticed it immediately as it crossed in the distance (unsure how far) from left to right in front of us. What caught our attention was not only the light (pink but slightly iridescent as well) but the movement on slight trajectory upwards before veering up and away on an impossible angel before disappearing. We were just about to crest a hill in a dark area slightly north east of the City of Pembroke. We were coming from the Province of Quebec &amp; had just crossed the first of three bridges that span the Ottawa River. The island we were on is known as Morrison&#39;s Island &amp; the light may have been out over the next stretch of river. When it veered away it was in a direction away from the city (north west). We didnt say anything to each other until it was gone. My wife noticed me leaning ahead as she drove and watched as well. She then asked if I had just seen what she had. There were no other possible light sources, reflections etc. There was another car ahead of us. They must have seen it as well.<n>

I was nearing the area walmart, and was in a fairly commercial area, there were several cars infront of me, and several behind me. I looked twards the southwest, which is tward the walmart, and I noticed what I thought was an Airplane from the local airport. it had lights on it, just like a plane, but as it got closer something just seemed out of place, it was traveling very fast, and its shape just didnt look right, it was still far away, but getting closer to me and was going at a very rapid pace. I watched it and tried to keep my eyes on the road so I wouldnt crash into anything. I realized that it was definatly not a routine flight from the airport, and it was coming from the wrong direction, it was now flying directly twards my car from the right side. it had a total of 5 lights on it, it had a blue light on the very front of it, a white light just below the blue one, 2 white lights on either side, and a flashing light in the center of it. as it flew directly over my car, I slowed down, and I noticed other cars in front of mine slow down also, so I know I was not the only one who saw it. It finally passed over my car, and I could see it out of my drivers side window. there was no sound at all except for the cars passing by, I could see the shape very clearly now, It was totally black against the moonlit sky, it was definatly triangular and was wide in its shape, the back had no indications of exhaust, there was no smoke either, the back was concave in shape looking sorta like a bomerang but more triangular. I could see only 4 lights on it, the 3 white ones, and the blueish white flashing light in the center, as it passed by, I was shocked when a second one quickly followed the first same shape and same lights. They both were moving at the same speed, and same height above the ground, they seemed to be seperated by about 1000 feet. and couldnt have been more than 1000 feet above the ground there was no sound, and they were moving very fast probably above 300 to 400 mph. I lost sight of them above the top of a hill, and I never saw them agian.<n>
8/29/01 18:00|Omaha|NE|Triangle|30 - 45 seconds|Black, triangular shaped observed over Omaha in daylight|10/12/01|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/019/S19338.html|19|ndxe200108| Black, triangular shaped observed over Omaha in daylight<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was traveling on Crown Point, just where it connects to Blair High Road. The direction of Crown Point is curving roughly South West (SW), and when stopped at Blair High Road intersection, you are facing just about SW. In the distance I saw a black shape moving through the air almost directly eastward. With many years of Air Force experience and familiarity with the air traffic patterns of the area, my immediate presumption was this had to be either a dark colored B1 or possibly B2 bomber heading in for a landing at Offutt AFB. Then, to my utter surprise, the object &#39;banked&#39; giving me an edge on view...and what I now saw was a very long, narrow angled black triangle. Having seen number of 747s at that distance, I would estimate it at about that length. It was clearly not the shape of a B2, which I have seen in daylight and night flight configurations. It was not a B1, first, because the only time it&#39;s wings are back in a &#39;delta&#39; type configuration is when it is flying at high speed (which this craft was not), and second, because the shape was way to narrow and triangular. I determined to stop and keep watching this craft, but I first looked down to my Van&#39;s clock to see the exact time...and when I looked up, the craft was gone.<n>
8/29/01 15:45|Oil City|PA|Changing|20-30 minutes|20 minute sighting of balloon-like objects in broad daylight  by at leat 15 witnessess|7/16/03|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/029/S29526.html|20|ndxe200108| 20 minute sighting of balloon-like objects in broad daylight  by at leat 15 witnessess<n> <n><n> <n><n> A beautiful clear blue summer sky with a couple of low, small, white, puffy, clouds was the background for an unusual sighting of unnatural objects. I was sitting in the playground in front of my apartment about 3:00 one August afternoon, while two of my children played with several neighbor children on the playground. Several adults were there, including the supervisor of the apartment complex and a contractor, who were working on plans for redesigning the playground. I called the children&#39;s attention to what I thought were parachuters coming down. The adults heard me and also watched the objects. This event was unusual in itself because there was no airport nearby and the terrain was a river valley surrounded by wooded hills. There were 4 white shapes moving in a downward, irregular, floating pattern.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There were several jets passing by very high in the sky at the time. We lived in a busy flight path area, with jets passing overhead very high, very frequently.  At the time I thought that these &#34;parachuters&#34; had come from one of these very high jets. Another thing that struck me as very unusual, because I thought parachuters leapt from airplanes, not jets. The jets were too high to see clearly, but the jet trails were clearly visible.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As we watched for several minutes, waiting to see where they might land, I thought that the behavior of these &#34;parachuters&#34; was unusual. First, the area I lived in was heavily forested and sparsely populated, so nearby landing areas were not numerous. But then as we continued to watch, some of the objects stopped descending. This in itself could have been explained by the use of what I refer to as &#34;half parachutes&#34;, the type used for stunt skydiving, but they seemed to hang in the air longer than you would expect, even of those types of parachutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The kids lost interest after a few minutes and went back to playing. I kept observing the objects, because I was struck by what I saw as inconsistencies in the behavior of these things. As I observed the objects seemed to change shape. When they were higher up, it seemed the motion was of a &#34;half parachute&#34; with someone swinging on the end of the ropes and causing the parachute to move in irregular motion. As the objects descended lower, they looked more like huge white balloon type objects, changing shape, and moving as though tumbling end over end as we watched. As though they were not completely filled and something was moving about inside the objects.  At first all the objects could be seen together, but as they descended, they spread out to different areas of the sky.  When I saw that these objects were clearly not parachutes, I though they might be balloons. But the &#34;balloons&#34; changed shape and were too big for regular helium balloons. And they did not act like you would expect from balloons that everyone has seen let loose by kids and soaring off out of sight. These &#34;balloony things&#34; clearly did not act like that. First they came down from very high and then stopped and some started moving up. One  drifted over under one of the puffy low clouds, and one went behind one and disappeared, then reappeared drifting off to the north, another went near a different cloud and stayed under it as the cloud slowly drifted to the south.  The last object drifted off to the south. By this time I thought we were seeing some kind of UFO and called the attention of the adults and children to look up in the sky at the &#34;UFO&#39;s&#34;. As I was watching them, I saw about 25 white dots that came out of an area of the sky high above us radiating out in straight lines from a center area and I yelled out, look there&#39;s more! Several people looked up as these objects then started disappearing and moving erratically back up into the sky, but I was convinced we were seeing something unusual. All of these that had appeared later soon! could no longer be seen. I watched one of the lower ones that had been there before the appearance of the others, drift over the top of the roof of the apartment, so I went in the backyard to see where it went.  It was just a round sort of shiny looking balloon like thing hanging in the air and moving slowly to the south. I called one of my children outside to look at it.  As it slowly drifted further away, it started looking more like a star,  shining brightly in the daytime and we both watched it until it moved out of our view over the treetops. The whole duration of this &#34;sighting&#34; was about twenty minutes or more by numerous adults and children. Nothing was reported on the local news that day of anything unusual.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We are grateful for the nice report from this witness.  We will invite her to contact the other witnesses and have reports submitted by the others who observed the evnet.  PD))<n>

The weather was clear and warm with a few wispy clouds. Observed black cylindrical object hovering motionless in a vertical attitude towards the south at approx 15:30 while kids were playing in zero G room. Pointed object out to other family members but they showed little interest. Found this reaction a little bit puzzling since the object was clearly unusual. Attempted to take a picture of it with my digital camera but even at full zoom it only took up one or two horizontal pixels and perhaps four vertical pixels. So I would guess the object was no larger than a mini minor approx 1 mile away and several hundred feet in altitude. Observed object for a good 15 minutes while walking back to the car. It may as well have been a fixed hole in reality because it didn&#39;t move even slightly. Before we got back to the car I decided to drive towards the object on the way home in the hope of making an identifiction but for some reason once I started driving I forgot all about it. I didn&#39;t think about it again until I had been home for some time so I have no idea when the object departed. Have not seen it again in the 3 and a half years since.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

She proceeded to tell me that she saw two alien saucers approach our area while waiting for the bus. She said that one of them had a sparkly light that came out of the bottom of one of the ships in a tubular shape, went down towards the ground and stayed there for about 15 seconds and came back up the ship. Then both ships left the area going away from our house. My daughter is not the imaginative type, and she was terrible, and still is afraid that something will happen to her or her family. She prayed that whole day that nothing would happen, and she cannot sleep well ever since it happened.<n>

At first I thought it might be an aircraft, because there was a bright blinking light.  I looked again at the object and it had disappeared. When it reappeared again, it blinked in a totally different spot only lower than the original spot.  It blinked again, and again it disappeared.  When it reappeared again, it had moved to a different place in the sky. It blinked again, and it disappeared again.  When it reappeared again, it was in a totally different area, but almost seemed like it had appeared and reappered in a triagular fashion.  Finally, on the last flashing, it seemed to move yet again, and totally disappeared from the sky.  I know it was not a plane, nor a satallite!<n>

Called my daughter downstairs for her to have a look at it. We could see red,green, and blue flashing lights, the object seemed to stay stationary, with binoculars the shape seemed to look like a narrow triangle.The object did seem to move higher in the sky as daylight approached. As for distance I feel it was far enough away, roughly the size of a large star.

I witnessed it changing directions and speed several times before leaving the view of the moon.  The object appeared so small that a shape was not visible until it appeared to lean to one side where the lighting changed to reveal a triangular shape (as if it had wings).  When the object looped around it would cover a distance of about one 30th of the view through my telescope.  It turned 3-4 times and leaned over once over a period of about 10 seconds before leaving the view of the moon.

It was disc shaped. There was a golden yellow light in the very center. It was flying very low, about 100 feet above the tree tops. It was in sight for about four minutes, due to trees blocking the view. I had assumed that discs were silver, and the triangular ones were black. It was rather large. I would guess it would take up about 1/2 an acre if it landed. It DID make a sound. It sounded like a pulsing jet engine. It wasn&#39;t particularly loud, however. There was a lot of air traffic last night. Particularly high flying, fast jets. Also several satellites passed overhead between nine pm and 11 pm.<n>

The object was traveling at a speed that would equal, but not exceed that of a commercial airliner. What caught my attention was the fact that the object had atleast 10-12 white lights and 2 red rotating beacons located both fore and aft of the object. I happened to be looking at the moon at the time with a set of binoculars that I had just cleaned, so I was able to zero in on the object. Most commercial airline traffic that crosses this particular airspace does so in a south to north path at approx. 35,000 ft. Local air travel to the Chesterfield County Airport crosses my property from east to west, but does so at altitudes of approx. 500ft. on approach. Chesterfield handles small private aircratft as well as some business jets.<n>

There was a long narrow object silver in color with what appeared to be windows.  However there appeared to be no wings or tail.  I would describe this as a long cigar shape. It seemed longer than most jet liner fuselages.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I proceeded to rationalize this away thinking that I could just not see the wings. I thought that the lighting made them blend against the sky.  For that reason I did not tell my friend about it.  I looked at it for only a few minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I since have thought about it and realized that I would have seen any wings.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The sun was high in the sky and I would have seen the shaded bottom of the wings not to mention the engines. Also there are two major airports near the area. So jet noise is common.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Background: I am 67 and retired.

It had red lights that moved but they moved verticaly from what appeared to be the top center to the bottom.  After viewing through binoculars I could see the red lights were slightly off center. The craft had what appeared to be windows in the domed center and there were lights on inside the craft.  I could not make anything out inside the craft. Although barely audible I could hear a faint humming sound.  The craft was moving slow and at times hovered for long periods of time over one spot.  It moved towards the direction I was standing but then started moving sideways instead of forward. The area this took place was in the country over a field of soy beans.<n>

As I&#39;m smoking,I&#39;m looking out into the open straight ahead and all I see is a mall parking lot and my apartment building parking lot.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I went for a sip of water,my head slightly tilted back and my eyes were pointed sort of at the sky.  Right then a green ball of light eminated in front of my eyes. There was a slight cloud coverage and I could recognize a light green haze around it.  So I kept looking on and it started to move to my left and there was no sound and it moved in such a straight line.  It started to accelerate and it disappeared leaving a green trace of light and I have seen lots of planes and this was definately not a regular plane.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When it moved to my left it moved horizantly and not on an angle.  I have seen shooting stars and they go by really quickly and they look white and they don&#39;t go by horizantly or slow enough that I could describe what it looked like.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This has been my first sighting ever and it was really exciting and chilling.<n>

I live in an area where privet airplane traffic fly right over the house in route to or taking off from the Danbury airport.  I watched kind of surprised, it was foggy; nevertheless you could see the bright white flashing light fine, I thought it was an airplane. This went on for about eight to ten seconds. Shortly thereafter the sky lit up there were flashing white lights all over the place sporadically and extremely fast then at one point throughout what was happening they were sequential and lighting up all together diagonally. I called my wife upstairs she witnessed the spectacle for about ten seconds. Then like nothing happened they were gone. I don&#39;t know, I know I&#39;m not crazy I&#39;ve never seen anything like this in my life. I took a ride in my car to see if others witnessed what I had, there were plenty of people out however all were just going about their business. My wife calleed the Danbury Airport She actually talked with someone in the control tower, she was told there were no aircraft in that location at that time. There was one aircraft in the sky located at 180°.<n>

Today (8/27/01) when I stepped out my door I first looked at the eastern horizon and noticed the planet Venus.  Then I turned towards the North and noticed a very bright light high in the NW.  Odd because I knew there were no planets in that direction, and no stars that bright (about 2-3 times the brightness of Venus).  My first thought was should I go back in &amp; get my binoculars, or just proceed towards work?  I went back in and got them.  They are Orion 9x63.  With them I expected to see only a point of light, as that is all I could see with my eyes (an apparently very bright, motionless star).  But I was suprised to see a disc.  The object had a visible diameter which immediately told me this was not a star (nova or otherwise).  I became immediately interested.  The color was pure white and very bright.  No details were visible within the bright image and for awhile no details surrounding it.  I kept watching debating whether or not to call my brother (hoping to get a triangulation) and not wishing to take my eyes off it when there was a sudden change.  I noticed the emergence of a &#34;puff of gray smoke&#34; off towards the northerly direction.  Inside this thin vaporus and expanding cloud were a number (6-12) of swimming points of light moving somewhat erratically in the same direction (generally northerly).  I then moved closer to the house and supported my arms on a step ladder to steady my view and the same event happened again, thoug the &#34;puff&#34; moved generally south and again about the same number of points of light moved off in that direction.  They did not seem to move off with any great rapidity.  The small points of light seemed to have variable brightness to them (some were brighter than others).  They did not seem to move with any purpose, but somehwat sluggishly and randomly and even seemed to slow somewhat the further they got from the bright disc, which never changed position or brightness the entire time.  Now I! really wanted to call my brother and get a triangulation, but just as I was about to do so the entire event ended with the abrupt fading of the entire scene.  Not fading, cutoff.  It just disappeared. The morning was calm, and partly cloudy.  The event was seen thru thin clouds perhaps at 10,000&#39;.  The object was above these clouds the entire time and did not move while the clouds slowly moved in a generally ESE to WSW direction.  Knowing the two locations I stood at to view this event I later used a compass and plumb bob to find the horizon coordinates, which I estimate to be the following: Elevation: 72 deg Azimuth:  300 deg (NW) During Civil Twilight I have observed balloon flights from my house quite often.  This was not a balloon, at least not a hot air balloon.  Hot air balloon are easily identified and are usually accompanied by noise when the fuel is burned for lift.  Even at high altitued one can detect the flare event from from the burn.  If it was a weather balloon (or some reasearch balloon from the University of Alaska) then I would also expect it to have changed position somewhat during the 10 minutes I observed it.  I noticed absoultely no change in position.  There was also absolutely no noise during the entire event.  If it was a balloon venting at high altitude (accidental surface rupture, or deliberate puncture) then I do not understand why the bright central disc did not seem to change position or brightness during the &#34;release event&#34;.  I also do not understand why the entire event just shut off so suddenly. Thought you might find this interesting.<n>

As I was star gazing I noticed this star to move in short quick moves repeatedly stopping and pausing still between each short quick swift move. The pauses lasted about 30 to 45 seconds. This was very unusual to me so I continued to watch it for aprox 1.5 hrs. When making its moves, it would instantaneously changed directions from left to right or up and down moving in straight lines. It also moved in half circles. It gradually worked its way in a northern direction. When I looked at it with binoculars, it was mostly fuzzy and blurred from the bright colors. After focusing the long-range binoculars the best I could, I made out a few physical characteristics. The illuminated rainbow colored panels making up the diameter of the object and most of the height. The colors slowing rotated around the object. This was not a star, with out a dought, this was a solid mass object near the atmosphere. I&#39;m assuming it was just outside the earth&#39;s atmosphere. The colored lights which appeared to be panels where just bright enough to blur out the rest of the shape. The position and placement of the colored panels made up the horizontally sliced cone shape that I could best make out. Were there any other reports on this ???? please reply..... Im must get some conformation about it before I&#39;ll tell to many people.  I&amp;#8217;m having trouble getting anyone to return my calls. (UFO agency&#39;s, air ports haven&#39;t called back) WAS THIS A SATILITE????????? Please reply<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Same witness as for preceding report.  The description is consistent with what a person staring at a twinkling star will report.  PD))<n>

It was the most unusual thing in the night sky I ever seen. It moved back and forth and stopped repeatedly gradually working its why north. Over Martinez to Benicia then over Vallejo and keep going north ( See yesterday report for more detail and description). If I can just get someone with a consistent sighting people wont think I&#39;m nuts. Did the Navy or Airforce seen this unusual moving thing. The way it moved was not consistent with any Airplane or satellite Iv seen. No helicopters fly that altitude. What was it ? Did any astronomers see it. I woke one neighbor to witness this and she thought it might be new technology in weather monitoring equipment. I need answers so people won&#39;t look at me like a fool when I tell them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Reports is not inconsistent with the sighting of a twinkling star.

Moving south to north, observed due west of me, and I am east of Woodinville.  Range of observation, hold your arm out at almost a 45 degree angle, spread your fingers, observed from tip of pinky to tip of thumb, and it took about .5 seconds to cover that span of the sky.  Trees were obscuring any more of it&#39;s trajectory.  What made it look different was the slower speed (most shooting stars I have seen are maybe a tenth of a second), and the illumination looked like maybe a landing light on an aircraft.  It was quite bright, as the night sky to the west of here is not that dark because of city lights, yet this meteor-like object was easily visible.  The tail would be about the width of a finger at arms length.  Color was headlight white, yet not as white as a halogen type light.  In the past, I observed the falling pieces of some satelite over Seattle several years ago.  Those were burning with a green glow, and seemed to be falling slowly, from north to south.  The falling pieces were visible for several seconds, and were obviously much slower than meteors.  This current sighting was pretty fast, and most likely a meteor, but it was certainly a bright one.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Other reports received via telephone.  PD))<n>

The light was at least 5000 feet minimum, and the red color was of a quality i&#39;ve not seen before. There was no strobing etc., just a solid red that was very vivid and unlike any conventional aircraft lighting i&#39;ve seen. We had pulled over to establish if the light was stationary and it was. I could say with confidence this wasn&#39;t a star because it vanished after we drove out of tree cover. We watched this light for approximately 10 minutes. I have submitted this report based on the report given on jeff rense 9/11, even though i wasnt going to report this, in light of other reports i thought it would be helpful since the first thought is military based on current events and we witnessed this light on 8/26.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  The planet, Mars, would be in the southwest sky at 2230 hrs., and it would appear to be red in color.  If the witnesses did not see TWO red objects in the southwest sky, I conclude that they probably were looking at Mars.  PD))<n>

It had a rich gold color and moved at a constant speed.  It looked as though it had a halo just above the light but at a slanted angle (about 45 degrees), just around the tip of the light, but the &#34;halo&#34; was very vague and my friend didn&#39;t see it too well.  My friend and I noticed when it started getting distant it looked as though it was droping something, like pieces of it were falling off and then fading away (like little gold drops).  We first thought it might be a flare fizzing out, but since I live in an urban area of Phoenix there are very rare instances where military jets fly over dense areas of the city and I don&#39;t remember flares being gold color and traveling at that speed.  We thought the light was going to fade out but it didn&#39;t, it kept a constant speed (a little faster than an aircraft.)  There were no sudden speed increases or change in course.  My friend suggested it might be a meteor, but from what I know I don&#39;t think it was.  It was too slow for a meteor and too fast for an airplane.  I looked for blinking lights but it had none.  There was an instance where we thought it disapeared because the light faded away, but it came back and then it finally left our line of sight.<n>

We watched and about 10sec later a bright light appeared forst looking like a very bright star and then burst into a large bright light like a flash bulb in slow motion and then retracted and went dark, about 3 or four seconds in time. We continued to watch and about 10 seconds later it happened again in a straight line up but only a short distance from the first burst, a third burst came again in about 10 seconds and again in a line with the others. Several seconds passed ( 20, 25 )and it burst again in a straight line with the others only a great distance from the last, again in about 20 seconds another burst but back and right to the orginal line and the final burst east to west about 30 seconds after the last and twice the distance between th fourth and fifth.<n>

It was very shiney and metallic like chrome, very reflective. It was about 20ft long and about 15ft wide. It looked almost identical to the UFO shown in the Disney movie, &#34;Flight of the Navigator&#34; only it was smooth over the top and not humped. It appeared to have no seems and had no identifing markings on the outside.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It flew completely silent and did not interfere with my Camaro&#39;s operation.

At first, I thought the objects might be large birds, but as they neared, I could see no wings, nor did they seem to act like birds.  They were in a close group.  I turned left (south) on Washington Blvd., went one block, u-turned, and parked the car at Diamond Oaks Blvd. and Washington Blvd.  We both got out of the car and continued to observe the objects. There were six objects, all oval-shaped, no sound, and were maneuvering in various patterns, close to each other.  At the nearest point to us, they were approximately 75 to 80 degrees above the horizon, i.e., not directly overhead.  These objects moved under their own power and performed fascinating maneuvers.  For example, they formed three pairs in a loose triangular shape, they would move into straight lines, into a semi-circle, into two groups of three forming a &#39;delta wing&#39;, then move into a curve, etc.  Two or three times, the objects moved away from us, but then they would move in an arc, change from white to bright silver, and come back near us.  At one point, they reversed direction, but without performing a turn.  It was difficult to determine the size of the objects or their distance from us, but I had a strong feeling that binoculars would have been the perfect tool for studying these things, i.e., they were just slightly beyond my ability to see exact detail. As an experiment, my wife removed her sunglasses for a moment, and said that the objects could barely be discerned, as they matched the sky&#39;s background nearly perfectly.  But with sunglasses on, they were very discernable.  After five to ten minutes, the objects again formed into two groups of three in a delta shape, and I watched them as they rapidly moved in a north-east direction and vanished into the sky.  We got in the car and drove in the direction they were last moving, but they were gone. I have a B.S. in physics, and am a software engineer working in Roseville.  Roseville is 14 miles from Sacramento in the direction of Reno, latitude 38.45.N, longitude 121.15.W.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with this witness, and found him to be quite eloquent and credible.

It remained in one spot for several minutes, then slowly moved to the south-east, turned into a white spot and headed east at a very high rate of speed.<n>

It looked like the Space Station in regard to speed and height.  As I continued to watch, the light reached a point directly overhead and then began to glow very brightly (or appeared to increase several times in size).  I thought I was seeing the beginning of a shooting star, but then its brightness diminished to its former level.  This all took but a few moments.  Around the same time, I noticed a second light trailing behind the first at the same distance and speed.  When it reached the same point in its path, it too, glowed and then faded.  I continued to watch both lights until I could no longer make them out.  Throughout the observation, the lights traveled some 35 - 40 degrees.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We observe that the first object is not inconsistent with the flare caused by an Iridium satellite.  The second event sounds similar, but we do not know if multiple Iridium satellites can be that close in orbit.  PD))<n>

Only saw said object for less then a second before it dissapeard either behind the hills or over the horizon.  Seemed to be very large in size, about half an inch tall or so.

The lights were traveling in both directions, one or two together. We saw several of the lights make course and speed changes. The line of travel was parallel to the Milky Way as it appeared last night. During the hour of observation we also saw and heard commercial aircraft at a lower altitudes.

It is very dark outside. I looked up out the window and saw a greenish/blue ball of light shooting across the sky heading West and down. This is my first UFO sighting. I have researched UFOs almost daily for a few years and I am very excited. I know it is possible this is just a fireball meteorite but the blueish green glow looked very unfamiliar. It lasted for 2 seconds and disappeared. It started about 2 fist lengths (with arms out) from the West horizon and went west and down. It was very very bright. I hope others have seen this. If it was high enough, people in the California Valley probably saw it also. I live at 3,400 feet elevation in the Sierra Mountains near Reno.<n>

I was standing on the side of a road beside a field when my neighbor pointed out a, what looked like to be, even though distance was hard to tell at 8:50 at night, so I had no idea how big it was, a flying object. It was going diagonally towards the ground, in my view point, what looked like a southernly direction. While it was doing this, it was changing from a white, to a dull green, to a dim light blue, to a dark yellow, then, it faded away quickly, leaving no trace, sound, or, smell, behind.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We are uncertain of the date.

The &#34;swarm&#34; of lights, each of apparently equal brightness and being similar in color and brightness to the star Arcturus, initially subtended a fairly small angle comparable to the apparent angular diameter of the moon. Over the course of approximately fifteen minutes, the &#34;swarm&#34; moved toward the northeast while simultaneously dispersing and becoming dimmer. By the time the lights were directly overhead they had dispersed enough for the swarm to subtend an angle comparable to at least ten times the apparent angular diameter of the moon, and each had become so dim as to be barely visible. The total number of lights is estimated at between thirty and fifty. At least five other people witness this event. The organization of the &#34;swarm&#34; of lights did not appear to be in any geometric pattern, however  they did remain roughly equally spaced even as they dispersed. At least one witness reported observing one or more lights moving in a slightly wavering path rather than a perfectly straight course.<n>

Kanata Ontario, Canada.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was a clear and nice blue sky. I always observe the sky. I was in my car and my wife was driving north. We were going to the movies. I first saw a jet plane flying high going west at an altitude of 45 degrees. I could clearly saw the white trail the plane was leaving behind. I watched the plane until it disappeared in the distance. One minute after, I look southwest and I saw what I first believe to be another plane at an altitude of 30-35 degrees.  It looked to be closer than the commercial jet plane, but you could tell it was very high. It was moving northeast at a steady speed. The first thing I noticed is that there was no white trail, and it was moving just too fast and high to be a glider or small airplane. It looked like a metallic object (commercial jet plane like) but perfectly cylindrical. Looking with more attention, I noticed a quasi-transparent dome shape attached to the top of the object (similar in texture to what you can see when the moon is barely visible during the day)and what appeared to be like a variable haze sorrounding the object. I immediately told my wife to look. Even though she was driving, she could see it too. I though then that it was high altitude balloon, but again the payload seemed just too big and it was moving way too fast. As the object became closer (altitude of 60-70 degrees) I had to stick my head out of the sunroof to look at it. I laugh to myself because the shape of the object was just like a UFO portrayed in a bad cartoon or B movie; transparent dome like with metallic base. As we were moving north, I saw one person walking at the street looking at it puzzled. Once we reached the AMC parking lot, I saw a helicopter flying at ~500m above, this gave me a point of reference. The apparent size was of a big commercial jet plane flaying high. We watched until it disappeared in the distance. For the record, I am an amateur astronomer and I hold a Master degree in engineering. I have many years of working experience.<n>

It was about 7PM and a very clear evening. Getting out of the parked car I noticed 3 fireballs in the sky. They seemed about as big as a car. What amazed me about these fireballs was their control.  They were putting on a show it seemed.  They took off in three different directions, then two of them came back in an arc and passed each other head on. I called out my neighbor, a bell telephone engineer, (&#39;m an Industrial Engineer) to watch, or witness. He was as amazed as I was. The fireballs then took off together and went at an angle that they disappeared into the horizon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Ordinarily, with this type of report, we would first ask whether the witness might have been observing advertising lights &#34;playing&#34; in the sky.

It lasted for about 2 minutes or so and what i saw was an elliptical or oval shaped object stationary and then it would dart around very fast and without any patterns.  it had purple lights on it and they were flashing on and off.  i couldnt believe what i was seeing, but i saw this silvery colored object and im not mistaken in my views.  I am a person of integrity and would not make this up im sure you guys get stupid people sending you made up stuff all the time, but this is real adn the reason i waited till now to say something is because i just found this website so thank you for providing an outlet for my thoughts and i hope this is valuable to you - dan<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

I thought it may be a helicopter at first, but when it was still in the same position after 15 minutes to a half hour, I thought it odd. The lights flashed. It was not a star, it was not a plane and it was not a helicopter. What it possibly could have been was a satelite, if they have flashing tri-colored lights. It appeared the next night in the same position. When I checked it a few hours later, it was father to the south, as our earth moved in its rotation.<n>

The object was much higher in altitude than a blimp should be.  The alititude that this object was at was at least the cruising altitude of a aeroplane.  It was bigger in size than a aeroplane by a huge amount. The object was very stationary, and had a reddish rustic tinge of colour to it (there were no obvious trails of smoke, there was no movement from this object, it was just suspended there. I told my my husband look at that up there.  Of course, he was driving the car so he had a few seconds here and there to gaze up and look at this object.  He said &#34;that&#39;s strange what is that&#34;?.  I continued to observe the object in the sky, and he continued to drive the car as we were heading back to our home in Surrey, B.C.  We turned right onto a main road (called Willingdon Avenue) this road would lead us to the freeway back to our hometown.  The journey down &#34;Willingdon Avenue&#34; would probably take us about 7 minutes to get us onto the freeway. I kept my eyes on this object in the sky, as we travelled down Willingdon Avenue. I could see the object the whole time, aside from the occasional tree, in the way.  My husband glanced over many times to confirm for himself that it was still there.  So, for about the next several minutes, I observed the object sit there in the sky and not move at all.  As we now came in sight of the freeway sign to take us Eastbound back to Surrey, I looked behind me to get a fix on the object.  It was still stationary for a few more moments.  Then the object moved across the sky at an increadible speed towards the North West. I told my husband &#34;oh my god&#34; it&#39;s just moved over.  He said &#34;where, where&#34;?  I asked my husband to pull over and check this out.  We were on the left side of the HOV Lane (2 or more person freeway lane) we slowed down and stopped the car. (Not a particularly safe place to stop) but we both wanted to check this object out.  I told my husband &#34;look up there&#34; as I had been keeping very close tabs on where the object went.  The object now appeared as a dark dot in the sky.  The size of the object at this new location (North Western sky) was about the size at the end of a ballpoint pen.  The colour of the object now was black and the shape of this object from this distance appeared to be a circle.  The object was definately a lot further away than when originally spotted. My husband and I watched the black dot in the sky on the side the freeway. We were running out of time, as we had an engagement that evening downtown Vancouver,so we left from that location, and headed home. We could not believe what we had seen.  My husband said he had never seen an object move with that speed and could not imagine any man made engineered object with propulsion capabilities such as would move a great object of that size at the speed we witnessed. About 1 1/2 hours after we got home to Surrey, my husband and I, had to get back onto the freeway to go to our engagement with family members in downtown Vancouver.  I was again the passenger in the car, and we were now travelling West towards downtown Vancouver.  I was observant of the skys, and I was talking to my husband about the object the entire journey into Vancouver.  We were near the border of Burnaby and Vancouver (but still in Burnaby at this point), I noticed a black object, stationary in the sky again.  I said to my husband &#34;honey, If I told you I can see it again right now would you believe me&#34;!??.  He said &#34;what&#34;?  I told him &#34;pull over again and get a look at this&#34;.  He then looked up into the sky, it must have been around 7:30 - 7:45 pm and he couldn&#39;t believe his eyes. It was the object again, oval shaped and very dark black background, no light or colours eminating from it, just a large oblong/shaped thing in the sky.  We watched for a few minutes.  Again, we were very pressed for time, so we took off heading for the downtown part of Vancouver. All the way driving into downtown Vancouver , I was fixed on the object which didn&#39;t move location for a long time. I observed it for a least 10 minutes more, but after that, it seemed to be getting smaller (probably either moving away (such as going south or it was moving upwards towards the atmosphere), but it definately was going somewhere.

They had already gone to bed, and I was enjoying some quiet time alone, reclining in my chair and looking at the stars on what was a fairly clear night. At approximately 11:00 or shortly after, I noticed that one of the &#34;stars&#34; in the northeast part of the sky was starting to move. It was moving slowly towards the south, increasing in brightness as it moved. At its brightest, I would compare it in appearence to Venus, but roughly 2-3x larger. It was yellowish-white in color and made no sound. After about 5-10 seconds, it stopped moving and dimmed to its original brightness. It sat motionless for about 30-45 seconds, then increased in brightness again and shot off towards the east at a very high rate of speed, again making no sound. It disappeared behind some hills on the horizon, and I did not see it again the rest of the evening.<n>

Expirienced &#34;missing time&#34; following the incident.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Around the night of August 23, 2001, I was walking my dog with my grandfather in the back yard of my grandparents house.   At approximately 9:03 PM the dog sat down and began barking quite loudly at something behind us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We turned to see a bright light coming up from behind the house.   It was flying just high enough that it didn’t touch the top of the old oak tree in the yard.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Soon the object was directly above us and I had a very clear view of the craft.  It was almost shaped like the spade suit in a deck of cards.  The craft was massive and had to be at least forty feet, perhaps fifty feet, wide and perhaps fifteen feet high.  On the belly of it were several different colored lights.   On the exact center of the craft was a mysterious dome shaped light, it glowed a color that seemed eerily familiar, and yet like nothing I had ever seen before.  Also, it seemed as though the light were some form of cross between a solid and a liquid, as if it could hold its shape without need for containment but still allow objects to pass through it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> From this light an arm, with a long needle and a wire coiled around it attached to it, was expelled from the craft.  It was from the tip of this needle that a focused beam of light shot down from the craft.  The light hit the ground still concentrated, then seemed to explode in a flash.  Then the arm was pulled back into the light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The craft then started to move forward slowly, and, being a fascinated child, I foolishly pursued it, however it sped up and blasted away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Rather confused by what we just saw, my grandfather and I re-entered the house after what we believed to be only five or ten minutes.  My grandmother, however, claimed that we had been outside for nearly a half hour and the clock in the house agreed, while my grandfather’s wrist watch told us that only a few minutes had passed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.

From the south east an orange light entered my field of view, but was moving extremley fast and I had difficulty tracking it. It crossed the sky from SE to Northwest in about 10 secs. The light was slightly larger than a star and constant.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((ADDENDUM))<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am positive that this object was not an airplane nor a shooting star.<n>

This is about a ten mile drive.  I was about half way home when I noticed three bright lights, side by side, in the sky hovering around the Randolph Grain Elevator.  I estimate the object was about 500-1000 feet in the air.  Curosity got the best of me so I turned on Randolph road and proceeded east to check things out.  As I got closer, the object was still hovering and the lights were getting brighter.  I passed the grain elevator and the object still had not moved.  I was getting closer and my cell phone rang and no one was there.  I looked later and no incomming call registered in my log on the phone.  I kept driving and then all of a sudden the object darted northeast very quickly and was gone.  I checked the flight schedule at the Central Illinois Regional Airport and nothing comes in from the south at the time.  The Airport is about 10 miles from the sighting.  There is a plane that comes in from Chicago at 11:10.  I could see the landing lights as I was stopped on the road.  I don&#39;t know what I saw as the object appeared to be an oval shape based on the layout of the lights.  The cell phone ringing and the way the object left the area is what has made me thing I saw something out of the ordinary.  Unfortunately, I have no pictures.<n>

The closer it got, the louder it became. I felt a sense of fear as it seemed to pass over the top of our home. I felt that it might crash as it was so close. I immediately got off my computer and turned off the loghts, to see if I could see anything out the window. It was a very skies and stars were very bright, buti could only hear and not see any plane. I saw a huge bright light cross from one side of the lake to another, and then the noise completely ceased for a few brief moments, only to return again, coming closer back over our home once again. I knew that this could NOT be a jet, as it would not have had enough time to turn around so soon, and this is something that jets do not do as a rule anyway. The noise continued to get louder and closer,and disappeared again just as it had done the first time it passed. This time it did not return again and no more bright lights were tobe seen. My husband at the time was on the phone downstairs, but said he had heard the loud and low flying object, he too thinking it was an extremely low flying jet. The very next day in the Lewiston Sun Journal, was a write up of the hundreds of people who had called the Lewiston police, to report the same exact thing as we had heard. Lewiston police called the FAA, and they said there had been NO jets on radar in our area at this time. BTW......all the people who called in to the police reported that it was 10:00 p.m. This phenomoner was also a big story on all the local television news reports Thur.8/23/01. No one seems to be able to tell what it was, but it was darn sure scary. Almost the same thing happened just over one year ago. It was around July 22, I believe. This time it was in daylight, and in late morning. The skies were very overcast, and I was sitting on my back porch, when I heard a plane approaching over my home.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We understand that many reports of this incident were submitted to the news media in Maine.

I THOUGHT IT WAS A STAR BUT IT WAS VERY BRIGHT. THE PREVIOUS 2 NIGHTS IT DISAPPEARED AFTER ABOUT 20 MINUTES SO THEN I KNEW IT WASN&#39;T A STAR. SO THE 3RD NIGHT I STARTING TO FILM IT, IT WAS TOWARD THE WEST.THIS LIGHT WILL BE CALLED LIGHT &#34;A&#34;. AFTER FILMING IT FOR A COUPLE MINUTES ANOTHER LIGHT FLEW UP TO IT FROM THE LEFT SIDE AND STOPPED NEXT TO IT, LIGHT &#34;B&#34;. I AM LABELING THEM TO MAKE IT EASIER TO EXPLAIN.  THEN LIGHT B FLEW BACK AWAY TO THE BOTTOM LEFT DIRECTION IN A STRAIGHT SUDDEN MOVEMENT, THEN WENT TO THE RIGHT UNDER NEATH THE ORIGINAL LIGHT A AND B WENT STRAIGHT UP SO KNOW THERE A NEXT TO EACH OTHER. THEN A THIRD LIGHT CAME OUT OF LIGHT A , LIGHT &#34;C&#34; AND STOPPED IN BETWEEN A AND C. SO NOW THERE ARE 3 LIGHTS ALL NEXT TO EACH OTHER IN THE SKY.  WHEN YOU ZOOM IN ON THESE LIGHTS THERE WAS A GREEN FLASHING LIGHT ON TOP AND A RED FLASHING LIGHT ON BOTTOM. I KNOW THAT SOUNDS LIKE AN AIRPLANE BUT THESE THINGS DIDNT MOVE LIKE AN AIRPLANE. THEN AFTER ALL THREE SAT NEXT TO EACH OTHER FOR ABOUT 2 SECONDS. LIGHT B TOOK OFF ACROSS THE SKY AND LIGHT C FOLLOWED IT. WHEN THESE LIGHT TOOK OFF THEY WENT EAST OVER MY HEAT INTO THE OTHER HORIZON AND THEY COVERED THE WHOLE SKY IN A SPLIT SECOND. SO KNOW LIGHT A IS STILL THERE WHERE IT ALWAYS WAS.  BUT THEN WE NOTICED THAT LIGHT A IS KNOW SETTING LIKE A SUN. THIS ONE APPEARS TO BE IN THE EARTHS ORBIT, LIKE A SATELIT. SO WHAT I GOT OUT OF THIS WAS. LIGHT A IS EITHER A SATELITE, OR A UFO ROTATING THE EARTH LIKE A SATELITE, AND LIGHT B CAME UP TO IT, COMMUNICATED TO IT AND SAID FOLLOW ME, SO LIGHT A LAUNCHED SOMEATHING OUT OF IT TO FOLLOW LIGHT B. AND AGAIN WHEN B AND C TOOK OFF ACROSS THE SKY IT WAS AT A SPEED THAT IS UNBELIEVABLE. THIS EVENT WAS IN THE WEST ABOUT 45 DEGREES IN THE HORIZON AND WHEN B AND C TOOK OFF THE WERE OUT OF SIGHT IN THE EAST HORIZON IN NO MORE THAN A SECOND.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I am located in North Scottsdale and was looking south towards South Mountain.  From my vantage point, I could not tell exactly how far they were from my location, but I would guess closer to South Pheonix.  The two lights did not move at all. They stayed in a stationary position, until one seemed to disappear.  A few seconds later, the second one disapeared.  About a minute later, I could almost see one again, but it never was as bright as the first time. I have served in the military, and I know what flares look like...  I can also say that this isn&#39;t the first time that I have seen these lights in the same general direction.  What is going on here? Why isn&#39;t there more exposure to this?  Or have I missed something altogether?<n>

At first I thought it soundered like thunder but it lasted longer than a thunder burst. The rumbling lasted a good minute or more. I went outside and there were no clouds in the sky and the stars were out. At this time I seen a flash of light coming from a South West direction. Many reports came in to the Lewiston Police department from surrounding towns claiming that their houses shook and they also saw lights and balls of fire. Area bases claim that no aircrafts were in the area.

I did not know what they were, but then the bottom 2 lights started moving around, much faster than any plane that I have seen.  For a while, they looked like they were almost chasing each other.  I watched them intently for about 20 minutes, then disappear, leaving only the top light.  Slowly, over the period of anout 5 minutes, it moved away.  Then, when my mom came home, I turned to look at her, then when I turned back, it was gone.  I must admit that I have not seen anything like this before, and this I could not explain. Thank you.<n>

Better late than never.  I remember this incident well because it was the evening of our 21st wedding anniversary.  My wife and I arrived home after dinner and we were walking around inside our house checking on our two children when we heard a rumbling noise in the sky near our house.  We live in one of the highest locations in the city and the evening was quiet.  The rumbling - similar to a jet engine - would last for about 10 seconds or so and then abruptly stop.  The noise got progressively louder so that it got my attention, and I walked outside but could see nothing.  The area around the house is wooded and our view of the sky to the north and east is obscured.  By the time I walked outside, the noise was continuing at regular intervals but was fading into the distance.  The &#34;jet&#34; noise sounded similar to the blast of the propane engines that are used to heat hot air balloons.  The city does have a hot air balloon festival that takes place in late August.  However, no balloonist in his right mind would fly at night, and there were many sightings of something strange, to go along with the many people who, like us, heard but did not see anything.  There was a story in the local newspaper the next day but we&#39;ve heard or seen nothing unusual since that night.  But I&#39;m keeping my eyes open!!<n>

Suddenly the one light split into two with the second appearing east of the first.  A third and forth light then appeared, also to the east as the first two lights went out. With my 25 year background in aviation as a pilot, I am sure this was not an aircraft, no dark shadow or outline of other craft could be seen at the time. The sky was dark but clear with various stars visable.<n>

I immediately found this interesting and thought it might be a formation of planes.  Through some low clouds, the craft appeared and it turned out that the light pattern was just 1 side of this triangular object.  The main body of the object was black with rows of lights on each side of the triangle, with 3 bright lights on top at each corner-top and bottom.  The object moved slowly south out of a low cloud, stopped, and rotated about 60 degrees.  When it rotated, it wobbled.  During the entire event, there was no sound (no sound louder than the crashing of the waves on the beach).  I would estimate the object to be approx. 2000ft above the water and 2500 ft off of the beach, and the width of the object itself to be 450 ft or more.  I saw this object fairly clearly and it was large enough in my field of view that I could see many details.<n>

Actually it started being visible (or maybe we just saw it for the first time) when it was very close the the big dipper.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was a blinking light in the sky. Moving at a steady pace for the first few moments. For the 1st few moments we just brushed it off as an airplane (it looked alot like an airplane would at night) but it was kind of strange--Since when do airplanes fly over Ely, Minnesota? It is the middle of nowhere! OK, maybe we could pass this off as an aiplane taking an alternate route to get to San Fransisco or somewhere. But this was before the spectactle that turned my friend into a believer in UFO&#39;s and the like.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The whole sighting lasted oh no more than 2 minutes and it looked just like a plane going thru the sky for about a minute of the two, blinking and moving steadily. But then all of a sudden it lit up (it stopped blinking and got visibly brighter), and then went extremely fast and went out of sight. We were all awestruck<n>

I witnessed this for about a minute and a half and then it dropped out of sight behind a building<n>

The object seemed to be hovering just west of Aurora Avenue North and to the south of Woodland Park zoo. At first I thought it was a helicopter, as it seemed to be hovering for over 10 seconds. But I then noticed that it had more of the contours of an airplane. I rolled down my window expecting to hear a helicopter sound, but I heard absolutely no sound from the object. The object than started flying very slowly and completely silently at what seemed to be too low of a speed for a commercial aircraft, heading southwards across Wallingford and Lake Union towards Seatac airport. I ran home to get my binoculars and try to view the object from my deck. By the time I got to my deck, the object was far away and not very visible with my binoculars.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Anonymous report.  PD))<n>

The first one then started heading north north-east, still doing the herky jerky and dimmed out of sight. Within  a minute there was another one about the same size, but this one had a smaller one above it copying the larger ones every little herky jerky motion. I grabbed my scope to try and get a better look at the thing. Wow, it looked like a shere of bright flashing light with beautiful red flashes about its exterior. I wish could describe it better, but I have never seen any thing like it. They followed about the same path north north-east. If anyone can explain this, _PLEASE, post it.<n>

I noticed that it was moving up ward.  It was a very bright white light, and I wasn&#39;t able to detect any noise.  It began to move NE and as I watched it I noticed another bright light following the same pattern.  I continued to concentrate on the first light.  As it entered the milky way it grew dimmer and then disappeared from sight.  The second light followed the same pattern and disappeared in the same fashion as the first light.<n>

We knew that the shuttle would be nearby. About 9:32pm, just before we saw the two orbiting vehicles come into view, a bright orange light flared to our SSW about 10 degrees elevation. It lasted about 3 seconds and went out. These lights continued to come on and off for 3-5 seconds at a time for about 18 minutes. They ended promptly at 9:50 pm. With me was my wife and teenage son. My wife had binoculars in the car, and with them I could see very faint strobes literally swarming in the area where the lights appeared and disappeared. As many as three bright orange lights might appear at once, but there were probably as many as five different sources.  Attempting to follow or count very faint strobes in binoculars is not easy, but it appeared that as many as five different strobe sources were present as well. The brightness difference between the stobes and the orange flares was extreme enough that I couldn&#39;t tell if it was the strobing crafts that became brilliant or if the source was just very close by.  I enjoy stargazing as a hobby and am familiar with varied phenomenon of the night sky. The appearance of the bright orange lights was in color like that of Mars, which was close by this evening for comparison, but with the brightness of Venus, about 1 to -1 magnitude in range.  The area would be towards the south side of the Army base Fort Leonard Wood, or could have been even further southwest. There was no practical way to triangulate for a proper distance.<n>

It moved very strange like motion I never seen anything like it, the second object flue the same way over the sky as the first on and it disappeared on the same spot as the first one. All we know is that they disappeared in midair no clouds in site.<n>

I was looking at the stars when suddenly I was aware that there was movement overhead.  In the brightest part of the sky, the night was &#39;black/blue&#39; in color but within that blue/black there appeared to be an object which appeared as brown (and maybe a dingy purple/brown).  There were no lights on this object.  It appeared as a shadow within a shadow.  I wouldn&#39;t call it triangle-shaped.  It had even sides, which flared out, and the backend portion was much wider than the front end.  It appeared to be heading northeast.  At some point it became harder to locate and I turned around hoping to catch it again but in this direction the sky was much darker as this is an area in which there are fewer city lights.  I could see nothing.  In terms of distance (?)I have been asked submit a drawing to scale, using a full moon as a comparison.  For this written description, let&#39;s say that if a seed from a lemon could be my &#34;moon&#34;, then my object would be twice that size.  I have thought since then that perhaps what I saw was a Stealth bomber but it seems the backend of these jets are not one single straight edge and there is a definite &#34;nose&#34;, isn&#39;t there?  And it just seems there should have been somekind of signal (light), but then Stealth bomber &#34;facts and data&#34; is just not my thing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We are not certain what the time of the event was.

This is a large flat area tapering off to a view point in a wooded area to the west.  The elevation is 5500-6000 feet. Clear weather near dusk. Visibility was about 30 miles.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were enjoying the wiew at dusk from the viewpoint,(facing west) we had been observing Navy E-A6 aircraft operating in  the area until about 17:00, a UH-1 was fire fighting south of Rimrock lake until about 20:00.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My friend pointed out what looked like a triangular flying wing with a wingspan of about 30ft, and a depth of about 5ft along its centerline.  It approached from our right (North) moving at about 100kts, it was silent and had no discernable markings and was dark grey or black in color.  It continued south for about 30 sec then turned east as if following US 12 (highway) We ran back to the campsite and retrieved a set of binoculars and returned to the view point.   (3 min elapsed time)  after about 5 minuets the whatever it was returned and re-traced its prevous route.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Both of us got a good look at it with the binoculars, while the light was poor we could see no protrusions or control surfaces.  It passes about 100 west of our position at an altitude of 6000-7000 ft (200 or so AGL) We assumed that we had seen an RPV of some type.  Both of us have military backgrounds.  Armor for my Friend and Air Defense for my self.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We walked back to our campsite and saw the thing a third time.  It was proceeding east to west along Bethel ridge at a very low 100 or so feet AGL.  We were emerging from the trees facing onto the open or &#34;prarrie&#34; area of Cash Prarrie.  The Object reached a position near our camp.  We laughed as we thought some drone operator was trying to have some fun with us.  We discussed various rude things to do in return.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The whatever it was slowed to a hover, and began a slow circle of our campsite decending to about 30 ft AGl.  it was traveling VERY slowly perhaps 5 kts it kept the pointed &#34;nose&#34; of the craft pointing at the camp as it circled.  it was moving far to slowly for areodynamic lift.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Now becomming frightened we hid in some undergrowth as it continued along its prevous course, this took it very nearly over our heads.  I laid on my belly and watched it pass to our left.  again there was no sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We took a quick survey of our camp discovering noting amiss, we then PROMPTLY packed our things and left the area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As this might damage both of us professionally I ask you not to release any contact info.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We are grateful to the witness for preparing such a fine report.

I know it wasnt an airplane but i really thought it to be a satelite.I watch it go across the horizon untill it disapairs.Then about 3 minuets after that another one catches my eye,going same direction,same pace, just a light moving acros the sky.I thought wierd i never really seen satelites like that.At this time in not really hiped up about seeing all that because i think it could have been satelites.i was more mad because ive been waiting for like 15 20 mins outside.So i pace around look at more bats in the sky looking north.Then a blue comet type fireball thats seemed to skip on water buzzed by,not super bright but it was wierd,a blue fireball type thing.i thought wow  thats really wierd,maybe im tired.But that had all my attention on the sky.Now not even a minute after i see that fireball another light goes racing acros the sky,much faster than the sattelites but same direction,exept this on was pulsating bright to very faint,that made me run in and get my cousin,she came out and looked at it to for about the last 30 seconds we could see it int he sky.My cousin even said wow that was pretty wierd and as were looking up another faint light goes in a north west direction,pulsating also but still staying pretty faint.that one was going real slow also i saw it for about 4 minuets buzz its way over the ocean.after that i didnt see anything and my cousin went inside because it was getting chilly.Also my frined came by.I hope someone here in South San Luis Obispo county seen it or someone let me know what all these strange lights are.i belive in UFO&#39;s and have been seeing alot here.

No more that 5 minutes went buy and two F-18 jets came screaming out of the east directly threw the cloud where the balls of fire where just playing giving me the chilling Idea we were not the only ones who seen the flying orbs.

It was pulsating different colors of light from blue to green to white.  I stopped our car and we watched it slowly fly north along the mountain range.  We were scared but more fasinated.  The light then seem to get bigger and bigger and it was then we realized it was coming towards us.  I got scared and turned off the headlights.  The light seemed to pause for a little bit, then it sped away at an incredible speed to the north.  Within a second it was gone.<n>

Almost immediately I observed amongst the many clear stars, a &#34;star-like light&#34; very bright, moving from N. to S. in a very slow rate of speed and high altitude. As it moved it was erratic, going in a darting pattern at times, then a very tight circular pattern, an instant dart backwards then immediately forwards, at an extremely slow rate of speed when moving forward, the reverse pattern and circular/darting very rapid. When it arrived overhead it stopped, then continued the darting/dancing/circular tight pattern for ten minutes. That is when I became aware of two more identical lights following it, which may have been there all along but I was so engrossed in the lead light. I saw two jets at a high rate of speed/high altitudes cross the area, recognizing that the three &#34;lights&#34; were much higher than each jet. At 1:30 am they were gone. When holding my hand out straight, the distance between each object was approximately the width of the widest portion of my hand.<n>

At first glance, it appeared to be a satillite heading in and eastern direction. I used a quick measurement of distance that most Astronomers use with no equipment...to judge if perhaps it was as high as another satillite trailing at the same speed behind the first. while observing these two &#34;satillites&#34; following the same orbit...a third was spotted directly across from the second one...same speed, height and heading.  To our amazement...when these three &#34;satillites&#34; crossed the path of a fairly intense star(i forget which now) the star vanished until the &#34;satillites&#34; passed our particular line of sight to the star.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is all a little hard to explain...however, there was no visible lines connecting the three &#34;satillites&#34; and they never waivered from their speed,heading, or height. I hate that people say they could have just been three satillites on the same orbit..just stratigically placed that way...as when I checked NASA&#39;s J-track site, just after they passed...I could find no satillites anywhere near our area. J-track currently shows up to 2500 satillites and their orbits, names etc. Anyone else see anything like this?  After this...without offering any of this information...some friends described the exact same thing while out trying to catch the tail end of the palaides meteor shower.  huh.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain anonymous.

We live in the country with no one nearby.  All of a sudden strange rapping occured on the outside front of my house.  It was random and moving around, a few here and there.  My husband heard them too, and laughed and said, &#34;well,it&#39;s outside, so don&#39;t worry&#34;.  I wasn&#39;t scared, but knew it wasn&#39;t &#34;possible&#34; as there is no porch here, no trees in front, etc., and thought about the girls sleeping outback and thought to myself, &#34;I bet they&#39;ll see UFOs tonight&#34;.  When they came in and told me their stories in the morning (which we just sent to you, but accidentally dated 9/19 instead of 8/19) I believed them instantly because of what had happened at the same time.  We know the timing of their event because of looking up the Iridian flash on the internet, and I looked at my clock when the &#34;rapping&#34; began.  i know this isn&#39;t a &#34;ufo&#34; sighting, but it seemed important to tell you for some reason.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Second observer to the event, the mother of one of the other two observers.

Then my friend saw a beam of light in the sky (which I didn&#39;t see).  The first &#34;craft&#34; appeared right where the iridium flash disappeared.  It looked like a disc with flashing lights of blue, violet, red, green white.  All of these light colors were on each of these ships.  There looked like one light of each color on each of these, but they mostly flashed two at a time. This craft was &#34;hovering&#34; there, sitting in one spot but sort of moving back and forth just a bit.  Then it shot off to the west very quickly.  It took about two seconds to cross the sky and disappear. Then from the west (not from one particular spot) more came, 1 or 2 at a time.  They looked just like the first one, 20-30 total (I wasn&#39;t counting so I am unsure of this).  They traveled at the same speed to the east to the spot where the iridium flash had been.  They each started to slow down right before they got to this spot, almost to a stop.  It slowly went behind the tree (I could see it through the leaves) and right when it came out from behind the tree they disappeared.  Two airplanes did fly over right after it ended, and they weren&#39;t anything like the crafts.  I&#39;m not sure if they were chasing them or not.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with the two young witnesses to this event, and we found them to be exceptionally credible for observers of any age.

At 2100 hours I was standing outside my house looking to the S.E.  A very. extreamely bright white light decended from the sky approximately one mile away.  (I have taken flying lessons and could not believe the brightness of the light.)  Then I could see some blue lights on either side of the bright white light.  The lighted object held in one position for about 50 seconds then proceeded slowly to the southeast.  There were no aircraft sounds. I called the local TV station to see if anyone else had reported something of this nature.  There were no reports at 2115 hours.<n>

My husband an I were enjoying a campfire when he asked, &#34;Is that an airplane?&#34; as he pointed to the southern sky. We watched the light for a minute or so before it zig-zagged. I said, &#34;It&#39;s definatly not an airplane. Maybe it&#39;s a meteor.&#34; We have seen wuite a number of satelites and shooting stars ansd discussed those options before discounting them. The zig-zaggin light was way too low and bright ans it was slow moving. It moved slowly, zig-zagging once and a while, from the south-west sky in a south-east direction. I stood and followed it for a moment and it disapeared. There seemed to be a faint orangy-red glow just as it disapeared. I called channel Fox Six News to report it. My hope is that someone else saw it and were as perplexed as we were.<n>
8/19/01 20:15|Grafenwoehr (Germany)||Other|45 minutes|Unkown Craft enters No-Fly Zone at Grafenwoehr Training Area, Germany, and is chased by military jet fighters.|10/27/04|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/039/S39813.html|143|ndxe200108| Unkown Craft enters No-Fly Zone at Grafenwoehr Training Area, Germany, and is chased by military jet fighters.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On the above date at Grafenwoehr Germany, (U.S. Army Training Base) a unkown craft enterded the Grafenwoehr training Area at 19 degree&#39;s over a MK-19 live fire range.  I was the Range Saftey officer at the time and a cease fire was called, due to the fact that this area is 1. a no fly zone for civilian aircraft (the Germans definatley avoid this area) and 2. cease fires are noted for exact times on the firing ranges for aircraft fire (military aircraft) and a cease fire is additionaly called frome range control 1 hour prior to aircraft entry into the training area.  The craft was the shape of a dodacheron triangle standing on end.  It appeared out of knowhere at 19 degree&#39;s off of due north, and slowly proceeded toward 190 degree&#39;s.  The craft appeared to be at a height of 800-1000 feet.  I called range control of the situation and they stated that no craft where to be in the area.  I then called TSACC (Air Control Tower) in Grafenwoer and informed SSG Murphey of our situation who was the Controller on duty.  He stated that he had the craft on radar and that he had to make some notifications and would call me back.  The craft came to a stop and appeared to hover, no sound was present comeing from the craft and it was shifting (changing colors), blue, red, green.  The also appeared to be a mirage (aura)or heat trail off to, what I guess would be the rear of the craft or the opposite side of travel.  While hovering the craft was a light blue.  After about another 5 minutes the craft started to change color blue and green and was swaying slightly side to side. Another few minutes went by and the craft again started moving to 190 degree&#39;s and then Range control calls all ranges via SINGAR&#39;s Radio and reiterates a cease fire for incoming German air craft.  From the North came two German fighter with full afterburners heading for the craft.  The craft turned red in color and accelerated to almost a blur going straight up, the jet immediatly went into a climb.  I got back on the land line with The TSACC and SSG Murphey the told me that the unidentified craft shot up from 1300 feet to about 50,000 feet in a single sweep of the radar. SSG Murphey then said that the Germans and American both attempted to contat the craft which met with negative result and that German and American Fighters had been scrambled and then that he had to go, I heard several phones in the backgroud ringing of the hook. For the next 30 minute several groups of military fighters came through the area at high rates of speed and at different elevations.  The soldiers at the range where then briefed prior to leaving that evening not to repeat what they had seen by our CO and that this action was classified from higher.  I am now out of the military and felt that this should be known. I had been a Military Police Officer for 15 years and am now a Disabled Veteran from the war in Iraq and a 4 time combat Veteran.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

My family was inside watching TV. As I sat and faced south, I noticed a sudden flash in the upper sky, way high up near the stars. It flashed a bright white that crossed the sky then was gone as suddenly as it came, like a camera flash in intensity and suddenness. I thought that was strange and kept looking to see where it had come from. It was straight ahead in the south, up at the top of the sky where I was looking. It happened again a couple of minutes later. I thought that was even stranger and called to my kids to come out and see this, but they declined.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I waited, looking for something else that might happen and it happened again and this time I saw a very bright yellow/white light moving very fast from north to south way up where the light had come from. Way high up. I watched it and had a hard time keeping track of it as it moved very fast and winked out and in, gone and then showing up a few seconds later way far ahead of where it had been going. Then, as I tried to track it,I noticed that I was seeing something with the corner of my eye, the peripheal vision. It was very faint white, like the moon in the daytime sky and I could only see it out of the corner of my eye. Every time I turned to view it with my full frontal vision, it disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I kept track of it&#39;s movement by looking out the corner of my eye and trying to catch it with my full vision as it moved south to north coming towards my house, altho it was very high up. I forgot about the other light as this one intrigued me. As it moved closer, it was still only visible thru periphial vision until it got right over my backyard and then my house and then I could see it was in the shape of a boomerang, longer on one end than the other of the &#34;V&#34; shape, and faint, faint white like whispy clouds look in the day sky but in a row along the &#34;V&#34; shape were round white lights. It moved very slowly and silently over my yard and house, but also very high up. I saw a jet moving across the sky with blinking lights and it was very tiny compared to the size of this thing that was moving so slowly and so high up. The jet was down much closer to earth and to me and was just a speck compared to this craft looming silently so high above us. I held up my hand to it to measure, and the faint white craft was the distance across of my thumb outstretched to my little finger if my hand was spread open. Maybe 8 inches in length. The jet that crossed way beneath it, so much closer to the earth and to me was the size of a beebee. I called for the kids to come out and see it, but they were too afraid to come see it go flying past our house and keep heading north until it was too faint to see anymore. It seemed that I should hear some sound, but there was no sound at all.  I don&#39;t know what the connection of the flashes of light were to this, but to me they seemed somehow connected. If it was that big and so far away, so high up in the heavens, how big was it?  It&#39;s funny about the flashes, too, because I saw flashes several years ago too, in a different part of Calif. I was driving home on hwy 101 and coming from Marin County to Sonoma County and I was surprised to see a bright flash of white light in the dark night coming from my right where there is no housing for miles. I remember thinking to myself, &#34;Huh. That was strange.&#34; and driving on into the night. A few minutes later, it happened again, and the weird part was, again, I thought to myself, &#34;Huh. That was strange.&#34; It happened 3 times in a row and every time, I had the same reaction as if it was the first time. Then, I thought that THAT was strange. The strangest part of all was that it seemed beyond my control to think that and keep on driving and not really turning to look at where the light flash came from. Just keep on driving. Don&#39;t look. And I did it like it was mind control. It wasn&#39;t until I got home that it all hit me as being really strange and wonder why I didn&#39;t stop to look and see where the light was coming from. It was also high up in the sky, I thought, but lower than what I saw in my back yard this time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date may be approximate, although the witness does not indicate that fact.

A formation of bright lights were clearly visible against the blue sky but were travelling perpendicular to the normal flight path ( we live next to the airport ). The lead object was the brightest and largest and they seemed to be fairly high up with the others strung out somewhat irregularly behind it but all were moving at a steady rate ( south to north ) until they disappeared first behind the building and then into the clouds on the northern horizen. They had emitted no sound. I had sent the wife to get the video camera and so I have some of this on 8 mil video ( erasing my daughter&#39;s daycare graduation ceremony in the process ). I still have the tape with the lead object visible and you are welcome to it. Perhaps with the right equipment the somewhat dimmer objects following could be seen<n>

Just as we were entering Ventura, I looked up in a kind of north westerly direction and saw a long white rectangular object heading slowly east.  I thought that it might have been an airplane but the length and width of it were not consistent with either a jet or a small winged plane.  That&#39;s why I kept watching it. As it was moving east, it kind of dipped on the right side and disappeared. I looked all over the sky where it had been but could not find it.  I tried to rationalize that it might have gone in to some haze along the ocean, but as we continued north, there was some haze but not enough to cover the size of the object. When I say &#34;long white narrow object&#34; I mean that the width of it side to side was about 5 to 6 times it&#39;s height.  How far away from it we were is only a guess, maybe 2 miles or so.<n>

Our bed is right in front of two windows which are diagonal to Main Street and more specifically a Church with a tall white steeple. I have been an avid star gazer since I was a teen and am familiar with the constellations, north sky circle, and appearance of planets with in the zodiac band. Being fully awake, I lay looking out the window and noticed a REALLY bright star in the sky to the left of the church steeple. I then realized this was too far north to be a planet. I waited awhile thinking it could be a plane but after 5 minutes it hadn&#39;t move. I then woke up my husband and we got out our Canon Binoculars and what we saw gave us both wicked goosebumps! The easiest way to describe it is that it looked like a wedding ring - there was one bright white light in the middle with dimmer lights on each side. There was a definite distinctive dark band separating the lights. IT NEVER moved for the 25 minutes we watched it - we don&#39;t know how long it was there before 3:40 AM. During this time the light intensity varied. At 4:07 AM - it just got dimmer and dimmer and &#34;went Out&#34; - still having never moved in relation to the steeple. The weather was clear - other stars were visible. The sky was still dark - dawn had not set in at all.  I am a high school English Teacher and my husband is in the printing business but also an avid aviation buff.  Of the two, he would be the skeptic and even he was blown away by what we saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We would like to know the direction the witnesses were looking.

Well not quite, it was too bright and moving too fast and steadily from the NW to the SE. The light moved horizontally. Not vertically, so it was then that we realized it was something of the extraordinary. As this object got further we noticed a duplicate coming back in the opposite direction which would have been the SE heading towards the NW and the object seemed to have picked up in elevation, rising further away from earth. Have you ever seen a falling star that seemed to be falling into space as if it came from earth? We both knew we had experienced something unusual. Coincidently the following night we tried star gazing again and It was then when I noticed a third light moving as the other two did the night before.<n>

We had been relaxing on the backyard deck, watching shooting stars along with my wife, father and father in law.  I couldn&#39;t think of any reason any of the &#34;non-shooting&#34; stars would be moving and asked her to point them out.  She did and said she was a little bit &#34;freaked out.&#34;  There were 3 lights about the same apparent size and brightness as an average star.  They were moving in a triangle from west to east and seemed very high in the sky.  None of the lights were pointing in the direction of travel ; they seemed to be moving with what would be the bottom of a right triangle at the front.  They were traveling slightly slower than a satellite.  A satellite would be the closest thing I could think of to describe this phenomenon but I&#39;ve never heard of satellites traveling in formation (perhaps they do?).  In retrospect I don&#39;t know if it was one object or three, it didn&#39;t strike me as a single object at the time.  Had we not been looking directly at the stars for some time we would definitely not have noticed them.  They were silent and if they had stopped, would have been blended in completely with the night sky.  Very unspectacular compared to the shooting stars we&#39;d seen all night but very unnerving.  You had to watch them for a few moments to fully realize what you were seeing.  We watched them travel across the sky for 5 or 6 minutes and they disappeared behind the tree line.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Several similar reports for the evening on this date.

It was in the shape of an oval and was a pastel red orange color.  It did not have any lights on it such as our planes have.  It was the solid pastel red orange color.  It disappeared into the night sky. I watched it for as far as I could see it in total amazement.  I have always been a nonbeliever of such things.  I Believe Now!  The only thing that it resembled in the movement would be the way a search light moves.  This was not a search light because of the color. I had been outside all evening and had not seen a search light earlier.  The object was going toward Oklahoma City the last I was able to see it.<n>
8/18/01 22:30|Barnum|MN|Circle|5 minutes|BRIGHT CIRCULAR UFO THAT HOVERS OVER CARLTON COUNTY MINNESOTA|9/19/02|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/025/S25051.html|156|ndxe200108| BRIGHT CIRCULAR UFO THAT HOVERS OVER CARLTON COUNTY MINNESOTA<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was driving north east with a friend from the Barnum fair on a Sunday evening.  We took the Mattawa exit from I35 and were headed due east.  The road probably is about 3-5 miles long until it meets another paved road at an intersection.  Anyways, we were both chatting about the fair and in a relaxed state, when I noticed due east in the sky above a large brilliant bright light.  My friend assumed it was venus, but it looked so low and to big to me.  I drove straight on the same road and we stared at it for about 2 miles straight.  Then I stopped at the stop sign and was preparring to take a left as it is the route home, and just as I stopped the Circle began to move due north across the sky, it moved quicker than a plane, and was such a bright light.  It&#39;s motion was not jerky however, it moved very quickly and fluidly to our left (north) and after 5 seconds we lost site of it due to large pines in our obstructing our view.  I looked at my friend and he looked at me like did we really just see that.  I then took the turn left, and drove on the road towards Finks Berry Farm, and on the way we still couldnt see the circle until we drove about a half mile on the road to where the trees end and a large open vield is present.  I slowed down immediatley cause to our suprise the circle was suspended over the field and looked relativly closer and lower than previously.  It remained in sight for at least 5 seconds, because once again we looked at eachother in amazement, and then back at the circle.  Suddenly the brilliantly light object shut off its lights, much like a  flash light, it was light the light sucked in quickly to a focal point, and I could still faintly make out the structure as it was a very stary night.  We both talked later and agreed that after it&#39;s lights we&#39;re cut off we could still make the outline of a metallic object reflecting light from the heavens, we saw the body of the craft/or whatever it was,, for less than 5 seconds, and then it was gone.  I didn&#39;t see it move or anything, it was! like th e lights went out, but we could still make out the outline of it, and then suddenly that just disappeared.  It was the strangest thing in the world and I still am fixed on learning what the hell it was.  I havent seen any strange objects in the night sky since, and I don&#39;t know if I want too.  Me and my pal talked about here and there throughout the school year, and our conversation always consisted of man I&#39;m glad you were with, and we know what we saw and we can collaborate that it was real.  We also both agree that what we saw was not a shooting star, because it moved slower than that and it hovered..... It was so odd, I just wish I had a camera on me, but it seems like things like this happen when we&#39;re off guard.  Just some quick facts about the area where we saw the UFO.  The carlton county area is a farm area, with many cows and other barn yard animals.  It is an extremely rural area, with woods and some rolling hills, but mainly flat.  Me and my friend also realized that the point in the sky where we first caught sight of this bright light was in a due line with the road.  Interesting thing about this is that at the intersection where I stopped, the craft was roughly a quarter mile ahead of us, and before it moved it was positioned directly over a dirt road in an abandoned area.  See the road is paved in all directions at the intersection except east, or in other words right in front of us.  This is important I believe because there are cattle farms and an abundance of dear near the area.  I&#39;d like to say what we saw was an illusion, but damnit it just wasn&#39;t, I know what I saw and so does my pal, and for the rest of my life I will never forget that night.<n>

It occurred at night so the shape was not visible. There are several large groups of trees in the area although the object rode off in the distance. It was very low when I first saw it above my window and moved much faster than any plane or helicopter. It made no sound. It buzzed my neighborhood moved to hover above some trees which I am guessing to be about 400 yards away. After a while it went off into the treeline and dissapeared out of sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Several similar reports for the evening on this date.

My friend thought it was venus, but it seemed so large and bright, and it seemed to be lower than most stars and the only star in the direction!  I thought it was the north star but realized we were facing east.  As we were about to dismiss the object as a star or planet, it suddenly darted left (straight north)  for about 3 seconds but seemed to cover a lot of ground in that short time.  We lost sight of it but then turned left as it was the road towards home anyways.  We passed some pines that blocked our view but then came to an open field and saw the bright object again.  It was hovering but then moved upwards quickly and the light totally went out, then came back on again about 10 seconds later.  The odd thing was it was a clear sky, every star was visible, so i figured it couldnt be a plane going through clouds, and the light seemed to large to just be a plane.  We watched the object for another 10 miles, and decided to go just go home cause it was now higher in the sky.   However when i got on my road i could still see the strange object, i tried to video tape it casue i had my camera in the car but the battery died about 3 seconds into taping it,  so we went in my home got my dad and drove back west down my road.  we stopped the vehicle got out and stared north northeast where the object was.  It now was a brilliant blue and red, the lights would flicker much like that of a plane, but it hovered in the same spot for 30 more minutes!!!  Plus i spotted a plane in the south western sky moving east, and it became clear the object was definately no plane.  The strangest thing about it was that it also had 3 white lights, which if connected would make a triangle.  but the triangle seemed to appear, then go away then come back once every 20 seconds or so..  we  watched it  until 11:15 and then decided to return home.  This is the! strange st thing ive ever seen and i hope to see it again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with this witness at length, and we found him to be quite credible and convincing.

We were there to observe the stars on a cloudless clear night. An object (which was a dim light, much like a dim star) appeared, it appeared to be a satillite transversing the sky from approximately NNE to the SE. We first observed the object south of zenith and 15 degrees east of zenith. As the object moved to the south we say a brilliant white light (which appeared diamond shaped) flash from it as it travelled south. From where we were standing, it appeared that the flash was directed towards us, as if looking into a brilliant spot lite. About 10 seconds later, it flashed again, the flash was brighter than any other object in the sky by many magnitudes (even the ISS is not that bright). Again after about 10 seconds a third flash was observed, however this flash was directed away from us, as it appeared that we could see the beam of it drifting out in front of the small object. Shortly after the third flash eminating from it, it vanished. Total duration of seeing this object was approximately 1 minute. We just stood there looking at each other and tried to confirm what we had just seen.<n>

At the time I was observing, the area in the sky was around the big dipper.  It was a clear night and there were no clouds visible at the time.  At fist glance I thought i was observing Mars, but at second glance I observed the light in the sky pulsating several times.  I had watched this in the sky for several minutes not believing what i was seeing and trying to make a rational decision on what I was seeing.  Within the timeline I had made up my mind due to the fact that this light was blinking in and out several times at one point disapearing for several seconds.  I then lost sight of the light when I turned and headed North on hwy 99west.  I want to be sure in what I was seeing so if there are any other people around the area of Salem Oregon who also observed this light report it as well thanks.<n>

It first appeared to me just below the top of my windshield at about a 30 degree angle above the horizon, appearing to flare up at that point to a bright yellow-white color with a long tail and sparks and small chunks breaking off. It was about half to 2/3rds the size of a pencil eraser at arms length. It dropped almost vertically to a point just above the ridgeline of the foothills, and appeared to dim out just before disappearing. While very hard to estimate distance, if I had to venture a guess I would say 5 to 20 miles, though it could have been much further. It looked to me that it very likely hit the ground relatively near Denver. (A call to the USGS for seismic cooberation was quite unsatisfying) I had my hand held GPS operating, and checked the current heading at that time as 201 degrees. I am trying to confirm if that is magnetic or true heading, but the GPS manual does not specify. It appears to be magnetic heading based on my aeronautical chart and the road in that area. The object was just slightly left of straight ahead, so most likely about a 195-200 degree magnetic heading from that intersection. Plotting this on my Denver Area Chart (aeronautical chart), the line runs nearly through Marshdale, Silver Springs, and Bailey Colorado. (If my GPS course turns out to be True Course, shift the line 10 ½ degrees to the left, but magnetic course looks right on the map). This was one of the most spectacular, low and close objects of this type I have seen, and if my small plane were not in the shop I would go out looking for evidence. It may be possible if able to triangulate or get a seismic location to find a relatively pristine meteor or space debris. I don&#39;t know who to contact about meteor impacts, so perhaps you can tell me or pass this on. Perhaps NORAD/Space Command has some info on this object if they will share it with us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Map sent by witness.

Just after passing the eastbound scanner and block signal at mile post 576 (10 miles north of Laramie), I looked out of the front window of the engine just to my right, and saw an orange fireball go straight up in the air, just beyond a rise in the terrain, and come right back down again. I said to my colleague, &#34;Did you see that!&#34; But he was reading, and didn&#39;t notice it. The object from where I was, looked like a baseball that had been soaked in gasoline, and set on fire. It resemebled the sun on a bright day, but with flames all around it. I would say from where I saw it, it was the size of an old school kickball. (I initially thought it was kids, but the area there is sparsely populated.) Upon proceeding with the train through the cut in the rise, about 3/4 of a mile further on, I looked back to the Northwest. I noticed what looked like a very bright, orange ball on the ground.  This would have been the correct location from where it had gone up in the air , and came back down again.  There are no houses or other structures there, just open field. I looked several more times, and the object at that time looked like a bright campfire, about the size of a baseball, as at this point, I was about 2 to 3 miles from it, and moving away. Since I saw this, I have looked over there to see if there could be a Ranch house or other structure, but there is just open range.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with this witness at length, and we found him to be exceptionally credible.

Then at about 4 different points in time we saw them go into patterns like geese would do, then criss cross, then go straight down, then straight up and get back into a V pattern then they would sometimes go up and totally disappear, or go down or side ways and totally disappear.  They flew in very crooked irratic lines and very, very fast.  Sometimes they would slow down.  Then all of a sudden after about 22 minutes we saw a huge fire ball that was extremely large and bright orange and red that appeared to shoot straight up and back down with a thin white tail.  We continued to see a few more traingular shapes moving irratically then all of a sudden nothing at all..Sometimes it almost seemed as if the small ones were flying off of a real large object and flying around and then coming back. They were also flying pretty low. There was an article the next day in the paper there, that said the observeratory had seen the same thing we did and also the students at the college in Laramie, Wyoming.  It had stated that if anyone else had seen these lights to call you, but no-one at the newspaper office could let us know where.  So we just came across you on here and that is why we are reporting it now.  I tryed to get them captured on my video camara, but I guess it was to dark.<n>

Then a bright, intense starlike light  was approaching from the west at a medium rate of speed.I thought this might be the lights on a commercial jet. Straining to see any blinking lights I thought &#34;where is the engine noise?&#34; I was listening for gas propellent for balloons. The bright intense light passed overhead and to the east. Still no green or red flashing lights.Then it was just gone, like it went into a black hole or something. The night was very clear and one could see all the stars including the south to north track of satellites.So for this intense light,being the size of a football field,to just disappear as though a switch was flipped off seemed impossible. I went back to get my son and binoculars to go back out.Again a shooting star and then a bright light.Looking at the object through our binoculars we still did not see any flashing aircraft lights,no noise,just motion.The white intense light,smaller though, or the same one farther away, heading in a different direction? Did anyone else see this?<n>

I traveld in a straight North to South direction and at the approximate speed that a satelite would appear to be traveling. Moments after spotting this the inteity of the light increased 20 fold. The object faded from view a few seconds later. This was fallowed by an identical object that did the exact thing. The second object trailed by perhpas 30 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Ignoring the events that reportedly had occurred over Wyoming and Colorado just minutes before this sighting, we believe this report describes an event that is indistinguishable from the flare of an Iridium satellite.  We will check to see if an Iridium could have been visible at this time.  PD))<n>

I noticed a small red light moving very slowly, at first I thought it was a plane until it stopped almost directly above where we were standing.  After about 30 seconds of staring at this object I made a comment to the person I was with, she in turn looked upward and saw said object.  This object seemed to have lights on both sides, 180 degrees apart, while it hovered above us it rotated back and forth so that these white lights made a sweeping motion in the sky.  After about 2 maybe three minutes said object moved straight up in the sky until it was barely visable and moved off towards the direction of the town of Darrington at a very slow speed until we could no longer see it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

It was a reddish yellow and was brighter than all other stars,but the same size.The reason it caught my attn.was it&#39;s erratic movement...bounced downward to the left and back to the right then to the side and back. Around 21:45 it began to move toward the south.When I saw it,itwas in the western sky at ou 25-35 degrees and later moved slwly and somewhat spastically to the southern .. at the same approx altitude. Last night the same appeared along with two others...SSW and SW...behaving exactly the same way  These observations were made from my bedroom which was dark and also from  our rear deck.Interference from city light is minimal.My wife also witnessed these events.I will be checking again tonight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We believe that the report is not inconsistent with a sighting of Mars, but that explanation would not account for the movement of the object over 3 minutes&#39; time, as asserted by the witness.  However, the object was in that portion of the sky in which Mars would be seen, and inexperienced observers frequently report that a stationary celestial body was seen by them &#34;to be moving.&#34;  PD))<n>

A round craft with 5 large lights around the outside of it, blinking off and on in a cascading pattern, directly to the N less than a mile away. It was fairly large and round, I would guess about 100 feet across. Seemed to be hovering, but weather conditions had low cloud cover that was occasionally covering craft. I asked my wife and 13 year old son &#34;what&#39;s that?!&#34; and they proceeded to watch it while I drove. The ights just continued to blink off and on until we moved out of sight range of the craft.<n>

Our view of the horizon was obstructed by mountains. The view to the North was obstructed by a building. For a period of 4 to 5 seconds, the entire section of the sky that was visible to us was lighted by a bright light whose source I could not see.  The light changed colours, including blue, white, yellow and orange, though I don&#39;t recall the sequence.   It appeared as if the source of the light was due South, below the mountain ridge, but since my view North was obstructed it is possible it originated in the North.    We watched the sky for another 10 minutes but saw no further occurrence of the light.<n>

Object appeared to have movement of some sort on the underside, similar to a tail.  Moved rapidly across the sky and dissappeared. Photographs were taken using a disposable camera.  Before sighting, a squadron of UH-60 Military Helicopters were seen flying formation towards the NE...in the direction of PDX airport. We were looking at a hawk flying when the anomolous object was spotted.  It first appeared as a glint in the sky and then straight-line movement was noted.  I grabbed my partner and directed his attention to it.  &#34;My god!  It is a UFO&#34; was his repsonse.  I grabbed the camera off the table and got 3 shots before I lost it in the trees.   We ran out to the front of the house, and looked along the expected path of the object, but it had dissappeared.

8/17/01 08:10|Fulton|MO|Cigar|2 minutes|Silver cigar over Central Missouri|8/20/01|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/019/S19033.html|185|ndxe200108| Silver cigar over Central Missouri<n> <n><n> <n><n> This morning as my sons and I were outside preparing to get in the car, I heard an unusual sound which I have in fact noticed on several occassions in the past months.  Certainly not highway noise, and while similar to typical aviation noise, somehow much more &#34;otherworldly&#34; sounding.  This is such a subjective description, but is the best I can come up with.  We live along a creek banked by steep cliffs and have a deep ravine originating near our home that opens into the creek in a break in the cliffs.  I mention this because I believe this feature can amplify aerial noises.  I will also mention that I have been an avid sky watcher for almost exactly a year now, my interest originally having been piqued by stumbling across info on the web re: anomolous contrails, aka chemtrails.  Within a month or so of reading about them, they began appearing frequently in our skies, typically the result of what I would  say, from the planes I have viewed, are military jets doing some kind of exercise. In any case, this morning the skies were almost pure blue, but typically upon hearing that unusual noise planes will appear and the skies slowly haze over... This morning something totally unexpected happened. A cigar shaped object appeared at an altitude just under the few clouds (cirrus) in the sky, slowly moving west to east.  While the strange noise was coming from a distance through the ravine, there was no sound whatsoever associated with this craft. It was uniformly silver, with no wings and no windows that I could observe.  It had no contrails coming from it.  My best estimate as to its size would be that of a typical tractor-trailer only wider.  It had the shape of a medicine capsule, therefore I would call it a cigar shaped object for classification purposes.  Within approximately 2 minutes this slow moving craft ascended at perhaps a 15 degree angle and poof! disappeared from view.  I have been thinking about it all day - it was so unusual.  Within a minute of seeing this object, a military (I assume) jet ap! peared i n the sky emitting a contrail at about the same altitude.  Back in March, I was driving near my home looking at lingering contrails and noticed a jet - traveling next to it towards its rear was a silver orb a bit smaller than the jet.  I wished to observe this by following it in my car but had someone tailgating me, so I was unable to make a turn in order to observe more.  Other than that sphere and the cigar witnessed this morning, I have NEVER seen anything like these craft before in my life and would rule out explanations such as &#34;blimp&#34;, &#34;weather balloon&#34; or the like.  I have never &#34;believed&#34; in UFOs but the sighting this morning, as well as the orb some months back, have me convinced that there are at the very least craft of whatever origin whose operating mechanisms are nothing like those the general public are privy to.<n>

Anyhow, it took a period of about 45 minutes as I watched an obvious vehicle approach and go across the foreground terrain. The headlights eventually stopped as parked. The delineation of the night sky and &#39;Popo&#39; are very clear. My Live-cam updates in a minute. Then there was a frame of a group of deep bright blue lights, a centre and 5 around it --very clear and in the same foreground distance as approximately the parked headlights. I got then one frame clear, then the next frame seemed to show a white diffuse disc shape in the same place as the blue &#39;flower&#39;. (I thought &#34;uh-oh&#34;. The next frame showed no headlights ,the 1st frame without in over an hour now, and over the area ,an even fainter glowing line visable,but still below the horizon of Popo. Then the digital signal disappeared for all but the top 40% of the view. I&#39;m stumped. Oh,,also on the noon shots of yesterday or day before, ther Were a few black dot ufo&#39;s that I mentally wrote off as possable science balloons. I love you guys.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We have had many reports of alleged, unexplained objects over Mt. Popocatapetl in Mexico.  However, we have yet to see any photographs that are convincing, and which are suggestive of UFO activity.  Most of them clearly seem to be of birds, contrails, or apparently composity photographs, I.e. presumed hoaxes.  PD))<n>

A few seconds later I noticed two more lights following directly behind the first. These three lights took the form of a slightly skewed triangle. All three lights were no brighter than an average star. The size was no larger when viewing a quarter held up at arms length. These white lights were moving slowly in a straight path for about 20 seconds and then it disappeared. I beleive the lights traveled behind a cloudy area in the sky but it never reappeared afterwards where the sky was clear again.<n>

The object was moving very slowly. The sky was overcast. 3 of us observed it: my girlfriend, her daughter and me. The disk seemed very big and very high in the sky. It came from the north-west part of the province of Quebec and was going south-east. There was no sound. I ran to the neighbor&#39;s house. His wife answered the door and as she was coming out of her house a commercial airliner flying at a high altitude was about to cross path with the object. The airplane was about the size of a 707 but the disk was much bigger than the plane. The object started to zigzag quickly to get up through the clouds and disappear before the airliner crossed path with it.  I went back inside and watched channel 740 on cable TV.

My friend and I were talking and looking out at the sea &amp; stars and there was an elderly couple standing next to us using one of those viewers mounted to the pier on a stand.  We were watching what looked like 2 airplane lights moving toward eachother slowly, one from the S &amp; one from the N.  There was nothing strange about the lights at this point.  Suddenly, the one on the right (moving S to N) accelerated and zoomed toward the one on the left.  Then, the one on the left (moving N to S) circled very quickly around the other, almost like a fast mid-air dance, and shot off very fast up to the left (the opposite direction) at a diagonal and disappeared!  The one that was moving S to N continued moving in that same northward direction at the same altitude and its original velocity as though nothing happened.  Well my friend and I both said, &#34;Did you ! see that?!&#34;, and the couple next to us quickly looked into the viewer at the area and the man said to his wife, &#34;We&#39;d better get out of here.&#34; and they left.  This confirmed that they saw it too.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was no sound associated with these objects and the color of the one on the left was slightly greenish while the one on the right had a slightly reddish orange color.  The color difference helped to differentiate and keep track of the objects as they zipped around eachother.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;d like to add that I&#39;m a scientist and have spent years playing this over in my mind to try and figure it out but I don&#39;t have an explanation.  There is an airforce base a few towns over so it&#39;s possible it was just some aircraft from there, but I haven&#39;t seen anything maneuver like this before or since.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of sighting is approximate.

It was as bright as a &#34;strobe&#34; light. Flashed directly into my face. Lasted approximately 20 seconds, then it seemed to , for lack of a better word, &#34;return&#34; to what appeared to be a transparent object. The UFO traveled in a S-shaped motion forward , moving fast and then slow. Distance to UFO from myself , well, up there where satellites roam. Observed object until treetops blocked my view.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous.  PD))<n>

The object caught my eye as I looked up at the cloudless blue sky, what puzzled me was that it must have been travelling at thousands of miles an hour as it shot from the west to the east and did not even leave a con trail. The object came to sudden halt and then dissappeared just like that, from spotting the light in the sky to it dissappearing was about one and a half minutes.<n>

My girlfriend and I where looking foward for this &#34;escape&#34; from our every day urban life, little did we know this trip was going to change our views about this world tremendously, and will rise so many questions no one could possibly answer.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We decided to go camping, we had bought our gear at cosco about a year before this event, but work was always on the way because to get days off these days you have to be really polite in asking your boss, because some corporations have a hard time understanding &#34;time off&#34;. So we finally did it was on august 2001, just a week after my birthday. We took along my father in law and his little son, my brother-in-law, and ofcourse my girlfriend.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We arrived at sequoia national park at about three p.m. and we arrived at our camping site I dont remember the exact name it was something with &#34;creek&#34;. The reception lady was an older female really friendly looking and whit great spirits, like those kind of persons that just make you feel welcome and confortable around. she gave us advice on how to avoid disturbing the natural life around us, because is so beatiful all those trees, rivers, and humidity made the place like heaven on earth.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So we pulled out our tent only to find out that it was the small two person tent and we were three adults and one child, but we where ready to sleep like sardines it didn&#39;t bother us at all in such a wonderful place things like that are easily overlooked. the &#34;neighboars&#34; next to us welcomed us and where inviting us close to their fire place since we did not have wood at the time to burn our own fire, and we politely declined since they where so many and we wanted them to enjoy themselves.<n> <n><n> <n><n> To this point everything was perfect The moon was bright only the natural light of the stars along with the burnig wood from our neighbors was the source of light which was beautiful.so at about ten thirty there where no more noices of the chattery of all the campers and the burning wood started smelling a little stronger since it wasnt burning anymore only smoke was coming out and so we decided to take our place in the tent because the day after would be full of activities. at about eleven (at least thats what time it felt like) we all kind of woke up, but didnt relly talk it was a feeling like if something was calling for our attention. but didnt know quite what it was, first thing that came to my mind was that really nice old lady at the entrance that warn us about wild life specially the bears, so I thought well we might get to see a bear close hopefully everything is ok I thought.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I asked my father-in-law wether he heard any noise &#34;no&#34; he replied. hmm.. I mumbled; well is it just me or is someone&#39;s light pointing this way, at this moment we couldn&#39;t see the source of the light because the tent from the inside is covered, but it definately got brighter almost as to where you could feel the warmth from it, and my father-in-law said &#34;yeah it&#39;s brighter&#34;, &#34;perhaps is the rangers scaring away a bear&#34; he said. After he said this the most peculiar feeling went through my body I felt heat coming from the outside, it wasnt uncomfortable heat, it fell like an actual lamp got close to my body and I told father-in-law Im gonna open the zipper from the tent to see whats going on with the light since its been here for a while. then I aproached the zipper and started to open it at that moment my girlfriend said &#34;what are you doing&#34;she said, &#34;Well dont you see the light&#34; i replied &#34;yeah I havent been able to sleep either, i feel like there is a bear or something outside. So I knew I wasn&#39;t the only one experiencing this.<n> <n><n> <n><n> then I proceeded opening the zipper. At that moment whe where facing eastward opposed to the moon&#39;s position and indeed we saw a light; there was this bright light right behind some big trees right in front of us. only It seem too close to be a bright star. and too big to be a light bulb of some kind, there picking thru our tent we stared at it I would say for two minutes, then after that the most unexpected thing happen the light moved its focus from the neighbors tent to their extinct fire, I was puzzled by this light then I asked my father in law &#34;Do you think it&#39;s the ranger?&#34; &#34;Idont think so&#34; he said. and ther this bright intense light it seemed ideal for that light to be in a football field only no football field around sequoia that I knew of. So this light just I could say &#34;staired&#34; at the extinct fire smoke, It was hypnotising to see the light and at the same time the smoke I never payed attention to smoke before but the way it extinguishes is beautiful, you can actually create patterns of &#34;s&#34; shapes and rolling into the thin air, and then in a split second my eyes where flashed by an intense flash. I dont remember exactly how it happen or when, but the light was now directly in our face, my father in law said it&#39;s an ufo. I was speechless. although I was speechless though I asked him have you ever seen an ufo? &#34;no&#34; he replied, but thats not a normal light, I agreed as well the moment it looked at us because in fact the light was looking at us. I felt so diminished I wasn&#39;t scared I just felt really diminished, Im not sure why I felt this way. As the light made that movement from the fire to our tent it felt like in a way the light was aware of our precence and it felt we have seen it as well. so in kind of a friendly way it focused back on the smoke. after that we got reall tired the light was still there thought but neither my father in law or my girlfriend wanted to coment about it, I guess we all were so confused there was nothing to talk about.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Next morning we woke up around eight a.m. the wood still smoking and then a ranger passsed by in truck and my fahter in law stopped her and asked &#34;hey were you guys the ones with the really bright light&#34; he asked. &#34;hu? what light?&#34; ranger replied. then my fahter in law explained what we experienced the night before, then she said &#34;well we dont have any lights that strong besides where are we gonna stand the light from the direction you are pointing beyond the little hill is a big drop my friend, so to even bring a light up to that hight would take a lot of long tubes to hold the light&#34; So me and my father in law glanced at each other and we knew we had to go see what was beyond that little hill, as we climbed it we  looke and those trees are about 100 feet thats why there were visible but the drop ws tremendous! no way it could of being a ranger with a lamp, that light was floating right by the tree branches and the thing that still amazes me the most is the fact that it was about twenty feet away from us!. From that day we have a more sencitive aspect as far as when people say they experience thing like that before we just assumed they were on drugs or something, but ever since that happened I am stil exited, anxious, scared, and puzzled by that event, yet I want to know...<n>

At first I questioned it to be Mars, but it began to slowly move to the rifht in shaky movements. The orange/amber object continued to move towards a a patch of trees in the foreground, though after watching it for about 30 minutes, it began swaying from side to side. Also when a normal airliner flew overhead, it made a sudden, quite agressive (about a 45 degree) turn to the left, away from the object. The object continued to move in this manner, often in almost a circular way until finally disapearing behind a large group of trees.  Also a witness, my brother&#39;s girlfriend.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We have corrected the date to August 15, which we assume was the correct date.  Also, we suspect Mars.  If a witness stares at a celestial body in the night sky for even a short period of time, the person generally will report that the object appears to be moving.  It is the result of the fact that the eyes move, giving the impression that the object is moving.  There may be other visual factors involved.  PD))<n>

Astronomers from the Colorado Museum of Natural History said it was a meteor, and from the many eyewitness accounts it would have been about 2-3 tons when it entered the atmosphere and it gave off several sonic booms.  It came to earth somewhere in the La Garita mountains.  Scientists and locals flocked to the hills without finding a trace.  All local papers reported on it for a week or two, including the Denver Post.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The strange thing is, that from NORAD it must have looked like a 2.5 ton object heading straight for Cheyenne Mountain as it was inbound.  I find it amazing that they did not track it, and could not give the museum a trajectory and velocity on the thing.  It makes me suspicious about the true nature of the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> No wonder we can&#39;t hit Mars.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We suspect that the U. S. government has technical means to detect and track all major fireballs.  The date of the incident was Friday, August 17, 2001.  Please see other reports from Wyoming for a few minutes earlier on the same evening.  We are not certain that all the events reported that evening can be ascribed to a typical meteor.  PD))<n>

As I was driving, I notice a craft with a bright red colored light on it, not blinking, and bigger than an airplane light.  The light was the predominant feature of the craft, and in the front.  The proportions were if you would take a lightbulb and attach it to a half blown up balloon.  There were other lights on the object as well, but the big red light was the main feature.  It was low in the sky, but not incredibly, but it was moving very fast.  I saw it for about 1 minute before I had to turn and head north towards town.  It was moving very fast, and quickly getting out of my field of vision, but I was still able to see it, I was still going 70 mph.  I watched it for about another 45 seconds to 1 minute before reaching Berlin, where I had to slow down, and then lost sight of the craft.  The whole time, the red light did not blink, and the object moved incredibly fast.<n>

It was dark.  We were in the car.  The car was not running.  Out of no where, a very bright light shined in the front windsheild.  It seemed to be on top of the windsheild.  It lit the inside of the car with a very intense white glow.  After watching the light not move for about 30 seconds,  I jumped out of the car thinking somebody was shining a flashlight in the car as a prank.  There was no one around.  Keep in mind that we were in the middle of the Nebraska countryside.  There was a feeling of horror that came over the both of us.  I&#39;ve told a few people about this but they think i&#39;m crazy or making it up.  I don&#39;t care,  I know what I saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I obeserved it flying NNE.  I decided to try and follow it.  I made a turn E and followed it for several blocks and it changed direction ater a minute or two.  I then turned to follow it N, and it changed direction again.  I made a final turn and I assume was noticed following it and it instantly accelerated and within less than 2 second was on the far NNE part of town.  Going in that direction it easily could be headed toward Cannon AFB, and coming into Roswell from the direction of White Sands Missle Range (SW of Roswell).<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

We were waiting for some other people to show up, and we started pulling stuff to do out of his garage.  We found a hoolahoop, and being the teenagers that were were (and still are) we really didn&#39;t use it for it&#39;s purpose.  We stood in the middle of the dead-end in front of his house and threw the hoolahoop as high as we could.  We were alternating turns, and eventually it was his turn.<n> <n><n> <n><n> He threw the hoolahoop up into the dark sky, and it came dropping back to the ground.  The thing was, my friend didn&#39;t watch the hoolahoop drop...in fact, he was still looking in the sky as the hoolahoop came a couple yards away from landing on him.  He asked, &#34;What is that?&#34;  I didn&#39;t know what he was talking about, so I looked DIRECTLY above where we were standing.  At first, I thought I saw what appeared to be white toilet paper flying high in the sky.  I&#39;m not too sure if I saw this correctly or not, but I THINK it may have changed shape/form.  Maybe my eyes were still adjusting, but when I looked harder it became apparent that I was seeing a big white &#34;V&#34;.  As I looked harder, I saw the rest of the craft...and it was a large black triangle with a white &#34;V&#34;-shaped stripe on the front of it.  It looked almost like a GIANT hang-glider.  The only problem with that solution is that Long Island is flat.  There is no hang-gliding here and there is no possible way to jump off any mountain or cliffs simply because there are none of that size.  It appeared to be roughly the length of a professional hockey rink, and it made absolutely no noise.  It was traveling from somewhere above my friend&#39;s house towards the other side of the street in a slow straight line.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My friend was like &#34;It&#39;s a UFO, It&#39;s a UFO!&#34;  He ran inside to get his mother to come out and see it and he told me to make sure to watch where it goes.  It continued to cross for about two minutes before I eventually lost sight of it in the street light.  The object had no lights, and made no sound what-so-ever.  Nobody believes me and my friend, but we are confident that we may have seen either a secret-military or an extraterrestrial ship.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of the event is approximate.

I was talking with some friends when I looked up to the West and I saw a light coming East.  This light was up very high, looked like a star. I pointed it out to my friends and we watched it. It was going East very fast, and all of a sudden when it got overhead it was going North as fast as it was going East. This light did not turn, just changed directions. When it went North it continued to move around zig zag with the very sharp direction turns. Two more lights came and joined this light. These direction turns continued as the crafts moved around. The first light went NE over Mt. Whitney area, went back and forth a couple of times. The other two stayed over the San Joaquin valley, in the North.  The lights traveled back and forth, then one came South and went SE.  I told my friends to watch the North I was going to watch the one in the South.  The two to the North seemed to be exploring.  The one to the SE went to a point and stopped.  It set there for about a minute and then it excelled in very great speed going straight up.  I  watched and it got to where it was only a pin prick of a light.  It stayed there for a while then all of a sudden it came back down as fast as it had gone up to the level where it had been, and it stayed there for a while.  The two in the North continued moving around and then all of a sudden they came South and the one in the SE joined them and they went South together over the mountains toward the Pacific Ocean - Ventura area - and disappeared.  We never did see them return.  Later at about 22:30, that night, a very bright object fell from the sky in the North, it looked like something very big had entered the atmosphere was burning.  Within a matter of minutes after this some military jets came from the East and circled around.   I am not sure about the date; it was August 15 or 16 and I am sure the year was 2001, I should have written it down. I marked the date in my mind about a week later. I&#39;ve had several other experiences with UFO&#39;s in my life.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

I had a shift from 4:00 to 8:00, and was driving out to my rural home after work one night. There are two railroad tracks along the extent of the road, and I had already passed two trains. This was unusual for this stretch of track, and I was thinking it was wierd. On the long straight stretch, I noticed another train. I couldn&#39;t tell if it was moving or not. I wanted to find out so I&#39;d know if I should speed up to beat it to the crossing. So as I approached the end car of the train, I slowed down a bit. The train wasn&#39;t moving, and I was just about to speed up again when a  kind of disc came from the bushes beside the track. It looked a little less than two feet, and was white-ish. It looked kind of like condensed fog or something; solid but opaque It was kind of glowing, but it didn&#39;t really give off any light.It zoomed out of the bushes towards the road, veered towards my minivan, and flew right over top. It scared me enough to make me scream out loud, then I sped the hell out of there! My knees were all shaky and I was really freaked out. I wasn&#39;t on drugs or anything, and I&#39;m not some wierdo who made this up. I&#39;m embarassed to tell people what I saw, cause they&#39;ll think i&#39;m crazy or something! What&#39;s interesting, though, is that a lot of other people in my community have mentioned seeing things, like wierd lights in the bushes and funny noises. There&#39;s a lot of stories about this area...I&#39;d never really believed any of them till now.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

I look up in the sky and suspended in the air approximately 50 feet is giantic device.  At first, I do not recognize this thing suspended in the air as a ufo because it does not look like other ufo&#39;s I have seen photo&#39;s of on television or in books.  Then I realise that this device is not a plane, or a jet, or a helicopter or anything I would know, and more importantly this huge thing is suspended about 50 feet in the air. And even though this ufo did not have lights as we know lights, like head lights or flood lights ect...the craft was illuminated.  As if a dull light was woven into the blackish metallic metal looking material that made up the craft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The device looks like a giantic safety-pin, with two circular points at both ends and long cylindrial tubes connecting both ends.  I become very fearful and think to myself that perhaps I have gone unnoticed by this device and I should calmly walk on to the house.  That is when 4 disc shaped objects float out of the far end of the device and approach me.  I stand  frozen as 3 disc pass very close by me and the 4th disc hazes my right arm.  As the 4th disc hazes my right arm a vibration runs through my body.  Scared I walk briskly up the drive to my house and do not look back.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate in August 2001.  PD))<n>

I think it was in 2001, not sure. The comet was visible for about ten days. As I ventured ouside to check its position, after dinner, I saw a more incredible sight! It was dusk, but still bright outside.we just had a brief thunderstorm, with lots of lightning and heavy rain. The sun was returning, and I wanted to view the comet. From here in Blackwood, Camden County,South Jersey,the comet was North by Northwest in the sky. as I looked up I was amazed by this huge cloud that was rising up after the storm. It was illuminated by the sun and the passing storm was in the backround, making the cloud even more spectacular! The colors ranged from yellow to blue,purple,orange, and pink! I wished I had a camera with me! Just then I witnessed five or six Gold Discs passing from left to right in front of the cloud! They turned left in formation like our planes do, to go around something! The most incredible feature was that the left wing craft changed position from left flank to right flank by steering under the other crafts! They proceeded around and behind the cumulous cloud!  I waited for another glimpse, but there was none. I ran inside to call someone, but was not able to locate any phone numbers for the local air bases or military for a live story submission.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I watched &#34;it&#34; knock over trees to get to the road.  The trees blocked my view but it looked like ambulance lights, say if there were 10 ambulances.  Then I watched a tree parallel to me off the road just snap around 8ft. from the ground and just slam to earth.  Then I saw nothing but a dot of light leaving the atmosphere.  I had over 100yds. of visible road (runway) and saw nothing.  No sonic boom, no sound, nothing.  I turned the car around in fear of my life.  I have gone back to the sight and it may have some great evidence as to the crafts work.  It mowed down more than a dozen trees leaving burns behind.  I have found a rock from the root of the tree that is scorched everywhere except where the root was attached, meaning whatever did this has to be somehow electrical.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It appeared to be to large to be traveling at such a slow speed.The ufo moved smoothly across the night sky-not fast-didn&#39;t make any sharp turns.It didn&#39;t seem to care if it was noticed- why would it be flying so low and at such a slow speed over a town of ten to twelve thousand people.

A bright beam of light was coming in through my window and I happened to glance at the clock and the time showed 2:37am. Soon after, 3 sillhouttes were standing in my room around my bed. I was unable to move at all due to an outside force acting on me. For approx. 10 minutes the &#34;sillhouttes&#34; continued to stay pretty still with only slight movement, although they seemed to be communicating somehow. As fast as they appeared, they disappeared and I sat up in my bed. Once again I glanced at the clock and it read 2:37am. The next 5 hours of my life were total agony. I sat downstairs in my living room on the couch. My mother came out and had to calm me down. She commented about how flushed I looked and about how I looked more frightened than anyone she had ever seen. This event has haunted me ever since and I was recently introduced to this website, so I felt I should express it to everyone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

From my vantage point it appeared to be at around 500-1000 feet in altitude. There were no navigational lights and I could not decern a shape but there appeared to be burnt orange light swirling around it. at first i thought it was a reflection from the sodium lights on a nearby building on the window of the car.  I exited the vehicle and still saw it. I could hear no sound (jet or propeller). I then removed my glasses, thinking it may be a reflection on them but could still see it. I watched it until it was out of sight. the sky that night was clear and there was very little humidity. (unusual for our area that time of year) and there was no Moon. I belive that the orange glow I saw may have been St. Elmo&#39;s fire on the outside of the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

Behind the highschool is a small mountain towards the east of the school it has a single tower with a red light on it and a road that goes up the mountain but the road is in the tree&#39;s and is not visible from town. At about 2 in the morning we were walking and I happened to glance up above the hill(mountain but pretty small) and saw two lights that were small but bright and easily visible. At first I thought that they were headlights from a car on the mountain but saw they were much too high to be the headlights and they appeared to be moving around in a manner that looked like they were circling eachother, I said to my friends hey look at that and we all looked at it. We said to eachother could that be headlights? but we all decided no definetely not because of the way they were moving , how high they were etc. after about 20-30 secs. the lights branched off into 3 in a triangular pattern and turned in a circle a couple of times before merging into one and vanishing. All four of us saw this, only one of us saw the a little bit of it because he was blabbering on after I was repeatedly telling him to look! look you idiot! finally he looked right at the end when the lights merged into one and vanished to this day I am pissed off at him becuase all he had to do was listen to us and look but he kept saying whatever you guys your full of shit but how was he supposed to know when he wouldn&#39;t even look right? anyway the other three of us saw the whole thing perfectly and this account is exactly what we saw, they made no sound and the way they were moving couldn&#39;t have been a plane, and a helicopter couldn&#39;t have made those light manouvers. We swear to god this happened to us. I was told by my parents to report this so that is what I&#39;m doing should have done it sooner I geuss<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

He sent me to my regular doctor, Cesear Lara in Clearwater for follow up.  Dr. Lara is also at a loss as to what or how the little ball got in my hip.  it still bothers me some but not as much.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We are attempting to put the individual in touch with investigators, who may be able to assist with the case.

A friend and I were star gazing. We noticed flashing lights off in the distance, 1 foot above the western horizon; red, blue and white lights flashing. It appeared to be a satelite at first. As it approached us, we began to think it was an emergency plane or helicopter. It was travelling very quickly. It flew/drifted almost directly above us, and as it did, 2 more lights became visible for 10 to 20 seconds. It had a pyramid shaped bottom. Then as it passed by, the 2 front lights faded, and 4 lights were visible again, but in a reverse pattern. The wind picked up at about the same time as it was above us, so we don&#39;t know if it made any sound. We watched as it dissapeared 1 foot above the eastern horizon. Whatever it was, it came toward us from a point above the horizon, and went away above the horizon; it did not follow the curvature of the earth. It was very, very high in the sky while above us. It was visible for a total of about 5 minutes. It never stopped or slowed down. We don&#39;t know if it&#39;s related, but we also saw a bright flash in the sky, shortly after this craft went by. The flash was bright enough to dimly light the sky and ground. Neither of us has ever seen anything like this before, and we tried to think of what it could be. I&#39;ve personally seen many aircrafts flying above me at night, and can tell the difference between a star and a satelite. This we can&#39;t figure out what it is. The aspect that&#39;s most puzzling is that it didn&#39;t follow the curvature of the earth. It went by the earth in a straight line.<n>

It was apx. 11 pm when I went outside.  I was looking up at the stars when I noticed a bright ball of white light come flying by me about 30 ft away.  There was no noise, and the light was traveling extremely fast, so fast if you blinked you&#39;d miss it.  It was very low in the air, about treetop level.  The light came from the west and sped across the lake ( I was standing about 100 ft from the lake) and then disappeared.  About a minute later, another bright light appeared about 25 ft in front of me, sped  off inbetween some trees and it too disappeared.  Both times I saw this ball of light it was flying west to east.  About an hour later, I went back outside to see if I could see the light again, and this time I saw the same ball of light, a little bit higher in the sky traveling southwest and then disappearing.  It looked to be about the size of a basketball. It left no trail behind it, but because it was going so fast, it almost looked like the trail ( if you could call it that) preceded it.  There were planes high up in the air that night, normal looking plane traffic. There are no city lights where I was at, and except for the stars in the sky, it was very dark. I don&#39;t know if this was a UFO or what it was, but I definetely DID see this ball of light speeding by three times and disappearing.<n>

My son and his s.o. were taking me with them to my ex-wife&#39;s home. we were west bound on Euclid Ave. I saw what I thought was a metior; a bright orange trail of light crossing diagonally from high in the north to low in the south above the mountanous horizon. I pointed it out to my son and his girl. As we watched it came to a halt, from nearly, if not, mach speed to hovering. it appeared to be to the right of a mountain, thogh I am sure it was much farther west and highert (perhaps over the Pacific). Other saucer shaped objects came from other directions at a much slower speed. We got to my ex&#39;s, got her, my other two sons and daughter, went to a parking lot where the view was unobstructed, and we all watched as somehere around a dozen similar objects formed into a diamond formation, hovering. at times one or two would leave the formation for short durations then rerturn.<n> <n><n> <n><n> another similar formation took shape appearing to the left of the mountain, and some of those objects left and returned from time to time. We were all fascinated by this sight. i commented that i hoped they weren&#39;t cowboy aliens here to round up human cattle for their tables, or aliens that figured they&#39;d best eliminate this warlike speices from the universe before we become a danger to them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> then both formations broke off into various directions. I didn&#39;t call the radio station as i was somewhat intoxicated. none of the others were intoxicated. thogh it&#39;s been a about a year this event is still indellibly etched in my memory. i would even suspect myself of toxic halucination if it hadn&#39;t been seen by the entire family.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

He then said &#34;hey look at that&#34; and pointed to the object. Witness #2 looked up at the object and saw the erratic patterns. Witness #2 came in the house and told us to come out and look at the object in the sky. Witness #3 came out immediatly and saw the object which had then stated to fade to red then back to white several times. Witnesses #4 and #5 came out and saw the object continue its erratic Eastward bound trek. The object went behind a small wisp of clouds and disappeared.We watched a few more mins. waiting for the object to reappear. We saw a light reflection on the clouds about 4 or 5 times before it completely stopped. We never saw another trace of the object.<n>

I looked straight up, thinking to see a hawk when I saw a black, coffin shaped craft over head moving directly away from me, I heard the whistle 1 more time until it went behind a line of trees. My impression was that this craft was low, 800-1500ft. and moving very fast (could have crossed the entire sky directly overhead in about 7 sec.). It moved in a very straight line at a constant speed.  It was sunny, clear, and about 75-80 degrees, with some high cumulus clouds. There seems to have been some heat distortion/haze at the rear of the craft. The craft seemed to be about 30 ft. long or the length of a Cessna 172. I like to watch and identify (with my field guide and binoculars) the aircraft, both private and commercial that fly over my house.  I am very familiar with the types, their shapes, speeds, routes, and flight characteristics. This was no know aircraft, and other than the whistle, was silent.<n>

The noise changed to almost a kind of bells and backup beeps - a combination of it.  I&#39;ve never heard anything like it.  It than sounded again like a craft hovering and sounded like it went North.  I was up for two hours expecting to see a crash or something out of ordinary.  There wasn&#39;t a crash or any kind of an emergency landing.  I called the city police the next morning to see what it was or if anyone else reported it.  No one did.  I know I was not dreaming.

My wife also saw it as she was sitting in the right front seat.  Our son sitting in the back seat behind me did not see it.  It was a very clear night and the massing of the Milky Way could be seen just by looking out and up.  There were several private airplanes out and about with flashing lights that were easily seen (but not near the object).  From my vantage point, in front of me and a little to the right (at, say, one o&#39;clock there came streaking down with a long tail (at 15 to 20 degrees from vertical) a small parallelogram with sharp angles, for the corners did not look to be right angles.  I remember that the parallelogram was a double image but I attribute that to the hour of the day and I could not blink to clear my vision or I would have missed it.  My wife did not recall a double image.  If this were painted on my windshield it would have been about 1/4&#34; long and 1/8&#34; wide and the tail would have been 9 - 10 inches long. The sides of the parallelogram on the right were lower that the ones on the left. To me the color looked blue green, object and tail.  To my wife, she said it looked more toward yellow.  I did see it though a windshield that had a tinted top edge, but I could not reproduce the color by looking at white road signs.  It looked big enough and close enough that we thought it was going to hit the nearby fields and make an explosion or something.  It did not.  It lasted long enough for me to say,&#34;Geeezz!  Look at THAT! and for my wife to respond.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke via telephone with this witness, and found him to be quite credible in his presentation of the facts surrounding his sighting.

I got up to go to the kitchen, but my husband was in the middle of telling me something, so i stood, facing him, listening to him.  He was sitting up resting his back on the wall underneath our window, so when I stood up I was facing the window (we had the blinds up).  While I was looking at him, a bright light outside the window caught my attention.  The object was very bright--it seemed to &#39;twinkle&#39;, and was gold in color.  My husband noticed that I was no longer listening to him and asked what I was looking at.  I told him about the bright light in the sky, and just as I finished telling him, I looked back at the object and I noticed that it was now many colors--they seemed to pulsate.  I&#39;m not sure of all the colors, but I know that one of the colors was green and another was red--whenever the red one &#39;blinked&#39; it was brighter that the others.  Almost immediately after seeing the object start to blink, two other objects &#39;appeared&#39;.  They were exactly like the first one I had observed, and all three together formed an &#39;upside down triangle&#39; in the sky.  They were motionless for about a minute, then began moving slowly, staying in their triangle formation.  My husband also witnessed this.  We stayed at the window to see if they would come back, and they did in about a minute.  This time, however, they were not in formation and there were only two of them.  They were split apart--when the three were together they were positioned between 2 trees, so they were in clear view--this time there was one behind each tree.  Neither of the trees were thick with leaves, and the objects&#39; lights were still blinking, so the objects were visible.  They stayed behind the trees for a minute, then went way, then came back about a minute later, then went away again.  We did not see them after this.  My husband doesn&#39;t really believe in UFOs, so he keeps telling me that they were just airplanes or helicopters or something, but I ! used to live in Latrobe, near the airport, and also near a hospital, so I know what helicopters and airplanes look like, and believe me, these objects were neither airplanes or helicopters.  Also, my cat was acting really strange all through the night and this morning.  She got under the covers last night to bite and scratch one of my feet (which she has never done before).  In fact, she got so aggressive that it woke me up a few times.  Also, this morning when I got up she started hissing at me and making weird sounds and her fur  was standing straight up, like she was spooked.<n>

It was a cloudless night. We had a Coleman lantern and I was watching the end of my rod looking for twitches that would mean I had a fish on. I suddenly noticed a light reflected in the water and I looked up to see a bright &#34;star&#34; that was rapidly getting brighter. I yelled to my husband who wasn&#39;t fishing and hadn&#39;t yet noticed it. For a second I thought it was a meteorite heading dead on for us as there was no movement at all. I was convinced for just a moment that we were going to get hit and die by meteorite! Then I noticed there were no &#34;sparks&#34; like I&#39;ve seen in other fireballs I&#39;ve witnessed and I next decided it must be a super nova. It got so bright it almost hurt my eyes, it lit up the woods around us, even brighter than a full moon would. It then started to dim at the same speed that it brightened and eventually faded away to nothing. It seemed to take a long time, but I&#39;d guess it was actually around 30 seconds in duration.<n> <n><n> <n><n> If I remember correctly, I think I heard something reported on the local news a few days later involving a bright light or a super nova, but I&#39;m not sure.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have since seen aerial flares on TV and though they are similar to what I saw, flares actually have a floating feeling about them and they last much longer than my light. My light didn&#39;t &#34;float&#34;, it definitely seemed to be outside earth&#39;s atmosphere.<n>

I&#39;ve been an amateur astronomer for 15 years and was in the Air Force stationed at a SAC base for 4 years so I know what aircraft look like in flight, my immediate first thought was this is a Super-Nova I&#39;m seeing.  I was astonished, visual supernovas are so rare I thought I was a lucky person to actually witness one...well after watching it for over a minute I noticed it started to move VERY slowly to the north against the background stars.  Well that night if you check the weather records in my area we had wind gusts of 22mph going southeast so this object would be going AGAINST the wind.  Well it sped up and winked out....if I were to hold out my fists in front of me I&#39;d say it went from a stand still to disappearance within 6 fist-sizes, also I don&#39;t have any Idea of how big it was I just have the impression it was up incredibly high, I heard no noise and saw no shape, just that incredibly bright light....and I know about the perseids, this wasnt a fireball or anything of the sort, and it isn&#39;t a planet since there isnt any planet that would appear at the zenith let alone any bright ones like venus or jupiter... it&#39;s EXACTLY like I said, it was stationary for over a minute then slowly accelerated then winked out heading north......<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Had the lights been close to the horizon, as viewed from the vantage point of the witness, we would first have suspected that he might have been looking at the landing lights of approaching aircraft.  However, given that they apparently were overhead, that possibility appears to be quite remote.  We do not know what the witness observed.  PD))<n>

I was on the beach when I witnessed it. They were all spaced evenly apart from eachother. The center one shot strait upward probably 50 miles, at a great speed. I could tell it was moving faster than any plain possibly could. It stood still for a few seconds till the other one to the left moved upward to. The center craft did a zig zag pattern while moving down the shorline and covered what must of been a few hundred miles making very destinctive zig zag patter in less than a second or to. The third stood very still and then shot strait up very fast and than just simply dissapeared. I could see the first moving object turn sideways and is appeared to be spinning in place. The lights on then at the time were just white. They all went under the horizon. And did&#39;nt come back for probably two minnutes. But the one appeared again. Making very sharp, sudden , and fast manuvers up and down. I truely don&#39;t believe plain&#39;s can move like these objects were. I returned to the beach the next night. Thinking I would&#39;nt see anything. Much to my supprise i saw a very bright light in the exact same spot i had seen them the night before. And the light satarted doing the same sharp, fast up and down movements as the others. In these same spot! With in a few minnutes 5 plains started moving tword the very low flying object. At this point the object started to have very un- even flashes of light and moved north and dissapeared into the land. Still flying very, very low. The night before a half hour after they were seen a helicopter with a very bright spotlight was flying in the area where i had seen them, shining all over as if they were looking for something- yet there was nothing on the cb radio-at all! I&#39;m not lie or exagerating the least bit. I mean come on why would i sit down for the past hour and write till my hands hurt if i did&#39;nt see anything. Everyone who witnessed these objects were sober as could be. I never really believed, but now there is&#39;nt a doubt in my mind.

It was about 3:00 am ,me and my cousin were just sitting there by the fire enjoing the nice calm night. when i noticed first the light about 1 meter above the water it was larger than a basketball glowing red,just at a steady speed coming closer. from the annapolis side. we thought it might have been a coastgaurd so we ran away from the fire and hid in the shadows and watched.  there was no sound ,no waves,no reflextion travilling way to fast and smoothly to be a boat, so we walked back and continued to watch it it was about 1 km or less away from the island .it went straight by us(infront of the island towards the digby gut) we lost sight as it went to far past us we ran around but there was no trace of it. it would have been at least 1/2 km away from digbys shores. i know there some crazy stuff goin on here ,there is just so much connection with everones sightings there pretty much all the same,  clear night ect.  my boy friend saw a blue light about 2 months ago with 2 of his friends it came at them then shot onto the trees when they started to run.    I HAVE BEEN TRYING TO UNDERSTAND ALL THIS FOR YEARS BUT I AM GETTING CLOSER WHEN I FOUND THIS WEBSITE I WAS SHOCKED TO READ ALL THESE SIGHTINS THAT WERE SO MUCH ALIKE!! THIS IS A GREAT WEB SITE. I ALSOCURRENTLY LIVE NEAR THE GREENWOOD BASE AND HAVE NOTICED AN INCREASED AMOUNT OF PLANES AND JETS FLYING OVER.

Perhaps the sound came from something else and was coincidentally at the same time?  Thought I&#39;d mention it, maybe someone else happened to be looking up around that time...<n>

There were no cars on the road and I was able to see quite a distance ahead and behind me. At one point a yellowish brite light  suddenly appeared in my rear view mirror and it was moving at a very high rate of speed and within 3-4 sec this light appeared to be within 500&#39; behind me, then the light was gone. After going about another mile or so the light did the exact same thing and came up to me at a very high rate of speed, but this time it got closer and  when the light  went out I saw like little electrical currents where the light had been (kind of like what you see when you turn off a light and the filaments are still heated up and glowing). This time I immediately pulled over and got out to see what this was and I didn&#39;t see or hear anything. It was gone and I never saw it again. I had my cruise control set at 87mph and it came up to me like I was standing still.<n>

It was really foggy and directly across from us was a light pole, that was in front of a very large clearing between two forests. We were stopped waiting for the light to turn green for our turn to go. My girlfriend and I were in my 1981 RS Camaro. The light finally turned green and I began slowly turning left to go down U.S. 37.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About half-way through I noticed the fog behind the light pole beginning to seperate and the crest of the UFO appear. I immidiately stopped and watched. Subsequently everyone else 4 other cars I noticed also stopped. The object emerged through the fog and the light of the light pole shined on it. It was colored like coal, black but shiney. It had alot of contouring, similar to that of the UFOs in the movie Independance Day.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first the nose of it (assuming the nose) was pointing down and it looked like it was about to crash into the ground. Maybe a few feet from the ground, it then began to slow down and pull up. Almost like a computer in slow-motion. After which, It just hung there and didn&#39;t move.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was very very big, from what I could see sticking out of the fog, it had to be as wide as the clearing itself. At this time their is now a Super Wal-Mart in that very same clearing to give you an idea on its size. The object made no sound at all, except for the sound of the air rumbling around it. And their were no lights of any kind that I could observe. It was probably 80-90 ft in front of us, about 20ft from the ground.<n>

It was definately mechanical and moved pretty slow to the doors until it was alined with the window and then every  light in the house went out. When this happened we were freaked! Then it moved to the next back door in the town houses when that happened the lights came back on. the obect must have been at least 10 feet wide because it blocked our view of the shed that was in the back yard and it looked about 5-10 feet away. We were way to scared to see what it was so dont ask yourself that question.<n>

I pulled off the road into a big rock pit and reclined my car seat and layed back to watch for more.  I have seen them before and they ussually showed up more than one at a time. shortly agter seeing the star I noticed something slowly coming towards me in the same path that the star was in.  It was a triangular and had lights on it.  The craft was fairly high but came lower as it aproached my vehicle.  It had 4 lights on the front of it.  Two of them were red and two of them were blueish white. It moved extremely slow and it made zero noise.  It literally scared the piss out of me when it hovered infront of and around my vehicle.  As it left my area I could see that it had maybe six to ten bars of light on the back.  They were as tall as the craft and I noticed that two of them were red and two of them were blinking white.  That is about much detail as I can remember.  I am still in shock.  It actually was very scary for me.  It looked exactly like something you would see on unsolved mysteries or some ufo show.  I have always believed in them but now I know they exist.  Anyway that is about all that I can say right now.  Is there any expanation for what I saw?  could the &#34;star&#34; been the ufo entering the earth?

The aircraft had been taking the exact same course as teh prior object. Although once it went towards were the UFO left the aircraft turned south, and lost interest. Later that night I looked straight up and I saw a flash of light this light was silent and probably very high. The flash was large but as it went away it became smaller. After about 15 seconds the light got darker and I could no longer see it. This was not the first time we have seen UFO&#39;s. We seem them a lot and they take way different courses than the jets and planes that fly from west to south and vice versa.<n>

Saw from commercial airliner.|8/20/01|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/018/S18965.html|264|ndxe200108| Randomly flashing red and green lights at night. No visible body even when illuminated by lightning. Saw from commercial airliner.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was on a SW airline flight from San Jose to Phoenix, ~35,000 ft and 500 knots. I don&#39;t know the exact location because the plane flew futher west than usual to avoid a thunderstorm. We were over CA 15 minutes before because I recognized all of the city lights from the San Jauquin valley. Then everything went black, so I assumed we went far enough east to be in Nevada. I was looking at the lightning going mostly cloud to cloud in a 50 mile wide thunderhead to the east at about 40,000 feet. Then I saw red and green lights fly at a 90 degree angle to the plane (I was on the left side of the plane, and it was flying east. I assume we were flying south). It was flying at about 20,000 ft. I watched it for a few seconds, and didn&#39;t think much of it until I noticed how fast it was going. I spent four years in the Air Force, so I just thought it was a fighter. It was going at least 1,000 mph, because it was going at least twice as fast as other airliners going perpendicular to the one I was in. I always get a window seat and I spend most of my flying time looking out the window. Then I noticed that the lights were not flashing periodically like a plane, but randomly. Sometimes there were more than one red, and the lights didn&#39;t stay on for the same durations either. It actually looked like the whole aircraft was either red or green because I could not see an aircraft body unless it emitting either the red or green, even when lightning lit up the sky, which it did at least once. I watched it intensely. After about five seconds, it did a u-turn (changed its bearing by 170 degrees to about 280) in less than 100 milliseconds. Not only are there no planes that can do that, that stunt would have instantly killed anyone in the aircraft because of the g-forces. Then after about one-two seconds of heading almost straight toward the plane, but still 15,000 feet lower, it headed straight up to about 25,000 feet in less than one second. I figure one mile per second is 3,600 mph, straight up. Then it changed course and he! aded NE and disappeared into the thunderhead in less than one second, at a speed more then twice before. It seemed to be seeking out the lightning. In other words, If I was in an aircraft with that much capability, and I wanted to be hit by lightning, that&#39;s the exact flight path I would have took, assuming that I was coming from the west. About five minutes later, I asked the stewardess to ask the pilot if they saw anything on radar back then. They said no other aircraft in the vicinity for longer than that. After we landed, I told the pilot and he didn&#39;t seem to care and told me to report it to the FAA if i wanted to. That&#39;s all folks.<n>

Just then we saw a passenger jet (more then likely out of the Minneapolis major airport) traveling in a east to west path. WE held our breath because we thought they were going to collide with each other !! They had to have seen each other. Just after that the bright light looked like it shot outward deeper into space because it stopped where it was at, sat there fore a monment and started to get smaller and then it disappeared.<n>

It moved about slowly in this position for about 30 seconds before moving off quickly in a North Easterly direction. It appeared to slow down then but this could have been due to the receeding effect. Two males appeared at the site to witness the same object we were watching.

I rushed into my house to grab the digital camara.  I also was able to take several pictures of this craft. At first, I thought it was two seperate craft with bright red pulsating lights.  However, they were in syncronization with each other.  So therefore it had to be one craft.  They were coming from the direction of Rocky Flatts (nuclear facility) and also our local small airport here.

Although, several minutes later I noticed it in a completely different part of the sky and still moving from north to south. It was hard to keep track of because it was so small and dim. I gave up on trying to keep track of it after a while, and then all of the sudden it started growing in brightness, and for a second it was the brightest thing in the sky. After this brightness dissapated, the light kept moving in the same direction and dissapeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Report is consistent with the flare of an Iridium satellite.

The light was tiny and it looked &amp; moved like a satellite in polar orbit, but the time of sighting would seem to preclude that possibility, as the sun has been down for some six hours. It &#34;came on&#34; slowly while moving directly south, increased in brilliance over about 1 second, stayed lit at around magnitude -2 to -3 for about another second, then dimmed &amp; vanished over the next second, never to reappear.  I tracked its projected course until my view was obstructed by the exterior wall of my own building, and did not see it light up again.  The color did not change, and no trails or tails were left behind. Once it dimmed out, it could no longer be followed. The apparent size was smaller than the head of a common pin held at arm&#39;s length. The two meteors I observed earlier this morning before sighting this object both travelled very quickly (est. many tens of thousands of MPH), on a generally southeast-to-northwest track, and were colored white and blue-white respectively. One left a blue luminescent trail for a brief time.  This object was nothing like them.  The speed was all wrong, the direction of travel was wrong, and the color of the light wasn&#39;t a typical &#34;meteor&#34; color compared to any meteor I&#39;ve ever seen. Any ideas?<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  At 0230 hrs. local time, no man-made satellites would be visible overhead.  They would be in the Earth&#39;s shadow, and therefore not illuminated.  If a satellite is not reflecting sunlight, it almost certainly is not visible to a person below without special optical equipment.  PD))<n>

For 15-30 seconds or so, it sped across the clear sky in a straight line, leaving a substantial tail which dissipated fairly quickly as it crossed.  At first I thought it was a Navy type flare that some yahoo had set off for a lark.  It was the same size as such a flare and had the same velocity as those I have seen set off around here on New Year&#39;s Eve.  However, the light was a very bright white, not orange or purple.  After its rapid, soundless progress almost directly overhead, it disappeared from my view plane behind trees and a bright streetlight, having maintained its constant speed, trajectory, and brightness throughout.  I have no idea what it could have been, though I suspect that it was a large meteor or a piece of space junk re-entering the atmosphere.  It was probably nothing out of the ordinary, but it would be reassuring to have it identified. Please let me know if you have heard anything about it.  I can&#39;t believe that I was the only one who witnessed it. It was a real thrill!<n>

I was attending a wedding reception last night at the Princess Mary restaurant in Victoria, British Columbia. At the restaurant on the top floor was an outdoor patio where guests of the wedding would go to smoke and socialize. The group (5 in number) which had gathered on the patio were talking about how beautiful the moon looked coming over the western horizon and we talked about the number of shooting stars which had shown themselves throughout the evening sky. Just as we finished discussing the shooting star, which I had just witnessed, one of the people in the group yelled, &#34;What is that&#34; and pointed above us looking east in the night sky. It was a group of about 6-7 oval shaped objects traveling in a straight-line formation. They didn&#39;t seem to be lit up by their own luminescence but since they were traveling over Victoria near the city center it looked as though the city lights lighted them up. The objects appeared to be a grayish in color. It was also hard to tell exactly what altitude the objects were traveling. We couldn&#39;t discern any noise coming from the objects throughout the entire sighting. They proceeded to move in a westerly direction until they began to form up into a new formation in an square/rectangular shape and began to ascend into the sky almost directly above the city center. At this point the videographer who had been hired for the wedding was called out on to the patio and we all pointed to the objects in the sky and told him to start taping the event. A few other people who came out on the patio also witnessed the formation and their ascension. The objects continued a slow climb in the square shape formation. As they got smaller we could see their lights flicker and at this point it was hard to make them out. However, we did see some of the objects seemingly streak off into space, but I do clarify at this point they had become faint star -like lights. All of us who witnessed the event just stood there in disbelief but we all had to agree we just saw something unexplainable and it clearly was a UFO sighting. The sighting happened on August 12, 2001 at approximately 12:15 AM to 12:30 AM. The duration seemed to be around 3-4 minutes and the weather was clear. My background is I&#39;m an amateur historian and currently work in the IT industry. The other witnesses: One is a chef One is a student of Computer Programming The Videographer, I don&#39;t recall his background The person who first spotted the object has an insurance background The other witness who saw the whole event I do not know personally A few others who came out later during the sighting Come from various backgrounds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke at length over the telephone with this witness, and we found him to be an exceptionally credible witness.  We believe that the witnesses were looking into the southern sky, and the Moon was rising in the east, where it usually is seen when rising.  Please see other reports for the same date.

I seemed to have noticed I had my directions in reverse. The objects we saw were a little to the west of us moving on an easterly heading and the moon was rising in the east. I noticed on your website you posted the report and you correctly pointed out my error. In my haste to get the my account written and with not getting much sleep last night, I made the error. Could we change it to reflect the proper headings?<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thank you...<n> <n><n> <n><n> Warm Regards,<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((name deleted))<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Our gratitude to the witness for the follow-up comment.  The witness first contacted our Center at approximately 0845 hrs. (PDT), despite the fact that he had been out until the wee hours of Sunday morning, celebrating at a wedding reception, apparently under somewhat adverse conditions.  We admire the witness&#39;s apparent tenacity, and we are impressed that he was able to submit a report at all at that hour!  Minor technical oversight regarding the location of the Moon in the morning sky corrected here.  PD))<n>

Both lights where equal distance apart,(about one and a half fingers apart at arms length) red in color and about the size of a star. The lights also had a strange pulsation to them. The lights would fade in and out, but would not fade compleatly. I asked for my wife an my sister to hurry and come out and see this. We stood out on the driveway watching the lights for about a minute and a half untill we could not see them anymore. After we lost sight of them, we went back in the house. I then started to write down the time and any relevant information. I asked my wife and sister what they saw to verify my notes. That is when I found out that the color of the lights were red, because I am color blind.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke at length over the telephone with this individual, and we found him to be a quite credible witness.  Satellites do not course from east to west, except in very rare occasions.  Also, given that the object was moving from left to right, as seen by the witnesses, had it been an aircraft, the two female witnesses, who presumably have normal color perception, would have seen a green light, not a red light.  Standard lighting conventions on aircraft and vessels require a red marker light on the port (left) side of the craft, and a green light on the right (starboard) side.  We do not know what the witnesses observed.  However, please see other reports for this date.  PD))<n>

It was observed by my brother that in the grey area there were four evenley spaced holes that we assume could hold the landing gear. And there was also one square shape in the center of the bottom. My brother and I saw the ship descend from the east, and after the object steadied itself it travled west in a straight line over us.

I observed them from the other side of the lake I was staying at. They looked about 3-4 miles away. I stayed at Salmon lake in a cabin for a week with my family, so that is why I do not have all the location information. I had never seen anything like them before, looking at them made me afraid, for whatever reasons I am still trying to understand. The lights were near the horizon and very bright. The light they emitted was a white light. The first light I saw was the brightest. It cast a reflection on the lake. It had 3 different shapes that it kept alternating into every few minutes. The first shape looked like two balls that were stuck together, then it appeared to move closer to me and would turn into a five point star, then it appeared to be moving farther away from me and change into a fine point of light. The light did have an aura around, but you had to look hard to see it. The light appeared to be stationary. A few times it did move rather rapidly, but would stay in near the same place as it moved. The first time I saw it move was when it made a figure 8. A few other times it moved ever so slightly, but didn&#39;t really go anywhere. It also made a few &#34;sparkles&#34; but that only happened when other aircraft came near it. I saw 5-6 planes go near the two objects, it was hard to see them becuase that didn&#39;t have very bright lights flashing like most air liners you see. The planes could have been from the military, it looked like one of them shot a missile at it one time, (that is when I saw the first &#34;sparkle&#34;) but I dont know if that idea would be true, or becusae I have wathced to many &#34;UFO&#34; shows in the past. The 2nd ufo I saw was higher in the sky than the 1st, and it stayed in the same spot the whole time I was watching. It was not as bright and was about 1/2 the size as the 1st light. It had a shape of the two balls stuck togther the whole time. I didn&#39;t see the lights come in. I just had gone outside and saw them. I didn&#39;t see them leave either. I had watched them for a couple hours and the desire for sleep took over since my family was leaving early in the morning to head back to where I live. I would have stayed to see them depart, but they didnt show any signs of leaving...I could have been there till daylight watching them, or maybe just a few more minutes. I guess I will never know.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We suspect the individual was looking at celestial bodies, but that is a guess.  PD))<n>

We were camping out on the river by Salmon La Sac, Wa on Friday night.  It was a brilliant night, milky way very visible.   Sitting by the river in almost complete darkness, the moon had not risen yet, we noticed a very bright white ball hovering to the south of us.  Initially we thought it was venus, due to the fact it was due south, but when we cinally focused on it (2 minutes) it became apparent it was moving downward to the peak of this mountain. We then observed it after 1 minute, explode non-violently into two smaller spheres, and float around.  They moved toward the very top of the mountain when a craft appeared heading toward it. No noise, not fast, almost as if it was coming into land on or in it.   The craft was about the size of a bus from our vantage, as we could not really see the craft, we could only see the four lights under it.  None of the lights signified it as a airplane, as none were blinking.  The lights were 2x2 and were glowing a very magnificient orange. The craft got closer, to the two spheres, and they both went over the mountain, out of our view.  Then a second ship, identical to the first, made the same trajectory towards the location of the others, and almost zig zagged to manuever over the peak of the mountain. There were other sightings that evening from others at the camp, but this was the only one I was privy to. This location is far from any municipal or federal airport. Quiet an amazing scene from a previous non-believer.<n>

We were sitting by a lantern, because fires were not allowed.  Someone pointed to the trees to the north, and said look at this!  Everyone looked up and notices a big White sphere hanging out.  When I looked up at it, I noticed it move about 1 ft in my eye site then stop.  Then I noticed it trailing from west to east, then suddenly stop.  By the time i got up, it sped off. Then later that night, under a magnificent sky, to the south, we noticed a white orb.  This orb flashed, then split into two smaller white orbs.  As we were sitting there dumbfounded, the circled the peak of this mountain.  Then shortly after, two orange ships, that looked like something out of star trek by the way the hovered over the mountain, and docked withthe white orbs.  Then, they took off just like that. I am totally 100% serious here.  This was seen by 10 people. The way the ships moved, led me to believe this was for real.  The moved not only left to right, but up and down.  Very scary, but very convincing!<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with this witness at some length, and we found him to be quite credible.

I then saw another very small bright light amongst the stars and it moved across the sky in an arc, not a straight line.  That was followed by another, then another almost as if they were chasing each other.  The next few that I observed zig zagged across the sky changing speed and direction.  Then I observed a formation of four to five, lined up across from one another with one slightly ahead as if it was the leader.  These lights are all very small, bright and appeared and dissappeared very quickly.  The formation appeared, flew in an arc-shaped pattern then vanished.  This is when I became very concerned as I knew the possibility that what I saw was natural was about zero now.  I made my girlfriend come outside, after a minute she poointed up and said &#34;is that one?&#34;  I looked up and a light was very quickly moving across the sky in a very tight arc shape.  She became frightened and went inside.  I stayed and saw more of these lights.  The last one I observed before it clouded up was travelling toward me (due west) then suddenly sped off in the opposite direction, very quickly.  This whole event freaked me out, I know what planes, satellites, meteors, etc. look like, I have seen allof these, but these objects flew very fast, looked as if they were skimming off of the Earth&#39;s atmosphere, coming from every direction, I saw 40-50 of them within 1 hour and fifteen minutes time.  There was no sound as whatever it was was very high up, maybe in space.

8/10/01 20:45|Zwevegem (Belgium)||Unknown|25 minutes|A small object - first hangs still - then starts moving with BIG clouds - hangs still again and so on.|8/12/01|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/018/S18919.html|293|ndxe200108| A small object - first hangs still - then starts moving with BIG clouds - hangs still again and so on.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Hi, this evening I saw a strange thing in the sky.  It was a beautiful, silent summer evenening, without any wind.  The sky (and clouds) had some red and orange colors of the sun.  I was in the living room when my father &amp; mother called me to come and take a look at the sky.  There was something &#39;rare&#39; they said.  My father had his pocket-telescope and we looked at it.  Actually it was my mother who noticed it first.  She must have got goooood eyes because the object was very small (because it was far away).  By the time i was watching, a friend of mine came in the kitchen too (we were all watching through the window in the kitchen) and he saw it too, even without glasses.  I took the telescope and looked at the thing.  It was a glittering thing that didn&#39;t move.  I could see that it didn&#39;t move because it was placed between two electrical wires (it was much much further than the wires of course, but it was a reference).   I continued to stare at the glittering thing, and saw that it took different colors.  I don&#39;t know if they came from the sun or what, but the colors slightly differed (which my friend confirms).  The thing was hanging there for 3 or 4 minutes (that we know) and i (we) didn&#39;t stop staring.  Suddenly it started moving up at a constant speed.  It wasn&#39;t sensational fast, but if you consider the distance it must have been away from us,it can&#39;t have moved very slow neither.  So the thing rose and then there was a real FAT cloud after the thing.  First we (me, my parents and my friend ) really thought it was an aircraft that was crashing! It seemed to be falling. It&#39;s a kind of cloud you see after a BOEING aircraft but at least 10 times broader.  The cloud had an orange color (was it a reflection from the sun? it did have approximately the same color) and was moving fast (not from our point of view, but again considered the distance...).  After 1 minute or something the cloud was suddenly vanished.  We looked around and some little further there was again this little tiny glittering object that ! we saw b efore the clouds were there.  Then me &amp; my friend saw the different colors again. After 1 minute it restarted moving.  It was moving further away from us.  Again, when it started moving, these clouds appeared.  When the clouds were there, you couldn&#39;t see the object.  Okay, it was real far away from us now, so me and my friend jumped in the car and drove into the direction where it was located.  I had the pocket-telescope with me, i could still see the thing from inside the car.  It was really un-necessary for us to move, because it went MUCH faster than we did, so we drove back home.  The last thing i saw (at home again) was the cloud (but very far away), i stared at it, but at once it was gone. i never saw it back. In my opinion, it was no balloon, that&#39;s too slow An aircraft... i don&#39;t know, i&#39;ve never seen such big clouds after a plane.  Besides, what aircraft can hang still in the air? I have absolutely no idea what this was, but it was a strange phenomena. I&#39;m not making this up, i&#39;m too tired for jokes... Maybe someone else has seen something like this too, or maybe it can be explained... I hope to find an answer or hear about it. Bye...<n>

8/10/01 11:47|Philadelphia (suburbs of, Hwy/Rt. 476)|PA|Cigar|20 seconds|TRUCK SIZE CIGAR SHAPE OBJECT OVER THE BLUE ROUT 476 in the SUBERBS OF PHILADELPHIA|8/12/01|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/018/S18911.html|295|ndxe200108| TRUCK SIZE CIGAR SHAPE OBJECT OVER THE BLUE ROUT 476 in the SUBERBS OF PHILADELPHIA<n> <n><n> <n><n> At 11:47 AM I was driving to work and directly ahead of me, a half of a mile or so, I saw an object that resembled a cigar shape, quickly, zooming over the highway, until I couldn&#39;t see it anymore, over the trees it disappeared. The craft looked as though it was not that large, meaning, the size of a truck. It seemed to refect the sky on the top, and more dark on the bottom half. It was not high at all, as far as my view, a half mile ahead, it looked like it was maybe a hundred feet over the highway. If I were to hold out my arm and clench my fist, the object would be about half the size of my fist. No one else, as far as I could see, saw the object. But, because I love looking into the sky, (FOR UFO&#39;S) I am more alert to the stranger objects then most people. This was not a plane, not a bird, not a helecopter. The object kind of teetered back and forth as it went pass. Almost out of control. I have seen ufo&#39;s many times, this was the second time that a UFO was within a hundred feet from the ground. The other time was last year about the same time period, but I did not report that.  I am writing to see if you got anymore reports posted.<n>
8/10/01 11:30|Salida (near)|CO|Sphere|2-3 Seconds|2 Silver Orbs passed under our C-130 Aircraft|2/8/05|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/041/S41680.html|296|ndxe200108| 2 Silver Orbs passed under our C-130 Aircraft<n> <n><n> <n><n> This report was originally sent to a UFO investigator concerning a well documnted UFO sighting in Illinois on Jan. 5, 2000.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Dear Sir,  I&#39;ve decided to write regarding your investigation of the UFO incident over O&#39;Fallon and Shiloh etc.  I grew up in O&#39;Fallon from 1976-1981 and graduated from ((deleted)). I am intimately familiar with the area that the O&#39;Fallon police officer sighted the UFO as I used to ride my dirt bike as a small boy behind the Jack Schmitt Dealership before it was built. Years ago there used to be an abandoned train track that ran from the O&#39;Fallon Lumber yard over to the old coalmine (as I knew it) towards Hartman Lane. This was before Interstate 64 was open and during it&#39;s construction.( 1977 I believe) My parents still live in O&#39;Fallon and I visit about every 3 or 4 years. I found your investigative report amazing and would like to thank you for such an informative and detailed article regarding the sightings.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I currently work for the Federal Government as a ((deleted)) and have recently retired (June 2004) from the US Air Force in Colorado Springs. I spent 23 years as an aircraft mechanic on C-141, C-5 and C-130 cargo planes and the last 14 of those years as a C-130 Instructor Flight Engineer with almost 3,500 total flight hours. I would like to recount an experience I had in the summer of 2001 (estimate) while flying a Tactical Training Mission over the Colorado Mountains near Salida, Colorado. The reason why I mention Salida, Colorado is because of the somewhat famous video taken in 1999 by a restaurant owner who lives in Salida. I have not related this incident to any UFO organizations as of yet and only mention it occasionally to close friends and relatives. I&#39;ll try to be short and hope you find this account as interesting and perplexing as I do.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As you may well know the C-130 aircraft is used for intra-theater operations at forward operating bases. We continuously practice low level routes simulating ingress into a drop zone in order to airdrop personnel or cargo. The C-130 unit located at Peterson AFB CO is currently the largest Air Force Reserve unit in the United States with 16 aircraft assigned.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were flying a low level mountain route in a three ship formation west of Salida and north-west of Monarch Ski Area. When accomplishing tactical maneuvers we would typically fly no lower than 500 feet and use the terrain and mountains in order to enhance our survivability. During these low level mountain routes the other aircraft in the formation would normally fly what is called fluid trail. This means that they are able to maneuver as they see fit and it is not until we approach the drop zone within 5 miles do we form back up into an airdrop configuration with each aircraft behind each other approximately 2000 feet. The reason I mention this is because I do not believe any other aircrew members on the other aircraft witnessed what I did.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As we were approaching a ridge line crossing at approximately 500 feet above ground level I glanced out of the co-pilots lower right side window near his right leg. If you are familiar with the C-130 you know that it has 23 windows surrounding the flight deck area and has an excellent view not only in front of the aircraft but also down and below the front of the aircraft. I witnessed 2 Silver Orbs or Balls, side by side, moving in the opposite direction approximately 100-200 feet below and to the right of our aircraft. I  have since recounted these Orbs as being in formation.(C-130 Talk) My view of these orbs was only for 2 or 3 seconds as we were traveling between 230-250 knots indicated airspeed. My first thought was that of the orange balls located on power lines for aircraft identification. But these were not orange and there were no power lines in our vicinity given the altitude and mountainous terrain involved. As I look back on it now I can still see these 2 Silver Objects as they moved below and past our aircraft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I do not recall if I mentioned this to the Co-pilot or not. He would most likely have been the only other person to have seen these 2 silver objects unless the Loadmaster in the back was standing in the right rear troop door and looking out. And since this was a mountain route with the possibility of severe turbulence he would have been sitting down and strapped in since we have had injuries in the past. I could not tell the size of the 2 objects but I would estimate them to be 10-15 feet in circumference maybe bigger. Again I only witnessed them for 2 or 3 seconds and then they were gone. I could not exactly determine their size.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The funny thing is I know what I saw. And will never forget. I&#39;m sorry if I rambled on but I wanted to thank you again for the article about the Illinois UFO. Feel free to contact me if you have any questions. I do plan on reporting this to a UFO organization soon. Do you recommend one over the other?? I was thinking MUFON although it probably really doesn&#39;t matter.<n> <n><n> <n><n> If you have time I would be interested in any thoughts you have about this incident. Thank You    Msgt.

I do not know if what I saw was a UFO, but it diplayed unusual abilities.  I woke up shortly before 5AM EDT, to use the restroom, I had been sleeping since 11PM, there were electrical storms in the area at that time, but none directly overhead.  I was looking out the bathroom window at the cloud to cloud lightning coming from the west, the window faced west.  I noticed to the northwest what I first thought was a star or planet, but it kept moving in a west to east direction, and as it got closer I believed it to be an aircraft trying to out-run the approaching storm.  I saw what I believe to be wing red and green lights on the object which I took as wing markers.  All of a sudden the object turned south and dove very rapidly toward the earth, I thought that it was going to crash.  It stopped its rapid dive , turned to the north and rapidly climbed into the approaching storm cloud and disappeared.<n>

I had a clear, panoramic view of the sky.  Bright light (intensity of Haligen lights) moving from West to East.  DFW Airport is located approximately 20 miles from my point of view, so I thought it was an airplane since planes fly in the area all the time.  However, this light moved at the speed of a military jet. Suddenly the light came to a complete stop at about the two o&#39;clock position in the NW part of the sky. It was still much larger than a star with a brightness consistent with Haligen lights.  In a matter of minutes, it began to wane in size comparative with the stars around it.  As it got smaller, the white light appeared to pulsate with color.  I had binoculars with me and promptly used them for a better view.  This object, or whatever, twinkled and pulsated with red, green and white colors. At times it appeared to have a strobe effect.  I never took my eyes off of it and waited for it to make a move.  Except for a small, gradual sway of motion to one side of the other, it successfully disguised itself as one of the stars, staying in formation with them, even throughout the earth&#39;s rotation.  I watched for over an hour.  Now I question my sanity . . .<n>
8/9/01 23:45|Los Alamos|NM|Light|15 seconds|Jet chasing object over Los Alamos National Labs|8/12/01|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/018/S18922.html|299|ndxe200108| Jet chasing object over Los Alamos National Labs<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have been camping outside of Los Alamos.  Last night I couldn&#39;t sleep and was laying in my sleeping bag looking up.  I had just seen a shooting star a few minutes earlier and so was watching the sky carefully.  The event started by my seeing what I first thought was a satelite.  Very shortly after though, I heard the roar of a jet plane.  I have been camping here for several months, so I&#39;m familiar with the jets that normally pass over the area.  This jet was excessively lowd and I was confused for a second.  Then the jet came out from behind a tree and I could see that it was following the &#34;satelite&#34; which I could now see clearly was at a low altitude.  The light and the jet had both come from the west and had apparently just cleared the mountains west of Los Alamos.  The object and jet maintained the exact same distance for the entire time of the incidence.  They both flew directly over the lab and much lower than any aircraft I had previously witnessed. It looked as if they were tied together, since the distance between them never varied.  The light in front continued to look like a satelite the entire time, while the jet had it lights on and was clearly blinking and showing its normal lights.  I looked at the object as it went by and couldn&#39;t see any shape and couldn&#39;t tell how big it was.  The jet was obviously &#34;after&#34; it.  There was no sonic boomb, so the two objects were going less than the speed of sound, however they were moving much faster than the commercial jets which fly over often.<n>

It had a red light on each end of it, and it seemed to change to blue, and then red, but just once. I tried to film it with my camcorder, but it for some reason wouldn`t work, at all, and i had just charged it. Then, it suddenly zoomed into air. And i Proise i am not copying from close encounters of the third kind, but it made one high pitch, another a tad bit lower, then a very low sound. I live out in the country side, and the tv wasn`t on inside. I`m not sure what i saw, but i considered all the facts of what it could be, but i can`t think of anything it would be.

I could barely see it for about 10 seconds &amp; then it seemed to disappear.  Then the white light appeared again in the same area of the sky.  It should have been much further north if it had been maintaining a normal speed.  We then saw it appear again in a more westerly direction.  For two minutes it appeared &amp; disappeared in different locations of the north &amp; west sky. Until if finally disappeared all together.<n>

Observed through 7X35 wide angle binoculars and was void of any sound whatsoever. No visible navigation or anti-collision lights. Estimated distance to be 3\4 miles from my point of view. Size difficult to determine but looked to be no larger than small commuter plane or F-16 fighter. Object accelerated upwards and advanced to a position in the southern (45 degrees) horizon in just two seconds covering an estimated distance of 8-9 miles. Object moved based on estimated size at about 30-40 MPH in a westerly direction across my line of vision. Movement or travel appeared to occilate up and down while maintaining the same distance between my observation point and said object. Observation continued west until it appeared to suddenly vanish from view. I have over 34 years of professional military aviation experience and for ten years (1988-1998) worked as a flight test engineer at Edwards Air Force Base California.

I ran back into the kitchen and continued to look for the &#34;oval object&#34;.  Beyond my belief, it was still there.  I took a picture of it and that&#39;s when it dashed away.

It definitely took place during that week though.  The reason why I can be sure of this, was due to the time of year.  The end of the first week &amp; beginning of the second week of August is the time of year when we get a lot of &#39;shooting stars&#39;  My girlfiend &amp; I drove from Longueil, (just south of Montreal) to Bromont, approx 45 minutes east of Montreal, to get away from the light pollution, so we could see the shooting stars better.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were parked near Mont Shefford, a small ski hill.  While watching the sky for shooting stars, we observed a formation type craft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There were several sections to it, however, it was a completely connected structure. It was large, about the 3/4 size of a football field.  It moved slowly across the sky (unknown in what direction).  There was no sound, complete silence. There were no bright lights on the object, however the object was brighter than the night sky, so I would say it was dimly lit. (I do not know if I should answer below if there were lights on it or not)  It is difficult to determine the distance from the ground to the object.  Minimum 2500 feet, probably more.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Our initial reaction was that we were looking at the the International Space Station. That was the only logical explanation we could come up with.  This theory was dismissed by a speaker at the Dow Planetarium in Montreal when we asked him if it was possible to see the Space Station from the ground.  We described the object to him, and he quizzicaly looked at us.  It was as if he knew what we had seen, but he would not elaborate on it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Note:  I am in the process of moving.  I will leave my future address, &amp; my daytime phone number, as my residential number may change.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

While standing on the beach admiring the star filled sky with 4 other family members we noticed a sphere shaped object track across the night sky. This object appeared to me metallic in nature as the light from the full moon was reflecting off of it at diffrent angles as it moved across the sky. The size of the object would be equivalent to a dime viewed at thirty feet. The object tracked across the sky in a straight line. It is interesting to note that there were no lights or sound emanating from the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date may be approximate, although the witness does not indicate that fact.

I live in Waterloo, about 1 hour west of Toronto, and on  Wednesday, Aug. 8th, shortly before 11PM I was outside waiting for the dog to &#34;do her business.&#34;  While waiting, I just so happened to look up northwest (at an angle of 45-50 degrees), and saw what appeared to be a slightly &#34;out-of-focus&#34; ball of white light flying across the sky at a tremendous speed.  It was about the size of my baby finger-nail held at arm&#39;s length. It&#39;s altitude must have been quite high, since there was absolutely no noise whatsoever, but it went from nearly the western horizon to the eastern horizon in a matter of 5 or 7 seconds.  I would have passed it off as a &#34;shooting star&#34; or small meteor, but the strange thing is that there was no tail, and it did not fly in a perfectly straightward path. It seemed to meander slightly as it shot from west to east, like an bee flying from one flower to another.  Have you heard of anything else like this?  Thank you.  Sincerely,  ((name deleted))<n>

I can only describe its shape like that of an aspirin. It had no lights and made no sound. It traveled due south in a straight line and never swayed or strayed from its path. The street lights of the city illuminated the bottom of the object and revealed a flat, light gray surface. It appeared round but not like a ball. If I compared the size of the object to that of the full moon in the night sky, I would say it was approxiamtely one-tenth the size. The object traveled fast, but not as fast as a shooting star, and not as slow as a satellite. I watched it as it travelled to the south and out of my sightline. The duration of the sighting was approximately twenty seconds.<n>

The sky was clear,and moonless. We witnessed a formation of three &#34;military fighter jets&#34;, displaying normal navagational lights, and flying at apx. 15,000 feet on a due West heading. We clearly heard the familier sound of their engines. Trailing the formation of fighter jets (at apx. the fighter jets 8 o&#39;clock position)was a quite large &#34;Chevron Shaped Object&#34;. We were able to see shapes quite well, as the OBJECT and the Jets were being backlit by the starlight of the &#34;Milkey Way&#34;. Using the fighter jets size as reference, we estimated the OBJECT size to be 100 yards from tip-to-tip of its Chevron Shape. The OBJECT had three &#34;white colored&#34; lights -- one at the apex, and one at each end(or wingtip)of the &#34;Chevron Shape&#34;. The OBJECT did not display ANY OTHER navigational lights. The OBJECT matched the jets air speed and seemed to move more like a glider than a powered aircraft. The OBJECT and the jets were observable for apx. 2 minutes. My girl friend and I are very familier with the air traffic in the Tioga Pass area of Yosemite. There is a major East-West commercial air traffic corridor that follows the trace of Tioga Road (HWY 120). The steady stream of air traffic is quite familier and predictable in this area. Military flights are also quite common in this area. The flight path of the OBJECT and the three military jets we observed was south of and parallel to the commercial air corridor that follows Tioga Road. Neither one of us have ever seen an &#34;aircraft&#34; the size of the OBJECT we saw. Both of us are highly trained and experienced professionals (Health Care and Photojournalism) with keen observational skills and are certain of our observations that evening.<n>

Facing the mountains it was on the left side of the horizon, too.  On the left, moving further left.  It was moving quickly and sporadically up and down as it moved left.  Eventually I lost sight of it.  I didn&#39;t speak to anyone else at the beach but the two people I was with witnessed the same event. I NEVER believed in UFOs til last night!

My house is near the sea , so i thaught that it may was the fireworks of a boat . But there was not Boat ! Next , i searched for an airplane but as i told you before , there was nothing !!!!!!!!!!!!!! That&#39;s all . Sorry about my english , but i found intresting this event . Thank You . Bye !

As I laid my head on my pillow, I noticed a light in the sky. I thought it was a bright star at first but as I kept looking I knew it wasn&#39;t a star.  So, I thought it must be an airplane. I then saw a red and green flashing light. I thought it was surely an airplane but it was not moving. It just stayed in the spot it was in when I first noticed it. I continued to lay in bed and look at the light, why, I don&#39;t know.  Suddenly it looked as if it were falling very fast and then stop instantly.  It did not fall a very long time but it was fast and then an abrupt stop. I felt a little funny inside when I saw that and got out of bed to look out my window closer.(It was 12:22 a.m. at this point) As I strained to look out my screen, the light seemed to by spinning and I could see flashing or spinning red, green, and gold/yellow lights. I looked aroud the clear sky and compared what I was looking at to the other &#34;stars&#34; in the sky. They did not look similar. The stars were plain and not moving and this light I was watching had color and movement. I just continued to watch because I wanted to see it move again.  It did move again and this time it was in an &#34;S&#34; movement up and then down again. Not too high or low just small movements within a certain area (I was looking between two tall trees and could see it the whole time)The movement is what kept me watching, it reminded me of playing video games and how fast and over exagerated we can move objects with the controllers. Then it  began moving toward the trees very slowly and sometimes with a little dip or two. I watched it until it disappeared behind the trees. It was 12:50 a.m.<n>

At this point they got scared and decided to leave the place, and a they left, the ligths followed them on thir 5 to 10 minutes home, in meantime, the highway was totally lit by them and they could see them hoovering around them at different speeds, this time they could see little windows along the shape of the vehicle. Totally terrified, the girl instead of filming, would turn her head away and try not to see them, he was more calm. They got home and for a few more minutes they could see thru the windows the ligts hoovering over the place.

I couldn&#39;t tell exactly how far away it was...but it didn&#39;t seem too far. It was traveling very slow like it was looking for something. I noticed that there were lights all around the side of the ship. It was kind of like a triangle with a broad side in the front going to a point in the back. The two front tips seemed to have two brighter lights then the rest. It moved real slow for about 15-20 seconds, and then streaked off to the North. It was so vivid in my memory that there is no way I just imagined it.<n>

I saw a strange blued light coming from outside and I went to the dinning room to see what was making that light (the view from the room is a river that ends on the sea, at the other side of the house). I saw an enormous object over the river (about 15 meters large) that had the shape of a bowl turned upside down. It was dark silver and emited that blue light. The object was making a kind of humming noise. It stand over there about 25-30 minutes just as it was paralyzed and then it started moving not very fast to the sea. It was very close to the houses, so I could see it clearly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I never told this to anyone till last week I was talking with some friends and two of them I don&#39;t knew before started telling that on August 2001 they were at a beach party in Aveiro and they saw exactly the same object coming from the river and passed over them till the sea where suddendly disappeared!

I was awake at this time because I was staring at the stars. Out here you can see all of the stars without the city lights interfering. From the west, I noticed a dark disk shaped object slowly moving and stopping as it made its way towards my location. I wasn&#39;t sure whether it was my eyes playing tricks on me until the object got within 50 feet of where I was. I was inside my sleeping bag next to my girlfriend which was asleep. I did not want to wake her in fear of her possibly scaring the craft away by getting up and screaming. I was frozen in fear and curiosity. I watched the craft slowly slip by, stopping for a few seconds at a time and continuing. There was a very slight hum amongst the silence around me. It was very eerie. At one moment, the craft emitted a dull blue beam from the far edge of disc as though it was searching for something. When this craft, which was now clearly visible as a shiny disc, came to a complete stop again, I crawled towards it hoping it didn&#39;t detect me. I kept thinking that this craft might have infrared or heat sensors to detect any movement outside, but there was no deviation from its course/task. At one point, the craft got to about 2 feet from the ground and the humming became louder. I got back without causing any notice when all of a sudden, the craft seemed to become enveloped by the surrounding area. It&#39;s as though it became invisible but with a slight atmospheric distortion. I watched this mirage-like phenominon float upwards until I could not see it anymore due to the darkness around. After about 5 minutes, the crickets started again and I stayed up until the sunrise anticipating the return of the object. This has changed my life forever and makes me realize that we might not be alone after all. I just wish that contact with another intelligent life form wouldn&#39;t be so uncommon or so hush-hush. I can handle the fact that there might be other humanoid ! lifeform s that we can associate with and learn from. Why should there be fear in contact? It&#39;s not like it&#39;s an alien inquisition or missionaries! They are scientists exploring without trying to interfere with our future. Something like Star Trek&#39;s prime directive of non interference. Besides, we have more to gain from them than they do from us. Maybe it is a form of mercy to our primitive minds that they don&#39;t make contact yet - or self preservation.<n>

All week I had spent my evenings viewing the night sky and seen multiple satellites and shooting stars. At approx. 11:00 PM I notice a very bright object in the south/southwest sky, approximatley 25 degrees above the south horizon. It was the brightest object in the sky by a factor of 4 and I showed it to my wife. It originally had a south to north trajectory and a velocity that should have taken it slightly west of our position and over the north pole. I thought it was just another low orbit satellite. However, at 40 degree above the south horizon it&#39;s velocity slowed and it&#39;s brightness/color changed from bright white to slightly yellow orange. I had the impression that what ever it was has just bottomed out of a dive, in an arc. It then changed direction and accelerated/fluttered/skipped almost directly away from us getting dimmer as it went into the upper atmosphere. It then turned west after gaining significant altitude and went out of site. I&#39;m not sure what I saw, but it was &#34;not&#34; a plane, satellite, planet, star, etc.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness has significant technical background, which we suspect makes him a qualified, and discriminating, observer.

My fiancee and mother all watched it as it hovered over the house and then over the tree line and hung in the sky for 30 to 45 minutes. As I said, the last part of it was caught on tape. I would be interested in getting the tape magnified and thermal imaged to see exactally what it was. Through the bincoculars it looked like a cheveron shape, black, with a red..bright as a flare that seemed to hang from under the bottom. The light or whatever it was did not blink.

Mars was very bright and clear, a satellite was clearly visible, and a shooting star also was seen. Air traffic in and out of LAX could clearly be followed, as well as helicopters flying above the city. At approximately 8:55pm, an extremely bright bluish-white light appeared in the southern sky just above the horizon and proceeded due north at remarkable speed. The dot of light appeared to be 3 times the size of the planet Mars, and much much brighter. The light did not flicker, it was clearly not an airplane, helicopter, or satellite. ISS was not visible in LA on that date. Although it appeared to be in low orbit, it did not appear to be the Space Shuttle, which witnesses have seen numerous times before. The rate of speed was much greater than anything witnessed previously. The light crossed from southern horizon, to over the Santa Monica Mountains to the north, in about 15 seconds.<n>

Turned my head and saw a bright greenis-yellowish flash like a fireball travel about 1 mile in the close atmosphere. I know it was close because two private planes were in the air on a regular flight path above and behind the object.  A Southwest airlines was just taking off from Burbank airport and facing the object, if anyone corraborates. It was traveling about Mach 5, about 2 miles south of me about 4000 feet high. I believe I heard a &#34;psssst&#34; type of sound produced by it. I am familiar with the flight patterns here and Mars was visible in the background.  It was NOT any of these objects.  Because of the peripheral objects, I know this object was traveling horizontaly close in our atmoshphere, not at the outer edges of it.  I saw the beginning and end of the whole trail.<n>

My girlfriend and I went out into the country to look at stars. We usually go about 15 miles outside of town so the lights don&#39;t interfere with our vision. I was looking up and noticed a small point of light. It wasn&#39;t extremely bright or anything, but as I watched it it moved in multiple directions. I have seen low orbit satelites before, but this was nothing like that. It would move up, then maybe to the left, stop, and then it would go down and to the right at a high rate of speed and acceleration. Sometimes it would stay perfectly still but then begin to move again. The patters of movement seemed to be random rather than the same thing over and over again. I would ask my girlfriend, &#34;What way is it moving now?&#34;, and she would confirm the same direction that I had seen, without me telling her beforehand. I knew I wasn&#39;t crazy at that point. I don&#39;t know anything about UFO&#39;s, I never really even believed in them. I just figured, hey, we are only a small miniscule part of the entire world. So I would be self centered and nieve to believe that we are the only ones out there. If you have an explanation, please let me know. The only thing that I could come up with is that it was some sort of remote controlled satelite. But I think it was too high in the air for that. And why would a satelite make strange movements like that? Aren&#39;t satelites all going in the same direction in orbit? Do they have capabilities to change directions like that? Please respond to me if possible. My girlfriend is from Chicago but lives with me in Bloomington/Normal. We have made arrangements to pick up her dad&#39;s telescope the next time we visit them. I want to know more about what we saw. Please respond to me if you can. My e-mail is ((deleted)) or phone me at ((number deleted)) Thank you, ((name deleted))<n>

This object did not compare to the familiar shape of a jet, i.e. there were no wings, no tapered fuselage, etc. I already had my camcorder outside with me on the patio table because I had planned on video taping my kids so I took the opportunity to fire it up and film the object. The entire footage lasts about 3 minutes as the object finally moved out of viewing range in the distance toward the SE. I studied the footage and it was clear that this object was cylinder shaped with a notable shadow on its bottom and possible dome-like structure. The footage is currently under study by several well-known UFO investigators, and the early results are encouraging.<n>

Prior to leaving Tasmania, we had 3 rolls of film processed with the idea we would put them into a photo album during our flight home (approx 2hrs ago). Whilst previewing these photos we have come across a photo that simply cannot be explained in any other way but to be an unknown object rather close to an historic church we were photographing. I have not had time to scan a copy as yet to send to you although i will asap and would like your opinion on the object. I am still in posession of the negatives and have full intentions of having a re-print done on this particular shot to see if it can be explained any other way.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Seagull.

I was looking towards the monroe area at the mountains. It was just any summer day, some big clouds and lots of blue sky. I noticed some thing flying around like bees. About 5-8 of them flying in and out of the cloulds ,from big clould formation to another.They were like big triangle kites. My husbund saw this too and kept asking me if I saw it too. 1 min went by and then the crafts dove in the neariest could. At this time we could hear a fighter jet comming over our heads. Flying from West to East. When it got to the cloud and went through it, the crafts came out flying is random patterns. At this time I knew this wasn&#39;t birds or really big BEES. They were bigger than the jet, seeing them at that distance. Soon after the jet banked left,and tried to come back at the crafts. But by that time they one by one flew in a straight line upwards. We talked about this for along time up on that roof. IF IT WASN&#39;T FOR THAT JET WE WOULD OF THOUGHT IT WAS NOTHING.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I HOPE THAT THERE ARE MORE EYES ON THE SKY DURING THE DAY, AND NOT JUST AT NIGHT.<n>

8/5/01 03:15|Chicago|IL|Diamond|1.5 - 2 min|Diamond shaped object, orange in color with small points of light surrounding the main body|8/12/01|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/018/S18850.html|342|ndxe200108| Diamond shaped object, orange in color with small points of light surrounding the main body<n> <n><n> <n><n> Myself and 10 friends were sitting outside on a patio at approx. 3:15am. Approx 20 minutes after some of us saw a very bright meteor overhead we saw an object in the distant sky in the SE heading NW at a constant rate of speed. As it grew closer it appeared to be diamond shaped and an orange in color. It flew directly overhead and at its closest appeared to be about 1/2 the size, possibly 3/4 the disk of a full moon. There was a near full moon this night so I did try to make a rough comparison. I saw it pass in front of a bright star which confirmed to me that is was indeed a solid object and gave me a very immediate sense of depth that it was somewhat low in the sky but how far up it was I could not say for sure. It appeared to be luminescent in some fashion but illumination by the moon could not be ruled out as it was a very clear night out and the moon was bright enough to light up the lawn. Several people in the group described several small points of light, &#34;like the ends of a fiber optic cable&#34; said one friend (number varies between 6 and 7) offset but surrounding the diamond shape. I am slightly nearsighted with a -.5 prescription and unfortunately was without my glasses this night so I was not able to make out the surrounding lights personally but I very clearly saw the orange body of the object. As it passed overhead we heard absolutely no noise coming from the object. Minutes after the object disappeared from sight an airplane took off heading east over our heads from O&#39;hare airport. The comparison to a low flying commercial airplane was easily dismissed as we observed blinking navlights on the wing-tips of the plane, take off lights and an audible engine noise. The observed craft had neither of these. As the craft receded from us a girl in the group grabbed her 35mm camera and attempted to photograph the object with her telephoto lens and managed to take two pictures of it. At this time it was pretty far away so we are not anticipating a detailed image. The group of witnesses of saw the object consisted of people between the ages of 24 and 30 working in fields from business to art. Some of the group are very admitted skeptics and others are believers in the UFO phenomenon but the group consensus from both sides of the fence was that no one had ever seen anything like it before and could offer no explanation other than possibly a blimp or a balloon. Before we got in to to much detailed description within the group I had two of the witnesses go inside the house and draw the object independently based on their own description. I personally am into astronomy as a hobby and have witnessed meteors and satellites many times to know exactly what they look like. I can identify all the visible planets as well as the star Sirius. I know it was neither of those.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with this witness, and we found him to be an excellent observer and reporter of the facts surrounding the case.  PD))<n>

The object appeared to me to be squarish and a yellow orange color with very faint red spots of light surrounding it.  I heard no noise.  The object traveled in a straight line across the sky, not speeding up or slowing down.  It was a very clear night, with a nearly full moon.  We had observed several planes traveling from west to east that night, both before and after we saw this object.  They were all obviously planes, with the tell tale blinking lights and the jet noises.  This object was different.  We immediately began listing off the things it could possibly be.  Someone suggested that maybe it was a childrens balloon caught in some freak jet stream.  However, the wind wasn&#39;t blowing and the stars were clear, not shimmering like on windy nights.  I got out my camera and snapped some pictures of the object, but as of yet haven&#39;t gotten them developed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with one of the witnesses, and we found him to be quite credible, and a very good witness.

I would estimate the craft at helicopter height, for it was a cloudy night, and it was below the cover. at the tip of each, well, tip was a light that changed from red, to yello, to white. It was spinning and I could clearly see the shape in the night, it wasn&#39;t black, but kind of a dull platinum, the craft I mean, and I ran outside into the cold-a-sac to get a better view. It actually came back towards me a bit before going the direction it was a second a go, when it got to the point where it was about to be hidden behind a hill, it spun very rapidly and all of the lights turned green, then it litterally *poof*ed away, and it left a bit of smoke behind, needless to say, I couldn&#39;t sleep for the rest of the morning.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date of event is approximate.

I saw it pass, but as it did I saw what I believed to be another satelite but it was moving much faster and coming in from the west and heading east. I started watching it when it changed course slightly north. It was late so I thought I was tired and seeing things until it stopped and sat there for about 30 secs before it started moving again. This time due north and with a burst of speed I&#39;ve never seen before. From my perspective it was not over O&#39;hare airport. If I had tape measurer and held it up above my head with the sky behind it I would say it moved 4 feet in a flash. Then it seemed to be hiding behind some clouds over O&#39;hare airport, darting in and out of a hole in one of the clouds. After about 5 minutes of this I ran and grabbed my camcorded to try to record it. I woke up my wife and asked her to come out but she was half asleep and told me I was dreaming so I ran outside with the camcorder. I couldn&#39;t see the satelite size objects in the viewfinder but recorded anyway and kept speaking so I could explain what I was seeing if the tape didn&#39;t come out. About 5 minutes later I saw another identical object come in from the south like the other did and seem to be dogfighting or just goofing around but doing loops around each other and having incredible bursts of speed. Sometimes it would go one way then the other so quick without seeming to stop. A few minutes later they started hiding in the clouds and I lost track of them.<n>

Its course was parabolic and though its height was difficult to judge at night, it did not seem to be over six thousand feet up. It bore no resemblance to any aircraft, meteor or satelite that I had ever seen. I was on the porch of my house, which faces north, and looked up because I heard a strange muttering noise in the sky over the noise of the Saurday night traffic in West Houston. I yelled when I saw it and my daughter camr running out, but the object had already disappeared over the horizon,far faster than any helicopter could do it. The terrain is very flat down here and one can see quite a long way. My initial reaction was that it was a cruise missile, because it fit that profile. There were no news reports that I could find of this event the next day.<n>

They were all a light yellow/green glow of light and traveling in the same direction. They were at the ~height that planes fly based upon some small clouds they crossed above. They could not have been metal because you could see the distinct shape due to the finely detailed illumination of the &#34;vessel?&#34; They seemed to be just an energy source. They flew directly across taking ~15 seconds to cross the entire horizon. They also stayed in the same formation and were several miles apart. I know this could not have been a plane or balloon. It was like seeing a glowing ping-pong ball move across the sky. Anyone on the east coast see this?<n>

I watched it for about a minute, and then it seemed to shoot upwards at a rapid speed, which caught me off guard, causing me to sort of startle, until I could no longer see it. Since my little nephew continued running around and playing the whole time, which was less than a couple minutes entirely, he didn&#39;t see it, not that it would be unusual to him if he did at his age.<n>

The object then appeared to alter its shape to an elongated oval, then finally to a perfect circle (the circle seemed empty !!). It moved from 20 degrees above the Western sky, behind a sparcely clouded sky as it&#39;s shape changed from a pencil shape to a perfect ring (bright white at all time), towards the Northwest, then dissapeared behind a cloud. This siting was during North Bay&#39;s annual Air Show (on the shore of lake Nippissing), which I attended for the first time, as a visitor. I was accompanied by my 22 year old step-son.

I wlill therefore briefly explain the event please contact the filerfiles for the original report as this was a definate ufo sighting and i have photographs of the event. It lasted for at least 30 minutes while it hovered and manged to get about 4 or 5 photos weith a Canon 35 mm camera sporting a 200 mm zoom lens. it happened at  early A.M. i got up for a drink of water and noticed an extremely bright star blinking in the sky which caught my eye from my kitchen patio so i went onto the balcony to observe it and there it was, a diamond shape craft-star sitting in the sky hovering for over 30 minutes probably as long as an hour. It was brilliant white, flickered somewhat and with the naked eye colors could be seen either rotating around the top or alternating flash sequences....green and red. I of course then watched it with the 200 mm zoom lens and called for my fiance ( an ardent skeptic) and watched through the zoom lens. It had a red and green revoloving light on top or near the top it emitted a bluish beam at various times and even released another smaller diamond shaped light from the side which travelled away from it. Neighbours were also out watching because i could hear them talking aand wondering what it was and of course my flash going off at 1:30 a.m as i took photos attracted attention. it just sat there really high almost like a star for over 30 minutes. A commercial aircraft i think flew by at one point in the general vicinity, it didn&#39;t seem to veer off or even notice the object, i think it may have been too high. My fiance agrees with the following....it was not an aircraft helicopter or any other aircraft it was not a star it definately rotated colors red and green it emitted a blue beam and hovered in spot for an extende period of time. My fiance thinks it was the international space station but only because if it wasn&#39;t it doesn&#39;t leave much alternative. I know it wasn&#39;t, i&#39;ve seen the space station in ythe sky from mexico and i watched this object with the zoom lens I will let you know how the ophotos turn out or contact me and i will send them to you. the film is not developped yet it was -is kodak max. 400 asa. again i filed a report within the next 2 days on filer files so you could always retrieve the original report. The weather by the way was clear with great visibility. Regards, ((name and credentials deleted))<n>

They were in 2 groups of 3 in a chevron, like an airplane formation.  They were round and flat, like a disk or frisbee.  From the distance I&#39;d say they were roughly small ariplane sized.  I was struck by how solid they appeared, at first I thought it could be glare or refelection, but they had a substance to them.  The sun was shining brightly through the clouds from the oposite side of the sky (from my perspective)  But they didn&#39;t have any reflective qualities, just soft white in color with no markings.  They seemed to be moving, not very fast, but moving.  They went behind some clouds and then I didn&#39;t see them anymore.  I&#39;ve never seen a UFO before and I&#39;m not compelled one way or the other with &#34;UFO&#39;s&#34; but I did see something that I couldn&#39;t identify.  I saw them clearly enough to say that they weren&#39;t like any other aircraft I&#39;ve even seen before.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Precise date apparently is unknown by the witness.  PD))<n>

There was no wind, just this very loud swirling noise. No lights, it was overcast though. It was so loud we expected the buildings to explode. it continued south and faded after 5 or more minutes. I have never heard anything like it. It was not a plane, and this area is not known for tornadoes. The roaring, swirling sound was astronomical, huge.<n>

I found myself walking to our third story balcony and saw a cigar shaped object about the size of my thumb at arm&#39;s length. I saw it at a 75 degree angle off the horizon toward the East. It was a clear night with a few clouds and a bright moon. No sound came from it as it drifted east. I thought it was a blimp as I watch the light pattern flick on and off... However, I saw the shape seem to shrink and wondered at this until I realized it was moving east away from me. It moved or &#34;shrank&#34; very quickly and then suddenly began a southern line of flight again within 2 or 3 seconds. I watched it move south until tress blocked my view. I can&#39;t say I saw a surface-but it did block the stars. In addition, the movement away from me was quick enough to cause grave doubt in my blimp theory.<n>

It&#39;s speed was slow, say small plane speed.  It was moving (in course and speed)  steadily due south to due North, I saw it only moments ago so I&#39;m curious I if It turned or is heading up to Seattle.  The object was only at about 1,000 feet  or so, maybe lower.<n>
8/3/01 03:45|Ontario|OR|Light|0530|Two bright lights seen North East of Ontario, Oregon.|8/5/01|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/018/S18824.html|363|ndxe200108| Two bright lights seen North East of Ontario, Oregon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On the early morning of 03 Aug 2001 at approximately 0345 I had just went to bed when my wife came into the room and said that the strange lights were in the sky again.   (Sightings of strange lights were seen over Boise about 2 weeks earlier and I had seen one of them over Ontario and had mentioned it to my wife).   When I got out of bed and quickly went outside she pointed them out to me.   There were Two very bright lights in the North East sky about 5-10 degrees off horizon.    If you were to hold out your hand, they would be spaced approximately one palm distance apart. They were brighter than any star around them or any type of planet.   They were bright like aircraft Taxi  lights.    I thought that because of the brightness, they might be aircraft however the lights never changed direction as would be expected. I was in the USAF for 6 years as a Avionics Specialist so I&#39;ve seen hundreds of aircraft coming in for approach.  Within less than a minute or so I ruled them out as being aircraft coming in for a landing.  (There were no Airports in their direction anyway). Object (A) was Left of Object (B) and slightly lower over horizon.   It was dimber and yellow orange in color.  It was still much brighter than the stars. Object (B) was much brighter even than Object (A).  Its color would change from yellow to white.  Its intensity would also change.  I was looking at it though binoculars.  It seemed to pulse at irregular intervals.   This could also be seen with the naked eye. We stood outside and watched them for a half hour.  I took pictures of them with my camera on time elapsed exposure.   As time went by they were were not moving upwards as normal stars would be but they were moving South.   It was slow movement.   I could tell this because I was resting my camera on the roof of my parked car and the objects were creeping slowly  south torward a near bye neighbors tree and eventually into it. The neighbors tree is East of my location.   I called New Channel 7 in Boise and reported the sighting to them at approximately 0400. I also called a man at a nearbye prison who works in a Tower there.   He could also see the lights. My wife stayed up and watched the lights until the sun came up and then stopped observing them.    I went to bed at 0430. The next night on 04 Aug 2001 at 0400 my wife went out to check on the lights again and they weren&#39;t there. The third light was seen by my wife and disappeared as she was coming into the house to wake me. Sould the pictures turn out good, I will send them.<n>
8/3/01 00:30|Mercer|WI|Light|appro 10min|multiple lights moving in unison at distinct angles|8/20/01|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/018/S18970.html|364|ndxe200108| multiple lights moving in unison at distinct angles<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was traveling with a friend north on US Hwy 51 on the night of August 2, 2001 the sky was completely clear, and as usual full of stars, with a full moon over my left shoulder as I drove north. At approximately 00:45 on the 3rd about 3-4 miles south of Mercer WI. and directly infront of us above the road about 1 mile in the distance 3 BRIGHT Yellow -Orange lights appeared. They were &#34;stacked&#34; directly above each other. The size would be comparable to the size of your thumb nail when held at arms length, each light appeared to be about 3 - 4 times their diameter apart. The objects were framed by the trees that lined both sides of the road in this area and they appeared to be about 1/4 mile above the ground. They almost appeared to be a ball of flame as I tried to figure out what they could be. We approached for about a half minute at which time I pulled over to the side of the road to get my camera from the trunk of the car. At that time the objects were about 1/4 to 1/2 mile away, but as I pulled over to the side of the road the objects moved straight up and the distance between each of the objects increased to about twice the previous distance. As we exited the car the objects moved 90 degrees or laterally to our left in a westerly direction in unison about 1/4 mile, now positioned above the trees and the shores of the Turtle Flambeau Flowage (which we could not see) but knowing the area that is where we estimated their position. At the same time keeping the same positions above each other. After retrieving the camera my friend and I watched the objects for about 3 minutes, unfortunatly the camera I had was one of these disposables and was really disposable as nothing turned out, to fast of a shutter I&#39;m sure. But when I started taking pictures with the flash the objects changed formation immediately and formed what resembled a perfect triangle on a horizontal plane with each light forming one corner of the triangle about 1/2 mile above the ground. We watched them for about another minute at which ti! me we de cided to proceed further down the road to try and find a better vantage point to view from. We moved about 1 mile down the road and came to a spot where the trees were a little further from the road, at no time did we loose sight of the objects. As we pulled to the side of the road the objects slowly started to rise at about 500 feet per minute (estimating) At this time I attempted to take another picture with out exiting the car. I put the camera out of the car window and snapped a picture, about 5 seconds later a Pickup truck pulled to the shoulder just a head of us in a spray of gravel. (This was the first car we had seen during this whole time)I pulled along side the other car the driver (about 27 years old) was alone in the truck and his first words to us were &#34; What the hell am I looking at, I&#39;ve been watching those things for about 10 minutes. Am I glad I saw your flash go off I knew you guys saw them as well. No airplane can fly like that in 90 degree corners. This was really wierding me out&#34;. At that time we got out of the car again and the lights began to rise more rapidly increasing speed as they got higher. And suddenly they were gone as if someone turned a light switch off, meaning they didn&#39;t rise and simply get out of sight. This whole time we heard no sounds at all, from the objects or nature sounds as well. My dog in the back of the car made no attempt to get out of the car like she usually does. We continued into Mercer at this time and as we entered the town we relized that the town was blacked out, no power at all. The time was about 01:00 when we reached my cabin and we had no power as well. Power was restored at about 01:15 on the 3rd out of curiousity I called the power company on the following Monday and they wouldn&#39;t tell me what had caused the outage. I am a business owner in the technology field and my friend is a Senior Support Rep for a major corporation we are both 42 years old, I served in the military in a nuclear unit and he in the air force.<n>

Baker, and a couple of times my husband, and myself saw a plane like looking lights, but it was zig - zaging around, and it moved to fast to be a plane. That was around 21, or 22:00 hours, it was hard to tell the direction it was going north the zig - zaging made it hard to tell, but later on that night about 24:00 hours I saw these lights going east then it made right angle turn north, then once again made same turn, and headed east into some clouds. Never saw it again after that. It could not have been a plane because planes don&#39;t turn sharply like that, and planes don&#39;t leave trails of gas,or whatever. You might want to picture a Z in your mind except the middle line of the Z strait instead of slanted. Oh, and it looked like it flew higher than a plane could.<n>

The object was about one third the size of a street light as viewed from a block away and a little more intense in brightness.  The color was white/yellowish with a very small trail of &#34;sparks&#34; at times.

It was almost perfectly rectangle. It was very dark, I&#39;d say black all over. No noticable winds, no rotor blades, NO lights.

As I left I looked to my left before pulling out and saw a large cigar  (what I first thought was a blimp) shaped object at about four to five thousand feet.  I live 55 miles due north of RDU so it is common to see a jet every few minutes at these altitudes descending into RDU.  They are almost always going due south; this one was going south east.  That caught my attention first, I next looked for wings thinking this must be a jet but could not find any.  All I could see was a large cigar shaped white-gray object with a slight glow about it, the size of a blimp, but moving along at a  rate much faster than a blimp is capable of.  I next started to reach for my camera, as I did the thing seemed to shift into warp speed and with in two or three seconds put a lot of distance between me and it.  I would guess it was maybe three to five miles distant when I first saw it, then with in ten seconds a spot in the distance.  I did not take a picture because by the time I got my camera out of the case and turned on,  it was so far away the picture would have been a spec on the horizon.

Then I noticed the &#34;star&#34; moving to the north.  I shook my head in disbelief.  Looked at it again, and it sure was moving.  If I had a ruler with me, and held it to where i first saw it until it took a 90 degree squared turn to the east, it would have traveled about 4 to 6 inches, then traveled the same distance to the east from the turn.  The light then flickered a couple times like it was loosing power and then disappeared.

I observed directly west of Route 45 and Center Street, Grayslake, IL 2 bright lites stationary in the sky.  They were not moving as in the first sighting.  This time I was able to get my wife to view these objects with me and with binnoculars.  There were round and had lights which seemed to be like a multiple strings descending from top to bottem. They could have been windows but were too far distant to really confirm.  When I looked at them with just my normal eyesight they were very bright in the sky, and with the binnoculars I could distinquish the strands of lights on the side of the object.  They were quite a way&#39;s off in the distance but were very large.  They started moving towards the south west after about 15 minutes until they disappeared. Once they started moving, they moved rather slowly, or at least it appeared they did from my view. The first sighting I had they moved very fast.<n>

It was moving South to North. It was moving faster than a satellite does. It grew dimmer as it moved and disappeared after 3-4 seconds. There was no sound. About 10 minutes later I noticed the same kind of light moving at about the same speed near the North star. It grew slightly brighter as it moved east. It appeared to slow as it continued to move east/southeast. It eventually stopped movement but it also grew dimmer until I could no longer see it. There was no noise. Estimated time lapse was 2-3 minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We observe that the descriptions of the objects are somewhat reminiscent of orbitting objects.  They do naturally dim and disappear from sight as they pass into the Earth&#39;s shadow.  PD))<n>
8/1/01 22:30|Canton|CT|Formation|30 seconds|Three bright blinking white lights were seen flying in formation, circling near the horizon.|8/5/01|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/018/S18810.html|378|ndxe200108| Three bright blinking white lights were seen flying in formation, circling near the horizon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Three circular super-bright white lights were seen in a triangular formation flying low along the horizon.  Despite their low altitude, no sound was heard.  They were also moving very fast.  They circled the area before disappearing behind trees.  Their white lights were blinking, each with its own frequency that differed slightly from the other two.  When compared to a plane, these three white lights were reported as being much much brighter and moving much faster.  They were also following a path that was not similar to the usual flight pattern of airplanes in the area.  The observer is usually a UFO skeptic who would rather not dwell on the subject, but he was slightly riled up and excited by this sighting.  He repeatedly made the comment that &#34;that definitely was not an airplane&#34; and also said, &#34;I know that was not a weather balloon.&#34;  It was clear from that reference that he was rethinking his thoughts on UFO&#39;s and aliens.  He also said that he had felt like he was being drawn outside to look for the lights after he lost sight of them.  Having known the observer for many years, I was surprised by his level of intrigue and fascination.  I would say that he might now be a believer, even though he has always been one of the more skeptical people I know.  The observer and I went out the next night at the same time and in the same location, a rural neighborhood, to watch for any strange lights, but none were seen.<n>

8/1/01 22:00|Rockford|IL|Light|10 minutes|Possible explanation for sighting in Rockford, IL.|1/11/02|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/021/S21001.html|380|ndxe200108| Possible explanation for sighting in Rockford, IL.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am writing this to offer information that may be helpful in regards to the 1/11/2001 Rockford Illinois report.  I didn&#39;t see the lights that night, but did last summer.  The same sort of things were approaching from north, headed south.  The 1/11 report mentioned a hum.  I live on the edge of Rockford, and had the benefit of a quieter viewing location.  The hum the large group of lights was emitting, only a &#34;tinkle&#34;, appeared to be that of many turboprop powered aircraft, probably &#34;Hercules&#34; national guard aircraft, flying in formation at high altitude.  They may have been traveling back from Camp Douglas or Fort McCoy Wisconsin.  The lights, once they passed overhead, dimmed, as if the landing lights had been viewed, and only the navigation lights could then be seen.  I hope this may help explain some sightings.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  The other reports submitted to us do not seem consistent with Hercules C-130, or any other type of aircraft that we are aware of.  The lights were visible in the sky for some 10-20 minutes, drifting slowly in distinct clusters.  Please see reports from Rockford, IL, and from Prescott and Prescott Valley, AZ.  PD))<n>

It was traveling from east to west, and doing so at GREAT speed. It ( as I saw it) came from my left, and went to my right, (I was facing south). I am a US Marine, not given to flights of fantasy. I have been observing aircraft for many years, as I am a pilot. The light was constant, not pulsing in any way. It was moving VERY fast. Then it stopped and after only a half of second or so it went straight up until it was out of my view. After stopping and changing direction, I watched the light for 5 seconds or so. In that length of time I believe it was extra atmosphereic,based on my ability to determine the size reduction and rate of same. It could have moved slightly higher and reduced it&#39;s size similtaneously, however this did not seem to be the case to me, and I had no sense of this possibility at the time. Not knowing the distance to target, I unable to extraplolate the size of the light or source of the light. My best guess based on my experience is 15,000 feet Mach 2.5. or approximately 2250 MPH. I have never seen anything even close to this before,and with 46 years of information stored herein, I have no idea what this could have been. It was not &#34;usual&#34; and was unidentifiable with the limited amount of information. It was not a conventional aircraft of any kind.It may not have been a craft at all. Flight path and G forces endured would suggest other. However a platform for such a light does not currently exist in common knowledge. This observation suggests it does exist elsewhere, in fact it proves it (to me).<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates a date of October 01, 2001.

It would be impossible for anything with which we are familiar to make such abrubt turns.  The viewing only lasted 3 or 4 seconds, and it was impossible to determine the distance from us nor the speed at which it was travelling.  The light was a yellow/orange color.  It was a clear night. Rather than tell my wife what I had seen, I asked her to tell me exactly what she had seen.  Her description matched my observation exactly.<n>

8/1/01 20:15|Downers Grove|IL|Cylinder|4-5 minutes|The vehicle or object was a strange glowing gold/orange color and didn't resemble any jet aircraft I've seen in the past.|8/12/01|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/018/S18916.html|386|ndxe200108| The vehicle or object was a strange glowing gold/orange color and didn&#39;t resemble any jet aircraft I&#39;ve seen in the past.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A glowing, gold/orange cylinder-shaped object was observed flying from a southwest to northeast toward Chicago. The area of observation is near O&#39;Hare and Midway airports, and several jet aircraft were in the area flying in normal traffic patterns, for this time of day.  We noticed the object was flying nearly at the same altitude of the jet aircraft, but much faster.  The object all at once slowed down as a B-757 aircraft departed Midway airport, westbound and flew past our position.  We were amazed at this behavior, as if the object was observing the jet. The object then accellerated to the northeast and disappeared in a wink as a B-727 came into view from the east. The 727 entered the O&#39;Hare inbound traffic pattern, flying downrange and turning 180 degrees to begin a final approach. We stood  in disbelief to what we just witnessed.  It seemed that object was right on top of the 727 and then just vanished. Based upon my 25 years in the airline industry, knowing aircraft performance, physical characteristics and traffic patterns flown by commercial aircraft in this area, I have never seen such a strange object or vehicle in this area. I am quite certain the object  was not a military or commercial aircraft. Based upon the following observations: 1) Aircraft operating in the area were distinguished by familiar physical characteristics, dark in appearance with wings, landing lights and anti-collision lights easily seen and flying in a pattern. 2) The object was a glowing, gold/orange cylinder with NO wings and NO tail section, it  changed speeds, and immediately vanished. I have witnessed UFO&#39;s hovering near the ground, and flying at altitude in the western U.S.  I have never seen an object or UFO enter controlled airspace until this incident, and frankly, the episode was chilling. I am very concerned about the possibility of these vehicles colliding with commercial aircraft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke at length over the telephone with this witness, and we found him to be quite credible.  He has had considerable experience in the aviation/airline industry.  PD))<n>

When I approached Co.road 23, to my amazement off to my left at about 11:00 o&#39;clock, I noticed a cigar shaped light which was hovering at approx. 100 feet from the ground. I thought, that&#39;s strange, no pole which the light was attached. I stopped, rolled down my window, and I heard no noise from the object. At that very moment, one half of the lights went out, and the other half went out slowly one after the other. At that point, I became extremely frighten, because whatever I had just witnessed had disappeared in front of my eyes with no logical explanation.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

Laying out by the apartment complex pool.  Saw two silver disks (basic, stereotypical craft with a slight dome on top) the size of a quarter held at arm&#39;s length flying parallel formation with a quarter sized gap between the two.  No sound. Altitude no more than 3,000 feet.  Clearly defined against the sky traveling southwest through the SeaTac landing/takeoff path over I-5 in the general direction of the Port of Tacoma/Bremerton.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The most outstanding aspect was that they were ‘meandering’ at the same speed as a Cessna 172 with absolutely no apparent concern about being seen.  As if they were in their sky and those who saw them should consider them to be an ordinary, mundane event.  There was no indication of how they were propelled, who was inside or where they were going.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have been interested in the topic for over fifty years and my first response was ‘finally I saw some’ not ‘what were those?’  Being familiar with the subject I did a check down eliminating lanterns, floaters, small aircraft or any other object.  Now whenever anyone asks if I thought flying saucers were real, I can answer in the affirmative without any hesitation.<n>

This is a big barn, with two sliding doors on the front, each about 15 ft. tall, and 7 ft. wide.  I leave the doors open during the summer so air can cirulate.  When I walked in the was a thing floating over top of a cow.  I&#39;ll try to describe it.  It was about the size of a tire, but square, and angled down on all of it sides.  It looked about 8 in. thick, and maybe 3 ft. wide, and it was black with some kind of grey markings on it.  The thing actually looked kind of beatup.  When I walked in, the thing just floated there for a couple of seconds, then went over my head, and out the door. It didn&#39;t go real fast over me, but I don&#39;t know where it went once it got outside, and it didn&#39;t make any noise.  I looked a good while for it, but never saw it again.  I went back inside the barn to check on my cattle, they go in and out, that&#39;s where they water at, and found the cow that the thing was floating over.  She looked and acted alright, but I found a place on her ear that looked like she had been poked with a needle or somthing.  There was just a tiny bit of blood there, and also her eye on that side of her head, had like a broken blood vessel in it.  I told my wife what I saw, and she told me that I was crazy, so I thought I would tell you.  I was also late for work because of this dawgone thing.<n>

Two were in the middle of the night both at tree top level. Number two of my three sightings was a red-orange glowing ball that passed slow and soundless overhead . The third and last was at 3am on a warm and clear florida night . As I pulled into my driveway ,getting back from work, I noticed a bright 5-foot ball of light weaving through the sky over my house. I lived out in the country in Florida this was in 2001 at the time.As I got out of my van I continued to keep my eye on this &#34;thing&#34;. It seemed to be alive as it flew over my home and then over the trees zigging and zagging the whole time(it was having a good time I felt).This sphere was a dense ultra white ball,completly soundless with obvious itelligence.  Soon it must of noticed I was watching it because it darted quickly away flying straight over the Australian pines surrounding my home out in Jupiter Farms(the inland rural quiet stacks, Burt Reynolds and Lonnie lived down the street a while back...for what its worth!)as it and sped away it&#39;s body got brighter and left a tail or trail that streghthed a extra few feet.Oh yes , it also grew in size a foot or two as soon as it began to leave...I clearly startled it is what it appeared to me!I stood there shocked and amazed of course and hoped it would return. Perhaps 5-10 minutes later this bright ball of intelligent light now came slowly over the same  trees it had dissapeared over before and then dropped down so it was now only 20-50 ft above my head !!!  I froze...slowly it passed right over my head and then in what seemed like slow motion began to cloak it self before my eyes. I was able to get a good look at it floated by me and did see a outline from it for a couple seconds before it was completly gone! Soon I had the feeling I was being watched so for the next twenty or so minutes I just stood outside looking at the stars. Sure enough over head I saw a white light the size of a medium star traveling at impossible speeds pass ! right over me high in the sky.It flew west to east then and before while it was partying over my home it took off south and returnedto me heading north.

The craft was larger than the strip mall across the street, at least two football fields in square footage, though I could not see the end points of the entire craft on all sides.  It was probably larger than an aircraft carrier.  It appeared rectangular or perhaps a very large triangular shape, but it was so large I could not discern the shape.  It completely covered the view of the sky from my window. I could see it&#39;s underside and it was slowly moving over a neighborhood of townhomes next to mine. I had woken up in the middle of the night and had a strange urge to look outside and that&#39;s when I saw it &#34;floating&#34; very slowly and very low overhead.  It was maybe a few stories above the rooftops of the hig! hest home.  It made absolutely no sound, and was a very dark matte finish (not shiny metallic), not reflective at all, with a very complex underside of infrastructure (i.e., it wasn&#39;t smooth underneath but had what appeared to be rectangular and other geometric shaped objects on it&#39;s underside protruding from underneath).  It had no lights anywhere on the craft, contrary to what a lot of reports seem to detail.  This had no lights whatsoever, and I doubt anyone would have seen it if they didn&#39;t look up because it blended so perfectly against the night sky and was completely devoid of any sound.  It slowly hovered away from my townhouse and then I saw it stop and start to move back to where my home was.  I always thought I&#39;d be the first person to run out to something like this and be proud to witness it, but to my surprise I was literally so afraid that I couldn&#39;t continue to look out my window and went hiding in fear.  I guess when something like this actually happens to y! ou, the perspective becomes one of instinctual survival.  I ha! d a stro ng sense that my observation of this had been detected and I felt very vulnerable and exposed for about 5 minutes and then the feeling of being watched just stopped.  That&#39;s when I looked out again and it was gone.  I wish I had had the courage to go outside and observe it more closely or get some photographs.  I have promised myself that no matter what, if this ever happens again, I will do whatever I can to get evidence of it regardless of how afraid I am.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of sighting is approximate.

Called Eagle-Vail Airport the next morning and spoke with a person we knew because we flew our jet in the day before. they said they heard of sightings but had nothing beyond that info.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.

8/1/01 00:20|Evart|MI|Fireball|7 - 9  seconds|Green fireball  travelling south to north in mid Michigan.|8/5/01|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/018/S18765.html|396|ndxe200108| Green fireball  travelling south to north in mid Michigan.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was travelling home from Midland towards Luddington (East to West) at around 12:20am this morning and I saw what I thought to be a shooting star tracking from South to North. I cought it early on and Couldn&#39;t make my mind up what it was, I was almost suggesting to myself that it could be a satellite due to the way it wasn&#39;t getting brighter, when it did just that. Slowly it started to fizzle like a firework, then it grew in size getting brighter all the time and seemingly sparking, then I saw a puff of green and then it all turned a really bright burning green. I past a few trees but could still make it out it was so bright, then I came out on the other side (I was looking pretty nuch North now) and the fire stopped and just this red glow continued for a second, then it was gone. But I do suspect there is a hole in the ground a few miles north from here. The object didnt break up. Have you had any other reports of this nature in this area, and does this fit the Russian booster theory? I would really like to know if anyone found the whole. Regards<n>
