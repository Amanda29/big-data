Early in the morning I was returning from work when in the western sky I saw an eliongated or cigar shaped object that appeared to be slowly moving from west to east, the object came to a complete stop several times and then it would move very quickly at acute angles and then after 3-4 minutes it just disappeared. It was quite high in the sky and compared to the moon it was approximately 1/20 of its size and had some type of illumination but not like a planes running lights, more of a greenish glow.  I have never shared this with anyone before and after hearing you on C2C the other night I felt the need to document my experience.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

He looked up and became transfixed, not moving or saying anything.  I asked what was he looking at and he just pointed straight up and said, &#34;Will you look at that.&#34;  Directly above us, fixed among the stars, was an extremely large, silent triangular craft that seemed to just float along.  Intermittantly flashing lights travelled in irregular patterns, to and fro, blue and red with a smidge of yellow in the mix.  We both stood in the roadway and watched it hover and move in a straight line until it passed from sight over the horizon of pine trees.  We spoke only of this to ourselves for the longest time, fearing ridicule.  No one tends to believe two 16 year olds with overactive imaginations.  As an epilogue to this strange event, one night my wife and I were watching Unsolved Mysteries in the mid-&#39;90&#39;s and Robert Stack did a report of strange triangular craft seen in the SE Virginia corridor and, upon seeing their re-creation of events, I bolted from my chair and hollered out, &#34;That&#39;s it!  That&#39;s what we saw back in high school!&#34;  My father-in-law, an ex-US Airforce officer, was sitting on the couch and had been in an animated state up to that point.  Upon my recognition of this craft, he stopped all he was doing and then just stared at me for about a half minute.  He then arose from his seat and walked--zombie-like--from the room.  He refused to speak of it to me and, from that moment on, I knew what we had seen was not open for discussion.  This told me the Air Force already knew all about it.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

8/20/76 01:00|Los Angeles (90 miles east of)|CA|Rectangle|3 minutes|A dark rectangular object appears over my car out on the road and telepathically tells me not to panic, that I knew it was there.|7/4/12|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/089/S89809.html|4|ndxe197608| A dark rectangular object appears over my car out on the road and telepathically tells me not to panic, that I knew it was there.<n> <n><n> <n><n> OVERHEAD UFO ON INTERSTATE 10  This incident is the reason for my interest in UFOs...why I’m          a member of MUFON.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The year was the summer of ’76, August. I was driving back from a visit to San Antonio, Texas, and had just seen a sign saying “L.A. 90 miles” at around 1 a.m.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I knew I was pretty tired, and this meant nearly 2 hours yet to go.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was leaning back in the driver’s seat, feeling fatigue. Suddenly, surprising even myself, I took a deep breath and threw myself forward, now leaning over the steering wheel, now my head way under the windshield.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I glanced up...and there, overhead, maybe 15, 20 feet above the car, just beginning to fall behind, was a dark rectangular (I assumed, since the rear was out of sight, so it might’ve been square) object, keeping pace with the car.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I felt a wave of fear striving to strike me... I startle easily...<n> <n><n> <n><n> And then the following 3 sentences were planted in my head telepathically... as clearly as if I were hearing them,  but I knew my brain, not my ears, was picking them up...<n> <n><n> <n><n> “Don’t panic.”  “You’re in no danger.”  Before I could feel relief upon “hearing” those two sentences then came...<n> <n><n> <n><n> “You knew it was there anyway.”  And I was seized by a terrific jolt of fear!  I quickly pulled to the side of the road, shaking, fully expecting some kind of attack. I thought I might be incinerated...lifted up by a tractor beam, then dropped...something life-threatening.<n> <n><n> <n><n> But nothing happened. And now I wanted to get out and see if I could still detect the object. But I didn’t want to do that without a possible attack being seen by another driver. Not that I felt anyone could help me, but at least if someone witnessed my demise, he or she could make a report to the police and my family would know what had become of me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Just as I was lamenting that no one was there to be my witness, over the top of the hill ahead came 3 sets of headlights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Now I had witnesses, and as they approached, I stepped out of the car, hesitantly and fearfully turned around to view...nothing unusual in the sky. The object was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Ever since then, I’ve been left to wonder...what does “You knew it was there anyway” mean? Is it evidence that I’ve been traced, tracked, followed my whole life and know it on a subconscious level?  Does this explain why from the age of about 4 to 7 years old I kept having a recurring dream and telling my parents in the morning that “I woke up again ‘cause I knew this big eye was looking at me real hard on the other side of the black, so I never can see it...but I know it’s there”? Of course asked in children’s language.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Does it explain an orb the size of a tennis ball coming down the hallway at my grandparents’ home at about 11:30 one summer night, slowly circling through the room, then crossing through it to stop over my head as I observed through the weave of the sheet that I’d pulled over my head out of fear...that then grew whiter and brighter and brighter till I “whited out”... and then woke up at what seemed to be instants later, even though it was about 9 a.m.? I was about 12 for that occurrence.<n> <n><n> <n><n> And did it have anything to do with several significant precognitive dreams I’ve experienced through my life and other paranormal happenings, such as dreaming my cat had been shot while I was traveling in Europe and coming back home to find she had been, though not killed as in the dream?  “You knew it was there anyway.”  It’s set me on a lifelong search.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Oh, by the way, after this incident, the following spring “Close Encounters of the Third Kind” came out. I about flipped out in the scene where Richard Dreyfus experiences loose objects flying around in the cab of his car, looks carefully and shakily out the windshield, and sees down the road a dark rectangular UFO meandering ahead of him... almost precisely my own experience.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was almost déjà vu!  And of course convinced me I’d had a significant, maybe life-altering experience.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))<n>
8/18/76 22:00|Tarlac City (Philippines)||Other|22:00-22:10|One big object the size of four hectars and two other objects the size of four passenger buses put side by side.|7/16/06|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/050/S50927.html|5|ndxe197608| One big object the size of four hectars and two other objects the size of four passenger buses put side by side.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I did not have the courage to tell anybody about this and I was looking for the proper authority to whom I will relate everything that me and my friend saw that night. Me and my friend watched a wedding dance party that night and were walking in a dusty road about 1/2 kilometer from our house and when we reached the perimeter of the elementary school I heared a high frequency noise like the hissing sound of a blank cassette tape and I thought it was the stereo player they used to play music in the wedding party but it was already far from where we were. My friend looked back at me and asked me if I heared the noise. We looked around but there was nothing but darkness all around because there were no lighting posts in that place. Then I heared a very low frequency sound but not loud. I stopped walking and I looked around once again but saw nothing. We were already in front of the metal gate of the school when suddenly I looked upwards on my left side as the sounds came from and there, I saw a very big object which was moving or flying very slow and very low. The object was round in front and pointed at the rear (as it moved forward on its round part). It was not revolving and it moved in a straight path. I saw that there were lights, some bright red and some were like phosphorescent lights like the ones emmitted by the numbers of a watch. The lights were like those of a valve in a valvestate amplifier and they were not blinking. We stopped and sat on the dust trying to hide in the hollow-block wall while watching the object moved slowly towards the western part. Then when it was on top of us I saw the rear lower portion openned and two smaller flying objects came out of the openning and the 2 objects flew very fast towards the eastern part and the two flying objects emmitted a light blue color. When the two smaller objects returned they were flying very low and theyu were almost touching the leaves of the sugar canes and they stopped afloat in the middle of the plantation right in front of the school. It was very clear to see the objects even it was very dark. They measure more or less like four passenger buses placed side by side and thay did not make any sound. One of the objects protruded something like a mechanical arm and it reached for the dusty dry soil and seemed to bury itself in the ground. We hurriedly jumped to the other side of the wall and peeped through the holes of the designed cement blocks of the wall. I saw the mechanical arm uprooted some sugar canes and brought it inside an openning. Then the two objects flew towards the big thing and entered into the openning. The big object moved in a vertical path higher then it stopped afloat. The lights went out and it did not move while remaining afloat in the air. The form and details of the big object became clearer as it moved upwards. Then it started moving sideways towards the north still in a very slow phase by that time it was soundless. The light turned on and grew bighter and brighter until it was very painful for my eyes to look straight into the object then suddenly it flew in an unbelievable speed toward the west and disappeared. The following day me and my friend went back to the sugar cane plantation to see the place where some were uprooted but in our surprise there were no holes or diggings in the site.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

8/18/76 17:00|Sycamore|IL|Triangle|15 minutes|I looked up and saw hovering directly over my head at about two story roof height three lights in a triangular pattern.|1/17/04|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/034/S34037.html|6|ndxe197608| Between 1973 and 1979 I lived in Sycamore, Illinois near an elementary school. It was a newer small suburban neighborhood surrounded by corn and soybean fields. Every evening before sunset I would walk my small white dog, Fritz, around the school playground and let him off the leash.  One evening before sunset during warm weather (I do not remember the month, day, or year) I had an encounter with a UFO while Fritz and I were walking up the school driveway on our way home. Three young boys on bicycles were approaching me across a grassy path to the school.  They were pointing over my head and shouting loudly. I looked up and saw hovering directly over my head at about two story roof height three lights in a triangular pattern. Even though it was still daylight, I could only see the lights.  I could not see a craft even though it was directly over my head. When the three boys reached me,  the lights bobbed a bit, hesitated, and then rose very slowly, crossed slowly over the trees and houses,  and slowly descended into a clearing three streets away where a new junior high school was under construction.  The boys shouted: &#34;It’s gone over to the junior high! Let&#39;s go!&#34; They sped off on their bicycles and headed for the clearing.  I just stood there watching the spot where the lights had descended.  About the time it would have taken for the boys to have reached the spot, the lights slowly rose from the clearing, slowly traveled over the three streets and again hovered silently over my head.  My dog regarded me impatiently, wondering why we did not go home, but even though he was off the leash he did not react or run away. Then I heard the boys returning, shouting &#34;there it is!&#34;   When the boys reached me again, the lights moved, hesitated, and then flew at incredible speed toward the late afternoon sun until it quickly disappeared as a star into the sky. There had been no sound and no turbulence.  Moreover, as I think back, the most amazing aspect of this experience was that I accepted it. ! I muttered, &#34;imagine that,&#34; to myself and walked the dog home.  I made no effort to talk to the boys about it, nor did they say anything to me.  I forgot all about it until I went to the movie &#34;Close Encounters of the Third Kind.&#34; In the scene where the three small triangular light crafts fly through the toll gates of the freeway setting off the alarm, I pointed at the screen and cried out: &#34;That&#39;s what I saw!&#34;  Then I was embarrassed,but my memory of the event had returned. I do remember seeing posted on a bulletin board at the Northern Illinois University student union a notice from a professor at a university in Chicago who was collecting reports of UFO sightings, but I made no effort to contact him, or to report my experience to anyone else.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

It haunts me still.  I did not remember the incident until some years later and tried feverishly to get in touch with the others that were with me, to no avail.  On February 6, 2000 I was watching the History channel at approx. 2:00 p.m. pacific time and saw to my astonishment a show describing the exact thing that I saw, the exact words that I had spoken during the event and the feeling that I had at the time and after when I had recalled the event in the early 90&#39;s. The incident on the show had occured in Alagash Maine, which is across the lake from where I saw this thing.  It looked to me as if the Sun was rising over the mountain, but it was nearing midnight.  I thought it was the end of the world.  Then, I said that it was only the sun and never thought any more about it until some years later.  I have been frightened by the thought of UFOs ever since even though I had never really considered them prior to my memory of that big bright light rising in the midnight sky.  The report that I saw on the History channel so disturbed me and also affirmed what I had seen to be true that I began writing the names of the others that had seen it down on paper as well as the names of the hypnotists that they saw.  It has taken me this long to ask for some assistance and perhaps just to let them know that what they saw, and felt also happened to me at the same time, although I cannot remember the exact date.  If there is anyone who can get me in touch with the men on this program I would more than greatly appreciate it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date in 1976 apparently is approximate.  The Allegash event, and apparent abduction of five (?) young men in the Allegash Wilderness in the upper reaches of the State of Maine is a celebrated, and well documented, case.  PD))<n>
8/15/76 23:00|Tierra Verde|FL|Changing|5 minutes|Watched rectangular shaped amber colored UFO perform S turns, change shape and exit atmosphere at impossible speed and left an ion trai|10/30/06|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/051/S51614.html|8|ndxe197608| Watched rectangular shaped amber colored UFO perform S turns, change shape and exit atmosphere at impossible speed and left an ion trai<n> <n><n> <n><n> On a hot summer night 30 years ago, my brother (a marine engineer) and myself(a college student at the time) were fishing in an inlet near the mouth of Tampa Bay. The night was quiet and clear. Suddenly, my brother startled me by exclaiming &#34; What the hell is that ?!&#34;. He pointed to the eastern horizon and there just above the water was an oddly shaped RECTANGULAR object (it had 90 degree corners). The amber color object appeared to just hang motionless for about 30-40 seconds. It was tilted at a weird angle. Shortly thereafter, the object started to slowly move in our general direction with the same odd tilt. As it moved towards us, the object moved higher in the sky. It was nearly 90 degrees straight up when it instantly disappeared. Then about 5 seconds later, the amber color craft reappeared but this time it was CIRCULAR or SPHERICALLY shaped. It continued moving due west for a few more seconds when it made a 90 degree left hand turn which brings the object in the sky above our heads. It then began a series of impossible S turns above our heads. We became concerned that this object was too weird and close for comfort so we threw our fishing gear into the truck and started the engine. At this point, the object finished one last S curve when it suddenly accelerated into an incredibly fast and impossible upward corkscrew movement that took it straight up and out of the atmosphere. The corkscrew exit from the atmosphere lasted only 3 to 5 seconds ! Left behind in it&#39;s wake, was a glowing corkscrew shaped ion trail in the sky that lasted about 45 seconds. We were completely dumbfounded but assured each other that whatever it was that we saw had defied the laws of physics and human technical knowledge. The entire sighting lasted about 5 minutes. There was no sound whatsoever. The object remained several thousand feet above us but was possibly the size of a large airliner or bigger. Note that there was a report of a similar UFO by a seperate witness about 10 away miles. This sighting was in the vicinity of MacDill AFB over Tampa Bay.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD))<n>

I had just graduated from high school two months earlier. Since this incident, I have written and published a book on automotive subjects, written for automotive magazines, and helped produce an automoitve television show.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was returning from my friend&#39;s home after working on his race car all evening. It was a week night, and I felt pretty good about our accomplishments for the evening. I turned onto the road that leads to my house, when I noticed a large bright orange glowing object in the sky. At first I thought it was the moon, but when I made eye contact with this object it began following me. I turned onto an access road to my subdivision, and when I turned, the craft (or object) had moved to the corner of the intersection.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I continued slowly down the street and the craft slowly moved in front of me and lowered its altitude to approximately 100 feet above the ground. At this distance, the object appeared to be approximately 20 to 30 feet in diameter, and there were two satellites moving around the object. One from the upper left hand corner, and the other from the lower left hand corner, both circumnavigating the object in a flash of sparks (similar to how a sparkler burns). It seemed like the satellites were moving along a guide that was attached to the exterior of the craft, but I couldn&#39;t physically see a guide. The paths of the satellites remained constant throughout the encounter..<n> <n><n> <n><n> The night sky around me -- that was moonless -- was illuminated in a bright golden light, while the areas around me were bathed in darkness. I stopped and exited my car ( a white 1969 Camaro SS) and stood watching the craft -- motionless and without any trace of sound -- for what seemed like an eternity. When I realized that I was involved in a stalemate, I got back in my car, turned the corner and continued to the next street. The craft continued its movement along with my car and stopped with me at the next stop sign, only now the craft was approximately 50 feet from the ground, and dangerously close to telephone poles that line the street. I turned, continued to my driveway and pulled my car into the garage. I walked out of the garage to see the craft hovering over my home, and once again it followed me to my front door. I sat on my front step and watched the craft for about five minutes. The entire time I felt no fear, only wonderment at what I was witnessing. At this point I went into my home to retrieve my dad&#39;s car keys. I left the house, still watching the craft over my home. I got in my dad&#39;s car to move it into the driveway, and watched as the craft contiued down my street. I gave chase with my dad&#39;s car, around the corner to the neighborhood ball field. I watched the craft descend through the trees onto the ball field, now flashing the same golden light in sequence around the craft. I felt a seismolgic event as it touched down and the lights went out. When the lights went out I saw what appeared to be a door opening on the craft. At this point, I raced my dad&#39;s car back home went inside and locked every window and door that wasn&#39;t secured. I called the local air force base, but they blew me off and the next day contacted Dr. Alan Hynek and filed a report. The entire time I watched this object there did not seem to be any portals or doors visible, nor were there any visible signs that such things existed, and to this day I wonder what I would have seen had I stayed longer.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

8/15/76 22:30|Weekapaug|RI|Formation|5 seconds|Three globular lights in a tight triangular formation passed east to west at low altitude|8/5/01|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/017/S17535.html|10|ndxe197608| Three globular lights in a tight triangular formation passed east to west at low altitude<n> <n><n> <n><n> An old report for the record.  This sighting took place a long time ago, but I remember it very clearly.  I&amp;#8217;m estimating the date by the age I believe I was at the time (16) and by the month we always vacationed.  Weekapaug is a small town on the south shore of Rhode Island.  There are a series of large tidal ponds along this shore that are connected to the ocean by channels about 100&#39; wide.  The Weekapaug channel has stone jetties on either side that stick out about 100&#39; from the beach.   On this night I was sitting on the tip of the eastern wall at about 10:30pm looking at stars.  The sky was clear overhead, but there was a heavy mist over the water to an altitude of about 30&#39;.  As I sat there facing the sea, and due south, I noticed three dim, translucent, globular lights move by from east to west in a tight triangle formation.  The light was a pale white.  I&#39;d estimate the speed at 50mph, the altitude at 75 to 100 feet above the water and the distance from me between 100 and 200 yards.  I watched them from about 160 degrees to about 225 degrees at which point they faded in the mist. My first thought was that they were the lights from a car&#39;s headlights hitting thicker fog out over the water, but the following observations seen to conflict with that theory. 1) The lights were well defined.  Each one looked like a frosted globe light you might see in front of someone&#39;s house, only a little more translucent and defused.  I don&#39;t know whether the lights were that way by nature or if the mist was defusing the light.  2) There were three lights that held the exact pattern, which was one light in the lead with the other two trailing at an equal distance.  3) The lights maintained a straight course and steady speed.  If they were the projection of car lights, the car would have to be making a tight turn to move the beams left to right so fast.  In such a scenario, you would expect the lights to either swing in an arc around the source, or, if they were shining on the straight edge of a fog bank just offshore, to diffuse and move away faster as the source beams swung to an orientation more parallel to the surface they were shining on.  These lights maintained a distinct shape and straight course, a very steady speed and perspective that changed in what seemed an appropriate way for an object traveling in a straight line.  In other words, as the object moved away, the two rear lights became more face-on to me than they were when it was straight out.  4) The closest a car could have been was about 200 yards behind me and the beams would have had to come right over me.  I looked around very quickly, but saw no car, nor did I see any sign of beams passing by.  Afterwards, I tried to identify a spot where a car could have made such a turn while maintaining line-of-sight with the full range in which I saw these lights and I couldn&#39;t ID such a spot. The lights struck me as a source themselves and not a reflection, and although the lights were diffused I had the distinct impression they were 3-dimensional.  I&#39;ve thought about whether they might have been from a boat passing by, but there was no sound with these lights and it was a quiet night.  Several of the points above seem to conflict with this theory as well, not to mention the speed.  They definitely were not the promotional spots that you often see in the night sky.  If they were something other than projections, they could have been three independent lights in a tight formation, or part of one craft.  I&#39;d estimate the apparent size of each of them at about the size of a thumbnail at arms length.  I would not go so far as to say these lights were extraterrestrial, but for me they were certainly UFO&#39;s in the sense that I have been unable to associate them with a rational explanation despite years of trying. Also, knew a guy who was swimming on Weekapaug&#39;s Inn Beach late one afternoon in the summer of 1978 and swears he saw a &#34;flying saucer&#34; come in off the water, fly straight overhead at a relatively low altitude and proceed inland.  That&#39;s all I know of that sighting. I was 16 at the time of my sighting and was not on drugs or drinking.  I was into astronomy at the time and enjoyed stargazing, hence my reason for being out on the dark tip of the jetty at night away from distracting lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

The red lights seemed to have landed on top of the amber light then suddenly the amber light spead off at an incrediable speed back towards the west. A couple days later it was reported in the local paper that others have seen it also.

People of all ages, approx. 50-60 residents gathered outside to observe. Most went back in as the sight was unusual but uneventful. The globes were glowing but emanated no illuminating light outside it&#39;s periphery. One touched the river surface and ascended back in it&#39;s cluster position. I did not witness their departure nor did I since find out how they left our vicinity.I assumed they also abruptly disappeared like the first two.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

Late one afternoon I looked into the western sky and became aware of an aircraft that looked just like a glider - cigar shaped with long narrow wings, a vertical tail fin, ailerons, and a white blinking light at the bottom of it which was flying across the top of a western mountain range. Suddenly it quickly moved South over, and probably beyond Santa Barbara (about 45 mile South) in a matter of seconds. We all became intrigued as we watched it further. It turned East, looped around and began coming closer to the ground and heading straight for us. After a few seconds I remember watching this craft floating about 25 feet off the ground right between our house and the neighbors in a large subdivision. It was painted black - like the stealth craft of today. It was so close we could have thrown a stone at it, but it made no sound at all - it was completely defying gravity. It was also dark out by that time - which now doesn&#39;t make much sense. The sun doesn&#39;t set that fast from the time we first saw it. It seemed to know we were looking at it and picked us out. I looked up and saw a pilot who was dressed all in black and wearing a black helmet. There was an orangish-pinkish glow that seemed to come from the instrument gauges and was glinting off of his helmet and gloves. He looked over at us, then looked back down at his gauges, then turned to wave to us as the craft started to slowly move away gaining speed as it moved. I never discussed it with anyone in the family until recently. Nobody else in my family remembers this event except my little sister who was 8 at the time. I was 10. I remember more of us in the back yard though, so I&#39;m not sure why they don&#39;t remember.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date may be approximate.  PD))<n>

The first and last lights were colored red, others were white.  No vertical stabilizer or wings.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object was moving south to north at about 200&#39; AGL.  It was a long (B-52 length) tubular shaped gray object with 6 or 7 oval shaped lights about 3 times the size of a commercial plane window.  The first and last lights were red in color, the others (middle) were white.  There was no vertical stabilizer (tailfin) and no visible wings.  The sighting was planform (from the side) so it is possible there may have been wings of some kind washed out in the bloom from the lights.  It was low to the ground at about 3/4 - 1 mile moving with no visible propulsion (exhaust) and made no noise.  We noticed it as it was abeam (closest point of movement) us and watched it as it moved North over a ridge.  It was moving relatively slow (about 80 - 100 kts reflecting back with my current experience) and was in view for about 3 minutes.  The aspect of it never changed; meaning the lights were visible pointing at us.The sighting took place near a remote cow-camp near the Idaho, Oregon, Nevada border back in Aug of 1976.  It was about 4:30 pm, 3 hrs before sunset with a high (about 25000 agl) scattered layer of clouds.  The observers were myself and my brother, age 7 &amp; 5 respectively, my father, age 50 at the time, and two Piahute Indians, one about 35yrs old and the other was 8.  The sighting was in the vicinity of IR-300 (Instrument Route) which is frequented by AF B-52&#39;s which is what we thought it was at first.  My father was a high school counselor with a masters degree and the older indian was a high school english teacher with a BA.  With the recent uprise of UFO ism in America, my father prompted me to submit this and helped me fill in the gaps of my young memory, which is still quite vivid.  I myself am now a carrier pilot in the Navy and have exhausted any skepticism that I had growing up of what I actually saw.  Much of which came from the two Piahute Indians I was with who ar!e extremely superstitious and would not talk about the sighting, nor acknowledge what it was at the time.  My younger brother, now 25 has a slight memory of the sighting as well.Sorry this is so long coming.  Just got internet.  Can draw picture if interested.<n>

My future wife &amp; i would sit and talk late into the night hours in her Chevy Vega at my parent&#39;s house. There were large old maple trees to the west, toward Saint Joseph, Mo. She worked second shift so we were usually up late into the night, sitting in the driveway. I grew up in the country, watching the night skies, used to the stars and their positions, i noticed a star directly to the north that&#39;d never been there. Then it was gone. Then it was back. As if it was turning a light on and off every minute or so. Then there appeared two bright lights behind the maple trees, to the west. Brighter than venus, i knew they must be airships of some sort, yet they didn&#39;t move. There is an airport across the river so at first i didn&#39;t think much of it. Then the &#34;light&#34; on the left, or south, began moving south while the other remained stationary. We passed it off as airplanes or something. Two nights later the same scenerio occured. I laughed as i got out of her Vega jokingly saying &#34;i&#39;m going up on the hill and see if something is there&#34;. There was. A ball of light was there as i walked out from behind an apple tree. About twenty feet up and about eighteen inches in diameter it stood perfectly still about eighty feet from me. It seemed at the time that i&#39;d suprised it. It sped off so fast that it disappeared nearly instantaneously to the west. I thought it&#39;d gone behind a tree limb. It seemed to me it &#34;knew&#34; i was there. It was aware. For several weeks i saw many &#34;lights&#34;. They hid behind trees. They imitated planes. They followed tree limbs as i watched them through binoculars. Everyone thought i was crazy. I can&#39;t forget it. Ten years went by and i was talking about it with my wife and she&#39;d forgotten it. She won&#39;t talk about it. She said she dosn&#39;t remember anything about it, yet she was there. The second time we saw the bright lights behind the trees, i felt we were being hypnotised and i actually covered her eyes with my hand saying &#34;don&#39;t look!&#34;, just an instinct, i guess...My father saw them one night and said it was just an airplane, but i&#39;d been watching them for a half hour and just before he spotted them, one of them turned on a flashing light and impersonated an airplane. It was very frustrating. I can&#39;t say how many &#34;lights&#34; i saw, or when, or if it ended....<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

It was after dusk and my mom was showing me one of the planets that were really bright in the sky. She had gone back inside and after a while I happened to look up and noticed a large triangular object overhead. We were at my aunts apartment and this helped me with gage the size of it.  The length of the craft was 2.5 to 3 times the length of her apartment building and the width was about 1.5 the length of the building.  I hovered, making no noise, about 3 telephone pole lengths above the height of a telephone pole. There were lights on the underside and sides visible that I have not seen since.  I remember looking up at it and then looking down to street level, ( I was in back patio area) and looking to the street only 20ft away, I saw a woman walking west.  All she had to do was look up and she would have saw it.  I went back insi! de and told my mom &#34;I need to show you something.&#34; she came out and I asked her to look up.  She looked up a little and said &#34;What?&#34; I told her to look up higher  a couple times and she looked up and saw it. I remember the look of her mouth dropping open and me asking her &#34;what is it?&#34;  She said she didn&#39;t know.  We watched it and it did move ever so slowly still no sound. It was still there but she decided to go to the phone booth and called the news stations and although they said there had been thousand of calls they could give no info and directed her to call the national guard.  She talked to someone and told them what we saw but they would give no information on  what it was but did ask what our names, ages, location of sighting, and social security numbers. We returned back to the apartment and talked to my aunts room mate and I remember her turning pale, not talking, and leaving. Later she told of following seeing several in the 82nd and Division area.  Forgive me for bei! ng long winded I just wish I knew what it was. I have searched! for loc al articles but have yet to see anything resembling what I saw.  Even other triangle pictures do not look like what i observed.  Can you help?<n>

I watched the jet for about 15 min. untill it was at about the 10 oclock position in the sky when it seemed to explode with a very large burst of light. When my eyes refocused it had become 2 points of light that were moving away from where I last saw the jet. One going east and one going west at equal speeds. Each reached the horizon in about 12 seconds and went out of sight. If a normal jet travels at 500 mph and I watched it for 15 min. how fast was it going to reach the horizon in 12 seconds?<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.

It happened when I was an early teen, but I remember that I still didn&#39;t have my drivers licence yet (I got it at 15 years old). That narrows it down to 1976 to 1978. Sorry. It&#39;s the best I can do.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The month is also an estimate. I remember it being a moonless warm night.)  My friend and I were about 14 and 17 respectively and on a clear night we were outside in his back yard looking through his telescope.  To our north, we saw five pale green spherical lights that were in a chevron pattern traveling due south at about 100 MPH, or less (estimate). At first, it seemed like lights outlining a single craft; but as they passed directly over our heads, we could clearly make out stars in between the &#34;Spheres&#34; of light. We realized that we were looking at 5 separate craft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were both (and still are) aviation fanatics. Both were taking flying/glider lessons and I was a later a member of the Civil Air Patrol. These spheres made no sound, had no exhaust traces or trails. They were not aircraft of any kind as we knew them. To estimate their size, I would say that if you held up a baseball at arms length, it would approximate their size (each) to the eye.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My friends yard is on the highest hill in the area. So, as they passed south of us, we could get a better estimate of size/altitude. It was late night so this is still very much an estimate: They were about 50-60 feet in diameter each. They were about 50 feet apart and were about 600 to 800 feet in the air.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As they passed over the next neighborhood south of us, one of the spheres lit an incredibly white light. It first pointed out to the right (east), then immediately aimed (snapped)down at something on the ground. We were astonished! As we watched, the spheres continued to travel south and the beam stayed &#34;locked&#34; on whatever it was it was being aimed at. That is to say, the beam stayed &#34;locked&#34; on one position on the ground as the spheres continued to move away. We could see it (the light) changing angle and broadening as they (the spheres) got further away. It (the light)then snapped off as fast as it had came on.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Within 2 minutes, they had passed below the horizon/tree line to our south and we lost sight of them. Then all hell broke loose. 2 F-4 Phantom fighters came screaming in from the Gulf of Mexico just to the south of us and we heard a double sonic boom. The following few days had various reports in the St. Pete Times about jets going after an unidentified &#34;small aircraft&#34;, people seeing strange lights in the sky along the coast and the windows in a Grants Department Store in New Port Richey, Florida had its front windows blown out by the sonic booms.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My friend called Macdill AFB the next day, which is a TAC base and asked about the goings on. He was told by a gentleman on the phone that the jets came from Tyndall AFB in Panama City. When asked why from so far away when we had the same jets at Macdill, his reply was something to the effect of: &#34;We just wanted to get there the fastest, with the mostest.&#34; He gave no further help.<n> <n><n> <n><n> These booms also caused a crack in my friends ceiling that remains to this day. I&#39;ve searched the St. Pete Times archives and can find nothing about the windows being blown out, or the sightings up and down the west coast that night, but I distinctly remember these events and the &#34;shaken&#34; locals of my (then) small seaside town.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of the sighting is approximate.

Often we&#39;d see objects on our radar and on a few occasions NORAD would scramble on them. (That&#39;s another topic).<n> <n><n> <n><n> The incident that I&#39;m reporting occurred after the end of my shift. Three of us were hanging around in the parking lot talking.  One controller made a comment that Venus was bright that night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We then started visibly scanning the sky.  We noticed a brighter light to the North of the ARTCC building and wondered if the other light in the sky was indeed  Venus, then what could that be. (The back door of the center faces east and leads to the back parking lot). The object was standing still and was just visible above the far tree line. Someone made a comment that it was probably a street light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> An airliner became visible climbing out of IAH but farther North of the light we were looking at.  The light then dimmed.  As the plane got farther away on its climb out, the light came back to the full density as we had seen before.  That got our attention.  We were wondering out loud what it could be.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At that moment,  the object moved from our left to our right at an extremely fast speed and stopped immediatley. almost a blur.  As fast as you can turn your head from 10 oclock to 2 oclock was the speed it seemed to move. (if east was 12 on the clock, then the object moved from 10 to 2).  We could not judge how far away from us it was.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object then just stood still for a minute or two.  Very bright red, blue and green lights starting flashing around the object.  A thin laser like beam of light, approximatley 6 to 12 inches in diameter, lit up part of the parking lot and starting scanning the parking lot.<n> <n><n> <n><n> All three of us ducked behind a car without saying a word.  The beam shut off and the flashing lights stopped.  The   white light on the object then came back on and the object began moving very slowly back to our ten oclock position and stopped at the exact location it was when we first noticied it.  We didn&#39;t say a word for about a minute.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When it sunk in what we had just seen, all three of us jumped in our cars and left for home.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The next day, we considered reporting this to a national hotline number in Washington D.C., that the FAA had provided us to report strange occurences that we observe on our radar screens (UFO&#39;s)  but no one ever  did for fear of losing our airman&#39;s certificate.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.

My dad came home about 9PM on his Honda 200. When he got off his bike in the back yard where our garage was. He noticed a glare on his visor. He looked up and there it was a craft approx 200feet across. About 60-100 feet up, it was just hovering there inching its way south towards highway 17, which, is now I-880. We lived on Norton Avenue, which is off of 1st Street near Avery Honda. 1st goes onto Stevens Creek Blvd. The craft was heading southward. No sound...just the light breeze of the evening blowing the 50-foot tree in our back yard. My dad yelled at us we heard him because we were in the living room and were waiting for him to come in since we heard his bike pull up. We went outside on the covered back porch. Dad told us &#34;look up&#34; I did My God! There it was this large circular craft burn marks on the edges, a bright whitish center extended from the bottom of the craft it was 30ft in diameter with multi colored lights surrounding it. These lights were an integral part of the extended bright white circle on the bottom. They formed the raised edge around the center bright white circle. We watched in awe as the craft slowly inched southward not even thinking to grab our Polaroid one step. The neighbor pulled up and stepped out of his car looked over at us and then looked up. I think it was the only time I heard him cuss. My dad went over to him on our side of the fence and asked do you see that? He looked at my dad and said, &#34;I see nothing at all!&#34; and then resumed looking up. As the craft moved southward me and my brother climbed up onto of the garage and watched it head southward. I could see the saucer shape the center of the craft was tall and spherical forming a half circle about half the diameter of the whole craft. The edge of this sphere shape slowly tapered to the outer edge of the craft where the bottom and top of the craft came together. The whole craft was symmetrical in design a circular saucer shaped craft. There were not sharp edges except the out! er edge and the protruding bottom white lit circle with multi colored edge. No lighting was visible from the top of the craft. My mom finally figured out about 20 minutes after the craft was out of sight to call the air force. Within 30 minutes there were an uncountable amount of aircraft in the air above south San Jose. I still wonder today if anyone else watched what I did that night. I will never forget it as long as I live!<n>

We started out in the woods about a half mile in, we came to a mountainess valley, and let our dogs off the leash to run.  After a few minutes, we happened to look into the sky and saw a large dish shaped object, dark grey in color, against a green mountain background so we could really see it clearly.  It was about three quarters of a mile away and looked very large to us.  As we looked at it in awe,two smaller objects came out of the rear or side of the large object.  This object made no sound or had no lights or windows that we could see.  Whe we witnessed this, we called our dogs in and ran back to our trucks.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date is approximate.  PD))<n>
8/1/76 17:00|Lockport (near Selkirk) (Canada)|MB|Light|1-2 minutes|White light deposited two red lights and then zipped off into the sky.|7/1/02|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/023/S23438.html|28|ndxe197608| White light deposited two red lights and then zipped off into the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This an experience that I shared with my brother who is five years my elder.  At the time I was only  6 years old and my brother 11.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were standing in back of our house and both noticed a white light shoot down, stop,  then two red lights slowly shot down to the ground.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then the original white light shot back up into the sky much faster than when it came in and disappeared.   The whole incident took a good one to two minutes.  Not just something you see out of the corner of your eye.  We sat there and observed it discussing it with each other as it happened.  We may have been young but we know what we saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were both so certain that something alien had been deposited on earth and we wanted to check it out all though I was scared.  It was then our mother called us in for dinner and she didn&#39;t believe our story.  She insisted we eat dinner first and then allowed my brother to go search for whatever had been deposited.   When my brother went out armed only with his BB gun I was both scared for him and curious, hoping he&#39;d find proof of our sighting.   Unfortunately he came back empty handed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Now 31 &amp; 36 my brother and I recently were visiting when my brother asked if I had remembered our experience.  We found it rather eerie that we both remembered it exactly the same way to the detail in the same place all these years later.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We&#39;re certain It was not fireworks or any other man made device.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There are no military bases anywhere near our family home.  It seemed as though it were very close say one mile away but that could have been deceiving.   There&#39;s a floodway running behind our house and it seemed as though that was where the lights should have gone.  They may have landed as far away as Bird&#39;s hill park which was about 10 miles away. We were unable to make out a ship or anything other than the lights, it seemed very close but still was no more than a bright light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thanks for allowing a venue to tell our story, people tend to look at you funny when you tell such a story, particularly because of our age at the time.  But how could we both remember something which scared us so much so closely,  Our memory of the event is identicle.  And it happened 25 years ago!

I WAS DRIVING HOME ABOUT MIDNIGHT. I WAS DRIVING A 1969 OLDSMOBILE 88. I WAS JUST ENTERING THE TOWN OF GEORGETOWN VIA THE OLD CITY PARK ROAD. THERE IS A STOP SIGN RIGHT BEFORE YOU HAVE TO MAKE A LEFT TO ENTER THE PARK. I PULLED UP TO THE STOP SIGN AND STOPPED. I WAS DRIVING BY MYSELF, AND THERE WERE NO CARS BEHIND ME OR IN FRONT OF ME. I WAS STOPPED AT THE STOP SIGN AND SUDDENLY THERE WAS A BRIGHT, BLINDING LIGHT DIRECTLY IN FRONT OF ME. THE WIDTH OF THE LIGHT WAS ABOUT 30 FEET WIDE. THE NEXT THING I REMEMBER, I AM SITTING IN MY CAR AND IT IS 6:00 AM IN THE MORNING. MY CAR IS RUNNING AND IT IS STOPPED RIGHT WERE IT WAS WHEN I SAW THE LIGHT. THE CAR IS NOW IN PARK INSTEAD OF THE DRIVE POSITION. THIS WAS THE ONLY THING THAT I NOTICED. I PUT THE CAR IN DRIVE AND TURNED THEN I NOTICED THE TIME. I HAVE NO MEMORY OF WHAT HAPPENED DURING THOSE 6 HOURS. SHORTLY AFTER THIS EVENT, I NOTICED TWO SMALL BUMPS ON THE BACK OF M! Y HEAD AT THE BASE OF THE SKULL. THERE WERE NO MARKS JUST THE TWO SMALL BUMPS. THEY ARE STILL THERE TO THIS DAY. THE BUMPS NEVER HURT , OR CAUSED ME ANY PAIN. AFTER THAT EVENT I DID NOTICE A COUPLE OF THINGS THAT I HAD NEVER NOTICED BEFORE. FIRST, EVERY WATCH I EVER WORE ON MY WRIST AFTER THAT WOULD RUN A FOR A WHILE AND THEN JUST STOP. I COULD SET THE WATCH DOWN AND IT WOULD ALWAYS RUN FINE. IF I PUT IT BACK ON IT WOULD STOP. THIS WAS THE SAME WITH EVERY WATCH I PUT ON MY WRIST. I BOUGHT A POCKET WATCH AND WOULD CARRY IT IN MY POCKET AND IT WOULD WORK FINE. IT IS STILL THAT WAY TO THIS DAY. SECONDLY, I NOTICED EVERY TIME I PUT A PHONE UP TO MY RIGHT EAR IT WOULD MAKE A LOUD HIGH PITCHED BACK FEEDING SOUND. THAT IS THE SAME SIDE THAT THE TWO SMALL BUMPS ARE AT THE BASE OF MY SKULL. TODAY SOME PHONES I USE MAKE THE BACK FEEDING NOISE AND SOME DO NOT. I CAN HOLD ANY PHONE TO MY LEFT EAR AND I NEVER DID GET THE BACK FEEDING NOISE. I NEVER TOLD THIS TO ANYONE FOR MANY YEARS. I ! TOLD MY WIFE AND KIDS MANY YEARS LATER, AND NO ONE ELSE UNTIL ! I TOLD A FEW OTHER FAMILY MEMBERS TWO MONTHS AGO. I GUESS ITS TIME TO MAKE THE REPORT NOW, SO I AM.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I looked in the direction where it came from. It was very dark in the rocky surroundings to my right side. Then from out of the woods in those rocks came up a saucer-like form, distance approx. 200 mtr., big, it had in the middle part a dark ring, which meant to me that it&#39;s lights were out.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It circled from the bush and disappeared.Because there was some light from the moon I could see its shape very well, and its metallic glow.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It all took, from the first sound until it was gone, about 5 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.
