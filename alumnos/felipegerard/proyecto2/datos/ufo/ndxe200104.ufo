Many years ago I had some buddies show me some video tape of this thing they call THE METHOD..  It was a way to catch UFO on video or on film..  If you recall, When there is a eclips of the sun.. THere are many reports of sighting especially in souther America.. This was the principle of my friends way of spotting UFOs in the sky..  You stand in the shadow of a roof or building not looking derectly at the sun but around the corona of it.   You will obiviously see insects flying by but if you focus your eyes way up.. at about the hight of a commercial jet, there are things you can only see when they are lit up by a reflection of the sun..  I have been a witness to this many times..  Seeing pear necklace shaped objectes, chess piece objects and sphere shaped objects..  One time I saw this object that look as if it was spining. After it was way past the brightness of the sun I tracked it moving across the San Fernando Valley.  it was the same color of the sky, and if i didnt spot its reflection, ther would be no way of seeing it with the naked eye..  I have shared this method with many friends..  I am not the originator of this principle, and do not want to be sued by who ever discovered it..  So, the other night I was on the balcony of my apartment building..  It was late at night, about midnight..  There was a marine layer coming it from the south, and a fog of some sort coming from the north..  The night sky was not that clear above but getting overcast..  You could see some stars above but not much on either side of the sky.. I was only out there a min when I saw what seemed like when you see a grocery bag in the sky when there is a wind kicking up, but it was not windy..  It was the same color of the cloudy sky on both sides of the sky.. It made no sound..  And it traveled from east to west across the sky..  Very low.  Aout 500 feet I would say..  I thought it might be a balloon from a car dealership around here, but it was no! t perfec tly round like a balloon..  I cannot say how big it was,  Maybe the size of a small car.. or as large as a 747 jet..  It was spinning and seemed to cloak itself with it seroudings..  I was only able to see it when it when though the clear area of the sky, and I was able to track it, but then it stopped..  I got very scared and went inside..  After that I herd a helecopter go by in the same derection..  Has there been any new sevalance craft that the US, or and other countries might be looking at us??  I would think, or has this been something of a UFO origen??  I do not do drugs or drink..  I am very interested in finding more info about this type of craft, that can acually cloak itself with its surrondings..  Thanks for any ifo..<n>

My friend was the passenger and reported seeing something strange outside her window.  She said there were lights following us.  I thought perhaps it was a reflection from a near-by carnival or something, so, when I got the opportunity, I looked as to try and quell her uneasiness.  Then I saw it as well.  It was about 10-12 blue slashes of light in an oval shape.  Once again I thought it was an reflection of something, but when it followed us from half-way between DC and Baltimore to Baltimore, I knew it was no such thing.  I was driving about 75 mph and it kept pace with the car for quite a while.  It stopped follwing us once we passed some sort of military base.  I believe there is an Air Force base in Dundalk, Md, but I&#39;m not sure.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>
4/30/01 15:47|Marietta|GA|Triangle|10 seconds|Triangle shaped craft hovered over trees and then disappeared into nothing|8/5/01|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/017/S17486.html|3|ndxe200104| Triangle shaped craft hovered over trees and then disappeared into nothing<n> <n><n> <n><n> As said, there were two witnesses to this &#39;craft&#39;. I have never reported anything of such before, mainly because I do my own research, but this needed to be heard. Two of us were in a car driving up a road from where I live, and we saw what first appeared to be a helicopter flying very low, the person with me even remarked that it was in fact one, but it was only a few feet above the trees, no more and no less. The altitude of this craft was amazingly low, and when I finally caught it with my own eyes, it had a triangular shape to it I could not find any evidence of blades on the craft. Now, of the one thing I am certain...it was not any type of helicopter mainly for two reasons. First, it made no sound, and second there would be some type of physical activity in that general area of the craft for it being that low in altitude. (Mainly, the wind velocity causing branches to sway, etc...) After seeing the craft, it seemed to have had a &#39;sense&#39; of something and it finally darted back behind the trees (Tall pines). It did not take us more than 3 seconds to drive to where we could see behind the trees and into full sky view where any normal object would clearly be in view. It was gone...there was nothing. From going back to the &#39;site&#39; I have not found anything, all I know is that I consider this one of the greatest sightings I have seen myself in quite a while. Certainly, I have not witnessed one that close. Broad daylight made it that much more spectacular. There was not a cloud in the sky, and you could see the metallic sheen of the craft. It truly was fascinating...And my eyes will be open to maybe capturing the image of it soon, if in fact it does show again.<n>

The lights seemed to be racing eachother, but in a hurry to get to a destination.  We watched them move quickly then pause then quickly again and then they disappeared.  Approximately 5 minutes later, we saw three lights holding formation of a triangle, but clearly they were three seperate lights moving with the same speed and manuverability as the two we saw beforehand.  We aren&#39;t sure that there were only three, but they seemed to be the same so we assume there was one light (vessel) the other two needed to get...PURELY SPECULATION... but that is what we saw...<n>

Par la suite, j&#39;ai continué à regarder vers la Grande Ours et un objet se dirigea du Sud-Ouest vers le Nord-Est.  Il s&#39;agissait d&#39;un objet contenant deux lumières pâles semi-transparentes se déplançeant à une altitute des satellites à une vitesse approximative aux alentours de 25000km/h.  Cette fois-ci il était seul car j&#39;avais déjà vu ce type d&#39;objets à trois en 1999 (le 14 avril 99).  Je fus stupéfait car je croyais qu&#39;il s&#39;agissait de &#34;flair Irridium&#34; mais je pense que ce n&#39;était pas le cas. Cet objet avait une trajectoire rectiligne et n&#39;avait aucune réflexion du soleil.  Il est en forme de 2 semi-boucliers comme un oiseau donc chacune de ses ailes avait un point qui éclairait.  Il n&#39;y avait aucun son selon l&#39;effet de Doppler.  Surprenante observation.  Je croyais être le seul à voir ce genre<n>

Bright enough to be seen thru peripheral vision.  From the time that I first saw it to the time I lost it was about 4 and a half minutes.  It was while I was driving home, and by the time I got home and used binaculars it was gone.<n>

The star (object) on the left side started to move away from the other stars... slowly at first then it just took off. Here is a picture... * &lt;stars (objects) &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; *      * the object moved in this direction, it was not a falling star o  &lt;moon     *  * &lt;stars<n>

It appeared too bright to be a plane.  It did not seem to grow or diminish in brightness for a full 2 minutes. Then, the light just seemed to quickly dim until it could not bee seen.  It didn&#39;t simply wink off, nor did it seem to fly away, it just seemed to shut off as one would see when quickly turning off a light using a dimmer switch. There was no sound heard, and the distance from us to the object could not be estimated.  As far as I can tell, the object could have been out in deep space or just over the hills in the distance.  I work a help desk for a communications company in Las Vegas. I was visiting the hot springs with two friends, niether of which saw this, as they were facing me, but there were four others there and one of the others also saw what I did.<n>

It was dusk, though I was able to clearly make out the craft as it flew overhead. As I looked closer, I noted that the white balls were attached to the bottom of a chevron shaped glider type craft. It made no noise that I could discern. It seemed somewhat low to the ground and was silent. It was not brightly illuminated. We observed it for approximately 25-30 seconds... p.s. On November 14, 1982, I saw another flying object in this same area when I was a student at UCLA!<n>

My girlfriend saw something in the sky and I turned to look.  It was capsule shaped (like a pill).  I thought it may have been a hot air baloon, but there was no cabin,no engine, ailerons, external devices etc.   About the size of a bus, white, traveling approx 120-150 mph heading directly north.  Altitude approx 1,000&#39; AGL.  No engine sound or other, no vapor trails. It was moving in conjunction and just in front (by a couple hours) of a cold front which lasted about a week. I noticed that local residents, including my baby developed cold symptoms for about a week.<n>
4/29/01 16:35|London (Canada)|ON|Light|25 minutes|Stationary lights in the day  sky over London Ontario.|8/5/01|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/017/S17458.html|13|ndxe200104| Stationary lights in the day  sky over London Ontario.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At approx. 6:35 E.S.T. we were sitting outside on the patio. It was a clear blue sky, I was watching planes flying overhead. I had seen about 10 planes go over in about 15 minutes. All the planes had two contrails , then one flew over going west this plane had 4 contrails that stayed in the sky for a longer period of time than the other planes that had 2 contrails. About 10 minutes later a plane flying east had 4 contrails  as this plane past over I noticed the plane pass another object with no contrail. I watched the object with no contrail. It was stationary. At first I thought it was a parachutists. After about 30 seconds I still did not notice it moving. I pointed out the object to the other person with me. She also saw it in the sky. The object appeared to be very high up in the sky. I than thought it might be the space lab reflecting the sunlight. Than out of no where three more objects appeared to the left of the 1st sighted object. These objects formed a triangle that would hold constant shape for about two minutes. The triangle would remain a triangle but two of the objects would get closer while the third would get further away. Then their triangle would get smaller. All the while the larger object remained to the left of the triangle. I called my wife out to see this. She brought out her camera and we took a couple of pictures. I got my binoculars and tried to get a closer look. What I saw was a faint blue light going between the white lights forming the triangle. When I looked at the bigger object to the left of the white lights forming the triangle I saw another blue light in the bigger object. This lasted about 20 to 25 minutes. Than another larger plane with no contrails appeared to fly out of the eastern sky at the objects. The plane veered off the the south after getting near the spot of the objects. About 4 to 5 minutes later the objects were gone from sight. They may have past over the horizon but did not appear to.<n>

They were directly overhead at the time of the sighting. The path they took appeared to be slow with variations in speed and slight changes in direction. The distance between the objects is hard to estimate but appeared to be quite far. The altitude for each may have been different as well as one appeared to be easier to see than the others. The objects appeared to be lights that never blinked or changed in brightness. The weather conditions were very good for this day -- clear skys, very little haze. I&#39;ve never seen a weather balloon, but the paths the objects took seemed to indicate a light-weight object traveling wind currents. I have video of the &#34;closest&#34; object.<n>

They moved as a group from East toward West. They did not move in straight lines but did move in an irregular or sporatic nature. There was NO sound! Not during nor after they passed from view. We were only able to see them for about 20 seconds. They seemed to be at least 5 miles high, possibly much higher. They did not look like any known aircraft. We are 49 and 52 year old married couple. Well educated, professional adults. We have never before seen any UFO&#39;s. It was absolutely amazing!<n>

It had gone from point A to point B in the flash of an eye and we think it knew that since it was a bright, moonlight night, that we just might be able to see the craft, thus its speedy demise this time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We know that this thing is real; just wish we could see exactly what in this world, or out of  it, that it is?<n>

Facing south roughly, I saw to my right a star move. Of course stars do not move and I soon realized I was seeing a craft move gracefully across the sky. Maybe it began at Orion, I cannot say. It was soundless and would seem to have been 2000 metres up. I say this as I got a clear look at it as it passed the full moon. It was made of dull triangular metal. I tried to pass it off as a ballon but a ballon would have gone stright up, this thing, moved from horizon to horizon then disppeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

I skated a little bit up and down the side walk a car went bar shortly after I went into the road I moved out of the way then I went back out there and all the sudden as I gazed up at the sky this orange/yellow ball object came out of no where which also seemed to be pretty far away from where I was like close to the stars Well It Inteligently flew around and Dissapeared. I have never seen anything like this before But I was thinking Omg ((deleted)). Wow haha. That&#39;s probably dumb because I have no idea what it was but  Who Knows. It really didn&#39;t look like a weather Balloon To me! Haha PS: Even if I had gotten the  chance to take a picture!

On the particular day as I was watching a commerical flight returning to Lag. airport, I noticed two objects come into view. They were at a very high altitude compared to the commeriacal jet flights. Both were white in color and oval in shape. They were traveling in a west to east direction and at a very rapid speed, since they were out of sight within 10 seconds or less. The unuseual part of this sighting is that the very next day (04/29/01), I was on my roof with binoculars watching the commerical aircraft. To my astonishment two exact same objects came into my view. This was something that in all my years of sky watching I have never expierenced. Both sight- ings were indentical as far as color and shape go, but on my second sight- ing the objects were traveling in a north to south direction. I hope this info can add to other sightings that may have been noticed on these days. If so, please E-Mail me at (((e-address deleted)).). Thank You, ((name deleted)) ing the objects were traveling from a north to south direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((SECOND REPORT FROM SAME WITNESS))<n> <n><n> <n><n> In all my years of sky watching I have never before seen anything of this nature.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On this the I noticed two objects that were white and oval in shape. Both were flying flying side by side from the north west and turning to the east. The object on the right was steady, but the object of the left was moving form right to left and back to front of the other. As I mentioned, both were perfectly oval and white in color. On this same day I later went onto my roof with binoculars to follow air traffic of commerical flights that pass over my house going to Laguardia airport. While watching the sky I suddenly spotted which seemed to be the same objects I had noticed earlier that day. Both were oval and white in color, but this time both were fling side by side and steady. With my binoculars I can possitivly say they were both white and oval in same...no wings what so ever.<n>

It was moving at a very high rate of speed with only one light to be seen from the ground and one other light underneath which pulsed intermittantly. I have watched the skies for many years because I am an aircraft enthusiast, but I have no doubt that this was no man-made aircraft simply due to the high rate of speed that it traveled at. It didn&#39;t zig-zag or anything, but it cleared the length of the sky in under 2 minutes. I would estimate it&#39;s altitude at 10,000 feet. This object made no sound which also leads me to believe that it was not a man-made craft.<n>

I steped out the back door and glanced up at the sky and noticed that the the sky was about 60% overcast with wispy clouds, I turned to look to the north west and all of the sudden I saw a round light about the size of a silver dollar at arms length showing through the clouds, moving from approx 290 degrees heading southeast. As I turned rapidly to follow the path visually, it seemed to alter its course approx 10 degrees ( this was not an arc correction but almost a bent angle) My brain could not accept what my eyes had just seen. There is no way to estimate the altitude or speed of the object, as it was above the cloud layer. I have given this very deep thought for 3 days before attempting to write this down, as the whole episode has been very unsettling for me.<n>

But when we got back into the care an hour and fortyfive min. had passed. But it did not seem that long. I remeber seeing the object that was about 80 feet in dia. has a row of what I would call ports but I have no idea what the real purpose of them are. It had a raised center peice at the top with an outline of a hatch. Side of the hatch was a window and in it we saw a figure moving about inside but was unable to make it out. The next thing we remember we were geting back in the car. We all took a vote and said that we would not report it to the local polic because of what happen some years ago when we had a big ufo flap and the person who reported it was hounded and put down in public.<n>

Looking straight up I saw a line of light in the sky that my first reaction was that Oh its a shooting star. But the light didn&#39;t fade out like a shooting star would and the light didn&#39;t move in a downward motion but in a horizontal movement across the sky. Then I realized I&#39;m looking at lit up side or a reflecting side or edge of an object. My next reaction was that I must be seeing an owl gliding across the night sky trying to rationalize this when I immediately realized this is no owl. I could make out the sides of a 3 sided object dark as the night sky itself but the sides were just barely visible. I felt that rather then looking at just a dark object, not lit up that I felt it was camouflaged to the night sky. I don&#39;t know how to explain that but that&#39;s a feeling that went through me. My reaction in a split second was &#34;how sneaky this thing is&#34;. I want to say it was not lit, it seemed as black and void as the night sky, but I was able to make out the 3 sides. I&#39;m not sure if it was reflections or actual lights very dim that shown its form, but I could make out its shape. No doubt though at what I was seeing even as quick as it was I was able to get a clear view and take it all in. 3 sided, like a guitar pick shape.When it passed in front of the stars the shape was also that much more easier to decern. Heading west to east. When it was out of sight I even thought to hold my hand out in the sky to try to judge the size it took up in the sky. When I held my hand out I would say that it was the size of half of my hand size. It was not a far off object I was looking at. Marine helicopters fly through this corridor daily heading for The Miramar Base, this object seemed to be moving at about that or  just above that height that the helicopters fly at. What that elevation is I dont know but that is the best way for me to judge what height in the sky the object seemed to be. Not a sound, and because there was no sound ! and it m oved at a tremendous speed my mind was searching for a different word then flying. It was one of those things where if you weren&#39;t looking in just the right spot at the right time you would never have seen it, it was so stealthy. I saw it from directly over my head and disappear past the mountains in the east 10 miles away in 5 seconds. Once it was out of sight I stood staring at the sky for another 15 minutes trying to understand what the heck could it have been and thinking perhaps I might see it again. The frustration of not being able to understand what could be that shape, that quiet, that dark and move at that rate of speed, made me not even want to think about it at all until I spoke to my wife about it the next day. I couldn&#39;t fit it into a box in my mind or relate it to anything Ive ever seen, and that can be frustrating. Do we have something that can move at night like this ? If we dont then someone does, there is NO doubt about that in my mind now. I&#39;m sending a little drawing of how it looked to me as I looked up at what I would guess was its underside. Side A is the edge I first noticed glimmering that I thought was a line of light in the sky that was a shooting star. Side B would be the side closest to me looking up and the front was the portion of the object that was at the head of it moving towards the east.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with this witness at length, and we found him to be exceptionally eloquent, lucid in his description of the object he allegedly witnessed, and able to describe it precisely.

It was 9:50pm.  As I reached the area adjacent to West Seattle, I spotted a light in the sky, which at first I took for an aircraft inbound to Boeing Field or Seatac Intl. Airport.  However, after less than a minute, I looked up again and noticed that the light had not moved and that I, rather, was moving toward this light which hovered midair above the neighborhood on the East side of the highway, approximately 70 to 100 feet up.  As I drove past the object, I looked at it through my sunroof and wondered if it was a helicopter.  I noticed the counter-clockwise cycling strobes of white lights tracing the pattern of a diamond under the craft while two or more other white lights glowed without flashing.  Moments later, I saw a second identical object on the same side of the highway less than 200 feet North of the original one.  As I scanned the skyline, I realized that two more identical stationary craft were hovering above the downtown area at approximately the same height.  After an accidental detour due to the distraction, at the James Avenue exit, I returned to the highway and proceeded toward the University District where I saw two more on my right (East) and another on my left which was moving.  I watched the moving object, which passed above me NW to SE about 100 feet up.  After it passed out of my field of vision, I watched another hovering, stationary craft with bright blue and red blinking lights remeniscent of a police light bar.  At this point I decided to pull over and get out of my vehicle when the next one came into view.  As I drove on, I did not witness any others.  At this time I switched on the Art Bell show, just beginning. Before the program, local KOMO Seattle news had nothing to report on the matter and Neither did Art Bell or his callers.  All of the craft, with the exception of one were identical and behaved like helicopters or Harrier jets.! Becaus e of their apparent size, I first believed the craft to be double rotor helicopters.  I looked around at other motorists driving beside me but there were no other noticeable witnesses.<n>

As they got closer I saw there were 8 separte objects, eliptical in shape and all about an 1/8 inch in diameter if you held a ruler at arms length. The intensity of the lights never changed but they didn&#39;t glow like normal lights. They were dull and there was no glare. They were edging each other out much like race cars down the final stretch but still maintained more or less a close V-shape and appeared to glide rather than fly as they passed overhead at about my 1 o&#39;clock position. I estimated their altitude to be about 20,000 ft. Their speed was incredible, covering about 90 degress of sky in about 5 seconds and were completely silent.<n>

The form changed from what would appear to be an oval or sphere into something resembling at times a cross.  The object also changed luminescence, at times opaque and bright then dark, almost invisible. At the time it did not appear to be a correlation between the shape changes and the changes in luminescence.  The speed appeared constant, meaning not accelerating or deccelerating, however the shape changes may have effected this. Another important note however is that there was no audible noise.<n>

An object about 1/2 degree wide rose over the hill in the east and crossed over the whole sky before disappearing over the west horizon.  No sound.  Seemed wierd because there were 3 lights constantly illuminted and rotating around the whole body. It was in the same path that the planes fly, but I&#39;ve never seen anything like it.  There was no way to judge distance.  I&#39;ve spent years outside w/my scope, but nothing like it.<n>

My &#34;sub-division&#34;  is located between Gurnee to the East and Grayslake to the West. My house is one street or half a block off Route 45, 2 ½ blocks North of  Route 120 and just South of Gages Lake.  Looking out my back door window which gives me a panoramic view of the East edge of Grayslake including portions of the Lake County Fair Grounds which are both located just on the other side of Route 45.  Actually the back of my lot borders Grayslake since the lots fronting Route 45 have been &#34;taken&#34; by Grayslake recently. That evening looking out the kitchen door window, checking as a security measure before retiring I looked up and over towards Grayslake and just above the power lines I notice two rather large glowing objects in a stationary position.  I looked at my watch for a moment, unbelieving what I saw, it was about 2 minutes before midnight.  I quickly looked again and they were still there in the exact position in which I first spotted them.  I was awestruck and was waiting for movement, but it never occurred for about 5 minutes.  Then suddenly, the one on my left, and a little lower then the other one suddenly started moving away towards the West until I lost sight of it.  It moved out very fast but was not instantaneous and I was watching it as it departed. The other object stayed, and I wanted to get my binoculars which were in the dinning room just off the kitchen, but I hesitated figuring I would miss something.  But after a couple more minutes, without movement, I took a chance and dashed into the dining room, found the binoculars and took them out of the case and got back to the window.  This movement on my part took no more than 1-2  minutes.  As I returned the object was still there, and as I raised the binoculars up it started moving westward, just as the other one had done earlier.  Unfortunately by the time I got the binoculars focused, it was completely gone. The objects were observed as rather large lights, but they had a oblong symmetrical shape and while watching, I had the sensation that something zoomed past my window just above the roof of my house.  It happened so fast, I&#39;m still not sure it happened, since I was mainly focusing on the two lights off to the distance.  I heard no noise, nor did I even think to go outside and try and get a better view. I have mentioned my sighting to some of my associates at work, and some of my family members, but I really can&#39;t confirm what they were, the only thing I know is that they were there, were stationary for several minutes and were not airplanes of which I have seen many times before.  Within the last few years it has been common to see many aircraft routed around O&#39;Hare flying nearby, but those are always moving and do not provide the large light these objects did.  I feel they were UFO&#39;s and that means just what it is intended to stand for, &#34;Un-Identified Flying Objects&#34;.<n>

Then at that speed, it made a 180 degree turn within 3 seconds, still leaving a trail.  Then about 5 seconds after it turned it disappeared.  I kept looking for about a minute or so and saw the object again, (no trail) going west then east then west again, all in a span of ten or fifteen seconds, then disappered.<n>

The project we were on was over budget and we didn&#39;t want to stay another night in Kingman.  We worked until about 8pm and then hit the road.  My partner was driving.  I had my feet up on the dash of the passenger seat in our work van.  Suddenly out of the corner of my eye I saw a very intense light orange colored light in the sky.  The light was about 10000  to 15000 ft in the air (approximately) and was shaped like a circle.  At first glance I thought it was a flare, but it had no light tracer and it held its position in the sky.  Then as that light faded, another appeared directly below it, faded, and another below it.  In what appeared to be a perfectly straight line. Then another light appeared to the right of the bottom most light in the vertical line, faded and then another light appeared and then faded.  It seemed to form an &#34;L&#34; shaped pattern in the sky.  My partner and I convinced each other that it was just something strange and unexplainable but not extraterrestrial.  We were in a hurry to get back to Phoenix traveling at about 85 mph.  About 5 minutes down the road from the first sighting, We saw another light exactly the same as what we had just witnessed.  This time the lights were more spuratic and didn&#39;t appear to form any particular shape.  The lights also appeared and faded the same as in the first sighting. There must have been about 5 more light appearances for a total of 11.  I remembered the sightings in Phoenix a couple of years ago that made the news.  I remember being very skeptical about the sightings then, now I am a firm believer.  This obeject(s) I witnessed was exactly what was described over the city of Phoenix.  another note: my first thought  was that it was lights reflecting off of clouds or something to that affect but then I took a look out my side window and found not a single cloud in the sky.  I could see every star!<n>

As they approached the point of being directly overhead, they began to dart in different directions, like fire-flies buzzing around each other while at the same time, maintaining their general course (west, south-west to east, north/east.  The amount of distance they were covering in such short time with each swerve and the erratic changes in directions struck me as impossible for any aircraft I know.  They were too small, too far away and flying in too coordinated a manner to be insects or birds (and the quality of light looked exactly like a star).  The objects seemed to accelerate in the general direction they had been traveling to begin with, as if they were again flying in a more unison and coordinated fashion.  At this point they flew over the roof of my house and I was unable to find them afterward.<n>

To the south east at the point of a bright star, there was one very bright object moving south to north.

A few seconds later the same or another burst came on the same path and disapeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  The description is not inconsistent, we observe, with a tumbling satellite, or rocket booster, but it should have continued to be visible as it moved to the north, I.e. &#34;toward&#34; the sun, which would have been shining over the north-northwest horizon at this time of night.

The light first appeared as a normal aircraft light traveling from north to south but was moving at such a speed that we had some trouble following it with our eyes, the light flashed at what appeared about the same rate as an aircraft light but was moving so fast that we only saw 4 flashs from the time we first saw it looking due west untill it disappeared over the southern horizon. The veiw from where we observed this light is unobstructed for about 800 meters. The weather had been raining off and on all day and though the rain had stopped at the time of sighting the sky was still heavy with cloud leading me to believe that the craft was at a low altitude but there was no sound to be heard. The duration of sighting was approximatly 4 seconds. In short I was totally astonished at the speed of this craft, after years of being around and observing military aircraft I have never seen anything move this fast.<n>

The trees were partially blocking my view of it. I cannot guess it&#39;s altitude any closer than that it was above the trees. It made no sound. It went it a perfectly straight line, seemed to be traveling level with the ground (just a guess). It moved smoothly and initially I assumed it was something falling. The time of 22:30 is approximate.<n>
4/25/01 19:00|San Felipe (Mexico)||Cylinder|0:2:00|Bright light following cylindrical nose, near ground, moving linearly southward without noise or trail.|8/5/01|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/017/S17630.html|52|ndxe200104| Bright light following cylindrical nose, near ground, moving linearly southward without noise or trail.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((name deleted)), a (( XX))-year-old, semi-retired building contractor residing in Yuma, Arizona was vacationing at his summer home about 35 miles south of San Felipe on the east coast of Baja California.  This area is about 150 miles south of the U.S. - Mexico border.  While there in early evening of 25 April 2001, he saw a bright object moving steadily south over the Sea of Cortez, about 30 degrees above the eastern horizon.  It was his impression that it was reflecting the sun, which had just set.  He grabbed the binoculars he keeps handy for watching animal life and saw in front of the bright reflection what appeared to be a cylindrical nose.  When asked if he could see any other structural detail, he said: &#34;Although the object appeared to be reflecting the sun, the sky was too dark to see any other detail.  If it had had wings, I doubt I could have seen them.&#34;  He was quite certain the object was no more than 500 - 1000 feet up, much lower than the aircraft which fly over that area.  He will not estimate his distance from the object.  But at 30 degrees elevation, trigonometry gives distance to the object as twice its height above eye level, or 1000 - 2000 feet.  He heard no sound whatsoever and saw no trail.  Sighting duration from first appearance as the object came out of shadows until it reentered them again on its southward linear path was about two minutes.  Weather was clear, calm, beautiful, and about 70 Fahrenheit. Mr. ((deleted)) was not a UFO believer previously but is unable to relate this object to any previously-seen aerial objects and concludes it was some kind of UFO.  Because of the low altitude, he rejects an earth-satellite explanation.  Moreover, the object would have been moving in an unusual, polar orbit.<n>

I thought it was a small airplane or a remote control airplane. It glinted white silver and then red. I watched it pass over the highway and out of my side window I seen that it had no wings. It was flying in a straight SW to NW direction, pointy end first, it seemed to be quite small about 5 or 6 feet in length 3 or 4 high. I had a very good look at it as it was only approx.1/4 KM away. I pulled off of the highway but by the time I stopped I had lost sight of it.<n>

There was a small triangular shaped craft in the air. We both looked to see if it could possibly be wings of a plane, but if they were, there was no back end of the plane. It had some sort of bright &#39;headlight&#39; leading its course which I myself have never seen on an airplane. On the extruding side, it had small green lights on each end, but i have been familiar with only red ones on a plane, but never in pairs. The wierd thing the two of us noticed was that from its low altitude, it was not making the slightest noise. Our town was quiet as could be at 3:40 AM also. Another wierd thing about the craft, was that it was hoovering, not as much flying. It was late, neither one of us were drastically tired, intoxicated, nor had any drugs in our bodies and are truthfull behind what we saw. This may have been an airplane, because there are 3 airports in a 50 mile radius, but, a triangular airplane, with side green lights, and a bright headlight?<n>

Pointing it out to me-- white and orange lights vaguely showed through the distance.  Just only several miles down the road, it was directly prior to our van.  I was driving, while my boyfriend hung out the window-- staring at what he knew was not a terrestrial spacecraft.  Describing it, he still hesitates in his own amazement.  &#34;It was the length of a football field, and width of two jumbo-jet planes, but it had no wings.  Moving in complete silence, it must have traveled up to thousanth&#39;s in the mile while heading downward, and then haulting to a hovering pace.&#34; Estimating we were driving at about 70 mi/hr--braking to about 60; the spacecraft must have slowed to a mere 40-45 mi/hr. It came about about 1/25 a mile away from my boyfriend.  Seeing it face-foward, he described a large window, defining it as more of an entrance, possibly, than an outlook.  The lights were of a variety. Seeing blue, red, yellow, orange, and white, they stood solid, with no flickers or blinks. We proceeded to travel west and looking back notice the object hovered above a tree and house. Emitting a bright triangular like shroud of light in the dark of night, giving us the ability to see the tree and house from our distance. Demonstrating an output of what seemed to be an unending power. THIS WE HAD SEEN TOGETHER, IT IS TRUE... AND DESCRIBED TO THE BEST OF OUR KNOWLEDGE.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  The precise date and time are in question.  We will attempt to confirm them.  PD))<n>

I was lying in my hot tub and gazing up at the night sky. Suddenly a flight of 6 objects flying in a east by north east direction (approximate heading 080) at a fairly high rate of speed appeared at about 70 degrees azimuth to me. I live on the coastline, so the craft were coming in from over the ocean. No idea of altitude, but high enough where I could not see any detail on the craft. All craft appeared to be exactly the same. The craft gave off a faint whitish glow (a slight cast of yellow), just enought to make them visible. The craft were in perfect separation. After passing overhead, three of the craft broke off and changed heading to approx. 070. The other three maintained course for approx. 1-2 seconds, then joined up on the first three. Perfect separation was maintained at all times. No sound was heard. The craft dissappeared several seconds later, still headed approx. 070. At first I thought they were birds, then jets, since I used to fly jets in the service (A-4&#39;s). What got me was the sudden brake off movement of the first three, with no roll movement observed when they changed course. They seemed to simply &#34;translate&#34; over, for want of a better word. Also the speed seemed very high, and the separation was too perfect. I have seen many flight demonstration teams, but nothing like that. Flying that type of perfect formation would be very difficult for a military jet. Also, some sort of roll movement is required to change heading that quickly. Very strange.<n>

They appeared to be jade green in color and shaped as if you took four cushions and put them together,  with a hole in the middle. The ones I saw upclose appeared to be catching up to the loose group up ahead. They were undulating in a manner similar to that of a flying carpet or wave like motion. The driver saw at least 3 one upclose that appeared to him to be a black one  shaped like a flat 4 leaf clover with out the stem, and one slightly further away and  was what looked like a purple triangle. All undulating and deffinately unidentifiable!<n>

I kept expecting to see a small plane come into view over the trees any minute as the sound was getting closer and closer. To my suprise, a plane with two sets of wings came into view. It had a long slender body that appeared to attach to the large set of triangle shaped wings that made up the back end of the aircraft. These wings which actually looked like one big assembley were cut off straight on the outermost angle and were straight across the back end. I could see that they were thick at the back end .They appeared to me to be at least 2to3 feet thick with what looked like two engines in the very center of the rear of the wing assembley. These engines were not mounted on the wing assembly but a part of it. I never saw an intake. The short stubby wings were a short distance from the front end of the fuselage. This was a long very large aircraft. It looked almost like a flying wing with a fuselage stuck on it and a short set of wings on the other end of said fuselage. the plane was a silver color with the large wings appearing to be a darker color of silver. The engines made a whining noise not your common jet noise. They sounded like a small plane in a dive as heard from the ground. I thought that it was going to start to rain any minute, the clouds were black and hanging low.I expected to hear thunder at any moment. This plane came crusing over below the cloud cover and I saw it good for at least one minute,then the trees broke my line of sight. I tried to look this up on the web but the closet thing I could find was an artists rendering of the so called Brilliant Buzzard which wings and engines do not match what I observed. I was very impressed with what I observed. Who knows, I may see it again if they are flying in this area .<n>

Out to the west I saw what appeared to be a large bird which I assumed at first to be a soaring eagle.  I watched it glide for a few seconds before deciding it must be a guy hang gliding.  It was below the skyline of the mountains.  It was to the west of our home.  What I assumed to be a hang glider because of its shape and proximity to the mountains was earth-toned, brown, beige and white.  However, these colors seem inadequate in describing the colors I saw at first.  As I continued to watch what then appeared to be a hang glider swoop side to side dipping and circling it then began to spin and rise flopping end over end. Then, trying to make sense of what I was seeing, thought it was a large piece of debri being blown around by the wind because its movement was so irratic.  I watched as it rose higher and became smaller,about the size of a large star. It then stopped for maybe 2 seconds.  Then it traveled at a high rate of speed to the west, it stopped and traveled at a high rate of speed to the east.  Its shape had changed to round and white or silver.  I then saw 3 more what now appeared to be orb like spheres or balls the size of large stars darting back and forth in incredible directions and formation.  These objects where perfectly round and appeared to be silver metallic as they reflected or shimmered a little light.  I watched these 4 continue to interact until they were the size of pin heads and then no longer visible.  It was a perfectly calm day with beautiful blue clear skies and no wind.  I was left very excited, awed and wowed.  The total time elapsed from when I first  noticed this object was approzimately 2 minuted maybe longer.  The size of the object was aproximately 1/3 to 1/4 the size of a full moon and became smaller the higher it rose.

On my right was a hedgerow, with a plowed field after and on my left broken woods. As I looked through the hedgerow into the plowed field I saw what seemed to be a flattened white egg about the size of my Aireostar van about ten feet off the ground.It was pacing me in an undulating motion and slowly traveling as well as forward laterally across the field toward me. As I looked at it I thought I saw Identifying marks as a small number near the rear but as it got closer I realized what I took for a number was actually black dirt mixed with water that had followed the contour of egg with the 40 mile an hour breeze as that was my speed. As it came closer it rose above the hedgerow and was on my blind corner at the right rear but I could see it if I bent my head low and looked out my side window. There was no noise only that of my van and what seemed to be rushing air.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The next thing I remember is still traveling down this mud gravel road but whatever this was had passed me and was rising over the hedgerow at the end of the field still a good quarter mile away. How did it get ahead of me without me remembering it pass me.I continued to my service call and repaired the ships radar returning home late that night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I don&#39;t know what I saw but I can still see it in my minds eye. It was heading in the direction of London airport. This was what consoled me somewhat.

My daughter called me outside to the front porch to see a large rainbow.  The time was about 5:30pm. I went back and got my digital camera and proceeded to take some pictures.  I downloaded the pictures several days later and it was then that I noticed the two objects that appeared in two of the pictures.  They were not in every photo even though all were taken at the same time and neither my daughter nor myself had noticed them in realtime.  I never knew where to report this and send in the pictures until recently.  I am sending the two pictures to the link below.  The first picture shows the two objects rather far apart.  The larger of the two is higher in the sky.  The 2nd picture shows them very close together with the smaller of the two having apparently moved near to the larger object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

Each event consisted of an elongated triangle object with dots of light at its tips. The object or objects were yellow and orange. The object(s) appeared within the left edge of the window, &#34;bobbled&#34;, and then &#34;zipped&#34; to the right in an upward angle very quickly, then disappeared with a &#34;blip&#34; quite suddenly before exiting the frame of the window. Perhaps ten seconds later, the Object(s) reappeared from the right side at an angle, hovered, then &#34;zigzagged&#34; to the left, then up and &#34;blinked&#34; out. A few seconds later a similar occurence took place. The first object caught my attention because of the angle that it extinguished in and it&#39;s multiple lights. I waited for other objects and was awarded with further sitings! Really cool!<n>
4/23/01 01:15|Burtonsville|MD|Circle|2 minutes|very low slow flying, very strange sounding craft near DC|4/28/01|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/017/S17365.html|71|ndxe200104| very low slow flying, very strange sounding craft near DC<n> <n><n> <n><n> Burtonsville is located between Baltimore and Washington DC about 3 miles west of 95. At approximately 1:15 am we noticed a very low and slow flying object approaching from the south.  It sounded very strange emitting an low electric humming sound changing in pitch.  As is approached the sound increased in intensity but was then also accompanied by a jet engine sound. Not a jet engine in flight, but a jet engine idling. As the first approached we noticed a second craft in the distance coming from the same direction.  The first craft passed almost directly overhead and was probably less then 500 feet off the ground and flying slower then 100 mph, probably slower! Slower then any aircraft i&#39;ve ever seen.  I&#39;ve lived near an airport all my life so i know what planes and helicopters look like.  This didn&#39;t fit either description.  I saw 4 or 5 whitesh yellowish lights. Some of the lights appeared to be spinning to me,  but my friend could not recall them spinning.  The lights looked like standard aircraft lights, but the position of these lights on the craft looked strange. I could not make out the shape of the craft.  Though the most noticable thing about it was the strange noise it was making and it seemed to float across the sky rather then fly. After the first craft flew overhead, a second followed about 30 to 45 seconds behind. On this craft we could only see 1 light of the same white yellowish color.  It too was flying very slow and directly overhead in the same direction.  Though i don&#39;t think it was making the same strange hum the first object was.  It sounded like a jet but was flying way too slow.  And it did not sound like a helicopter. No strange electric or magnetic effects were objerved.  My guess is its probably ours, a craft which still uses conventional jet engines while also having some anti-gravitic technology integrated in. Could this account for the jet-engine sound and the strange loud humming noise?<n>

Upon arrival a constant humming noise could be heard, almost felt coming from the vincinity of the river(Ohio River).  While walking toward the sound, a dark triangle shaped object, about 30 feet across, slowing emerged from behind a clump of trees.  A static electric feeling was in the air, causing my skin to tingle, espically my face and arms, which were exposed.  The triangle shaped object continued to raise to about a 100 feet in the air, then took off toward the west, slowly at first, then so quick, it was gone.  This was about 1 mile from the tristate airport, which reported nothing unusual.<n>

We were returning home from dinner in Bonner Springs.  It was raining antd I was looking out my window as we were driving.  I noticed a bright section of the sky to the north about 20 or 30 degrees (aprox) above horizon, towards KCI airport.  As I drove, I kept looking at the bright area thinking that it looked just like it would if the moon was behind the clouds. Then, just for a few seconds, I saw the &#34;moon&#34; peek out from behind/through the clouds.  It looked like a quarter at arms length, white with a dark spot about an eigth of its total size about two thirds up from the bottom and a bit left of center.  I had to look back to the road and when I looked again it was gone.  The glow of the clouds had also dissapeared. My friend did not see it but I asked him if the moon should be where I saw it and he said no.  Also, the next day I found out it was a New Moon, so that was probably not what it was.  I do not know what it was. I have been hearing of some sightings in this area at this time of the month, but this is the first I have seen of anything unusual.<n>

The spheres were orange and yellow in color and were well defined spherical in shape. As I sat at a stop light after buying my lunch at a local grocery store they seemed to be playing intricate game in which the smaller balls of light performed corkscrewing and spiraling manuevers of the like I have never seen. I have been to hundreds of airshows and familiar with every type of aircraft known to be in use by military and civilian air forces and company and these fit no description or executed manuevers impossible to human aircraft. As soon as I saw them I was stunned, I couldnt believe my eyes and as soon as the light turned green I floored the accelerater and took off after them. It was a straight piece of road that lead to another intersection and by the time I reached it they just slipped out of site. I pulled into the parking lot of a used car dealership and looked aroud the sky . I could not see them so I headed into work . When I mentioned it to a couple of co-workers they said I should stop snorting cocaine. The only problem with this is that I dont do drugs and I know what I saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Given that the lights changed color during the observation, we presume, therefore, that they were probably not being generated by an advertising light.

They glowed orange as if reflecting the city lights.<n>

It was about 12:20am when I looked up and saw what looked like a big star.  I watched it for about two minutes and I realized that it was moving.  Then I thought maybe it was a plane but there were no blinking lights.  I told my friend to look at it and neither of us could explain it.  It was pretty high up so we really couldn&#39;t see the exact shape.  When it passed over our car, we could see that it was a ring of about 14 small lights.  It was moving at a moderate speed and it was not a plane.  After it passed over us, we couldn&#39;t see it anymore.<n>

I was about 5 miles from the toll booth and it took about 5 minutes for the object to intersect my truck at the zenith (toll both). I paid my toll, went down about 1/2 mile and pulled off to the shoulder of the road. It was very, very low and the far left light had a single red strobe. My wife got out and we measured this object with our outstretched arms. It was very huge and covered the distance of about 5 normal sized human hands. Almost like looking at a 747 a couple of hundred feet above the tarmac at an airport. This object made no engine noise. No turbines, no prop, no nothing. To be honest, I was completely amazed at the lack of engine noise. This object was triangle-shaped. Similar to a boomarang but with well-defined sharp corners. We stood there about 2 minutes as it slowly drifted a couple more degrees southest and while still directly above us; accelerating and gaining altitude rapidly past the horizon in about 15 seconds. By the time we were able to get the camera and snap a picture it was too far away to get anything of use on the film. Needless to say, I was disappointed. The city of Louisville had its annual &#34;Thunder over Louisville&#34; that same night so this event may be related to the airshow. But I never saw any aircraft that low that didn&#39;t make an engine thrust sound or traverse 90 degrees of sky in 15 seconds. If anyone saw the same object, I wish they would post it here so as to compare notes; or confirm that it wasn&#39;t an illusion.<n>

Anyways, it was about 12 at night and my family and i were in the car (6 including me), and it was in the middle of nowhere except for a gas station and some restaurants. There were roughly 50 cars around or so, and nobody noticed or something, i noticed first that a light was just sitting there above a street light, not moving at all. we were about a football field away from it, and we were driving slower now to see it better. I am learning to get my pilot&#39;s license, so i know this isn&#39;t something ordinary. As we were driving closer to it, i opened the window and stuck my head out, and i guess they noticed me or something. because it started to move to it&#39;s side, left and right very slowly, and knowing planes... they can&#39;t do that. there were a lot of lights around it, that&#39;s all i could see, and due to how the lights were arraigned... it seemed like a street&#39;s stop sign cut in half. As we drove underneath it, i tried to see it, but when we looked back, it was gone. that lasted for about 8 mins or so. Then about 20 mins later, we came to our relative&#39;s house and just as we parked the car and got out, we saw the same thing again, but further away. I believe it was following us, it&#39;s lights were even brighter this time and it seemed to hypnotize us or something, because i would&#39;ve thought about getting the video camera, but i don&#39;t remember thinking about anything....strange, and all i saw as i was looking underneath it was a bright red light... kind of like a beacon, and it seemed like glass or something under it. because i was able to see through it, there were lights from screens on the walls and shadows that just stood there, probably looking at us, don&#39;t remember looking at them directly, weird feeling at that time. As it came up to us, it was about 100 ft in the air or so, and was very slow above us and about 100+ ft in diameter. It made NO engine sounds except for a quiet hum and just the wind blowing, most likely from the engine or exhaust that is very efficient. Then as it was getting about 50 ft from us, it was going higher in the air and again... not much sound still and just then was i able to think of the camera and took a little video... but i can&#39;t find it, it&#39;s somewhere in the house and afraid the gov&#39;t might do something to me. then it started gaining some altitude and just turned off the lights or something and it seemed to stretch, because it was so fast, and that&#39;s when i finally heard a louder sound from it, could&#39;ve been an antimatter engine, who knows? the gov&#39;t does. Also, i heard that there&#39;s an underground military base there at Moses Lake. I know, long story, but i wanted to get the details out, and i didn&#39;t revise this, so there&#39;s things that are prob. confusing. Thx SO much for ur time, and would love to see this posted so that others could read it and wanna hear response please! I would love to talk to some authority ppl about this. : ) Thx<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.  PD))<n>

It hovered over us, remarkable making no noise, and shined a spotlight in our face.  We were so scared we were in a trance.  We could not move.  It seemed like we stood there for hours, but when it left, it had only been three minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness identifies self as adult.  PD))<n>

As I got closer to my home the globe started moving very quickly across the sky.  It would move east then stop on a dime and move west, stop again and go straight up and east as if it was nothing.  I pulled in my drive way and the white light globe lowered itself but was about 3 miles away from me and it hoovered again and the white light turned red.  It stood there for a few seconds then started west and the red light began flashing really really fast like a strobe light and it just vanished.  I live outside of town with few light and I could hear dogs all over town barking soon as the light vanished all the dogs stopped barking.  Two days ago at about the same time I was watching tv when my entire house started shaking very faintly though enough that my candles in the window seal where vibrating off the window.  I am a ((deleted)) officer and have 4 years of college as ((law enforcement)) Major and am a very respected person in my community.  Its a small rural area and something of this nature is not discussed.  Soon as the light vanished I ran inside grabbed my camcorder and drove to the top of the hill where you can see for miles but the light never came back.  I&#39;ll be waiting for it tomorrow.<n>

It was a clear dark-blue night and the objects were dark gray or silver with a small red dot on the center of the nose.  There were two flying objects, spaced apart about one hundred yards. The distance between the two objects remained exactly the same, as well as the speed. Both objects made no noise whatsoever.<n>

Then the craft started moving slowly at first gaining speed toward the right and then it hovered in one spot for about 5 min. Then a small star shaped object branched off of it and started flying straight up and around as if it were in orbit with the earth but still in the atmosphere. The star shaped light disappeared and we continued to watch the other object and it started moving further and further away then it disappeared. It was not a plane nor a star and i have never seen any thing like this before.<n>

We lived by a small lake out in the country in which there were only narrow rocked roads.  We had just topped a large hill when we instantaneously spotted a large round lighted object in the middle of the road.  The object was much wider than the road, about the size of a house and was immediately recognized as something that shouldn&#39;t be there.  My mother had slammed on her brakes coming to a skidding stop.  We both we very nervous about this finding, just then more lights appeared and it seemed to start rotating.  Now stricken with fear and apprehension we were both cussing about it being a UFO and getting the beep out of there.  She slammed the car into reverse and almost crashed into the ditch. All I could do was stare with wide open eyes as I clinged onto the dash for dear life. Just as we were about to peak the hill backwards, the terrifying UFO had started to become more clear.  It was a semi truck with trailer jacknifed in the road! Dear UFO Reader in the mix of what you probably read every day I just thought you would enjoy this story. I have found that things may not always be what they appear even when they are only a about 100 yards away, let alone thousands.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

It had no flashing lights which was why it caught my attention.  It moved about as fast as you would expect a plane to fly.  I watched it for several minutes and the light dimmed and continued for several seconds and then the light was completely gone.  It was just to the north of being overhead of me and there was no cloud cover at all.  The only explanation I can think of is if maybe S.A.C. in Omaha was flying a Stealh bomber or fighter.  I would assume they have the capability to fly without lights, but it just seemed very odd.  I honestly do not know what it was<n>

The object moved from about 40 degrees high in the Northeast horizon to a trajectory arcing toward the ground southeast of our location. The object had a whitish yellow tail and moved across the sky for approximately 7 to 10 seconds before it appeared to break apart and &#34;fizzle out&#34; just as it approached the horizon.   From my perspective the fireball was approximately the same luminosity, coloration, and size in the sky as one of the new green LED traffic lights as seen from about a block to two blocks away.<n>

It was low on the horizon, and was heading in a southerly direction away from the island.  It all seemed very normal, until it accelerated, veered upward in a gentle arc, and disappeared from sight.

My wife and children had came running into the house and said&#34; dad something is in the trees over there&#34;. My friend had a pair of strong binoculars and as I looked through them I was suddenly reminded of car lights and christmas lights strung together. I had observed the lights coming closer to us, and leaving the trees. I knew that a car could not be in the area described as it was heavily forested with trees and a car could not maneuver in this enclosed space. we watched as it flashed red blue then yellow. We all became excited and my children said &#34;dad let&#39;s go&#34; We have numerous sightings in this isolated part of montana. Some nights we see so many that the whole town just says &#34;oh yeah&#34; &#34; I see them, &#34; Now what&#34; lol. One of the times we had seen a ufo I also got to see a AWAC (along with four jets). It also had sucked energy from a power plant about 20 miles from our town. (My brother_in _law(who worked at the coal-powered plant) had said they had to keep readjusting the power to keep up with the ebb and flow of the demand. We had all seen the craft and wondered why the jets could not see where it ended up.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We would welcome other reports from witnesses, who may have observed this alleged event.

I saw a tiny pinpoint of light way up in the sky which I first thought was a star but then I noticed it was heading northward very slowly so I thought it was a satillite.  I took off the clips and it was white with what looked like a corona.  It was very far up and/or very small.  I looked around and no one was looking up so I followed it about 20 degrees across the sky.  I looked around again and when I found it again there was two.  At that point I wanted someone to confirm it and  I got up to go get somebody to look and I couldn&#39;t find it again as the further north it went, it got into a whiter part of the hazy/sunset horizon.<n>

I was able to follw them for approx. 30 seconds. The points of light were similar in brightness to satellites and moved from the north to the south.  I had a CCD camera attached to the main instrument and I snapped a 2 second exposure which shows streaking objects moving against a background of still stars. The pattern did not appear to be a solid object since the area between the moving stars showed background starts.  The appearance was that of 3 satellites flying in formation. The points of light left no trails and the light appeared to be reflective and not emitted.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We have received other reports of these lights.

There many vehicles in my immediate vicinity but I cannot account for any other witnesses. A report of the same nature would confirm. I first dismissed the object a ballon as it was seemingly rising at a moderate rate. When I looked once again at the object I noticed that it had stopped rising and was stationary. The traffic had stopped and I directed my full attention to what I was observing and noticed that although that it was stationary it was spinning. I couldn&#39;t determine the color of the object as the sun was casting a orange/red color upon it. There was however something that casted a dark shadow or a black section on the object that alternated that gave me the impression that it was spinnig. It began to rise again at a faster rate and reluctantly I had to move forward in the traffic which put the object out of my line of sight.<n>

I was in an airplane above LAX, and we were flying above the clouds. The sun was shining brightly. I looked out the window and saw a lime green sphere in the sky. It resembled a tennis ball. I could not estimate the size of it; it was hard to tell if it was near or far. It passed the plane on the left side. The object was either hovering in one spot as the plane was passing it or it was moving past the plane in the opposite direction. I watched it pass from the front of the plane to the back.

Three faint points of white light were moving across the sky in a triangle formation. They kept this excact formation the whole time i watched. Was only just visible to the naked eye, way up high, i&#39;m talking Earth orbit heights here. I&#39;m just wondering, i know the international space station is up there, maybe that is what i saw, because i didn&#39;t realise that satellites travelled in formation, grouped together like that. Not a dramatic sighting but something i felt warranted a report When first observed, i thought it was just one ordinary satellite, but then i noticed the other two close by as well, not a tight formation, the three points were spaced apart, but definatly a triangle formation, no deviation of paths, a straight line trajectory from south-west to north-east, until i could not longer see it<n>

They just came out of nowhere and just floated in the sky for a minuite or so.  At first they were of a saucer shape.  After about every 5 seconds they each changed their form in shape size and quanity.  What was espesially different about them is that their was a pattern to their changing quanity, some what of a fibbinocii sequence.  Their was one saucer shaped one and then their was 3 and they were all egg shaped.  The sequence kept going like this for 2 minuits approx.  The shapes consisted of mainley round objects.  Most of all them I cannot describe.  IT happened at 11 o&#39;clock at night on April 16 2001.  Thats pretty much it.<n>

It was a mostly sunny day with a few clouds scattered throughout the sky.  At the listed time I looked out the left side through my driver&#39;s door window.  At this point I saw what apeared to be a deep blue or black line running from the horizon to somewhere in the sky above the my car.  This line was about the width of a full moon.  It appeared to run from the west horizon to the top of the sky, wich was out of my view.  I thought it was something on my glass so I moved forward and backward to see if it moved.  I then rolled my window down to confirm that it wasn&#39;t on my window.  I also noticed that this line was above the clouds that were in the sky. It looked like someone had taken an pencil eraser and &#34;erased&#34; the light blue part of the sky where the line was.  Where the line was looked dark, like I wasn&#39;t looking through the atmosphere, but straight into space.  The edges of this &#34;black line&#34; weren&#39;t crisp.  They faded to the light blue that was on both sides of the line. After about a minute the line slowly faded away and the sky turned to its normal color in that area.  I have never seen anything like this and have no idea what it was.<n>

Both objects were perfectly round and traveling paraelle with each other. I have been a sky watcher for thirty years and can honestly say that I have never seen anything out of the ordinary. This day was an exception. The objects moved at the same speed, but the one on the outside was moving infront of and then inback of the other.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There where two women crossin the same street as I, but when I called out to them to look at the objects, they did not hear me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I must also mention that both objects where traveling nnw to a easterly direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The objects seem to be at approximatly 3,500 ft. and moving at apx. 500 mph. and curved into an easterly direction and were gone in a matter of ten seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The story does not end there! Later that day I went onto my roof with my binoculars to check out the birds in the area and also to look at the aircraft that pass over my house, being that the LaGuardia flight way passes over my building and the airport is just a five minute flight to the airport. As I trained my binoculars onto the sky, I once again had the same two objects come into view of my binoculars. It was only a second or two, but I was able to get a good look at the two objects. This time they were also coming from the nne and heading west. They were the exact same objects, but this time moving faster and both equally at the same speed.

Seen from an adjecent non-connected road. Then the Disk Vanished.<n> <n><n> <n><n> While headed for the University, I was driving with my Grandmother when I noticed what appeared to be a car in the ditch of Highway 840. The color was a sort of brownish blue Maybe a teal purple or brown also, and I could see only what I thought was the roof of the car and I saw the sun shining off it. As we rounded the road that ran along side 840, I wanted to see if it was a state troopers car. As our car got closer to the object, I noticed that it was not a car. It was a perfect Disk. About 2-3 feet round. It was doing nothing at all. As I watched, I thought it began moving along the ground. But before I could get some sense of its direction. It vanished. There was no noise, no flash of light. It just vanished. I asked my Grandmother if she had seen the disk and she said no . I then thought maybe I did not see what I had seen, but then I remembered that I had thought at first it was a car in the ditch. There was moderate traffic on 840 highway. But at the angle the object was laying it would had been hard to see it from that road. Only from my road could you see it. Our car was the only one on the road we were on. After it &#34;Vanished&#34; I looked again to see if there was a car there and there was nothing there at all. I did not go over to the express way to see if it left anything behind. I am unnerved by this. I am having a hard time believing that I actually saw it. The only thing I know is at first I thought it was a car in the ditch. THE OBJECT: It was about 2-3 feet in diameter or long. It was about a foot high. and It was a perfect disk. There was no sign of life in the short 2-3 minutes the event took place in. The person who is reporting this (ME) Is very un-nerved. I truely want to believe it did not exist but I saw it. There was no time lost. and I arrived on time to the University.<n>

I lived in an apartment building&#39;s top floor (6th) with my wife and 5 year old daughter at the time. Our daughter slept in a bed that was in our bedroom.<n> <n><n> <n><n> One night (during late hours) I was awakened because I heard my daughter crying, I sat up on my bed and to my surprise I saw a short being with gray skin and large eyes that fit the description of the beings that people report as alien beings.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There were two more at each side of my bed as well (total of three). Being that I am also a martial arts expert it was clear that these small beings were no match, at least physically to me. It all happened in milliseconds...<n> <n><n> <n><n> I saw my daughter sitting on her bed as well and in the middle of the commotion my wife would not wake up.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I felt numbing vibrations aimed at the lower portion of the back of my head. I had the sensation that the sensation was some form of attempt to restrain me. I did not like the scene at all, I was fully awake and not unders what is known as sleep paralysis.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I decided to instantly repell the intruders to protect my family as a triggered instinct. It was clear they could not understand or prevent my initial attack but before even touching the closest one to my bed I was incapacitated by a sharp energy shock. It was aimed to my back and delivered instantly to my spinal cord approximately below my shoulder plate bones.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was immobilized falling back into my own bed as I could still hear my daughter cry. These beings surrounded me and were curious as to how I was able to resist their first attempt to shut my motor functions down.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was scared and unable to move. What was more, listening to my daughter cry in fear was the worst experience in my life yet.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Everything faded and I have a partial recolelction of being inside a large oval metallic craft with other people in there as well. They appeared to be awake and yet out of it, simply sitting and waiting for &#39;nothing&#39;.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I tried to communicate with the &#39;crew members&#39; and with my peers but I do not remember anything after that.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I woke up the next day on my bed, I was fully aware of what had transpired and my child kept asking me who were the little men in the room last night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> She drew their pictures, my wife and I told her it was just a dream to minimize her fear but I know all too well what really happened.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Who do you call in these matters?

I thought that it was a satellite, rocket booster, or other misc. space junk crossing the sky, and continued to watch it as I have done in the past (I enjoy looking at the night sky and have 2 astronomy telescopes for viewing objects.) This is the strange part, the item made an instant course change and now headed due north (all directions are from my point of view). It then stopped at approx. were Auriga was. Let me say this also, everytime the item stopped moving, it would appear to be white, then before moving would start pulsing red, while moving it would remain red. All movements appeared to have instant top speed to instant stop, except for a few times were it would start at what I would estimate half speed. It then moved east and stopped to my north easterly position (around approx. the middle of draco.) Then stopped and went south, then it stopped again to my east south east position (between Bootes and Virgo.) Then it went westward, and stopped to my south (just below Leo) then make a few zig zag moves westward stopping between each movement and ending this near cancer. It then went north again, this Northward, Eastward, Southward, Westward movement, continued for at least 80 minutes (although it was now throwing in some go one direction and then go back  halfway). I watched this item also do an extremely fast and extremely tight circle (approx. the size of my fingernail at arms length) in the sky at which time it left like what appeared to be a fast evaporating contrail, (only the circle shape had the contrail). I continued to what until approx. 2350 hours. At which time I lost it over the horizon to the East.<n>

However, I do remember the time of night because I was on my way home from work (I worked at a restaurant and always got off at the same time every night).<n> <n><n> <n><n> I turned left on Vollmer Rd from Shoup, and saw what appeared to me to be a plane crossing from East to West above Swan Hill.  No big deal; I see low flying planes all the time.  The area is close to 3 different airports (1 USAF).  I kept watching it as I got closer to the object, and it looked to me (from that distance) like it had turned, because it was no longer moving across the sky.  The closer I got the stranger it looked to me.  Finally, as I was driving up Swan hill, I knew it wasn&#39;t a plane or helicopter.  I slowed my car down to about 30 MPH (I remember glancing at the speedometer; limit is 45), and I turned off the stereo.  The object could not have been more than 100 feet off of the ground, and probably about 100 feet off to my left side, just sitting there above the trees on top of the hill.  At this point I could see at least the lights clearly, though I do not remember seeing any outline around the lights.  There were three white lights, in the shape of an iscoceles triangle, and it was pointed to the South.  30 MPH is pretty slow, and I&#39;m fairly certain that it wasn&#39;t moving at all.  I do not remember hearing any noises, even with the stereo turned off.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was quite young at the time (I&#39;m only 22 now), so I didn&#39;t even know where I could try to report something like that.  I&#39;m only reporting it now because I came across this website while searching on google trying to find a list of rankings for various cities for reported UFO sightings.  I&#39;m writing a fiction novel, and the information would be useful.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Anyway, I see a checkbox for this below, but I don&#39;t &#34;want&#34; someone to contact me about this.  If anyone wants to email me that&#39;s fine; I don&#39;t really care one way or the other.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

Saw a multi-light figure in Northern sky. Lights seems to change colors end to end, with white lights in the center. Object bobbed horrizontily and vertically, more prominately horrizontily. Was generally stationary but would move a few degrees left or right. Called for wife and daughter. Daughter ran back in scared,(16 year old). Soon noticed a second object, same as the first maybe 30 degrees East of first. First object moved quickly East, then settled back to stationary. Scanned more and saw two more, much more distant and in upper sky than first two. One of them moved towards the other, then settled into stationary. They then would fade, then come back later to near the same position. Got neighbors across the street, one is a deputy sheriff and observed from their yard. Discovered two more, one on horrizon, one in directly overhead position. Overhead object looked massive, lights were constant white, but it bobbed like the rest. Western most object disappeared, but came back a short time later. An aircraft passed the overhead object, only a blind pilot would not have seen this. Sparse, very thin clouds moved in, objects were far above clouds. Was able to tell that the objects were massive in size, especially the directly overhead one by the clouds and stars. Could clearly see the movements by putting an object in line with a roofline or tree limb. All of the objects were to the North and West of me with the exception of the more overhead object. This is in the direction of the Shreveport metro area. I viewed for 3 hours and finally went to bed. I made repeated attempts to call ufo hotlines with no success. I wanted to call the sheriff&#39;s dept. but my wife protested. I did have a deputy as a witness, so just as well. I tried to film, but my camcorder wouldn&#39;t pick the light up. I will look again tonight. I have lived here for 20 years and have seen nothing like this in my life. My with kept saying weather balloons, etc. I told her repeatedly that weather balloons don&#39;t bob and weave and have multi colored lights. Incredible experience, glad several of us witnessed the event.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We have invited the witness to check the night sky on subsequent clear nights.

We both saw a VERY large object, as big as the moon, almost walnut-like in appearance because it looked very crumpled and mangled, falling through the sky about a mile away from out house. It was radiating a red and orange and yellow glow around it, like fire and flames I figured, because it left a long trail of dark grey smoke behind it. Me and my mom just watched it for a minute or two thinking &#34;Holy ((deleted))&#34; to ourselves, and it just kind of silently faded out of view. There wern&#39;t that many clouds out, so it didnt just disappear behind clouds...it just faded from view. It wasnt falling AWAY from us either, just almost straight across the sky, traveling down at MAYBE a 10 degree angle. Afterwards, we drove down to the area where we thought it mightve been (no forests or fields or anything, all suburbs) but we didnt find a thing, and I called a few of my friends the next morning, but none of them had seen a thing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

Looked up and saw 6 to 7 triangular white objects (no lights, no noise) moving south over property.  Objects appeared to be 6-12 ft wide and maybe 6 ft long.  It took about a minute for them to travel about 800 ft and out of sight behind a coulee (hill) on the property.  I was too scared to run into house and get a camera.  Property is isolated, on the lake, about 3 miles north of soap lake.  I was a Quality Manager at an electronics company in Moses Lake and did a saturday night oldies show on FM radio in Grand Coulee.  Several weeks later, a friend of mine (a court reporter) were outside the courthouse having a cigarette and I asked him if he had ever seen a UFO.  He said &#34;about a week ago, he couldn&#39;t sleep, went to his back porch for a cigarette about 2 am and saw several white, triangular objects in the sky&#34;.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date is approximate.

Well, i was looking up at the stars wondering how those people felt when I saw a flash of light come from behind me (North). I got scared because i thought it was lightning, and I turned around to see for sure. There were no clouds or anything, so i turned around. Maybe 30 seconds later it happened again and this time I felt a gust of wind also from the North. I looked up towards the sky and saw a bright shiney object moving very slightly in the sky. It was almost diamond/tear shaped and definitely not a planet, star or satellite. Im in an astronomy class and I know the difference between the 3 objects. So, I was a little scared and curious. I stood up (I forgot to mention I was on my roof) and waved at it, and then it disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  If this event, in fact, occurred, we question whether it had anything to do with the sinking of the Titanic.

There is a Military Air base at the Schenectady county airport. The C-130&#39;s routinely do check flights, touch and go&#39;s etc.  An oncoming C-130 flying low with the headlights on and landing gear lights up can look real wierd...almost like its &#34;hovering&#34;.. especially when you are in a moving car. I have seen these from my house, (right off Route 50) for years.... they are a very quiet airplane when they want to be as well, so the lack of noise is by design.  On a foggy night all you see is the bright headlight and landing gear compartment lights....very unusual looking.  We are also host to most every Blimp in the Northeast as there is ample space to post a docking mast.  Not unusual to see the Goodyear blimp as well as many other corporate blimps doing a stop-over.  One of those blimps at a low altitude and the message board lit up with an animation will turn your head too.  Just thought you might like to know the area a little. I think there IS something out there..  Dont get me wrong....

It was traveling at a very even, smooth, speed, not fast, cruising, then my boyfriend said &#34; look, there&#39;s two more!&#34; and pointed in the opposite direction, as I turned and looked, I saw two more, same as above, traveling next to each other but in a semi-circular path, the one on the right a little in front of the one on the left, it seemed to be following it.  The single one was headed southeast, and the two were headed northwest.  We were facing south over the Atlantic Ocean one block from the beach.

But as I watched, it didn&#39;t fade like most shooting stars.  As I focused on it, I saw a cluster of four &#34;lights&#34; and a cluster of three, both in a &#34;V&#34; formation, moving swiftly across the sky, east to west, not fading.  I thought, as they approached the rooftop of my house, that they seemed to merged closer together, but the light from them never dimmed.  There was no sound.  While watching, I immediately stood up so that I could see them longer and said to my  husband, &#34;What is that?&#34; He stood at the same time and said the same thing.  Then they were blocked by the house.  It passed through the upside question mark of the constellation ((personal data deleted))<n>

We; myself and 3 or 4 other surfers heard an aircraft overhead and we spotted at about 750 to 1,000 ft. a triangular craft pure black no markings and very thin approximately 3 ft. thick. It was silent.  What we heard was above it a twin engine civilian craft that looked as though it was &#34;checking out&#34; the triangle.  The triangle was the shape of a hang-glider but rigid wings and had two small approx 2ft. propellers at the trailing edge of the triangle about 2-3 feet from each of the two points at the rear.  As the triangle was only going about 40 mph the twin engine overtook it quickly and as the triangle went inland over the land without a change in altitude the twin engine that was about 750 ft. above the triangle banked off.  The triangle kept going inland. It went right over our heads and was flying level and was not gliding.  It was under power as proven by its level and slow flight for a long time.  It was not an equalateral triangle but had a trailing edge that was smaller than the leading edges.  It looked unmanned as it was very thin and if a man had been lying down inside of it it would have been very cramped as the total thickness looked to me about 2 feet.  I mentioned the sighting to the other surfers out there with me and I said what the heck was that? One replied a &#34;stealth&#34; obviously referring to the stealth bomber or the stealth fighter of which I have seen both in flight doing a couple of fly bys at a Stockton, CA airshow a few years ago.  This was way smaller than the stealth bomber and fighter and was very small.  I spoke to a family relative who worked at Lockheed Missiles and space in LA at the skunk works for several years and he said that the drones they were working on had wooden propellers 2 ft. long made by a local civilian.  The question is why would the military fly a craft over civilians in mid-day at such a low altitude and go over su! rfers a known surfing spot and then go over land?  There was no attempt to hide it. I reported it to the FAA at the Monterey airport and the air traffic controller said to me that if I spotted it again to please let him know.  Since I am 50 years old and have never seen anything even close to this before I mentioned to him that it was highly unlikely that I would ever see it again.<n>

In the early morning of April 13th, around 4:00 AM, on the from Paradise Beach on the Greek Island of Mykonos, two of my friends and I saw a strange orange light in the sky. My friends saw it exclaiming that they saw a shooting star. I looked up quickly expecting it already to be gone but it wasnt. It moved near the speed of a shooting star across the sky, which was very large given our location, above us. Then, about halfway across the sky it did something absolutely bizarre, it began zigzagging to the left and right at sharp, but seemingly identical, angles at the same high speeds as it crossed the sky. The whole thing might have taken eight seconds, but this thing definitely made about 10 radically sharp zig and zags before it vanished. I know of planes that could have crossed a sky that size in even less time, however, I know of know plane that can or would move like this. It had an orangish-yellow glow. Any legitimate suggestions would be appreciated.<n>

As he was elevating towards the sky, I did not notice anything in the sky other than my dog. I was obviously very upset and freaked out that my dog has just floated into the air, actually,he scared me. As I was rushing awayy from the scene, Three giant triangular shaped very flat looking objects with three very large roaming white spotlights appeared out of the sky, almost out of nowhere, with absolutely no noise. All of a sudden all of the lights on all three of the objects concentrated on one area of the ground, and a very large hissing noise came from out of the craft. At this point I started to run back towards my house and wasn&#39;t looking back. As I turned a corner to get out of that area, I noticed an orangy glow coming from an area in the trees, there directly in that glow were several people, humans standing looking like they were on some type of anestesia or something,(these people did not look familiar to me) Then suddenly, a very skinny silvery shiny, person started moving around these people with a bluish metallic wand and was passing it over each person like a metal detector, once he finished, the orangr glow, the people, and he being, floated towards the crafts.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We will request corroborating reports from the other witnesses, who reportedly were under the effectof the &#34;bluish metallic wand.&#34;   PD))<n>

It was a fireball that left a tail, perhaps only as an after image.

It&#39;s not unusual for me to wake up between 3 and 4 in the morning, but I don&#39;t usually pull the blinds aside to look out the window. For a few seconds,  I kept looking looking to see if there would be more, but there wasn&#39;t, so I lay back down and looked at the clock; it was 3:33 a.m. It was impossible to see where it went down, if it did, because of the treeline across the street in a very rural area. Behind the treeline there is a small lake, Spectacle Lake, and behind the lake there is a very large ridge called Mission Hill. Fireball sightings are common here. It is said they are looking out for us. Also, it is common for women to wake up between 3 and 4 in the morning.

I went to the window and they flashed but flashed longer than a plane. It was HUGE, on elight on each side. They flashed simultaneously and flashed many colours like orange, green, blue, red and pink. I don&#39;t know how to describe that it wasn&#39;t a plane but let me assure you IT WASN&#39;T. It moved at a fair speed though a bit slower than a plane i should think.

The sky was partly cloudy that night and it seemed a bit hazy. I was awakened by soft booms and went to the window to investigate.  I saw flashes of light on the horizon, as i didnt have a real good view, but they were all coming from the southeast, perhaps towards the Andrews Air Force Base area.  These flashes were not in the sky, but on or under my field of view, as there was a stadium in the way.  I think the booms corresponded to the flashes being made, but as i could not determine what they were, i went back to sleep.  I however couldnt sleep, as the booms still took place every few minutes (perhaps i heard 15-25 in all), and later i got up to the window again, the booms and the flashes were still there but a bright green cloud/haze was in the southeast direction. I&#39;m pretty sure there still could be a rational explanation to what i saw, but i could never figure it out.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of sighting is approximate.

There had been pretty high winds throughout the day and it would not have suprised me as we were on the 10th floor of the Rio Tower. Our room looked out over the back of Ceasars, and the Marage. Anyway,  I told my wife to look at it and she said it looks like a parachute coming down.  I jumped up to my feet and told my wife to hand me my glasses.  It appeared to be a parachute coming down with a wobble. I was unable to tell the size,  but it seemed to be about 2000 ft or so high.  Again,  I couldn&#39;t get a good idea of the size.  The closer it got the more it looked like it was the top of a mushroom or a jellyfish, without tenacles.  I then thought maybe a weather baloon.  I have an A&amp;P linense and have been in the Aviation industry since I was 18 in the U.S.A.F. and have worked on the flight line day and nighttime hours for the rest of my life working as a line mechanic. I don&#39;t feel that I get fooled easily by objects in the sky.  I have never seen anything that I thought couldn&#39;t be explained away before.  Now for what was unbelievable to me.  The object then stop decending and started to rise.  It continued to rise until it looked like a small star, it was very bright as it moved higher, then made a left turn and went a small ways to the left and then, get this! It completely reversed and started back the way it came. There were some clouds about, but my view was to a clear blue sky.  They object then began to climb at an angle and met with another object about the same size that came down from above it. They move together up and to the right until they disappeared from view. In the next few minutes, as I continued to watch the same area of the sky, I shaw three more decend,  but not nearly as close to the earth. They too started to climb  and change directions as they move out of my sight.  There were some large planes with contrail flying over,  but these objects had no contrail. ! Being i n the hotel room,  I was not able to here any sound. I am now 55 years old and I am glad that I have finally seen what I believe to be a sighting of a craft that was not from this Earth.  If it was from here, we really have some great stuff that we&#39;re not telling anyone about.  I think this pretty well covers what I swear I saw.<n>

As soon as it saw us, it dipped under and we didn&#39;t see it again. My friend did not see this entire thing, but he can confirm that there was something there. He was busy staring at the light in the sky. It was moving, in sort of what seemed like circles, very fast. It first looked like a spotlight coming up from the ground, but it could because the clouds were low and you would be able to see the beam. I thought it could be a helicopter, shining its light from above the clouds. But that would work because there&#39;s absolutly nothing like that around here. The object disappeared then came back after about thirty seconds, then disappeared again.

I would like to note that we do not discuss UFO topics with her, and therefore I seriously doubt that she would have dreamed this up on her own, infact I was struck by the amount of information and details that she related to me. We are guessing the time to be around 10:00 PM; she had been lying in her bed looking out the window when she saw a bright ball of fire streaking across the sky.  She said the round object was very bright with orange and red colored flames or sparks coming off the back of it, and moving very fast, faster than an airplane, and made no sound.

(http://www.((URL deleted)).com) They appeared from an estimated aerial distance of not more than 3 kilometers across my bedroom window. From a distance, it could be ignored and thought of as the sunlight bouncing-off from a huge mirror.

The degree of physiological damage it left me is very minor though - like swollen gums and slight fatigue. I shall feature more pictures  in the coming days.

Il bello era che quando cercavamo di avvicinarci ancor di piu&#39; per osservarlo, l&#39;oggetto sembrava allontanarsi di proposito, come se avesse paura di noi.Fu chiaro che, quella luce bellissima, ci teneva d&#39;occhio, ma non si preoccupava piu&#39; di tanto, neanche quando accesi l&#39;accendino, oscillando la fiamma per far qualche forma di comunicazione.Non successe nulla.Dopo circa un oretta, decidemmo di andarcene ognuno a casa nostra, lasciando la luce dove l&#39;avevamo vista.<n>

After observing the aircraft for about 15 seconds I saw two small round dull red lights, many hundreds of yards apart, appeared over the airplane at 45 degrees above the horizon. The two red lights moved perfectly in unison, first moving away from each other, then almost converging and finally travelling at their original spacing before disappearing near tree top level to the West. The two red lights had a unique deep dull red hue which did not change in color or intensity. The lights movements through the sky approximated the shape of an hour glass. No noise was heard from the lights. The two red lights were visible for 10 seconds. After the red lights disappeared the landing lights from the plane (helicopter?) switched off and the aircraft disappeared into the evening sky.<n>

I was fishing on Dixie lake in missouri, on the bank.  Hardly any wind, patchy low clouds.  Plenty of blue sky between clouds.  I believe I was facing mostly east.  I heard something to my north,  it sounded like something cutting through the air.  I never saw anything, it sounded like it passed almost directly overhead.  Nothing but the sound of something gliding through the sky.  Sounded like an airplane with the motor turned off.  I just wondered if anybody has ever heard this.<n>

That area of the house is at the South East corner with a small window of frostd glass facing South. I was half asleep and after using the faciltity had just leaned over to flush the toilet. Out of nowhere my eyes were filled with an intense bright white light. It was &#34;intensly&#34; bright. Brighter than a welders torch. I heard no noise but am not sure about that since the flush of the toilet was making noise. I went from a state of half asleep to WIDE AWAKE in about one second! I remember being so freaked by the intensity of the light that I said out loud &#34;What((deleted)) is that?&#34; I went to my dresser to get my glasses and went to other windows to see if something was outsde. I did not see anything and after getting up the nerve to open up the side door to the deck all I saw was the full moon above to the Southwest. It was somewhat covered by clouds coming out of the Southwest. It could not have been a trick of light from the full moon because the white light was way to bright for that. As I walked around the house looking out of windows for a couple of minutes I noticed that the time on the clock in the microwave just inticated that it was 2:30 A.M. The light seemed to be decending from above more than simply passing by. Perhaps it was only the remnants of a meteorite falling very close to the house.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Anonymous report.  PD))<n>

The singular craft landed in a nearby field for a few seconds. It wasn&#39;t until I noticed that the dog had stopped barking that they had abducted him. We ran into the caravan (trailer) and we were all very frightened. Then the radio and TV all switched on and off in a rythmic fashion as if it was a message.<n>

I saw what appeared to be a meteorite because it made a pronounced streak as it entered the atmosphere.  A moment later, a very small object appeared in my sight.  At the same time this object came into view I heard a sound from it.  The sound was of a very high frequency--a very high pitch unlike I had ever heard before.  But the sound was only heard when it first appeared and then ceased to make any sound.  The object then moved from the east to the west quite swiftly.  It moved in a zig-zag like fashion across the sky directly overhead to the western horizon and then disappeared.  To view the object required strict attention on part of the observer.<n>

They looked blueish. the weather was cloudy and I could not see very clearly the shape, but it looked round. They looked not very high above ground. The reason I think they were UFO is because the way they changed flying direction. They could suddenly reverse their direction and the acceleration was just not possible for any know man-made machine. They looked like playing each other. UFOs lasted about two minutes. When I went inside to get a camrecorder and to record them, they were gone. however, as a scientist majored in Physics, I must admit those UFOs I saw could be lighting. But I never saw any lighting like that. So I thought it may be a good idea to share my experience with some experts. Hopefully, I am not the only that reported this in NJ. I don&#39;t wish to be contacted my phone or mail. But I can be reached by email, in case you have further questions.<n>

Half the length of a finger at arms length.  Looked at first like a plane, but it was too low, too big, and had NO tail or visable wings.  Sighted at first as I stopped at the circle, it seemed to be hovering, not moving like a plane.  Lost sight of it as I went around the circle and continued on Fairmount.  Glimpsed it again about 1/3 of a mile later, through a break in the treeline.  Saw it for about 4 second at that point, and it had turned paralell to my direction. It looked larger and was still moving slow or hovering.  The right end of it had a large light or reflection upon it at this point, yellow white in color.  The body had indistinct markings or shapes, and it was rounded at both ends.  No sound was heard, there was no vapor trail, no smoke.  It looked like it was within a mile of my location.<n>

I watched for maybe 2more min. when another one showed up almost where the frist one appered. I went into the house and got the others who were playing cards to come look and conferm I wasent going nutty. they saw it to and watched with me as the lights moved up and down and back and forth then vanish, sometimes changing color from bluegreen to a super bright orange before they would vanished. shortly after we saw the last one air traffic in the area (jets) was considablely more than at any time Ican remember.<n>

We saw orange lights below the cloud cover in the northern sky. they would change in size and brilliance, wink out and once on blinked out then flashed once very brightly. they usually appeard to be stopped, but after they would blink out, a minute or so later they would show up in a different location. First the apparent movement was to the west, but a few minutes later when the lights reappeared they stayed on and moved to the east. We also noticed several blinking white pinpoints of light in the general area of the larger orange lights. These appeared as twinkling stars, except that they did not appear to be stationary, actually they were more random in their position. The Orange lights at their largest might have been about half the diameter of a dime held out at arms length. I estimate our distance from the objects to be about 1.5 - 2 miles. we watched from our car out on some country roads. We saw them from two close locations (about 50 yards appart), and got out of the car and watched them both times. Later we move to a location that I thought would be closer but we did not see them again. I have seen the same things before with my daughter in the same general area arount last Thanksgiving. I know several others who have seen and described the same things in the same general location.<n>

What I saw first was a very large bright oval shape light coming twords me from the S.E.At first, I thought it might be a airplane but the light was much brighter than any airplane I had ever seen before.So,I called for my son to come and join me outside as I thought he might know what type of aircraft it was.By the time he arived outside the object/craft was over our heads.Neither he nor I had any idea as to what type of aircraft it was.We live close to an airport , we hear and see many airplanes and jets but we have never seen anything like this before.The object was very large,prehaps two or three full moons in size. There was a large ,bright oval shape light on what appeared to be the frount of the object and several other lights forming what appeared to be a triangular shape craft. In the center of the object was a red light, none of the lights flashed.As I stated the object was very large but made little sound. However, the sound it did make was that of a soft humming.It wasnt untill the object was overhead that I/we heard a sound .It seemed to be grey or black in color,moving rather slowly for we were able to view it for about three min.It appeared to have a haze around it, prehaps due to the brightness of the frount light. It flew over our heads heading in a N.W. direction.We would very much like to know what it was we saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We have spoken with the two witnesses on several occasions now, and they seem to be very good observers, and they seem quite insistent that what they witnessed on this night was not an aircraft.

They were slowly moving South to North. I watched for about 4 minutes, they didn&#39;t chage directions, but stayed in a formation. No sounds were heard. Then the clouds moved in, and I could only see them in the breaks of the clouds for about 2 minutes. Then the clouds took over completely. It was fantastic, but chilling, too.

The object kinda look like giant stars, with a slight flickering.<n>

Your show alerted us that reports were coming in concerning lights just south of the San Diego border. I walked outside not really thinking I would see anything. Boy was I wrong! About 100 or more star sized nonflashing lights were moving in a loose formation across the sky from north to south. It was totally incredible! An armada of UFOs. I got out my big fujinon 10x70 binoculars and watched them move all the way across the horizon. I could see no detail even with the fujinons. They were so high up they must each have been huge to be so bright when viewed from ground level. This was a major display that I think was more shocking than the phoenix lights. Again let me repeat, over 100 star sized solid white lights moving together in formation across the background starfield. They were not stars. You must investigate this. I never thought UFOs were real, now I have seen 100 at once!<n>

It passed almost directly over me &amp; continued in a straight westward line until the trees obscured it from view.  The light was like a motorcycle headlight - single, not double as an airplane&#39;s.  There was no accompanying jet noise or airplane motor noise - only a soft after&#34;hum&#34; - like a furnace running, or wind through trees.  This craft did not have red and green lights.  I saw 4 distinct lights arranged in a diamond shape (or a triangle with a tail).  There was also the suggestion of a few smaller lights around the back of the craft.  The front and rear lights were cream colored, while the side lights were amber and chartreuse.  It was travelling rapidly - from initial sighting to the point where I lost it in the trees took less than 30 seconds and the approximate distance I would estimate to be 3/4 mile.  The sky around my farm usually has many moving lights - all attached to regular aircraft.  The traveling speed of this craft astonished me, making me realize that it was not one of the &#34;regulars&#34;.  Background info:  I&#39;m a retired Chicago teacher (35 years) and live on a small farm with dogs, cats, 3 sheep, 1 goat, and 1 horse.  I study dressage, ballet, spinning, weaving, and read in my spare time.

She reported that the object passed over her head, covering some 160 degrees (est.) of arc, in the 30 seconds she witnessed the object.  We do not believe that the object could have been a plane, in light of that fact.  The witness reported that it was totally silent.  PD))<n>

The husband stated that he saw a light which appeared low in the woods behind the house. The wife went into the kitchen where she could get a better look but saw nothing. She then went into the living room, and opened the sliding glass door which exits to the back of the house. Within seconds of opening the doors, a large diamond shaped object appeared from over the house, and continued to move as it passed over the trees in the back woods. The object moved fast and steadily, as it passed about 150 feet overhead. The object was observed for about 8 seconds, when it suddenly seemed to vanish above the tree line. The object which was viewd from underneath, was described as a large solidly outlined diamond shaped object which made a humming sound as it passed over. At each corner, there was a dim white non-blinking light. In the bottom center of the object, was a flat red non-blinking light. Immediately after the sighting, the witness and her husband drove towards the area where the object had disappeared, but nothing was seen. The witness reported feeling nervous and could not sleep well for a couple of days after the incident. The witness also mentioned that every night for a month prior to the sighting, she had been feeding several raccoons which came from the woods. The night of the sighting was the first night which they did not appear, however they did return the next evening. I interviewed the witness the day after the sighting.

Almost directly above me there was some type of aircraft.  From almost directly underneath, it had five rounded sides, with a light at each of the five points.  It was a bit like a pentagon, but rounded enough to say that it was round - with five distinct edges.  The lights were yellowish in color and not very bright.  The craft was low to the ground compared to the air traffic that we typically see in our area. There were intermittent clouds in the area, and the craft was moving slowly.  It was moving in pretty much a straight line to the east/northeast.  There was a large cloud in it&#39;s flight path, and as it disappeared behind the cloud, I stood there to watch it come out the other side.  Given it&#39;s speed and the size of the cloud, I expected to see it come out the other side relatively quickly.  When it did not, I looked around, and saw the craft now moving in a south/southeast direction, looking like it made a 90 degree turn when it was hidden by the cloud. I could not make out the color of the craft since it was night, but the lights were yellowish and they lit the craft enough to make the five sides clearly visible. I am a professional and student in the town of Charlottesville in my late 20&#39;s.  I&#39;ve never seen anything like this before, and was not under the influence of any substances - it was a fascinating experience, and I hope I see it again sometime soon to get a better look!<n>

My window looks to the west.  Sunset had occured and I had noticed the pink clouds low on the horizon shortly before the event.  It was approx. 7:10 or 7:15 and both my cat and I saw two firey objects streak acorss the upper portion of the window (which would probably be about 70-90 degress from the horizon.  These two objects were moving from the south to north, low and it almost appeared that they were below the clould level.  They were both yellow-orange in color, and appeared to leave a trail or had a trail as the streaked acorss our line of vision.  They were moving fast in a horizontal movement, slightly rising.  They were almost parallel with each other, possibly one slighty postioned behind the first.  It was not totally dark as I could see the clouds, yet the lights from the objects was bright, nearly as bright as the reflection a few minutes later of my interior fan light on the window.  As soon as they streaked by, I said out loud to my cat, What was that!  He had definitely noticed at the same time I had.  I jumped up and ran into my living room so I could see the north exposure.  (I live close to the Red Rocks at the uptown area of Sedona).  I could see nothing in the darkening sky, except a few clouds.  I would say it looked similar to rockects being fired--and/or metorites, although I have never seen metorites of that color or at that time of the evening--nor even in that particular movement horizontally across the sky.<n>

Two of us saw it and were in complete awe. I expected there to be a jolt when it hit(if it hit ground); but, there was no jolt. One observer works in the conservation field and the other is currently a stay at home mom.

Partying with my friends at Daddy Rocks (nightclub). I went to get some fresh air up on the top floor outdoor deck. I see about 30 spectators (including 3 security doormen) lookin&#39; to the sky, claping and screaming in joy. I look up and see, what seems to be flying stars. I instantly know there not stars becuase the way they are moving. There where lots (probably around a hundred all together). I would see some moving as a group (like 5 or 6) ,but not in Unisen, all where traveling at there own speed and direction. they would fly in one direction then pause in one spot then dart off in the oppisite direction. They would fly up then down and zig zag across the sky. I seen some fly in real close to each other, pause next to each other, then dart of in different directions. There was huge lights at this club that shot up in the sky (around 8 lights formed in a circle) that would go left to right, right to left. When these lights went to the right hand side of the sky (where most of the UFO&#39;s where) the UFO&#39;s would get brighter and more active (almost like it was putting on a show for us). At one point about 8-10? UFO&#39;s joined in what seemed a sloppy circle in the sky, paused for a brief couple seconds, then they all darted off in there own direction. (kind of like a childs drawing of the sun. They took off like the lines around the circle). I seen a few that seemed like they where goin so fast towards each other like they where goin to crash, but they went right by each other (real close). After about a half hour of seeing this, I went into the club and tried gettin all my friends to come out and see what I seen, there first reaction was that I was high or drunk and was seeing things, after getting up on the deck though they relized I wasn&#39;t seeing things. They too seen what appeared to be UFO&#39;s. We starred at the sky for about another hour till we finally left (it was still going on when we left, but I noticed there were less of them and where slightly dimmer).I just wish I broug! ht my vi deo camera.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with this witness, and we found him to be seemingly sober-minded.

I was walking to meet my friend from her work when i was walking down a dark street with no street light&#39;s,i was walking down that street so i can get a clear look at the stars because oregon is usualy cloudy.Anyways i looked up to see three things,one of which was a plane going normal speed,the other two thing were way farther up in the sky moving very fast.It was interesting because the plane was very high and the other objects were way higher but moving way faster.They were both going the same direction keeping the same distance from eachother but flying side by side.I used to watch the sky when i was younger and i saw a lot of satalights,these looked like satalights but you can tell they obviouly were not because satalights do not fly side by side.They also looked like they were in the atmosphere .I watched them go all the way accross the sky untill the were out of sight.I also saw them change course and fly off into the horison. I was looking at them for at least 30 seconds. They were not a jet or anythng like that because jets dont manouver like that and they dont move that fast either.They must have been some kind of new technology.The first feeling i got was that it was some kind of secret government technology.Either that or it was E.T.<n>

Also, the second photo does appear to show two amorphous &#34;blobs,&#34; that appear to be somewhat triangular in shape.  Our computer monitor does not allow us to identify them, however.

Since the move, I&#39;ve had to make a 45min drive down I85 to get to exit 19B in Anderson S.C. to get to Tri-County Technical College in Pendleton S.C. in the morning. While driving past exit 35 on 85 I noticed an extremely bright object over the tree line. It was like a pinprick of blueish white light. Just by the objects appearance I was able to decern it was not any type of conventional aircraft. If it was a passenger jet really far away, then its lights were way too bright, If it wasn&#39;t very far away then it had no discernable shape and it hovered motionless in the air. From what I saw I think it was pretty far away though. One noticable event that happened was that the light blurred for one moment then returned to its normal brightness. When I say blurred I don&#39;t mean it looked as if it was obscurred or anything like that. It sort of fizzled. The thought immeadiatly came to my mind that it seemed almost pixilated like a distortion on a crappy computer monitor.

I was chatting with one of my co-workers, and I happened to glance to my left. A large, bright green ball of light with a green &#34;tail&#34; streaked across the sky at a very fast pace, moving downwards at a steep angle. It looked to me as though the ball would crash into the college campus located about 1/4 of a mile east up the road. I asked my co-worker if she had also seen the light, and she said that she had, but only for a few seconds. I kept waiting for the resounding crash that I was sure was coming when the &#34;craft&#34; would hit the earth, but I heard nothing. Initially, I thought it may have been a plane that was in some sort of trouble, but then, after I got on the bus, and my co-worker and I talked more about it, I realized that it might not have been just a plane. It made no noise whatsoever, and from where we were standing, it was not that far away that we wouldn&#39;t have heard the roar of the engine if it were a plane. I have just read another person&#39;s account of a similar ball of green light shooting towards the ground 2 years ago in Johnson City, NY, about 7 miles away from where I had my sighting, and that is what has really convinced me to share my experience.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness corrected date of sighting.

I used to live about 2 miles south of nellis AFB (foe about ten years) and saw large night maneuvers such as he described...with as many as thirty aircraft, and supporting aircraft such as refuelers, AWACS type aircraft, and cargo planes taking off at late evening hours and returning a short time later. Of course, some of these instances may be simply explained as one group of pilots leaving for their homes, and another group timed to arrive shortly thereafter. I have also witnessed the &#34;winking lights&#34; scenario described, though only once and it was here in the Pahrump valley, anout fifteen years ago. I saw a similar glowing ball of orangeish light, above the mountain range that sperates Pahrump valley from Death Valley area, it pulsed a total of three times that I witnessed, and in those pulses it appeared to travel some twenty or so miles northward . I saw NO chase airxraft as the other gentlrman described, and had two witnesses with me. I at first argued that it must have been a series of beacons on radio relay towers or something, but there are no towers along that range. No sound, ball was about the size of a pencil eraser on end at arms length. It would start as an amber dim glow, increasing in intensity over about five seconds, then flash out and reappear some five miles uprange. Whew! All of that said, I only have one more thought to add before I tell about my sighting. Because of the job Ihave, I have occasion to drive seventy miles at night five nights a week, and have noticed that lights can easily be seen thirty miles or so most of the time, and aircraft lights approaching MCCarran can be easily seen 50 miles away. You would never hear them, but you would see them, and a more inexperienced viewer might feel they are much closer, and therefor should make noise. Also, I have seen flares dropped by evading aircraft, and the orange lights are NOT at all the same, flares slowly fall to earth, start brightly and then dim. Now to my sighting. Its about 9 PM, I am in a hurry to get inside to watch something on TV, and as I walk westward to my door, I hear a low throb in the air. There is a small helicopter service that sometimes flys at night here, and the air-rescue helicopters from Vegas, each with their distinct sounds, and it was neither. Sometimes jets heading to MCCarran will throttle back over the Pahrump valley and the change in pitch as it bounces of the mountain ranges, and its strange, so I pause for a moment in the dark, scanning the clear night sky for any unusual movements. About thirty seconds later a pair of red flashing lights appear over the range of mountains directly to my Northwest, the foot of the range is two miles from my home, and I beleive that the lights were two of the black helicopters stationed out at Nellis, you can usually see them at the extreme North end of the airstrip if you drive LVBL North to the Speedway racetrack. Anyway, these are the two prop jobs, which fits with my recollection of the sounds from Nellis when I lived there. The two lights followed the ridge of the mountain Northwest and at one point flew below the ridgeline, obscuring them from view and masking their sound almost completely. Since the Nellis training grounds lie mainly NE of the Pahrump valley, I can only guess what they were doing flying along the NW range of PV, unless it had some thing to do with sneaking into the training area by flying low and entering from the west instead of the south or southeast, as much traffic does. Well, that is all I have to say, and I am not a debunker or anything, but I have lived near airbases since I was 8 years old. I&#39;m 40 now, and worked nights for the last six years. The report from Las Vegas seems to be a description of night manuevers, with planes chasing the Agressor aircraft, and larger planes supplying intel to the pilots, whose jobs are much more dangerous at night in a dogfight situation. The flashes could be flares, and the excersise could probably be seen if it was held in the southern end of the Nellis range and the subject lived on the side of &#34;sunrise&#34;(frenchman?) mountain, say near the intersection of Lake Mead and Hollywood, which affords an excellent view at night of Nellis AFB airstrip and views some forty miles northward. I would also guess that my helicopters were involved in a similar night action, perhaps practicing recovering a pilot downed at night. Sorry to go on so long, I just thought it would be fair to give a litlle explanation of the manuevers around Nellis AFB, since a lot of people would think military air traffic at night as strange, but at Nellis, its fairly commonplace!<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We agree with the contibutor&#39;s assessment of lights in the night sky.  They can be very difficult to identify positively.  PD))<n>

In fact it was the first night we were to stay here. Anyway, driving east I look out the passenger side window right beside me while my wife was driving and looking forward. I glanced up slightly and saw a huge bright light flying only a kilometer or so over the tree line. At first I thought it was a plane with its landing lights on but there is no airport near by. At closer investigation I saw that the brightest of the lights was in front of the craft and there were two more at the rear making a triangle shape. There was a blinking light directly at the bottom. While it was still a good distance from us I noticed a small light of some sort fall from underneath this thing.  As it came closer I thought about pointing it out to my wife. Just as I thought of telling her I heard her ask &#34;What is that?&#34; We slowed down and looked at it for several seconds as it lowered and finally became less illuminated. I could see clearly the side of the craft. It had what looked like windows wrapped around what I call the hull. Just when most of it was visible it lit up again very quickly and disappeared with a bright flash of light. No sooner than we saw this my wife started to almost scream when we saw two more directly in front of us. They all looked identical to the first one. Again I saw a light (almost looked like a meteorite) fall from the bottom of one of the other crafts. One all of a sudden appeared and went straight down in the east. We were speechless. We finally talked about it when we got to the apartment building only a mile from where we witnessed all of this. To say the least this was the weirdest thing either of us have ever experienced.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates a date of 03AP01, but subsequent investigation report suggests a date of 01AP01.

Almost instantly, it disappeared. I mean, it literally looked like it traveled at warp speed, leaving a white trail behind it momentarily. This was the first of 2 UFOs I have ever seen, so we got back to my friend&#39;s house and ran inside screaming.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.

The investigator interviewed the witnesses on 14 November, 2001 for one hour, He did not visit the site of the sighting due to lack of enthusiasm to do so by the witnesses. Each of the 2 witnesses observed different UFOs. It is possible, but not likely, that they were related, since they were several miles apart and their appearance differed radically.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Witness Description:<n> <n><n> Witness 1.  Male, age middle 30s. Occupation: works at assembly plant in Stillwater. He was strongly impressed by the sighting and talked about “nothing else” that night with witness 2, his wife. However, he was not traumatized. He has not spoken about the sighting except for a few people close to him until the interview with the investigator.  No previous or subsequent UFO sightings. Witness was in good health with good eyesight. The witness did not have any particular interest in UFOs and had not read any books on the subject before his sighting.<n> <n><n> Witness 2.  Female, age early-middle 30s, wife of Witness 1. Works in local area. Witness is apparently in good physical condition. Eyesight, hearing are good. Witness was excited about the sighting (even 6 months later) but did not describe any symptoms of trauma. No previous or subsequent UFO sightings. The witness did not have any particular interest in UFOs and had not read any books on the subject before her sighting. She has done some reading after the sighting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Sighting Account.<n> <n><n> The witnesses were driving east on Rt. 96 near the intersection with highway 5 in a rural area 1-2 miles north of  Stillwater, MN ( ~22 miles east of St. Paul.)  The landscape is gently rolling comprised of  crop fields and wooded areas. It was nearly dark, but some light remained in the sky, which was clear.<n> <n><n> Witness 1,<n> <n><n> Object description.. Sitting on the passenger side of the car the witnesses were traveling in, witness 1 noticed a lighted, triangular object to his right. The object appeared to be about 250 ft on a side. The witness reported the triangle was equalateral, though his (inexact) drawing shows it as isosceles. It was not possible to discern a texture to the surface of the object. A bright white light was at each apex of the triangle underneath the craft. The lights were not bright enough to illuminate the ground beneath the craft. There was also a red light in the center of the bottom of the triangle, less bright than the white lights, which blinked about once per second. There were no other lights on the object and no windows, orifices or other surface features were visible. The color of the object was black, but not the same color as the stealth aircraft. The object produced no sound, although the witness did not get out of the car. No other witnesses are known to have observed the object.<n> <n><n> Position, movement and duration. The nearest surface of the object was approximately at a 60 degree angle from the ground when the craft was at its lowest altitude. When first seen the object was about 400 ft above ground but moved down “quite rapidly” to about 150 ft and hovered for several seconds, then rose up to about 400 ft. There was no apparent lateral motion of the object. The car was moving about 45 mph but slowed to 10-15 mph immediately upon sighting of the object. The object was last seen to the rear of the car and disappeared when the car got too far away for the witness to see it. The duration of the sighting was about 1 minute. Witness 2, the driver, did not see the object because she was concentrating on driving.<n> <n><n> Drawing of object. When he came home the witness made drawing of the object (Fig. 1) which looked substantially the same as the drawing he made during the investigation. The original drawing was lost. After the sighting, he read some UFO literature, including accounts of the triangular objects seen in Belgium in the early 90s. as shown in Figure 1.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> 2 of 2<n> <n><n> Figure 1. Object viewed from below at its lowest altitude.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> Sighting evaluation: CE1. The object described is similar to the description of many triangular objects seen worldwide for the past 20 years. There is no conventional explanation apart from the possibility that the craft was an advanced military aircraft. However, current known technology is not consistent with a craft capable of hovering and moving rapidly vertically upward and downward without engine noise.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Witness 2<n> <n><n> Object description. Witness 2 observed two white lights, separated by the width of her thumb at arms length directly in front of her (toward the east). The lights were estimated to be 15 miles away (though she emphasized the uncertainty of this estimate), and were seen at the same time as witness 1 observed the triangular object to his right. Witness 1 also observed the two lights, but not closely, since he was occupied with observing the triangular object to his right. Witness 2 estimated the size of the lights to be about 1/8th the diameter of the moon and the brightness as brighter than a streetlight. Based on the inverse square law, this would mean the lights were more than 225 times the intrinsic brightness of a streetlight. As far as she could tell the object was not illuminating the ground. No other witnesses are known to have observed the lights.<n> <n><n> Position, movement, and duration.  Witness 2 estimated that the object was about 20 degrees above the ground. This would make the altitude of the lights about 6 miles (~31,000 ft). The lights appeared motionless for about 1 minute, then moved downward rapidly until they disappeared below the tree-lined horizon about 3 seconds after they began their descent. The calculated speed of movement was 7200 mph. The lights disappeared at about the same time as witness 1 lost sight of the triangular object. The witnesses observed airplanes in the vicinity but witness 2 was adamant that the lights she saw were not conventional aircraft. The nearest airport is 9 miles to the southwest, 135 degrees to the right of (behind) the direction where the objects were sighted. There are no airports within at least 40 miles to the east of the sighting location.<n> <n><n> Additional lights. During the time the 2 lights were hovering, they emitted 2 smaller lights which circled downward and back up and joined with the primary light a few seconds after they appeared. The witness had no estimate of the speed of these lights and said they were not quite as bright as the primary lights.<n> <n><n> Sighting Evaluation: Probably conventional aircraft. If the object size was 1/8th the apparent diameter of the moon and 15 miles away, it would have been a very large object, indeed. At 225 times the brightness of a streetlight, it would also have been exceedingly bright. The downward speed of 7200 mph is also extraordinary. The lack of other witnesses or press coverage of such a remarkable object as well as the inexperience of the witness and the well known difficulty in judging distances of lights in the sky causes the investigator to believe that the lights were probably much closer than estimated and thus much smaller and less bright. Despite the lack of an airport in the direction of the sighting, the presence of a major airport, MSP, 30 miles west of the sighting causes the investigator to believe that the lights could very possibly have been attached to aircraft. However, there is not enough information to make an unambiguous judgment.<n>

As I looked up while serving,I saw a stationary star like thing in the sky in the background of other stars, start moving. I quickly drew the attention of the other three towards the moving object. Two of them saw it but the third one didn&#39;t. The object looked exactly like star (not the star shape but like the stars we see in the night sky). It was stationary at the biginning and then it suddenly started moving. It was not a shooting star as i&#39;ve seen some my self(during the meteor shower in Nov 1998). It was not even a plane because I&#39;ve seen many myself. After about 5-10 seconds, when I had gone to switch off the flood lights (we were playing under lights as it was dark), it suddenly disapeared.<n>

WE were passing under the Avra Valley over pass looking at this object that undisputably had no familiar confirmation as being a standard lighter than air-craft.  Marana was approx. 10 miles (35 north of Tucson).  As we got closer to Marana and allowing for my directional change of roadway we were made aware that it began moving (floating if you will)liesurely to the West and between Marana and the Tucson Mts. just west of I-10. As we approached the exit off I-10 into Marana (Greir Rd) I decided to exit to get a better view. We traveled west for 4 miles and met a dead end, exited our auto and watched it speeding up considerably and entered the distant cloud cover probably some fifty plus miles away.  The skies were cloudless over it&#39;s hover-location as well as Marana.  It&#39;s itinerary as I could discern that it traveled over the pencil of Tsn Mt&#39;s as they curved away from I-10 for about five miles.I wish to add that the confirmation of configuration is a typical saucer image with the dome over a concave/convex type body, exactly what has been drawn by others as well as the caricature craft we think of as being a &#39;flying saucer&#39;.
