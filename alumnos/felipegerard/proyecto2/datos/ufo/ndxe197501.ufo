Several friends and I were sledding on the hills behind our neighborhood. It was after dark. A friend mentioned that the stars in the sky were &amp;quot;moving&amp;quot;. I looked up. And, indeed, half a dozen point sources of light were moving randomly in the Western sky. The moved up and down and side to side. At first, I thought that they must be helicopters. But there was no sound from the objects and I couldn&#39;t imagine why half a dozen helicopters would be flitting around the January sky in such a hap hazard fashion. We watched this display for a few minutes. Then, collectively, we got creep out and called it a day on the slopes. I headed in for a bowl of my Mom&#39;s home made chicken soup and tried to put the UFOs out of my mind. I have no explanation for what we saw that night.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

While walking in a northwesterly direction on Lloyd Road (see map) I saw what appeared to be an airplane with its landing lights on approaching me just above a house on Cheyney Road. I was startled because there seemed to be at least six or seven very bright white lights in a row. I had never before seen so many landing lights on a plane, there are usually only two, maybe three or four at the most. We live along one of the approaches to Philadelphia International Airport (about five miles SW of us) so I have seen many planes approaching with their lights on.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I looked at the lights for a few seconds, there was no sound of a plane, only the wind blowing. Suddenly the area around all the lights turned a bright red/orange, sort of a flattened oval shape. Where the white lights had been, the red/orange color was brighter than the rest of the object. The color was very intense and reminded me of the intense type of color that you get from a welders torch, only it was an intense red/orange and not blue.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object then began to move sideways (easterly) and at that instant it turned into a white color again, turned and moved extremely fast away from me in a north easterly direction and quickly vanished in the distance. The whole event lasted about 15 or 20 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I never told anyone of this event but after seeing a television story about the January 2000 object near East Saint Louis, it reminded me of this event because the lights in a row seemed to similar to what I had seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.

I went with her to the end of our driveway and she pointed east. At the end of the dead end street we lived on there was a line of bare trees that bordered the entire trailer park where we lived. Above these trees I saw a huge triangular black shape that seemed to be floating very still and silent. On each corner of this shape small white lights glowed dimly. As we looked at this shape , my mother kept trying to question what it was, saying things like &#39;thats not a plane, is it?&#39;.. &#39;is that a blimp?&#39;.. &#39; what is that?&#39;.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My mother knew a lady in the park that had many cameras and we went to ask her to come out to photograph this thing.The woman became angry and refused to come and see the shape and told us to go away. We returned to our house and the shape had slowly drifted south from where we first spotted it. The air temperature was very cold and there were no other people around to alert them to this shape. The shape continued to move south and we watched it until it was no longer visible. I guess the most unsettling things about this sighting were that it was so silent and so slow in moving. Given that we lived in a mountainous and remote area it was shocking to see this perfect triangle floating above the woods.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date may be approximate, although the witness does not indicate that fact.

1/15/75 16:00|Pipestone|MN|Sphere|5 minutes|1970's sighting of small UFO that hovered, maneuvered, split into two objects, then rejoined and flew off.|4/16/05|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/042/S42594.html|5|ndxe197501| 1970&#39;s sighting of small UFO that hovered, maneuvered, split into two objects, then rejoined and flew off.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This happened in 1974 or &#39;75, when I was about 15 years old.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It occured on a winter weekend, in January, in my home town of Pipestone, Minnesota; a small (5000 pop.) rural town in the southwestern part of the state.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was home alone as my parents were away for the weekend.  Two school friends, brothers, who lived across the street had a couple of snowmobiles, and we spent the latter part of the afternoon riding their sleds in an undeveloped area on the south edge of town, a few blocks from where we lived.  Late afternoon, almost dusk, we went back home.  I wandered out into the street between our houses while I was waiting for them to put their sleds away in their garage.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was just sort of looking around, and noticed a lighted object in the sky approaching from the southwest, roughly from the direction of the field in which we had been snowmobiling.  It appeared to be a single object with two lights, one red and one white.  I believe one of the lights was blinking, but I can&#39;t remember now which color it was.  I assumed at this point that it was a small private plane, as the town had a small municipal airport and it wasn&#39;t unusual to see small single-prop planes in the area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object continued to approach until it was directly overhead, then turned east flying directly over the street I was standing on.  It moved a short distance straight east, maybe a block or two, then stopped and hovered.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object appeared to me only as two glowing globes of light, red and white, stuck together like two beads or marbles that are touching (they did appear to have dimension, i.e. the glowing lights were definitely spherical, not just point sources of light).  I saw no other structure, so I don&#39;t have a good reference for determining the size of the object - however I should note that although it was right about dusk, there was still some daylight, and had it been a small plane or helicopter I would surely have seen the structure (there were no helicopters in town anyway).<n> <n><n> <n><n> As to height, based on how it later flew away (below), it seems the height was modest as the object disappeared below a nearby tree line before travelling very far, so I would guess it was roughly a few hundred feet - no more than 1000 - off the ground.  If this is true, then the object was not very large - perhaps the size of a car or truck.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Anyway, after hovering for perhaps 10 - 20 seconds, the object moved directly back along the way it had come, straight back west over the street until it was directly overhead, and then it stopped &amp; hovered again.  It did not turn or maneuver like an airplane would have to, it had simply moved straight backward along its original line of flight after hovering.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At this point I was almost in shock at what I was seeing, and just stood there staring at it.  If one of the lights had been blinking earlier as it approached, neither one was now - both lights were glowing steadily.   It hovered directly overhead for another 10-20 seconds, then the two lights separated and moved apart.  One light moved north a short distance, the other moved south a short distance, and it seemed that there was a thin glowing filament connecting the two.  The filament seemed to gradually fade away until I could no longer see anything connecting the lights.  (I suppose the filament could have been an afterimage in my eyes created by the movement of the lights, but it didn&#39;t seem to me that the lights were so bright as to have had that effect - but maybe...  The lights were not bright like a spotlight, more of a strong but soft glow.)  The apparent separation between them was probably not much more than the apparent distance between my hands if I hold my arms straight up overhead.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The lights stopped &amp; hovered in this position,  separated from each other, for another 10-20 second interval, then moved back together and  &#34;rejoined&#34;.  After another short interval just hanging there hovering straight above me, the recombined object moved slowly away to the southeast.   At no time during all of this did the object make any noise at all - it was totally silent.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Once it started moving away I kind of &#34;snapped out&#34; of the almost-trance I had been in while watching it, realized that someone else should see this too, and yelled for my friends to come see.  (I don&#39;t mean to imply that the object had directly affected me by using the word &#34;trance&#34;, but while watching it I was completely focused-in on what I was seeing &amp; oblivious to all else, could hardly believe what I was seeing, and it did not occur to me to call to my friends until it started moving away.)<n> <n><n> <n><n> One of my friends came to see what the fuss was about, but by the time he got there the object was some distance away and all he saw was a moving light in the sky, which he took to be a small plane.  The object continued to move away until it drifted below the tops of the trees on the next city block in the line of sight, and we lost sight of it - I would guess it might have been a half mile away at that point.  As far as I know, no one else in town reported anything strange that day.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of sighting is approximate.  PD))<n>

I was alone. Observed a bright white light move rapidly from left to right, above and in front of me. (Could not judge size but appeared to be slightly larger than a plane would have been.) Approx. 10 - 20 seconds later, what I took to be the same object came back accross the highway in the opposite direction, only at much slower speed and was amber in color. I observed the object move slowly off to the left (to the NE) where it appeared to stop and &#34;hover&#34; in the sky. Object then suddenly changed to a bright red color. (As if someone had simply turned a light switch ..... it just changed color.) Lost sight of the object behind the tree line  as I continued South. No sound(s) were noticed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Not much to add from summary description above other than it was quite upseting. (Scared the &#34;hell&#34; out of me.) Somehow had the feeling the object knew i was observing it or that it was observing me. Didn&#39;t wait around to find out. Unfortunately traffic was very light at that late hour. I did not notice any other cars on the road during this time. As stated above the object appeared to be a bright white light, moving rapidly from left to right directly in front and above my location. given my direction of travel it seemed to be going from the NE to SW. My first thought was that it was a plane but was going much too fast. Only seconds later the light came back into my view over the tree line, now  going in the opposite direction (from SW to NE) only much slower than before.(Note, while briefly out of my sight the object appeared to have changed to an amber color.) As I proceeded along the highway for approx. anothr 2 - 3 miles I had the object in my sight off to the left. It seemed to stop completely, hover for several seconds, then changed to a red color very suddenly. I became quite frightned, never having seen anything like this. (And being alone on the highway late at night.) I got the hell out of there as fast as I could. I do not recall any sounds associated with the object. I did not think the object was a plane or helicopter. Light did not blink. Flight path seemed to be extremely straight ..... precise is probably a better description. No banking, bouncing, blowing in the wind, or sudden altitude changes, etc. Just a straight line .... first a bright light very fast from left to right. Then back the other way much slower .... now amber in color. Moving slowly, slowly slowly off to the left then stopping. Then BANG a change to red. It was, however, a long time ago. Incident is still quite clear in my mind though.<n>

My mother, 12 yr old brother, 6 year old son, and 3 yr old niece were with me.  We had been visiting my grandparents and had left at 10:00 pm.  (THE TIME IS VERY IMPORTANT.  WE ALWAYS LEFT AT 10PM BECAUSE THAT&#39;S WHEN MY GRANDPARENTS WATCHED THE 10:00 NEWS AND IT WAS OUR SIGNAL TO GO HOME.)  At that time I always drove in the right or slower lane.  It was clear - no rain or fog.  We were coming to the exit to Ellington AFB which was approx. 2 miles to our right or east of the freeway.  I saw a well-lit object on the ground to our right and pointed it out to my family.  I pulled onto the shoulder and was trying to talk my brother into getting out with me to take a closer look.  My mother became hysterical and insisted I get back on the highway and so I did.  No one else stopped during this time, although I could see cars coming in the opposite direction from Houston and on the exit overpass. At that time, the area was not developed as it is now.  It was mostly used for cattle to roam about and feed on.  An almost continuous barbed wire fence about 4 ft high ran alongside the feeder road about 10 feet from the curb.  The fencing had been there for years.  The object was in front of a small grove of trees on the opposite side of the fence from us.  We could see the upper part of it but not the bottom and I am assuming this was because of the uncut grass and bushes that usually grew up alonside the fence.  The object was about 20 ft wide and 10 ft high.  It emitted a bluish-white light from the entire object.  I could tell it was round because the light was rotating in a counterclockwise pattern (my left to right as I viewed it), reflecting off the treetops when it got to the most extreme right of the object and before it reappeared on the left.  The best comparison I can make is that of a lighthouse.  I could make out rectangles set longside down, rounded edges rather than squared off, and set within a thin frame.  Each was the height of the object and several feet long.  The entire object emitted this light and in addition, each rectangle got extra bright in the counterclockwise sequence, one after the other.  This was also apparent when the light was reflecting off the trees.  We didn&#39;t hear any sounds, but we had our windows rolled up.  That&#39;s about it!<n>

It happened to my wife, not me, but I have a better command of the language and will relate exactly what she described to me.  It is a fascinating event.<n> <n><n> <n><n> She was at the &#34;Mile High Drive In&#34; theater in Denver, Colorado.   Although my wife doesn&#39;t remember the year, she does remember that the movie playing was &#34;Dr Zchivago&#34;.  Everyone there suddenly saw a huge flying saucer slowly rising up behind and somewhat to the left of the screen.  Everyone got out of their cars and watched as this thing slowly rose, with lights circling its perimeter, then came to a complete standstill, hovering.  As they continued to watch it just sit there, it eventually then tilted to a 45-degree angle and then suddlenly just ZIPPED out of sight in the blink of an eye.  Everyone was astounded.  That&#39;s it.  And of course she&#39;s been a believer ever since.  There is, however, an interesting little footnote to this event...<n> <n><n> <n><n> About a year ago, my wife was watching an old UFO docu-drama on tv, and some lecturer or news reporter described exactly the event she witnessed.  This leads me to think the event was indeed documented, but I have searched the internet, and cannot find any such record of the event.  I would be extremely grateful to you, Peter, if you could provide me with any information about this event.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

I do not recall that it made any sound, but at moments it appeared to be elliptical and the intensity of the light it emitted would rise and fall as it changed shape.  I do not recall the exact date but I couldn&#39;t have been more than six years of age.  I am now 34 and I remember it as if it were yesterday.  This may be related to a simular report which I have included below.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date of sighting above is approximate.

Object paralleled us as we drove slowly, stopping when we stopped going when we started again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> we drove about 5 miles slowly but took old Warm Springs Rd. instead of 4 lane into Columbus. As dusk was almost complete I got out and walked toward it and watched for some 10-15 minutes. Suddenly I had the feeling it was gone but the object simply faded slowly as if it left behind a mist. Within the haze red green and bluish lights could be seen moving but did not seem to be spot lights, more like flood lights. It was strange that it stayed with us for so long staying the same distance and height above the trees from us except when we turned off it crossed eaterly to the opposite side of the road. Although the timeframe was long neither my (now ex-)wife noticed any missing time. it was truly remarkable to us from when first seen it was so bright and moved rather rapidly but as it slowed and paralleled us through this little &#34;speed-trap&#34; town it got dimmer and changed from the bright full moon shape to the definite football shape. It seemed to us we were seeing it edge-on as it paralleled us. Numerous other cars behind us should have seen it also but noone stopped and watched but us. I had a camera with me but had used up the film. On a recent get together in Ga when my mother died, my ex-wife and I discussed this event and she seemed to remember it the same as I remember it. Later that month we moved to Texas.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

I was in my parent house on Moon Rd., Woke up in the middle of the night.  Looked out the window. saw a SMALL round object at max three feet.  up in the pine trees.  houvering.  Asked a friend sleeping over to look.  She was scared.  watched it.  It moved a bit.  Ran down and woke up parents. By then it was gone.  Never reported because it was so small (didn&#39;t ever hear of SMALL ones.  It had light all around it.  It appeared to make no sound.  Just saw one.  Probably not usable since it was so long ago and no witnesses.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have a Masters in Admin of Law.  Worked as a cop for six years. Now teach high school.  Was riding around with a sheriff (you cannot use this) from the next county five years ago and asked if they ever has UFO sightings.  He said there were some in the 70&#39;s and a couple of officers reported them.  They were flown down to Washington. And when they  came back they reported NOTHING.  My ex partner who worked for a time in West Ellicott, NY, went up to a golf course after reports and found a scorched part.  There was a pond nearby and all the fish were floating on top.<n>
1/1/75 01:00|Goree/Mineral Wells (between)|TX|Light|3-4 hours|saw a plane,bright light beside it then beind it then back beside it a 100 feet or so. 500 Lights On Object0: Yes|7/10/10|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/076/S76294.html|16|ndxe197501| Saw a plane, bright light beside it then beind it then back beside it a 100 feet or so.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was hitchiking to Mineral Wells Texas from Goree Texas.  It was very late approx 1 AM.  I was on a farm market road.  There was no traffic.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was walking along and looked up and saw a airplane I could hear.  I saw a very bright light flying beside the plane, the plane was a comercial plane.  I watched it a minute or so and looked back where I was walking.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A few secound later I look back up and it is flying behind the plane.  I looked back down and then back up and it was flying beside it again. The hair on my neck stood up.  I was honestly scared.  I saw a house about 3-4 hundred yards off the highway with lights on.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I decided to go to it to see if I might use the phone to call my recruiter to come and pick me up.  I had to go over 4 bobwire fences to get to the house.  I knocked on the door and a very harsh voice asked who is it.  I asked to use the phone.  He yelled out you better get out of here before I shoot you.  I didn&#39;t waist any time leaving. I crossed over 2 of the fences in a run and as I was going over the third fence I heard shots and heard pellets landing all around me.  From there I cannot tell you anything.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The next thing I remember is being in my recruiters car and pulling into his driveway.  I cannot tell you how I got in his car, how I contacted him to get him to pick me up in his car.  I cannot tell you going over the forth fence or getting on the highway.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When we were pulling up in his driveway it was just starting to get light outside.  So I am missing 4-5 hours that I cannot account for.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I contacted MUFON but they seem to be a joke.  Talked to a man over Skype, can&#39;t remenber his name,seen him as we talked.  I told him my story and this thing I have in my body.  It&#39;s a tiny spot like a ball.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They told me they were putting together a bus with Xray equipment and would come and Xray this spot and see if it might be a implant.  I told him I can show him lights in the sky every clear night that I cannot explain.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I promise you they are not of this earth.  You can&#39;t just look up and see them, there is a way to do it to be able to spot them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> These lights do very strange things that aircraft doesn&#39;t do.  Like dog fighting,getting extreamly bright and then just vanishing.  Sorry but I don&#39;t think planes do that.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))<n>
