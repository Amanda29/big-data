I could see the Orion constellation was coming more into view as it got darker and I began looking at the Big Dipper.  I looked back at Orion 2 minutes later and there were 3 white lights hovering directly between me and the Orion constellation.  The lights appeared over the Horsehead Nebula, forming a perfect triangle and were rotating in sync and heading west at a particularly slow pace.  After 3 minutes they had floated completely out of the Orion constellation.  The lights, which shone brighter than the stars themselves slowly dimmed and the lights disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> No craft was observed visually, only lights. There was no sound.<n>

The 3 lights were in a triangle with one of the pointed ends facing down towards the earth.  Then all 3 lights (in complete unison) started moving slowly towards the sky, they then slowly faded out and disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> From where we were siting, the triangle of lights were in the sky starting at about 25 degrees , then rose to about just under 40 degrees before disappearing.  The size of the triangle was approximately the equivalent of at least 5-6 full moons in the night sky (it was fairly large).<n> <n><n> <n><n> This happened at about 11:00PM on June 30th, 2013 and lasted for just under 1 minute.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have a wife and 2 children and run and Information Technology company here in Victoria.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is the first time in my life that I have seen something that, up to this point, my wife or myself cannot explain.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We are very curious to know what exactly we were looking at last night.<n>

6/30/13 23:00|Harison|MT|Light|10 minutes|Large bright white light, flashing smaller white lights like high beams on a car moving very slowly in the sky above us.|7/3/13|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/099/S99066.html|4|ndxe201306| Large bright white light, flashing smaller white lights like high beams on a car moving very slowly in the sky above us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This will be the second in identified object my girlfriend and I have witnessed together (11/12 red orb in bozeman) we witnessed the third together tonight as we were unloading the boat at our house returning from Harrison Mt.  I just want to say that we have been noticing more and more things in the night sky since our first report but nothing as obviouse as what I will report here tonight.  I will report the second one in another report next.  What we saw last night was a large bright light directly above we&#39;re we we standing.  This light caught our attention by flashing smaller bright lights on and off. It was like someone was flashing an led flashlight at us. It was moving very very slowly north, we could barely confirm its movement; that&#39;s how slow it was.  The large light itself would e very large if it was a physical object.  The way it flashed those little light was very strange, it was like it was taking picture or trying to get our attention.  I really c! an&#39;t explain it well enough for it to make sense to even myself.  We also thought we saw much smaller reddish lights moving into and away from the bright light, even around it; but we couldn&#39;t be sure because it seemed like they were hard to see, and thought it was an optical illusion from string so long.  We eventually went back inside, but I could have watched it for a long time I feel like.<n>
6/30/13 23:00|Bozeman|MT|Unknown|3 minutes|White flash, traveling light, bright white light.|7/3/13|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/099/S99084.html|5|ndxe201306| white flash, traveling light, bright white light<n> <n><n> <n><n> Second sighting in 12 hours; we witness one last night at what I just realized was at the same time.  We had just gotten home from Harrison Mt and I was walking out from our house to unload the boat.  My sight was drawn up to the sky by a bright flash of light  coming from the south, it was exactly like we saw last night; a led flash light being switched on and off again.  I thought it was my mind playing tricks, but as I watched I noticed a light red dim light that was traveling north,  I could guage its movement by the stars that it passed.  Its speed seemed slow but at a steady pace.  I called for my girlfriend and finally had to run in and grab her to come out.  I thought I missed showing it to her but she spotted it still going north but it was behind us above our house.  We couldnt believe what happened next.  The light disappeared and reappeared kept its pace until it disappeared again for a few seconds.  When it disappeared there was what we assumed was a bri! ght star diagonally next to that area.  We stared up looking for it to reappear again when it came out of the star following the diagonal course directly back to were it originally disappeared and just sat there; motionless.  Where it was until a light cloud cover came in and filed out all the stars.  I will be watching the sky every night, I feel this is something special, that can&#39;t be ignored.<n>
6/30/13 23:00|Louisville|KY|Unknown|2-3 minutes|A group of at least 100 lights in the sky on Sunday night, June 30, 2013 at 11 p.m.|7/14/13|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/099/S99868.html|6|ndxe201306| A group of at least 100 lights in the sky on Sunday night, June 30, 2013 at 11 p.m.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 06/30/13 Sunday Night at 11 p.m.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My husband and I saw a group of at least 100 lights in the sky on Sunday night, June 30, 2013. This happened at 11 p.m.  The lights traveled east to west and were gone in a matter of 2 to 3 minutes. They may have been traveling along the Ohio River.<n> <n><n> <n><n> These lights were fairly high in the sky, upper cloud level, and moved at a fast past. The group seemed to swarm across the sky.  There were some near the edges of the group, the group was traveling in a rather loose round or ball shape.  Near the edges of the circle there were lights that were moving in and out of the group.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There were also stragglers that quickly caught up with the group as they moved across the sky.  These lights appeared smallish and they had blinking red, blue, green, yellow lights.  These color-changing lights appeared to be like an LED light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have lived near the airport almost all my life and have never seen or experience anything like I saw that night.  There was no nose.  There was no wind, at least at the ground level on that evening.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was so shaken; I placed a call to 911 and sent an email to the local television station.  I thought for sure someone else would have seen the phenomenon but I cannot find any other report online.<n>
6/30/13 22:50|Plum|PA|Fireball|1 minute|3 fireballs in the night sky perfectly lined up diagonally.|7/3/13|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/099/S99104.html|7|ndxe201306| 3 fireballs in the night sky perfectly lined up diagonally<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was out at about 10:30 PM. On Sunday June 30th 2013. I went to a gas station in the Holiday Park section of Plum right by the McDonalds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I grabbed my usual pack of smokes and a tea.  Nothing seemed unusual about this night (unlike other times I&#39;ve spotted UFO&#39;s).  Well I decided to drive through Holiday Park to smoke my ciggarette, while driving down O&#39;Block a bright fire like object caught my eye in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Naturaly with seeing UFO&#39;s on more than one occasion I knew immediately I needed to get to a higher ground for better view (I was in a valley surrounded by trees).  Luckily to my advantage right next to me was the entrance to Larry Mills Park, the highest point in this neighborhood.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I was working my way up the hill I kept checking my mirror to see if the object was still there.  I lost sight on it for a moment and thought it was gone.  As I got to the top I put my car in park and checked the mirror and to my surprise it was still hovering there.  I got out of my car and when turned around to face the object to my surprise not only was the light still there, but two others accompanied it.  They sat still, and motionless in the sky, not making a noise.  I quickly leaned into my vehicle to retrieve my phone and I stated recording the events.  About 5 seconds after I stated recording the light up highest quickly dimmed and disappeared.  Than about 10 seconds later the middle light did the same, with another passing 10 seconds the farthest left one dimmed, slightly glided to the right, and went black, and they were gone.  On the video it is not very clear because of a bad lighting situation at the park, BUT I did manage to snap a still image from the video and enhance the brightness and contrast and you can see the objects half decently. I know this is a very bad short description but I felt it needed reported.  I know it clearly says do not post private info but if anyone else saw this object that night, which I know 3 others report! ed it, please contact my UFO email ((e-address deleted)) with info on what you saw!<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thank you!<n>

I watched it for a few moments and noticed it was rectangular in shape and floating to the south.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had to judge it was about five miles or more away from me and was going to be hid by trees across the street.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I rushed through the house, and to the nearest intersection but it was gone before I got there.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Object was as described rectangular in shape standing up on end where it was taller than it was wide.  It appeared as it was flame because it flickered like a fire and Orange-Yellow in color.  It was not Venus as I located it behind a tree, nor was it a plane unless it was on fire which I do not think it was as it was traveling from north to south.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Also I do not believe it could have been fireworks due to height several thousand feet.<n>

Object was first spotted over Granite Mountain(where the latest Doce Fire took place) heading east at a high rate of speed.  It passed through the clouds, directly over us. Not a usual flight pattern even for the drone testing performed here.  Watched the object keep its continuous, high rate of speed for nearly 30 seconds.  Object was silent and rather large(30-100ft), estimated 7,000ft-10,000ft above.<n>

The red glowing orb seemed  to slow down giving itself some distance and then seemed to stop or moving extremely slow.  The orb then shifted its path southward and then started a moving up and the light started to fade.  As the light ascended, it grew dimmer until it faded out of sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Flight path of object was same as Jets flying overhead and same height, helicopters do not follow the same path, height or speed, light was a strong and steady red, brighter than the headlights of a jetliner.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was a clear night, no clouds, visibility of flights were clear and easily visible and identifiable.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I had contact with alien beings in my bedroom.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I hope this is the proper place for such a report.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It happened sometime in 2013.  I was in bed sleeping, when at approximately 3a.m.  I was woken up after feeling something touch my forehead.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I opened my eyes, and I saw that my bedroom was flooded in a sort of red color.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was lying on my back and I looked up the wall above my headboard, and was shocked to see a doorway coming out of my wall.  There were two men side by side, and I could see a stairway going up into total darkness,  The men appeared to be wearing leather jackets!  They appeared to me men and both had thick wavy black hair.<n> <n><n> <n><n> One of them pointed what I thought was a gun at my forehead, and for a second, I really though I was going to be shot in the head.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was partially paralyzed, but I was able to raise my right arm enough to actually get a hole of the man holding the &#34;guns wrist&#34; I then saw what looked like tiny blue lights where the open end of a gun&#39;s barrel would be. There was a dull white light slightly larger than the tiny blue lights which went around the tip of the &#34;gun&#34; in a circle.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I saw that it was not a gun, but it was roughly the same shape as a hand gun, only a little thicker down the barrel and tapering off where the lights were. It appeared to be some kind of shiny plastic.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They put the tip of the gun like instrument against my forehead, and at that point, both men has a perplexed expression on their faces. It appeared that they were confused at whatever it was they may have been expecting to see.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I managed to push the man&#39;s wrist up and away from my head, with what seemed to me to be very little effort. I had the feeling that they were not allowed to resist me if I attempted to push them away. That is why, I afterwards, reasoned that I managed to push his hand away so easily.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Suddenly, they were just gone, and my wall was normal again. It took a while for me to be able to move normally, and I was able to see my wife had slept right through the entire episode. There was a dim red glow on my ceiling for about ten or so minutes after they had disappeared. I could see red catching the tiny lumps off my stuccoed ceiling for quite some time as it slowly dissipated.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I didn&#39;t have any fear except for slightly, when I thought I was going to be shot, but even then, not as much fear as I would expect to have had my life actually been threatened like that. It seemed to me whoever they were, they were able tocontrol my emotions and my body.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A few months after that experience, I was watching a television program, where investigators were attempting to make contact with &#34;ghosts&#34; Ghost Adventures, was the name of that show.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I saw one of their cameras had the exact same color of blue, and the exact same size and configuration as the instrument which had been used on my forehead. The camera itself was much bigger, but the tiny blue lights were the same size.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It turned out to be an infra red camera. I thought they all used red lights, however, this camera, used blue.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My wife had no recollection of anything out of the ordinary, nor did our three adult sons.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have not had any further incidents.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The experience was real, not a dream, of that I am certain.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am a bible believing Christian, and I honestly feel that kept them from doing whatever it was they had come to do.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thank you for your time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> J.C.<n>

PD))<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is NOT a photo that i took.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A Persian friend (Iranian) here in London highlighted it to me and although I cannot sensibly determine much, it does appear to have captured something triangular in flight overhead (perhaps you can analyse a sense of dimension to it).<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first glance, the image appears to be a black triangular flag, but upon zooming in overhead, one can reasonably assume that the black triangle is higher above.  If you can dismiss/explain the object in the photo (is it a software/stitching flaw caused by the 360 degree nature of the camera shot?<n> <n><n> <n><n> Other shots from the same photographer have no such issues though...), would still very much appreciate your doing so online for all to see/understand. I am not sure if the fact that this photo is taken in Iran makes it more, or less, compelling! But it&#39;s definitely interesting!

We were waiting in a line of semi trucks to enter the garage area when we witnessed the first two objects rise from the horizon behind the building to our east. The objects in question appeared to come from the Upland, IN area and proceed to the south west. The objects were reddish orange in color and were rising into the sky. Both were moving parallel to each other at the same speed and distance.  They continued up into the clouds to our south and disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The third object appeared from the same location as the first two, roughly one minute later.  This was the same color as the others and followed the same general path in the sky. The object rose into the sky and disappeared behind the clouds the same as the first two.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The fourth object followed about forty five seconds later while we were watching the third object disappear, and did as described above. Same orange color with a slight flicker to it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The sky was overcast. The objects in question were approximately the size of a pencil eraser held out at arms length.  The time was approximately 23:15 to 23:30. No fireworks were occurring at this time. The objects looked like balls of fire.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My wife and Myself witnessed this as well as another truck driver, his wife, a mechanic, and a man that works at the guard gate to the facility.  My wife was able to get a video of the first two objects moving parallel to one another, but the Iphone 5 video camera will not zoom.  She took still photos of the third object with the camera zoomed in.  The fourth object was not captured due to us talking to witnesses and leaving our phones in the cab of the truck.<n>

At times, they all moved toward each other, at other times seemed to be following each other from right to left and back around.  They disappeared behind clouds and re-emerged on the other side of the cloud.  As a group, they slowly headed west, until we could no longer see them. 4 of us from two different households saw the lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

They where the brightest things in the sky and looked to be bigger than the couple stars I could see.<n> <n><n> <n><n> One light flickered out and a minute later I could tell it was moving toward me.  It came from the north west and going south east.  It went over head and I could see it go behind a cloud for a second so I know it must of been quite high.  Trailing behind it and to the side I could make out a grey circular object that was not lite up but at least 10x bigger than the red light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It could of been the first object that disappeared and was now just following the first. It appeared to be high as well like a plane with no lights, I couldn’t really make any details out other than it looked grey or white and a lot bigger than the small red ball.<n>

We were near a lake McClaine.  The four lights at first appeared stationary over the west shore of the small lake.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When we realized they were moving we pulled the car off the road, turned the engine off, radio off, fan off, lights off.  We realized one of the lights was going to pass right over us and we wanted to determine if there were any engine noises.  None.  Completely silent.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We got out of the car.  The lights at first seemed to be moving in the same direction but then separated.  Oh, they were at first moving from North to South.  Then, one moved west and vanished, we thought into the haze.  One disappeared before it got to us, one to the east and vanished.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The one that moved above us was pulsing as it continued to the south, and then the light went out and we saw a dark mass continue moving to the south.  The sky was hazy, not quite dark, but full of twilight.  I could not take my eyes away, and it did not occur to me to try to get a video as I did not want to miss any part of the event.  Then it was over.  It lasted for about three minutes or so.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am wondering what it could have been and if anyone else reported seeing it.  In retrospect I cannot determine the altitude.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first my friend thought they were the top lights of four transmission towers, and that they were near the lake.  But then we think it is possible they were very very high, and at first very far away, but moving rapidly towards us to give the appearance of being stationary.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I tried to determine if, after the lights went out, if there was perhaps some debris that would be falling.  Instead what I saw was the dark mass continue moving at the same pace as the light was.  It did not lose altitude.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We argued for some time as to the nature of the event.  I said it was a phenomena.  He explained it as an explosion of some kind, perhaps a meteor or an aircraft, but we do not know of anything that would burn like that.  It seemed somewhat ethereal.<n> <n><n> <n><n> He also said that he thought the dark mass may have been smoke because it appeared to expand.  I did not see smoke, there was no smoke trail behind it.  Yet we both agreed that the way that it moved was inexplicable.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When we got home less than an hour later he called our local police as well as Superior Wisconsin to report it.  I went to the internet to see if anyone else was talking about it.  That is how I found your page, and I called you.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke via telephone with this witness, and she sounded to us to be quite sober-minded and credible.

I heard my son yelling for me to come look at something in the sky.  I looked up and seen a bright orange ball of fire and told my son it must be an asteroid.  He then said look there are 3 more all flying North to South at about (Estimate 10,000 feet up.  Then 5 more came from the same direction then the rest were one after another all pretty much in line with each other.  Not a sound was heard from any of them and they were moving pretty fast.

She mentioned they looked like a murder of crows going to roost.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As we watch them move from the North to South, they started to disappear.  The night was clear and we could see some early stars where they were disappearing.  They just kept coming on a relative same direction, but other than that they didn’t appear to be following any type of formation.  Some seemed to be coming more in an South East direction toward us, then would fade away.  There were at least a couple dozen of them.  They would seem to end, and then a few more would come from the same general direction.  All heading in a Southern direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Toward the end, one looked like it was almost coming toward us more than the others.  When I thought that I should surely hear some sound from it by now, it just faded away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have a video form my cell phone, but I’m not sure how it turned out.  I haven’t look at it yet.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We continued to walk out dog (who also seemed a little nervous, I’m not sure if she picked up my wife’s attitude about the lights or if she sensed something, but she wanted us to pick her up).  We kept looking back to the West and kept seeing a few more.  The last one faded out somewhat earlier than the others, but none of them did at the same area, but most did later in their journey.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We finally got home, and almost exactly an hour later (11:10pm) we saw one more while we were in the house.  We couldn’t help but keep looking.<n> <n><n> <n><n> If you have any other reports I would love to know.  If someone knows what it is, I’d like to know that as well.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I’ve live here my whole life, and I’ve never seen anything like this.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thank you.<n>

6/29/13 21:40|Baldwinsville|NY|Circle|3 minutes|Three orange orb-like structures were seen for around 3 minutes.|7/3/13|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/099/S99046.html|38|ndxe201306| Three orange orb-like structures were seen for around 3 minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This occurred when everyone in my family was waiting to take a dog walk. My mom was outside and when I went out she said to come over quickly to where she was in the road. She then pointed into the sky towards the west where there was an orange orb-like thing that is probably one of the “fireballs” everyone else has been talking about.  The structure was moving east, but more towards the southeast.  About 30 seconds later, a second orb appeared and was moving in the exact path of the one in front of it.  I then ran inside to get binoculars with my brother and when we came outside the two we had seen previously had vanished.  According to my parents who were still outside when we went in, they had just disappeared a little after we had gone inside.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After we were out with our binoculars, about 30 seconds late when we were just looking around, another orb appeared in the west, but this one appeared brighter and also looked as if it either had two sections to it or it was two orbs in tandem with each other.  After about 10 seconds, they had joined and there was only one bright orange orb there moving southeast like the others.  When I was looking at it through the binoculars I started to notice this black circle starting to engulf it.  I kept watching, as was my brother, and we both looked away in amazement when we saw it turn completely black. We thought it was gone like the others, but then my brother noticed a black dot in the sky that was really weird to see.  This was just after the sunset, so there was some light in the sky still. We went over to look at it and it was still moving after stopping briefly in the sky. It then moved towards the direct south and then began to move down.  We couldn’t see it after that, so we d! on’t know if it landed or if it was just moving out of our view in the sky. The orb looked a lot smaller with the binoculars on rather than the naked eye and the majority of the light looked like it was coming from the top of it. Also, we were talking about it after and we were wondering if the structure cut its power to either go in orbit or maybe even land. My mom was waving to them in the air and she thinks she saw them stop when she waved. However, she says there’s a chance it could be her imagination, but you never know with these! This isn’t our first encounter with these. Two summers while we were camping in the Adirondacks, we saw two very bright orange orbs that were pretty close to each other. This is interesting to me because on the website here it says the reports mostly were after June 2012 and this would’ve been July 2011. Also, my parents saw a whole group of them form some sort of a pattern last summer when they were coming back from a concert. They stopped on the road a got to see the whole “show,” but when they called me and my brother at home they were gone and we didn’t get to see them. I have no idea what these are, but I do look forward to hopefully seeing more in the future!<n>

Immediately she called my attention to the part of the sky that is visible below the porch’s roofline and to a bright orange.  From there we both witnessed it slowly and silently float toward the E/NE.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At the time the conditions outside were wet and very overcast.  This orange orb traversed our field of view in approximately ten seconds, which led me to believe that it was not a Chinese lantern.  In fact my first thought was that it could be a meteor however I feel that it moved to slowly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I mentioned the weather was poor and the clouds were low but I can’t say for certain what altitude the orb was traveling at.  If I were to guess I would say 300 to 500 feet. At our horizon, which due to our house being at the bottom of a hill was only maybe 100 yards from us, is a grouping of trees.  The orb passed over these trees and for a few seconds we could still see it through the branches and leaves on the other side.  Then it was gone. We came inside and noted that the time was 21:38.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As a side note the evening before this sighting my wife and I saw an unusual light over a mile to the east.  It moved very slowly and in our opinion was either a helicopter, though we heard no sound or a balloon, though it moved quicker than I feel a balloon would.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After last night I can only say it was a UFO.<n>

I initially submitted a report to MUFON on July 4th, 2013, and I was shortly contacted by a MUFON investigator to come and visit our home. Sometime after he was suppose to come I had one occurrence late one evening with a helicopter which overflew my home under 500 feet and maybe 40-60 knots of airspeed.  First time was with a searchlight and second time which occurred within 10 minutes roughly; it was blacked out with just one red strobe on the tail.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I did write this MUFON investigator and informed him about it, and he’d seemed intrigued. Well, long story short he never did come and never contacted me again.  I followed up this previous December about why did he never follow up with me.  Real quickly, the reason I waited so long was because I thought maybe this guy thinks I’m full of s@#$ and I didn’t want to be too persistent to possibly make him think i’m overbearing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So I got a response to my concerns about why I was never contacted from the state director of MUFON from NC. It seems that the initial investigator fell very ill, and then my case got pawn off and they explained that it was a very rare meteorological event that we witnessed. Overall I have a gut feeling that there is something strange about this event. Any info would be great.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Here is the Original report, “My wife and me were outside on the deck watching the thunderstorm approach from the southwest when out of no where a reddish orange fog or cloud appeared. It started out dull in brightness but soon got brighter and brighter and was in my opinion roughly 10 to 15 miles away. As it was becoming brighter it was making its way towards our direction from the southwest and the closes it came was roughly 1/4 of a mile from us. This event lasted roughly 10 minutes and it gave my wife and I a strong feeling of eeriness as it was making progress towards us and becoming bigger and bigger. The weird thing is we never saw a distinct detailed craft, we only saw a glowing fog or cloud that seemed to have intelligent control. This dense fog or cloud just dissipated after getting that close to us and it took roughly 2-3 seconds for it to disappear. If anything has any idea what this was please add on your opinion. Also there was no noise only a creepy feeling.”<n>

I had a full view of the sky &amp; a very bright oval object appeared in the sky, it just “blinked” into view , giving off a very bright blue/white light; the object was sold &amp; stationary.  It was a clear sky with no clouds &amp; no other objects or aircraft anywhere else in the sky &amp; there was no sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am an experienced skydiver with over 4,000 jumps from various altitudes up to 15,000 feet &amp; using my past experience of jump aircraft types &amp; size; I estimated the object was almost due west at between 5,000-7,000 feet with no movement vertically or horizontally.  It appeared as a solid shiny metallic &amp; oval in shape, no windows or other distinguishing features, I stopped my motorcycle &amp; shut off the engine, &amp; noted it made no sound,  I could hear the birds in the fields, confirming the lack of noise from the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After approximately one minute, the object just blinked out of sight &amp; the sky was again completely clear.  Based on my skydiving background,  I would estimate the object was between 60-80 feet wide &amp; 35-40 feet in height.<n>

My wife and I were lying in bed listening to Coast to Coast, with our drapes open on the large bedroom window that faces north waiting to see if we would be able to discern any aurora’s since there were some forecast from the web site she monitors.  One of our cats that is both epileptic and deaf was fussing at the foot of our bed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> She got up to put him on the foot of the bed, and as she came around her side of the bed she was looking out the window and described a very bright orange light coming from the north.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I rolled over on the bed to see as well, and sure enough, it looked to me to be an orange fireball type of object drifting slowly our way from the north no more than approximately 700 to 1,000 feet above our small town, so approximately 45 degrees from where we were since it was so close.  We both watched for a few minutes as it drifted toward our position. The screen made it look distorted so I grabbed my robe and went outside.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We keep my wife’s bird watching binoculars on a peg in our firewood awning for weird things like this, and as I grabbed them the object turned 90 degrees and started moving west.  As I looked at it through the binoculars, it looked to me like a bright orange spherical object emitting an orange misty halo around itself, which gave the illusion that the misty halo was trailing it almost like you would see with a cometary object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I pulled the binoculars from my eyes as it neared the ridge from my perspective of the small mountain to our west, and I was amazed to see it start to descend and dim as it entered into the trees on the side of the mountain!  I called to my wife to make sure I wasn’t seeing things, and she confirmed from the bedroom window that it had indeed descended into the trees up there!<n> <n><n> <n><n> She came outside then and we pulled up some lawn chairs to wait for it to reappear, but it never did, and there was no way I was going to drive out there to see if anything was there! Besides, it went into the forest maybe a quarter mile up the side of the mountain from where the road would be.  We waited for about 45 minutes, and then decided to go back in and go to sleep. It’s the weirdest thing we’ve both witnessed to date, but I did report an orange fireball the 4th of July to NUFORC that everyone at our BBQ witnessed about 3 years ago.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object was visible and moving slowly in plain view for roughly ten minutes until it faded into the forest. My wife wants to construct a floating lantern to experiment to see if it could have possibly been something like that, but it moved under its own power as there were no discernible winds that night and was extremely bright.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is my second report of unusual objects in our skies in as many weeks, with my earlier report being a broad daylight event June 15th.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am a full time non-traditional student and the president and founder of a 501(c)(3) here in Plummer, and my wife is a special education para-professional at our local school district.<n>

The fire burned on the top and looked as if it was shaped perfectly like a crown.

It was around 10:30 pm..sitting around the campfire. I have never seen something in the sky that I couldn&#39;t logically explain. As I was staring at the stars I noticed a HUGE white thing traveling in the sky between two of the brightest stars  in the sky. I believe now those stars to be Venus and Jupiter.  I am terrible with directions and angles, but I am pretty certain I was looking in the West.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I thought, &#34;It&#39;s to high and big to be a plane. It&#39;s to low and big to be a satellite.&#34;<n> <n><n> <n><n> I turned to a friend, pointed to the general location and said, &#34;What is that?&#34;  He was a local and familiar with anything and everything about the outdoors.  &#34;Umm..that&#39;s a plane. We should see it&#39;s lights here in a sec.&#34;<n> <n><n> <n><n> We engaged in a quick discussion about the objects activity while staring at it..really just waiting to see something else but the triangular bright white lights.  This object was steadily moving across the sky then suddenly started to ascend. In a fraction of a second shot, it straight up and disappeared. I was speechless.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am 47 years old and have spent countless hours gazing at the stars.  This was incredible.<n>

It also was not lightning, although there was a lot of activity in the sky tonight.<n>

The Orbs seemed to get brighter and brighter.  The Orbs would just come and go at different times - appearing out of no where.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Finally all 5 (five) appeared at once again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 3 (three) of the orbs formed a giant triangle shape formation while moving in the sky. The distance between each of these 3 (three) Orbs that made up the triangle shape formation was at least two hands held up in the sky apart from each other point in the formation of the triangle.  This lasted for at least 20 minutes or so all while making no sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then around 10:30 PM all the Orbs eventually disappeared behind some thin white clouds in the eastern sky...  My brother and at least 4 (four) neighbors who were pulling into their driveway all witnessed the same thing.  When the neighbors were getting out of their car – they asked me and my brother if we were looking at the UFOs and stated that they had been watching them too for a while in the car driving.  CRAZY!!!  I&#39;ve never seen anything like this...<n>

I looked into and saw what looked like an air balloon on fire.  I pulled out my phone and started to record it moving.  It was moving slowly across the sky a little bit faster than a plane would.  It continued to the left and I saw it move over towards a star pattern that was completely red.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As it moved to the top of the pattern they all formed into a vertical line.  They proceeded to disappear from top to bottom.<n>

I noticed a green light in the sky as i sat and ate.<n> <n><n> <n><n> so i got up to see what it was.  that&#39;s when i really started to see that it was very bright light moving back and forth in the sky, very unlike an airplane or a helicopter.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So i called it to the attention of everyone. there were about 10 witnesses to the event.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Everyone saw this thing glowing bright in the night sky. and it appeared to have a smaller reddish purple craft following it around. smaller.. or maybe not as bright.  it made hard turns in the sky and would disappear without warning and re-appear the same way.  At one point it dropped suddenly out of the sky as if it would a molten flame.  it disappeared below the tree line in the distance, only to reappear again in the sky.  truly an amazing site!   To get a better look i got out my binoculars.  This is when i realized it was something special.  Through the binoculars i could see it was an oval craft lined with what looked like 6-8 green light around the perimeter of the object.  and this is when i could see it turning and banking like a ship in the ocean.  making turns and even turning in a way that appeared to be upside down.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The purple craft was also the same shape.  But smaller in size.  And its had one red light on one of its sides.  it moved with the red light behind it, as if it were the back of the craft moving forward.  i (we) also saw this craft turning, banking fast and flipping over or.. doing upside down turns.  we all took cell phone videos. they came out OK.. not great, but you can see a green dot in the sky.  We continued to watch until they were gone for good.  we stayed outside for another 2 hours and nothing returned.  This not the first time ive seen stuff in the Covina area.  it seems to be a hot bed of activity over the last 10 years.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Looking through the binoculars was the best way to view it.  I find it hard to believe the whole town didn&#39;t see this event.  Many of the witnesses this night we non-believers and never seen anything before.  They have ALL changed their opinions! im excited to hear if anyone else saw this!!!<n>

Heard a familiar sound like a deep hollow thrust of a propane torch-down torch. Looked up at approximately 1 to 1.5 miles away and saw a black cylinder approximately 15 to 20+ feet long with dome, flying lower than the tree line (ridge) in the background.  &#34;It&#34; was heading east slow moving guessing travel 10 to 15 mph.  Then as it was slowly turning north I saw reflective silver edge... like window facing downward toward earth.  Looking at the back end was glowing flame at outer edge with center being dark, it began climbing.  As I continued hearing thrust sound I ran into the house to get my camera.  That took 40 seconds. I ran to the end of my property and began video.  By this time it was approximately 3 miles away and could see thrust still... then fading.  On my digital camera it appears tiny and focused.  With a magnifying glass you can see flame as it upturned then slowly the thrust died down.   The cylinder pointed upward and floated drifting with a wobble at the base, like a swaying motion.  Disappeared into the clouds.  I drew a picture and made a model of it just to make sense of it.<n>

We had a  bbq get together at work on June 28, 2013 at 1 PM.  We were sitting outside in the school courtyard as it was a nice and sunny day.  I was having a conversation with one of my colleagues, when I looked up towards the sun.  The sun was actually being blocked by the side brick wall of our building.  Right beside the sun, there was a silver sphere. It was quite small as it was very high up in the sky.  My colleague asked me what the heck I was looking at, and I pointed it to him. He saw it too.  I couldn&#39;t detect any motion at the time.  I got up and showed another colleague who was in the middle of a conversation with a few others.  She saw it.  Next thing I new everyone was looking up into the sky, with one hand up blocking the sun, and were all seeing this silver dot in the sky.  I ran into the building to get my phone and turn on the Skywalk app to see if it was Venus or possibly t! he ISS. I came back after about 20 seconds and the object was now to the left of the sun (it was to the right when i first saw it).  It still was not moving fast whatsoever. In fact, I thought it wasn&#39;t moving at all, and that&#39;s why I went to grab my phone...as I thought maybe I was looking at Venus (which would have blown me away seeing it in the day).  I checked Skywalk and it showed what was up there, but since the object moved, it certainly wasn&#39;t going to be Venus.  At this point my colleagues were concluding it was the ISS.  I explained that the ISS likely wouldn&#39;t be visible right next to the sun, and moves much much faster than this object and would be long gone by now. I would say the entire ordeal was about 4 or 5 minutes long.  Soon people lost interest and the bbq party continued and it was no longer visible. There is the chance that this was a weather balloon, but I have no way of knowing.  I just am not one to jump to major conclusions, but it was neat to see people&#39;s reactions and I was happy that I had between 20-30 people with me l ooking at the object at the time.  This obviously, eliminates anyone thinking I just have an over-active imagination.<n>

I let her out and waited about 15 minutes then started for the back door and noticed a big white light through the window.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My first thought was that it was a street light and maybe the storm had knocked down trees that normally block them on the next street over.  When I opened the door I saw the light was over the trees and moving very fast traveling East in the Northwest sky making no sound.  It was as large and bright as a streetlight!  I watched it for several seconds until it was blocked by a neighbor&#39;s tree.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I ran inside to grab my phone and headed out the front door but it was gone.  I went back in and out the backdoor to get my dog and she would not come to me.  She was crying and would not come out from underneath the house.  I finally had to coax her to come out.<n>

6/27/13 22:15|Independence|KY|Rectangle|1 minute|Gigantic lantern moves rapidly across sky in KY!|7/3/13|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/098/S98994.html|78|ndxe201306| Gigantic lantern moves rapidly across sky in KY!<n> <n><n> <n><n> Shortly after 10 pm tonight from my back porch, I witnessed a very strange object in the sky about a half mile to a mile away and about a half mile up.  I screamed for my wife to bring the camera.  She had to look for it and just grabbed her phone instead.  She took three photos but it took her 30 seconds to get her Iphone5 and by this time the object had moved well away.  Initially, the object was close enough to see the periphery, which clearly appeared to be rectangular with a giant white-orange flame inside that filled most of the rectangle shape but the flame did not extend beyond the well-defined rectangular borders.  For how bright the light inside the rectangle was, I was surprised to not see much of a halo of light around it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My first impression was that it was just a large hot air balloon because I heard what I thought was the sound of propane fuel burning.  I absolutely did not hear a intermittent propeller type sound.  It was definitely more of ! a low steady dull rumble sound.  I had a clear view of most of the horizon.  The object moved from left to right across it, at first very slowly then amazingly as fast as a jet airplane or faster.  It moved all the way across the sky easily in less than one minute. The object also without question was ascending rapidly.  It was moving east to southeast in direction in mostly clear skies at the time. The long axis of the rectangle seemed perpendicular to the ground at all times even though the pictures seem otherwise (my wife must have slanted the camera in her rapid response).  The pictures revealed almost a figure eight light source.  However, in person, the object looked very bright to the naked eye with a giant, uniform flame burning upwards, much like a gigantic lantern in the sky. Any insight into what this object was would be appreciated.  I thought hot air balloons just moved at the same speed as the wind.<n>

As an ex-USAF I know the characteristics of modern military aircraft.  These aircraft were anything but ordinary.  The objects flew together, there vector was west to east.  The objects first appeared they were at traveling at approximately 45 degrees above the horizon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The objects appeared to be under intelligent control.  When I first saw the objects they were moving at a high rate of speed.  After approximately 30 seconds they appeared to slow down.  The objects traveled together for approximately 1 minutes when one of the objects disappeared from sight.  It just appeared to vanish from sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The lone remaining object appeared to slow down considerably, stop and then alter course.  The object stopped for approximately 10 seconds before altering its course.  The new vector was south by southwest.  After altering course the object appeared to pick up speed rather quickly and began ascending.  The object was approximately 60 degrees above the horizon when I lost sight of it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I thought that was unusual experience and I turned my gaze back to the west. I noticed the second object was once again visible and appeared once again to be bright orange.  The object was still silent and had no running lights whatsoever.  Once the object re-appeared I tracked it’s flight path.  The object appeared to follow the identical flight path of the first object.  The object also had the exact same flight characteristics of the original object.  The second object appeared to slow down considerably, stop and then alter course.  The object stopped for approximately 10 seconds before altering its course.  The new vector was south by southwest.  After altering course the object appeared to pick up speed rather quickly and began ascending.  The object was approximately 60 degrees above the horizon when I lost sight of it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Unusual characteristics: I could not hear any sound coming from either object.  Both objects were a brilliant orange in color.  Almost like the color of orange sparkling off a diamond a deep fire like orange color.  I can’t say that I have ever seen this color before. Words fail to adequately describe the true color of the objects.<n> <n><n> <n><n> These objects did not have the characteristic blinking lights found on military and civilian aircraft.  When the objects appeared to stop it was as if they were floating effortlessly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have no idea what the objects were but the experience was very interesting.<n>

Approximately four discernible colors were observed, while rapidly darting south and west across the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Originating location, to be more precise, could be approximated somewhere between Commerce and Sulphur Springs on HWY 11.  The first object was stationary on the horizon from our location near the Lake Sulphur Springs public boat slip sitting on FM 2285.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Once observed for approximately fifteen minutes, the initial object appeared to wobble gently on it&#39;s axis, then began a pattern of moments, with extreme precision, positioning itself in a variety of geometric shapes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After reaching a stationary formation again, still in the same general location, the colors began pulsing between red, blue, and an indistinguishable yellow/white/orange glow.  The object shot northerly toward what I imagine is around Commerce.  At this moment two additional lights faded into view as if they were perhaps cloaked in the current position.  The three lights simultaneously and in succession appeared to resume formation with the primary object performing the same sort of initial choreographed maneuvers.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After two to three minutes one object faded out of view while the two others still danced in almost direct view of the soft glow of, again, what I suspect to be, the city of Commerce.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The additional two lights moved approximately thirty to fifty yards back and forth from their northerly position south, then back again.  After performing this maneuver for several moments, these two objects reached a fixed location and appeared to be pulsating. While fading in and out of the aforementioned color scheme, both objects together, dimmed and faded out of view.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Almost directly overhead, more northerly, a single light faded into view but appeared as an ethereal looking soft white ... Similar to a star, but discernible by the naked eye.  The object was travelling at a high rate of speed, heading from an approximated due north to the East, toward the Texarkana area.  Upon reaching this easterly position, two additional lights intercepted the object and took a triangular formation.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We all watched as these objects pulsed various lights, primarily red and blue, then upon settling on a fixed location, somewhere around three times the rate of speed most airplanes travel across the sky, either shoot out of visibility...  Upward...  Not toward the horizon, or disappeared out of view entirely.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Again visually scanning the northern sky, we saw what appeared to be a somewhat irregularly bright star. Hovering in a fixed position, glowing white, the object emanated a reddish orange glow then exhibited a red burst three to give times it&#39;s original size and disappeared from view.<n> <n><n> <n><n> These are frequent sightings for the three of us. We are healthy, educated, and responsible members of society.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Our child, family, and occasional family friends have also witnessed these baffling lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Typically, we have seen these lights first noticeable across our western horizon just after sunset, immediately following the colors of twilight fading to dark. Animals in the area will typically begin stirring, coyotes howl, dogs bark aggressively, birds and insects such as cicadas cease to make noise... all immediate prior to a sighting nearby. There have been well over ten obviously distinguishable lights sighted moving faster than any common aircraft, just tonight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> How this has not made the local news is beyond me.  I am former US Army Ranger, law enforcement, and definitely keen on protecting our anonymity.  Perhaps similarly security conscious individuals or those with a respect for their own public reputations viewing this type of anomaly can speak to the &#34;why&#34; of the matter.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Words, and especially our attempted video or photo documentation, do no justice to the events I am poorly attempting to describe.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Similar occurrences in this area (google search) are recorded as far back as the 1940s.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I hope that one day this may be of some benefit... to someone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Good luck.<n> <n><n> <n><n> K.<n>

I/We watch them from the &amp;quot;&amp;quot;first light&amp;quot;&amp;quot; around 9:00/9:30pm as they show up on the South/West direction from Olive Ave, and fly around.Some days they stay around the Buckeye area, some days they fly to the Goodyear area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have been watching these Orange Lights out West of Delta UT since 1993, and have watched them up to the week they disappeared from our area for 2 months before they showed up in Phoenix AZ and then called the  &amp;quot;&amp;quot;Phoenix Lights&amp;quot;&amp;quot; sighting in March 13, 1997. I have also watched them fly over Gilbert AZ when I was working on building the Loop 202 and US60 interchange. Same flight times, only a South/West small flight area over Gilbert AZ area. I have seen flairs from the military bases up in UT, and with the different yellow/orange glow from them, there is the tail tell sign of the smoke going up in the sky from the flairs. It&#39;s been 20yrs that I have been watching these Orange Lights, I keep My car full of gas at all times, so that one day I may be in a position to attempt to locate them. The closest I have come to them was when I was on My way home from work late one night (living in Buckeye AZ last year in the Blue Hills Sub) and heading South on Miller Rd just exit the I-10, and ther! e was a single Orange light due South of Me. I got as close as! getting to Southern Ave when the light turned off. I pulled in to the dirt lot to the West side of the road at Baseline Rd and turned off the car and got out to see if I can see or hear anything. Not a sound out there other than cars. I have watched them fly in the South from My yard in Buckeye AZ. I now live on Sun Valley Parkway just North of I-10 and in the first week of moving here, I have seen them Due South of My window.<n>

The lights on the bottom were dome shaped that were focused in a beam, not like a flashlight ... and  I couldn’t make out much except that the aircraft’s body was completely black, nearly at eye level from the bridge,  This thing was moving way too slow for it be a regular plane coming in for landing and it didn’t have any blinking lights, made no noise what so ever… Since I saw it at eye level the body of the craft seemed to be about 10-15 feet tall… IT looked just like the TR-3B or Aurora aircraft…  As I passed it I tried to keep my eyes on it, but I had to keep looking ahead so I didn’t crash while driving… I looked back and it was gone… It appeared to be landing at The St.pete-Clearwater international airport.<n>

She asked what they were, and I assumed they were gulls.  We stopped the car to watch them more carefully, because we noticed no wings were flapping.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They looked at first flat, which is why I assumed they were birds, but they were too high in the sky, and there was no wing-flapping at all.  They were moving, changing different formations, from four in a square, with three opposite, and sometimes triangles, and lines.  At this point, they appeared more round, and I thought maybe they were balloons.<n> <n><n> <n><n> However, at one point, one broke away from the other six, and flew northeast.  Then a few moments later, a second one did the same thing.  A third one seemed to begin to do this, but it stopped and stayed closer to the other four.  The remaining four continued to make different formations, mostly staying in a square pattern, and slowly moved in a NE direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then, the three that had broken away, began to come back, in a straight line, parallel to the four in a square formation, and they all moved NE.  Then they vanished.  This all happened in about a ten minute period.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When they were all together, we observed them flying past each other, back and forth, very closely--could not have been planes, nor balloons, nor birds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> No idea what these could have been.  They were very bright, white, and my daughter says she thought she saw black around the edges of them.<n>

A second or so later another orange orb “turned on” directly to the left of the first and in line with the first orb.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The first orb then “turned off” quickly followed by the second orb “turning off”.  About 3 seconds later orb one turns back on followed by orb two and then by a third orb.  At this point I am trying to concentrate on staying on the road while looking at the orbs; then, as suddenly as they turned on, they turned back off.  I noticed a road sign for a side road called Deter Ranch road, but was not able to find that road listed on any mapping programs like google maps.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Continuing driving north about 30 minutes later I notice the orbs switching on again.  They appeared in much the same sequence only this time there were four.  They remained illuminated approximately 10 to 15 seconds before switching off and I did not see them again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The way they “switched on” reminded me of the “Phoenix Lights” only I did not see any triangle shaped craft, only the lighted orbs.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

We had bought a constellation map at the nearby Greenbank Radio Telescope Center.  So, we were walking around the campground looking up at the sky trying to see these constellations.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After that, we went back to our camp, grabbed our toothbrushes and headed to the building that had the bathrooms and sinks.  As we were walking, something streaked across the sky.  It was chevron shaped, but was more rectangular and was longer.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My first thought was that it was a jet, but  it was flying far too low, and if it was we would have heard the engines, and it was dead silent.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My second thought was that it was a large bird, but that was quickly ruled out since it was huge, probably the size (length wise) of a plane.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We only noticed it because for a few seconds, it blocked out the stars with its shape (which was the only way I&#39;m able to describe its shape since there were no lights on it).<n> <n><n> <n><n> I still have no idea what it was, and my dad, who is the most logical and down-to-earth person I&#39;ve ever met, is still baffled and can&#39;t offer up an answer.<n>
6/26/13 22:00|Crawley (UK/England)||Diamond|30 seconds|Fleet of stealthy dark squares without lights, in formation and monitored by military helicopter|7/5/13|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/099/S99634.html|93|ndxe201306| Fleet of stealthy dark squares without lights, in formation and monitored by military helicopter<n> <n><n> <n><n> First noticed a military helicopter, most likely a Lynx, slim possibility of it being a Puma but not a Merlin due to its slender aft fuselage. Circling overhead at between 1,500ft - 2,000ft. Despite the time, being summer it was not dark but dusk and the silhouette of the helicopter was reasonably definable.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Within a minute or so, we noticed a fleet of 10-12 square-shaped dark craft flying silently in tight formation at no more than 1,500ft, in a South-Easterly direction. Due to the closeness of their formation, (that is that they were either overlapped or touching) at first glance I thought I was watching two massive birds of prey cruise overhead, however formation 1 converged into a diamond configuration and formation 2 opened-up with breathtaking precision. They had no lights and were obviously thin profiled as they appeared to disappear quickly as I chased after them across the green outside my home. They flew individually as diamonds not squares, i.e. across their corners. The closest known stealth aircraft to these would be the BAe Taranis, however there were no notches out of the rear section and I do not think for one moment that even if they had built so many of them, they would not be testing them over a busy town of 100k people, in such proximity to each other. The fl! ight characteristics were such that they would have knocked each other out of the sky. As for speed, they didn&#39;t hang about but could not have been doing much more than 350mph.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After this, the helicopter turned about and crossed the sky overhead in an easterly direction. The helicopter had 2 - 3 spot lights fitted to the aft of the main fuselage pointing straight out, not down but nothing at the front was on. It continued to circle overhead for some time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As well as being an aviation enthusiast, I live 10 minutes from Gatwick Airport directly under a helicopter corridor for both military and civilian craft. I often see Apache Longbows, Chinooks, MD 902s of the police and air ambulance (for whom I work) and Agusta executive helicopters. As a musician and sound engineer I can easily recognize the specific sounds of the aforementioned aircraft and identify them long before visual contact. So much so I can be outside with a video camera ready to film the Longbows as they come over as I can hear them approaching from miles away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It is important to stress that as the fleet of UFOs flew overhead the only noise that could be heard was that of the Lynx, which also sounds similar to the Puma at that altitude but quite different from a Merlin.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The helicopter sighting made this week&#39;s local newspaper wherein a former soldier believed it was a Chinook by its sound as he didn&#39;t see it and was clearly mistaken, since other non-qualified witnesses could see it only had one main rotor. Its presence was a mystery according to the paper as nobody else had witnessed the UFOs that the helicopter was clearly monitoring. It is quite possible that people may have been so distracted by the chopper, that they mistook the fleet of UFOs for birds and paid no attention. Fortunately, I have excellent vision. Too bad I could not get to my phone camera quick enough to capture the UFOs, though I did manage to record the lynx. The footage appears darker than it actually was but then a little cloud contributed to the quickening night sky.<n>

A pinkish reddish lighting lit up the sky afterwords....<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was traveling on route 8 coming from Naugatuck when I had seen the red light in the sky.  I ignored it for a bit because it was a starry night out, so my first impression was that it could be a planet, star, or airplane.  When I reached the beacon fall area, I got a better glimpse of the red light and stared at it for a while.  It started to move downwards pretty fast and then disappeared.  The two cars in front of me braked and slowed down as well because I can see both their heads starring to the right where the object was located.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Shortly after seeing the object vanish, a pinkish color shade of lighting lit up the sky with no sound of thunder.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was not intoxicated, high off any drugs, or on medication.  I and the other cars on the road noticed the light drop in the sky at the same time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A recent sighting of weird lights in the sky has appeared in Bristol, CT on June 22nd and was on the news.  This was my first time seeing something like this in person and i was slightly freaked out.  I don’t know what is going on lately, but weird things have been going in in CT.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

Lost power when it was hovering.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was a storm that had hit, a little bit of rain.  Anyways the power went out so a friend and I had gone outside on the balcony to see who else had lost power when we noticed an &amp;quot;orangey-red&amp;quot; sphere dipping down over Roslyn and then climbing back up again (something a plane would not do) then traveling up into the sky horizontally (something a plane would not do either).<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object appeared to be round, my friend said it looked like a fireball or something.  We noticed it a second time coming towards my apartment building, traveling East and it appeared to get darker as it traveled higher... from an orange color to a darker red.  As soon as the object had left the area, my Comcast (TV) signal then came on.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Anyways, I&#39;ve filmed it if anyone is interested. Couldn&#39;t get a solid photo of course.<n>
6/25/13 23:00|Redding|CT|Formation|all night|Cluster of lights and a plethora of abnormal activity over weeks, years.|7/3/13|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/099/S99022.html|108|ndxe201306| Cluster of lights and a plethora of abnormal activity over weeks, years<n> <n><n> <n><n> My family has been in Redding CT for generations.  My grandmother told me countless stories of her own that took place in that town.  Although I didn&#39;t have my own experiences until my mid twenties.  Near my house, the Saugatuck Reservoir stretches miles of road all the way down to Wilton CT.  Towards the end of high school, my friends and I would marvel at the lights that were over the woods and reservoir.  They would move in and out of the tree line at a place called devils den, then emerge in plain view to hover in groups, sometimes as many as six.  I remember seeing these lights constantly after we discovered them, as soon as it got dark they were always there.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I was 24, I moved back home for a couple months and totally forgot about the strange lights.  I never really knew what to make of them and don&#39;t believe in anything paranormal, so I dismissed them entirely.  Until one night when I was getting ready to watch a monday night football game with my friend and girlfriend.  I was placing an order for pizza on the phone, when my friend became fascinated with an on old dusty tin can loaded with change sitting on my shelf.  It had been there for years.  I looked at him, then at the can and noticed it was shaking and emitting almost a humming noise.  While I was placing the order on the phone, both him and my girlfriend got closer to the object and it got louder. Sure enough, my friend reached out to touch it and it flew across the room. Total elapsed time was about a minute.  Considering we were grown adults, we did not panic.  I kept saying it was a mouse or something, my friend kept joking that it was a ghost.  Needless to say, we coul! dn&#39;t do anything about it so we went to get our food.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When we got back, all of us began our ascent up the stairs when the door to my room suddenly opened seemingly for us. That spooked us down the stairs right away. I was the first to laugh, telling them that the door was most likely not properly closed and the motion of going up the old stair case jarred it free. My friend was adamant he saw the knob move, but I told him that has happened before and he calmed down. Old house, old door, no big deal. My friend stayed to eat, but left soon after claiming he was tired. About an hour later, I was lying on my bed watching the game, adjacent to a window that gave me a pretty good view of the sky. All of the sudden, a jet like object came into my peripheral. I looked over and saw it moving slowly, I was in the middle of pointing this object out to my girlfriend when it quickly went directly over my house, no more than 20 yards above the roof. Instantly, I ran outside and saw nothing. It was absolutely silent. I knew it couldn&#39;t have b! een a jet or helicopter, but I convinced myself it was.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The weeks after were strange. Doors kept opening, and I saw a figure constantly. The only way I can describe him was a silhouette of Abraham Lincoln. Tall, skinny and what looked like a top hat. I don&#39;t know what the hell that experIence was, but I moved out soon after that. My mother still lives in that house and started to tell me she has had experiences that she claims could only be &#39;ghosts&#39;, even though she never believed in that stuff just years ago.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have since moved away, first to Newtown in 2011 when I had a similar experience that I reported to this site. For reasons unrelated to this activity, I am now in PA. and have not experienced any new activity in two years.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I returned to visit my family for a couple days. I never made sense of those experiences, but years later, I remain curious. I went back to the spot where I remember seeing those lights all the time, and sure enough they were there. Hovering, moving back and forth between the woods of devils den and wilton.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was a very recent ufo report in wilton from dozens of residents that was reported in their police log. I have no idea what any of this stuff is or how it gets investigated, but I would tell any curious ufo hunter to go down to the Saugatuck reservoir in Redding on a clear night, for some reason I remember them being more animate on full moons, and watch the lights towards Wilton. A handful of times me and a friend saw them closer, below the tree line on Dayton road, the road alongside the entrance of devils den. Although I have been down that road many nights and the occurrence is rare. Try to make sense of it if you can, but I&#39;m glad to be far away from the area.<n>

The parts were shaped like equal parts of a solid cylindrical object, only longer and more narrow.  They resembled the slices of an orange, if you peeled it and pulled it apart along the natural separations.  The four parts then disappeared without smoke, noise, or any movement.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Previous to this event, my boyfriend witnessed the aforementioned orange light moving with great speed across the night sky.  At that point, he ran into the house to get my attention, and we both witnessed this orange light split into 4 objects.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am a 47 year old woman of mixed ancestry (African American, Indian, of the subcontinent, Scottish, and Native American, possibly of Cherokee origin.)

We witnessed a singular light high in the sky, virtually silent traveling from the nw to the se.  Not on the normal flight path to the south of us for ABIA.  It didn&#39;t do anything weird or crazy just an oddly bright star-like light.  Much brighter than a satellite and no blinking lights like a plane.  Within 10 to 15 minutes two jets of a fighter type came traveling from the se to the nw at varying altitudes almost retracing the lights path.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;m an OIF Army vet and my wife was a Navy MA, we both have experience with flight lines and various aircraft.  The star-like light seemed abnormal, the fighter craft did not.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then again on 06/25/13 we stepped outside and planted some chairs to watch. We again witness the star-like light to the east traveling in a more n to s flight path. Again abnormal without blinking lights nor any sound.  We again witnessed two regular type craft approximately 20 to 25 minutes later retracing the star-like lights path.  Too far away to tell if they were fighters or not, but had blinking lights as normal.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Going out again tomorrow and going to try to film it if able.<n>

I had to walk around the corner to keep track.  I ruled out a plane or a jet for 2 reasons, the first is it made no sound and the second was that most of the time a jet or plane appears white or silver against a blue sky.   This was a solid black dot, slightly larger that the period at the end of this sentence.  I watched it for a good solid minute, it just remained on the steady course and grew smaller until it was out of sight.<n>

About two balls on each leg of the triangle.  The bottom half of each styrofoam ball was covered in red and yellow LED lights.  About eight AA batteries were glued into each styrofoam ball.

I got ready for bed,  my wife was sleeping already, and I went outside to smoke a cigarette on my porch.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I sat down, not really paying attention to the sky, when all of a sudden out of the corner of my eye I saw what appeared to be a star moving.  I had seen these before but this time the sighting only lasted about 4 to 5 seconds.  The star got extremely bright, brighter than any star in the sky,  as it began to move from left to right and slightly downwards.  The light that was emitted was a bright white light, the same color as the stars.  As soon as it appeared it disappeared, losing all brightness and finally disappeared.  I waited about a minute with my camera phone handy in case it decided to reappear again but it never did.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;ve seen moving stars here in Puerto Rico before, about 4 to 5 times in a 4 year period  But I was always able to relocate the moving star and was able to follow its trajectory with the naked eye, observing them as they grew bright white and then faded out about every 15 seconds approximately, eventually losing track of them as they continued on their path.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This time though the bright white light was even brighter than the previous sightings of moving stars and the whole sighting only lasted about 4 to 5 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Afterwards,  I could not relocate the moving star again.<n>

I noticed the warm night air and full moon to my right and looked around enjoying the nice calm morning.  It was before daybreak and was still very dark.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Just then I noticed a peculiar light in the sky to my left that had come into view from over the treetops in that direction.  I expected this to be a small plane due to the low altitude of less than 1000 feet.  This is not uncommon for my area.  However, I then noticed the light from this object were of a solid tubular pattern and there were no blinking lights and absolutely no sound.  Low flying small airplanes and military helicopters are common sights near my home as are higher altitude commercial aircraft.  I have even seen the International Space Station in the sky before.  This light was from none of these.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I slowly walked toward my garage while observing the light object the whole way.  I stopped outside my garage and observed the object slowly moving across the sky.  I reached inside the garage to turn on the outside garage lights to alert the object that I was there. It slowly continued across the sky with no change in speed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I quickly went inside my garage to put the items I was holding in my car and went to grab my sunglasses to see if I could see more detail with them on.  I stepped out of my now open garage door to look back at the object and it was gone.  I could no longer find it anywhere in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am utterly confused by the object I saw this morning.  I am a very rational and logical thinking person. But I can not explain what I saw this morning. I checked out the International Space Station site to see the location of it. At the time it was over the South Pacific. What I saw was low flying and couldn&#39;t have been it or any other commercial aircraft.  I am completely stumped regarding what I saw this morning.<n>

I had my cruise control set at 60m.ph, radio turned off, and windows partially down.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Around the zorn avenue exit, right outside of downtown Louisville.  I noticed about a half a mile ahead of me and on the other side of the highway, a object above the tree line. (TREE LINE RUNS DOWN BOTH SIDES OF ENTIRE HIGHWAY)   My first thought was wow that helicopter, plane is flying low.  Thats when the cruise control came off and i slowed to around 45m.p.h.  The object started moving across the highway, at a northwestern fashion.  This object was about 200 feet above the ground, about the size of a mini van or large car, and made no noise.  What made me notice this object was the lights, it had a series of bright green and extremely vivid colored lights on the bottom or belly in a V shape or triangl! e.  With the green lights at the corners.  There was also one red light in the middle that pulsed slowly, almost like a heartbeat.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I watched this thing fly directly over top of my car.  Looking through my windshield and up over my steering wheel, i noticed the silouette only because of the close by downtown city lights.  The object had round edges   almost like a football but wider, that made up the entire craft.  It was really strange,  the whole time i couldn&#39;t see the object only the lights, but they were so bright i dont understand how they didnt light up any part of this object, they should have, but this was black or cloaked is best described.  I continued to watch as it flew over and past me above the tree line on my side of highway.  I was able to see this object from the front, from its side, and from its rear.  No other lights were on this object at all, and living by Louisville you know what planes, helicopters, commercial and even some military aircraft look an! d sound like.  F.A.A requires all aircraft to use a red light ! on one s ide or wing, a green on the other and a white flashing light at the rear.  This object had only  lights on the bottom, nowhere else.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is by far probably the strangest thing ive ever seen, and would really love to know what it was.   It wasnt a helicopter, it wasnt a plane, it wasnt a toy or R.c because it was too big, and think to myself would military be flying some drone or black ops over a highway with bright green lights, it doesnt make sense to me.  I hope someone else saw this thing because for right now im sleepin with my pistol close by.<n>

It was a clear night; I noticed a bright solid yellow/white light object coming out of the south.  I would estimate its altitude as 6 to 8 thousand feet &amp; traveling much faster than an airplane.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It had no conventional marker lights as a plane or helicopter would display &amp; there was no sound.  I would estimate it to be ½ to ¾ miles away at this point.  It made in less than 2 seconds a very rapid 90 degree turn to the west as it was passing to the west of me &amp; traveled due west for about a mile.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Suddenly it started a rapid decent showing no more forwards movement, came strait down &amp; below my line of sight into the tree line.  I noticed that its descent speed decreased, as it got closer to the ground<n> <n><n> <n><n> The light intensity was the same the entire time I viewed the object.  It was only about 30 seconds or less from the time  I noticed the object coming out of the south, at say 45 degrees over the horizon to the point I lost sight of it.  I watched for about five minuets &amp; saw no activity.  I then continued walking to my fishing site 10 minuets away to the west &amp; never did see it again; trees now blocked my view.<n>

6/24/13 22:00|Captiva|FL|Light|2 hours|I and a friend first saw 2 UFOs at her house, and when I got home a few minutes later I saw the same two, and then eventually 7.|7/14/13|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/099/S99795.html|130|ndxe201306| I and a friend first saw 2 UFOs at her house, and when I got home a few minutes later I saw the same two, and then eventually 7.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Long Duration UFO Sightings:  On June 24, 2013, I was at my friend “Carol’s” house on Sanibel Island – a barrier island just off the coast of Ft. Myers Florida, USA.   Her house is on Clam Bayou, toward the northern half of the island, and is about a half of a mile from the Gulf of Mexico.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What I herein describe is based on notes I had written up the next day after this initial sighting, and several days following, in addition to what “Carol” and a MUFON friend later told me what I was  describing to them, “blow by blow,” on the telephone for a total of just over 2 hours<n> <n><n> <n><n> At approximately 10:15 p.m., we were on the second floor balcony, which faces west and is about 20 feet above the ground and about 25 feet above sea level.  Our eye level was just under 26 feet above sea level.  We saw toward the west an amber light just “blink on.”  Then about 2 minutes later, another amber light came on to the right/north of the first one (see drawing).  These lights were about the size of a finger nail at arm&#39;s length, and they were about two fingers held together apart – they were horizontal to each other.  We could not make out any type of a craft, only the lights.  The lights were “solid,” which is to say that they were not like turn signal lights on a car.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The sky was heavily overcast and there was no moonlight.  It rained late that afternoon, but there was no drizzle when this was happening.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We watched the two lights drift together very slowly toward the north for 10 to 15 minutes at the most.  By approximately 10:25, they had drifted behind some trees in the bayou.  The trees are about 50 feet high at the most.  The lights were just below treetop level.  Carol and I both guess that the lights were no more than a few hundred feet above the water.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Shortly after we lost sight of the lights I drove exactly 2 miles (8 minutes) to where I live on Blind Pass, Captiva Island.  From a deck on the water behind my house I saw the same two lights again, just over the top of the railing on the south side of the bridge that connects the two islands.  My eye level on the deck is about 11 feet above sea level.  From my vantage point I estimate that the lights were two to no more than 500 hundred above the water; carol and I figured the same thing from her house.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Based on my second initial sighting over the south end of the bridge, I triangulated where the lights initially were using Google Earth.  The lights were 1.53 miles away from Carol’s house,. 2.16 miles from my house, and 1.03 miles out from the beach.  I can send “need to know” people my Google Map drawings provide they agree in writing not to disclose where I and “carol” live.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I called Carol shortly after I got home at 10: 41 to tell her what I was seeing, and stayed on the phone with her nonstop for an hour and 21 minutes.  I could not remember very well the next day exactly what I was telling her for such a long time; my memory is pretty poor to begin with, and the high anxiety I was experiencing likely compounded the problem.  In addition to that, I’m an early, early bird, and am usually asleep by 9 or 9:30, which may have affected my memory too.  Nonetheless, I saw what I saw and  Carol filled me in a lot on what I herein describe.  Unfortunately, carol, at 71 years of age, doesn’t have the best of memories either.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I watched what appeared to be the same two amber lights for a while before a third light, of the same color and intensity appeared to the right of the first two.  They remained pretty much stationary but individual ones seemed to change a bit in intensity.  After another while they started drifting slowly to the north (to my right, and also drifted a bit higher in the sky.  Then a forth, same-type light came on.  When the lights came on they came they did not just “switch” on, but came on more like turning on a light with a dimmer switch.  These lights were horizontal to each other, but I seem to remember that they were not in a perfectly straight line.  The lights continued to drift slowly to the north, but did seem to become a bit dimmer, so maybe they were moving further away from me and more drifted more to the northwest and out to sea.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After quite some time watching them from the deck on the water behind my house, I walked about 200 yards directly west of me to the beach.  I immediately saw the ones I’d seen on the bayside.  They were definitely very, very slowly drifting from the south of me to northwest (my left to right) and then just hung there for pretty much the rest of the time, about 20 to 25 degrees above the horizon.  I’d guess that they were no more than 3 or four miles away from me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then another two lights of the same color and intensity came on to the right of the existing ones, for a total of six.  I had a 6-volt flashlight with me and I started flashing them, and I clearly remember Carol yelling at me on the phone (and she remembers this clearly too) not to do that -  and she was very, very frightened for me.  Whether it was me flashing my light on and off or not, the lights DID go on and off, one or two at a time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then I started flashing an “SOS” at them – three long, three short, three long.  Although I did not get the same SOS back, the lights continued to go on and off.  Then a 7th one &amp;quot;came on&amp;quot; just a tad, maybe a finger-width at arms length, above the six, toward the middle, and it was a solid white but not overly bright, and just a tad brighter than the others, about the size of your thumb nail at arms length.  I then remember getting VERY frightened and started shaking and told Carol I was going back home, which I did, even though the lights were still there, hanging to the SSW off of where I was.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I left the beach the lights were still all together in a &amp;quot;group,&amp;quot; in a fairly straight line that was as wide as the fingertips on your d held just a tiny bit apart. It was overcast with no wind, and I never heard a sound from them.   At the time I remember thinking that they could not have been all that far way, and as I stated before, my initial sighting of them when I first got home from Carol’s my triangulation showed that they were just over two miles away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> During this time the grouping of the lights would change, but not a lot - I could never make out an actual craft, and don’t ask me why I never took a photo with my phone, or got my camera at home.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I got back home I could not see the lights over the bridge, so they had indeed drifted northward during this time.  Despite Carol telling me not to go back to the beach, the scientist in me just had to take one more look, as this was what I thought was a once in a lifetime opportunity.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I remember clearly that when I got back to the beach the lights were still there and in about the same place, but I swear on my mom’s grave that I saw a “being” standing on, or floating a tad above, the boulders that comprised the north jetty at Blind Pass.  The rocks were about 200 yards to the north of me and the figure was about ¼ of the way in from the end (see photos).  As best I can remember the figure was very tall – maybe 10 to 12 feet, and it was grayish, according to my very clear memory of it.  What is odd in my recollection of it, is that as a silhouette in front of an overcast sky that was light enough to easily see and differentiate between the Gulf, the rocks sky, it should have been black.  There was a definite head, kinda square-cut shoulders, and recalling it as I now write, it seems that it was wearing some kind of a robe, because of both the wideness of the figure from the shoulders going down to the rocks, and because I could not make out any legs, even ! thought I seem to have thought there should have been.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is where I really have no recall of exactly what happened next – it was just pass midnight, the latest I’d stayed up in probably 8 months due to back surgery and pain meds I have to take.  Carol told me the following day that I had described the figure to her (and that it was really, really scaring her), and that I had flashed my flashlight at it while telling here that “they were benevolent and that there was nothing to worry about.”  Just how in the world I ever came up with that is totally beyond me, because in my known-to-others belief, any aliens who are kidnapping and abusing us humans can’t be all that benevolent as many claim.  She then said that I said that I thought the figure was coming toward me, that I got really scared and hid in some bushes, and that I got lost somehow until I figured out where I was.  I was on the phone with her all the while (thank God), so I doubt I got abducted.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I do remember telling her (which she corroborated) that I had finally had had enough of what I was seeing and that I was going home to lock my doors and turn all my lights on, which I did.  Again, from my bayside vantage point I did not see any of the lights when I got home.  I hung up talking to carol at 12:13 a.m. according to my phone log.<n> <n><n> <n><n> For whatever reason, I went back outside behind my house on Blind pass at around 12:55 a.m., and saw the lights over top of the bridge again.  This time I called my MUFON friend “Tom” and woke him up to tell him that “honest to God Tom,” I am right now looking straight at some UFO’s.  Tom later told me that I was describing to him for 43 minutes pretty much what I had told Carol I was seeing – that I was going from the bayside to the beach and was flashing my flash light at the lights and that they seemed to be responding, and that I had again seen the bright white light come on for a while just above the amber lights.  Tom also said that toward the end I told him I was looking at the tall being on top of the jetty, and left the beach to come home just after that,  He said I sounded really frightened all the while I was talking to him.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Finally, I have to be perfectly honest and say that I had taken some extra pain medication that evening/night to deal with my back problems, and that they may very will have affected what I was saying on the phone to my friends, as my friend Tom suggested to me, but I do not believe that the pain meds effected my judgment in what I was seeing in any way.  Although I’m a marine biologist, I’m first and foremost a scientist.  As per the title of that UFO documentary, I know what I saw – and would be most willing to take a lie detector test or whatever.  I would love to go under hypnosis to find out what was really going on, especially with that figure on the jetty I saw – so if there is anyone out there who reads this report and is near the Ft. Myers FL area or who would like to come out to our beautiful little Island, just let me know.<n> <n><n> <n><n> NOTE – Since that Monday night, I and four other shark fishing friends had two UFO sightings of a different type of “craft,” and saw for about 15 minutes a very strange glow, about the shape and size of that last little bit of sun right before it dips below the horizon, just over the Gulf horizon (the horizon is 7 miles out, and we figured the light was emanating from 10+miles out).  We all figured that whatever was producing the light had to be absolutely huge (following Wednesday night starting at 9 pm).  We had two other sightings that night, and I had sightings of other types of UFO’s the following four nights.  Since that time it’s been raining just about nonstop.  I will write up the other reports as soon as time allows, and will submit them too.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Quick update:  I saw the same two amber UFO’s described above (or something almost exactly the same), plus an orange-red one, approximately 6 to 7 miles due north of where Carol and I saw the other ones (no, they were not fireworks).  Report coming soon.  The time frame of all of these sightings so far is about the same – from just as the sky is getting totally dark, to 10 to 10:30 p.m.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Follow up reports:  Wednesday 5/26/13  Sighting #1 - I and four other shark fishing friends were on the beach on the south end of Captiva Island, FL, close to the rock jetty on Blind Pass.  At 9:10 p.m., with just a little bit of light left in the sky, we saw an off-white light traveling from north to south (traveling from our right, facing the gulf of Mexico, to our left).  The object was about the size of Venus when it is full, but much dimmer, and was about 60 degrees above the horizon over the Gulf of Mexico.  It was traveling about two times the speed of a jet liner, but was only about 3/5ths the height.  It was not a satellite, which I’ve seen at least 100 of.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We first saw it to the north, about 35 degrees to the right of us.  It took about a minute or so to reach straight out in front of us, and which point it started going on and off, but not in a strobe fashion.  Each on-and-off took about one half a second.  It took another minute or so reach the same degree south of us as it was to the north of us, when it just blinked out.  I was watching it through 10X42 binoculars and it appeared a little bit orangish.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Sighting # 2 -  near the had two UFO sightings of a different type of “craft,” and saw for about 15 minutes a very strange glow, about the shape and size of that last little bit of sun right before it dips below the horizon, just over the Gulf horizon (the horizon is 7 miles out, and we figured the light was emanating from 10+miles out).  We all figured that whatever was producing the light had to be absolutely huge (following Wednesday night starting at 9 pm).<n>

See the beautiful sunrise want their pictures taken. Pick up the phone press the shutter, took first that the images of strange, intuitive and immediately press the second shutter.  Then check the photos just found the first photo of the foreign body, turned out to be very clear UFO, immediately check the second photo finch does not have any UFO sightings.  Looked also did not see any trace of the air, and then they shoot the two did not continue to take a flying saucer.  Frankly when we see the photos when the whole family are shocked and disbelief.  The first time would have to say to reporters,<n> <n><n> <n><n> After some discussion, however, we are only looking for a credible and professional bodies, test and confirm that our photos are real, then leave our descendants.  Maybe because we are convinced that aliens in our neighborhood a place to rest, and I myself have twice in the same place, suspected UFO seen flying objects as well as points of light hovering in the vicinity, so I hope to keep this place let them rest, do not want our neighborhood to become tourist attractions.   So we hope to be able to open this conditional photos, we are willing to provide detailed information through the mail to you identification and analysis, but we do not want to be publicly detailed locations to the public, because, in my neighborhood, but also want to protect this place,  We are willing to provide photos to our users agree, but we will retain the photo&#39;s copyright.

Which was South/Southwest of my location.   When taking notice of its possible size another appeared just right of the first and lower in the horizon both making no movement in relation to the buildings or each other.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Details I could not make out except for the intensity of the glow considering it was over cast.  And unfortunately I had left my personal cell phone in the Security office on the main level on this particular patrol of the Parkade.  This entire event lasted only from beginning to end 20-25 seconds before both objects just winked out and never reappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> If you wish too Google map this I was located on the 700 block of Johnson Street Victoria B.C.  The Parkade is roughly 45 to 50 feet in height from street level from the top deck in which I observed this event.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Side note all night I had felt that they were still there.<n>

Moving only slightly.  I opened the door while still looking at the flame and told my boyfriend to come look at this thing in the sky.  I looked in at him and said, &amp;quot;Come look!&amp;quot;.   He came over and looked at the flame in the sky and said, &amp;quot;We should take pictures of this.&amp;quot;.  So, I went in the house and grabbed my iPod.  Came back outside and the flame had flown up higher in the pitch black sky.  I took a picture of the object.  Then, I decided to take a video. I could still see the object in the sky clearly with my eyes.  However, in the video it just looks like a small red dot. I watched it go straight up into the sky and then head directly towards the moon.  In my photo the object looks white and L or V shaped.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As for your request: The FAA said the wind velocity for my location last night at 11:26 p.m. was &amp;quot;I can&#39;t help you with that, Call the weather people.&amp;quot; So, I called the NOAA and for Wind Velocity for my location at 11:26 p.m. last night and they said, &amp;quot;about 5 miles per hour&amp;quot;.<n> <n><n> <n><n> He was rather rude.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was looking up into the sky in a South East Direction at the 120 mark on a compass.<n>

6/23/13 22:55|Colorado Springs|CO|Light|3 minutes|Slowly and evenly pulsing light that alternated between invisible and extremely bright as it travelled North.|7/3/13|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/098/S98878.html|142|ndxe201306| Slowly and evenly pulsing light that alternated between invisible and extremely bright as it travelled North.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was sitting on my deck at about 2255 using my iPad when, out of my peripheral vision, I noticed what looked like an extremely bright meteor, gradually increasing in brightness to the Southwest of my location (about 260-270 degrees azimuth).  It was about 45 degrees elevation, fairly close to Saturn.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I watched the object, it slowly decreased in brightness until it was invisible.  I thought, that&#39;s cool, I just saw a meteor that must have been headed straight towards me because it left no trail at all.  Then less than a minute later, it showed up again a little farther North.  But this time I watched as it gradually and evenly increased from invisible to a tiny pinprick of light, then to it&#39;s full brightness and back again to invisible.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At this point, I ran inside to get my fiancee to come outside to witness it.  I told her to look up to where I guessed it would show up again, and sure enough, after about 10 seconds, it appeared again - exactly like the previous two times.  I had her run inside to get my binoculars, and while she was gone, it appeared one last time before it disappeared from view.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At its maximum brightness, the object was much brighter than any object in the sky - brighter even than Jupiter at its maximum brightest.  The object appeared to be travelling  North from around Saturn towards Ursa Major and was completely silent.  Also, it seemed to be travelling significantly higher and/or slower than commercial airplanes normally fly.  The color of the light was always brilliant white when visible.  Finally, the object spent more time invisible than visible as it was travelling.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;ve seen countless planes and helicopters around here (a couple miles Southeast of the US Air Force Academy) and have never seen one that had lights like this object.  I&#39;ve seen satellites as well and this object appeared much, much brighter than any satellite I&#39;ve ever observed.  The entire sighting lasted for about 3 minutes.<n>
6/23/13 22:30|Roxboro|NC|Triangle|20 seconds|Triangular craft flying under 1000 ft and under 100mph RED LIGHT AT CENTER|7/3/13|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/098/S98964.html|143|ndxe201306| Triangular craft flying under 1000 ft and under 100mph RED LIGHT AT CENTER<n> <n><n> <n><n> I live in rural NC and do not live near an airport and although there is a military outfit in the area there is not a base I am aware of.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A few nights back I stepped out per usual to have a cigarette before retiring for the night.  It was roughly between 10:30 and 11 pm.  This night in particular was nothing out of the norm.  My mother joined me moments later for a smoke and we talked while gazing at stars and hunting satellites.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We hadn&#39;t been out long when we heard what sounded to be a very distant jet engine but became a low rumbling roar and I could feel the vibrations as I stood gazing skyward.  The UFO appeared mere moments later and was due south from my position and flew West to East.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The craft was approximately no more than half a mile away and was easily bigger than my house and seemed to defy gravity by moving so slow.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The event lasted no more than 20 seconds as the object soon disappeared behind the trees but I saw two very large yellow/white lights ! (one on the crafts nose, the other on the left wing) and at what looked to be at the heart of the ship was a large red light and the three said lights gave of a unwavering glow.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I assume that the right wing would also have had a yellow/white light and this vehicle matches several descriptions I have read previously.  My mother saw less of the craft than I did but she is still astute that it was unnatural.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I felt compelled to post this as this is my second encounter with an UFO. Less than ten years ago, and not but roughly ten miles from where I currently reside, a very slow and low flying, triangular craft black in color flew over my house and my family and I assumed it was a B-2 spirit but there were supposedly only 20 made.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The craft from that summer night in my youth had many lights on the bottom and was only a couple hundred feet over the tree tops.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A B-2 bomber&#39;s slowest flying speed is 140, right? It took until I was older to realize that what had flown over that night was flying well under 100mph because the tree tops only swayed mildly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

And then it was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Observations.  A mechanical sounding noise very different from an airplane.  A low pitched whum whum whum kind of really regular mechanical sound.  UFO was above a tall tree line.  But below the cloud level.<n> <n><n> <n><n> UFO flashed one light at the front, de-cloaked for only 5 seconds, then flashed the back light which allowed me to SEE the slow horizontal movement of the machine.

It was slightly moving N-NW , then stopped for about 45sec, then traveled SE, then changed direction instantly moving NNW again,  it was at an unknown distance, but no more than a mile or two away at a 45 degree angle. It’s orange red color was steady for about 3 minutes while traveling NNW, then became a little dimmer as it changed direction south, then dimmed and resembled a star for a minute and was stationary, then became even brighter and began traveling NNW again. But not as fast as it was originally for about 2 minutes.  The light then dimmed and resembled a star for about 3 minutes, then disappeared entirely.  My home is directly above the landing path for Barksdale AFB, and being prior military and having B-52s and all kinds of other planes flying and approaching at all times of the day and night I a certain this was not a plane or jet. There is no jet engine or strobe light in the world that can put out the light we saw, or move and hover like this.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My wife and I had our suspicions about the UFO, but on my way to work the next morning the local radio station KVKI DJ was talking all morning abouta UFO that approached Barksdale AFB airspace, the tower hailed it 3 times to no avail and dispatched fighters. Who knows what they saw, but this area, particularly the AFB has had numerous sightings over the past few years &amp; with the base housing half of our nuclear bombs &amp; missiles, why not come check it out?<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have seen some weird things in my life in thesky as I work outside in remote locations, but nothing like this before.

It was 7pm (Approx) and still daylight.  The shine reminded me of the shine on christmas timsel.<n>

It was the night the moon was supposed to be huge, so I wanted to take pictures of it since it looked no different to me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> While I took the pictures and the flash came on, I notices a strange line of lights flying through the sky!  I took a couple more pictures within the same minute or 2 and two more appeared at ones.  I looked at my husband and asked if he saw that.  I tried to convince myself they were shooting starts but he insisted they weren&#39;t we looked and zoomed in on the pictures and all three objects had 8 lights (almost like eight light bulbs) lined up in a straight line but the actual figure was on an angle.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It could not have been shooting stars.  Not looking like that.  After that, they disappeared.  It was very quick.<n>

I quickly remembered there were no visible stars as my wife and I had discussed earlier in the evening when we were wondering what our chances of seeing the Supermoon were going to be (which were zero in our neighborhood of Portland; it was simply too cloudy).<n> <n><n> <n><n> So, I do a double-take, get up from the couch and walk to the window to look out to the northwest at these four orange-ish red lights seemingly hovering in the sky.  I say to my wife, “Are those...what are those? Come here!” By the time she gets to the window one of them has moved higher and disappeared, so there are only three lights left. They hovered in the sky, eventually moved up over the next 90 seconds or so and then disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> These were not planes or stars. Shortly after the lights disappeared a plane was flying rather close to the horizon heading east, and it was clearly a plane with flashing lights.  The previous four lights were not blinking or flashing and moved up out of sight, not to the left or right.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I don&#39;t know what they were but they were certainly unlike any flying object I&#39;ve ever seen!<n>

Every time I went to a different location, the craft was still following me, staying still when I didn&#39;t move.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I put on some glasses, looked closer, and realized that it wasn&#39;t just a single star (there weren&#39;t any stars), but rather an actual spacecraft, with a red light on bottom and a green bluish one on top.  It looked unusual, but kind of ovalish with 2 tiny things on its dies.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It couldn&#39;t have been a plane, for they can&#39;t be totally still, and jets couldn&#39;t possibly stop or they would stall and crash.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am a creative person, and very intelligent.

The resort has two 18-hole golf courses and we went for a ride for about an hour enjoying the full moon, beautiful water on the golf courses and the views of the shores of the Chesapeake Bay.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were hoping to see the Strawberry Moon and noticed the area was very quiet except for the frogs and pond and forest creatures that were quite loud.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After about an hour, our golf cart ran out of its electrical charge leaving us stranded near the clubhouse.  Without cell phones we went to the clubhouse, now closed, at about 10:20pm and asked to use the phone to call my husband or daughter who were at our beach home.  When neither answered, we decided to walk home, about 2 miles.  The evening was beautiful and it was extremely quiet as we headed towards home.  We only passed 2 cars, both police vehicles and 4 people as we walked.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We crossed over Mason Avenue into the small town of Cape Charles from the golf area and headed north on Nectarine Street passing the Catholic Church on our left and commenting that the lights were on.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At that moment we heard a rumble of thunder and started to laugh about how not only had we ran out of the charge on our golf cart and had to walk home, but now we were about to get rained upon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We walked another block and turned right onto Madison Avenue.  At the corner of Nectarine Street and Madison Avenue my sister noticed lights in the sky that were “shaped like a rollercoaster.”<n> <n><n> <n><n> She asked me what I thought they were and I said “Fireworks?” “Well maybe they are planes from Norfolk- they have a military base there.”  I did not see those lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At this point we heard a second rumble of thunder. I quickly looked up and saw 12 distinct orangeish-yellow glowing lights in a perfect line.  The spacing between them was perfect and they appeared to be moving as one, towards us as if to land together.  They were hovering and completely silent.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We all started to run towards them and truly were captivated and curious, not at all frightened.   At this time I felt like I was running in slow motion.  We did not take our eyes off the sky for the entire duration.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The pattern slowly changed into one perfect circle, and then within a couple of seconds two flying saucer shaped objects, almost as if half the lights formed one object and the other half formed the second.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The objects still were soundless and hovering but the lights were dimmed and I saw what looked like the outline of a flying saucer.  In fact I said, “Oh my God, it’s a flying saucer”, with my eyes focused on the one on the right.  We continued to run until we reached Fig Street during which time the lights changed again, this time into 4 groups of three lights each perfectly shaped into the outline of a triangle.  The lights were glowing and light yellowish orange but very clear and distinct to easily see with the naked eye.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The objects changed again into 4 groups of three lights but this time four straight lines of three lights, all in a straight row with perfect spacing in between.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At this point, wanting to get a better look, we ran about 30 yards north on Fig Street towards our neighborhood and stopped at a house with a clearing and watched as each light slowly faded and disappeared in a random pattern with one remaining that flickered on and off two or three times.  At that point we noticed the rosy glow around the moon, which we thought was the Strawberry Moon, we were looking for.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The sighting took place over a thick grove of trees, which has a large field behind it, close to Route 13 North.  During the entire experience one truck passed us and we saw no one.  The entire experience seemed to last longer than the likely 7-8 minutes and I felt like everything was in slow motion.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I think the sighting was from about 10:47pm-10:55pm  We arrived back home at 11:17pm to find my husband and daughter sleeping.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We got in the car and drove straight to the police station and pounded on the door hoping they could explain what we had seen and also wondering if anyone else had reported it.  No one answered the door.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We then looked up UFO sightings and found your website and called in a report.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The next morning my husband drove with me to the police station and again no one answered the door.   We also drove near the forest of trees and the field behind it to see if anything was there and there was nothing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have never witnessed anything like this before and am uneducated and uninformed about UFO’s and sightings like this.  Besides ET, I’ve never watched a movie about UFO’s. I would very much like to have an explanation or help understanding what we witnessed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My 13-year-old niece thought another country was invading or attacking us.  I thought perhaps there was some sort of secret mission involving our military and my sister was certain of what she saw and had no explanation.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The perfect symmetry of the lights, the formations of the shapes and the silence of the experience was startling as was my emotional response of utter intrigue rather than fear or anxiety.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What started out as a light-hearted golf cart ride in the moonlight ended up as a rare and somewhat unsettling experience.<n>

I was somewhat taken back by what i was witnessing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They appeared at the south horizon just above a tree line.  They traveled at what seemed to be a slow rate of speed northeast toward an almost full moon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They then began to dissapear individually about fifteen seconds after they appeared to me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> These objects did not move in an abrupt fashion or shift in any way but in a linear motion.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This account took place as i was sitting om my girlfriends front porch patio.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;m an avid star gazer so naturally i was staring at the sky while my girlfriend went inside to grab her sons overnight bag for him. His grandfather was sitting in his truck in the driveway facing north bound. I  noticed the objects and stood up to get a better look at the event and in awe just pointed at the sky, speechless! As the group shaped in the v pattern began to dissapear Missy, my girlfriend walked out of the front door onto the patio. She noticed me pointing at the sky and cuaght sight of the two objects that followed. They then began to fade into the night sky. At first i thought that they had dissapeared behind cloud cover but after further investigation i realized the sky was very clear with no visible clouds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Im not sure what i witnessed but i can tell you that ive never seen anything like it before in my life. After discussing the event with Missy i decided to notify someone of the event. I tried to figure out a logical explanation for what i had seen but was unable to. I  wanted so badly to find out if others had seen the same thing so when i woke up the following morning after a restless night of sleeping i immeditely looked in the paper and browsed the internet for other sightings. I then chose to call the National UFO sighting hotline. I truley hope that others will come forward and tell there stories of the same event if they witnessed this unexplained event. Im willing to testify to what i seen.<n>

It was a somewhat cloudy night, the moon was only visible on and off. At that point I was at the coordinates +40° 24&#39; 17.18&#34;, -86° 52&#39; 46.19&#34;.  I kept driving, and the lights seemed to be moving north. I eventually stopped and got out of the car.  I didn&#39;t hear any noise in the direction of these lights, and they soon disappeared from view behind trees.  At that time they seemed to be moving north-east. It seemed to me that the 3 lights were from 3 individual crafts.  Unfortunately I didn&#39;t have a camera with me that day.  It is difficult to estimate how high these objects were in the sky or how fast they were really moving.  They could have been as low as 300ft moving slowly, and as high as 3000ft, moving faster.<n>

The night was relatively cloudless and nothing blocked the view of the moon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I noticed what I considered at the time a fast moving airplane which came into vision to the east of the moon as it cleared the roof of my house.  I was facing South and standing on my driveway.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It seemed like it was at a very high altitude and did not have any blinking lights.  It was a white light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Normally all the airplanes I see travel at a consistent speed across the entire sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This light then seemed to quickly gain altitude until it disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I’ve never seen an airplane or jet do this.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My wife was inside the house and I was telling her about the craft.  By the time she came outside it had disappeared.  The entire event was only 3-4 minutes.<n>

Object then turned to the East and continued flying at a fast clip.  Through Binocs it appeared to be an orange, oblong object with a glowing halo.  Object was about the size of an oval dime.  While watching through the binocs it moved as if under definite control.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then suddenly got very small then was gone!  There was no vapor trail of any kind nor was there any visible smoke.  There was nothing remaining when it disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was nothing glowing within (like a Japanese lantern) and also there was no breeze that could move a non powered craft at such a high rate of speed.  No wind at surface and very slight wind aloft was witnessed.<n>

The fireworks had just ended and my three children, mother and I were walking back to our car along with the hundreds of other spectators. I happened to look up and I saw a glowing yellow light in the sky at about helicopter height.  It was hovering above and to the northeast of us, moving slightly west. It made no sound.  The light was oval shape and a bright yellow like a the color of a traffic light.  It mostly held its shape, but every so often a flicker would come out of it at random intervals and at random places close to the main body, like a flame. It appeared to be roughly the size of a helicopter, but taller. When I looked I could see a cone made of the same yellow light coming out from the top, shaped like a bullhorn, the narrow part attached to the main body and the opening toward us.  The cone, though it shone as if it were made out of light, ended in a sharp line and was about 1/3 the length of the body of the main craft.  This cone swept the area as if in surveillance once, twice, then disappeared, so that only the main oval was visible.  The object then moved slightly faster, continuing to the west, maintaining the same height.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I watched the light until it was quite far west, but then continued walking back to the car.  Many spectators in the area saw it too and commented on how extremely unusual it was, and no one could place what it could possibly be.<n>

It was a round fiery glowing sphere with red, orange light that seemed to undulate as a fire would but within this circular object.  We noticed it slowly moving seemingly toward us in an angled, upward  direction.  There wasn&#39;t any audible sound at all.  We all went out on our lawn, and,  as we watched it was right over us at this point.  Not sure how high it was, but the size was approximately the same as my thumb nail at arms length.  At this point it continued to slowly ascend upwards no longer at an angle.  We watched it became smaller and smaller until it was no longer in sight.<n>

Then I saw a light high in the sky appear out of nowhere.  And right afterwards, like 2 seconds, another one appeared.  And then I called my Mom and my brother and told them to get their phones and then another one appeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We didn’t get our phones in time and then as they went into the distance, they vanished – disappeared.  But they flickered out before completely disappearing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A little while later, from the opposite direction from where the other ones came from, a smaller white one fly over and I didn’t see it vanish but it flew past where we could see (buildings got in the way).<n> <n><n> <n><n> The first three were a bright orange, They were circular with a big circle of light on the inside.  The smaller circle in the middle gave off the most light.  (My Mom describes them as bright arcs with a very bright middle circular light in the middle.)  After the first 4 passed, we all went inside thinking no more would come.  But then my Mom reminded me to finish the chore I went out there for, I went and saw that two more appeared out of nowhere as they did before.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So, I ran inside and got my phone and took a video of what I saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This happened around 9:33pm on Saturday, June 23rd, 2013.  Oh, and our upstairs neighbor saw the same lights while coming home from the store earlier than we did.  Then he caught the tail end of what we saw when he went into his apartment upstairs.<n>

Then we realized that it appeared much too large at such a distance to be a lantern.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We observed it for close to a minute when I decided to take a photo.  At that point the “fire ball” slipped into the forest surrounding the harbor.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It wasn’t a “ball” it was oval in shape.  The oval was upright as it glided above the harbor.  There was no apparent fire, nor no fire reported as a result of this “fire ball” entering a highly forested area.<n>

We had been outside for quite a while. I noticed a light(no color) in the sky flying from West to East.  I watched it closely because it was not flashing like an airplane or helicopter.  As it got closer we noticed there was no motor sound coming from this object.  It was completely silent.  It was about the size of a Cessna although judging size is very difficult.  As it passed over our heads and headed farther East it seemed to move a little bit out of its flight pattern and then the light on this object slowly dimmed and went out and we were just standing there puzzled wondering where it went?  I have seen this same thing in the past but never reported it.  This time it has forced me to report it.  We have also seen formations with about eight craft just white lights flying over our our city moving very slow, no flashing.<n>

This happened very quickly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I looked up I saw this circular shaped thing just appear out of a cloud and it did it very fast cause it kind of pulled the cloud out with it?  It must have been flying through it and the cloud kinda followed it.  Best way I can put it, it stopped on a dime.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It sat there for about five seconds or so and then it must have either vanished or flew away really fast cause it kinda went poof.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This happened in seconds so I just sat there kind of dumbfounded.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Whatever it was, was round, must have been big due to the height of the clouds and was about the same color as the clouds around it.<n>

We live in the mountains of southeast KY in Harlan County.  On June 22 at approximately 3 or 4 in the afternoon, my parents were sitting on the front porch when my father asked, “What is that thing?” My mother looked to where my father was staring to see a silver round ball with wings, ascending down the side of the mountain.  According to my father, the ball had come from a southwesterly direction over a place where the mountain “dips,” for lack of a better word, and descended at an angle into the valley.  It stopped just as it reached the top of a utility pole that runs adjacent to the railroad lines that come from the coal mines and extend through our hollow.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I inquired how the wings were shaped, I assumed they were like the fins on a rocket.  However, when I drew it for my mother, she corrected me, telling me the wings were more “bat-shaped” and coming from the sides at an angle, as though they were very slightly “pinned back” on the silver ball.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There is a lane with houses on the other side of the tracks, and my mother stated that the ball was about the same size as the cars parked at the houses on the other side of the tracks.  Once the ball reached the utility pole, it continued to travel in a northerly direction, following the utility line, out of the hollow.<n>

Top two fire orange with moving outer shell . One pretended to be part of satellite tower.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Looking southwest over wooded wetland area by my house l saw three circular objects through my night vision glasses.  As is routine I removed the glasses to check is they were visible without IR.  The top two were orange which appeared to me to be roiling like; that is having intense internal movement with spiky protections of same red - orange material, the lowest one was not visible with naked eye was that vacant sort of luminescence. I moved into a position down my driveway and closer towards objects, at this point I have no reference to mark height or distance.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Sitting on ground looking still southwesterly paying for the first time attention to the clouds and noticed two huge thunderheads coming in towards us  they were barely noticeable with naked eye but through night vision they were full of electricity .  Following  the objects one of the orange and the lower one disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The remaining orange object or so it seemed to me put itself over a satellite tower about a mile away same direction  southwest . As I saw it, it was almost pretending it was the lowest light on the tower for perhaps three minutes. Then all the lights were the their proper color white no more orange balls afire! Meanwhile I was fascinated with the huge amount of electricity in the clouds and I suppose I was trying to logically figure out if there was a connection I have never seen ball lightening and don&#39;t even know if it comes by Chicago.  Around the flashes in the clouds appeared other objects .  Whiter than white funnel shapes spinning into discs whiz away from the left thunderhead clearly distinctly having an independent visable ( life?) of their own.  I saw two perhaps three of these and then horizontal white flashes emanating from the clouds.   Yes we had a large downpour early morning. Yes also this was weird.  Will keep you posted.<n>

I live in loganville ,ga.  The sky is always full of planes etc. I am sitting on my back porch watching tv...( don&#39;t blow me off for this part ) I have had a couple ,3 beers..  Relaxing after work.  I have never in my life seen anything in the sky that doesn&#39;t fit there.....until tonite...<n> <n><n> <n><n> Not a believer, or nut case about extraterrestrial visitors etc. but the whole idea of so many stars etc, how can we be the only planet to have life etc.... I don&#39;t know but I am leaning way towards thinking there is something to this.....I stepped outside into the grass off the patio, and saw a white orange orb shape moving south almost parallel with rose pointe drive , to the east.  The color at first made me think it might be a firework or something...as it passed behind the trees on the back yard I got that it was wrong because there was no arch....and it seemed to be moving too fast at a too high altitude....  I quickly moved a half dozen stepps into the yard to see it come out from behind the trees...  And I was sure this was all wrong ,to all I know ...  It continued at a great speed level and right until it disappeared.  My cell phone battery is the only reason I didn&#39;t call 911.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am sure beyond any doubt this object what ever it was...  Is beyond the technology I understand we have today.<n>

In the western sky my boyfriend and I saw an orange yellow light approach from the direction of Mactaquac.  We thought it was a plane at first, but it went up into the clouds and as it got closer it was glowing like a fireball.  After it cleared the clouds the light went out and it turned black but we could still see the object because the moon was almost full so the sky was lit up well and there was still light on the horizon from the sunset.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We watched what now looked like a black blob go across the sky and head down river toward the center of the city of Fredericton, then it disappeared.  About 10 minutes later another orange yellow light approached again from the same westerly direction, went up into the clouds and hovered then the lights went out and it slow descended down to the  ground and out of sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then about 10 minutes after that in the eastern sky, closer to the city we saw two fireballs go across the river and they were quite low, lower than the other 2 sightings, and too low to be planes.  They were heading from a northerly direction toward the south and then as they crossed the river, the lights went out and they disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My boyfriend was able to get a photo of these two fireballs because they were closer and at a lower height.  When you increase the size of the image, it looks like two oval shaped fireballs and they were definitely not planes. These objects made no sounds either.<n>

The moonlight made it clear to me that it was triangular shaped.  The lights I first saw, were actually three lights one being on each corner of the craft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After I recognized what I was witnessing my instinct was to get closer to it, when I increased my speed I watched it go from just hovering to leaving the atmosphere with incredible speed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is my second time reporting this in the same area.<n>

6/21/13 22:00|El Cajon|CA|Triangle|15 minutes|21 June 2013 low altitude aerial contact in triangle shape, shifting colors from port & starboard side with 0 noise(trained lookout)USN|7/3/13|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/098/S98808.html|231|ndxe201306| 21 June 2013 low altitude aerial contact in triangle shape, shifting colors from port &amp; starboard side with 0 noise(trained lookout)USN<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;m sure of what i saw and described it on the phone exactly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is my honest report on what i saw and will not reveal any personal info about myself.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On the 21st of june 2013 in el cajon, CA i was talking on the phone to someone outside smoking a cigarette and then i saw a bright white light over the hill come up abruptly then i noticed it was coming straight towards me in a residential district when it was flying low so i walked closer and interrupted the conversation to let the other person on the line know what i was seeing.  The light got closer and closer and was completely silent and had 1 main light in the middle and when it was coming towards me i saw lights shift from port(left) to starboard(right) and back and forth.  The lights changed colors and moved from both sides, port and starboard of the craft.  I&#39;ve been in the navy as a logistics specialist (LS) and am a trained lookout for surface and aerial contacts on a ship and have seen many lights at a distance of nautical miles in open sea and in other countries and have nev! er seen an aircraft anything like this.  The person on the line was totally freaked out by what i was describing and i was totally interested in what was going on.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I would have been a lot more concerned if it stopped right over me, but instead it kept moving circling the city changing lights as if it appeared to be a plane at a distance but it was about 500 yards above me.  I&#39;m used to giving locations of contacts off the port bow, so i would say that if when i was looking at it, it came up at 00 degrees or my centerline and moved in a circle at my centerline then zig zagged slowly moving to my port side up and over slightly to the left of me moving 2, then 2.5, then 3, then 4 points off the port bow (as if i was locating it on the ship with MSC-Military Sealift Command type navigation as my ship was crewed as part navy and part MSC)(wont give name or country) and kept moving eventually out of sight.  Then a low flying plane flew right over me about 5 mins after the event and ! i could clearly see the difference. Not to mention my phone so! unded like it was staticy like i was being listened to.  I wouldn&#39;t be surprised because it was a non-secure line.  The thing is we never see anything flying low at 2200 at night in a residential area as i go out a lot to smoke a cigarette.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I know that this is not that detailed, but it was very detailed on the phone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My phone couldn&#39;t zoom in to take pics, but for whatever its worth i wanted to let people know i&#39;m a credible veteran who was honorably discharged 2 months ago to go to college and i saw this right outside the house and didn&#39;t know what else to do but write it down. I just googled how to report ufo and here i am. A drone would have made noise, even if it were a static noise. We need full disclosure and we need it now more than ever with the protests around the world because we see all the lies and secrecy.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Very Respectfully, 								Anonymous naval veteran<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

Partly cloudy skies but the moon was very bright.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They were only one color (orange) and very easy to notice,  although they were a dull orange so to speak, they were very easy to see and follow.  Cannot tell how big they were or how high they were flying but I’m assuming they were below the cloud line at least for a little while.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They were not in any particular pattern that I could see from my vantage point but seemed grouped pretty tightly but I was driving and lost them behind trees every once in a while.   Some were grouped closer together and some seemed to be lagging behind and strung out at the tail end.  All of them seemed to be flying in the same direction following the exact same trajectory and not spread out  to wide.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I heard no noise, I would think from a fleet of airplanes or jets flying that close that engine noise from the group would be loud.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Regardless, the lighting as a whole emanating from the objects, appeared to imply that the objects were fairly large, even if they were flying low, I can’t say that I could liken these to aircraft lighting as I’ve seen plenty of aircraft lights and are in comparison much smaller even at low altitudes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There were no other lights coming from the objects, certainly none of the colors you would see on conventional aircraft, only an overall orange glow.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They didn’t seem to be moving real fast but it was dark and I couldn’t really compare their speed to anything in the area, although it took me about 5 to 7 min to drive around the block by the time I got to the original area where I saw them, they were gone… all of them! They could have disappeared into the clouds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I thought they might be candles or something but they just seemed too bright, too big, too round and were obviously moving faster than they appeared to be moving originally.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Maybe I’ll find out what they were eventually and it will turn out to be something not so extraordinary! But as of right now I can’t identify them as much as I’d like to.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Somehow my gut tells me that it’s something completely explainable although I’m not sure where that feeling is coming from.<n>

We looked up and noticed a craft heading straight towards us, it was pretty low over the town and had two bright white lights with two smaller ones on the outer edges.  It was cone or pie-slice shaped on its side with the rounded part facing us and the pointed part facing away from us.  We could see the shape because it was like a dark shadow outline of the craft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After it got fairly close to us, it stopped and began to move sideways towards the south.  It continued moving south and then disappeared.  On my way back home, people at the Gas station on Waverly st and 175th were reporting seeing lights over the municipal airport.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They said all of the cars headlights went out simultaneously at the gas station, and as soon as the lights disappeared, the headlights came back on.  I don&#39;t know if it is related, but three nights ago around 1am, I was driving to pick up my boyfriend from work and saw a tall, skinny, greyish-brown creature crossing the road.  It had to be 8-9ft tall and only took two steps to get across two lanes and it disappeared into the darkness on the other side of the road.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This also took place near Waverly st and 175th by the municipal airport.<n>

She told me that the object wasn’t like an airplane, since we live near Hartfield International Airport.  I looked for a place to pull over to get a better look.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As we came to the top of the street near an open field, I exited the car to look for the object.  Between two trees, slightly below the treeline, facing East, I saw a white/silverfish cylinder shaped craft/object hovering in the air.  It looked to be metallic because of the way the sun reflected the light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> From the distance I observed it at, it had to be nearly ½ mile long.  It hovered without a sound for a few seconds, shifted to the right slightly, shifted to the left then shot out of sight to the left (towards the South).<n> <n><n> <n><n> I just stood there amazed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object was gone before I had a chance to get my camera up.<n>

Our camera is a Canon Power Shot SX 200.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The sky was perfectly clear. I supported the camera on the balcony railing, and snapped several shots with the camera set for maximum zoom.  The camera has a 12X optical zoom and a 48X digital zoom.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I took two pictures of the moon.  As I composed another shot, I noticed a bright object, which appeared to be rapidly heading for the moon from the right.   It was red-yellow in color, had a long, narrow, horizontal shape and appeared to be glowing on its own.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I pressed the shutter release and recorded the object as it appeared to pass just in front of the lunar horizon.  After that, I did not see the object any more.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The time stamp on the picture shows 21:30 hours Central European Summer Time, which is 19:30 hours UTC or GMT.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

No sound was heard and the objects seemed to be moving 600-1000mph.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Behind those 7 orbs came 5 more orbs same altitude and speed.  All 12 orbs did a corkscrew curve into a huge thunderhead.  The accelerated quickly into the cloud.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After that, it down poured like I have never seen before for only 2 minutes then the weather turned beautiful.  That same night I was in my backyard having a fire and I heard what sounded like footsteps in the neighbor&#39;s back yard.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I stood up and went over past the hedge in my yard and on the border of my neighbors yard and the next yard I saw a figures silhouette in the trees.  I saw the head and it seemed about twice the size of a human head.  The figure was all black because of the time of night, and the light from the second yard downs window.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I felt an intense feeling come over me.  Not fear but like it was trying control my emotions.  I whistled and the creature tan away I heard five bipedal footsteps before it ran through the treeline two yards down that is like 50 feet in five steps.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I felt sick to my stomach afterwards for five days and when I went over to where I saw the creatures head silhouetted in the light from the neighbors window the creature had to be at least seven feet tall.  It fealt was up to no good.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I need to be contacted by an agent if possible because there are other related events to this one.  I was visiting my mom in Maine I live in Vermont.<n>

The sky was mostly clear with some light clouds.  Air was calm.  I looked up in the sky and saw a flash of light through the clouds.  The light flashed on, then quickly off.  It flashed on and off again within  seconds, but was already quite a distance south of where I first saw it.  It continued flashing and moving north to south, until out of sight.  I did not see any craft or what might have caused the light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The light illuminated an oval shape through the clouds and larger than anything I have ever seen in the sky before.  I don&#39;t know the dimensions, but it dwarfed any aircraft I&#39;ve ever seen.  You could compare it to a honeybee on a football.  There was no sound at all.  There is no aircraft I know of that could illuminate such a large area.  Could not tell how high it was because it was above a line of clouds the whole time, but just above the planes flying in the area, which were clearly visible.<n>

We watched it for about four minutes before it just disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After trying to figure out what we just saw I looked up in the sky at the opposite direction of last sighting, and noticed another bright light, not as bright as the last one, moving about.  This one was a little different as it didn&#39;t fly in a straight line, but would fly for a couple seconds then drop down a little bit, and a couple seconds later fly upwards again, this continued for another 7 minutes to which it finally disappeared.<n>

They were blinking and moving in one direction, but then back tracked and blinked in different patterns.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then one fireball or light broke into about 5 pieces and travelled upward together, while two other lights appeared to mimicking each other, while blinking back and forth to each other.  They would stay close to each other throughout the whole duration, but the two that mimicked each other (away from the other five) would some times back track, as if to go in reverse quickly and sort of far away, then come right back to where they were.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were not in toxicated and do not do drugs, but are school teachers who would not have believed anyone if they told us......! we have never seen anything like this and I&#39;m sure we will never again.

I saw many orange/red star shaped lights plainly in the sky, seemed to be at a low elevation.  There were at least 15 lights in a formation closely resembling the big dipper.  It was so vivid and apparent, I automatically assumed it was some kind of man-made event.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was alone in my car, but there were lots of vehicles traveling, all those folks had to see them also.  I thought it was a carnival, perhaps lights on a Ferris wheel.  The closer I got, it became painfully evident these were not Ferris wheel lights, cell tower lights, aircraft or even the Big Dipper itself.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I noticed the bottom two lights would turn off and on, they also switched positions.  The rest of the lights were totally stationary.  They did sort of resemble flare lights, but couldn&#39;t have been because of the formation, stationary position and those bottom two lights moving left to right.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This was an astounding site, I was literal! ly in shock as I drove by them.  I didn&#39;t stop, I was on an expressway, but I did wonder why people weren&#39;t stopping to take photo&#39;s and video&#39;s.  Perhaps someone did, I certainly hope so. I have traveled this road many times, and have never seen anything even close to looking like this.  That&#39;s why I thought a carnival with rides was recently set up.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I hope others will report this and if there&#39;s a legitimate reason for the lights, I would love to know the source.<n>

Canterbury, New Hampshire.  My boyfriend and myself were in our back yard admiring fire flies, this is when we walked over to a path we have leading to our chicken coop; my boyfriend noticed in the sky what he thought to be planes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About 100 feet from where we stood we saw 3 red bright lights round in shape.  There were two red lights that were clearly separate objects following closely to a much larger object. It flew closer approximately 50 feet above us very fast.  When it was above the tree tops we could see them in an opening of the trees.  I saw a triangular shaped flying object with a haze around it very large in size with red lights, two separate objects trailing behind it, both were red lights moving in their own paths.  The two red lights were flying behind it never beside it.  The 3 objects hovered slowly over the tree tops towards the north silently as they flew over our pond we could not see them because of the trees.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is my account.<n>

It went out like someone flipped a switch, reappeared flashing 2 x 3 times.

We looked up around 9:00pm (give or take a few minutes) on the night of Thursday, 6/20/13 and saw an orange light appear out over the ocean.  I would guess the light was anywhere from 3-5 miles out to sea.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I initially thought it was a distress flair from a ship, but I noticed after a few seconds that the light had remained totally still. It did not flicker or waver or move at all.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After several seconds, a second light appeared to the left of the first light.  It was identical to this first light.  These two lights would then alternate with one being on and one being off for a few seconds, then a third and fourth light appeared, again to the left of the original two lights.  The pattern of alternating with one being on then off continued for a few more seconds before the lights all went off but for one.  This one lingered for a few more seconds before! finally just disappearing altogether.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The whole time there were no sounds heard.  Simply orange lights out in the sky that we could not explain, as they did not behave like distress flairs nor like any known aircraft we are aware of.<n>

My eye was caught by something in the dark night&#39;s sky across the river over Quebec.  I looked towards the object and it seemed to be a large orange object just hovering over the edge of the land just past Mud Island but across the river in Quebec.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I watched the object (not sure if it was a circle or what but appeared so) and to my total shock all of a sudden an identical orange object, same size and shape, appeared very close to the first object.  It didn&#39;t fly there, it just appeared, as if it had turned on a light or just appeared out of nowhere.  I couldn&#39;t believe my eyes.  The 2 objects stayed in the same place.  About 10 seconds later I was stunned to witness a 3rd object, same size as the other 2, same color and shape appear next to the other 2 - same distance apart.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At that point I ran across the hall to get my neihgbour.  I was gone only maybe 1 minute but when I got back with her to show her the 3 objects 2 of them were gone and the 3rd one (the first I saw in the sky) was descending straight down towards the ground.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Unfortunately there were clouds down low so the object went behind the cloud so I couldn&#39;t see how far down it went or if the other 2 were there as well - behind the clouds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My neighbour did witness the last half of the last object descend so she did see one as well.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As we stood there, not more than 15 seconds after the last object descended, we were stunned to witness something hitting the ground just off to the left of where the 3 objects once sat in the sky.  It appeared that perhaps these shots being fired might well have been coming out of the 3 objects in the sky.  The shots were fired downwards towards the earth on the Quebec side, not up at the sky and when each shot hit the ground (you could see light trails coming down from where the craft were) there was a loud explosion and corresponding flare-up of light.  We must have witnessed at least a dozen of these shots hitting the ground.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was no sound from any of the craft while they were forming in the sky and no sound except for when the shots hit the ground -no sound of them being fired that I remember hearing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My neighbour and I waited to see if the craft would fly away but there was no sighting after the shots were fired at all.  They just disappeared or left undetected.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I haven&#39;t heard of anyone else who saw what we did.  I called a local tv station and reported it and they said that they would look into it but I never heard back.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Someone must have seen it besides me.  There are many dwellings on the Ottawa side of the Ottawa River near Mud Island.  Would be interested in hearing about any other similar sighting.  I noticed that in Quebec orange balls have been seen before  Interesting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The room we viewed the craft from and the explosions was a typical apartment living room with one light on in the background.  It was getting dark at night when I saw all of this but there was still a bit of light out but not much.  It was around 8 PM in the evening.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I couldn&#39;t tell clearly if the objects were round or what but the startling thing was that they were quite big even from the distance across the river and they were a bright orange color.  Quite different from craft that we normally see.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have not seen this again since that night.<n>

This object was not making any type of typical aircraft engine sounds, such as jet engines, or prop engine noise.  My girl friend noticed that it seemed to rotate, like a thrown football spiral, as it did this, the only light coming from the object was white, which seemed to get brighter with the phase of each time it rotated around, and then slightly dim as it spiraled.  We watched this object for almost a minute head east, no other strobe lights could be seen blinking, only white light.  At that point, the object&#39;s white light started to dim, and eventually went out all together, not because of it moving away I don&#39;t believe,we watched a short time longer waiting to see if it came back on, it did not.  The object was totally silent, uncommon for having an airport nearby in Indianapolis, and at Purdue Univ! ersity. Someone needs to check this area or skies out at night, not the first time seeing this.<n>

Was as high up as a small crop duster plane would be at max height. After it passed the house, I shined a powerful flashlight towards it.

I went around the back of my home to where I always park my car.  As I approached my car, I noticed a very bright object high in the western sky.  It appeared to be moving very, very slowly…so slowly in fact, it could almost pass for a star.  I stopped to look at the object one more time before entering my car.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is when I noticed that the object was sort of cone shaped in the front and to the rear of the direction of its travel.  The brightness increased as it got closer to me.  It turned from a dim white to a very bright whitish yellow.  Once inside of my car, I opened the “moon roof” to get another view of the object while letting my car to warm up.  After about two minutes of observing this thing, the object was almost directly over me.  Its speed increased dramatically as it flew overhead.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What made this thing so strange is that it made no noise and it had no navigation (red/white blinking) lights on.  The only thing that I can think of that this object may have been is the ISS. It maintained a very lateral or horizontal line of travel. The object appeared as if it had a super extended cone of light to the forward and aft position of its travel.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Anyway, after maybe a couple of more minutes, the object settled into the eastern sky and disappeared over the horizon.  Except for the cone shapes in the front and back of the object, it resembled a regular satellite in the night sky (only much bigger) or even the ISS.<n>

She turned around and called me over to see it but by the time i got there, it was gone.  I then began to ask her questions.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The first question I asked was what it looked like.  She described it as a white circlular object. She said it looked like a full moon, but smaller.  She told me it was no star. It couldnt have disappeard like that if it were any planet.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I then began to do some research right away.  I looked for ufo sighting with in the same city and the same month.  I then came across a video of a sighting in my city that happened 4 days prior to today.  I showed my sister the video and she said it looked exactly like the one she saw. My heart literally sunk thats when i knew i had to report it.  I need answers.  I want to know what is going on.  I just think it&#39;s very frightening because the same object was seen in the same city and state 4 days earlier.<n>

I pointed it out to my son who also saw the object.  It travelled to our location as we stopped at a red light at the intersection of Freeport Road and Alabama Avenue.  The object stopped directly above us and we opened the car windows and looked straight up at the motionless quiet object. All four of use saw the object.  It was circular in shape and orange in color.  Orange flames were shooting out of the bottom as if it were a rocket.  The object made no noise and just hovered in that position.  When the light turned green we moved and the object moved a short distance in the same direction and then vanished.  We attempted to get a video, but it is poor quality as it was taken with an I-phone and is very short.<n>

Appeared and disappeared like a flip of a switch<n> <n><n> <n><n> On June 19, 2013 I was driving due east on Artesia Road, a dirt road, to return home from a trip into town.  Artesia Road is about 12 to 13 miles due south from Safford, Graham, Arizona.  My daughter was with me and it was about 9:30 p.m  (2130) to 9:45 p.m. (2145).<n> <n><n> <n><n> I always look around when I drive.  We have to watch out for coyotes, snakes, deer, etc. on the road.  There is one house on Artesia Road that has tall pine trees in front of the property.  In the county, where Artesia Road is and where we live, most people have what is called a safety light on telephone and or electrical poles since there is no other source of lighting to light their property.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A light caught my eye and at first I thought it was a safety light coming on, although coming on late since it was very dark.  I saw the light through the pine trees.  I thought it was shorted out or something.  As I passed the pine trees and was able to see the sky without any obstructions, I noticed another light that appeared, like someone flipped a switch.  I said “I don&#39;t believe it”.  My daughter said “Not again” referring to the UFO light I saw last year.  I said “Yes, there are the same UFO lights I saw last year” (also in the exact same area and also in the east sky.  The one light I saw last year was south east.)  Both lights were orange/red, more on the red side.  They were side by side.  They appeared for only about 20 seconds.  I stopped the car to watch.  When they disappeared, once again, it was like a switch was flipped.  They appeared suddenly and disappeared suddenly.  No fading in or out, no traveling across the sky (like one would see on an airplane in the night sky), no blinking, no fading like a flare would.  The first light appeared and about 5 seconds later the second light appeared.  After about 20 seconds the first light to appear disappeared first and then about 3 seconds later the second light disappeared.  They appeared and disappeared in the blink of an eye, it was that fast.  They were quite large.<n>

It then started to drop and immediately burst into yellow flames and fell toward the ground.  It seemed to be completely burnt up by the time it hit the ground.  We then noticed what could have been a helicopter leaving the area heading north.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I grabbed my camera and got 5 excellent photos of whatever it is!  This may turn out to be a satellite but the Nikon Coolpix P 500 I used has a 36X optical zoom and I&#39;m just not sure if it could capture clear photos of a craft in orbit.  You will notice in photos that there are different profiles suggesting that maybe it is turning.  I will send all 5 photos and a short video clip if I can.   Thanks !<n>

I immediately took notice of an oval-oblong chrome object moving silently across a crystal clear blue sky.  No clouds in sight.  I immediately parked my car and got out and continued to watch it as it moved to the west.  As I was watching it, another object, oval-oblong chrome, seemed to &#39;appear&#39; and began moving north toward Dayton.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The first object continued in its west direction.  The objects made no sound.  Then a passenger jet began approaching from the west.  It looked like a JET - no confusion. It was distinctly a passenger Jet. Curious about the sighting, I googled the search UFOs seen over Lebanon Ohio June 19, 2013.<n> <n><n> <n><n> To my surprise, a video is posted of a &amp;quot;fleet of UFO&#39;s seen over Montgomery Ohio on June 16, 2013&amp;quot;. Montgomery is about 20-30 minute drive south of Lebanon. Here is the link to that video<n> <n><n> <n><n> http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x110apl_ufo-fleet-over-montgomery-ohio-15-june-2013_tech#.UcHjvJyA_f1<n>

I am shocked and no one believe me if I tell them what I saw.<n>

6/19/13 01:30|Blythe|CA|Sphere|4 minutes|Orange/ Red sphere 25 to 35 feet across moving  slow and on a low level altitude|9/30/13|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/102/S102548.html|279|ndxe201306| Orange/ Red sphere 25 to 35 feet across moving  slow and on a low level altitude<n> <n><n> <n><n> On 6/19/2013 at 1:30 am I had to take the trash out for pick up.  If I did not forgot the week before I would not have gone outside that night.  The front of my home looks to the South  and it is one block from the Colorado River and 8 miles North- North East of  Highway I-10. About 20 feet before the street I happened to look up and to the East.  I saw a Orange/ Red sphere over the top of one of the River Front homes and moving East over the top of a row of homes when the object got to the end of the homes it made a U-Turn  and was heading  West- North West and right at me I was still in the same spot as I was when I first saw it.  The object was only about 100 to 150 feet off the ground and was moving slow  It made no sound or moved any air.  I remember looking to see if someone was projecting this from the ground but saw no light beams   It is very dark in the community do to no street lights and only 2 or 3 coach light in the front of  each house.  This Orange/ Red sphere was about 25 to 35 feet across max 40 feet   The color is strange and one you will not forget it looked as if it moved in waves fast to slow.   It just stopped in the air  about 50 yards from me as if what ever it was saw me as I was looking at it the center sphere was  in motion moving around the object.  I stood looking at it for maybe 30 to 45 seconds and then it hit me to run in and get the camera as I moved and started for my house the object started to move at the same time going  North- North East.  By the time I got back it was to late I could not get a picture.  The object starting to move at the same time I did is why I say it was looking at me as I was looking at it.  The object never changed it’s altitude from the I first saw it to I ran back with the camera.  It was CRAZY<n>
6/19/13 00:15|Kells (Ireland)||Changing|45 minutes|I SAW A VERY LARGE ORANGE SHAPE AND SIZE CHANGING LIGHT WHICH MOVED SLOWLY AND DIVIDED IN SECTIONS|7/3/13|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/099/S99584.html|280|ndxe201306| I SAW A VERY LARGE ORANGE SHAPE AND SIZE CHANGING LIGHT WHICH MOVED SLOWLY AND DIVIDED IN SECTIONS<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was watching the television around 0:15 am and heard the dogs barking I went to look out the window as I normally would and did not see or hear what they were barking at but instead could not help to notice this huge orange coloured light in the sky.it stands out very noticeably.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first as i seen it, it was a distorted light or like a light with no shape to it as in my terms a fluffy shape like a cloud but smaller than a cloud in my vision (which is very good vision) it looked to be the size of about 10 north stars put together but the edge around this single light was fluffy shape (like a cloud).  It made me think there was a hole in the sky and this light was shining through this hole.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There were no clouds in the sky at all and I could see stars all over the sky, but I noticed a trail of what looked to resemble a cloud stretched out across the sky and it was linked to the light as in touching it.It was like a thin line of fluffy cloud going in a very near straight line to where the light was.  I believe it was not a cloud but more like smoke, gas, dust or steam which this light left behind it as it moved across the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was moving but very very slowly in my eyes.It seemed to be very very close to land or ground as did the gas or smoke cloud.I could see the beginning of the cloud trail as I call it which just started straight outside my house basically in front of me, it just seemed to appear or start out of nowhere as I could see its tail end or beginning in front of me, there were no other trails anywhere just this one.  Going by the ground as measurement as it seemed very close to it, the distance it travelled was about one mile.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The trail was already in the sky when I looked out and our dogs had stopped barking after about 5/10 mins.  As I watched this orange light it started getting bigger slowly and it eventually got to a size of about 2 or 3 full moons put together, like as if it were another planet and also took a circular shape like a full moon with no fluffy edges around it.  It was freaking me out a bit, but I am very interested in this stuff so I kept watching.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It then split up into 3 or 4 sections in an odd way, but the sections stayed close together they didn&#39;t seem to take of in any direction.  Then they all started to shrink and fade at the same time slowly returning to a single light.It then was almost gone to a faded star size and then slowly start to get bigger and brighter again and eventually went to the same size and shape again about 2 or 3 full moons put together.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It started splitting up again into 3 or 4 sections and back again to shrinking and fading and coming back to one small faded light.It seemed to be over the one area for some time whilst it was doing this and as it was splitting up it also looked like it was lowering itself to the ground slowly.  The top third or quarter section seemed to drop to the bottom, like it was falling through the other sections.  This happened at least 3 times.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It may have changed its direction and went behind the hills making it look to me that it was lowering to the ground but I finally couldn&#39;t see it any longer as it went down lower behind the hills or somewhere.  I did try to look at it through binoculars and didn&#39;t notice anything else and it seemed to be easier and much better to watch with just the naked eye.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I watched this for about 45 mins,it was silent all the time and when it disappeared I just had to Google what I saw.  As I was typing in Google I heard this boom sound.It was an unusual boom but hard to explain.I looked out once again and saw nothing.  I went back to Google and was hard to explain and I ended up coming back to this website of NATIONAL UFO REPORTING CENTRE which I have visited before because of similar strange things I have seen and read a few more reports.  This is the website where I have seen so many people explain their sightings as good as identical to my sightings.  But still it seems nobody has a clue of what these things are.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have watched the sky for years and also have had a wonderful site up very high to be able to see all around me counting numerous towns and on a clear day could see even further.  I have seen these YELLOW ORBS also which flair up really bright to the size of about 5 north stars if not bigger and then fade down getting smaller to about the size of a north star only a little bigger.  These things are out to be seen almost every night only it probably depends on your location.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They sit over different towns without moving for a few mins could be any lenght of time 30 mins or longer or shorter I&#39;ve seen these just sit there and then when they go small to size of just a bit bigger than north star they move across the sky to sit over another town and when they move they move fast.  Even faster than a helicopter it seems.  Also when they sit still they seem to be perfectly still not a move.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have seen hot air balloons, helicopters etc.This is not normal and for the amount of times I have seen these things which dont seem to be too high in the sky I really cannot understand how or why they have not been properly investigated by the right people as they are plain to be seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is REAL, and to come onto a website because you have seen these things and are sure your not seeing things and desperatly want to know what these things are and find that there are hundreds if not thousands of reports of the same sightings explained identical to mine and other peoples in most cases to me seems very weird that this has not been checked out.<n> <n><n> <n><n> These yellow orbs as I also had called them myself before visiting this site are nothing like what I have seen recently with the big orange shape changing light, but I know the reports are realistic from the way there described.  I have seen these things hundreds of times already.  I am not being smart but only honest and I have to say with the amount of identical reports reported on this site I really really can&#39;t understand why there is nothing in the sky to check these things out.  Is all those reports from different locations even across the world not enough proof??<n> <n><n> <n><n> I dont think we are all in some weird group that has hundreds or thousands of people belonging to it from different countries who just wants to tell lies on this subject or website.what would we benefit from it??  All we get is a sore hand from typing and no action response just an ear that listens.  Maybe I am wrong that National report centre or other people are not doing something about this but it&#39;s going on a very long time.  With the technology these days why is this such a hard thing to research or find out about??  All I can say is watch the sky and believe us in this much anyway.  THIS IS NOT FICTION.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have excellent eyesight, I am very interested in the sky, I am not colour blind and do not take drugs or have any visions.  **PLEASE PLEASE TRY TO LOOK INTO THIS PROPERLY IT IS NOT A JOKE**.  Also feel free to ask me any questions<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date is approximate.  PD))<n>

He lives on the south side of Tucson and while I was driving he was looking out the window he told me to look at this light in the sky further south a yellowish color light fading in and out in the sky.  We pulled onto Park off of Valencia south by the airport where it was darker.  These were not airplanes or any type of craft we&#39;ve seen.  The lights would appear in a row and fade away.  What really gave me the chills was when two lights appeared and one faded away on the right and one on the left had a few other lights appear right next to it and faded away looked like a circular craft with lights around it.  I have a few videos especially of this one and I don&#39;t think I can upload it cause its with my phone.<n>

Not sure of the elevation but I was looking in the W/SW direction. What I saw appeared to be a faintly luminous, but not artificially lit object, more oval/saucer in shape.  It was faintly yellow, pink and orange in color - almost transparent but I couldn&#39;t see the clouds through it. It seemed suspended for about three seconds in the sky and then it shot off horizontally, accelerated at a speed - defying any aircraft I&#39;ve ever seen.  It left a blur of a trail, like the light of the craft had blurred in its absence as it went into the tops of the storm clouds across from it.  The cloud coverage was too dense were it went so I wasn&#39;t able to track it.<n>

Starting off with only myself as a witness, and on the last occasion, including my Fiance in the sighting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On the first night of this experience, I was alone outside my home enjoying a cigarette. Gazing at the night sky as I always do, partly because I love outer space, and partly because this is definitely not my first experience with UFO&#39;s.  Nothing was unusual when I ended my smoke, and went inside to the kitchen for a snack.  I got what I needed, and began to head downstairs to my living room to watch TV, or just relax.  The door to outside my home, is at the top of my staircase and I looked out the window as I was headed passed.. and saw a light in the sky, like a dominant star, that surely wasn&#39;t present when I was outside just moments before.  So I stopped for a harder look, and noticed it was moving slightly..  Then it stopped. I had a strange feeling wash over me, as if this thing could see me...  So I slung open the door, triggering my motion sensor porch light, and I stepped outside.  At this very moment, it picked up moving slowly again, than accelerated at an indescribable rate.  I took a &amp;quot;U&amp;quot; shaped, arched path,  Straight out of the Earths atmosphere, and it was gone!  I told my Fiance about this experience that very night, when I joined her in bed for slumber, and we went on with our lives.  About a week and half later, her and I were having a bit of a disagreement late at night.  So I decided to just go for a walk, and cool off. I sat at a park, on a swing set at a local nearby elementary school for, a good hour.  Smoking a few cigarettes, and reflecting on the situation at hand, and how to handle it upon returning home to my Fiance.  I was looking at the sky, and stars for this entire hour or so, seeing nothing unusual. I got up and started walking home, eventually turning the corner to the road I reside on. I glanced into the sky, in the same direction I first witnessed the ball of light, and much to my surprise, THERE IT WAS! It acted in the almost exact same manner as it did the first occasion, moving very slowly.  I took it upon myself to wave my arms in the air, because again, I had the feeling this thing could see me, for whatever reas! on.... And when I waved my arms... it again accelerated at an unearthly rate, and left the earths atmosphere!  I once again, returned home, and explained to my Fiance that I had damn near the same experience as I had a week or so prior.  This time it was a little bit deeper conversation, as I obviously was a bit more shaken up. I described it to her in high detail, from it just being a white orb of light, to its flight path out of the atmosphere, and out of sight... And we once again, simply returned to our everyday life.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The very next night, at about 11:00pm, we decided it was a nice night for a mutual walk. We went to the same park, at the same school, I visited the night before alone. We sat on the same exact swing set, and talked for a while. Then decided to head home. We together turned the corner to my house... and I looked again, where I had seen it the first two occasions for shits and giggles.. and I could not believe my eyes when it was actually there again.. I stopped dead in my chances and said, excuse my french.. &amp;quot;Fucking Look&amp;quot;! My Fiance then looked into the sky, and seen the orb of light I had describe to her twice in the last week. This time was a bit different, though. It was again, slowly moving.. but this time it was steady, and coming straight for us. It was dimming slightly, and returning back to its usual brightness, as it was headed twords us... it wasn&#39;t changing in elevation at all, as it went right over our heads. Eventually passing us, and then it took its! same arched flight path, right out of the atmosphere, and out of sight!  This is something that happened to me alone, twice. I explained it to my Fiance both times, on the night of the occurrences.. Then on the last occasion, she was there to witness EXACTLY what I had described to her. Validating everything to her, and even completely to myself. It is 100% unexplainable, and the way it happened, leaves no question in our minds of that. I couldn&#39;t make that up twice, and have exactly what I had said, happen a third time.. with a second witness. We are both still absolutely amazed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thanks for your time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date is approximate.  PD))<n>

Ran inside to get me. We both came outside and seen a small bright glowing object. It almost appeared to me to be what looked like a Chinese glowing lantern, however, it then picked up speed and disintegrated. It started out at the top of the tree line, went behind the trees and I was expecting it to come out the other side of the tree line in about the same height level, but when it came out on the other side it was so far away I could hardly see it. If this was a lantern, it wouldn&#39;t have floated that far! It slowly just disappeared. I was very scared, shaking, hair on end. We stood in awe, went to turn around, walking back to the house and there was another large flash through the air, quick, so quick we couldn&#39;t tell what it was, or if it was the same type of object. As quick as a falling star for this one, frightened me, I grabbed the other witnesses arm and screamed, we both said &amp;quot;what was that&amp;quot;. Just cau! ght our attention, but scared us both and hair on end. So, we clearly seen the one object, after that disappeared and were walking back to the house we seen the bright flash of light, but never seen an object, it was far too fast.<n>

When I checked it it was not saved and the battery was restored.  The object got dimmer as it came down slowly.  There was only one object to our knowledge.  The object was bigger and brighter than a star. It was a bright white color.<n>

There was a bright, gold, asterisk-looking light moving from west to east across the night sky.  This was last Monday June 17th between 10:00pm and 12:30am central time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I pointed out the light to my husband and we stopped for a bit to “let it catch up to us” as we were walking in an easterly direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It moved very fast across the sky; too high and irregular to have been a satellite or asteroid. I began talking to it; telling the beautiful light that “we&#39;re trying to be in peace; we know it looks bad with all the war and whatnot, but we really have peace in our hearts.”  Then it stopped and descended very fast and the glow was brighter, with the scatter pattern of light getting bigger and brighter.  I continued talking to this thing/entity/ship/etc.  It moved from east to west; every once in a while along its flight path it would wiggle from south to north a tiny bit, and then continue along a very definable straight course.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It lasted about 3 minutes, and we have been looking up around that time periodically throughout the last week and they appear to be showing up between the hours of 11:30pm and 12:30 am CST in the southeastern Nebraska area. Unfortunately, our camera is not fancy enough to catch these things; anyone have stills or even a video? Please share.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Coincidentally, we saw a youtube video tonight of a similar occurrence in Brazil:<n> <n><n> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mmpj7MqBAAk&amp;list=FL02hH42H4ErIA4OQ1twIdpQ&amp;index=1<n> <n><n> <n><n> The one we saw did not come as close, but appears to be similar in presentation, technology and design.  Anyone else seeing these in the midwest over the past 2 weeks?<n> <n><n> <n><n> On that night we also saw 2 lights hover, and then the one nearest to the horizon shot out an orangish-reddish blinking light, or drone, or plane of some sort which then traveled in a southwesterly direction.  It appeared to be cloaking itself as an everyday plane, but we saw where it came out of: the light that at first appeared to be a very bright star.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Over the course of that night, we saw many star ships.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was unlike anything else I&#39;ve ever seen.<n>

I saw a round bright white light from the east above Route 40 headed west above Route 40 at an extremely high rate of speed. It did a tiny little loop and kept going west.  It may have been a second or three but it was so fast. It was too close to the ground to be an aircraft and also too small.  It was just a bright white light, not so bright that it hurt the eyes though.  It was like a super sized version of an LED light.  I was shocked that I could not find any other reports of this event online.<n>

Lots of stars and sure enough I saw a large light moving across the sky at rapid speed, almost straight overhead. it appeared to be at very high altittude perhaps outside our atmosphere and then I noticed a smaller similar object trailing its trajectory at the exact same speed and flight path but a considerable distance behind the first object which was much larger. I watched them both move acros the entire overhead sky and when they got to about 45 deg from my position they started to fade and simply dissapeared?  The first object was much bigger than anything in the sky and the second was about the size and appearance of a small star but both were moving at incredible speed because they covered the entire sky in just a short time ?  So it had to be in excess of 25k mph .<n> <n><n> <n><n> What has stuck with me as well is that prior to this I had been having thoughts that I was going to see a UFO ! and that night I just had a powerful thought and went outside solely because of that premonition and looked up and immedediately saw the large object moving very fast across the sky ? I have no idea what I saw , but I have known nearly my entire life that something is out there because I saw a UFO when I was a small child at Lake Havasu on the Arizona side . Lots of people saw it and were quite afraid and disturbed . It looked like a ball of fire hovering about 5 miles away between two mountains on the other side of the river and it just stayed there for a longtime before it started moving around and then just dissappeared ? So I grew up understanding that such things exist but not fully understanding exactly what they are . I have been told I was highly telepathic and spiritual because others have felt my thoughts ? Pretty strange , but I have had all manner of odd and very different experiences in my life that are completely unexplainable . For me the important part of th! is was the fact that I seriously knew about 2 weeks prior that! soemthi ng like this was gonna happen and it did . I am relatively certain it is not over and more to come ? I can just feel it but don&#39;t know why ? Just a feeling and what I saw was definitely real . As real as the sun or the moon . I have pondered the UFO phenom considerably over many years and I am convinced that there is a stong connection between UFOs/so called aliens and what we all percieve as God ? It is all connected for sure and I think I know how and why ? Tomorrow nite I am going out to a remote spot and view the Mega Moon and take some photpgraphs and I halfway expect to see more ? Maybe not but tomorrow ,but I have a strongfeeling I will and soon . I honestly don&#39;t have any idea where this came from exactly it is just a feeling ? And I have learned to pay attention to my intuition or feelings ! I pray and meditate a lot and am very much in touch with my own powers and inner self . I am 65 years old and very fit and healthy and strong . For me this was a sign of some so! rt and I am still pondering it and completely open to additional information . The only reason I responded is to see if others reported the same phenom at the same time or ? We are being sent messages of some sort or warnings or something ? not sure yet but I am working on it in my own way !<n>
6/16/13 22:30|Sioux City|IA|Triangle|10-15 minutes|A triangular UFO was found hovering in the sky and remained there for several minutes until flying out of sight.|7/3/13|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/098/S98706.html|307|ndxe201306| A triangular UFO was found hovering in the sky and remained there for several minutes until flying out of sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I went outside the house at around 10:30 PM to find a bright object floating in the sky. It was stationary, but also flickered and looked like it was changing colors.  It was very strange-looking, but I thought it might be a star.  After watching it for many minutes and calling out a second person to view it, I got a pair of binoculars (7x50) from inside the house to get a better look at it.  With the binoculars I was able to see the object in much greater detail.<n> <n><n> <n><n> From what I could tell, it was triangular in shape, with at least three lights (one on each side, one in the middle).  The colors of these lights slowly alternated between red and white when seen through binoculars, but the object looked mostly white (pulsating) without binoculars.  At around the same time I started watching with binoculars, the object began to move across the sky in a straight path towards us (the two witnesses).<n> <n><n> <n><n> At one point during this flight, an actual plane flew under it (I think there was a lot of distance between the two, but I’m not sure).  The plane and unidentified object were very different from each other.  The plane was closer to the ground than the other object.  The plane was much smaller, went out of view much faster, and the blinking lights on the plane were much clearer.  The unidentified object took 2-5 minutes to fly across the sky over the house and go out of view.  From what I could tell, there was no noise coming from the craft.  The entire sighting lasted approximately 10 to 15 minutes.<n>
6/16/13 22:00|Holland|OH|Formation|4 minutes|Formation of 13 bright white lights extending 1.5 miles or more.|7/3/13|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/098/S98676.html|308|ndxe201306| Formation of 13 bright white lights extending 1.5 miles or more<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had just left my girlfriend’s house in Perrysburg, Ohio, en route to my home in Holland, Ohio (approximately a 9 mile trip).  I was travelling north of I 475.  About 2 miles before (Exit 6) my exit (Exit 8) off of I-475, I spotted a formation of lights to the west.  This was at 10:34 pm (because I immediately called my girlfriend to tell her what I was seeing).  To put this into geographic perspective, I would estimate the formation to have been south of Holland (but maybe still in Springfield Township) and north of the Maumee River/Lucas-Wood County line.  To be more exact, it started slightly south of I 80/I 90 (Ohio Turnpike).  I am not certain whether it was moving, due to my rate of speed (60 mph), but if it were moving, it was headed south.  It appeared, though, to be stationary.  The formation appeared to be somewhat close to the ground (much lower than a plane would be on approach to the Toledo Express Airport-4 miles away).  I would estimate the fo! rmation as having been 1/4 mile west of I 475.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I counted 12 lights at first, but then a 13th light appeared faintly, almost flickering, towards the end (northern tail) of the formation.  It brightened and its luminosity matched the other lights.  The formation changed slightly twice (as if a few of the lights were swapping places), but wholly in part, kept its original shape.  The lights never changed elevation so they were not floating or falling, and the color remained constant.  When I first noticed the formation, my first thought was, “Wow, that is the brightest, closest constellation that I’ve ever seen.”  It’s then that my eyes noticed far more than the initial cluster of 4 or 5 lights and took in the entire formation.  The formation was at least 1.5 mile long and could have been as long as 2 miles.  Simply put, it was a line of 13 lights (with some derivation from a conceptual straight line) ascending at approximately 30 degrees.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was unable to take a picture due to traffic conditions (too dangerous to pull over) and the fact that I was driving.  Once I reached my exit, I turned left and headed west about 1 mile and parked in a Boston Market fast food drive-thru.  I was looking south over a tree line and I would say that my car was almost perfectly lined with the tail of the formation.  At that point (2 minutes after exiting), I could still see 2 lights and they quickly disappeared (literally went out).  It was approximately 10:38 pm.  There was a male employee sitting on the curb of the parking lot waiting for a ride.  I rolled down my window and asked him if he had seen what I had seen.  He replied, “No,” which wasn’t surprising (he was nose-first in his cell phone).<n> <n><n> <n><n> From there I traveled west 1 mile to my apartment.  I called media outlets, Lucas County Sheriff Dept, Lucas County Port Authority, Toledo Express Airport, Ohio State Highway Patrol, and the 180th Fighter Wing of the Air National Guard.  The media was uninterested and the law was annoyed.  The LCPA, Toledo Express, and The 180th assured me that flight traffic was at a minimum for the evening and that there was no radar evidence of a craft (or crafts) at that time/location.  The LCPA confirmed that the 180th was not running drills or maneuvers.  I also found a night kite flying group (online) based in Perrysburg.  I called their president this morning and he assured me that their flying grounds, so to speak, are located at least 10 miles to the south east of my sighting, and sometimes, weather permitting, 15 miles to the south.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I called the news outlets once again this morning and at least got WTVG Ch. 13 to take my name and number.  For research and record keeping purposes, I am a 32 year old white unmarried, but dating, man.  I have a B.S. degree in education and have worked in sales and marketing for the past 7 years.

6/16/13 22:00|Wood Cross|UT|Fireball|8 minutes|My boyfriend and i were on our way home from my parents when we seen a ball of fire in the the sky.|7/3/13|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/098/S98707.html|309|ndxe201306| My boyfriend and i were on our way home from my parents when we seen a ball of fire in the the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On Sunday June 16, 2013 my boyfriend and I were heading out of the neighborhood going south about to turn on 1500s going east when we see a ball of light in the sky it looked like a big fireball it was moving in the same direction then it stopped and hovered above an old factory that is not in use at the moment.  I then pulled out my phone and started recording this event, once I started recording it start to go towards the north coming at us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I kept recording it with the moon in the background it was about half the size of the moon. We then called my father and he went out into his front yard along with my little brother to see if they could see what we were seeing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The fireball was about 300 or 400 feet above the ground going towards us then it changed directions and started going west.  My father could not see this, from the back it looked like a reddish orange light.  My boyfriend then said he seen it go out and could no longer see it I was still looking at it and it changed to a gray color then it looked like it started falling and kept getting closer to the ground and when it went behind a tree it went out of my view.  As soon as I couldn’t see it anymore a second on appeared in the same place the first one was then again it did the same thing, and my father and brother were able to see the second one the whole thing from about 2 blocks away from where we were.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We proceeded home and my dad stayed out and on the phone with my boyfriend and watched the same thing for a few more minutes and said a third one came and started heading in the direction towards him which would be north and he said it looked like a fireball then it stopped started going west the color went out and shot faster than a plane could go to the west.   He said it looked like a fireball when it was coming towards him then it stopped before it turned and changed into a gray color and looked like it had a reddish/orange lite.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When we got home I then went in my phone to look for the video and it was not there and the one that did record the image did not show.  I found this very weird because I took about 4 minutes of video and it just disappeared off my phone and the whole time we were on the phone with my dad it kept cutting in and out which it should not do that in that area.  Also he thought what was weird was how fast it took off in the opposite direction and that the aircraft did not make any kind of sounds especially  for something of that size and speed it should have sounded like a jet and there was nothing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Not one of us heard a sound like a plane or a jet while the whole thing happen it was silent the whole time except for the normal traffic sounds.<n>

We got out of the car and were marveling at the stars.  They were extremely bright that night.  I could see many satellites, planets, a few meteors passed by, but this light moving at a constant speed appears high up in the sky.  It (they) move faster than a satellite, do not blink but become very bright, then dim randomly at intervals of say 5 to 10 seconds, but there is no pattern.  At one event where I saw one of these lights when it went dim it looked reddish, when bright it looked white.  They move across the sky not changing direction.  I watch the stars every night when its clear and have never seen this type of object until starting around the end of May 2013 up until last week.  This seems reoccurring, not just a random! event seeming that I&#39;ve seen this type of light four times, my fiance&#39; being there twice to witness it with me.  I&#39;d like to know what it is if it can be explained.  It certainly doesn&#39;t look like any satellite I&#39;ve ever seen.<n>

6/16/13 21:00|Tucson|AZ|Light|5 minutes|Sabino Canyon Tucson Arizona night UFO sighting.|7/3/13|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/098/S98717.html|312|ndxe201306| Sabino Canyon Tucson Arizona night UFO sighting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At approx. 21:00 on the night of Sun. June 16th, a friend and I decided to take a night hike of one mile up the paved tram road in Sabino Canyon just on the northeastern edge of Tucson, Az.  The night was totally cloudless and there was enough of a moon to illuminate the nearby mountains and distinguish the mountains from the sky above.  We walked to a turn in the road to a stunning view of the canyon towards the west.  As we proceeded just a few yards farther, I noticed a bright light directly on top of one of the flatter mountain mesas to the southwest.  I was wondering why someone was way up in an almost inaccessible location with a flashlight at that hour of the evening.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The light proceeded to move at a walker&#39;s pace exactly on the top of the ridge line from left to right.  It then began to move faster than a walker&#39;s pace but still appeared to be flashlight size and right on the ridge line.  At times it would disappear and then suddenly reappear farther to the left on a consistent basis.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The next time we looked towards that location, there was an object in the sky at 1/2 mile distance away just above the ridge line but very clearly in the sky and not on the ridge itself.  I could see it as more of a straight line than an object such as a saucer or anything definitive other than a faint, thin line in the sky.  I would have to estimate the length of this line as approx. 60 feet with a very faint red light on its end to the left and a very bright light on its right end.  It remained stationary for the rest of the event.  The red light stayed consistently very faint and clearly was not blinking in any fashion.  The white light however was laser precise and did not have the &amp;quot;cheap&amp;quot; star pattern glare of, say, a car headlight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The white light pulsed in an inconsistent way and changed randomly in its sizes.  This part of the event only lasted at the most half a minute.  My friend and I were excited but were also talking about what we had heard about ET experiences.  Many people have related that some alleged ETs are from the star system Zeta Reticula.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was just telling my friend that and precisely when I said the words, &#34;Zeta Reticula the light abruptly went out and in a split second made a big flash that my friend later said should have illuminated the mountain side due to its brightness.   The light after this went to the relative size it had been earlier.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I don&#39;t recall how this &#34;object&#34; left but in the back of my mind I think it went more to the earlier flashlight sized light and then went out.  This object and lights made no sound whatsoever  and the canyon is a very, very quiet place.  From the beginning of the event to the end the object traversed at most 200 yards of ridge line.  We did not see anything else appear for the rest of our walk up and back.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;m 63 and work in retail.  My friend is in his 50&#39;s and is a professional therapist.  Both of us were wearing glasses but our vision is better than 20/20.  The night sky in this canyon is crystal, crystal clear.<n>

6/16/13 20:41|Milwaukee|WI|Diamond|3-4 minutes|Object was hovering over 500 feet off ground, had no wings, no tail, fire coming from bottom, and certainly intelligently controlled.|7/3/13|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/098/S98726.html|314|ndxe201306| Object was hovering over 500 feet off ground, had no wings, no tail, fire coming from bottom, and certainly intelligently controlled.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was watching the basketball game in the kitchen when I got a call that I wanted to take privately, so I stepped out of the side door of the house.  As I was in a heated debate on the phone, I looked up and noticed something in the distance above the treeline. I stared at it, and as I did so, short bursts of flame began to come from the bottom of the object.  The flame would switch from left to right as the object wobbled a bit; as if it was trying to maintain balance.  That&#39;s when I yelled to my girlfriend to &amp;quot;go get my camera&amp;quot;. She did, but it took at LEAST 40 seconds for her to do so. As I continued to stare at the object, waiting for my camera,  I noticed that the flame at the bottom of the object began to lose it&#39;s intensity.  As the flame went from a full flame to just a red glow, I noticed that the object was slowly losing altitude, and drifting slowly south east, toward Lake Michigan.   As it dropped below the treeline, I began to run out of the ! yard and down the street so I can see around that particular treeline. I could, and again, I could see the object. The red glow at the bottom of the object was barely noticeable at this point, and the object began to descend more straight down than southeast and down as it was before.  It began to lose altitude faster, until it went below the treeline at that location, which was approximately half a city block to the south of where I was when I first began to record.  I waited at this location for about 30 minutes for the object to ascend or reapear, but it never did. While I was recording, I was not looking at the viewfinder; I was just pointing the lens in the direction of the object, so I had no idea if I actually had what I was seeing on the camcorder.  But after a discussion with neighbors and others who were present, I went inside, connected the camcorder to the television, and began to view the footage. I&#39;ve been from that point on, compelled to find out what I saw is.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I contacted the local police, military, FAA, News Stations, etc., trying to find out if they had anything on the radar at that time and area of that day, but.....nothing; even though I expressed to them all that I had this thing on video!!  This incident has not only caused me a great deal of concern, it has changed my life, and challenges many things I believe. I have always been open to the possibility of the existence of such things, but never saw anything that came anywhere near actually convincing me that they are real. All that has changed now though. That thing had no sound whatsoever, it had no wings, and it had no tail end. It looked almost like a giant church bell with a flame at the bottom. Had I not recorded what I was seeing, I would have long since just assumed it was something normal, that can be explained. But after viewing this thing in slow motion on zoom, I am convinced that it is not, and can not. I will be attaching a copy of my video with this report (If it will upload). My animus is to have an expert opinion of what it is! that is on my video. it was certainly intelligently operated, and it was definitely a mechanical craft of some sort, and not a balloon or anything like that. I for some reason had a feeling of desperation as this thing was descending. It is the same desperate feeling I felt that made me look in that direction and up in the first place when I first noticed the object. I&#39;m left feeling as though whatever it was, it was losing power, running out of fuel, or something to that effect, because it seemed to be struggling to maintain it&#39;s altitude. It was a struggle that It evidently lost. The object was moving slowly in the direction of the Lake; which leads me to believe that it was attempting to get out over open water. In  fact, it seemed to be trying very diligently to do so. I have no idea if it landed in the water or over land. All I know is it landed or crashed somewhere slightly south east of where I was, and never came back up. After you review my video, please get back ! to me and let me know what you think. Thank you; verily.<n>

We got out our binoculars to get a better look at them and they were 2 balls of white/yellow light and we watched them as they moved closer to each other for about 4 minutes until one disappeared, we watched the other one for about 6 more minutes as it was moving further away.  Everyone took a turn looking through the binoculars and agreed that they were 2 balls of white/yellow light and definitely not a plane or anything we had seen before.<n>

At first I thought it was a planet that was much brighter than usual, such as Mars but it wasn&#39;t red, it was a very bright blue-ish-white, similar to Xenon headlights color.  At one point I had looked over to my wife to tell her to look at th bright light and she had asked about what it was.  When I looked back to see it, it had moved south and was slightly dimmer.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At this point, I no longer thought it was a planet and started to think it was a plane or helicopter and shortly after we could see the shape go from a round shape that had a tint of blue, to a triangle shape that was more what and looked to have an obvious set of points.  Then I thought it had to be the mast light on top of a yacht or something and was thinking to myself, &#34;It&#39;s gotta be closer than you think!  Is gotta!&#34;<n> <n><n> <n><n> I started to get my iPhone from my pocket but kept getting distracted by moving object that it took me a little bit to get it out and started taking pictures and video. I took a few photos that don&#39;t imply anything special and look like a star or something.  I took a short video of just around 2 minutes and the craft is clearly visible as the light I described.  It&#39;s hard to see the object moving because I was moving the camera.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As my wife and I started to walk back the way we came (heading south, back towards the Hyatt hotel) and a ways away we came upon two women, in their 20&#39;s and I asked them if they could see that light and they started talking about how they had been watching it move and thought it was a planet or a plane too.  So we started thinking about what it could be but as we came up with possibilities, we could de-characterize the behavior of the object with common knowledge of planes and helicopters.  Most moving aircraft will have at least alternating flashing lights on each wing or the top/bottom of the craft. They also don&#39;t move in sharp, zig-zag patterns and erratic flight bahavior we saw.  Then the one of the girls said the same thing I thought about it being the light at the top of a yachts mast and that it could be closer than we think but we could see 3 yachts a couple hundred yards off shore very close to us that didn&#39;t have lights nearly as bright on top and they were not ! moving like the craft in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We all watched it move out over towards the direction of Lahaina. My wife and I said a few things about the event with the 2 girls and headed back towards our hotel and didn&#39;t see the flying craft again.  The craft was obvious to us for about 20-30 minutes from when we first noticed the bright light to the point where we couldnt really see well any longer and headed back to the north side of Ka&#39;anapali where our hotel, the Sheraton, is.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We talked about what we saw and how cool it be to have finally seen a UFO. My wife asked if I was going to tell anybody about it and I said, &#34;I really want to! I don&#39;t know who to tell though!&#34;  I asked her the same thing and she said &amp;quot;Hell no! I don&#39;t want everyone to think I&#39;m crazy!  Nobody would take it seriously anyway.&amp;quot; I said &amp;quot;that&#39;s true but we know what we saw!  That was awesome!&amp;quot;<n> <n><n> <n><n> When we got back to our home on Oahu, we told our roommate and he started making jokes about it. &amp;quot;Did it abduct someone? Could you see little green men flying it? Did you sing the melody (notes from &#39;Close Encounters of the Third Kind&#39;)?&amp;quot; and stuff of that nature were among the few jokes he said and even when my wife backed up my story, however reluctant, our roommate continued with his &amp;quot;witty banter&amp;quot;. I showed him the video I took and he still made fun of our encounter.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I would think it to be very ignorant and nieve of us to think we are alone in the realm of all space and given that time is infinite in past and present, why wouldn&#39;t others have found us by now? It would be equally ignorant and nieve to think our government has flying craft, capable of amazing maneuvers etc.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I cannot explain what I saw as a common aircraft or ship and I know it happened and there were others there to share in this experience. I&#39;m glad and greatful to have had the experience.<n>

Knowing this was not possible for anything I know is currently being flown, I immediately asked my kids to look in the direction I was pointing and asked if they saw the black object in front of the cloud.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Two of my 3 kids acknowledged seeing the black object.  As the traffic light changed I made a left turn and immediately pulled into a service drive to again be facing east.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I still had the object in my sight as did my 13 year old daughter and 8 year old son. The object then began descending straight downward slowly and then disappeared. We stayed for a few minutes to see if it would reapp! ear but it did not.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have watched aircraft my whole life and am good at judging distance. I would say this object was miles away judging by the size and distance of the clouds. Again the object appeared to be a plane because of the smooth straight line of travel it was taking but I could not see any distinguishing shape or trait other than it being black and shaped somewhat similar to an aircraft fuselage.<n>

It was after 3pm but the specific time I cannot say for sure.  We stepped out after the Brewers baseball game and were just talking on the porch about things.  It was defiantly afternoon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My dad first spotted it and the first thing we noticed was it didn’t have wings or a tale.  The “craft” looked like a fuselage of a smaller airplane, maybe a Concord.  There were no windows.  It was flying east to west.  We couldn’t say for sure if it was silent because there was a normal airplane flying high in the sky, and we could hear that engine.  I have witnessed small aircraft take off and land and there is usually a engine whine with it.  Even when they are in the air there is a distinct engine noise.  There was possibly a whisper noise from it but we cannot be 100% on that.  The craft was white in color and you could see a shadow on the bottom, indicating that it was tube shaped.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The craft moved at a somewhat slow pace.  It is hard to estimate air speed, especially by an amateur, but I feel it was flying slower than a normal small engine plane.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was considerable cloudiness this day.  We were able to see the craft go into the clouds and see other more solid clouds behind it.  This, in my opinion, means that it was flying very low.<n> <n><n> <n><n> From what we say the flight path stayed straight.  The craft didn’t turn or go higher or lower, from our point of view.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Porterfield, WI is located in Marinette County and is about 50 miles north of Green Bay, WI.  My dad’s land is in a very unpopulated area and I am not aware of any military base close.<n>

We don&#39;t smoke in the house.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My boyfriend pointed to an orange/amber moving light in the sky out over Lake Ontario to the south of us.  When he first pointed it out, he said he had thought it was an amber streetlight through the trees. Then he noticed it was moving and that it was much larger and further away than he had first assumed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We all stared as the orange light, in absolute silence, steadily moved across the southern sky. Unfortunately, our vision was at times obscured by foliage from the many old and lush trees in our neighbourhood.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I saw it:  He pointed to an orange light through the leaves just above the rear-neighbour&#39;s rooftop.  There was a glowing light which appeared to be: larger than a plane; a non-symmetrical, triangular shape; amber yet orange, yet also reddish... like a flame; moving horizontally, west to east, then to the northeast... then when we lost it, it appeared to be moving east again; an even radiance, not pulsing or flashing; moving indirectly, unlike the usual planes and helicopters we see.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As he described it:  There was only one difference between what he saw and I saw.  At one point, he saw the one light become 3 separate lights still in a triangular position, and then merge back into the one united shape.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The other two moved about the porch to maintain a better view and the two of them kept saying, &amp;quot;It&#39;s a UFO... That&#39;s a UFO!&amp;quot;  Meanwhile, I stood dumbfounded... simply agreeing with them, saying, &#34;I know... It is.&#34;  He went to get the camera. She went through the house and out onto our street to get a less-obstructed view.  I stayed out back not wanting to lose sight of it. When my boyfriend came out with the camera we were already losing it behind the treeline and rooftops.  His mom came back out on the porch just after it had disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We all spoke excitedly for a few minutes about having to check the news later on.  Then she hopped online to see if she could find anyone else talking about it.  He and I went for a walk to the edge of the Scarborough Bluffs (5 mins. away) on the off-chance we might see something else or see it again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;ve always had a healthy amount of skepticism when it comes to anything I&#39;ve never experienced first hand and will continue to.  A couple of hours ago I saw a UFO.  I am certain.<n>

It was bright red, cast a red glow, and left a shimmering rainbow color on the grass and trees.  The effect was like a mirage.  There was no sound.  The UFO was stationary when first viewed, then it moved from south to north. It disappeared like a light going out.<n>

Imagine a blimp with a green light on one end, a red light on the other, and red flashing lights in the middle where the controllers would be. The red lights also ran underneath the object.  I hovered for several minutes in the sky, but I cannot determine how high. It appeared to turn to a clockwise rotation, then moved without sound to the north at a steady speed.  As a blimp would move nose first into the wind, this moved sideways.  As it passed overhead, no outline could be made out using high power binoculars.  Once passed overhead, the lights on each end were now white, and not green and red as before.  15 sober people observed this.  Perhaps it was a drone, just not sure. If I was to guess the length of it, I would say 100 or more feet across.<n>

When they got to a certain point in the eastern sky they would disappear.  It appeared that they were moving in a circular motion as they were going around in the sky.  It lasted at least 20 minutes.  They didn&#39;t appear to be flares, chinese candle lights, or aircraft lights.  At the end we saw a bright white light trailer behind the amber lights and was moving very quickly.  The lights disappeared and we didn&#39;t see them again after we saw the white light following the amber lights.  The most bizarre thing we have ever seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

We pulled over to the side of the road to watch.I took a movie of them on my iPhone.  A car with a man and a woman pulled up alongside ours and the woman asked if we knew what those things were-we said we did not. (It should be noted that about three years agoe we did see two orange fireballs in Brighton, NY (in Rochester) on Monroe Avenue, that looked exactly like these, except they moved in an elliptical pattern around each other.  These ufos moved in a straight line at a steady, consistent pace. We tried to follow the last one but they disappeared.<n>

I was on the North side of the house and they were in the pool on the South side.  So there were at least 5 or 6 orbs noted.<n>
6/15/13 22:00|Westlake|OH|Unknown|4-7 minutes|A few dozen, low-altitude lights flying silently in a loose formation in a south-to-north direction from inland to out over Lake Erie|7/3/13|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/098/S98679.html|341|ndxe201306| A few dozen, low-altitude lights flying silently in a loose formation in a south-to-north direction from inland to out over Lake Erie<n> <n><n> <n><n> Around 10 pm last night (6/15/2013), I was driving westbound on I-90 headed home from Lakewood, Ohio.  After exiting I-90 at Clague Rd in suburban Westlake and then turning south onto Clague, I noticed what appeared to be a pattern of perhaps a dozen or so white lights that I initially thought was &#39;strung out&#39; (perhaps 100 - 200 feet high?) over the rear (eastward) portion of the Crown Water Filtration plant on Clague Rd. At first, I thought the lights were stationary and perhaps were somehow &#39;hung up&#39; as part of some event on a Saturday night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> While driving south on Clague, I kept looking to the left (east) above the water plant to see if I could locate the origin, on the ground, of the lights. Not seeing that origin on the ground as I expected when I reached the intersection of Detroit Rd (0.3 mile sound of I-90), my curiosity got the best of me and I turned left (east) onto Detroit Rd. and drove about 0.4 mile eastward on Detroit until I seemed to be pretty directly underneath the lights. I pulled over at Hamlet Lane (a &amp;quot;Private Drive&amp;quot; for, presumably, condominiums), got out of the car, and looked up directly over my head.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was only a few seconds before that point that I realized the lights were not stationary or somehow &#39;anchored&#39; to the ground, but were in fact, moving! They were traveling from a due-South to due-North direction out over Lake Erie (the southern edge of which is about 0.8 miles due-North of my position). And these lights kept appearing from the south (over the treetops) and flying directly over my head. It&#39;s obviously difficult to estimate their altitude, but my best guess would be in the range of perhaps 500 - 1000 ft over my head (although it certainly could have been upwards to 2000 feet in altitude?). At first, I wondered if it was just a whole bunch of helicopters flying in some sort of loose formation (like some sort of squadron), or perhaps small private planes, but they were completely silent! I mean, they did not make ANY sound whatsoever, at least, that I could hear.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I could not make out any actual aircraft, but saw only a white light encircling the presumed craft. Also, they were not traveling very fast, though speed too is difficult to estimate, but it appeared to be a fairly leisurely pace (possibly lees than 100 mph?). From the time I noticed a light in the south appear above the treetops travel north out over Lake Erie, was at least a full minute (or maybe closer to 2 minutes?). But as they flew (or more like, &#39;drifted&#39;) North of my position, there was a considerably larger break in the treetops enabling me to see a considerably larger portion of the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Although I didn&#39;t actually count the number of lights I saw in the sky, over the course of this approximate 4-7(?) minute sighting, I saw what seemed to me like literally DOZENS of lights in the sky north of my position! Perhaps 3-4 dozen at a minimum, or maybe even more than that?!  Fearing that I might be blocking the &amp;quot;private&amp;quot; condo drive with my car when another car pulled in the drive, I got back in my car and drove a couple hundred feet or so west on Detroit, but not before hearing the occupant of the car that had pulled into Hamlet Lane make a brief comment about seeing the lights also and wondering what they were.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Next, I pulled over at the corner of Clubside Drive and Detroit, got out of the car again, and continued to watch as these lights kept appearing in the  southern sky over the treetops, and slowly fly due north. I then heard another car that was pulling into another driveway make a remark to another occupant in the same car, about seeing the lights and wondering what they might be. I replied to them that there were a whole slew of lights flying northward that were completely silent.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I got back in my car, drove west on Detroit, and pulled into the Detroit Rd entrance for the Crown Water Filtration plant observed the lights in the northern sky for another 30 - 60 seconds. Then turning back onto Detroit, I turned left (south) onto Clague to resume my drive home. After turning back onto Clague, I saw only 1 or 2 more lights out of my driver&#39;s window over the treetops in the east. Then they ceased. I kept looking for more out my window as I continued driving south on Clague back home, but din&#39;t see anymore.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A couple minutes later it dawned on me that I should have used the 2 megapixel camera on my phone to try to record what I saw (though there&#39;s no guarantee that my 3 year-old non-Smart phone would&#39;ve been able to capture any images in true dark). Damn!  But for several minutes last night, I most definitely saw a few dozen, low-altitude lights flying silently in a loose formation in a south-to-north direction out over Lake Erie.<n> <n><n> <n><n> For the record, I was not intoxicated in any way (I&#39;m on Methotrexate for arthritis and thus cannot drink at all), and I do not take any mood- or conscious-altering medications whatsoever. While not initially knowing what I was seeing, I did feel somewhat confused, bewildered, or disoriented at what I was seeing. But there&#39;s no mistaking - even remotely - that I did in fact, see a whole shitload of UFO&#39;s! And although I&#39;ve once or twice in the distant past seen a solitary, very distant (star-like) light in the sky that might (???) have moved back-and-forth in an &#39;un-airplane-like fashion) - to which I could not swear - this was as obvious as getting hit in the face with a sledge hammer. I most definitely saw this - I was not hallucinating at all.<n>

Home is located in Fauntleroy Woods.  Member of group said “What is that”?  All looked to the south over the tops of 100’ plus cedars in the neighborhood.  We saw what appeared to be a small object with red and green lights.  They were very bright and similar to LEDs based on past observations I have made of these types of light sources.  The lights appeared to be arranged in a tight square, two green and two red.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Craft came up over the trees and hovered.  After approximately 5 seconds, it started accelerating to the NW until it was no longer viewable, due to the heights of nearby trees.  Our viewable horizon in that direction is approximately 60 degrees and above, essentially a circle of trees.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was clear to all viewing that this was not an airplane, satellite, or helicopter as there was no audible propulsion sound. Night was dead still with no wind.  We see air traffic daily as we are on the flight path for Boeing field (E to W, W to E) personal/private craft and are quite familiar with the sound and sights of such vehicles.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The movement of the object definitely appeared to be “controlled” somehow.  Because of the low light it was impossible to judge size or distance but I would guess it was flying above Barton Ave, or the Fauntlee Hills neighborhood.  Holding one’s thumb out at arm’s length would have obscured it from view.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Our guess was it was some sort of a remote controlled quad copter.  But it did have bright lights and was at a high altitude, 500’ at least.  I am aware that Li-ON power packs are able to illuminate LED light strips and have a friend who does so with radio controlled planes that he flies in North Bend, WA.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We saw one satellite that night and it took the predictable E to W path in a straight line.  It definitely was not the same type of object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About one hour later we saw an extremely bright meteor.  It entered atmosphere directly above us and burned up in bright white light heading due south towards Burien/Tacoma.  It actually left a contrail which I have never seen before in person.  No sonic boom was heard.  That was amazing!  The hover, then transition to forward motion, colors, and absence of sound was what bothered everyone.  All agreed they had not seen something like that before.<n>

I immediately sprung out the door into my backyard to better witness the event,  calling everyone else in the house to join me.  The craft had the appearance of an of orb of fire and moved quietly across the sky.  I watched the object for 1 minute before it could no longer be seen from where I was standing.<n>

I did go outside I heard the panic in her voice.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Upon going out my front door this is what I saw 4 objects in the sky near by my home they looked like red fireballs I was stunned and said what the heck is that I went next door to my neighbors home and proceeded to tell her she needed to come outside and look at this so at this time we were both looking up and saw 4 fireball objects with no noise then they combined into 2 balls then 1 ball and then the light just went out and disappeared. Then as myself and my friend were talking I said look there is an airplane you can clearly here it and see that its an airplane so then what was the objects we just saw?  As we were c! ontinuing to discuss this all of a sudden the fireballs were again flying near the same spot we just saw them in and now they were back to being 4 balls then once again combined into 2 then 1 red ball. I just wanted to report what we witnessed as I am very baffled at what we saw.<n>

Our backgrounds range from behavior therapist to self-employed professional painter to landscaper to vet.<n> <n><n> <n><n> From the south 3 crafts appeared above the tree horizon with blinking lights. The lights went from blinking to a solid orange light directed at us though no light was visible on our bodies.  After about 10 seconds they all turned to blinking lights again and one moved east around us and one moved west around us and one moved directly over us.  No specific shape of craft could be detected as they were too far up.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When all 3 were in line with us above and to the east and west they stopped moving completely and waited.  Then another 3 appeared and did the exact same thing while the original 3 moved towards the north of us.  Then another 3 appeared and did the exact same thing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We saw 9 total crafts at the same time surrounding us in the sky.  Multiple times they would stop and shift directions individually at times and in unison at times.  All 9 eventually moved north out of sight, never shooting off fast but keeping a steady speed and distance. The whole event lasted maybe 17-20 minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.  PD))<n>

We were on a main road, passing by the local reservoir.  He noted that several onlookers were pointing to the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Upon looking where these people were pointing we both noticed 3 orange orbs in a triangle formation.  They appeared to be over the water and were quite high up.  They only stayed this way for a minute or so. By the time we had pulled over to watch them they all had taken off in very different directions at a high rate of speed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At one point one of the craft headed over the vehicle we were in. It was quite high up, as we lost sight of it when it disappeared into the clouds.  One thing which stood out to me the most was that the object&#39;s orange glow was not a light, but the vehicle itself.  It also did not make any sound.<n>

The objects were moving northward, directly towards my building from the south-southeast, one slightly in front of the other, very close to each other.  The orbs slowed, and began hovering slowly towards each other, almost so close that their lights touched. It was at this time that two other orbs, the same shape, size and colour, were spotted heading towards the two original orbs.  The first two orbs turned off their orange lights, and it was at this time my partner and I clearly saw their spherical shape and black colouring. All four orbs hovered together in a unit, moving at times slightly closer to one another, but staying in the same general area.  My partner and I guessed the orbs to be no more than 3-400 metres above us, and maybe 1k away.  The newer arrivals also then turned off their lights after a! few moments. (At least, it looked like the lights turned off - perhaps the light was swallowed by the cloud coverage?).  After a few more moments, the orbs, as a unit, flew straight up into the clouds and disappeared from view.  At no time did we hear them making any noise, and no matter how they moved, we did not see any other shape other than a sphere (no side profile of a helicopter or other plane-like shape).<n> <n><n> <n><n> A report of the event was phoned in to the Waterloo Regional Airport (located very close to the four orbs) but the response was that the airport had not noticed anything unusual.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Drones?

The color was odd.  It was not silver or white but more of a mother of pearl color, may be even a &#39;snow&#39; color.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When i pointed them out to my son and as he started looking for them, we were going down hill and in to the trees.  i lost sight of them.  we drove around the farm fields for a while looking for them, but they were not seen again.  They were 1 and 1&#39;2 times as wide as my finger tip at arms lenght  and about a quarter of the heigth. and had that odd color to them.  Both appeared to be identical.  The one on the right a little higher in altitude<n>

Immediately, he told the other employees, including myself, to all come outside and get a glance of these objects.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I looked up and saw several of these bubble looking objects flying close to the sun&#39;s rays in the same direction.  They didn&#39;t seem to veer off with the wind and it seemed like they were traveling west from our location.  It was a very bright and clear morning, and it was hard to focus on the objects for too long because of the sun.  It was unlike anything I have ever seen before.<n>

White or silver in color, at that time of morning, the sun was just up, and you could tell the sunlight was reflected on one side of the craft.  About 10 times as long as it was wide, angled in the sky like a backslash ( / ).   Myself and other witness observed it for about 5 minutes, never wanting to say the words UFO.  We ruled out all possibilities, then the craft started slowly rotating, so that we where seeing one end of it.  Once it got to this position, it simply vanished.  Did not take off, or move at all, it simply vanished instantly.<n>

As I got closer it appeared to be in the shape of a diamond.  There were 4 lights that I saw. Picturing a diamond I seen one up towards the top two in the middle side by side and one towards the bottom.  At one point I saw the two middle lights kind of spin around each other like switch places.  The lights appeared to be orange in color.  As I approached the intersection of Manley &amp; Lampson the lights were directly above me.  I proceeded to make a right turn (south) onto Manley street looked out my window and realized they were directly above me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I proceeded to the end of the street which was Stanford Avenue at which point I made a u turn and parked my car at the intersection of Manley Street and Lampson Avenue at which point I looked out my window and they were gone.  No where to be found, in the distance or otherwise.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I posted a comment on my facebook page in which a friend of mine who lives near by indicated that her and her husband had seen the lights as well.

Look!!” and pointed at the sky.  There were 3 multicolored lights in a triangular shape in the sky to the southeast of us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> While watching this in amazement, the lights changed shape and became 5 lights in an elongated rectangular shape with a point on the end like a Star Destroyer.  This lasted for maybe 30 seconds and then all of a sudden the lights changed shape again and took on the &#39;classic&#39; cylindrical “flying saucer” shape and started moving across the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After watching it slowly move to the east like this, the lights then changed into a &#39;star&#39; shape, with at least 8 points; I&#39;m not totally sure how many points, but there were at least eight of them.  This object then started moving north, while still in the star shape, moving slowly to the north.  All of a sudden it picked up speed and shot away in an instant still moving north.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This whole incident lasted approximately 3 to 4 minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I would like to say, for the record, I had not had a drop to drink and neither had my cousin, him being only 16 years old.  It was the most amazing thing I have ever seen in my life and I will be looking for this object to come back into the skies above my house for years to come, probably!!<n>

So, we pulled out the telescope and were able to see the lights circling above ground.  We wondered if it could be helicopters circling over a fire when we noticed some of the lights turn bright red.  But the colors kept changing from white or yellowish to red, so it couldn&#39;t have been flames.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Plus we turned on the news and heard no reports of a ire out near red rock, where the lights seem to be near.  At one point 4 red lights appeared to break off from a brighter yellowish white light and scattered in different directions.  What the heck is this?  And why isn&#39;t it on the news?  If it were helicopters, surely they would be news helicopters, right?<n>

The second didn&#39;t begin to move until the first one had move off to what looked like further into space til I was no longer to  make out it&#39;s motion, but just prior to it moving off like I mentioned it seemed to get much brighter than it was gone.  The same thing happened with the second, they both made subtle course changes as well, so I new they weren&#39;t meteors. but the first I can say was just sitting there for 23 minutes before it began to move, I almost didn&#39;t notice it til I began to look at some other stars just to the right! of it.  The second one was actually kind of cluster with 5 other stars or lights but after I&#39;d watched the second one move off I turned to look back at where it had first seemed positions and the other lights/stars it had been clustered near were gone as well, almost as if they had just faded slowly unnoticeably further out to space or just dimmed out.  Also, wanted to note again, the sky here was completely cloudless and clear with no storms passing near my position on any weather maps I&#39;d checked from Accuweather and my WeatherChannel apps.<n>

I made a few steps from the back of my car to follow its way to the horizon, because of some trees.  Then the light made two littel moves on its way to the east and I have to change my viewpoint to follow its way to the horizon.

Several seconds later it shot up into view at about the same angle it had gone down, and it travelled horizontally for about 2 seconds and then went down again at about 30 degrees and I lost sight of  it again behind the house.

I went outside and seen about 10 round glowing red lights that would change to yellow but with some red still in them. They were coming from the east flying over I85 towards I985 then flickering out behind clouds over Buford but not showing up again. Except for 2 that we saw to the west of us that disappeared quickly. However, several more kept coming from the east. I would say I witnessed at least 5-8 more lights that came from the east after the initial 10. These objects did not make any sound. My coworker said there were probably 20 more he saw before I made it outside. There were several aircraft in the sky as well, but none as close to us. These aircraft were distinguishable as they had the typical white flickering light that normal aircraft have. I have film on my phone of the last 3 or 4 of these lights. You can see the lights but barely on my phone.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The aircraft was only visible by the 3 large, round, bright white lights that were evenly spaced in a row horizontally.  The lights seemed to be about 4 times larger than a car headlight with no other visible lights and we could not make out the shape of the body. Just by looking at the lights and how they were spread out horizontally I would guess that the span of the aircraft would be that of the wing span of a 737 aircraft. We saw the aircraft fly very slowly directly ahead of and in front of us.  As the aircraft was on the passenger side of the car, I remarked to my wife to &amp;quot;watch that aircraft, it looks like it is going to land, make an emergency landing&amp;quot;, I kept on saying, &amp;quot;watch it, keep an eye on it....! keep on watching it&amp;quot;.  Then as it came around to the east side of our car and crossed the highway going from the east to the west it quietly flew past and flew around on the west side of the freeway.  We thought it was an aircraft that was coming in for an emergency landing, as it was flying at an incredibly slow speed and very low to the ground.  The aircraft was silent or at least very quiet because we heard no noise as it passed overhead in front of us.  The car windows were up and the radio was on, but something flying that low and slow would have made some noise and turbulence as it passed over, we noticed no noise or abnormal movement of our car from the passing craft.  The craft then flew around on the west side of the freeway, disappeared from view and then I saw it in my side and rear view mirrors, my wife also saw the craft as she turned around to look out the back windows.  It maneuvered slowly and smoothly unlike any airliner, small aircraft or helicopter w! ould appear to fly.  We saw it for what seemed to be approxima! tely 1-2 minutes until we were somewhat farther down the highway and could no longer see the aircrafts lights.  I am an Aircraft Rescue Firefighter that has worked at an airport and around aircrafts for over 21 years and I have never seen that configuration of 3 round, large, equally space bright white lights on any aircraft and It seemed to maneuver like no other aircraft that I have seen flying.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

6/14/13 20:00|Hampton|NH|Sphere|1 minute|Dark colored sphere or egg shaped solid object no lights no sound traveling as fast as a helicopter moving straight 1200 feet overhead|7/3/13|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/098/S98661.html|377|ndxe201306| Dark colored sphere or egg shaped solid object no lights no sound traveling as fast as a helicopter moving straight 1200 feet overhead<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was around 8:15 PM Saturday, June 14, 2013, when my stepdaughter and I decided to go ripsticking around our neighborhood. Ripsticks are similar to skateboards.  The weather was perfect all day and the sky was perfectly clear.  The sun was slowly setting but it was still light out.  I am a 32 year old male and the other witness was my 12 year old step daughter. We rode our ripsticks for roughly 15 minutes then decided to take a break in a quiet neighborhood a few streets away from our house.  She got off her ripstick and sat down in the grass off the road.  I stopped and got off the ripstick and stood in the road simply looking at how beautiful the sky was that evening.  My eyes were quickly drawn to a small dark spherical shaped object appear on the horizon where the tree line meets the sky, around 300 yards to the right of the road.  There was a wooded area, a break in the neighborhood where no houses were built, just power lines running along an open area with ! grown in shrubs and grass and small trees.  The area was about 40 feet wide with power lines right through the middle.  On both sides were bigger trees and denser woods. This object caught my eye as I happened to be looking in that direction of the sky where the sun was setting. By that time it was still somewhat light out, but dark enough for cars to start turning on head lights. Basically the sky was still light in that direction and the ground and street and neighborhood was getting darker. The object was traveling as fast as a helicopter would. I thought it was a helicopter at first, but there was absolutely no sound, no lights blinking, no lights at all. It seemed to be moving in a straight line as if it had a destination heading towards the coast out to the ocean. It was difficult to guess how high it was, I would estimate around 800-1200 feet off the ground. I am not sure how fast it was going, but similar to any airplane or helicopter. It never stopped never hovered, ! just kept going straight towards the coast. It first appeared ! as small dot on the horizon then got bigger as it approached our area overhead then as it headed off toward the coast it got smaller and smaller again. It lasted roughly about 1 minute from the horizon where the sky was brighter from the direction of the sun setting, to the coast where it was no longer visible. We both saw it and we both felt a very strange feeling in our gut about it. Something definitely was not right about it. No sound and no lights. It went right over us. I did notice it seemed to be going in the same direction as the power lines that came out of the wooded area. It was high enough to not be able to make out any details with our naked eyes. I wish I had binoculars at that moment, but unfortunately I didn’t. Still it was very unusual and we could sense it in our guts. Basically it was ball or spherical shape, all black or dark color, no lights, no sound, moving as fast as any aircraft would overhead. It was definitely not an airplane, not a jet, not a helicopter,! not a glider, not a satellite, not a hang glider because it was spherical, and it maintained the same altitude, not a person in a parachute, not a kite, not any bird or any flying animal, not anything that I could possibly think of. This thing had a solid round dark colored egg shaped or spherical shaped body to it. No wings, no tails or fins, just a solid spherical mass floating through the air as fast as a helicopter with no sound, and no lights. It was very creepy.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.  PD))<n>

Then it leaves our view, this was! the most amazing thing I have ever seen, my heart is beating telling the story, my girlfriend is skeptical of UFO&#39;s and alien life but she does not deny we seen something out of this world that day, I told my mother, father and siblings about what we seen and they do not believe us, my girlfriend doesn&#39;t want to sound crazy to my family so she tells them we did see something but she can&#39;t explain what it was, I wish I can take a lie detector test to prove to my family we seen something that day.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.

It appeared to be a plane like the last one, but again, it was moving WAY to fast to be one.  I took a closer look, and it appeared to have rings around it.  The other witness then told me they could not recognize what they where, and we then concluded they where in fact a UFO.<n>

While listening to coast to coast am I was informed that there have been numerous sightings of strange floating and streaking fireballs in the sky across the US, and was stunned by this fact, as my family and I witnessed these strange objects in the evening sky three times.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The first event took place on June 13 at approx. 8:30 pm.  My family and I were driving to our house which is located on one of the very high mountain peaks of the region when my step-Father pointed out a strange floating orange object in the dark evening sky. We were all instantly awestruck as to what this object could have been.  We stopped the car dead on the road and continued to inspect the object in disbelief.  It looked to be anywhere from 1000 to 1500 ft. in the air, and slowly floating in the opposite direction of the wind and cloud movement. It closely resembled a hot air balloon that had caught on fire and had no basket attached to it.  The object was very large, entirely too big to be a Chinese lantern or any other ceremonial object.  The strangest thing about the event is that the object was floating straight across the sky not up or down and was far below cloud cover and this very large flaming ball simply disappeared right in front of our eyes.  That very same nigh! t and approx. 10:30 pm my wife and I were driving home from our parents’ house and once again witnessed this strange object in the jet black night sky.  This was not the last of the occurrences however, three days later on Sunday June 16th we yet again witnessed this event take place at approx. 9: 30 pm.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Although I have spent countless hours researching what these fireballs could have been I am left with nothing but the fact that this has taken place all over the US and possibly the world.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am a Veteran and had spent 4 years stationed on an airbase and have been in multiple combat zones and have never witnessed anything similar to this. My only conclusion is that it is supernatural or extraterrestrial.<n>

I would like to report a UFOs sighting that i have captured using my cellphone (iphone5) camera.  What amazed me after 3 shots that i took, is that I didn&#39;t notice the object at that time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was a terrible weather that day of June 13, 2013.  We are expecting a powerful thunderstorm that day so i took a photo of the clouds forming just above the yacht. Powerful lightning was experienced that day cutting electricity 4-5 times all over 4-5villages.  It was not a plane nor a helicopter, it was totally different.  I tried to zoom the image and did some color changing just to figure out exactly the shape of the object using an enhancement application in the phone and i keep on having a dark shade beneath the object itself like a source of heat or something.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Some could argue that it&#39;s a clouds forming shapes which i thought it was but clouds cannot do a triangular shapes.  i do have a photo of clouds making a circular shapes but! triangular shapes with almost perfect straight line that is a bit &#34;impossible&#34;.  The second object can also be seen at the far right of the photos and it appear from the first photo until the last and it appear to hover or move up and down base on the object different positions.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am sharing this genuine photo just to hope that someone out there may enlighten us to what exactly this objects.<n>

And within 5 mins a ((obscenity deleted)) plane or something similar took off from the water and slowly went diagonally to somewhere............!!<n> <n><n> <n><n> I sat out there for 2&amp;1/2 hours and the ((obscenity deleted)) I saw was ((obscenity deleted)) amazing...  For example : a yellow sphere appeared for a second then multiplied its size&#39; left a big bright light and disappeared.....  I counted 5 strange lights that I thort were stars that just started moving fast it&#39;s like they were hovering but moving like it was doing 600ks in our atmosphere, these lights were appearing randomly and started flying, some were invisible for 2 seconds then lit up and repeated untill they were gone.....<n> <n><n> <n><n> They wernt shooting stars they wernt some logic explanation and I wasn&#39;t on drugs haha...<n> <n><n> <n><n> I don&#39;t ((obscenity deleted)) ((care)) what anyone thinks I know what I saw, something happened last night out there.  Who ever belives in that Jesus clown I hope you change your mind on what to belive.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;m still spinning out, I can&#39;t belive this ((obscenity deleted)) but its legit.....

We had a major storm blow thru the region earlier that day, which caused power outage, so I was able to look at the night sky and see the stars.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was no cloud cover, and dont recall the moon being out at the time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was looking in a northernly direction when I viewed these 2 orange colored lights traveling together in a straight line.  What struck me as odd was they stayed in a perfect &#39;formation&#39;, one never led or fell behind the other, it was if they were &#39;attached&#39; and moving across the sky at a pretty fast rate of speed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They seemed to be at a high altitude, as I watched them, I viewed a lower flying conventional aircraft traveling SE to NW, intersecting the lights&#39; flight path below them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I watched the lights travel across the viewable sky for about 10 minutes until I lost sight of them behind trees in the south.<n>

But soon after noticing it the light become larger and larger until it appeared to be twice the size of a full moon through partial cloud cover and then stopped growing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first I wasn&#39;t sure what to think of it so I ran inside and grabbed my significant other.  I pointed out what I was seeing and she told me that maybe it was the moon.  I told her there was no way the moon was that far northwest at the current time (11:30ish PM).<n> <n><n> <n><n> I proceeded to go back inside grab my phone to confirm using Google Sky Map the current location of the moon as it was cloudy outside and we couldn&#39;t see the moon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We then got on the computer and looked up luner cycles to get further clarification on the moons current location.  I went back outside to take a photograph and it was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I then ran back inside and told my significant other it was gone and we both stood outside in disbelief... I should have taken a picture as soon as I noticed it... I dont know what I was thinking.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My first confirmed sighting of something odd and I was more in shock and trying to disprove what I was seeing I guess.  I won&#39;t let that happen again and will be spending more time looking up.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The best way I can describe it was it glowed like the color of sun but twice as large... partially behind cloud cover.  Blew my mind.<n>
6/12/13 23:02|Louisa|KY|Other|2|Flying stars?|7/3/13|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/098/S98615.html|392|ndxe201306| Flying stars?<n> <n><n> <n><n> I stepped out to my patio at 11:02 PM eastern time.  It&#39;s completely dark with no street lights within 700 + yards.  It is a completely clear and calm night and the stars are bright and easy to see.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I live directly beneath jetway J8 or J6 at (30*07&#39;26.27&amp;quot; N) (82*38&#39;18.90&amp;quot;W) and noticed 5 airliners in rout heading south west away from my back door like always approximately 35,000 feet give or take 5,000?  So I know at least 1 or 2 of these airliners should have seen this also.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I&#39;m standing out back looking southwest watching the airliners fly over and I noticed to my left a really bright star only that star is moving then I noticed it somewhat began to dim to a dark blue then got bright as a landing light  Then dimmed to the color of a normal star then dark blue again where I all most lost it and Repeated this sequence 4 more time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As all this is happening I&#39;m trying to put together what am i seeing?  First I thought it was a plane then satellite and maybe it&#39;s the sun hitting it under the horizon and then it got to my 2 o&#39;clock and just Instantaneously stopped and blended in with the surrounding stars!!!  I didn&#39;t take my eyes away from it for over 30 seconds and it was just sitting still then I started to question if I was still looking at the same thing doubting I really just saw what I saw so I started to scan the sky again to try and regain sight of it.  Then another light that looked like a landing light caught my eye at my 11 o&#39;clock taking the exact same path only faster It seemed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Now this is where it gets scary. When the second one gets to the point where I lost the first one that blended into the stars The one I lost brightened back up and instantly matched the second ones speed and directly fell in behind the second one and followed it out of sight and seemed to change directions to the north east?  The colors I noticed were star white. Dark blue and bright halogen bulb yellow like a landing light or reflection from the sun off something metallic.  They were the exact size of a normal star just looking up at night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This all happened in under two minutes and guessing if it had been continuous it would have crossed the horizon well under a minute.  The airliners take 3 or 4 minutes from the time I can see them directly overhead.  I could hear the airliners overhead but not the lights I were seeing.  They had to be well over 70,000 feet if they were even in the atmosphere at all?<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;ve had a pilots license 20 years this November So i have a little knowledge of what I&#39;m seeing when I look up and I&#39;ve never seen anything like what I saw last night so if anyone could please explained to me what I might have seen please feel free to contact me I&#39;d love to hear your theory&#39;s.<n>

With Binoculars and Spotting scope it looked to have a rotating Blue/Red/Green light around it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first it did not seem to be moving.  Then it started moving North and appeared to be heading lower in altitude but it could have been that the distance change made it look like a drop in altitude.  It seemed to be sphere shaped but also may have been slight egg or oblong shaped.  At 60x it wasn&#39;t easy to discern the exact features.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Also strangely earlier in the day around 1pm there was a military jet that took off from Glacier International airport and flew toward the West.  It was reported as flying sideways and flew fast enough that it shook buildings.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was thought to be a Harrier but that&#39;s not confirmed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

I thought it was something falling from the sky.  At first glimpse it looked like a plane crash or something. I quickly pulled over to continue watching the action.  When I looked back into the sky, the fireballs were still there.  The scary thing was that they were not falling.  They were flying across the sky from the west to the east and moving the same speed as a commercial airline would, only, the fireballs appeared to be flying at a lower altitude than a commercial airline would (hence the reason why I may have thought they were falling at first glimpse).  They were however flying at a higher altitude than a helicopter might.  The fireball in the leading position was flying about 30-60 ft. ahead of the other three.  The three following all seemed to be mimicking the lead fireballs movements.  The firebal! ls moved from Right to left in an arch formation, stopped, and then shot from that stopping point about the same distance as the arch in a diagonal line from bottom to top.  The other three fireball were about 10-20 ft. apart from each other like they were playing follow the leader.  This all happened in approximately 1-2 minutes and then they continued on east until unseen.  The leader was almost already unseen while the other three were still making the formations. It was a very exciting and interesting experience.  I have never seen anything like it before.<n>

I was driving on Upper red rock loop road when I noticed lights flashing and blinking over the mountains.  The lights were quite bright, but not of any color, simply flashing light repeatedly blinking at no specific interval.  The lights were too close to the ground and stationary to be any commercial aircraft and too strong to be any sort of road vehicle (Road work, comed etc)  There was also no pattern to them.<n>

Baker, Washington, on the night of June 12, 2013.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This report was submitted on another UFO reporting site, but I heard you on Coast to Coast AM last night and thought I should submit it to you:   The evening in question we were called by our daughter to look at what she called a &#39;spaceship&#39; seen from her patio. We arrived at about 10:15 at her house in the Glacier Springs subdivision near Maple Falls, WA on the night of June 12, 2013. Through her telescope we could see an orb flashing rotating colors in a grid pattern.  It was seen over the mountains to the right of Mt. Baker, looking SSE from our position.  The orb remained stationary while we observed it for about 20 minutes.  We left and our daughter continued to watch it until around 1:30 a.m. She went to bed at that time. It remained in the same position and continued to produce an incredible light show.  It would have been in the same general direction as Marysville or Everett. It was hard to determine the diameter or exact shape of the orb as it appeared to be some distance away.  It could have been 20 to 50 miles away...if so, that would mean that it was quite large.  Nothing made here on earth could produce such incredible light for so long and hang so steadily in one position.<n>

At an altitude of 150 to 200 feet.. Approximated of course because I had nothing to reference it to.  The lights would  appear and disappear.  I had my phone in my hand waiting for call and I took a chance and took a photo of the lights.  I looked at it later and have been curious to what it is. I saw them one more time and then they disappeared all together.<n>

I take care of my elderly father after he broke his hip,he saw the lights to.  He has also seen them on other occasions.  We both seen them one more time it was only one but it stopped dead stayed there for awhile the just blinked out.  It was gone just gone and never came back.  My cats seemed scared.  They where real jumpy I could not even pet them for a couple hours.

This is to the south, towards Clayton/Mount Diablo, to be exact, over a closed  Military installation shut down after WWII.  At first glance it looked like a plane from afar, but when I looked back it was GONE.  No jet trail, no trace of anything, just plain gone.   What was strange was how sunlight seemed to really glare off of the aircraft, almost like a material I haven&#39;t seen before, which is why I took the second glace.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Within 20 seconds I checked radar, I have live data provided by FAA that I pay for, there was NO aircraft anywhere near.  It was moving to slow to be a jet, and dissapeared way too fast to be human, couldn&#39;t be a military craft because the base has been closed for decades.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Two weeks later, I saw it AGAIN.  This time I was walking my dog, and didn&#39;t dare take my eyes off of it.  I shouted to a neighbor I had noticed was across the street to look, and we both watched. This thing dimmed out like a light burning out, is this evidence of manipulating time to propel craft at Godly speeds?  After it, disappeared into thin air, in complete shock, I went home, not wanting to stick around a second longer.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About 15 minutes later, a military style helicopter, which during my twp years I have lived here, have never seen.  It circled the area for a good twenty to thirty minutes, as if  looking for something.<n>

I have had several sightings of lights around my truck gate I work at during night shift.  Even as I stopped typing this report to check a truck in, I saw another light.  The sightings are usually during dusk to midnight and usually happen every night.  They are usually seen near the top of the mountain that over looks highway 6 and the valley, and this mountain is located just north of our truck gate.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I came in to relieve the guard before me, he was telling me about these lights he has seen, and right when he did, outside on the mountain, a light started shining right where he says he usually sees it.  He left and I continued to watch this light as it turned on and off, faded from red to blue, dimmed and got brighter then occasionally shut off and turn back on and go through these phases randomly.  The light did not more or change positions.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Later as I was watching the other side of the night sky and I looked up and saw a bright white light, silently and slowly move across the sky.  I was looking up at about a 70 to 80 degree angle from ground to sky.  All of a sudden, it dimmed and dimmed, then disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I think it would worth investigating these mysterious lights in the Utah mountains.<n>

A forth red light then appeared as the second faded.  Then, the third faded, soon followed by the fourth.  They were all evenly spaced from one another, seemingly on the same craft, which would have been enormous.  This was also during a lightning storm which was also over the distant ocean, but miles to the South.<n>

My mother-in-law (age 70) was also present. We were watching lightning from a distant storm out at sea.  Out over the ocean, about 20 degrees above the horizon, we began seeing blinking white lights.  They looked like stars but they were moving erratically and blinking.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After a few minutes, a bright orange orb appeared, and remained steady for several seconds then faded away.  This scenario repeated itself several times and at one point one of the orange orbs split into two and moved apart in a horizontal direction before fading away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At the end, we saw what may have been two aircraft leaving the area and heading west.  They were blinking, but moving in a steady direction.  Any sound they may have made was drowned out by the sound of the surf.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We have witnessed this same phenomenon (the blinking lights and orange orbs) at other times in the past while at Oak Island, most recently last summer while at this same location with other family members.  We have witnessed the orange orbs on at least two other occasions from Oak Island during the past three years.<n>
6/11/13 21:48|Burgaw|NC|Fireball|5 seconds|Once in a lifetime sighting of a large metor like object that impacted the earth.|7/14/13|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/099/S99876.html|413|ndxe201306| Once in a lifetime sighting of a large metor like object that impacted the earth.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was blessed with the privilege and honor to observe the crashing down to earth of a large spectacular meteor type fireball.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Super large about the size of a pool table ball by comparison in size as seeing it come down from the night sky via my car windshield.  It did not disintegrate like a falling star does.  It burned bright and was an exhilarating sight to behold!  It had very little trail burn off at all.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was very concerned there was going to be a shock wave as it came down like lightning!  I braced myself for the worst but never heard any crashing sound nor anything that it did as it absolutely had to have hit the earth intact somewhere nearby.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I called the Burgaw, NC police department and reported it within twenty minutes of the crash when I got home because I can&#39;t say what exactly that it was or could be and I felt I had better report it as it could be something significant that was not to be just kept to myself.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I do know it came from space and not the skies right above us as I witnessed it come crashing down like a falling star does in a blinding speed streak but it held together to the tree tops very large.  I did get a follow up call and explained in depth the encounter.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The rains we have had has made the area very flood riddled and the sod mushy.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I assume it went into the earth but had to have initially made quite an evident entry mark at impact.  Since then it has continued to rain exceedingly unusual and there may never be any evidence visually to be discovered.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I wonder just what has been deposited in the ground of this area and what will be the results from this space implant.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I can tell you that it was the most awesome sight to have witnessed!  I still feel like it was a very special gift from God to have been the witness to it even if it were only a hunk of a junked satellite.<n> <n><n> <n><n> To see that scene was beautiful and eerie.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was out of this world!<n>

I looked directly south about 20-25 degrees over the horizon to see 3 orange orbs in mid-air.  I watched for approximately 15 seconds to see if they were moving then pulled out my iphone.  My phone&#39;s camera wasn&#39;t able to focus on the objects, they then disappeared.  The objects did not move, rise, or fall, they were stagnant, then were gone.<n>

As soon as I looked up, there was a shinny silver sphere underneath the plane and continued to hover as the plane passed by.  It then driftet southeast slowly, then to disappear instantly.  Which is very strange as the object seen was very clear, then to vanish within a blink of an eye<n>
6/11/13 17:45|Frederick|MD|Cigar|5 seconds|Reddish-Brown Cigar-Shaped Object Flies Over Frederick, MD.|7/3/13|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/098/S98573.html|417|ndxe201306| Reddish-Brown Cigar-Shaped Object Flies Over Frederick, MD<n> <n><n> <n><n> I saw a cigar-shaped object flying fast across the sky, about 1000 - 2000 ft in the air, moving into Frederick from the SSW heading northward.  I noticed how fast it was flying and then realized that it didn&#39;t appear to have any wings like a plane.  I thought of it being a plane or helicopter or drone aircraft, but it moved fast like a fighter jet, but there was absolutely no sound.  The craft was a reddish-brown color with a gray front end, ironically like a lighted cigar.  I watched it until I couldn&#39;t see it any more behind a building, but about 10-15 seconds later, I watched a commercial plane taking off into the sky from the Frederick airport, which was apparently larger and the wings were noticeable.  I watch numerous aircraft flying through this area on a daily basis and nothing flies like this object did.  My location during this sighting was just south of the Westview Regal 16 theater.<n>

It was thundering outside but no rain or lighting. Suddenly my father screamed out from the deck &amp;quot;COME OUTSIDE NOW!!!&amp;quot;.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I ran outside and he pointed up at the sky. I looked up and saw four rapidly (but randomly) flashing lights in a line.  My dad and I began asking each other what it could possibly be, as we were doing so the four lights shifted from a line into a rectangle in about 30 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> These flashing white lights proceeded to move closer to the ocean at an exceedingly rapid pace.  Once they reached the ocean, lighting began shooting off from only the cloud that the lights disappeared into for about a minute.  Shortly thereafter there was no lightning, no thunder, and the clouds began to clear away.<n>

Saw three steady, non flashing, lights proceed in front of trees in our field, across neighbor&#39;s field, then behind trees.  It was cold and raining and too early for fireflies, which flash and jump around.  This was steady.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
6/11/13 02:30|Fort A. P. Hill (military reservation)|VA|Circle|3 minutes|Super fast silent object over military base with high mobility.  ((NUFORC Note:  Military report; night vision devices used.

We all had night vision goggles on and our weapons of course.<n> <n><n> <n><n> But around 2:30 am a semi bright object was seen through the trees high up, the same height a jet would be.<n> <n><n> <n><n> And it took off traveling at a crazy speed faster then any F-15 or F-35.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then just changed directions without flipping and went back the other direction.  Then it went straight up then down.  After that it took off and disappeared.  It appeared an additional two times traveling at the same high speed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In terms of speed it went from my 150° to my 300°  &#34;150°-0°-300°&#34; in about 2-3 secounds at about 50° in the sky traveling parallel with me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Every one that was on security saw it, but i was only able to confirm it with 4 of the 12 that were on guard.  None of us heard any sound with it.  It looked like it had an IR strobe light on it, but I took my NODs off and it was still semi visible.<n>

The light then flashed bright orange and yellow about 20 feet above a field and then was no longer visible.<n>
6/11/13 01:30|Woodbury|MN|Circle|35 minutes|Circular silver object in the sky that moved, "shot bright lights" and disappeared and reappeared.|7/3/13|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/098/S98561.html|422|ndxe201306| Circular silver object in the sky that moved, &#34;shot bright lights&#34; and disappeared and reappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Appeared as I woke up.  Was very bright, would move up, down, side to side then it would return to a specific position in the night sky.  Sometimes you would see another light being &#34;shot&#34; from the main circular object.  (This happened about 3 times)  Then the light would die down but you still could see it, then it would brighten back up  (It did this for about 25min)  Then before it disappeared you could see smaller lights being &#34;shot&#34; from the circular object in the sky.<n>
6/10/13 22:30|Toledo|OH|Light|45 minutes|Star like objects|7/3/13|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/098/S98597.html|423|ndxe201306| We spotted 7 &amp;quot;star like objects &amp;quot; 4 going south to north,2 east to west, 1 north to south.  Once again these seem to be following the path of the northstar,and as usual they head north towards Michigan/Canada.  The ones traveling east to west also are very close to the north star.  All were about 5 minutes apart,and at different speeds.They look just like a small star,and can travel very fast  to a slow pace. No other blinkng lights ever on these.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Last night 06/11/13 we only saw 1 in about a 20 minute time frame.  Most nights we see them every 5 minutes,sometimes not so many even with good visibility from time to time.  These objects would be traveling almost parallel with I-75 and I-80 when going east /west.We less than a mile from I-75,and maybe 1.5 miles from I-80.<n>

The object was orange/red in color, with no discernible blinking lights, and maintained luminosity throughout the duration of my obervance.<n>

They were there for about 6 seconds (hardly enough time to tack a picture) and then they were gone, just disappeared in a streak of light that lingered for hardly one second.<n>

I have witnessed several sightings with my family and wife.  It&#39;s almost if they follow me around.  I finally decided to help with disclosure and to bring some more awareness.  I feel behooved to send in this report.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I often star gaze and it seems that this area I&#39;m living in does have an extraordinary amount of sightings.  Due to my knowledge, I have a keen awareness to recognize this type of event.  I am a pilot, and served with distinction in several squadrons on board the U.S.S. Midway, Ranger and Enterprise.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At about 8:00 p.m. looking up at my 12:00 high, I witnessed a very brilliant white gold flash. It appeared, and I&#39;m almost sure it was outside the atmosphere in low orbit.  However, I considered it may have been a stellar event such a Nova explosion.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then a minute passed and four consecutive, flashes followed.  At this point four solid lights illuminated, and they went in formation from NE to SW, to where they disappeared at a moderate speed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Several more flashes occurred through out the evening followed by a formation traveling at an extremely high altitude.  They were not aircraft nor satellites.  A period of non event took place until what seemed like a meteorite shot over my house at and altitude aprox. 1000 ft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have seen lots of meteors and this just caught my sight.  Never have I ever seen anything move at this speed.  I then realized that what I saw, was a vehicle of the size of a moving van, with a flat bottom, smooth top akin to half an egg shell.  This sloping was gradual from top forward forming a cutting edge.  It sped by and I observed the vehicle warp and stretch length wise when it vanished.  This event astounded me!  It happened faster than I could blink.<n> <n><n> <n><n> To follow up, today my wife and I witnessed five huge mother ships enter our airspace surrounded by and into massive cloud formations.  These ships were round saucer shaped with large dome structures on top and bottom center.  I&#39;m speculating my previously sightings were vessels belonging to these larger ones.<n>

At first sighting they appears to be  an antenna.  After looking into the distance in the UFOs direction @ 21:00 there were not a single flashing light which would be present on a radio or any other antenna.  Around 11:00 06/11/2013 UFOs still present.  Around 13:00 the said objects disappeared from sight.<n>

Silent. Might have discharged very small sparks.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was about 10:50pm EST. My wife and I were walking outside to her car, as she had to go to work and I was seeing her off.  I looked to the west and saw a yellow-orange light in the west, heading east, coming towards us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first I thought it was an aircraft, possibly a helicopter, as there is a trauma flight helo pad a couple blocks away and it was moving at a slow rate of speed.  But there was no noise. I then pointed it out to my wife.  Then we both thought it might be meteor, as is did seem to be flaming and shedding very small sparks.  The sparks were few and very small, coming both from the rear of the object, as well as the sides toward the rear.<n> <n><n> <n><n> But the sky is overcast (rained all day) and the object was below the cloud cover.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object wasn’t perfectly round, nor oval, nor did it have a long tail. It did seem to have almost a “bullet with wings” shape, as it passed more sidelong to us, like the flame was forming some kind of small “wings”.  They weren’t wings, but the flame, the closer it got, spread out in a short winged shape  The object seemed to curve to the NE.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It appeared to be a deep orange as it went out of sight to the northeast.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I did run to grab my camera and have it on video, though not sure of the quality.<n>

It was a clear late summer / early fall evening.  Out of the North flying South was a bright flying object. It took me a couple of seconds to realize that if wasn&#39;t a jet or an airliner.  I was between 9 - 10 years old. I was and still am a huge science fiction fan. It wasn&#39;t the USS Enterprise or a Klingon Battlecruiser.  That would have been cool.  This was better!  The object was roundish to almost egg shaped. It had window&#39;s all around the sides. But only in the middle of the craft.  But they went all around the craft. The craft did spin but it also spun from end to end. If it had ends.  Hard to explain. There were no other craft in the sky. I was so enthralled it didn&#39;t occur to me to wake up my parents.  Looking back the object probably would&#39;ve been gone by the time my folks would&#39;ve gotten out of bed. Well! that&#39;s my story from my only UFO encounter of my life.  I&#39;m now a former US Army MP and a 3 time OIF veteran.  I&#39;m now a civilian police officer at Fort Sam Houston.  Also 80% disabled by the VA. Very glad you all have given people a forum to put down their UFO  experiences.  Good luck on your continued endeavors.<n>

We thought they were just meteors  until we noticed they began to change speeds and started juking left and right.  At this point, my friend and I called out my girlfriend to come witness it, but she thought nothing of it and went back inside once the lights proceeded to fade.  A few seconds after the 2 red orange lights faded, 2 faint white lights (almost appeared to look like a far-away star) appeared where they had disappeared and began to move rapidly in an upwards direction.

It was so beautiful and amaze. Whoever was outside of their house in my area must have seen it.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I arrived at my friends house and as he was walking down the driveway to meet me I tol d him to look to the sky.  He reported the light was moving without stopping and stoped suddenly with no movement.  He stared for about 30 seconds and he said it faded outward towards space and dissapeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We both looked to the sky and nothing was there.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am not joking and I feel like it followed.me and knew we were seeing it.<n>

I didn&#39;t think anything of it, it just looked like a star.  Then all of a sudden it moved really fast.  I grabbed my co-workers shoulder and pointed it out to her. A few seconds later it disappeared.  It did not look like anything we ever saw before.  We discussed for a lengthy period of time what it could have been, and could not find any answers, I concluded that it must have  been a ufo and she agreed that we had both seen something we could not explain.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

Objects moved at  speed as would a jet airliner.  Objects showed no blinking lights or normal aircraft lights that typically are seen.  Distance between objects varied but in general formation heading towards same path towards west and climbing to higher altitude and then faded away. Estimated time is approximate at 22:00 on 6/9/13.  Initial observation altitude (elevation above the horizon) would be about 20-25 degrees.  Objects viewed from South Windsor, however, event origination estimates could be locations from East Hartford/Hartford northwest area.<n>

I wasn&#39;t the first witness, a friend was laying in a lawnchair and was able to point it out and I had time to completely turn my head and watch for what seemed to be a long 5 seconds.  Sounded like there was a faint crash in the distance afterwards.  Many things ran through my head, ultimately I can say it is un-identified.<n>

I walked over to my door to close it as it was slightly open letting a draft into the house.  But, when I got to the doorway I decided to step out onto my balcony real quick and when I looked over the town and toward the pier, I noticed about 3 to 5 glowing orange orbs floating in the sky.  I immediately sensed something peculiar about the objects and quickly grabbed my cell phone to record the event for confirmation that I was actually seeing floating things in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The objects floated very slowly, two of them moved down toward the pier and downtown area and one slowly rose into the sky.  They were small orange orbs, and moving very smooth and effortlessly.  No Sound.  As I watched the objects, I tried to talk about what was happening in the camera as the footage was very low light and actually quite terrible.  However, it does show the glowing orange orbs flickering in and out.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I watched the one floating higher into the sky, the two lower orbs seemed to just disappear. Then, moments later, the one in the upper sky disappeared just as it was about to float over my head at about 300 feet above me. I almost felt like it was looking at me or knew I was there somehow...like the feeling you get when someone is staring at you from behind and when you turn around, there is someone looking right at you. It had that same feeling of connection.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After the incident I saw two neighbors and showed them the cell phone footage I captured. They said it looked like Chinese lanterns that float with a flame and heat and are made of paper...which made sense as I&#39;d seen these items before but didn&#39;t think about them at the time I recognized the objects...so I wrote off the whole experience.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A couple weeks later (today), I was listening to a rerun of last nights Coast to Coast am program and the publisher of this website (ufocenter.com) said people around the country were spotting Chinese Candle like UFOs!!! I re-examined my footage on my cell phone and it looks like what he was explaining!! So here I am, writing to you about a similar experience that happened in one of California&#39;s smallest beach towns, approx 2,000 people....<n> <n><n> <n><n> I still don&#39;t know what I was looking at but I have the little video on my cell phone if anyone would like to see it.<n>

Identical conditions in regards to low cloud ceiling.<n> <n><n> <n><n> First event, early 2013.  Time approximately 19:30 Looking south towards Miami two orange lights slowly moving east to west. Altitude approximately 250 feet. Distance approximately 1/2 mile. Continued in a western path for five minutes until lights disappeared into low cloud ceiling. Witnesses 3.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Second event, June 09 2013 (If I remember correctly).  Time approximately 21:20 Once again, looking south towards Miami 15-20 lights moving west to east.  Altitude approximately 500-700 Ft. Distance approximately 1 1/2 - 2 miles. Although objects were not uniform (IE: triangle), they did not deviate from their own close proximity. If these objects were indeed chinese lanterns then someone had connected them with some sort of string, rope, or cordage, thus allowing a somewhat uniform appearance and movement. As an ex service member I can ensure these objects were not flares, as these object maintained their altitude for approximately 10 minutes before disappearing into the low cloud ceiling. Witnesses 2  Third event, April ? 2013. Looking north from same location. Time approximately 1630. Conditions partly cloudy. A white/light anomaly appeared (other witnesses claim seeing two side by side before I had come outside). Very very strange. Although anomaly appeared close, and conditions of full daylight, I could not gauge distance or altitude. Certainly not low level clouds reflecting sunlight. Still try to rationalize this event in my mind, but I cannot. When reflecting on this event it almost seemed like a dimensional anomaly. I honestly have no way of explaining this event rationally. Witnesses 4  I did not take down exact time, wind, or cloud ceiling conditions because, frankly, I never thought I would be filing a report on them. After hearing a report on Coast to Coast on 25 June 2013 of many events, I figured I should at least make a report on these events. This is coming from someone who has never witnessed any event prior to 2013, so to have 3 events in less than 6 mos is very odd.<n>

They passed an area of woods and looked in the rearview mirror of the truck and saw a glowing effervescent light shining in a circle (about 50 yards across) behind them.  They stopped the truck in the middle of the road, exited and walked to the rear of the vehicle.  It was a blue/grey colored light with an amorphous texture. The light went from ground level to slightly above the tops of the trees, and appeared to be circler, almost as a huge bubble.  There was no sound or odor, and you could only see about 10ft into the light.  There appeared to be no source above the light, however, it was difficult to see past it.  It was a clear night, no inclement weather that evening.<n>

The sky was pretty dark, and the object was coming down in a slower motion then a falling star.  It looked like  natural gas blue color, and it was coming down in a slight vertical position from the north west sky.  It lasted about 3 to 5 seconds, and it was as big as a volleyball from a far distance.<n>

I ran outside and saw a very bright, orange light that seemed to be glowing brighter at it&#39;s center.  The light was about 700-1000ft in the air approximately 1/2 km from my position.  It seemed stationary, enough so that I took the liberty to run inside for my camera.  When I returned the &#39;light&#39; was diminishing in size. Perhaps not extinguishing, but moving away rather quickly.  My sister, her husband, myself and finally my father were witnesses. Naturally, I was unable to capture it on film.  We&#39;re still discussing whether it could have been a chinese lantern.  We all agree the light was not bobbing and was definitely stationary at times.  The wind presently at Oakville, Ontario is from the NE at 13km/h.  The object was moving from east to west.<n>

Then there was a series of singular lights in what appeared to be a straight path for about 10 minutes.  There was no usual aviation lights and did not have audible sounds. There were no trails, just a constant &#34;burning&#34; light on every object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am not sure what this was would of dismissed it as some science experiment but I have a friend and my father who was in the Korean war kind of perplexed as to what we saw.

They all appeared to be going in the same direction at the same rate of speed.  It was weird because we could see planes and their lights were blinking, but these &#34;stars&#34; were lit only by the glow of the moon like regular stars were, no blinking lights at all and going much faster than planes fly, it only took 30 seconds for them to fly by and disappear.<n>

These objects were so noticeable and obvious I literally noticed them out of the corner of my eye while looking towards my dog on the ground.  I immediately pulled out my iPhone and began to video tape what I saw.  As I video taped I noticed that the objects were not completely stationary but were very slowly moving in what appeared to be my direction (sw) yet increasing in altitude at the same time.  They can be best described as amber colored, yet bigger and closer than (in earths atmosphere) regular stars in the sky that moved very slowly.  As I filmed I noticed they would move closer towards me, gain altitude and they would randomly fade out one by one.  As they were fading below them through the trees I kept seeing more appear sometimes 2-3 at a time that were much brighter at they&#39;re lower alt! itudes and seemed to fade as they climbed in altitude.  These objects made absolutely no sounds, and moved in no erratic motions, yet didn&#39;t have any characteristics of any man made aircraft I have ever witnessed.  In all I saw/video taped around 20-25 of these at first bright glowing objects that would eventually fade away and be replaced by more almost immediately.<n>

Then it just looked liked a white ball getting smaller, and smaller like a star, and then it was outta our views? Wow!  It&#39;s very trippy to see something like that in the night sky with 2 other witnesses including my self which makes 3 of us total!<n>

I live in the Level Green, Penn Twp area.  My front porch faces north towards Cheswick, PA. which is across the Allegheny River at 11.40 miles.  The lights appeared to come out of the north eastern sky over what would be Plum-Monroeville, PA about 3.54 miles over the tree tops.  They flew towards my house and angled to the right over the valley and all disappeared one by one in the same place over the PA Turnpike.  They were observed for five (5) minutes.  Then another one appeared over the same area but flew perhaps, 2 miles further and disappeared over the Lyons Trail Court area.  No sound made.<n>

There were about 12 lights coming south and 3 trailing.  She said they came up out of the tree line and thought they were fireworks at first.  The lights traveled south then they turned and went west.  They went through a thin cloud and disappeared. We heard no rumble of an engine or propeller.  There was no sound from the formation at all.  I was able to get a few pics. but there are trailing lines in these lights because I could not hold camera still.<n>

A flashing caught my attention in the sky in the distance east of my location.  It was an extremely shiny metallic object that kept moving, catching the sun&#39;s reflection.  At first I thought it was a Mylar balloon, but I realized it was not moving in the wind, it was stationary.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I went into the house to get my super-zoom camera.  I went back outside and it was still in the same exact spot.  I took numerous photos at 700mm over a period of about 15 minutes even taking the time to change settings on the camera.<n> <n><n> <n><n> One photo shows it turned into a blob, and then it returned to the boomerang shape.

When she did decide to turn and look, the object started to move eastward, slowly at first.  It started to move out of view, blocked by a tree.  I moved to relocate it, but it was gone.  I did not see if it just disappeared or moved quickly, but it was gone in a hurry as I only had to move a few steps.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

There were clouds out tonight so it could not have possibly been stars or a planet.  I can identify a helicopter or airplane from the numerous vehicles I see almost daily in this area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was silent and was below the cloud deck, but the size was extremely large.  Giant in fact.  I&#39;ve never seen something so large and distinct in our sky ever.  I am truly touched, enough to write this note tonight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Each light was equidistant from each other and faded out quickly.  One light went out and then the other 2 went out at the same time and not a Chinese lantern.  I&#39;ve seen them before as well.

I then noticed it was flashing at a consistent rate of about one second.  My mother, 2 children of 11 years, and I saw this most of the way towards the I 71 exchange.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I decided to take 71 north to figure out what was going on since I had never seen anything like this before.  Going north we could see that it was stationary, in the air and not one of the airplane towers, which had red lights and were lower down.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At the 39 exit, I turned around and headed south.  We were better able to see the light source. It was wide, round and not very tall in comparison to its width.  The lights went around in a counter-clockwise manner, so that it looked to be flashing.  The lights were white with a slight blueish tint, which is why I mistook it for lightening.  It was several miles east of 71 and too low and stationary for a plane, but too high to be something from the ground.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I don&#39;t know what it was, but was a bit freaked out because I had never seen anything like it. The children couldn&#39;t sleep for hours afterwards because they were freaked out as well.<n>

There were a number of sightings that occurred in 2009 and some intermittent sightings throughout the past 4 years.  The first sighting I personally had was in June of 2009.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The sighting I am about to speak of was very brief, lasting only 5 minutes.  Ever since 2009 there has been an increased military air presence with planes flying overhead all day and night.  The air traffic has become somewhat normal so I wasn&#39;t shocked to go outside and see a plane.  However because the UFO&#39;s have tapered off since 2009 I was rather surprised to see a small bright light (not a plane, no running lights and considerably smaller) tailing the plane at several paces.  What was even more interesting was seeing the very large ball of light trailing the plane and the smaller light at an even greater distance.  This light had no running lights and was very much like the UFO&#39;s I and others had seen throughout 2009.  I was unable to gauge the shape or size of these ships due to how high both UFO&#39;s and the military craft were flying.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I would also like to add that on 6/03/13 another family member watched a large stationary light (she thought it was a star) suddenly start moving quite rapidly upwards until it disappeared.<n>

Lights were not in an exact formation, there were some in a cluster towards the north end of the whole group. My daughter and husband stepped out of the front door on the east side of our home to take care of some chores, they noticed the line of lights in the sky moving west, on the west side of Weatherford, Texas to the East side of Mineral Wells, Texas. until they could no longer be seen. (approx. 5-8 minutes) The lights did not flash and never heard a sound.  No type of engine noise.  We stayed outside just watching the sky for another 5 or so minutes, and that is when we noticed and low flying pulsing light, the closer it got it almost looked like many lights within one sphere. It moved slow enough for us to focus on but fast enough to be moving on, only took about two to three minutes to move in past our home, just to the south of our home ! over our neighbors pasture.  It was higher than the tree line, but not as high as a helicopter would fly. This light also made no noise.  There weather was clear, no clouds.<n>

6/7/13 21:30|Overland Park|KS|Sphere|~10 minutes|~10 nonuniform red orbs over Overland Park- A cluster-spread within cluttered airspace w/ plane, 2 jets & stars.|7/3/13|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/098/S98589.html|489|ndxe201306| ~10 nonuniform red orbs over Overland Park- A cluster-spread within cluttered airspace w/ plane, 2 jets &amp; stars.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On 06/07/13 @ ~9:30pm, I was driving southbound on I-35 from 75th St. towards 87th St. and admiring the extremely decorated/illuminated 87th St. overpass.  I then noticed high in the sky just to the left of the overpass (just south of HEI) a cluster of red illuminated orbs (aka &amp;quot;Fireballs&amp;quot;)... Instantly thinking it was either part of the color-lighted overpass (off the side), or more likely several cell towers with red lights, or helicopters, or balloons, etc...<n> <n><n> <n><n> So, in order to rule-out the bridge first, I cruised underneath it and clearly passed it.  And then I immediately realized it wasn&#39;t even cell towers because they always have a flashing red light up top and always red lights inline vertically and with a visible tower.  There were no towers in sight and I even double-checked the next day. These red orbs were slowly cruising/scanning SW in a nonuniform cluster-spread... Not too low, and not too high.  There was a grouping of ~5 or 6 in the leading cluster, and then three more following in a curved boomerang shape, and one loner following way behind (the runt of the herd??).<n> <n><n> <n><n> So, I next had to try and analyze/rule-out military helicopters (~10 red orbs) because they too move slowly/horizontally across the sky at quite an altitude.  So I quickly pulled the car off to the side of the highway on to the shoulder, with flashers on and windows down for the duration.  I didn&#39;t hear one helicopter, let alone a handful... And zero tails/wings/props, or port/starboard/taillights.  I also easily ruled-out ten horizontal asteroids or ten flares because they weren&#39;t losing altitude in a downward motion with fiery trails, and clusters of balloons don&#39;t fly at night in airspace cluttered with air traffic (I hope).<n> <n><n> <n><n> In one big visible sky zone, I could easily compare them to all the white stars in the background as well as one little red/green lighted plane in the distant background (up above and to the left), and another chem-stream plane on the other side, above and to the right.  Instead of trying to photograph or get poor quality footage on my old phone, I was far too mesmerized/fascinated and wasn&#39;t about to take my eyes off them and possibly miss something (like bolting at mach-20!).  Glad i didn&#39;t too... They slowly but surely, one by one, faded/dissipated/vanished~ Not shutoff like a light.  Almost like traveling up/outward at a high rate of speed, but they didn&#39;t get any smaller.  And btw- Pilots never shutoff their red/green/white port/starboard/taillights, unless monitoring/engaging.  Especially a cluster of ten, one at a time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After well absorbing the big picture for several minutes, I stared at a couple individual ones and could barley see a slight twinkle on the outer circumference rim of the sphere~ not sharp edges ( o ), but fuzzy ( * )... Like all the &amp;quot;Fireball&amp;quot; descriptions on the internet (I googled &amp;quot;red orbs in the sky&amp;quot; and fortunately found this NUFORC website).  After noticing them slowly vanishing before my eyes (rats!), I stared at the last unit pulling up the rear until it faded away too... And I saw it fade to a dark circular silhouette (cloaked) while continuing to cruise at the same speed and in the same direction (camouflaged).  And I&#39;ve seen how the military is capable/practicing this tactic now with tanks, etc... And speaking of~ Right before they all vanished, I also barely noticed for a split second an air force jet at the same ~altitude (without lights) heading them all off at an angle in the same direction (SW towards Olathe)... As if stealthily monitor! ing/escorting them from a distance with lights off.  The military is well known for practicing this safe maneuver every chance they get... After all, they are in &amp;quot;their&amp;quot; airspace with an air traffic control nightmare near airports.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was truly hoping a policeman would pull up behind me... Or some other witnesses nearby.  I did call four educated friends and explained to them in detail... I explained what I witnessed and that it was all undeniably unidentified to me, and asked &amp;quot;what do you all think they were??&amp;quot;  Since then, I&#39;ve drawn a color picture and explained details to a dozen other educated credible people... All unexplained and baffled.  Later that night, I called the Overland Park police dispatch on Santa Fe... Hoping for other witness callers.  I didn&#39;t get mocked (while connected), but it&#39;s a known fact that they&#39;re trained to discreetly deny any/all info as not to create panic.  They all have nothing to gain and everything to lose... Especially astronauts, pilots and air traffic control.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After about a decade of researching ufology with countless credible documentaries containing footage/testimonies of ALL levels these days... For the past few years I have watched the night skies whenever possible... Hoping... Someday... For just a glimpse.  That entire image/experience is permanently burned into my memory.  I personally didn&#39;t even need a poor quality photo to thoroughly convince me... And that also spares me of all the redundant mockery/ridiculing accusations of photo-shopped hoaxes.  I don&#39;t need any of it.  I finally got what I wanted and needed... Peace of mind.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was a fairly clear night.  Suddenly we both saw a bright orange object move low across the sky, from SW to NE.  It was flying lower than a plane or helicopter.  It seemed like an active flame (as in a fireplace) contained in some sort of transparent round, or cylindrical container.  The fire was extremely bright orange in color.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My first thought was that it was some sort of roman candle, but there was no sound at all, and the object kept moving across, not down.  There was no tail.  We guess it was moving 35-40 miles per hour, and seemed to be about 200-300 feet above us.  The size, to our eyes seemed to be about about 1 foot x 2.5 feet in size, at the distance from which we saw it.  It was low enough that I worried it would set fire to one of the tall pines. After about 7-10 seconds, it went behind trees so we couldn’t see it any more.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Neither my husband nor I have ever seen anything like this.  I might describe it as a sort of flaming orange Japanese lantern, except the orange flame was intensely bright, and like fire, not an electric light.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Noticing things that looked like stars but moved allot faster, I thought of satellites.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then I noticed one that caught my eyes because it was noticeable brighter and larger than the others.  At first it moved fast then very suddenly slowed down to a cruise at this time it grew brighter.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The light then changed directions multiple times in a zig zag like path, changing speed randomly to very very fast to extremely slow.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then continuing its path with lots of speed stopped suddenly and on a dime.  For about 20 seconds it sat there pulsating in brightness. The light then flew randomly (straight at a moderate speed the changing directions fast.)<n> <n><n> <n><n> It then stopped and began to descend, going fast down then topping almost as if in a car you would hit the gas then slam the brake repetitively.

They were cylindrical in shape and although extremely bright, the light they emitted seemed to be not glowing, but just...there?<n> <n><n> <n><n> They really looked like glow-sticks suspended in the air.  They were large and looked the size of a mini-mall.  One bright pink and the other blue.  Like giant horizontal day-glo tubes in the night sky, and they made no sound at all.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Even though there are no cities or heavily populated areas near the sighting, this was so big and unbelievably “in your face”, I find it hard to believe not more people have reported this sighting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My friend saw them too but won&#39;t discuss it because she is so freaked out.<n>

I observed  a rather Silver Colored Flying object, which could NOT have been a Bird, in Jerky Motion, fly Out &amp; Away from the Building,  Not Hovering, but seemingly getting ts Bearings&#34; then, with what appeared to me, [ as a former Model Remotely Controlled Airplane Enthusiast] similar to Radio Remote Controlled Aircraft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had a Nikon Point &amp; Shoot Camera, but could not have caught the Silver Flying Device, the Sun being contrary &amp; the Rapid Take off.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The devise at a point of approx. 15 Yards Out from the Building then Very Rapidly Gained altitude above the Roof of the Building, and orientated itself to a Northern Flight Path and was Quickly beyond vision.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The &amp;quot;Towers&amp;quot; Apartments [I am not naming it] is Quite Tall, and the Area where it departed from, is a Rather Tight enclave on the North Face, which is the Rear of the Building.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am Former M.A.R.S.

I thought to myself, I should get my flashlight and flash them twice.  When I thought this they flashed me twice, on the second flash it faded out slowly like an opera light.   Which tells me they could read my thoughts from a distance, which amazed me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> But on the very next night I was awakened at 4:00 AM by bright blue lights coming from my full length dressing mirror on my bedroom door.  And out of it came 3 weird creatures with long arms and fingers waving at me as they came towards me.  I threw something from my night stand at them and they went back into the mirror.  Then I had an implanted thought that they were dimensional travelers.  I watched my mirror turn with clouds and blue and white bolts of lightning coming down in it.  There were mountains and clouds behind it all.  Then it dissipated.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Ever since then I have a severe case insomnia and sleepwalking and do weird things when I am sleepwalking.

It was warm night and mostly clear.  I saw what appeared to be a satellite, and watched it as  it moved in a path towards the north east. It as a white weak light, only slightly brighter as a star, and moving faster than I would expect a satellite to move.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There were no blinking lights visible so I ruled it out as plane.  A satellite also seeded unlikely as I am close to a major metropolitan area with some light pollution present.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What caught my attention that made this object unusual to me was that as it moved across the sky it appeared to have a slight wobble in its flight path.  I wasn&#39;t sure if what I was seeing was correct, so I tracked it&#39;s movement relative to several other &#34;stationary&#34; stars and it did indeed seem to have a wobble.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I eventually lost sight of the object after it passed over some trees in my neighbor&#39;s yard.<n>

During the last 3 years I have compiled over 600 photos of the Spheres in the daylight, in the very city of Mostar (my city) – I have something like 60 different sets. I know what they want.  I do not want to stay anonymous – I want people to know. I will send those photos and some texts to your organization on that email. I can send all since it would last too long.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My photos and parts of texts are published on different UFO and other web sites, magazines and I do now even know where else.  A few weeks ago I got contacted from one ufologist from Germany – he is also going to publish some of the material in his book.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am the first to take photos of the Spheres doing transformations in the air. I have photographed them in black, translucent, yellow, red, orange… I knew even before they had done those transformations that they are polymorphs.  I am connected with them. it is not what you think, this is completely different. They are here for us. They are ok.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I know what they want – they want to wake us up, it is already here.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Strange things are happening around me and it is accelerating. I can do some things with nature. I was not born this way – I was told by them that I am a Pleyadian. I do not know – everything is possible. I do hear voices in my head. There are some strange characters surfing the web. They are all super-intelligent. They even know what you had for a breakfast, although they are in a completely different state and your web cam is completely disconnected from you computer. you can ask them what you want and in one second you get completely correct answer.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I want people to know – we are not this what they say that we are. I was threatened with life for my work a couple of times. I am starting to get psychic abilities.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They are responsible for all my photos and this start of awakening. I am here simply with them. They are cool and I really like them. I am just a human, like all of us – although this cannot be happening.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was born in a city environment and I have never had almost any interest in ufology. It was simply something for me to pass the time by watching a show or two per month on Discovery or Nat Geo. Nothing else.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is really happening.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am going to put here my nickname and my mails – if somebody is interesting to read those several texts and see some photos – not a problem.  I guess that I simply have to do this.  I hope also that some serious researcher simply might take this seriously enough and ask me a few questions.  He would not be the first one.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is how it is. Once one highly esteemed ufologist told me that we are going to be famous because of this – I told him I am not interested. I got in touch with him here – abovenbeyond2011. He is the only one who has all my photos and texts. This is happening. At least it is not boring to me. Maybe I even am from Pleiades and maybe I am not – I do not know and more or less do not care – this is all simply to interesting. I am having the time of my life.<n> <n><n> <n><n> And one more thing – it has been a month that when I am angry light bulbs simply die around me. Maybe it is just a coincidence and maybe it is not – I also do not know and do not care. And the nature is getting to be something special – I am starting to feel the life in everything around me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> All the best to all of U.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Senna Bosnia and Herzegovina senna.xy@live.com<n>

It was moving in a peculiar manner - meandering through the sky - instead of cruising, drifting or cutting through the air like an airplane it was meandering through the sky - not moving straight - I tried to film it with my phone camera but the contrast was terrible and barely anything was showing (I tried the camera indoors afterwards and everything was very dull in a lit room - I only just acquired the phone and don&#39;t seem to be able to get the camera working properly) - as I have successfully telepathically communicated with ufos before I went through a lot of things to send to it in my head but wasn&#39;t sure what to say, and didn&#39;t feel like it would have too much impact anyway for whatever reason, I! am mainly filing the report to help track local ufo activity as another time when I saw one at 200 feet or so there were a lot of reports from the islands around here of glowing craft in the night sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Really it just meandered through the sky moving with that strange &#39;lightness&#39; that they do until it was nearly out of view behind a tree - then I ran up a hill to get a new vantage point to watch it for longer but couldn&#39;t find it again after that.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I feel a bit gutted that I &#39;wasted&#39; my time trying to film it as it was closest to me at that point and I was mostly looking at my flippin phone haha - oh well .<n> <n><n> <n><n> At one point there was an airplane clearly visible (near the end of the event) and it was interesting to note that the lights on the plane looked tiny compared to the light that was the ufo - roughly speaking the width of the ufo was equivalent to the size of the plane - roughly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was very excited to watch it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Will keep watching as I saw five last night - not as close as this one - they were like satellites but not moving straight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This one and last night&#39;s were all star like in colour.<n>

I was standing outside their front door with my Father in law at approximately 10:45pm.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Through a ‘V’ in the tree line (looking towards Mt Snow’s direction) we both saw a large bright white orb appear and move very slowly across the sky from left to right.  It was about 30 feet above the tree line and below the clouds. It appeared to be maybe 20 feet in diameter (best guess) and glowed pure white.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As we watched it we started trying to determine what it was.  Our first guess was fireworks as it was the day after the 4th but there was no flare to the light it just shined a solid white like a super bright LED lantern.  It also seemed to move too slowly to be a firework or an aircraft and there was no sound at all. As Wardsboro is in a Valley usually you can hear things such as thunder and planes louder than you normally would bu! t this was pure silence.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After about 5 seconds it approached a low dim star and it disappeared by quickly fading. My father in law and I continued to ask each other what it was we just saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As we were discussing it we saw another identical white orb appear in the same spot the first one did and it also moved at the same speed, direction and path and disappeared where the original one had.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After the second orb faded we could no longer see the dim star that was in the direction they were heading.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After researching online there is a chance what we saw may have been ball lightning however I am not sure that they appear in pairs like that.  I have also read that ball lightning cracks loudly when it disappears and we experienced silence throughout this.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The only other detail I would add is during the first orb&#39;s travel I felt an odd &#39;fluttering&#39; sensation in my back.  Their front light was on and there were large flying insects around it so I assumed it was a large flying insect that was flying into my back or had gotten under the back of my t-shirt for a minute but it almost felt like a mild spasm.  I was reaching around to brush my back as I didn&#39;t want to take my eyes off what I was seeing.  I am not assuming this has anything to do with what we saw I just want to make sure this is a full accounting.<n>

Flashing was very bright and continuous.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Object moved quite rapidly across the sky, overhead and slightly to the south.  It moved from east to west,northwest.  It appeared closer than a commercial jet but made no sound whatsoever.  It made a gliding /floating type of drift through the sky but was definitely propelled forward quite rapidly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The night sky was calm and clear, stars were visible.  We watched the object for about 2 - 3 minutes.  Flashing remained consistent as did the direction and speed of the object.  The movement reminded me of a helicopter, however, the lack of any sound was not consistent with a helicopter.<n>

They were not much higher than treetop level. I hurried up and pulled into my driveway and grabbed my I phone so I could film it/them .<n> <n><n> <n><n> I started filming and three of them turned the lights off and changed formation.  At first I thought it was a low flying aircraft but was shocked to get out of my truck and not hear any prop noise/ rotor blade noise or jet engines AT ALL!   the front two lights in the formation remained on.  all five of them flew off toward the south-east out of sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> we are not alcoholics nor do we use any type of drugs.  we were absolutely clear minded when we saw this.  im so glad I was able to capture this on my I phone.<n>

When I got there those 2 were gone, but as we were talking another object appeared from the Southern sky and proceeded to move across the sky headed North with no sound.  It appeared to be pretty large round glowing orange object.  It never stopped and disppeared over the horizon in the North.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We stood around for awhile hoping to see another one, but did not.  We did however see 2 helicopters flying from the South head North within a few minutes of seeing the object.  We could not tell if they were military or not as it was dark and they were pretty high in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A little later as we were still standing outside looking a neighbor from down the street came by in her truck and asked us if we also had seen the lights.  She also had seen the lights and was wondering what they were.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have no idea what I saw, but I can say I have never seen anything like it before in the sky.  I believe my neighbor had some type of picture on his iPhone.<n>

6/5/13 21:00|Bryant/Benton|AR|Light|5 minutes|Six orange colered moving lights above Bryant,  Arkansas on 5 July 2013 at approximently 21:00|7/3/13|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/098/S98461.html|515|ndxe201306| Six orange colered moving lights above Bryant, Arkansas on 5 July 2013 at approximently 21:00<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was driving home after getting gas in my car at a Shell station in Bryant, Arkansas.  I was driving westbound on an access road running beside Interstate 30.  It was a clear night and half-way between exit 123 and 121 is when I observered these lights.  There were 6.  They did not appear to be flying in an symetrical formation but did stay together all but one which headed off to the southeast and appeared to be descending.  The color of the lights/objects was a shade of Orange I just can&#39;t put into words.  The other lights/objects seemed to remain on their course which from my vantage point was south.  They actaully flew/hovered over me as I was driving and I pulled over to keep watching them.  The color and intensity of the lights never wavered.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have watched a lot of UFO shows on TV and was always waiting for that ah ha moment when they figured out it was a plane, helicopter or other aircraft.  To be honest what I saw sent chills all through me and even as I wr! ite this, I hope it can be explained but as it stands now it cannot.  After the sighting I called 911, I don&#39;t really know if it was fear that motivated me or just plain curiosity.  The 911 operator took the information I gave down and proceded to call the FAA.  I asked if I could call back and see what they said and she gave me their direct number.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After about 30 minutes I called back and they were still on the phone with the FAA in Little Rock and the FAA told the dispatch officer there were no radar hits in the area.  Shortly after my first call an off duty police officer saw and reported the exact same thing to 911, at the present his location of his sighting is unknown to me.  These lights as I was reminded by an authority on lights are difficult to gauge distance and size so I will try to use the surrounding enviroment as a reference.  First glance I would have said the size of a hot air balloon at what I estimated at about 2000 feet above ground level but since the objects appeared to be just light those esitmates could be way off both in si ze and altitude.  Their movement was constant and slow except for the one I previously mentioned.  I have never witnessed any event like the one I just witnessed in my life.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Whatever it was is to me a true Unidentified Flying Object.<n>

I asked my wife if she could see it and she responded that she could.  It was moving much like a leaf falling from a tree, but much slower, descending in altitude.  We wondered if it could be a plastic grocery bag that had been lifted by a dust devil and then caught in a thermal updraft as can sometimes happen. Then it slowly stopped and appeared to hover.  We wondered if it could be a weather balloon at this point.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then it slowly made a looping maneuver and again appeared to hover in place for a few moments.  At this point I asked my wife to run in and grab her birder binoculars so I could take a closer look if this thing wasn’t going anywhere.  She ran into the house.  During the time she was in the house the object began moving slowly to the! east.  There is a church steeple in the field of view and the object passed behind that. I walked across our yard to get the view from the other side.  The object appeared from behind the steeple slowly moving eastward toward a patch of fair weather cumulus cloud. My wife appeared at this time with the binoculars and I managed to get a glimpse of the object as it began to disappear behind these clouds. In the binoculars it appeared to me to be a tube or cylinder, silvery and sparkly in nature, perhaps with flashing lights running along its length, and it reminded me of a short flute.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Something else that was very interesting, but perhaps coincidental. There were two airliners flying in our field of view at altitude leaving contrails. As I searched and waited to see if the object would appear on the other side of the clouds, which it didn’t as far as I could tell, another smaller aircraft leaving a contrail was flying at twice the speed of the airliners out of the Northeast toward the area where I last saw the object enter the clouds. Could this have perhaps been a military aircraft attempting to intercept the object? I don’t know but found it very interesting. At this point the clouds closed in on the area of my observation and nothing else could be seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am a non-traditional student approaching my degree, the founder and president of a 501(c)(3) non-profit corporation and my wife is a special education paraprofessional.<n>

Even tho, in past instances I have seen evidence of other encounters.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Anyway,  I had just laid down to sleep after watching tv on my computer.  I was in bed and I was awake when I saw a bright red light come through my window which faces the east on the first floor of my home.  It was an intense red light which I have never seen before.  It shone through my blinds into the room about 5 or six feet on the ceiling and walls.  I had a feeling that I should be asleep and then they were gone.  I have two one story homes behind mine and a two story so it would have had to been close to the ground. I was not sure if I should get up or not..so I waited to see what would happen then the light was just gone.  No sounds, no animal noises, not even my ac unit was running.<n>

I always look up into the sky at night upon going outside out of habit as I am an amateur astronomer.  I immediately looked up towards the south.  As soon as I did I instantly see a very bright orb in the sky headed from north to south.  I caught it roughly 10 seconds before it passed below the treeline.  It was not moving particularly fast.  It was very bright white with hard to make out edges almost like it had an aura surrounding it.  It appeared to be an orb in shape.  I also believe there was a slight tinge of blue light near the center of the mass.  All light being emitted from the object was bright, solid, and completely encompassing the entirety of the object.  I ruled out a meteor as it was moving too slow and was way too large.  I do not believe it to be an aircraft of any kind as aircraft have much smaller lights which typically blink as well as it did not produce any sound at all.  It also could not have been a satellite as it was producing its own light as well as being much too large again for it to be that.  The background of the night sky was completely clear if I recall correctly.  I was too engrossed with the object to pay much attention to the sky itself.<n>

We first thought it was a helicopter.  It was making a strange sound like a subwoofer. We looked out the window and saw an object flying at an eerie pace.  Unlike anything we had ever seen. It had many different flashing lights.  Again we thought it was a helicopter but it had no propellars. Also helicopters don&#39;t move like this.  After A minute or so it disappeared behind a few trees.  After this we ventured to the roof top where we saw 3 of the same craft in the distance.  They looked like airplanes but did not move like airplanes. They also hovered for extended periods of time and were going back and forth and up and down over the Mississauga area of toronto. They also became blindingly bright when they seemed to be turning. They are still flying around but it became too cold and we came inside. From our bed we heard the noise again and went to the window to see the same craft travelling east before falling out of sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Observers were ((name deleted)) (local business owner) &amp; ((name deleted ((business deleted)) manager)<n>

We got up and tried to look out our window we couldn&#39;t see anything so we went out back and looked at the sky..<n> <n><n> <n><n> We didn&#39;t see anything right up above even though the sound sounded like it was above or very close to the house.  We looked to our left and down the street.  We saw the UFO hovering near the next street over near the street light.  It was very bright.  The light coming from it was white.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It hovered there for a good 2 minutes.  We had it on video but the phone it was on was stolen sadly. The weirdest thing was how fast it disappeared.  It went faster than the speed of light it was gone within a blink of an eye.  I have never seen or heard a sound like that ever before.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After I watched the video and the way it hovered was like nothing I know of that the USA or anyone has invented.

It was approx the brilliance of two planets seen in the night sky together.  It got a bit brighter as it moved, left to right in our vision, and had NO blinking lights.  It moved parallel with the ground, left to right, then (slowly) it dimmed, dimmed, and it was gone. We had previously seen planes in the area and they clearly had blinking lights on. This was just a large massive light, uniform in its shape, roughly that of a &#34;light&#34; or &#34;star&#34;. To say it was an orb is too specific. We saw the same thing days before (like 3 or 4 days can&#39;t remember) but it was way up in the sky, like where a satellite would be. So I just ignored it as a possible satellite. Yeah,its not a satellite. Also saw a small sprite like light (white -VERY WHITE- and about the size of your hand, f! lies very fast)that appeared right after the encounter. I had seen one of these (5/31/13)but I wasn&#39;t sure what I had seen. This time (6/5/13) my neighbor saw it with me, thank goodness. It was like a probe whipping by us or something. And I might as well say it. I think this phenomenon is psychic. I really do. Sorry, I know thats really not what anyone wants to hear but one of these things appeared when I asked it to (5/15/13). Cheers everyone. If you are in Virginia, keep your eyes planted on the Northern Sky.<n>

The light looked to be about 5mm across from my current altitude of 4620ft.  There was no sound and it was moving slowly from West to East originating from The Spray Lakes area.  At one point, after it had passed over head, it appeared to hover or change direction to the SE as it stood still in the sky for a good 15-20 seconds then continued off to the East.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Frantic  I quickly hung-up on my wife - I took some quick pictures with my iPhone as the object was over head and even attempted to get some video as it hovered to the SE. The object was too high to be a helicopter and had no red or green wing or rotor lights.  I feel the inclusion of the hover or change in direction rules out the ISS or a satellite, also I have seen the ISS and satellites many times and this was too low of an altitude and the size too great to be either of them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have posted an original unedited picture I captured to my Google Drive and it can be viewed here:<n> <n><n> <n><n> https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B1nvmKVaxG72TVVsdnRZeWdQMEE/edit?usp=sharing<n> <n><n> <n><n> On a copy of the image I was able to enhance the shadow and highlights to reveal what looks to be a round disk shape (seen as a black ring blocking out the sky behind it) and a thin secondary, yet broken, halo of light that I can only assume is from light being emitted from the top of the object.  It is the most compelling UFO photo I have seen to date and if I hadn’t seen it with my own two eyes, I would still find the images very hard to explain with any known craft in the skies today.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The shadow and highlight enhanced photo can be viewed here:<n> <n><n> <n><n> https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B1nvmKVaxG72UzRSai1NRkNpZEk/edit?usp=sharing<n> <n><n> <n><n> Again I retain full copyright on the two images I have provided and as such they cannot be copied or reproduced in any way without my knowledge and signed written consent.<n>

No sound was heard, we did not see aircraft strobes, and it was the brightest light we&#39;ve ever seen in the sky at night.  Much brighter than any aircraft.  It was possibly a cluster of lights very high in the sky.  It was higher than the landing aircraft en route to Seatac we normally see.  We feel like it was high enough to be just below the satellite altitude, but it was entirely too fast, too large, and too bright to be a satellite.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Absolutely no sound, and very bright white light.<n>

When observed with the naked eye it appeared to be an orb and had a glow or haze that changed color.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It also sporadically changed speed, as well as color.  The lights would change position and almost appear to be playing tag with each other (making it seem as though each light was a singular entity only to join back together horizontally or vertically before flying off)  The bars of light that shone bright twice, and directly across from the 3 of us witnesses were bright white/blue and  did not change color.<n>

I was observing the skies as it was a completely clear night and the area does not see many stars due to light pollution. I was fixated on two lights in the sky in particular when they started moving.  Initially, I thought that they were planes, but one object started to glow very brightly with white light.  These objects were travelling at approximately 120 miles per hour.  The object closest to the atmosphere started to dissipate and finally vanished.  The second object was still bright at this point but started to get dim.  Once it dimmed it came to an immediate halt, waited a second or two, and shot off toward space, with seemingly dull red &amp;quot;taillights&amp;quot; on what i assume was the back of the craft. I have never seen something violate the laws of physics as in this instance. I spotted the Lights in the southern region of the ! sky and watched as they traveled toward and disappeared over the western sky. I am unsure of what it was flying through the sky that night, but I CAN tell you that I have lived next to airports my whole life, being able to identify civilian, commercial and military craft without question. This was none of these things. No sound, very strange maneuvers. They were about 1 to 1.5 miles high, about 2 miles away from my location.<n>

She said there were 5 of them and were floating without moving and were in a V formation.  When I got outside they had moved behind some trees but I saw them as the moved past the trees.  They looked to be at least half a mile away but she said they looked much closer when she first saw them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They were glowing in a dull, warm orange color and looked be round.  They were not super bright but were quite visable.  My first thought was that they were Chinese lanterns that someone had released but they were drifting south and I checked a local weather website and it said that the wind was north northwest that night (as it almost always is here) so it doesn&#39;t make sense that they were Chinese lanterns.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After a few minutes they drifted further behind trees and buildings so we could not see them.<n>

The aircraft that fly in the area are much higher. There was no sound. It changes course quickly and smoothly.  No flashing lights. The night before when we witness this, there were two aircraft to the west.  They were civilian. They had their strobe lights on.  This object had none. I live in a wooded area and could only see the object until obstructed by the trees.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am a retired Naval Flight crew and have seen many aircraft.

Brighter than any normal lights.  I grabbed my camera and began taking photos for more than one hour. I quit while it was still there thinking I must be crazy and thought I would go out in the morning and see some sort of pole with a light on it, or other rational explanation. But there was nothing. Many photos came out just blank and others are extraordinary.  I ended up with about 50 that show the formation of different shapes, splitting apart and coming back together, and in the photos it appears to be farther away and sometime closer. But to  my naked eye it never moved, only pulsated. I shot video as well but that only captured a flashing light and a hint of changing shapes and colors. I have seen similiar footage of that online. It is the still photos that really captured actual images and shapes. I h! ad to suppress my flash as when I used that I just got a blank screen, so the photos show the lights with a black background as it was dark. I&#39;m not sure who to have look at my photos as I believe no one has ever captured what I did. Video doesn&#39;t capture it.  I still have the photos on my camera and cell phone camera to prove I did not alter the images in any way. Any suggestions of who is an expert to have look at them?<n>

I walked into the woods and when I came back all 6 of us saw 4 amber lights in the sky.  They appeared to be in the shape of a trapezoid, but then shifted in a triangle formation, with 2 of the lights on the bottom coming together.  Shortly after, the 2 lights on the left faded out, followed by the other 2 on the right.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We have video of it as it has already been posted on Facebook and shared on my Facebook account.  I believe that if I had brought an infrared camera I may have been able to see the 4 lights as I believe they may be boosters.  The technology on this thing was amazing though.  The the way it moved showed it had anti-inertia technology.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I just wanted to report this information and hope that it gets passed on to Bigelow Aerospace for review.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;ve noticed in other UFO reports and videos that a lot of them represent a similar shape, the triangle.  I also know that that symbol has been seen on many artifacts found all over the world that are 10,000-12,000 years old.<n> <n><n> <n><n> If you look in the video, it looks like there is a very faint beam connecting the 2 lights with each other on the left and a separate beam on the right pair as well.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I spoke with another witness from near by and determined from the direction she was looking and the location she was looking from that it was about 400 yards away.

I then looked back to see at least two red lights and one white light in the triangular formation. I continued to look as it stood still for 5-10 seconds and then moved up and over until it had moved it was upside down, 180 degrees. We then entered the roundabout and lost sight of the lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then again heading up Widerson street from Hasting River Drive I spotted the lights in the same formation, lower and closer to us, almost as if following behind us, motionless for 10-15 seconds before moving slightly closer. Panic kicked in so my female room mate and I stopped looking.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We arrived home, in the area of Widerson street, calmed down and asked my male room mate who was driving the car if he had seen it. He didn&#39;t for the obvious reason. 5-10 minutes past from arriving home and my female room mate peered out the curtain of a window facing west and again the triangle patterned lights where there, not more than 75 meters away hovering low, this time my female room mate, my male room mate and I saw it, although our other male room mate was in the room but did not see the UFO. It stayed motionless in the sky and by the time I got out my phone to capture the UFO on camera it had vanished.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My female room mate believe that from what she saw the UFO may have been bell shaped but she could not see the top. My male room mate and I cannot describe the UFO with any further accuracy than the three lights and their formation. One thing all three of us agree on is that the UFO made NO sound. Unfortunately my female room mate and I forgot to bring our phones in the car and my room mate who was driving didn&#39;t think to pass his phone to my female room mate or I.<n> <n><n> <n><n> All three of us have spiritual beliefs close to spiritist. We have recently started a non-processed foods diet and we all have been making major life/career decisions the last few weeks. I meditate daily and recently have been researching zero point energy generators as well as electromagnetic gravity modifying devices and space crafts. When meditating I often ask guidance in the workings of these devices. I have also been creating &#39;energy centers&#39; in our home to amplify our bio-electromagnetic fields (some people may not know anything about energy centers etc so just skip that if you want.)  The night before we witnessed the UFO I had an extremely lucid dream in which I was in a house, white light pored in from the windows and a tall and &#39;lanky&#39; grey being entered the room. I felt no fear just excitement and curiosity as it approached. It seemed to communicate without physical sound. I conversed with it for what seemed like hours before it left. The dream then speed forwards to the next night. My mother was now also in the house with me as the same thing happened with the light poring in the windows. My mother was scared for my safety as I walked outside into the light. Nothing dramatic happened, once more I conversed with the same entity outside  and I asked my mother to come out side and meet this being, whom I felt I had known for a long time before meeting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As mad as this dream sounds I had to include it into this description as I feel it may be significantly related to the UFO sighting. I would like to ask if the person who reads this, weather or not it is put on the website database, could post their thoughts on the website and maybe any concerns you may have to convey about the intentions of the entities for which the UFO may be a part of.<n> <n><n> <n><n> From what I gather, it seemed as if the UFO was looking for something, or possibly following after something bellow.<n>

As a big fan of aircraft, I tend to check for traffic in the sky.  At 17:35, I looked up and noticed two white craft, one behind the other and slightly to the starboard side of the leading craft.  At first glance the two craft looked military.  Then I noticed how they looked more rounded at the nose which then made me think that they were drones.  This made a lot of sense because the two craft were moving fast relative their altitude.  If they were at a higher elevation then their airspeed would have been pushing supersonic and there were no subsequent sonic booms.  I estimate that these two craft were around 1000 - 1200 feet.  They were traveling from north to south near the I-65 corridor.  The sky was mostly clear, warm, humid, around 85 degrees with a light SE wind.  The two crafts were out of view in under fifteen seconds.  I made a point to try to listen to the noise produced by these craft.  Am! idst some background traffic and neighborhood noise, I could hear a slight whine that would seem to be associated with a turboprop engine, but much quieter.  The event ended and I thought that I had witnessed my first domestic drone flights- nothing more.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Only until a few minutes ago did I think that I &amp;quot;only saw two drones&amp;quot;.  Media outlets in Huntsville, AL are now reporting a mysterious radar &amp;quot;blob&amp;quot; echo that appeared on multiple radar products over the Huntsville area this afternoon, exactly over the northwest corner of Redstone Arsenal.  Here is a link to the current radar blob event: http://valleywx.com/2013/06/04/mystery-blob-over-west-huntsville/  Huntsville is about 117 miles north of my location.  Maybe these were simply drones returning to Eglin AFB after an exercise in cloaking.  Needless to say, the event that I witnessed in conjunction with media reports about a radar blob with Internet chatter of ongoing C-5 activity was enough to make me share this with you.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

As a result, I thought I was looking at a remote control model airplane or a bird.  The object was very dark against a fairly bright sky, below a scattered overcast. The object appeared to be very low over the distance treetops when in view, but momentarily vanished and I thought it went down below the tree line or the horizon.  I could not determine how far the object was laterally, from my position.  There was nothing behind it that it crossed to get a distance estimate.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I looked down to my sandwich and when I looked back up to the same location, (which was to my northwest), I saw an object, roughly spherical in shape, very dark, which began an immediate vertical ascent.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What put me into a sudden &#34;What the hell&#34; moment was that the object was moving straight up and pretty fast.  I leaned down toward the dash and crooked my neck to watch the sphere continue its vertical ascent as it kept going until it reached what appeared to be the cloud base (the cloud ceiling).<n> <n><n> <n><n> At that moment, the object then stopped moving and held stationary at the cloud base.  It remained stationary for approximately 2 minutes.  It could have been moving slowly to the right, or perhaps the clouds were moving slowly to the left, but after about two minutes, the object merged into the cloud above it and became obscured.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At its highest observed altitude (as it moved into the cloud), the object could be distinguished as a spherical shape, a black dot at this point.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I observed the object , I was so captivated by what I was seeing that I failed to do a simple time count as it ascended; but the total time from near ground level to the cloud base at 25,000 ft. was not more than 3 minutes maximum, but could have been as little as 30 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Following the event, I placed phone calls to the nearby Forest Park administrative office as well as a local university&#39;s science departments and inquired if any kind of balloon had been launched. All inquiries came of negative.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I inquired into how to find the accurate cloud ceiling for the date and time of the sighting and was referred to the National Weather Service where I found the Three Day Weather records and June 4, 2013, data established the cloud ceiling at OVC250, which means overcast at 25,000 Feet, and that matched what I observed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Using a speed and time calculator, I found the following possible indicated speeds of the object.  The following speeds are based on three estimated times for the object to travel from near ground level to 25,000 feet. 30 seconds, 1, 2, and 3 minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 3 Minutes: 94.69 MPH<n> <n><n> 2 Minutes: 142.04 MPH<n> <n><n> 1 Minute: 284.09 MPH<n> <n><n> 30 Seconds: 568.18 MPH<n> <n><n> <n><n> Having seen a variety of balloons in the air, I’ve never seen a balloon ascend at these rates of speed, and although I cannot state exactly “what” this object was, it must have possessed considerable size because I was able to observe the object at the cloud ceiling, or 25,000 feet.<n> <n><n> <n><n> If anyone else in the St. Louis area observed this object on June 4, 2013, I would very much like to see additional details.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  The source of the report is well known to NUFORC, and we consider him to be both exceptionally capable, and exceptionally reliable.

It will hover, slowly move up, down, side to side, or move at an extremely fast rate, but always returning to the same area it started from.<n> <n><n> <n><n> One night a plane passed close to the light and it moved quite a bit higher up and then returned to its spot when the plane had passed. I have witnessed 1 or sometimes 2 of these types of lights in the sky every night for nearly a month now.  On one night only, I also witnessed this same light but as it would move across the sky it had a firetail.  When not in motion it was just the odd colors of lights. In the beginning of May I witnessed a strange orange light trail shoot across the sky and suddenly just disappear.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have looked online for some sort of explanation such as satellite lights, ect. and have come up with nothing to explain this. I have showed this light to several people and we all are left stumped and shocked as th! ey witness it too.<n>

The signal covered up the very bright sun so I could see very clearly.  Then I noticed this white circle of light moving slowly from right to left.  I had a couple cups of coffee and a good nights sleep so I was very alert.  When I had stopped at the traffic light I was very grateful the signal covered up the blinding sun.  Then I noticed the sphere.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was 6 45 am early in the morning and the sun was brilliant.  When I first saw the orb  it was to the right of the sun in 3 o&#39;clock position. moving down and towards the left.  It was very high and left no trail…I notice aircraft and this was no jet, balloon, blimp,or anything man made that could move so fast and high up in the time it took to move.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was not afraid and followed it closely with my eyes…there was no time to reach for a cell phone camera.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I also was not sure if the sphere was projecting its own light or if it was reflecting the sun.  It did not sparkle or twinkle.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then the orb moved quickly up above and to the right of the sun again, moved slowly to the left and then zoomed up and very fast into space. It was a total viewing time of about 10 seconds.  It was a marvel to see.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I got to work I told some coworkers what I had seen and went to check the weather.   The humidity was 67% and wind was 2 MPH from the south west.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was a very exciting start to my day and I texted my family about it immediately.<n>

The light was about 20 times brighter than the brightest star and singularly bright white with no other colors visible. It never twinkled or varied in brightness as it traveled very slowly across my sky view.  I stopped walking to verify that it was indeed moving and not my imagination. I noticed that it had a very unusual trajectory.  It seemed to meander a little east and west never moving in a straight line.  From the south I observed a blinking red lighted aircraft that I now think was a terrestrial air craft approaching the bright star.  I started realizing something was odd when the blinking red light came in very close airspace to the star and appeared to tag along with it.  The blinking red light had a very straight trajectory and did not move like the white light did.  As I was watching this unfold the lights moved beyond my field of view blocked by my gara! ge.  As I started to back up very slowly, I started to also move to my left which exposed a huge portion of open sky that was previously blocked by my garage.  I then realized there were at least 3 other moving stars moving against a constellation of dimmer stars giving me the illusion that I was seeing 8 or more other moving stars.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I ran back into the house to get another person to witness this, but when I returned with the witness a few moments later all that was visible was the original moving star with the blinking red light beside it still traveling north.  The 3 or so moving objects were gone and just 4 or 5 dim stationary stars in a constellation remained.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

We were walking across a small meadow to our camping area when we paused to look up at the stars as it was a clear night and had been cloudy and rainy of late.  We were discussing the relative visibility and general appearance of satellites versus planes – similarities and differences, when my friend pointed and said something to the effect of, “now WHAT is that?”  We all then watched a very bright light moving at a relatively slow speed, a speed which would not have seemed unreasonable for conventional aircraft.  And we were in fact near a small airport. Ithaca Tompkins Regional Airport was due northwest of our location about two miles.  However, several things about this light did not reconcile with what any of us could consider conventional.  As I said, we were near an airport and every night would see planes coming and going – most often travelling from east to west or west to east relative to our position. In fact there was at least one visible in another part of the sky at the time which gave us something to compare the object to. The strange light appeared above the trees due south of our position and it travelled in an arc that was mostly north and a little bit east when it eventually fell out of view against the treeline.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The first odd thing about it was the light. Rather than any blinking light or combination of red, green, yellowish, etc. it was bright white light. I would say it was about as bright as Jupiter when Jupiter is super bright. Maybe a little more intense than that. In other words, the object was brighter than any star in the sky but not enormous and blinding. It did not blink or quaver, but rather was continuously bright as it travelled. There were no other color lights as there often are on aircraft. Just one bright light, far brighter than any other aircraft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Sound: the brightness of the light would have only seemed reasonable if the object were fairly close to us yet we heard no sound at all.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Flight path: as I said, the path was roughly south to north from an area that would have taken it over Fall Creek, Lower Creek Rd, and then northward disappearing from our vantage point as it headed toward Etna Rd. The speed, as I said, was not unusual, but the deviations from a straight line were peculiar. It followed the general path I just described but at times would “squiggle” for lack of a better word, in a way that would be wildly impossible for any conventional aircraft. I don’t know how to estimate the scale of these sudden, rapid movements. They were not large or all over the sky, but rather just as if the object were like a needle on a record or seismograph and it was bumped…it would squiggle off the path and then back on again. Another way to describe it would be to say that the object was capable of “jumping” from side to side and back again…not like floating and moving but just an occasional and erratic jump through space from one location to another (whether t! he space was covered represented 30 feet or 30 yards, I don’t know as I don’t know how far away the object was or how big) instantaneously. Each time it happened, one of the three of us would say to the others, “did you all just see that? Are we really seeing this?” So we were confirmed in knowing that we were not “imagining” what clearly was out of the ordinary. One of the witnesses was a Veteran who has spent time around all manner of aircraft, and he was quite sure he knew of nothing which could perform the “stunts” that we were seeing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The path of travel that we could observe (which was limited due to the treeline surrounding the small meadow) probably took about 3 to 5 minutes. As it disappeared behind the trees we all debriefed and were pretty agreed that we had no logical explanation (despite the nearby small airport) for what we had seen. A few nights later (maybe 3 or 5 nights later?) two of the three of us were again in a slightly different spot at the campground, and we saw the same phenomena again. However the available viewable sky from our vantage point was very small so we could only track it for about 30 seconds, though it was very similar and travelling a similar north/northeastern trajectory.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Regarding animals: I am not suggesting a correlation, but for what its worth I heard coyotes howling and &amp;quot;carrying on&amp;quot; that night (it was the first and only time in my four weeks that heard them) probably 20 minutes or so after the sighting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I would note that two of the three of us were camped in that location for four weeks, as we were part of a wilderness skills program. So we were quite familiar and acclimated to the local sights and sounds, including the typical airport traffic and patterns.<n>

I spotted an orange object moving approximately south very rapidly; it passed just a short distance over Jupiter.  I would compare its apparent speed to that of a low flying jet fighter except it was completely silent.  The object was bigger than a point of light and was not symmetrical; it seemed to have a longer dimension perpendicular to the direction of flight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object continued south and seemed to curve toward the southeast as it gradually faded from view as it approached the horizon.  I would estimate total time it was in view at around 15 seconds.  My best guess  is that it could have been a meteor passing through the atmosphere more or less parallel to the Earth&#39;s surface although it did not leave a vapor trail.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What makes me doubt that the object is a fireball is that about 2 or 3 minutes after, I saw a satellite on the same path moving south to north and passing right above Jupiter. Then a couple minutes later, I saw another satellite again on the same path going from north to south and also passing right above Jupiter. That seems like too much coincidence for me to come to terms with.<n>

During filming, both objects disappeared from sight at 2 different times and locations.  I scanned the sky but could not find the 2 objects.  That was when I saw a 3rd object coming from the same direction with the same course and speed.  I started a 2nd video to film the 3rd object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The 3rd object descended at a constant rate and could not be seen after it descended past the horizon.  It landed somewhere in the western part of the city or outside of the city.  It was hard to tell.  From my viewpoint, the 3rd object landed south of the Black Hill, where the old Saint George Municipal Airport existed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

Moving unnaturally, undirectionally through the sky at a controlled speed<n> <n><n> <n><n> Two of us were sitting on a trampoline in my backyard when my dog ran to the east corner of the yard and barked once, which caught our attention.  When she ran back to us, we noticed a bright object to the east in the sky.  It looked like a planet, but brighter, and vertically shaped.  It was moving at a constant, controlled speed, faster than a plane yet incredibly slower than a shooting star or a meteor.  There were no flashing lights and no tail, only one solid white light.  It was moving from south to north, first at a downward curve, before it moved closer to us which we were able to notice by its increasing size, and then once more at a downward curve moving north before it disappeared behind trees.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It traveled west to east and passed nearly directly overhead.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It traveled the full arc of the sky over us.  It was in the sky for at least 3-5 minutes and was bright enough to be seen even through some light scattered clouds.  It was visible much longer than usual for aircraft we see, and I’ve seen a Galaxy land.  This light was brighter. This did not seem like an airplane at all.<n>

At first, the object hovered over the Federal building, which is a quarter of a mile south of the UCLA campus on Wilshire Blvd.  Our building is approx. 1 ¼ miles southeast of the Federal Building.  The object glowed with a bright white light, which was significantly larger than any star or planet in the night sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object dropped quickly like a falling star out of sight.  Fifteen seconds later, it rose again.  The light changed to blue, then green, then red as it moved east much more quickly than a helicopter.  It zigzagged and changed direction and altitude very quickly.  At times, several colored lights appeared at once.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The round object was higher than the 12 story buildings over which it flew.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Finally, after three or four minutes, it dropped out of sight, near the UCLA campus.<n>

It was flying lower than a helicopter and a lot slower. There was no sound and no outline or silhouette of an aircaft.  It traveled over my head and out my view.  Three times this month I have observed this same light, or ones exactly alike. Each time I observed these lights it is always the same, and coming and going in the same direction.  One witness observed three lights together on a seperate night, flying in a triangular formation. I have never seen this before, anywhere, in my whole life.<n>

They came a few minuits apart and followed the same basic path.  The first one, which I have included a still image of. was lower than the other two. The clouds were quite low that night and it was below them.  Id say under 200 feet.  The objects moved steadly and made no sound. I have also included video of one of the other objects, this one was higher up than the first one.  This video needs freeze frame zoom analysis.  It is hard to film these objects because of their glow, the camera cannot focus on them.  But the still image I have is quite clear.

The speed appeared to be consistent, at first, with an aircraft.  However, there were no red or green wing tip lights and no strobe.  I estimated the altitude to be approximately 4,000 feet.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I kept my eyes peeled on the objects hoping to get a more detailed look as they got closer, but before the first object was closer than +/- 2 miles, it began to ascend at approximately a 35° angle to the horizon.  The orange color faded and the size of the object diminished until it took on a star-like appearance and within a few seconds disappeared.  The three objects following took the exact same path.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Moments later there were three more orange lights which took the exact same path.  Following that, a few moments later, there were three more.

(Although there have never been any rocket launches over Ohio that I know of.)

We stopped our car to look at it and we saw that the 4 shapes were moving in the same direction.  Then two of those shapes stopped for couple seconds and changed velocity in the opposite direction.  The two that were moving in the opposite direction blinked for a second and then disappeared into the sky.  The other two shapes kept moving from north to south for about a minute and disappeared one by one.  Each shaped blinked at least once before it disappeared.  This may be due to the clouds.  I was looking at those shapes at a 45 degree elevation.  In my background there were street lights and cars passing by.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My mother was at a neighbor&#39;s house at the same time and she described similar characteristics but the objects seemed bigger and more light was observed at the bottom of the shapes.  She explained that she saw the four objects moving from south to north then it seemed to come down a little and then went back up.  They finally started going in the direction of north to south.  She said she saw the objects couple minutes before we started noticing them.<n>

This night it was particularly bright and even blinding.  So I could not directly look at it to take the shot.   With my phone cam I stuck my arm up out of my car window and snapped a shot.  I was surprised to see that a single rose colored oval object was in the photo and rays beamed from the sun.  So I took a second picture and this time there showed a con trail and the object was gone.  Weather conditions were overcast.  A slight rain before.  If it is an optical illusion I am sorry for wasting your time.  I just wanted a professional to observe it.  Thank you in advance for your time and trouble.  Please do not release photos without my permission.  Thank you.<n>

Suddenly everything went kind of silent and I had what I can only describe as a primal fear response.  Something just told me to get inside.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As i walked up my five steps to the  backdoor, I noticed lights in my right peripheral vision.  I thought it might have been a  cargo plane, but as I turned to focus on the  lights I immediately realized it was not any  kind of conventional aircraft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was illuminated by a bill board  allowing me to see the entire craft.  It was  illuminated by a billboard on the side of hwy 98  so i assume it was over santa rosa sound (i  live right by santa rosa sound on the other side  of hwy 98).<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was huge, dwarfing the billboard  sign.  It had a white light on each corner of the  craft and an orangish reddish orb on the bottom  center.  I saw a row of smaller white lights  going down the side.  The body of the thing was matte black colored or very dull charcoal  grey.It was exltremely slow moving, maybe 2mph  from my point of view.  It looked like it just  floated kind of.Its direction was west to east.<n> <n><n> <n><n> All of this lasted for about only 8 seconds, i was still standing on the top step of my  stairs.  At this point i was in complete shock and  felt as though all the blood had just left my  body.  My memory gets kind of blurry here because  of the adrenaline going on, but i openend the  door and yelled for my mom (im 22).  By the time i  looked back and my mom got outside  it was  absolutely gone.  And i mean this thing was HUGE  and just gliding completely silently pretty close to my house only seconds ago and then it was gone?! 	 We stayed out there looking for about one minute and then eight trucks of some kind  came flying down the highway,all with their red emergency lights flashing on top. They were  traveling together like a convoy in the same direction and location where i last saw this  triangle craft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It is important to note that i live  right by the southern boundary of Eglin Airforce  Base.  Also, the night before this me and my  mother witnessed a strange light at a much greater distance.  The bottom line is this thing  was huge, silent, moved impossibly slow, and was  something that  is absolutely unknown to me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am a college educated young man and i do not do any drugs.I&#39;m an avid fisherman and  living right by Eglin i&#39;ve seen everykind of aircraft they&#39;ve got, but this was simply life-  changing.  I would like to know if anybody else  reported this on June 1st because it was so  close and enormous and slow i know other people  had to see it.  If it weren&#39;t for my mother witnessing the convoy vehicles with flashing lights pursuing this, i would probably question my sanity.  It was simply surreal and amazing and i will NEVER forget this until the day that i die.<n> <n><n> <n><n> PS I made a sketch that could be provided.<n>

Was that there were 20 to 30 lights flying at low altitude, perhaps 1000 to 2000 feet above the ground.  The lights seemed to be attached to some kind of craft because they were all moving together in Unisom But we could not see a craft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were driving northbound on I-5 as we approached the lights moving very slowly across the freeway.  They took up a large area across the freeway but as I mentioned we could not see a craft.  My one son thought they may be helicopters flying together but they were moving silently and at a very slow speed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I caught up to lights and passed underneath them I immediately looked in my rearview mirror  to see where they were going. I saw nothing ,either whatever it was left without me seeing it or the craft or lights could only be seen from one side.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Again I could not see a craft nor could my sons just the lights. I asked my 13 twin boys if they too were seeing the lights to make sure I wasn’t imagining things they confirmed seeing the same thing I was seeing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I work as a photojournalist for a local TV station. I called the station to see if anyone else had reported seeing the lights. The person working the assignment desk told  me they had gotten reports about  orange/red lights in the sky the night before, Friday May 31, 2013… In my career I have seen and flown in many Military aircraft and have also flown in helicopters covering news events. But this was really different there were no white or red blinking lights usually seen on airplanes and I would expect an aircraft flying that low would be very loud and we did not hear a sound.<n>

There wasn’t a single cloud in the sky.  I noticed something about half way through the cigarette, a little tiny light in the sky appeared from the right side of the Eastern night time sky..<n> <n><n> <n><n> My first impression was “It’s probably a plane”  But I noticed the tiny orb that looked EXACTLY like a star,(And had no flashing lights of any kind)  It was moving across the sky a little faster than an airplane usually fly’s.  The altitude of the orb seemed way too high for a plane to physically reach. There was absolutely no sound around whatsoever.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The orb traveled towards the left side of the Eastern skies, moving in a strange pattern, I guess the most accurate word for it would be “Semi-Zig Zag patterns”  After watching it for a good 2 minutes, It slowly disappeared as it made a turn going even HIGHER into the nighttime sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> (At this point I knew for sure what I saw was NO airplane, &amp; certainly NOT a comet)  The object was also both accelerating and slowing down a few times, but not drastically.  It shined a bright light that made it look like a “perfect star” about half way through the sky.  Then slowly began to fade towards the end of the second minute.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I checked several times after, &amp; stared at the sky where it disappeared, hoping to see it again, but it never came back.<n>

It was hovering and moving slowly in a SE direction.  It seemed to be smooth on the underside and licking flames towards the sky, like a fire.  When I noticed it, it was large and appeared to be relatively close to my house (within a mile).  After about thirty seconds, it appeared to be moving away more quickly and either fading or getting further away rapidly.  It soon disappeared behind the trees and out of my view traveling in an SE direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

As we sat outside I noticed an orange orb rise into the east sky.  I called attention to it and others saw it as well.  It flew near an aircraft and did a circle around it.  Then proceeded at high speed to the west.  It never blinked or made any noise what so ever.  It was very bright and reminded me of the tip of a lit cigarette against the night sky, a perfect circle glowing bright orange.  It flew west behind some tree cover and as it almost left our field of vision, it instantly turned bright red and then faded away like some one turned the light off.  Due to its incredible speed and that my friends saw it as well, i believe it to be a ufo.  I&#39;ve never seen anything like this before in my life<n>

It was bright with blue hue in it and with a long tail (blue white) and was brighter than the sunset.  We surmised that it must have been a comet, but later looked for any evident of any comet reports within the area and there was none.  We watched it for another 5-8 minutes as it disappeared to the north.  We didn’t think to video it until the last 15 seconds which only shows a small white light disappearing off to the north.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We watched all news cast, online reports, and any pre-comet/asteroid events to no avail.<n>

Then clouds obscured it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About 20 minutes later one other witness and I again saw two small white, spheres about one half mile east of us over Denver quickly going from north to south.  They were in unison, one slightly above and behind the other as they passed from view.  Their altitude was only a few hundred feet.<n>

The object was moving at a steady pace south to north.  It was round, and about the size of Venus, a little larger, and noticeably brighter.  It did not blink, flash, make noise, or change color.  About 20 degrees east another light, possibly a meteor, flashed across the low horizon.  At that moment the light stopped, paused for about a second, and started moving east. The angle of path change was about 90 degrees, possibly minutely obtuse.  The speed was slower after this.  At this point I ran to get my brother to have another witness, but the object was gone by our return.  We waited for 10 minutes, but the object did not come back into view.  It is the third object I have observed in that area, but I did not report the other two.  This object bears a resemblance to the first I saw in that area, about two years ago.  That object moved in similar way, but slower.  It also changed color from white, to red, to g! reen, back to white, to blue, and back to red.  That object moved in a sporadic zigzag for about 15 minutes before shooting up at great speed.  Both these objects and another were seen within a half mile of each other, and all three times what appear to be meteors have fallen during or just before the sighting.<n>

As it got closer it slowed down tremendously and glided across the sky.  It look like it had 2 wings, pointing north and south, with fumes coming from the bottom of both.  The bright light was in the middle.  As it went past my car at about 1000-2000 feet above the ground, it disappeared behind me. I lost it, I couldn&#39;t locate it anywhere.<n>

There are virtually no streetlights and houses are far apart; hence, our view of the night sky is excellent.  I often step outside in the evenings to gaze briefly at the sky--ever hopeful I may be rewarded with the sight of a meteor.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Early Friday morning (06/01/2013) between 1 and 2:00 am, I briefly stepped outside onto our front deck but, after checking the sky for a couple of minutes and seeing nothing of interest, I was just about to go back inside when a pair of bright stars (at least that&#39;s what I thought they were at first) in the eastern sky just above the treeline caught my attention.  The reason they did was because they actually appeared to be moving AWAY from each other in completely different trajectories!  As I watched, the brighter star (which was, from my perspective straight above the other, slightly dimmer, star) began to descend vertically towards the tree line.  At the same time, the dimmer star started moving horizontally in a northerly direction.  After going a little way on these separate courses, both hesitated, stopped and began moving back toward each other again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They moved back and forth like that slowly for a few minutes while I stood there, trying to figure out just WHAT they were and HOW they were doing what they were doing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I then dashed inside our trailer--looked briefly for my pair of binoculars (but couldn&#39;t immediately find them)--and grabbed my Canon XS-100IS camera before dashing back outside.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was able to take a little video and a couple of still shots while I fiddled with the settings trying to get something documented on film; however, I don&#39;t own a tripod and the &#34;stars&#34; were so far away that the quality of whatever shots I was able to get was severely downgraded.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I went back in the house briefly, found my binoculars and dug my small flashlight out of my purse.  I decided to walk down the driveway to my daughter&#39;s place, bring her back with me to my house so someone else might be able to confirm what I was seeing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My daughter got out of bed and followed me to our house at the top of the hill and confirmed that she also could see these two &#34;stars&#34; moving back and forth.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Looking through my binoculars, I scanned a group of very small, very dim &#34;stars&#34; directly to the north of the first two and noticed, after &#34;pulling out&#34; the zoom function of the binoculars that these lights were arranged in a very organized-looking pattern -- resembling 2 triangles stacked one atop the other with their apexes faced in opposite directions (like a &#34;Star of David&#34;).  My daughter also took a look at them with the binoculars and confirmed they appeared to have this pattern.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I returned to observing the first 2, brighter, stars and noticed the brighter one was changing colors from blue to white to amber (or red/yellow) in rapid succession.  After about 15 minutes or so, when I glanced back at the group of dimmer stars which had been arranged in the &#34;Star of David&#34; shape when last I looked at them, I found them to have moved into a different pattern which resembled a wheel with a &#34;hub&#34; in the center.  There were 2 &#34;rings&#34; of lights at that time -- one &#34;inside&#34; the other -- and what appeared to be one light in the exact center of these 2 &#34;rings.&#34;<n> <n><n> <n><n> All together I (and later, my daughter) observed these &#34;lights&#34; exhibit inexplicable motions and patterns for nearly an entire hour.  They were still exhibiting these characteristics when both my daughter and I went inside for the night and went to bed.<n>
