Traveling from Atlanta to T|8/7/07|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/057/S57253.html|1|ndxe197104| I did not record the date, I could not tell you if it was April or May, but I know that the year was 1971.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Traveling from Atlanta to Thomasville Georgia, I reached Hwy. 319 going into Thomasville around 7pm and I was only a few minutes from my destination with about an hour of daylight left.  It was when I approached dirt road where I was to turn, that I noticed about 5 or 6 cars were pulled over to the side and there was a large beam of light coming from the sky.  I made an attempt to identify where the light was coming from, but after a quick observation, I decided I really didn’t care because I was anxious to get to my family.  I turned right onto the dirt road, which happened to be where all the cars were pulled over viewing the light.  I proceeded down the road and I noticed within moments that the light was above me.  I looked up through my windshield and this object was following me and was just above the tall pines.  I began driving very fast and it kept pace with my ’69 Camaro. I finally made it to the construction site and pulled into the driveway with object stopping at the entrance.  I quickly left my car and ran into the house.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There were about 11others there; being Friday all the contractors were still hanging around, especially since they were all cousins and uncles.   I told everyone with much excitement they needed to see what followed me home!  My dad looked out the window and immediately shouted, “Stay in the house.”  We all stood still and watched as the object floated towards us and then lift up just as it reached the house, at which time my dad shouted, &#34;“Get out of the house.&#34;<n> <n><n> <n><n> All eleven of us ran out the door at almost the same instant.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was a saucer shaped object, silver with red and blue glowing lights that seem to illuminate from the portals on the top.  It was approximately 50’ to 60’ in diameter.  The exterior had a smooth finish; there were no signs of any joints in the metal, just a few indentions where maybe a door and the lights were.   It was hovering about 20’ above us and bouncing from where our cars were parked to the house.  At one time we were all afraid that it would land on top of the house, it came so close, but it would go up again and bounce over to the fields.  We all watched this object quietly and no one moved.  For an instance I wandered who was watching whom.  The object no longer was showing the bright light that it had when it first began to follow me.  At one time I thought of going to my car and getting my camera, but I did not want miss anything.  It wasn’t long after this thought that the object began to travel farther in the field away from us.  It began to go up higher, still not making a sound, and in a blink of an eye it traveled so fast that in just a second it was a tiny silver dot in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We all remained silent for a few moments; still in disbelief of what we had experience.  The next day there were reports in the local newspaper about several unidentified flying objects around the Thomasville, GA area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

I had a strong feeling not to discuss this sight with anyone, as interesting and astounding to me as it was.<n> <n><n> <n><n> While riding home from middle school in the backseat of a Volkswagon Beetle I was gazing out the rear window of the car when I saw a silvery perfectly round object that resembled a full moon rising steadily against a gray overcast sky.  There was no rain occuring, just a dry overcast gray day.  At that time, I was thirteen years old.  I knew that what I saw was not a weather balloon, due to the fact that my father, a small aircraft pilot, had taken me numerous times to the local airport to view weather balloon launches, and I was very familiar with all that weather balloons involve, both visually and mechanically. While watching this object for about thirty seconds, I felt that I was not intended to see it, and I made what I felt was a conscious decision to never discuss what I had seen.  I noticed the object ascending from the East, and I watched it with apprehension until the vehicle in which I was riding turned a corner and went down a hill towards my home, and my view was blocked by landscape and trees..  When I first noticed the silver circle it was about 20 degrees about the visible horizon, when I lost sight of it thirty seconds later it was in what I would consider the 11:00 AM position, but not overhead, still east of me. To the east of my sighting location there was no developments, airports, cities, etc.-- just rural area. The object seemed to be very close in proximity and relatively the size of a full moon, and metallic-- silver in color.  Twenty-seven years later, I can still visualize and feel exactly what I witnessed in 1971, and I still have an eerie feeling when I think about it, whic is mostly all the time.<n>
4/15/71 03:15|Rural New Mexico (no city)|NM|Triangle|35 minutes|I saw three triangular craft in the middle of New mexico at around 03:15.|6/4/14|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/109/S109352.html|3|ndxe197104| I saw three triangular craft in the middle of New mexico at around 03:15.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was traveling to New Orleans on Interstate 10 and was approximately 110 miles east of the last town and alone on the road.  I saw lights far away behind me which slowly gained on my while I traveled along at about 80 mph.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Over the next 20-25 min these lights slowly grew larger and more clear till they finally resolved into three seperate yellow lights of very high intensity.  I&#39;d been driving for about 5 hours by this time so I pulled off onto the shoulder for a rest.  As I said, I&#39;d been going about 80 mph and the lights had steadily gained on me but when I pulled over, they slowed down appreciably.  As I sat on the hood with a bottle of water, I was amazed to see the three lights separate into three triangular-shaped craft which cruised along in echelon at about 50&#39; in height with about 10&#39; of seperation both side-to-side and front-to-back.  At the nose, they were about 6&#39; thick, top-to-bottom, and about 4&#39; wide at the apex of the triangle.  Going back from the nose, they were flat on the bottom but angled up at about 15 degrees and along the sides, widened at about 25 degrees.  Overall they were about 40&#39; long and at the rear, they were about 12&#39; in eight and 15&#39; to 18&#39; wide.  They shone a yellow light at the nose with a red light at each rear corner.  I could seen no openings of any type though the nose did show the outline of something in the space where we&#39;d place a windshield.  They were all an identical flat gray/black color without even much or any contrast except where a shadow might mask an area.  Unlike most of the reports I&#39;ve read or heard, I could discern nothing in the way of sound, electrical effects, or anything else out of the ordinary.  After it became clear as to what they were, it took them about 15 or 18 minutes to pass fully by and pass from sight.  About 4 minutes after passing me they angled Northeast away from the Interstate towards some mountains off in the distance I&#39;d estimate some 40 to 50 miles away.  I watched till they blended into the night and then continued on my way.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date may be approximate.  PD))<n>

4/11/71 23:00|Carrolton|GA|Circle|30 minutes|Lights in the night sky of carrolton|2/12/04|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/034/S34969.html|5|ndxe197104| Lights in the night sky of carrolton<n> <n><n> <n><n> This happened to me a long time ago so the date and time are as close as I can narrow it down to.  In 1970 right after I had graduated from high school I went to Carrolton Georgia to attend West Georgia Colledge.  I believe the name has changed to The University of West Georgia.  I entered at the end of 1970 and left in 1973.  The best I can remember was this event happened in 1971.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At the time the student center had a small valley that seperated it from the gymnasium.  At the bottom of the small valley beside the student center was a small pond.  Almost every night that was nice there were always people sitting around the pond and the general area.  This night was a moonless night and the sky was very dark as it was somewhere around 9 to 11 PM.  Me and a friend were walking from my dorm room to go to the gym to lift weights and had just walked past the front of the student center when we noticed people looking up into the night sky. We were looking over the pond about half way up into the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As we looked up we saw 4 or 5 round objects each one had a different solid color.  I can&#39;t remember all the colors but one was solid blue and one was red.  They were close to each other and in a perfect horizontal line.  Although they appeared to be far away they were still about as big as the end of an eraser on a pencil.  All of a sudden they would jump out of line and do these eratic maneuvers and then get back in line.  The angles in which they moved were nothing a aircraft could do and they were doing these maneuvers as fast as the eyes could keep up with them.  We watched for what I estimate was about 30 minutes and left.  When we left the lights were still there and many people were still watching them. I would estimate 30 or more people were there.  The solid colors never changed and there were no blinking lights.  They didn&#39;t appear blurry at all but just circles with a particular solid color.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have no ideal what they were but I expected to hear something about it but the only thing I ever heard was another student there say it was swamp gas.  Well I just never bought that as this was a rural area and the night sky was as clear as you could ever expect.  Not one cloud was in the sky.  My dad had retired from the Navy and was in what they called MATS, which stood for Military Air Transports.  I grew up on Navel air stations in Norfolk Virginia Port Lyauty Morroco and Rota Spain and went to sleep with planes taking off all night long. I knew what planes in the sky looked like and had seen all kinds of conditions observing the sky.  In the 60&#39;s we had no TV over seas so we spent a lot of time outside at night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I can only imagine that at the time most colledge kids were considered dope smoking hippies and the relationship with this rural town was strained.  Maybe no one felt like reporting this to the police as they would not be taken serious, who knows?<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

4/5/71 19:00|Talladega|AL|Disk|5 minutes|irridescent disc spinning silently below treetop level at approx. 100yds distance.  nothing between us and the object to hamper vision.|4/26/99|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/006/S06104.html|7|ndxe197104| irridescent disc spinning silently below treetop level at approx. 100yds distance.  nothing between us and the object to hamper vision. newspaper reported as weather balloon (out of Ft. McClellan) NO WAY!!!!<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am not sure of exact year about 1971 or 72 maybe even 73. This event happened in the spring of the year when my family was cleaning off the garden spot.It was our tradition to have a weiner roast and burn just prior to planting.  We had already finished the roast and our large bonfire had burned down pretty low . My sister had gone inside, mom was getting the stuff to take in. Dad and I were raking more onto the fire to finish burning.  There is a cow pasture on the northern side of the garden spot with a sloping hillside. At the eastern end of the pasture is a small stand of trees (mostly longleaf pines).Almost simultaneously mom, dad, and I saw the craft right at the edge of these trees and below treetop level. Dad&#39;s comment &#34;what&#39;n th hell?&#34; was instantly followed by &#34; ya&#39;ll get to the house&#34;. I responded &#34;no, I want to see it &#34;  but don&#39;t think I could have moved if I tried.  Mom just kept saying &#34;oh Lord, what is it?&#34;  The disc spun  silently for several minutes. There appeared to be a strip of light in the center of the disc  all the way around. As it was spinning it seemed to constantly change colors like those of a prism .  It seemed as though the craft was reflecting the lights from within.The craft itself was a silvery color. Our coonhounds were in the pen right beside us but paid no attention . I do remember that the rooster crowed but whether or not it was his normal evening crow is debatable because it was right at dark.  After a few minutes the craft took off going straight up. It was completely out of sight in a matter of 2 - 3 seconds.  Although the craft itself made no sound there was a sound like when you inhale deeply just as it started up ( like moving air) but we felt no wind.  I said earlier that I don&#39;t think I could have moved and I substantiate this by the fact that as soon as the craft took off my mom  started toward the house saying she was going to call the police. Until it was gone none of us had moved even one step, just stood there dumbfounded.  Daddy stopped mama telling! her she would not call the police or anybody else. He told us not to tell anybody about it. Said he didn&#39;t want people thinking we were crazy. The next day there was an article in the local paper &#34;The Daily Home&#34; in which officials from Ft. McClellan Army Base about 40 miles away claimed this was a weather balloon. There had been numerous reports of a strange light made the evening before.  Apparently all the reports were made by persons who saw the craft airborn and from a distance because what we saw from less than 100 yards, stationary and as big as a small house would have taken a far stretch of the imigination to conclude to be a weather balloon. I made no mention of the event for several years.  While engaged to my husband I told him about it and was promply laughed at. For several years his skepticism continued.  Then on January 31, 1996 he too witnessed some unusual craft from a lookout point at Oak Level in Cleberne Co. AL  We reported the incident to the UFO hotline that morning but I have been unable to find documentation of the report on this website.  This being the case I will file a report on it as well.<n>
4/5/71 18:00|Orlando|FL|Disk|2 Minutes|Orlando, Pine Hills Disk|10/31/08|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/065/S65799.html|8|ndxe197104| Orlando, Pine Hills Disk<n> <n><n> <n><n> As a child in the early 70&#39;s (date in report is approximate), I was playing kickball with my friends in the street in the Pine Hills area near what is now Meadowbrook Middle School.  All of a sudden, the girls started screaming and pointing at the sky.  Looking up, I observed a disk shaped UFO with two rows of blinking light panels located on the bottom and around the perimeter of the disk.  I distinctly remember that as an inner panel glowed an outer panel was illuminated and vice versa.  The panels turned on and off in a checkerboard pattern continuously and almost appeared flourescent.  I say &#34;almost&#34; because no &#34;bulb&#34; was observed, either directly or as if hidden behind an opaque or transparent cover--the entire panel glowed evenly with no observable concentration of light.  The craft traveled from south to north no more than 50-60 feet above our heads.  It moved very slowly, in complete silence, and then disappeared behind dense trees (what is now the area immediately south of North Lane in Pine Hills).  The Orlando International Airport was a SAC strategic bomber base at the time and, as an adult, I now believe that the craft was somehow connected with the base.  I have no evidence to back that supposition.  I find it interesting to note that a 1966 report and a 1976 report on this site also note glowing light panels.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.

4/3/71 20:00|Santa Rosa|CA|Light|30 Minutes|Unbelievably beautiful spatial anomaly|3/11/03|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/027/S27141.html|9|ndxe197104| Unbelievably beautiful spatial anomaly<n> <n><n> <n><n> My father and I were driving over a ridge top just at dusk when we saw the phenomenon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object was at the far right of our view and was moving majestically from right to left horizontally at about half the speed of a satellite - VERY slowly. The object itself was about three times the size and brightness of Venus on a clear night. There were maybe 13 ‘rays’ coming from the object that spanned approximately 25 degrees of arc (it was huge, anyway I couldn’t cover it with both hands at arms length) and were equal in brightness to the object, uniform in thickness and length, and absolutely ‘steady’. In other words, they did not ‘waver, change color, or vary in any way until the object ‘exploded’. It was as if someone were slowly moving a static transparency across the night sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Well, we were amazed! I quickly found a turn-out, stopped the car, and my father and I got out and sat on the hood of the car to watch it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As objective as I’ve tried to be it’s impossible for me to judge the time we sat there watching this. I have to say maybe 20, even 30 minutes, although it felt much longer.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After it had crossed 2/3 of the sky, it ‘exploded’. I say exploded, but I really don’t know what it did, it was so beautiful and inexplicable. Suddenly the ‘rays’ disappeared like a light switch being turned off at the same moment a ‘ring’ of fuzzy light expanded rapidly from the object (which at that moment retained it’s size and brilliance) and, in about 2 seconds time, vanished out of sight over the horizons and into space. This ‘ring’ lost about half of its intensity during this expansion.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then, VERY slowly, like the unfolding of a six petaled flower, the object itself began to expand: As it expanded, in perfect symmetry, it rotated very slowly. This phase of the experience lasted maybe 5-10 minutes. It continued to rotate and expand in graceful majesty, slowly growing dimmer and dimmer.<n> <n><n> <n><n> By this point the ‘lines’ of the ‘flower’ were becoming fuzzier and less distinct. Until it filled the entire sky from horizon to horizon, although by this time it was extremely dim, like a fog or vapor, with the ‘lines’ only barely visible.<n> <n><n> <n><n> And then it was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What was it? I don’t know. It felt somehow ‘alive’ to me… like the creature in the first Star Trek: Next Generation pilot movie. It didn’t seem like a ‘craft’ exploding because of the perfect symmetry. The speed with which it was moving gives me the feeling it was quite distant, above orbital range, perhaps as far as lunar orbit, but I am no physicist.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The local newspaper reported on it the next day, and I suppose many people saw it, although I’ve never spoken to anyone who did. They said it was a Soviet rocket stage re-entering the atmosphere. Maybe it was, but I don’t believe it. I’ve seen these re-entries, and they resemble large meteorites, flaming and breaking apart and moving quite a bit more swiftly across the sky. I just don’t know.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

I was down-hill when I noticiced this metallic blue-silver, brighter than neon light with no windows.  The light didn&#39;t light up the surrounding area but was extremely brilliant.  I was chanting at the time I saw it and I wasn&#39;t afraid.  I am grateful for the opportunity to be able to tell about it as my husband wouldn&#39;t believe me when I told him.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
