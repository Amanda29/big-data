That&#39;s when I saw my first ufo or rather I should say it saw me and I&#39;d like to add that I&#39;m not prone to hallucinations nor strong drink. I think my sighting is very unique in that I was pulled over by a ufo. Let me elaborate. I left my house to go to my dads one evening about dark. I didn&#39;t have far to go as he only lived about 5 miles from me. As I was about halfway there, I saw revolving blue lights in my rearview mirrow. As I was in the city limits of town, I thought naturally that it was the local police pulling me over for a traffic violation, so I pulled  over and stopped. I looked rearward and was shocked to find no one there. No police car, nothing. I then looked to my immediate right and saw an immense object just sitting there over a citrus grove. I had the distinct impression that it was observing me and I felt like they wanted me to see it. To say that I was apprehensive is a bit of an understatment. Yet, I was fascinated. It was an absolutely beautiful craft. It was huge. (I estimated it to about 50 to 75 yards in diameter.) It was well enveloped in light which didn&#39;t seem to radiate outward much if at all.  It appeared to be made of a metal similiar to aluminum.(bright and shiny) There was absolutely no sound whatever. Having read of numerous abductions as I&#39;ve always had an interest in the ufo enigma, I felt that my best recourse would be to leave. (I was scared stiff) After I left, I looked back and it was gone. I don&#39;t know why, but for a long time after that, I couldn&#39;t seem to tell anyone about it. Like it wasn&#39;t important or something. I didn&#39;t have any missing time so I&#39;m quite sure that I wasn&#39;t abducted. Another strange thing about this is that the ufo or whatever it was didn&#39;t arrive and leave in the conventional matter. It just appeared and then dissapeared. Poof, gone. It was the most vivid scene I&#39;ve ever saw.I shall never forget it and sometimes I wish I could see it again.<n>

It was a few weeks after Christmas (1968). I and my future wife (name deleted) were staying with friends for a few days. Around 10 or 11 PM we both laid down to sleep for the night. Let me describe the house a bit this well mean something later. Our friends had put us up on their living room floor with the usual blanket and pillows. The living room was adorned with a large fireplace (no fire, just for decoration I guess) which was at our head and our feet were placed at the opposite end, which to the right was the front door and to the left an open hallway to the kitchen. There was a dim light left on in the kitchen and the living room was dark except for the faint light from the kitchen.  The front door was made of solid wood and had a couple of small windows in the very top, there was also a glass screen type door on the outside with glass top and bottom, both doors were locked for the night. The rest of the room contained the usual items, carpeted floors, coffee and end tables, chairs, lamps, cabinet type stereo etc. The outside of the house was adorned with large trees (maple I believe but not sure of this) and were much taller than the house and shaded it very well. And now on with the story: We hadn&#39;t lain down to long I guess and then it came!  Right through the front door to the right of our feet. A ball of light about the size of a soccer ball or a 10-inch paper plate passed right through the glass door and through the wooden door. It immediately went to the ceiling over our heads paused then broke into 5 equal size pieces, danced back and forth and mixed them selves as they danced and hovered over our heads.  Never getting close, as they stayed tight against the ceiling. I remember saying to ((name deleted)), &#34;What is that?&#34; and here reply, &#34;I don&#39;t know.&#34;  After a few seconds or minutes later one of the shapes broke from the others and started along the ceiling towards our feet and then started down the wall like it was searching for something back and forth, up and down. Let me describe the shape because this is the very interesting part. Like I said it was about 10 inches in diameter and glowed with a bright white light. There was no definite shape to the object other than the approximate size and it was circular. There was no body to the object and yet you could not see through it. All 5 of the objects were equal the best I could tell and were of the same light intensity. The strange part as the object entered the room and broke into 5 there was no light emitting from them (the room stayed dimly lit from the light in the kitchen) yet they were bright white and emitted no light. As the one object broke from the group and was on its search (or whatever it was doing) it cast no shadow on anything or lit anything brighter than itself. The light was so bright from the object that you could not see its true shape other than it was circular and spherical. Being 18, full of vinegar and not really thinking about what I was doing. I got up from where we were laying and started toward the light that was dancing on the wall. ((female&#39;s name deleted)) stayed were she was for the time being and watched. I followed the light and was within about 2 ft of it at all times and tried to visually see what it was by stretching my head within touching distance (maybe as close as 1ft.). I peered into it and was straining my eyes to see if I could tell what it was then it started down the wall and was going to go behind the stereo. My first thought was that it was going after the electrical outlet. That&#39;s when I got brave and reached out to touch it before it was gone. As soon as got with a few inches of the object it shot with amazing speed upward to the ceiling  (I jumped back out of reaction) and watched it shoot through the front door the other 4 followed one by one as if in a procession line. ((femeale&#39;s name deleted)) popped up and we both went to the front door to see where they were going. I twisted the knob the door was lock with a dead bolt. I fumbled around and got the door open and then found the glass screen door lock also. Soon we were outside and seen the lights dancing above the roof of the house (approx. 14 foot off the ground) among an opening in the trees.  They soon grouped together as one again and shot straight up, zigzagged a bit and left at an amazing speed.  I remember saying something to ((female&#39;s name deleted)) like I have no idea what it was and her reply, &#34;me neither.&#34;   We went back inside and secured the house and lay back down. For the next 2 hours or so we heard a jet circle the area. You could here it coming closer and listen to it as it faded off in the distance and then hear it reappeared from another location.  It was definitely circling the area for some reason. I figured radar must have picked up the objects we had seen or something perhaps larger where they had went.  Perhaps the plane was just a coincidence and not related at all, this part doesn&#39;t really matter. It was just an observance the same night and we fell asleep listening to it fade away and return. The next morning when we woke, ((name deleted)) didn&#39;t mention anything about the night before and I got to thinking it could have been a dream and would keep it to myself till she spoke first. I anxiously got the morning paper hoping there would be something in the news about the aircraft that was circling the area or a clue to what had happened the night before. Nothing in there but the usual garbage, so I dismissed the whole thing as a dream since ((name deleted)) did not mention anything about it for the next few days. Well life went on and ((name deleted)) and I were married and eventually moved to Hanover Indiana. Several years later we were on our way home late one evening (after dark about 9pm or so) with the two girls. And we all saw a shooting star (meteorite) as it streaked across the sky. The first words out of ((name deleted)) mouth was, &#34;Remember that time down in Florida we saw the lights in the house?&#34;  I almost run off the road!  My God it wasn&#39;t a dream after all!  It really did happen!  After we got home and got the kids to bed I pumped ((name deleted)) to see what all she remembered and it was exactly as I did right down to the finest detail. It is really strange that we did not discuss this encounter till 8 years later and it took a meteorite streaking across the sky to open her up. I ask her why see never talked about it before and she said she really didn&#39;t know. ((name deleted)) and I were divorced a few months later. I saw her about a year ago and it was brought up in our chatting about our past encounter.  She told me she felt it happened for a purpose and really didn&#39;t understand what or why it happened but it defiantly did happen. I have been in search from time to time since to find someone with a similar experience and have posted articles on several UFO message areas and was once the MUFO  (Organization for Mutual UFO&#39;s) Fidonet coordinator for Indiana, KY and Ohio.  I have yet to find anything really close to this encounter other than Foo lights and there&#39;s not to much talk about them anywhere and really just barely related.  I have no idea what it was but it seemed peaceful, seemed to mean us no harm, did not want touched for some reason and was able to pass through solid objects (wooden door and glass). From this day in 1968 and to the present day I 2000 do believe in UFO&#39;s and close encounters and contest that all the is written here is pure fact and not fiction in anyway.  It&#39;s really hard to discount something you see with your own eye close-up and have a witness to back it up. ((contributer&#39;s name deleted))<n>

1/8/69 21:30|Pittsburgh|PA|Other|5 minutes|Flat black color, 6-legged, toy jack shaped, basketball-sized object on the ground melting snow in a squall|11/11/13|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/104/S104287.html|6|ndxe196901| Flat black color, 6-legged, toy jack shaped, basketball-sized object on the ground melting snow in a squall<n> <n><n> <n><n> This report is about a snowy winter night in 1968, 1969 or 1970.  That is the best I can pinpoint the ‘ancient history’ from my past.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The unidentified object was shaped very similarly to a jack in the child’s game of ‘ball &amp; jacks’. It was on the ground, tilted so its low side faced the city.  It was flat-black color. Its circumference was slightly larger than a basketball.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Toy jacks that I recall had 4 legs radiating outward from a center axis.  This object had 6 legs.  Two front legs were feet-on-the-ground, facing the city.  Two legs were a bit off the ground and to the left and right sides of the ‘face’.  Two ‘rear legs’ in the back of the ‘jack’ were off the ground facing uphill.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was an odd configuration because whoever saw it asked, at least instinctively, “How could 4 legs off of the ground be outweighed by the 2 front legs that were on the ground and tilted to face the city?”  This basketball-sized jack with the flat-black finish was sitting halfway up a hill in Grandview City Park in the Pittsburgh, PA.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A neighborhood named “Mount Washington” overlooks Pittsburgh. Mt. Washington has two well known vantage points that gaze across the river at the downtown skyscrapers.  These vantages are Grandview Avenue and Grandview Park.  They are on opposite ends of the neighborhood. Grandview Avenue got lots of pedestrian and vehicle traffic.  Grandview Park got much less, especially during winter.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The park has an observation deck near the main entrance.  Uphill from the deck, the park is ‘terraced’ by 3 service roads. Atop the hill are 2 huge water tanks.  The park’s lowest road is its main service road (no public access for vehicles].  It’s between the hill and the observation deck.  This road is 2 vehicles wide.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There are 2 more single-lane service roads.  They are further up the hillside. The position of these roads gives a framework for the remainder of this report.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The highest service road goes to the water tanks.  At its apex it was about 60 yards (175’) higher than the main service road.  The middle service road was about 40 yards (125’) above the main service road.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I know these distances because on snowy nights I practiced playing football.  Specifically, while walking our family’s fearless German Shepherd, I played quarterback.  I threw snowballs at trees. They were adjacent to the service roads and spaced apart at intervals of 10 to 50 yards.  I knew the distances with respect to the same distances on a football field.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Facing the water tanks and, thus, facing away from the city, the large hill is gumdrop-shaped.  At its base is the main service road.  The highest and midway, single-lane service roads curve across the face of the hill.  They intersect at the main road.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This particular night I walked Duke (the dog) up to the top of the hill.  It was snowing medium hard.  We could see only the brightest lights of the nearest downtown buildings.  And those lights were fuzzy &amp; foggy.  The same was true for visibility of the park’s service road street lights at the opposite end of the park’s main entrance.  Only the 2 of us were walking through the park.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The snow was ankle deep to mid-calf, depending on drifts formed by the wind.  The snow was deep enough that the wind that whistled through the park during winter had not yet blown any spots bald to render them devoid of snow.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We walked along the highest service road over the crown of the hill facing the city, walked down the hill to the midway service road, to double back to where we entered.  Duke was usually rambunctious and very curious.  He knew my game of snowball football. Sometimes, he liked to race me to where my snowball hit a tree.  That night we’d done some casual racing in the snow to about 10 trees.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We got to one of his favorite places to race &amp; run.  The next tree was about 40 yards away. He liked hearing “pop” when my snowball hit that tree.  He liked to take-off as he watched its flight.  But he didn’t on that night.  He shied away from hurrying toward that tree. He avoided the upside of the service road and stayed his leash’s length away on the downhill side toward the city. He usually preferred the uphill side because other dogs marked their spots on the uphill side.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As we made our way toward the tree I’d just hit with a snowball, I noticed a depression in the snow on that service road.  I couldn’t yet see it clearly because the city lights and park street lights were dimmed by medium-heavy snowfall, but there was definitely something dimensionally odd about a point in the snow near tree I’d just hit.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The nearer we got to my new ‘line-of-scrimmage’ (the tree), the more Duke was reluctant to continue. He always led the charge toward any new curiosity.  But he didn’t this time.  As I got nearer, I saw a circular black spot with almost no snow on the asphalt service road. Then I started seeing the jack-shaped, object dormantly sitting there.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I got about 2-3 yards away from it.  Duke stayed with me although he had enough leash to go sniff it -- which he’d done with everything before and after our encounter with that object; put his nose right on or in it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I did not feel heat radiating from the jack, but heat had to explain why there was no snow in the radius around it.  I ventured to a bit more than an arm’s length away.  I picked up a pinch of the fluffy snow and sprinkled it toward the jack.  A bit of my sprinkling landed on it and was gone in less than 2 minutes.  It took only slightly longer to vanish than the regular snow falling on and around it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Meanwhile, I studied it as closely as I dared.  I saw no seams, nothing that resembled a hatch or window.  Yet I had the distinct sense that it was specifically facing the city lights; almost like admiring the view through the snow while enjoying the calm &amp; silence of such a snowfall.  At the same time I had a definite sense of “Hands OFF!  Don’t touch!”   The center of the jack had the biggest pod/cylinder; both in diameter and height.  At the end of each leg were smaller-scale versions of the same pod.  The pods were approximately the same diameter as the legs that connected them to the center core.  If they were different diameters, then it was by a mere millimeter or less; measurable only with calipers.  Small as it was it didn’t seem spindly.  It seemed sturdy.  It didn’t seem hostile, but it wasn’t inviting or overtly friendly.  It emitted a sense (or invisible aura) of power . . . not energy, but of power.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Duke inched nearer to it only as I did. I was his shield and security.  This was totally out of character for our fierce, fearless dog.  I’d always needed to restrain him. He was a trained attack dog that K-9 police gave us because he was too aggressive ~ until he encountered this jack.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This whole encounter was 3-5 minutes. I stepped past the jack, threw a few more snowballs at my next possible (football receiver) trees, drifted back to the jack for one last look, and saw no changes.  Then we returned home.  My snowballs were unusually accurate that night; missing 1 or 2 of 75-80 throws.  The next day my brother took Duke for his morning walk.  I told him about the black jack.  He looked for it.  It was gone. But where I’d seen it there was a divot in the snow shaped like the bottom of a basketball.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thinking about it you’ve got to ask: “Why was all of the ground below it devoid of snow?  Why not only where just the front feet touched the ground?  How did the black jack get there?  Obviously, it didn’t walk or tumble there.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Why were there no tracks or footprints in the virgin snow?”  That made no sense. It had been snowing for 2-3 hours.  Anyone/thing moving afoot through the park would have left telltale tracks.<n> <n><n> <n><n> And, Duke very cautiously and tentatively stuck his nose only so close as if a spherical energy field was radiating outward from the jack, just 1-2 inches beyond the full length of the jack’s legs.  My observation was that Duke knew or sensed something to the effect, “That’s as near as you get!”  But maybe it was selective/smart shielding because snow was OK for touching the jack.<n> <n><n> <n><n> These are my thoughts articulated today (November 2013) but at least subconsciously in my 15-17 year-old awareness during the encounter.  It was weird, semi-spooky, and it simply “didn’t add up”.  While looking at it I pondered picking it up and taking it home to show Dad (a master engineer of power plants, steel mills and water processing facilities).  But Duke avoided the jack as though it was the Plague -- a sign to duly consider.  And I had no idea of where to put it, what to do with it, and it ‘felt’ too strange.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The jack looked different than all other UFO configurations/shapes that I’d seen before and that I’ve seen since.  I kind of have regrets about this probably dubious ‘opportunity’.  But I played it safe and I’m still alive to tell you about it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ----------- Completing the end of this report form . . .<n> <n><n> <n><n> Contact me if you want.  I can not accept (pay for) a collect call.  I don&#39;t prepay my phone with so much money.  Also, I did not see the object land.  It was already on the ground when I saw it.

My friend and I were driving north on Sunday night. I was the passenger and dozed off for the duration of a Sinatra song from an radio station in Miami, when I opened my eyes and saw appearing off to left of the road, up ahead if us, cloud-like material, as if being poured into a round pan, like a making a pancake, then a second right behind it, and then a third, at which time I asked my frined what the__is that? Although we were told not to stop anywhere in the Everglades, unless absolute;y necessary, I said &#34;pull over! Let&#39;s go take a look! We got out of the car. and I cannot remember walking forward, but when we got up ahead of the car about 20 yards, the objects were NOT in front to the left of us, but up higher and absolutely  due West! They were 3 round clouds stationary, and I remember when I looked directly at them, they exploded like a flashbulb into 3 orangish-red ovals and started to move. No sound, no trail. I can still see myself looking up at the bottoms of the objects, and then, at the fastest  (warp?) speed I&#39;ve ever seen shot straight up....leaving 3  spidery-like whitish lines in their wake.<n>

My father worked at the Nev. test site for many years and witnessed several unexplainable sightings. I&#39;ve seen a few fireballs, etc. myself over the test site and surrounding areas. I&#39;d just like to add some legitimacy to the many stories by reporting one of many sighting as told to me by my father in 1969. Standing on a plateau about 20 miles from area 51 he witnessed a craft &#34;just by chance&#34; emerge from what must have been an underground tunnel at a very high rate of speed, instantly making a 90 degree turn and shooting off over the horizon. The craft made no sound, nor was there a sonic boom. &#34;this was 1969, I wonder what they have today&#34; ? The entire event took less than 5 seconds. My father believed they were testing anti-gravity propelled jets. My response to the man from Las Vegas is, he should get out and watch during the day more. This is when he&#39;ll see more activity . You just have to keep looking up.

However, a few months back on a whim I looked up the word on the internet. It turned up in one language only, called Manx, meaning &#34;Highness.&#34;  I had no idea what Manx was or where it was spoken. I did some research and found out it is an extinct Gaelic language once spoken on the Isle of Mann off the coast of England.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In one of Whitley Strieber&#39;s books, Transformation, that there was a possible connection mentioned between the Gaelic languages and the Visitors.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I suspect that maybe I was &#34;visited&#34; at a very young age in Greensburg.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was one other incident, maybe around 1970 or 1971, where I thought I saw a purplish silhouette of a man (or something) standing outside my second story window. He (or it) would have been standing on our sun parlor roof. Anyway, it scared the shit out of me. But I have always passed that off as a hallucination, or maybe even an after image from rubbing my eyes. It also could have been my older sister playing a prank on me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>
