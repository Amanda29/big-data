2/29/04 23:20|Seattle|WA|Unknown|55Min+|Three rapidly sparkling objects hovering over Seattle to the WSW, two left after short time, one remained.  ((NUFORC:  Star??))|3/2/04|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/035/S35340.html|1|ndxe200402| Three rapidly sparkling objects hovering over Seattle to the West, Southwest, two left after short time, one remained.<n> <n><n> <n><n> While taking a walk on Capitol Hill overlooking Downtown Seattle toward the waterfront on a cloudy night, we noticed a rapidly sparkling object in the sky about 23:20 hours. At first we thought it was a helicopter hovering but it was really high in the sky, too high for most helicopters and it had no FAA strobe pattern.  It was sparkling at a rapid pace changing colors all the while and it would momentarily &#34;dim out&#34; during this sparkling action.  It would change colors from a bright white to yellow, blue, bright red, and green could be seen just before it dimmed.  The colors listed are not necessarily in order of display as it sparkled but all would be regularly present.  We watched it for almost an hour hoping it would move or do something but all it did was hover in the same spot.  No starfield was visible this night and it was too close and bright to be a star but higher than most helicopters would be seen at.  No way to tell how close it was but used a streetlight pole to determine that it wasn&#39;t moving from the position it was in the sky.  The moon would move position slightly in the sky during the hour that we watched the object but the object did not move.  Finally, we were cold from standing still so long and since it was not moving or doing anything decided to go back in and stopped observing the object at aprox 00:10 hours.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I must say that we saw two other objects that matched description of the main object but the two other ones were further away and disappeared from view.  Not sure if they flew away in the opposite direction to us or if they literally disappeared.  The were in a row stretching out to the west.  The one in the middle appeared to be more faint than the one on the far (west most) end.  All sparkled the same so as to appear to be the same type.  Could not tell precisely what the shape of the objects were but if we had to guess we would say it was disc shaped.  As far as duration of sighting on these other two objects, the faint one in the middle was observed only briefly and we got the sense it was further away the west most was observed for at least ten minutes.  The main one that remained was in the sky southwest toward West Seattle and more west than southwest.  If straight up was 12 O&#39;Clock in the sky and one assigned the value of 6 O&#39;Clock to the horizon then the persistant object is estimated to have been at about the 4:45 level.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We suspect a star may have been the cause of the sighting.

I noticed what I thougt was one of the planets that has been in the sky lately. I was looking at it for roughly 5 minites tring to figure out which plant it was, it than moved very fast to the south and faded out of view. I tried to reason what it could have been and given the facts, that it was as bright as one of the planets that I&#39;ve been watching, staying in the same place for at least 5 minites, then taking off at a very high rate of speed there&#39;s no queston in my mind that it was a UFO. It was a extremly clear night here on the west coast in northern Californa.I could not make out a shape because of how high it was in the sky. I could only see the very bright white light.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Number of witnesses: 2 Number of objects: 1 Shape of objects: Round  Full Description of event/sighting: a very large, bright white object in the northwestern sky, stayed in one place for about ten minutes, then appeared to fade in brightness slowly, then it gradually moved north over the period of about 15 minutes. it then slowly disappeared from view, it was far to bright to be a star, and did not move in the fashion of any satellite that I have ever seen. I&#39;m sure that other people must have seen it, as it was to bright and long to miss    Additional Information Below:  I will answer your questions in order.<n> <n><n> <n><n> (1) The movement appeared to stay in one place for about ten minutes, then very slowly moved north until moving out leaving my view. It was a very clear night except for a low cloud line, about the altitude of the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> (2) the altitude , if it was in the atmosphere, was about the same as the Grouse mountain range if being viewed from Vancouver.<n> <n><n> <n><n> (3) The color was bright white, just like a very bright star, although it was about twice to three times the size of Venus to the naked . Very big and very bright. The brightness faded slightly as if it were moving away when it appeared to be stationary.<n> <n><n> <n><n> (4) I did see one plane fly right in line with the object, although the plane appeared to be very far away, probably a commercial line,( the blinking red light) was faint.<n> <n><n> <n><n> (5) No trail of any kind  (6) the second witness only viewed the object for about 5 min. but I can assure you that her interpretation would be similar as we discussed the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am very interested an fairly well informed on these matters as I have been the witness to several sightings and in occurrences throughout my life, please let me know if you find anything out. I&#39;m sure that YVR must have noticed this object.

And I jumped up and looked at the window and saw a bright light. All of a sudden I froze, I felt relaxed and comfortable the light must have hypnotized me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Description:  It was oval and had a square in the middle of it and it was very very bright it had two lines in the middle and a thick antenna on top.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Mom: At approximately 9 P.M. this evening I was seated at my computer desk when startled by a bright light zooming past my window. I immediately got up to see what was going on when the light flashed and was gone immediately, no sound no noise nothing just gone!  I remember thinking it may have been the police because the lights went past so fast, it did not seem plausible at all, but for some odd reason I did not give it any further consideration at that time until my husband was alerted by our 11 year old and our five year old that there was something strange in our back yard.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We are very &#34;down to earth&#34; type people and deal with what is &#34;realistic&#34; pinch me if you would because I had always associated &#34;realistic&#34; with what is known and now I have to change this theory to realistic - once seen!<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with the father and older daughter, and we found them to be seemingly quite sincere and credible.  The daughter described how she and her younger sister were seated in their bedroom, when the entire room suddenly was illuminated by two bright flashes.  Their impression was that the flashes had emanated from outside their window, so they quickly rushed to the window, threw the heavy curtains aside, and were witness to an oval shaped object, intensely bright, hovering less than 30 feet from their window.  The object then accelerated away from them, disappearing from their view in seconds.  The mother, who was in another part of the house, was witness to the two flashes, and she saw the oval object depart, also.  An excellent report, in the opinion of NUFORC!  PD))<n>

We arived shortly after 5 pm and I was in the house with my Inlaws. My son came in and asked me what that is in the sky. I looked up and was astoniced to see 6 lights to the east of kingsport. I hollered to my Brother and sister inlaw  to come out. The biggest and brightest was like pollised gold was at the 5 o&#39;clock of the moon with the mid sized one which was green to the left of it and the red grape sized one to yhe left of it. They made a triangle with pee sized blue lights to the right and bottom and left of them. We watched for several minutes as the blue lights moved. The bottom one came up to the right of the left blue light and the right blue light cme over to the gold light which was the size of a grapefruit. Then the blue light from the right begin to move around the gold light and then to the top of it. I asked if they had a vidio camera and they didnt. I realized that I had An digital camera in the car and went to get it. I took several pictures and decided to call wjhl tv to ask if they had any reports. I was given to the weather  room and told the Man what I was looking atand he said he would go and see if he could see them. He hung up and we kept watching.Then my son aked me what the white Cigar shape was . I was stunned to see another object comeing from the east to the north west. Over the trees and begin to take more pictures.As I was looking at this object My sister inlaw told me to look up. When I did ,It was another cigar shape moveing from the east to the south west. I tied to get a picture of it too,but it was moveing to fast. As was the first. The sky was remarkably clear with nothing but blue sky.When I looked for the others they were gone or I just couldnt find them again.Something That was strange and made me report this to the Police and airport the next day was around the same time this was happening, or before it, A plane crashed at tri cities airport. The air port was in the direction of these objec! ts. I Al so never heard a sound from any of them. And there were to jets at the same time very high leaving con trails.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I live on a hill so i was able to see the object and viewed it through binoculars and then with a video camera. The object was lensatic in shape but too far away to make out any details except for shape and color. The object had an aspect ratio of  about 6-1 and was highly reflective on one surface and flat black on the other, or so it appeared. I watched and filmed the object for about 5 minutes as it ascended at a 45 degree angle until it was out of sight.Video has been submitted to MUFON for analysis.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We express our gratitude to Mr. Kim Shaffer, MUFON Assistant State Director for Tennessee, for this report with NUFORC.

Several people in the Vankleek Hill region (west of Hawkwsbury Ontario) saw green and red lights hovering in the sky for several hours. A high speed plane came around and left, but the lights just seemed to stay there for a long time, sort of flashing. The witnesses are to shy to call you about this but I know that they are very credible people from the region. They actually called one another and witnessed the same thing simultaneously . Could this have been something like a weather balloon ?  Someone said it could have been a space station, but I said why would it have lights on it ? One of the witnesses is my father (name deleted) I tried to explain that you guys can help explain the mystery and it is often very simple but they are afraid to look crazy I guess !  thank you !

At first my friend and I thought it was a commercial jet, but as it got closer to us we noticed it have 3 bright lights. We then realized it was not a commercial jet because by the speed and altitude it traveled at, it was impossible that a plane of that size could be flying that low. At a point it almost appeared as if it was going to land on the freeway. As we began to pass it on the freeway it hovered above us, and we were able to see a clear view of the object. It had three bright lights and had a triangular shape with a non reflective black surface. We then tried to follow it by getting off the freeway and chasing it down the surface streets, but as we got closer it just dissapeared in the night. I should add that there was also a helicopter very close to the object traveling in its same direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The bright light could been seen in the western sky of Medina County, Ohio.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I actually saw the object as I left work from Lorain County, Ohio around 7:30PM &amp; it seemed to have followed me on the Ohio turnpike, than onto my home to Brunswick Hills, Ohio which is in Medina County, in which I stopped first. Than it really scared me when it lined up with the road as I went to my husband&#39;s business to pick him up for late night dinner around 8:45PM. I showed him &amp; his mother, they both agreed it was wierd, my husband got out his digital camera &amp; could see movement of this object, it was not until I got out my Cannon XL Digital Camera that you could see that it was unusual. It disappeared around 9:45PM.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It looked like a white circle with a red line around it &amp; than inside of it looked like heated energy moving fast, than it changed to embryo like appearence, in which it looked like a bean with the top part caved downward. It than exploded in a backward motion &amp; than it was in a circle shape with three points on the left side, &amp; than it turned into a six pointed object, almost looking like a saw blade!

2/28/04 18:40|New Orleans|LA|Light|15 seconds|Star-like object meandering in sky|3/2/04|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/035/S35329.html|15|ndxe200402| Star-like object meandering in sky<n> <n><n> <n><n> 6:40pm Central time. While outside talking on the cell phone with my mother, I looked up at the moon, which was directly overhead, and saw a star-like object in the southern sky move westward toward the moon. It looked just like an average star, except it was moving. The object did not blink, was white in color and appeared to be very high in the atmosphere. It did not leave a trail and was moving approximately the same speed as a satellite. The object passed under the moon and was obscured by clouds moving in from the south. The sky was mostly cloudy at the time with a few breaks in between to where the moon and stars were clearly visible.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I saw the object, I pointed in the direction I was looking (south) and said to my boyfriend and mother (on the phone), &#34;Look at that star moving up there, by the moon!&#34; I viewed the object for 3 or 4 seconds before I lost sight of it behind the clouds. I looked at the time on the cell phone and noticed it to be 6:40pm. My boyfriend did not see the object, but continued to look at the sky. My mother, who lives on the North shore of the Lake Pontchartrain (I live on the South shore), did not see the object as she was inside at the time. I then told my mother I would call her back and continued watching for the object, but did not spot it again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We decided to stay outside a little longer and I continued to watch the sky, which was still mostly cloudy with fewer breaks in between the visible areas.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 7:40pm - Spotted what appeared to be the same object again in the Southeastern part of the sky, which was clear at the time. I pointed it out to my boyfriend and said, &#34;There it is again!&#34; We both watched the object move erratically northward, then ENE until it passed out of our view of the horizon. Looked at the clock on the cell phone and it was exactly one hour later than the first sighting. Duration of second sighting was 10 to 12 seconds. When I spotted the object the second time (my boyfriend did not see this part), it moved quickly in a very erratic motion then moved northward at a steady rate, where my boyfriend was also able to pick it up. The general movement of the star-like object reminded me of an insect in flight (specifically a dragonfly), where the dragonfly would hover over a potential landing site, i.e.: stick or twig, examine the site a bit but not landing (or as if it was performing evasive maneuvers from another insect) and then flying off to find a better spot, not in a straight line but meandering.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I then called my mother again and told her what I saw. I said the object was heading in her general direction and she should go outside and see if she could spot it. I told her it was pretty cloudy on the South shore of the lake, but the North shore seemed to be in a clearing, as she did not see any clouds, nor did she see the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Another factor that my be relevant, but was not noticed at 6:40pm, possibly due to the cloud cover, is there was a strange halo around the moon (one quarter full) that I had never seen before.  The halo was approximately 6 1/2 to 7 feet in diameter from my perspective with the moon being 1/2 inch in diameter. I have see halos around the moon many times before, but they were always close to the moon, never this far away! My father said the halo was probably due to ice crystals in the atmosphere reflecting the light of the moon. The color of the halo was the same color as the moon and a perfect circle. I watched as clouds covered the area of the sky that the moon was located and the halo was also covered. I could only see it when there was a break in the clouds. The object, when spotted the second time, was within this halo on the Eastern side (moon was now in SW sky). I watched the object pass out of the halo and continue on as described above.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We went inside at this point since there were just too many clouds. I went back outside at 8:40pm and the halo was still around the moon, but I could only get glimpses of it through the clouds. The sky was almost completely covered in clouds at this point. I did not spot the object again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I then went back inside and received a call from my mother. She stated that she could also see the halo around the moon, but it appeared to be purplish in color to her. She also saw 2 beams of iridescent light shining down in her general direction on the North shore of the lake, between 8:00pm and 8:40pm, she&#39;s not sure of the time as she was going in and out of the house. She described the lights as being an upside-down v, with the moon being the starting point. The lights appeared to be &#34;bubbling inside&#34; with iridescence, as stated by my mother. She thought the lights might be a trick of the eye or a reflection off of her glasses. She could not tell if the beams of light were touching the ground from her vantage point. My mother said she began to feel uneasy at this point and went back inside. I went back outside to see if I could see this as well, but the moon was not visible.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My mother calls back at 8:50pm and says, &#34;I&#39;m not going out there anymore! I saw the beams of light again.&#34; She went on to describe the lights as stated above, but felt like one of the beams was shining directly at her. She got scared and went back inside. I haven&#39;t heard from her this morning, but I assume since she didn&#39;t call me back, she didn&#39;t observe anything else unusual.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Its was transparent looking but showed a reflective white pattern.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As the package fell, it looked like it was tethered on a loosely packed string of pearls.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Instead of being straight bellow the balloon, it snaked back and forth in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The length must have been incredible.

I was about to turn around and go to my bed when I saw a blurbed little red light pop on near Jupiter.  It was originally heading south, but it turned west from its course by large swoop-like turns, like a ball on a string.  After the first light had caught my attention, three more came out of the east, at a steady speed in a loose echeleon formation.  Two were flying straight and rigid, while the one farthest south was swerving around like a bouncy ball.  While they were as close to being directly above me as they ever came to be, an incredibly bright meteor, short, extremely fast.  It did NOT effect the craft in formation.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About fifteen minutes afterwards, I saw a another strange looking meteor, the reason I say it looked strange is because it looked extremely low, like a trace bullet.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The red lights had no particular shape, just little red blurbs of light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am known to be a mostly honest person.  With only one witness, that being me, this probably doesn&#39;t count all that much.  But I knew what I saw and it scared me plenty.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I also saw the first one throght binoculars, so I knew I wasn&#39;t seeing things, and I wasn&#39;t dreaming either.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The Big Dipper was in the eastern sky.  My husband was looking up and told me to look at the Big Dipper, that he could see something.  I observed four lights in a straight horizontal line, lights that looked like stars, because they seemed so high up in the sky.  The lites were moving towards the south, then they turned widely in an arc, then were heading west.  The lights were softly lit or &#34;dim&#34;, not  bright and stayed in a straight line the whole time I saw them.  They flew over our house heading west.  I couldn&#39;t see anything besides the lights, although the area around the lights seemed to be darker than the rest of the sky.  I&#39;ve seen planes in the night skies and I know what they look like...this wasn&#39;t anything I had seen before.  And the pattern, or rather lack of pattern of the flight seemed erractic, not in a regular &#34;airplane-way&#34;.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Please see husband&#39;s report.  PD))<n>

I was staring at the Big Dipper because it looked so close, when I noticed four very muted lights fly through the dipper part.  It flew south till it got midway through the  tail and turned west kind of erractic, like it over compensated, then corrected itself.  The time was probably 10 to 15 seconds we could see the lights before it flew over our house where we lost sight of it.  We&#39;ve seen lots of planes when we&#39;ve been outside looking at the sky at night and this was not the normal actions or flight path of any plane we&#39;ve ever seen. The sky was very bright and there wasn&#39;t any clouds in the sky. The lights were the size of stars, so I assumed this was very high up in the sky.  If you weren&#39;t looking at some star constellation very closely, you wouldn&#39;t see this.  It was almost stealthy-looking. We never saw any shape around the lights. The lights were moving too fast to be a normal plane. We&#39;ve seen military planes very high up in the sky with their vapor trails, and satelites fly over,but this wasn&#39;t any thing like that.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke at length with this witness via telephone, and he sounded quite credible and sincere to us.

I watched a few minutes of the tape and being an airplane mechanic by trade it did not have a classic light pattern of any commercial aircraft.It appears on tape to be 3 objects close together. Two close together off the sides moving irregularly,and one in center more classic,disc shaped,spinning as my wife said &#34;Like a top&#34;.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Intrigued I went upstairs to try to see what I just saw on tape for myself and again I caught on video this time what appeared, a very far distance off at this time, maybe 8-10 miles, an unusually bright object over eastern PA.It was most certainly not in the airplane flight path as planes taking off from Allentown appeared to be moving from the NW to the SE towards me at a steady speed. This object moved from the east due west.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;ve never really believed but it was unidentifiable to me.It was strange.Bright at times moving rapidly in the distance then gone.All total maybe 20 minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I thought how strange it was to see such a clear sky with only one very bright star which appeared to be hovering over the top of the tree line.  As I continued to look up at this star, it suddenly started moving slowly right to left while making a humming sound.  It stayed above the tree line for approximately 15 minutes.  I called my husband at work and he informed me to get the camera.  I took 3 pictures of the object.  I am hoping the photos got a clear shot of what I witnessed.  After the pictures were taken, the object lowered itself behind the tree line.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain anonymous, and provides no contact information.  PD))<n>

It was like a medium size star, but it just kept moving and I had to get up and go to other side of house to follow it. Was it a satellite? There was no sound, and it seemed to be very high up in the atmosphere. Although it seemed to slow down a times, I can&#39;t really really say for sure. The path seemed to be fairly straight.

After a few hours of wandering around, we saw a red flash of light to the west of us. Of course, we started to walk over there. I looked at my watch and it read 3:11. Then there was another red flash of light, and my watch then read 3:31. We were a little freaked out, so we went back to the tent, where we saw that one of my friends had several red dots on his back that looked almost like mosquitoe bites. We then discovered that we all had several of these &#34;dots&#34;. That night I had a strange dream about being brought on a saucer shaped ship. The next morning, all my frinds had had the same exact dream.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness asserts that he has photos of the wounds, but we have not received copies, yet.

Each light appeared to be able to move in any direction both forward back and up and down which caused us to realise that we may be seeing something unusual.

I was driving home from getting Gas and observed the two objects glowing red, green, and white they were hovering and very slowly heading in a westward direction. At first I thought they might be helicopters or small planes. I lost sight of them for a couple of seconds behind some trees and when I was able to see again only one of them was there. I pulled off onto a side road and turned the vehicle off and rolled down my window. at this time and for the duration of the sighting no sound was apparent. I watched for about a minute. I looked around to see if there were any more and did not see any. When I looked back the second object had reappeared. I observed both objects hovering for about five more minutes. Suddenly the first object dissapeared followed a couple of seconds later by the second. I waited for about five more minutes and they did not reappear. They seemed to be hovering like fireflys as best as I can describe it. They would go slowly up and down and side to side in no set pattern. I did not observe any sudden movements or anything else.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I live in NW Pennsylvania in a very rural area about a mile south of lake erie. I did a little research and found similar objects being seen in this area before. I am about 30 miles east of the Perry Nuclear power plant and objects of this or similar nature have been observed there since the 80&#39;s.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On a side note, about a week ago I saw what appeared to me to be one of those small airplanes they were using in Iraq. The un piloted white ones. I only caught a glimpse of it but what I did notice was that it was white with no visable markings. It was also flying very low in an area about a half mile from the 2 objects I saw today.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I went outside and looked up to see an object rather high up, and floating along at a liesurely pace. The object would waiver back and forth showing that it was a flat disc.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I watched it for about 10 minutes before it floated quite high and became very hard to see. I wouldnt be reporting this except for the fact that this object seemed to be rather large, and it was a disc shape... i&#39;ve never heard of a weather balloon in this shape before. There were no lights at all on the object, no sound, and it had a shiny metallic skin. I *think* there was a design on the flat face of the object, but I couldn&#39;t make it out.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I really do not know what to make of this... I think it was probably just a balloon since it never acted like it was &#34;under control&#34;, but its definately the strangest thing I have seen in the sky to date.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I had decided to go outside and get some air, even though it was fairly colod out. I did, and I looked at Venus for a while. Suddenyl something appeared to the left of it. It was a very thin, disk-shaped object, with blue/green lights lining the whole side I could see. It stayed in the sky for a while, the began moving to my right. It didn&#39;t move very fast, but it began to go left and right, then stopped, and just kind of disappeared. I stood there in shock for a moment, then thought about what I had seen. This is not the first time I have seen a UFO in the area where I live.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

If it was man made, it would have been located up in orbit, or at least above FL70. The object could not have been reflecting the sunlight because the luminosity was constant even though it moved. Most things only reflect at certain angles.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I looked into the Northern sky and saw a very bright star. I asked my friend what it was and he was stunned. after 10 seconds of no movement it stopped glowing and looked silver and shiny. Ilooked at my friend and asked if he could really see it. I looked back and it was gone. We seached the sky for 10 min or so and couldnt find it again.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It moved at different speeds could stop on a Dime.|4/9/04|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/035/S35972.html|42|ndxe200402| Object was CigarShaped, very bright leaving short ,thin exhaust vapors. It moved at different speeds could stop on a Dime.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This day while traveling home on 295 S from Baltimore to Bladensburg I looked in the sky when I was around exit I 197 and saw a bright object in the sky shaped like a football.  It was leaning to the right as if it was in the kickoff position.  It looked as if it was the smoke of a plane but the definition was too detailed on both ends. And the smoke never got dense from the air.  It was 350000 feet and was huge in size. It was as if you could see through the lines of smoke.  It stayed still and did not move.  I called my wife on my cell phone and told her what I was seeing.  I told her it is not moving. Then it moved staight down after I had watched it for 5 to 10 minutes. I lost sight of it because of the trees by the highway.  So I hung up on the cell with my wife and told her I would call her if I seen it again.  Miraculously, when I got near to my exit to get off I seen it right in fron of the place where we live.  I quickly called my wife and told her to look out the window and tell me what she sees. She saw it and was amazed.  I told her to keep an eye on it until I got home because I was almost there. When I got to the front of the apartment where we stay, she was on the balcony of the 8th floor watching the object.  She told me it had just went out of view.  She descibes a CIGAR SHAPED OBJECT, very bright luminus object, speeding up and then slowing down in mid air before going out of view.  I know it was not from here because we saw this object from different angles and I contend it was shaped like a football and she saw a Cigar shaped object from the 8th floor apartment.  With these two calculations I contend that the object was a disk shaped object that moved unlike anything we had ever seen in our lives.  It is almost unexplainable what we saw.  This was the real thing.  I first reported this incident on a sight called LUNA but the sight is now gone and it disappeared 1 day after I reported it on that sight.  We called TV beroadcast stations,the police(who told us to call the pentagon), The Pentagon, and reported it on the LUNA sight.<n>

I left St Louis MO.,about 22:30 on 02/24/2004, heading east on I-70 in Missouri,I was about 3 hours out of St Louis on I-70 east,about Emma,Mo. Somewhere Between exit 66 and exit 62. It was a dark clear night if I remember correctly,then all of a sudden I noticed these very bright blue strobe lights flashing just a few hundred feet north of the interstate.The object was about 200 to 300 feet off of the ground not moving or making any sound at all that I could tell. The Blue lights would all flash at the same time very quickly.I think that there were about four of these blue lights,but when they lit up I could just make out a very large object.I am not sure if it was one object or two very close together,or the shape of it.I pulled off at the next exit about half a mile east of where I was from the UFO to see if i could get a better look at it,I looked at it for about ten minutes. It was still in the same place lights flashing not moving or making any sound.Whatever it was it was very large! It was still there when I left.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I wasn&#39;t going to submit this one, thinking it must be a satellite or something since I&#39;ve seen it twice now, but I see that this triangular light formation is becoming increasingly sighted and thought I would submit it because of that reason.  The circular lights were large and white (with possibly a faint yellow hue), flying in a perfect triangular formation. The lights did not blink, but were steady on. This time, there were two lights on the top row, and one on the bottom row, unlike last time when there were two on the bottom and one on top.  It was flying in the same direction as I reported last time, which was Southeast, but they were too far away for me to see if they were on some type of aircraft.  There was no noise.  I just watched them from my bedroom window (same one as last time), having just gone upstairs to get ready for bed.  Could this be a satellite? I can&#39;t otherwise explain how I would see the exact same thing going in the same direction, same speed, etc. from my bedroom window twice in 3 months.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

This continued for several minutes and was even called into the tribal police station.  Several people did hear the report over their personal scanners.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Tribal police did eventually try and drive to the area but with no success.

2/24/04 22:00|Paisley (UK/Scotland)||Disk||Several nights in a row, unsual hovering lights in the sky, flashing red, white, blue flashing on a wide object in the sky.|3/2/04|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/035/S35275.html|46|ndxe200402| Several nights in a row, unsual hovering lights in the sky, flashing red, white, blue flashing on a wide object in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On the night of February 23rd (2004), while taking the dog out the backdoor, i was looking up into the sky to pass the time while waiting. While doing so i noticed an unsual set of lights high in the sky at some distance, being near a flight path normally this would be assosciated with being a plane, however the object did not move in any direction, just sort of hovered, and was far to high to be a warning light on a tower. After going back inside i called on my brother (12) to come have a look to see if he saw the same as me. The lights were still stationary. I ruled out it being a plane as it stayed in this position  for around an hour, after a while of watching i went away from the window and later went back (bout an hour and half after originally seeing it, the light were no longer there). The object consisted of a bright white light that spanned the breadth of the object, with blue and red flashing lights, the white light also appeared to flicker. The next night was Tues 24th, i normally go out drinking with all the people from work on a tues and it was around twenty past ten and i went to wait on my bus at the road behind my house to go into town to meet them. In the sky in a near position to the night before was the same light patttern, i watched for around ten minutes while waiting on my bus, again there was no directional movement of the object. After getting on the bus i couldnt see it from the bus, i mentioned it to my mates but they just laughed. This night however the object seemed bigger than before only slightly, indicating it was a bit nearer this time. Tonight (Wednesday 25th February) i was working in the next village at the Burger King, and around half ten i was taking some rubbish bags out to the skip at the rear of the shop, on my return i could see again a similar formation of lights in the sky, much clearer than before, but still at some distance, being directly under the flight path now i had to wait to check for movement, again no significant motion just hovering! , i shouted the other two workers from inside hte shop to look, both agreed there was the white light spanning the breadthe with red and blue flashing lights, but immediatley dismissed it as a plane. I told them to come back in ten minutes, and it would still be there. Sure enough ten minutes later it still was. However they just laughed at me and said &#34;haha how do ya think its a ufo? haha&#34;. When bein driven home i continued to watch the lights, when home i again asked my brother (12) to come look, but also my mum and other brother (18) to come look, all agreed that it was very unusual. We al looked through a monocular (best of what was at hand) i had it focused on the light, there seemed to be a saucer like shape with white light round the rim, and red (and some blue) flashing lights. It had a hovering motion. Note that this night it was in a different part of the sky, just a slight more west than the previous nights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> &gt; I am twenty almost twenty one, currently studyin for a BA(hons) in Graphic Communication at Napier University in Edinburgh. I do graphic design outside of University in my own time doing small jobs as i learn the techniques at University. I also work part-time as a Supervisor at Burger King (It pays for me to get to Univerity). I have had a great interest in UFOs and UFOlogy for some time now, currently have been tryin to be more serious in attempts to research the subject, with aims of being a serious UFOlogist, it is something that fascinates me greatly. In the summer while on a trip to the Canada and the US i will be visiting Roswell, NM and Aztec, NM, and also the towns near Area 51. While there, in particular in Roswell, i plan to conduct several interviews, which i am trying to set up, i really hope to speak to Dennis Balthaser about his work and experience of interception as he refers to it.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was stationary for some time but, started moving. It appeared to start moving very slowly and appeared as just a large star. As it moved closer it emitted large sparks. I would estimate it about the size of a car. I couldn&#39;t make out any distinguishing features only that it was a yellowish/white color light ball.  It was about 50ft high in the air and wobbled back and forth a bit.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first glance I thought it was a helicopter with problems but, as it became closer it was apparent it was not such a craft because it had no noise nor as big as a helicopter. It sped up by the time it reached the other side of the property and made a directional turn northwards. The sparking was occasional and rained down on the trees below.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My parents were also witnesses to this event.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date may be approximate, although the witness does not indicate that fact.

It was a very clear night and i could see all the stars very distant though and the moon which was very bright that night, when this very very bright light caught my attention in the sky and i first thought it might have been a plane (as i see planes out of my window all the time because heathrow airport is only a couple of miles from my house which is the busiest international airport in the world) or an extremely bright unusual star because it seemed so low not more than 10,000 feet probably as my guess becuase i could see planes flying over this object, this was very weird!! so i focused my attention on this orb (for want of a better word) anyway all of a sudden it starts moving left and right and up and down dimming and coming back to full strength in brightness which would make you squint it was so bright, thats when i absoluteley cringed in fright i sat up in bed and my heart was in my mouth i could not beleive what i was seeing. i have seen a lot of shows on these things and beleive in them having witnessed another sighting in 1995 in seattle. but this sighting lasted for four nights i could not sleep a wink that is the truth this was witnessed by two other people on the following nights to back up my story cause i thought i must have been seeing things but when it came back for 3 more nights this is more than proof of these objects.<n> <n><n> <n><n> the thing is that this was so low and there were no clouds in the sky heathrow radar and other people must have picked this up and seen it i just hope that they get in touch with mr davenport at nuforc i will keep a look out for this this things and see if it comes back but believe me watch the sky&#39;s these things are real and quite frightning when you do not know what there intentions are, i will keep you informed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Possibly a celestial body.

I have never seen anyting like this in the past but I cant say for sure that it was one single object. I was looking at the sky (South, South East) at approximately 8:56 pm EST when I saw two rapidly pulsating lights just appear - approximately 3 inches apart in the sky. These lights were pulsating in a sequence of 3 rapid bursts, a slight pause, and then 3 more rapid bursts. Most air craft are displaying a regular and consistant blinking of the light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The intersting part of this is that the lights maintained the exact same distance apart (from my perspective) during the entire time they traveled thru my field of vision ( my field of vision was quite large ). The speed at which they were traveling seemed much faster than the average air craft. If, in fact this was one object traveling thru the sky, it must have been moving at an increadable rate of speed and must have been extremely large.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I looked up to see it passing overhead. Then I noticed out of the corner of my eye, a flash of color in the sky to my far right. I turned and looked to see a green ball of light with an orange tail shooting from west to east at an altitude of about 20,000 ft. It was the size of a pea at arms length. There were low gray clouds, but this green ball was below them. There was no sound, and after 3 seconds, it just vanished. The jet was traveling from southwest to northeast almost directly to where I first noticed the ball of light. Austin Bergstrom International Airport is about 24 miles east of my house. It reminded me exactly of the green ball that shoots out of a roman candle firework except the tail was short and orange. It looked a lot like a meteor that just enters the sky and burns up in the atmoshpere. I didn&#39;t think much of the sighting until I read your site with the mutiple sightings of about the exact same thing that I saw that day.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was a clear cold day the sky was bordering on very pale blue to white. Sometimes the object would look black next to the brightness of the background sky and as it moved it would appear metalic. The object was silent and didn&#39;t appear to be moving from side to side although i think it was but very slowly indeed if at all it was. The most interesting thing was the other movements it made. The object seemed to be very slowly moving in a circular way as if piveted in the middle. It&#39;s hard to explain really, because of the shape sometimes it would appear like a rod but as it moved round you could only see one end of the rod so then it would appear small and circular. It wasn&#39;t changing shape but it seemed that way due to the smooth movements it was making. It seemed big ang close but as there was only sky around it was hard to determine the size and distance away from me. I live in a busy town so i&#39;m sure somebody must have seen it. The object then seemed to become very small very quickly but I still wouldn&#39;t say it changed shape but moved very high in the sky with undescribable speed giving the illusion that it had become smaller. When it was moving as if on a pivet it would move slowly in a circular movement but only for about 90 degrees then it would move back the opposite direction. It wasn&#39;t a balloon. Has anyone seen anything similar?<n>

You could see it burning entering the earths atmosphere with the longest tail i have ever seen, and i watched the last meteor shower in its entirity and never saw anything resembling this. it traveled about 10ft then expoloded. After that it traveled about 25 more feet and exploded again and the the show was over.  My father in law works for nasa and has confirmed no humans in space at that time with the excepition of the space station which moved over head aprox. 30 min prior.

2/22/04 21:00|Stone Ridge|NY|Oval|7 minutes|Slow moving red lights descended, disappeared then reappeared and ascended; dogs barked at them.|1/19/05|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/041/S41160.html|60|ndxe200402| Slow moving red lights descended, disappeared then reappeared and ascended; dogs barked at them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At approximately 21:00 during the last week in February of this year (I just now found out I could report this here) I was on my back porch talking on the phone with a friend and my 2 labrador retrievers were in the back yard.  Suddenly I noticed an oval shaped set of reddish, ethereal lights approaching from the southwest just above the treeline about 100 yards from me. There was no sound associated with this low, slow moving multiple red light object.  The woods behind my house are my property in all directions for at least a mile and there are no buildings on the property except my home. Both dogs began to bark like mad and started running toward where the light was descending. My nearest neighbor lives 3/4 of a mile away and I have almost no light intereference because Stone Ridge is rural.  In fact, I live only 8 miles from where Whitley Streiber used to have his upstate cabin (Accord, NY).  In fact, I spoke on the phone with Mr. Streiber several years ago and after talking for about an hour he confirmed that I was witnessing multiple viewings of UFO&#39;s.  Anyway, the dogs gave some chase towards the reddish object which consisted of 6 or 7 lights which I could not determine if they were separate from each other because of the strange &#34;ethereal&#34; glow the emitted They did move in complete unison though.  The glow was confusing.  The lights lowered all the into the woods (definitely on my property) and then I couldn&#39;t see them.  Meanwhile I was describing to my friend on the phone exactly what I was seeing because I couldn&#39;t believe it. I lost sight of the lights once they dipped into the woods and the dogs relaxed their barking and I wasn&#39;t about to go into the woods to go see for myself what it was because it was too weird.  I kept talking to my friend about it and I described it to her and kept talking about  it when about 6 or 7 minutes later (maybe less time went by but not too much) the exact same silent 6 or 7 weird glowing reddish hazy orbs all lifted up again to just above the tree level and floated off the way it came.  When it lifted up the dogs started going berserk again but they stopped short of chasing into the woods too.  When I went back into the house my husband wanted to know what on earth had made the dogs make so much noise barking and I told him what had happened and he told me that I had just imagine the lights.  Well, I didn&#39;t imagine them.  It&#39;s the 3rd time I&#39;ve seen similar lights while walking my dogs in our back field but this was the only time they descended and then ascended again.  I went into the woods the next day when it was light out (obviously) and checked around to see if I could see anything unusual on the ground but I found nothing and my woods are pretty remote and I was kind of freaked out, even in the daytime with the dogs (who didn&#39;t seem to sniff at anything overly either).  So, I got out of there fairly fast because I&#39;ve heard that some people have seen &#34;greys&#34; in broad daylight in Stone Ridge and I think I&#39;d be scared to death if I saw something in daylight that I couldn&#39;t expain.   In closing I just wish to say that if I have ever been abducted I have no memory of it but I believe that my younger son may have been.  He&#39;s too young to talk to about it.  It scares me though.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date of sighting is approximate.  PD))<n>
2/22/04 20:04|Stony Brook|NY|Circle|5 seconds|Brilliant reddish-orange object with green tip; hovering then ascending at impossible speed|10/30/06|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/052/S52921.html|61|ndxe200402| Brilliant reddish-orange object with green tip; hovering then ascending at impossible speed<n> <n><n> <n><n> On the night of February 22, I had just pulled into the parking lot of the Borders books store and was finishing a cellphone conversation with my father. After about 10 minutes or so, I happened to glance out my car window and noticed an intensely bright, self luminous, circular object which had the appearance of being set ablaze with an electrically charged reddish-orange fire. My first impression was that I was looking at the afterburner of an extremely close range F-15 or F-18, but I was confused as to how the object could remain stationary and why the flame didn&#39;t taper to a point. I could hear nothing. It hovered motionlessly for about 3 seconds; during which time small flecks of golden colored light began to appear within it. The red light then pulsated and the object accelerated up and away from my point of observation on a northwestern trajectory. The acceleration occurred in two distinct stages. Stage one was incredibly fast and stretched a band of neon-like red light across the sky. Stage two was even faster as the tip of the object became green and what had previously been small golden flecks of light now also became stretched to form very narrow but sharp edged lines within the larger red band. Finally, as if someone had stretched and let go of a rubber-band, the tail end caught up with the tip as it vanished from sight hooking down slightly at the last moment. The entire event lasted approximately 5 seconds, but it still left me sitting in my car trembling a bit.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About a month later, I became so interested in what had happened that I decided to get some detailed maps of the area behind the Borders store front and check out what was back there. I roughly estimated the objects distance and began tracing my line of sight with a pencil. At 3 miles from my point of observation the pencil came to rest on the Stony Brook Nuclear Structure Laboratory. Naturally, this peaked my interest as I had already suspected that whatever I saw was plasma related. I&#39;ve since spoken with a few of the professors who operate that facility and they&#39;ve stated firmly that their equipment couldn&#39;t possibly have produced any energy related phenomenon outside of the building.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Having said that, I am now certain of five things that the object was not 1)It was not some ridiculously strange experiment of S.N.S.L. 2)It was not a meteor (it remained motionless for 3 seconds and ascended). 3)It was not a reflection in my car window or a hallucination (I&#39;ve since found an independent NUFORC witness who saw it) 4)It was not a plane (impossible speed and hovering) 5)It was not a naturally occurring plasma phenomenon (perfectly circular shape and rapid acceleration) So what was it? Well, whatever it was, it seemed to express an interest in the Stony Brook Nuclear Structure Laboratory. There remains the possibility of coincidence. But the more I investigate this phenomenon the more I uncover a direct link between these objects and all things nuclear. This suggests definite intent. Whether or not extra-terrestrials are involved is a separate issue, but I now believe that these objects are physical, technological, and intelligently controlled.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

They were approaching the new home of their neighbors, Bryce and Michelle Moss on Corinth Road, when they saw something in the sky to their left.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Sparks which appeared to be several inches long were coming from the unknown object in the sky. Carrie Martin said it was just high enough to cross over utility lines. It crossed the road and struck a tree on the Moss property.<n> <n><n> <n><n> &#34;There was a car directly behind us so we couldn&#39;t just stop,&#34; she said. They turned around after a short distance and returned to the scene. &#34;It was in the tree,&#34; Mrs. Martin said. They could still see the sparks and the &#34;ground was catching fire.&#34;  They drove to Bryce and Michelle Moss&#39;s present home and reported the situation to them. Mrs. Martin dialed 911 and got Union County Communications Department who advised they call on a &#34;land line.&#34; Mrs. Moss called Cherokee Communications who said they had already been notified by Union County.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The incident occurred about 6:15 Sunday night, Mrs. Martin says.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The Corinth Volunteer Fire Department answered the call and extinguished the fire. Chief Doug Bowers said that after a conversation with the eyewitnesses, fire department personnel shined a light into the top of a tree where the object crashed. Chief Bowers said departmental personnel spotted a shiney object about 20 feet off the ground in the tree. The object appeared to be about six inches wide, Chief Bowers said.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Cherokee Communications Department contacted the Federal Aviation Administration who said they had had no reports of any plane in the area having any difficulty.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Bowers said FAA officials said they had no idea what had been spotted in the skies of rural Cherokee County. &#34;They called it a &#39;headscratcher&#39;,&#34; Bowers said.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Carrie Martin said she and her husband went back to the scene on Monday but could not find the shiney object in the tree. Too, they checked the brush area which had burned and found nothing suspicious.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Mrs. Martin said she wondered if what fell could not have been some piece of the experimental objects that are placed in the atmosphere by the United States or some other government.<n> <n><n> <n><n> But for the time being, nobody knows what fell through the Cherokee County sky and crashed into a Corinth tree Sunday night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> www.thecherokeechronicle.com     Addtional articals/video can be found here. http://www.newschannel7online.com/servlet/Satellite?pagename=WSPA%2FMGArticle%2FSPA_BasicArticle&amp;c=MGArticle&amp;cid=1031773853119&amp;path=!reports!topstories  (artical)    http://www.thecarolinachannel.com/news/2868221/detail.html<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We express our gratitude to The Cherokee Chronicle for the article, and to the individual who submitted the information to our Center.

I was traveling on Hwy 380 traffic was light. Off to my left, south toward where Lake Dallas is at I noticed a round brite light slowly rising. This area is also has and is used for landing traffic at DFW airport. At first I figured it was just a helicopter no biggy then this light or whatever shot from my left across to my right in mere seconds and nothing travels that fast. I stopped on the shoulder and grabbed some bincluars to see if I could get a better look. It stopped and hovered off in the distance for a few seconds the zoomed away at a forty to forty five degree angle north and was gone with in three seconds. Distance I first saw it was five to seven mile away crossed in front of me two the three miles ahead and again stopped I would say ten miles north then zoom off The area is all rural trees and pasture land. I know military aircraft and this was not one of them I would stay the altitude was 1000 to 1500 feet A few moments later I crossed the Trinty river which empties into lake Dallas and wonder if this was where it had crossed. Now north is another lake, Lake Roberts. Wish I could be more helpful, but it happen so fast!<n>

(Leader, one on right and three on left). I was surprised that they were so easily observed at night. Then they were gone. I walked around the corner of the building to see if I could see them and nothing to see. Then it dawned on me that they covered an arc of view (~ 50 degrees) in about 5 seconds. Also dawned on me that the formation was perfect and the illuminated bottom of the birds was too perfect.(My initial surprise was .. Ghee, I can see a flight of geese at night.) The rate of airspeed had to be in excess of 500mph or faster. The size of each bird was the same as the width of my fingertip at arms length.  I see lots of flights of geese past here but not that fast. The AF jets showing off for the USAF Academy don&#39;t cover that much sky. No noise. No change of image. I don&#39;t know what I saw but it wasn&#39;t a flock of geese.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Upon reflection, I believe they were shaped like isosceles triangles, perhaps individual ones or maybe iso triangels on the bottom of one big thing I couldn&#39;t see.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Whatever it/they were, they initially struck me as a flock of geese. Oh, the winds at altitude weren&#39;t great enough to allow a flock of geese to go that fast because the clouds just weren&#39;t moving.

The sky in Portland was clear and dry except for the jet trails overhead which had obscured parts of the clear blue with some agglomerating cloud cover.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I hardly go anywhere without a digital camera these days. I snapped lots of sky pictures as aircraft trails intrigue me, especially on a rare otherwise clear day.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Several pictures were quite interesting. The one attached here had a plane approaching passing to my right which I remember seeing, and a green spot, possibly a lens flare, which I don&#39;t remember seeing. So I decided to look a bit closer at it to discover what may have caused the green spot. Also, this picture is under exposed to highlight the sky details, a trick I learned a while back.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The clouded parts of the sky on that day had some weird shaped circular or oval tracers cut into them, some quite clear which I have other pictures of from 2-20-2004. This intrigued me further to see what I could learn about the green spot. After all, it&#39;s not every day you are dealt a green spot in a photo (or maybe it is, you decide).<n> <n><n> <n><n> I made a copy of it (-2) and cropped out an area, because in the original image I thought I saw what could be a circular or oval tracer near the green spot.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I then solarized a copy (-3) and you can plainly see the green spot (now turned magenta) appears to be leaving some kind of trail &#34;behind&#34; itself, coming off of a circular tracer. If you look closer, it appears there may be even more objects and circular tracers. Maybe, maybe not. They may just be artifacts of the enhancement program.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There appear to be in close proximity two other similar, or the same, objects flanking the circular tracer. Of course, that is my guess, and they may just be spots in the clouds. Or maybe not. The green spot is making me think &#34;adolescent showing off to its buddies&#34; for some reason. I mean, what with impending springtime and all.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The spot in the upper left is the sun illuminated cloud cover.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Just thought I would brighten your day a wee bit. I am a novice at this and don&#39;t know how to get more out of this photo. Maybe you can, or know someone who can.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Brian Vike, Director HBCC UFO Research Phone 1 250 845 2189 email: hbccufo@telus.net Website: http://www.hbccufo.com<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We express our gratitude to Brian Vike for submitting this report.

The light was circular and moving quite quickly. It was not an aircraft as it had no navigation lights, beacon or strobe light. After about 30 seconds another similar light appeared. This continued and we counted nine lights that appeared from beyond the hill at regular intervals and headed out to sea in a North Westerly direction. It was difficult to estimate the size of the light as its distance from us was unclear. The lights stayed the same orange colour while we watched them. Eventually we could see all nine outlined against the stars as  they began to get fainter and eventually disappeared from sight. There was no sound associated with the lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Third ship was bigger than those two described above and had more lights located at the edges.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Objects were flying in &#39;V&#39; formation and was looking marvelous...

It was rotating like a spinning globe, with a tilt. After 2 min of watching this, it started moving in the same direction as before. Just then a cop car pulled up to see what we were doing. As my husband was talking to the police officers, I continued to watch it slowly move and flicker, almost like it was burning out. Then from the bottom of it, a glowing orange small object fell. As my husband was trying to explain and show them where it was, it had vanished. They then joked with us, thought we were lying. Then drove off.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous.  PD))<n>

The sun had gone down; however, the sky was still fairly light.  As I sat on my front steps looking west, I began to examine the dark clouds that were just hovering above the homes a few miles away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Initially, I didn&#39;t think anything about it.  Since we had mild thunderstorms the night prior, I thought the objects were lingering storm clouds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I continued to look in their direction (as the sky became grandually darker), the objects began to lose their cloud-like appearance.  The became metalic.  The new appearance was dark grey (very dark); however, they were not black.  I could tell that they were just a few shades lighter than a solid black color.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Their appearance was similar to that of our U.S. Military/Airforce&#39;s flat grey paint.  There were no reflective surfaces.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I have indicated below, the crafts were in a five degree spread formation.  I will use the X to depict how they were positioned in the sky:  x     XXXXX      xxxxxxXXXXVXXXXxxxxxx      XXXXX      xxxxxxXXXXVXXXXxxxxxx  The single X represents what appeared to be a cubed like craft--it was the smallest of the five.  The five X&#39;s represent what appeared to be a tubular craft.  The most interesting, were the larger crafts.  These were shaped (from my vantage point) similar to that of a hawk or eagle as it floats in the sky awaiting prey.  If you were to take a head-on shot of either bird prior to its dive, that is what this larger craft looked like.<n> <n><n> <n><n> These larger craft was positioned firmly in the sky, traveling about 5-6 mph.  The wings of the craft were flapping slowly, much like a bird of prey.  The wings were several hundred yards long (tip to tip).<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I called my wife to help me identify these crafts, each craft began to slowly fade.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When my wife walked to the steps, the smaller craft took-off.  From the nearly motionless position, to several thousand miles per hour (much like a shooting star).  My wife screamed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The tubular craft on the far right, began to slowly fade.  Then, the larger craft on the far right began to fade.  The transition was slow and deliberate.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The tubular craft on the far left, began to fade once the larger craft on the right faded.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The last remaining craft (one of the bird like crafts), just seem to sit there.  I got the impression that it knew we were stairing at it.  We could feel something staring back at us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I wanted to get a better look, since we couldn&#39;t find a camera.  We jumped in our vehicle, and drop up the hill toward where the final craft was positioned.  Once we got there, it began to fade as well.  We saw the final transition.  It went from an extremely large bulky craft to a transparent (which isn&#39;t a adequate expression).  The craft appeared to blend into the sky.  We could now see a camouflaged craft that had lights/dim orange lights completely surrounding the outline of its shape.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The lights were very orange.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What was once a bulky bird-like craft, became fluid limber well camouflaged craft that seemed to glide much like a stingray in the ocean.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was like watcing fluid in motion as this craft twirled (as if it were displaying its prowess) in the sky.  Within a second, it went straight up, and was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Needless to say, my wife and I could not do anything else for the rest of the night.  We just sat there watching the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> One interesting point, when we were jumping into the vehicle to chase the craft, we decided to take the family dog.  The dog didn&#39;t want to go outside (this is a dog that runs to the door when it hears the lock click--he&#39;s always game for the outdoors).  He was scared of something.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My background is military, two science degrees, own businesses, and consider myself normal (both mentally and pysically).  My wife has a science background, and is an executive with a prominent medical corporation.  We are a grounded family.<n> <n><n> <n><n> These things were real, and there was a threat present.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I was parked out of the town near other RV&#39;s, there for the winter RV show.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About an hour before sunset, I looked out my window south, to see a huge circular &#34;ring &#34;in the sky, over the town, more south west.  This was HUGE, many times over the size of a jet or airplane..  It had what looked like black smoke oulining it, with nothing inside.  What it looked like ,was a UFO type craft, but with the black outlining only.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I ran outside with my binoculars to look, though I could see it very plain without them.  I had no camera to take a picture!  I was trying to get a better veiw of two objects that looked to be parachutes just below the circular &#34;smoke&#34;ring.  The two  objects below the &#34;ring&#34; looked like something was attached.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I ran over to an RV to my left and behind me, to tell them.   At that time, it was still quite visible.  I was wondering, had a plane blew up???  Had someone parachuted out?  But the huge outline, amazed me, as it was in the pattern of a craft, much larger than that a plane, many times!<n> <n><n> <n><n> So I told the RV  people who had recently pulled nearby me. They had been drinking, (I had not) they laughed, and asked had I been to Roswell?  They did not seem concerned nor wanting to even look, so I left.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Back at my RV, I looked again, just a bit of &#34;smoke&#34;remained.  From the RV to my right came a woman to see what I was looking at.  She saw some of the remaining &#34;smoke&#34; or outline of the ring.  It had been in the sky some time, about ten minutes approx.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I asked in town the next day about any reports, any accidents of aircraft, none that I could hear of. There is a surveillence balloon  south near Yuma.  I have seen it for years.  It was further south, and east of what I saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The parachute objects may have been local ultralights.  If so they should have seen what I saw, unless they did not look up!<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was not going to report this, until I saw the photo from Texas, March 04 on the Coast to Coast Website.  It was similar to what I saw!  So I am! reporting it.  I did hear about a UFO report that went unreported in Jan.  It was in the same area, but it was a craft, whereas what I saw was the &#34;outline&#34; of what looked like one.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>
2/20/04 15:25|Lewisville|TX|Unknown|seconds|Series of Sonic Booms over Southern Denton County just north of Dallas|3/2/04|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/035/S35204.html|80|ndxe200402| Series of Sonic Booms over Southern Denton County just north of Dallas<n> <n><n> <n><n> At about 3:25 I was sitting in my home office when I heard a loud boom and the windows rattled. A few seconds later a second boom hit and rattled the windows about the same. I wondered if there was some sort of huge metal dumpster or something that fell off a truck near the house but couldn&#39;t believe that would rattle the windows like that. Less than a minute later my father who lives about 8-9 miles west of me called me on the phone. He asked if I heard the sonic booms. I said yeah but I didn&#39;t know what they were. I had not heard a sonic boom in over 30 years and wondered about that. I immediately hung the phone up and ran outside to look in the sky. I observed at least 7 or 8 contrails going across the sky mostly from east to west or west to east, as I could not see the end of them. But I noticed that to the North Northwest there was one contrail that made a hairpin turn and headed back north. I thought that might have been the source since it would probably be a military craft that made that maneuver. Then about 25 to 30 minutes later I was in my car about to start it when my cell phone rang. As I was answering it I heard a smaller boom but it was distinctly the same as early just much quieter. At that moment I said hello and it was my father again, he asked if I heard the sonic boom again. I said I just heard it as I was answering the phone. I then asked him how long ago he heard it and he said about 30 seconds before I answered the phone. So since he lives about 8 miles west of me we figured that the sound was also west of me since it took at least 30-40 seconds for the sound to travel to me. Then later that evening I took my son to meet with the Boy Scouts to go camping. While the boys were all loading up their gear I told the story to one of the boy&#39;s fathers who is retired air force and now works for the air force in civil service. He was in Dallas at the time and did not hear it but a mother of another boy said she heard 3 booms like me and another boys father said he heard it ! and though somebody must have been dynamiting something. The lady lived about half way between me and my father while the other boy&#39;s father lives right on Lake Grapevine about 12 miles west of me and about 3-4 miles southwest of my father. When I got home that night after dropping my son off with the scouts, I called my father to tell him what I had heard from others. He then told me that my mother had heard the sonic booms also. She was in the front yard at my brother&#39;s house about 12 miles north northwest of me and about 7 to 8 miles north of my father. She said she heard the first two booms that were close together but was probably driving in the car when the third one hit so she did not hear it. I just now called her to ask her if she saw anything and she said she did not but thought that the sound was north of them but could not be certain. She also said that a neighbor asked if she heard the sonic booms and she said she did. He said he heard them and called DFW airport to report them and the airport said they did not hear them.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The firts siting occurance took place at 2:00am around Feb. 22, 2004.  the locatiopn of the house is in the middle of nowhere so it is unlikely that it was people.  The only person who saw this light was my grandmother so this part is second hand.  She claims that she woke up around 2 o&#39;clock in the morning by a blood red light flashing in her room, she stated that the light was only there for about 3 min.  there was no sound. the way the room is situated on the bottom cornor of the house she could see the lights in her bathroom window and side window, she claims that it light the hole room up like a roman candle.  that after noon i went to the area were there might have been tracks and could not find any.<n> <n><n> <n><n> the second occurance took place the same day that night.  i was out in the guest house with my brother watching TV.  my brother had already gone to bed and was sleeping across the room. when i went to bed it turned off the lights in the house and left the tv on so i could watch a little more.  a few min later a yellow light flashed out side the kitchenette window and light up the small one room house i did not take into consideration that it might have been a UFO because a drivewa runs right behind the house and i dismissed it as the neighbor, but the only thing that got me to rethink me evaluation was the absence of noise from the hole event.  if you have seen anything like this win south Alabama or west Florida during this time please post your siting report.<n> <n><n> <n><n> i dont know how much this has to do with the siting but just a few days later i had a wierd dream that i was standing in a field and i could feel the wind blowing, i was looking up in the sky watching the stars and a pllane flew into view as the plane reached the center of my sight an object behind the plane light up vvery brightly causing me to squint. the object was a circular craft with lights that spun around the craft it manuvered itself over the plane witch light up appearing to be a boeing 747 (i live in Savannah, GA so i know the difference in a UFO and an airplane of any type) then another hugh flash of light and the Plane was gone and the UFO fle woff at a great speed to my left in the dream at a great rate of speed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

My  husband said maybe it is some deerhunters. A couple of night later I had walked down to my sons house across my pasture and when I was coming back the mist was rising in the pasture with a large area obstructing the stars.  Out of the mist above me I saw a horizontal beam of light like a laser shining out of it. It scared me and I ran on into the house.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On the night of the 19th my son called me to come outside. I can see his home from my front yard and he was standing on the deck. He said &#34;look down at the pond&#34;. The pond is downhill from my house in the middle of my pasture with the tree reserve on the backside of it. A very bright light was shining down into the pond; so bright that I couldn&#39;t see the source. My son said, &#34; I have been watching it for 20 minutes.&#34; In just a few minutes the light went out and triangle shaped caraft was lifting up!!! It turned toward my house and lifted its nose and slowly acclerated upward.  It was making a pumping sound like an old washing machine for a few seconds then became absolutely quiet. It had the white corner lights and orangish light in the center. After reaching an altitude of a couple hundred feet all the lights went out and small red blinking light came on. As it flew off it you could no longer tell what it was. With the linking red light it now looked like any plane that would be crossing the night sky. I don&#39;t know if the other 2 events have anything to do with this but it all happpened in the same week.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

That is until I went to put the garbage can out by the edge of the road. Off to the north west was a very bright circular object, 2 to 3 times brighter a larger than the north star.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I watched this object it slowly moved to the north. All of a sudden, it took off like a rocket for about a half a second. It slowed down, then it started moving south. It slowly moved south for a few seconds then it turned moving back towards the north again. At times it would be like it was hanging in the night sky swinging like a pendulum. It would go in all directions, like someone scribbling on a piece of paper. It also had faint blinking colors such as you would see with the stars. Occasionally you could see what looked liked a tail from a comet.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At about 9:45 Eastern time I walked back outside and the object was nowhere in sight. Another thing I should point out is that my nephew said he has seen it for the last couple of days. Even first thing in the morning when they were heading to school. I don&#39;t know If anybody else has seen such an object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Additional information:  The object was low in the sky, taking a guess would say at a level of approx. 25 to 30 deg. This morn. I woke up about 4:45 to get ready for work. And the object is back in the sky. This time at a more easterly direction and at an approx. angle of about 60 deg.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was no indication of any type of craft, even through our telescope it only looked like a circular bright, white light with blinking colors(red, green, and blue.) The tail I was speaking of was not visible at all times. It would just appear randomly. Even through the telescope you could just make out the tail occasionally.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Brian Vike, Director HBCC UFO Research Phone 1 250 845 2189 email: hbccufo@telus.net Website: http://www.hbccufo.com<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We express our gratitude to Brian Vike for submitting this report.

The night was a very clear one.  Many Many stars were out to look at.  We live on the outskirts of our town, so lights from the town are at a minimum.  My Brother was the first to see the bright object.  He said that out to the west above a tree line he seen a 3 bright pale orange light appear. They were about a quarter of the size of a full moon, but not nearly as bright.  They appeared for 2 seconds at a 45 degree angle going from bottom left to top right.  Then it just blinked out.  By that time he all ready told me and my wife.  We started looking in the general location and in about 2 minutes 3 more bright pale orange lights appeared.  Not all at once but like 1 then 2 then three.  They were also at a 45 degree angle going from bottom left to top right.  They were the same size as the first one and in the same location.  There was about the same size again between the lights.  This lasted for about 10 seconds then those turned off all at once.  About another 2 minutes later another bright pale orange light appeared in the same location and being about the same size.  This one stayed for about 2-3 seconds and then split into 2 bright pale orange lights.  It reminded me of Ronald McDonald doing his letter M with his hands. But of course in a smaller area together.  It even left a sparkling trail when it did its split.  This lasted for 2-3 seconds and then they both turned off.  We waited for another 1/2 hour but there was nothing else in terms of lights.  But there was of course about 3 or 4 Fighter Jets that were circling the same area of the lights just about a minute or two right after the last sighting.  This also happened last week on Thursday and at the same time and location.  Same size bright pale orange light that just appeared and stayed for about 3 seconds then turned off.  They did not look like anything that we have seen before.  They did not look like fireworks or Flares.  These lights were in one position.  They did not float downward like fireworks or flares.  We are very curious to know what we seen.<n>

We think it was in the shape of a triangle. It went across the road and went down below tree level. The intersection of River and Orishal is about 1 mile from Lake Michigan. The thing we saw seemed pretty big, as big as an airliner, but completely black and it made no noise that we could hear. We were approximately 300 feet from it. Anyway, we saw something, and I want to know if anyone else reported this object.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

At first it looked like the backdraft of a jet, but there was no smoke and it was traveling all together, no trail of smoke was left behind. It was reddish orange and there seemed to be a small black dot in front of the red line. The best way to describe the object itself is it looked like a constant streak of light. It was moving southward, too high to be in normal airspace. It was moving very slowly at first, but then gradually sped up, slowed back down, and faded away. The colors never changed, and the object remained intact.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  If the witnesses were not looking at a contrail, illuminated by the setting sun, then we don&#39;t know what they witnessed.

It lit up the ground under it.  There are a lot of night lights there and I have seen that spot a million times without the craft, so I know it well and the craft was not there before or since, that I know of.

It was around 1:20 AM, when for some apparent reason, I decided to turn my head slightly to the left, and I noticed a Green &#34;Flame&#34; traveling downwards towards the Earth. It seemed like an eternity, but it lasted for about 3-5 seconds. It was not zipping by, but it was not floating either, it simply looked as though it was falling down from the sky. It had a very slight trail behind it, the same color as itself. It seemed close, but it wasn&#39;t huge, and it wasn&#39;t small, at least from the brightness aspect. I lost sight of it after it went behind the trees, and it went out of my field of view. I related it as looking most like a Firework &#34;Dud&#34; falling back down. It was so brilliant. I don&#39;t recollect hearing any noise though. I talked to a NASA Astronomer however, and my second assumption seems to fit best. It was a Meteor/Meteorid in my view. I was so shocked though, simply because I didn&#39;t know they came in such fantastic colors. I always thought of them as being Yellow/Orange/Red. According to the Astronomer, it was made up of Nickel. Nickel apparently burns in a Green Color when mixed with Oxygen, and a little Nitrogen, or better put, the Atmosphere. I completely believe it to have been a Meteor/Meteorid. I live in a populated area, with 100,000+ people within a 5-7 mile circle of myself. I seriosuly doubt that anyone else saw it, just because I was blessed to have turned my head for no apparent reason, and see this spectacular celstial event. I do not believe this to be a true U.F.O, because in my belief it was a Meteor. My father has seen Green ones before, and as a matter of fact, my friend saw a Blue one behind his town house a year ago. It is such a scary experience, even my friend admitted that, but it has truly intrigued me, and I am delving further into the field of Astronomy as a Hobby, due to this event. I have always enjoyed this web-site, and I am simply reporting this in case anyone else saw it, and reports it. I have no problem being contacted either, in order to fully describe the event. I am a firm believer in UFO&#39;s, but this to me has a much simpler explanation. Feel free to contact me for more detailed information.<n>

It was probably 2/3 the size of a full moon.  It dropped down at a very fast rate with increased momentum as it fell.  It was like an object falling after having been thrown up in the air. (after the peak and arc of the throw how it comes back down).<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then it went out of my view on the other side of the mountain.  I heard no sound and saw no trail left behind.

I saw overhead what caught my eye as a flash of bright light that appeared to be at first directly above my house.  (Standing on the porch it was directly overhead when it came it&#39;s stopping/ reversing point at that side of it&#39;s pattern.)  Looking up, i saw that the object was actually moving in a kind of back and forth motion over head, so that it looked like it was making a zig-zaging pattern, appearing to be very close overhead above the treetops. It was moving quickly, coming to a stop then making very sharp reversals above so that it seemed to appear and disspear as it moved out of sight beyound what I could see over the roof.  (Hence the &#34;flash&#34; impression that caught my eye).  The object above the lights was dark and hard to see because the lights  were clustered on the bottom that were very bright.  The lights themselves were green, blue white and red in a cluster pattern appearing to be underneath the object. I was not able to see above the lights other than an impression of a shadow, above the lights but I was not able to tell the shape of it.   Mr Davenport asked for a comparision to the full moon in size and I believe that though there was not a full moon here tonight, this would have obscured it if it has passed in front.  There was absolutely no sound from the object.  It appeared to me to be much lower than a normal aircraft would be, appearing to be not much higher than the tops of the elm trees along the edge of the fence.  The object appeared to be moving back and forth quickly and would disappear from view beyond the roof of the house and then reappear because of it’s flight pattern.  This went on for a few minutes.  I lost the object when I went inside to get my camera; when I came back outdoors the object was not visible.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In terms of other conditions, here it was about  20 F outside, and quite clear with many stars visible.  After watching for a few minutes to see if the object would reappear I returned to the house and found my 3 cats VERY excited and agitated though I couldn’t see anything inside that would have caused them to be. (there were very calm and behaving normally beforehand) I heard no noise at all.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with this witness at length, and we were impressed with both her, and her report!

Right after it stopped, it started to get brighter, slightly changing color, but mostly just bigger and brighter.

The object seem to get brighter then it would dim again and then it dimmed out completely.  If it was a plane I would&#39;ve seen it after the light dimmed but nothing was there.

It seemed to be locked in fixed position in the sky. I got out a pair of low powered binoculars and it seemed that there was something going on in the confines of the triangle.

I think I just saw my first UFO! But maybe it was a shooting star, I can&#39;t really be sure...&#34;  Then in the midst of another message she had left minutes later she stopped again and said &#34;What the hell this is freaky I just saw something fly across the sky again really really fast!&#34;  When we spoke the next day she had no idea that I had a sighting the same night in a totally different state.

It usually changes colors and flickers; however it was more blinking that night.  Vivid shades of green, blue, red, amber and yellow were quite visible.  It was about 20-25 degrees above the horizon and very bright that night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At around 7:30pm PST, we were standing on our front porch (facing North) looking at the night sky when we first noticed something strange.  It appeared two red orbs, very small and very far away, almost &#34;spewed&#34; from the Sirius star. (This isn’t actually what prompted me to file this report.)<n> <n><n> <n><n> We watched them move very similar to a plane at first, slowly making their way across the sky. The biggest difference was that the lights weren’t blinking and there was only that red glowing light. It was a bright magenta, though it appeared very far away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We first witnessed one shoot off to the left (West) and take about 45 seconds to move what seemed like a mile or so. It then suddenly appeared to stop in the air, then disappear seconds later.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We weren’t sure what to think of it and decided to get a 2nd opinion. We called my wife’s mother who happened to be out driving on Cook Road (country road about 5 miles away to the Northeast) and asked if she had seen anything. She said no. At this time, we started to witness another red orb that looked exactly like the first, but this time it shot off to the right (East). We asked if she could see it as well and she confirmed it.  It acted very similar to the first one, moving a mile or away from Sirius, then stopping and disappearing. Somewhat stunned and excited, we decided to grab my camera and be ready for the next time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About 10 minutes later my wife’s mother arrived at our house. We talked about what we had seen and decided to keep an eye on it through the front bay window. (It was a cold night so being outside for hours at a time was difficult.) Over the next 45min I ventured in and out; keeping an eye to the sky whenever we weren’t talking.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What happened next is what not only prompted me too make this report, but turned my previously skeptical wife into a believer.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had also called my father since he’s always been interested in UFOs and the paranormal. (He’s also a very smart man. PhD in Psychology licensed Shiatsu therapist, LMT, etc.) While standing just off our front porch in the front walkway and talking to him about the night’s events, I noticed two very clear amber/orange lights moving rather quickly towards us from the North-Northeast; also seeming originating from Sirus. I had been watching the sky the whole time and didn’t see it come up over the foothill. It appeared from nowhere.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first I dismissed it as a plane, but as it came rapidly closer, I realized there were no wings. I yelled for my wife and mother-in-law to come look.<n> <n><n> <n><n> By the time they arrived at my side, the object had moved drastically closer. It now appeared to be maybe a mile away from us at the most. It had only been maybe 10 seconds since I first saw it from what seemed like 20-30 miles away. All three of us just stared up in awe. Within 2-3 seconds, it passed almost above our heads (maybe a few blocks away) at a surprisingly low altitude (couple hundred feet). We got a pretty good look at it… it was cigar shaped with no wings or tailfin or anything. We couldn’t make out the surface, although it looked very dark. There were two lights on it (the amber/orange ones I had seen) that appeared to be on the bottom, plus a dimmer and smaller red light, similar to the orbs we had seen earlier. They lit up the area directly underneath them; apparent by the treetops. The surface of the object didn’t appear to be reflecting the light back at all – it reminded me of a street light color and beam. A kind of floodlight, but controlled.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There were two very distinct things that stuck out in all of our minds. This object was moving *FAST* at first (appearing to travel 20 miles or so in 10-15 seconds), but then slowed down when closer to us, then speeding up again as it went away. The other thing that really surprised us was the lack of sound. It was dead silent. No wind noise, no motor, nothing. It was shooting across the sky at easily 80-90 miles an hour without making a peep! The fact that it appeared so close to us added to the confusion..<n> <n><n> <n><n> We watched it as it flew overhead and eventually out of sight (to the South-Southeast). The time frame from when I first saw it appear to when we couldn’t see the lights anymore was about 30 seconds. We started trying to rationalize what it was. Plane? Nope – no wings or sound. Helicopter? Looked like it *could* of been, though again it was completely silent, plus we never saw the blades or tail light. It was a night we’ll remember for years to come if not for the rest of our lives!   Some quick background information on my wife, me, and my mother-in-law:  I am a computer security professional (own my own consulting business) and have been so for over a decade. I’m very well respected in my field and have always been a perfectionist on the job. I pay a large amount of attention to detail and have been told I’m quite intelligent.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My wife owns her own company as well, manufacturing an up and coming product that a handful of large businesses have shown interest in selling. She has been doing it for about 4 years with a business partner. She is also well respected by her customers and business associates.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My mother-in-law is a volunteer coordinator at the local church and a Boy Scout district commissioner. She is a very particular person when it comes to facts and research. Just like me, she prefers to research all the facts for herself and then make the best educated decision that she can.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thanks for listening and all you do!<n>

I happened to be at her home this particular morning early and remembered the ISS would be coming over around 8 AM.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I stepped out on the porch and waited and recognized it once it came in view.  The sun wasn&#39;t totally up but the sky was light.  This was one of the longest views I&#39;d ever had of it as it crossed the sky in front of her home.  I noticed something strange behind it that I had never seen before.  It was metallic and then realized there were two of these objects.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Neither object wavered or danced in the sky but steadily followed along some distance behind the ISS.  I&#39;d seen the ISS many times both at night and during the day and this seemed strange to me.  I called for my daughter to come out and she saw them also.  What interested me was the steady motion in which they moved..the fact that they seemed to be on course with the ISS.  They weren&#39;t large enough to see first hand what they were but it was quite curious.  I mentioned that it seemed odd something was following the ISS in a perfect line and was prob much farther behind it then it appeared to us.  That night I emailed NASA. I mentioned what we had seen and asked if they could give me any information as to what the objects might have been or if there was some other aircraft in the area at the same time of the sighting.  I really never expected to receive an answer.  However the next day NASA responded.  The man gave his rank and all but I no longer have the email.  He assured me there was nothing in the sky at the time of this sighting in this area or the area around the ISS.  He said the crew had released some silver or met! allic de bris  at some point during the flight.  I think he said bags.  I don&#39;t remember exactly what he called them but the first thing I thought was how in the world would we see a bag from that distance...even if the sun were shining on it?  Compared to the ISS, a bag, as far as I was concerned, would be like an ant there in the sky.  It seemed to me I was getting the standard answer of &#34;debris&#34;.   At any rate I simply responded with a thank you and left it alone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At least I learned there was nothing in the area and I know we did see something following the ISS.  It would have had to have been large for us to see it at that distance.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((ADDENDUM FROM WITNESS))<n> <n><n> <n><n> Sorry....it was around 8 AM...my mistake.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((END ADDENDUM))<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date may be approximate.

In the SW portion of the sky I saw two slightly glowing silver objects in the sky. They where moving up, down, left and right directions in the sky, they began to hover closer and closer to us until they where about 500 to 1000 feet away. Then I heard a real low humming sound and after hearing it for about thirty seconds the two crafts rocketed straight up into the sky out of sight to the naked eye. The crafts where circle shape and when they where close it seemed the outer portion of the crafts where spinning with the center staying in place. I never seen anything like it in my life. Also to note when I saw them near I was going to use my Cell phone to report the crafts but my cell phone all of a sudden had no power or signal.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The objects resebled triangles with a red dot similar to a nuclei near their base. The objects appeared to be moving away in a north easterly direction. During their visability the Objects would revolve around one another and eventually appeared to merge into a singular object ( Possible Angle of Vision responsible ) The &#34;Merged Object&#34; began to move away in an accelerated fassion again in the North Easterly direction. Aproximately 5 minutes after loosing sight of the Objects, a plume with a redish/orange coloration began to appear faintly at a great distance. I would Estimate at the 40,000 Ft+ lvl. This plume began to grow and then out of nowhere a new triangle became visible near the location where the first two were sighted.

The path it took was not straight, but wavered, and then disappeared belowed the treeline. It looked to be traveling straight down, but if it was traveling straight out, would have been traveling at a very fast rate. There was no trail of light behind it, as a shooting star would have.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I expected to see a flash of impact, but there was none. I pulled off the road at a clear cut to see if there was anymore activity, but there was none.  I have seen numerous shooting stars, fireballs, comets, satelites ,the re-entry of space juck and other aerial displays, but this fit none of them. It was very strange to me and I spend alot of time looking at the skies for astronomical events.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I have never seen this before and it is hard to describe something to others without comparing it to familiar things. I have very little to compare it to except science fiction and special effects that have been in popular movies.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I live Vernon facing west. My view has a ridge of hills about 900 to 1200 ft on either side. In the centre is the airport and moving west further is a small inlet leading to Okanagan Lake. On the other side of Okanagan lake are mountains.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The current events are taking place on the north ridge of the airport in the western direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Monday  Tonight at 8:10 pm a &#34;star&#34; rose vertically over the ridge. The &#34;star&#34; was a bright white and golden light surrounded by a bubble (aura) reflecting the inner swirling colors, of green, blue, orange and pink. This light moved vertically to about an angle of 30 degrees in the sky. It moved horizontally south to hover over the down slope of the hill.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Inside of the bubble the &#34;light&#34; expanded to a large spinning ball of flame orange color. It then changed into what appeared to resemble a vehicle with two headlights, changed back to the ball and then to the vehicle. After the changes the bubble disappeared. The size of the bubble is of a pencil eraser held at arms length and the distance from me is about 7 k.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This happened in the time it takes to blink three times. The two large headlights had one green flashing light on one side and two flashing red lights on the other suggesting a shape of a vehicle. I do not get enough time to get a shape of the body but it does not reflect any light as does the body of an airplane. The vehicle hovered then the headlights turned away from me and headed south slower than an airplane can fly at landing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Wednesday  Tonight at 6:30 pm in the same area as the other sighting a large cloud lit up like a patio lantern with white light. The two lights appeared coming out of the cloud near the top of the cloud. The headlights moved slowly over the same area as the other and then the lights were switched off. The lights were switched on and the vehicle turned south. As I watched the flashing red lights head south, the flashers were switched off.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thursday  Tonight at 6:30 pm, two headlights crested the hill. Tonight it was different as the &#34;vehicle&#34; seemed to be outlined in a webbing of strung golden yellow lights reminding me of Christmas lights. There was still no detail of the vehicle but it was covered in this netting effect. It rose to about 40 degrees in the sky, moved south into the valley and stopped. The golden glow dimmed and three large circular lights in triangular formation came on underneath the vehicle. I watched it slowly head south and could see it until it dissappeared over the top of the hill and highway 97 to Kelowna. It was followed by alot of flashing red and green lights,suggesting something huge or several of the smaller ones described above.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thank you to the witness for the report.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Brian Vike, Director HBCC UFO Research Phone 1 250 845 2189 email: hbccufo@telus.net Website: http://www.hbccufo.com<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We express our gratitude to Brian Vike for submitting this report.

It happened very fast, and it was even luminous against the very bright bridge lights. It was unmistakable. No one in the area semeed to have seen it, so I forgot about it. That was until I saw that others in NY had seen it too. I think it may have been shooting towards Fort Wadsworth, where there has been UFO sightings before. I feel that whole area under Fort Wadsworth is hollow, going back to the 1700&#39;s; and DoD, Army, Coast Guard etc all have bases there. I think these orbs are energy fields, enabling these crafts to cheat normal physics. I wanted others to know what they saw was real.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Say the area of sky is the size of my computer screen and imagine the thing to be the size of a dime. Seeing it in the sky it appeared the size of a melon...but who knows because how far away was it?

After we got home I called our friends who had gone to their car in another part of the lot. They didn&#39;t see it either.

There was lots of traffic going down Flatbush. It was approximately 7:30 p.m. Within sight range as I walked, I saw a glowing whitish neon-green orb shoot through the sky, going south west, faintly lighting up the night. I stopped in my tracks. It moved as fast as a shooting star, straight on the horizon, about 30,000 ft. up (perhaps more or perhaps less; difficult to gauge). It was huge, the size of a tennis ball, perfectly spherical, and left a tail in its wake. It receded as it moved away from me in a straight line, then vanished into the darkness.

Also , according to me it was rather blue, a pale blue very luminescent, hazy on the edges, the size of the moon maybe? a bit bigger.It had the kind of move and<n> <n><n> way of disapearing as a shooting star, very fast.  It didn&#39;t seem to burn , though, and the speed of it was<n> <n><n> really astonishing.<n> <n><n> I cannot say which was the direction,but i remember I was looking at the left, and going down manhattan.

(I know this because right after the sighting, the car a little ways in front of me applied its brakes;  I thought they had seen it too, but it is more likely that they were slowing down to the 45 mph speed limit outside the town).  What I saw was a light green light fall from the sky in the north, slightly to the east.  At first I thought it must be a shooting/falling star, but it left no trail behind, like the shooting/falling stars that I have seen.  It also looked nothing like any aircraft I have seen in the night sky, and I have seen many and pocess a decent knowledge of aeronatics. It fell from approximately 75 degrees above the horizon to 55 degrees above the horizon, and then it disappeared just as it appeared.  I must note that either the object fell, or it flew across the sky, following the earths contour, much like a sattelite.  It looked almost as if it could be falling (if in fact it were) toward the Huntington Resoviour, which is located 5-10 miles north and slightly east of where I was when I had the sighting.  There is also an airport located right beside this resoviour, but I have never seen a beacon from the (or any other) airport that looked like this, nor as I have stated, an airplane.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When we visited the park by the dam that holds back the resivour 5 to 10 minutes later there were several flocks of geese (50 total geese perhaps)  in the run off (spillway) of the dam.  They seemed to be nervous and more vocal then normal.  Not only did it seem slightly odd to see geese in the middle of the Indiana winter, but also I have visited this park at least once a month for the past 6 months and have never seen geese there before.  My mind and imagination could have been running away with me on this issue of the geese, but I thought I would mention it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Besides the other witness who was with me, 2 other people witnessed something in the sky around Huntington, Indiana earlier that night.  One of them is a pilot.  Although I know all of the witnesses well, we decieded that we would not talk about our sightings until we reported them properly.  Hopefully they will post on here as well.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is my first reported sighting, although I may have had a sighting in grade school.  i do have an interest in the unexplained, although my strongly held religous views make this sighting disturbing.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

At 22:30, 13 Feb. 2004, I was in bed preparing for sleep when my wife, beside me, said, “There’s a bright light in the sky.” She was looking through our bedroom window out to sea to the southwest. I raised myself on one elbow and looking out, saw a reddish-yellow, unblinking light that appeared stationary in the sky at an elevation of about 30 degrees. Looking much like a streetlight at perhaps a mile or more distance, it was too big and much too bright to be a star though in colour and size we could have been persuaded that it was Mars at its brightest.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We continued to watch it and when it appeared to move in a retrograde, west to east direction then move higher in the sky, we decided to view it through binoculars. These had just been found and before I could train them on the light, the light suddenly went out.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Through the binoculars, where the object had just been, the sky was clear and the stars, which were bright that night, could be seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

My girlfriend and I were sitting on my bed in my dorm room watching a movie. I took a glance out of the window and saw a strange star. I told my girlfriend to look at it and she said, I know I&#39;ve been looking at it too. We studied it for a while and ruled out that it was not a star or a plane or a satellite. We were only able to look at the object through binoculars, but it was still very clear that this was no known object. The object was blinking red, white, and, blue. It looked orange at times possibly because it was blinking, or moving, extremely fast. After about a half hour of studying the object, it began to move upwards towards the right. It was moving quite fast because within an hour of wathing the object it was no longer visible. My girlfriend and I pondered on the sititng for a long time. On 02/16/04 when I returned to my girlfriend returned to my college to visit me for a few days we saw the object for a second time. It was noticed around the same time, about 10:00pm, in the same spot. It also began to move upwards towards the right until it was out of sight, again. My girlfriend asked me if I had seen it at all since the last time we saw it and I told her no because I hadn&#39;t. Also, the object did not follow the pattern of the orbit of the earth.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Possibly the star, &#34;Sirius?&#34;  PD))<n>

Through my windshield while fueling I noticed an extremely bright, gold &#34;star&#34; at about 45 degrees to the slight northwest. I exclaimed &#34;Hello...&#34; and before I could point it out to my boys, it winked out. I am aware that the area to the north and west is the Barry Goldwater Air Force Range, so I attributed it to that. We then began on our way to Tucson east on AZ rt 86 through the Tohono O&#39;Odahm reservation. About 10 miles down the road from Why, my oldest son, riding in the passenger seat, excitedly exclaimed that he saw it, as did my youngest from the back seat. As I turned to look up and out the front right (south), I also caught just a glimpse before it again disappeared. This was a crystal clear desert night, so it was not obscured by clouds, nor was it by the mountains as it was again at about 45 degrees. They asked me if it was a ufo. I said yes, as it certainly was flying and unidentified, either ours or &#34;Theirs&#34;. To tickle their fancy, you know.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It gets better. A moment later, there now appeared four bright gold &#34;stars&#34; on a 45 degree diagonal, top right, bottom left, and equally spaced, at the same position. The angle of my view made it difficult for me to see them without leaning forward. I was now rather nervous and wished only to get back to the city lights, so I continued without stopping. My son then informed me that the objects began to &#34;wink out&#34; one by one. This action repeated itself two more times, with me viewing only sporadicly. This was diificult at seventy mph if I wished not to drive off the road! We were all a little &#34;creeped&#34; by this, and it was only when I was satisfied that this would be only an encounter of the &#34;first kind&#34;, that I stopped, as planned, to view the magnificent milky way and star field indigenous to the area, as we are from the brightly lit mid- Atlantic region...<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We believe that stars, or other celestial bodies, would have to be ruled out, before we could conclude that the witnesses observed anything truly anomalous.

We were about one-half mile from home and traveling North about 30 mph when we both noticed two large white lights slightly above the treetops near the right side(East)of the road. My wife asked me what it was. My first thought was that they were the landing lights of an airplane which had just taken off from a nearby airport. I slowed down our car and rolled down the window,but we could hear no sound of an airplane. My wife glanced at the dashboard to see if the lights were affecting the electrical system of the car and they weren&#39;t,but she noticed the time was 7:11 pm. As we drove along slowly we noticed that the lights were only about 150 feet away from our car. Then I saw a dimmer red flashing light between the large lights which appeared to be about two feet in diameter and about ten feet apart. The white lights suddenly turned bluish white and seemed to grow in size and radiate from the object and at that instant I felt overcome by the early stages of sleep paralysis. I immediately floored the gas pedal and as we got away from the lights the sleep paralysis subsided. The experience lasted about 15 seconds. When we got home we wrote down separately what we had just seen and then compared notes. My wife said the lights were stationary thoughout the experience hovering above the treetops. She did not notice any change in color of the lights,but that there was white light projected from the two large lights and lit up the treetops brightly. She saw red lights between the two large white light,but did not see them flash. My wife described feeling as beening possessed or under hypnosis during the experience. There didn&#39;t seem to be any missing time as it was 7:20 pm when we were writing our notes of the experience. The skies were clear.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The description of the object is theirs: the object produced no vapor trail or other visible changing characteristic, and seemed almost stationary in the sky, but was shiny, and reflected the sunlight at times very strongly. The view of the object persisted for about 5 minutes during the drive until the object was obscured by low, tree lined hills. When our vehicle entered another area on the same highway, no object or aircraft was visible. Our direction on the highway, would have probably been toward the West or Northwest, as I could see the sun out my driver window, but not in my front window; the object would have been hovering or moving over a wooded area with only secondary roads, between any large towns or cities. I saw no sundogs or persistant natural aerial phenomena to explain this siting. I questioned my wife at length about an aircraft, but she was insistant that was she saw was spherical and not a conventional craft. My daughter,who was sitting behind my wife in our vehicle at the time, saw the same object and described the same shape. I have no reason to believe either of them would lie to me about the event, and nothing in our conversations on the drive home were even remotely concerned with unknown aeriel objects. Again, the object was sited from Highway 421(a four lane highway), near Yadkin County, North Carolina between 4 and 4:30 p.m. on 2/13/2004.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

On the corner of 55th and Genesee there is a lookout that looks toward Vashon Island. My father lives just below the KOMO radio towers, on Vashon, on the beach at Glen Acres. On this particular morning I noticed what appeared to be a bright fire on the beach near the location of his home. It was large enough that, from this distance, it looked to encompass an entire block of houses. I watched it for about 20 seconds before I continued through the turn to the East. It was still there as I cleared the next block and didn&#39;t disappear until I reached the next viewable location to the East. It was obvious, from the level of illumination, that the people who lived on the beach near Glen Acres had to have been awakened by the light. It was brilliant orange / yellow and the sun was still at a low elevation.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On Saturday, February 14th, I decided to call my father to determine if he had seen anything. To my surprise he was already excited with information that he was trying to relate along the same line.  This conversation occured at approximately 11:20 am.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What he described was an unusual zig-zag contrail that traveled from above his house to a location near Snoqualmie Pass.  He was quite enthralled with the unique nature of the contrail as it didn&#39;t resemble anything he has seen in the past.  This was observed at or near sun-up on the morning of February 14th above Vashon Island&#39;s East side.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The object moved in a straight path, the lights never dimming, and quite low in the sky visible through the trees. I felt the object moved much faster and lower than an airplane.

Its altitude from the horizon was about 10° in the constellation of Centaurus.We pointed the 10&#34; telescope and it appeared just as any other normal cloud  would appear.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 03:20 am The object was over the star &amp;#952; Cen. To the naked eye the effect was as good as a cloud blocking a star but somewhat more pronounced - the light scattering was more. It was like the moon was blocked by clouds. Through the telescope however we saw asymmetrical gradation of white light. At this point we were sure that it was a cloud so we stopped following it. After sometime this so called cloud disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 03:35 am The cloud became visible again and this time was more bright. At this point it was about 20° - 25° above the southern horizon. We got curious. One of our members pointed the telescope at it and was surprised to see a fast rotating spiral. At 50X magnification in a 25mm plossl, the spiral structured covered about 3/4 the field and showed about 5 loops. Check out image 1. We calculated the velocity - drift of the object using the eyepiece field &amp; found it to be 0.64°/min. It was very fast. The rotation period of the loop was about 13 seconds. We boosted the magnification to 125X. The object showed another small bright point light source to the top right of its centre.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 04:05 am The object was appearing to slow down. The loops had increased to 9. We again calculated the drift speed &amp; found it to be 0.2°/min. The secondary small source of light had gradually increased in size and separation w.r.t. the spiral center, now it was very bright &amp; easily visible at 50X than it was visible half hour back at 125X.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 04:10 am We pointed out our SLR cameras in the direction of the object which was now faint, hoping we would at-least record the trail.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 04:15 am The object was loosing naked eye visibility. It was now difficult to the naked eye. However we were tracking it in the telescope.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 04:35 am We just took off the telescope to continue our hunt for the remaining galaxies in Virgo (we had seen 23 galaxies already that day) After sometime when we tried to spot the object again, we never found it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((CORRESPONDENCE WITH WITNESS))<n> <n><n> <n><n> Dear Mr. ((name deleted)),<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thank you very much for sharing the interesting information with our Center!<n> <n><n> <n><n> Have you determined what the object was that you observed that night??

They would appear coming from different places in the sky and move in different directions, sometimes at about the speed of an airplane but then moving suddenly at incredible speed in different directions. I managed to catch a couple of them with my binoculars but that did not improve the detail.  There were patches of clouds which obscurred our vision at times but we had a good view from a balcony overlooking the Caribbean from our condominium. The UFO&#39;s were almost as bright as a star and seemed to be very high but their speed at times made you think they were a lot closer as they could move acoss the sky in a few seconds at their highest speed.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The lights were all a very bright white and they were flashing and strobing. The light would start on the bottom and was strobbing and getting progressively brighter as it went up. Then it would repeat this. It made no noise. It looked like a floating rectangle. We watched it strob and flash as it flew off to the east horizon.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was floating there by itself with no stars around it. The reason my dad and I noticed this was because compared to all the other stars, it was unbelievably bright. It was so bright that it was quite hard to look at. If it were a plane, it would&#39;ve been moving and less bright. This &#39;thing&#39; however, didnt move at all for about 3 hours... It just floated there. Occasionally you would be able to see a red light moving towards it from different directions. One time the red light came up from the bottom right hand corner of the light. As it neared the light, it faded away. A few minutes later, i saw with my binoculars, the red light moving in from the top left hand corner of the light. I zoomed in on the light with my binoculars and i saw that the light was made up of two round lights. One right above the other and slightly to the right. the top one was red-ish orange and the bottom was a very light green-ish white light. these two together shone like the brightest light in the sky. It was amazing. Every once in a while i&#39;d see the red light again. and the bright (two) lights would just float there and not move an inch. When i looked at it through binoculars i thought i just saw two lights.. the most &#39;shape&#39; i saw out of it would have to be a circle... if i had better binoculars, i may have been able to see more. I wonder if it was a UFO because it didnt move.. i watched it for a while and it seemed to be getting lighter and lighter as the time passed. eventually i stopped looking at it and only glanced at it every few minutes. it got lighter and lighter.. one minute it wuz still a pretty bright light compared to the others.. and then next second it had disappeared... The way it shone.. i cant forget. it was like the middle of it shone the brightest and around it it shone like crazy too. it was soo bright around and the light itself. nothing could&#39;ve been shining like that.. nothing normal anyway..<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous.

This happened in complete daylight with clear visabilty about 10 miles from LAX. I was born and raised in this area and I&#39;m very familiar with aircraft, helocopters and small aircraft landing or flying near LAX. The very fast movement across the sky behind the airplanes which I had been observing all morning is what caught my attention in the first place.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was observerving contract linemen install an 80 foot power pole near an energized line for the power company that I work for. It was my job to shout out constant reminders of thier proximty to the energized lines on which they were working on.I was aware of thier presence the whole time, aproximately 10 hours. This practice is very common among electric workers and is a very useful and traditional way of keeping linemen safe and aware of danger. I had to keep my glance on them constantly because they were working adjacent to a &#34;hot&#34; line.Off in the distance while observing the linemen,is when I saw a white &#34;star&#34; moving across the sky in a pattern that reminded me of an insect. Not a straight line... but very erractic,  like a fly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I called one of the groundmen (person who assits the linemen from the ground) over to verify what I have been observing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was one &#34;star&#34; streaking across the cloudless sky.It joined a formation of other &#34;stars&#34; 5, when they circled, hovered motionlessly about a minute, then went straight up. We obseved one of these objects &#34;turn off&#34; and then on and restore itself to it&#39;s original brilliance,until we could no longer see them.We observed one object breakaway and go due north and up before we could no longer see it.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I then became curious by the more circular shape of the object (a ball shape)&amp; at that time I noticed the absence of wings &amp; the clear definition of a round shape .  The object suddenly changed speed (Faster) then appeared to stop in mid air. It slowly moved back north for about 2 or 3 seconds then south again. It was a beautiful sunny morning with clear blue sky. The object stayed suspended in the sky for 10 - 15 seconds then either turned or changed its shape into a cylinder type tube. The sun was reflecting more of its surface as the object appeared to turn. It was definately a metalic surface as it reflected the sun brightly, but its darker form was also visible as if it were illuminated from another light source (A darker metallic grey). It was at this time that the object accelerated out of sight heading due east. The speed at which the object dissapeared was astounding!  I was later told by a friend that he was on the telephone with his wife when she observed the same object at the same time, about 0915am, also in Port Angeles.

After a few minutes i saw a white light appear beside the star, it began to fall twards the earth.  I thought this was kind of strange, but i continued to watch it fall, not wishing to record the event(pictures/movie ect.).  I thought of it as a meterorite or somthing, and relitivly cool to watch.  The object had then been falling for about a minute, when it began to change.  It started turning red, darker and darker and getting larger and larger.  At this point i thought it was going to explode because of the heat from entering the atmosphere, this happened for about 30 seconds, at which point i noticed that this was mot a meterorite, because it was leaving no trail.  I wanted 2 grab my camera but was enthraled to stay and watch, just to see if I was wrong.  At this point it turned white again, I knew then I had to grab my camera.  I watched for a few more seconds and it began to flash bright red, becoming about 15 times the size every time it did so.  I went and grabed my camcorder, turned it on, no tape, ran back and grabbed a tape, switched the tape and hit record.  I could not see anything through my camera, so I ran outside and turned on the nightshot.  The street light  was blocking my nightshot workage.  I soon figured out if I placed my hand to the side of the camera the light wouldn&#39;t hit the lens.  All this took about 2 minutes to take place.  At this time the light was moving horizontally across the sky as opposed to vertically.  I filmed it with some shakey hand work, I then saw a commercial airliner, I decided to film that so there would be some refferance as to what airoplanes looked like on my camera, when I looked back at the object it had dropped down again and was now flying horizontally behind some trees.  I got a few seconds of that and when it disappeared i turned off the camera and watched to se! e if it returned.  It didn&#39;t, but it left me with some great footage, and an even better story.  And once I get this program on my computer working so I can capture my film I&#39;ll send it in.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

At first there were 3 lights with rays of light above and below. Then 2 sets of 3 smaller lights appeared between the 3 lights. It began vertical and depending where you stood it was horizontal or at varing degrees turned. There were up to 21 lights. I called the police and an officer witnessed this as well. He called in a helicoppter and when it was headed in the direction of the lights they disappeared only to return within 5 minutes. We saw them in the same location from night fall until 8pm so for 3 other nights and then we returned from our vacation.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I noticed over to my right @ apprx. a 45 degree angle and upwards to the sky @ apprx. a 30 degree angle a moderatly orange with a slight hint of red ball with a very weak whithish haze. At first sight there was only one, then with a few seconds there was a second one that floated as though it was exactly behind the first one or came out from within, and then a third doing exactly the same but came from the second one, #2 &amp; #3 moved towards the left, or NW. They appeared to be at lest 50 miles off in the sky. The sky was mostly crisp and clear with a few very dark heavy clouds, but not close to the area of the objects. There also were a few planes in the sky being very easy to determine as such because of there markers flashing and steady pace of speed &amp; direction. Then after all three sat motionless for appx. 1 min. the #3 object moved @ a very fast but graceful speed over towards due north apprx. 30 yards in the distant horizone. At that point they all sat still for apprx. only 15 sec. then disappeared instantly without any trace. At that point as I sat amazed for apprx. 2 min. and still looking in the same area one appeared again in almost the exact location as the first one but slightly left, the repeated the sequence minus the third object appearing and/or great movement. At last sight I was still gazing but had exited my vechile and walked toward the direction about 20 feet and stood looking for apprx. 5-6 min. and the once again one appeared but closer at an appeance of apprx. 25 miles off in the sky but more right and higher. It appeared for only about 30 sec. motionless then once again totaly vanished.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness to alleged event elects to remain totally anonymous.  PD))<n>

He resides in Red Rock British Columbia and is an amateur astronomer. He mentioned that he lives a very organized life and keeps track of the things that take place around him. On the evening of February 11, 2004 at 7:00 p.m. he was out in his yard feeding the dogs and socializing with them for a while and at 7:27 p.m. he looked up into the sky, it was clear and beautiful to look at he said.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Seeing Orion to the south of him and almost due northeast he saw a star that started to grow brighter and brighter and it out shone Venus several times over. As the fellow watched it finally just faded away into nothing. The witness said it did not move. As mentioned above, he first thought it was a star, but there was no flickering to it and the color was a steady bright white.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The gentleman thought it rather strange, as he spends every chance he gets outside viewing the night sky through his telescope. He said he has seen nothing like this before. The witness also said he knows what a satellite, star, planet, etc is, what it was the man saw was no star, at least in his mind. The fellow said he stood speechless there for a while after witnessing this strange event. The man called a close friend who resides in Prince George who also belongs to an astronomy club. His friend had no idea and suggested he contact me, which he did.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I enjoyed chatting with the fellow as he was telling me that the club is pouring a cement pad for a large telescope they are putting in when the weather warms again. Also he has invited me down for a visit when everything is up and running. I am certainly going to take the trip to visit.

I happened to look up at the moon and noticed, what at first, looked like two planets (one over the other). I recall thinking how unusual this would be without any pomp and circumstance in the news. They appeared to be planet-like instead of stars because their light was steady - not winking. I just couldn&#39;t believe the closeness of these two celestial bodies.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They were below the half-moon by about a hand width at anns length and very bright - similar to Venus and Jupiter. It was too high above the horizon to be Venus (approximate location of the sun at high noon), but there wasn&#39;t any other explanation in my opinion. The objects weren&#39;t moving - they were stationary. While standing there frozen in my gaze, the top one began fading in strength much like a variable star but happening so fast it couldn&#39;t have been.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I thought perhaps it might be a cloud or mist rolling across my view of this planet like object, but when I checked the sky, there wasn&#39;t a cloud or mist of any kind whatsoever. The stars and the moon were crystal clear and there was a faint star just below the moon that remained the same brightness throughout my observation.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Within less than 20 seconds the light from the first object had disappeared completely. I was flabbergasted.  And then shortly afterward the second source began fading until within a short period of time, it too was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It couldn&#39;t have been two stationary satellites reflecting the rising sun, because the sun would be shining on them (rising within the hour) - not setting on them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> (NOTE: This note is not for publication - I have included my work phone - not home phone number.)<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Possible sighting of planets??

At first i thought it was a plane, Cause well were talking about a UFO here. So, i look out and it has a orange shade/glow. It was oval/plate shapped. The other witnesses told me before it came it was seriously really close to them. When i went it was about 4-5 miles away from me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Little by little it started to fade, Than when it did i kept staring at its location it had disappered. When it moved from one location to another in a quick flash. Leaving a lightening type fade from its movement it kept doing this for about 5 more minutes when it finally dispeared.

I noticed that the red light started to dim a little bit, and then get bright agian.  this light was brighter than anything else in the sky! i knew it wasn&#39;t a plane because there were no blinking blue lights.  then it moved up slightly and a little piece of it seemed to &#34;break off&#34; and fall down and then faded away...soon after the light too faded away...this is by far the most bizzare thing i&#39;ve ever seen in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

As we got closer, i noticed that it was changing between red, blue, orange, yellow, and green colors, almost as if the colors were moving around it.  We went back to my friends house which was only a few blocks away(we were at the outskirts of town) and got a pair of binoculars, i told him to hurry for fear of the object leaving.  After we got the binoculars, we drove back to our spot and i turned off my car.  My friend had trouble finding the object, so I took the binoculars and watched the object through the binoculars.  As i did, I could see the object clearly.  It was fluctuating like before, but as i watched it started to fade out.  Then it came back, the colors more intense, and it started blinking.  It did this one more time and then moved slowly across the sky, eventualy disapearing under the horizon.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was flying from the NW to the SE.  I was moving extremely slowly and began to obscure a large portion of the night sky.  When it came more fully into view it appeared to be the size of 2 to several football fields.  There were lights along the sides of the object on the underneath side.  Or at least that  is how it appeared. I was viewing it from the ground to its underneath side.  It moved so slowly that it was eerie.  Also, it was so quiet that it seemed to consume all sound as it progressed in its path.  I immediately went into my home and called my son out to see it.  By the time I got back outside and my son joined me (just seconds), two identical objects came into view.  They were flanking the lead object - or grouping of lights - to its port and aft positions and a little behind it. The pr! ecision of the formation was remarkable. The night was clear, and the sky was full of stars.  The 3 objects almost completely filled the sky in a 45 degree vertical sightline and a 180 degree horizontal sightline.  They were huge and completely silent.  For the next 2 - 4 minutes, my son and I watched as they continued flying over the horizon of surrounding homes.  They continued to proceed at the same height and speed until they were out of our sight.  However, as they were almost out of sight, my son recalls that the sides of the objects appeared to undulate, in a similar manner as a bird flapping its wings a little.  They appeared to be flying so low that I could imagine being able to reach them by firing a rifle, if I shot up vertically when they flew over.  The stars were obscured as they flew over us,  and the stars could be seen again as the objects passed.  I did not report this before, as I did not know to whom to report it, did not know if anyone would care, and wa! s afraid of ridicule. I am reporting it now because I saw a show that featured the Phoenix, AZ, lights.  The descriptions of the Phoenix Lights were very close to that which my son and I observed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date is approximate.  PD))<n>

While we were getting in the car, I looked up at the stars as the night was clear. I then realised that what looked like a star was actually moving. It looked like a star, but was slightly yellowish in colour. There were no flashing lights &amp; the altitude was far too high for it to be a visible air bus. I would say it was over 100,000 feet high (though I know it&#39;s hard to tell) The object moved from West to East (ish). I pointed it out to my partner, who agreed that it was strange. The object then disappeared for a few seconds, only to re-appear what would have been a number of miles away on a similar heading. It then disappeared again after we observed it for another 20 seconds or so. The sky was very clear &amp; the stars were all visible, so cloud cover was at the least minimal. That&#39;s about it really, but I&#39;d like to know if anyone else saw anything. The time I have given must be pretty close to the actual time, maybe a few minutes out.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

After the spheres vanished I saw several blinking  lighs in the sky that looked like airplanes then I heard very loud booms in the sky, like a sonic boom.  I later spoke to the owner of Champion springs ranch and she told me she saw the sphere&#39;s as well and that she had saw them on other occasions.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

This is very common since i live right under a flight pattern. I continued to watch it while conversing with my wife and noticed the second light hadn&#39;t deviated from its position, nor did it have the usual blinking lights we see on aircraft. I continued to watch it as 3 more aircraft past the point and moved by and i asked my wife to observe it. We continued to watch it and it did not move. I figured it was likely a planet so i wanted to check it out with my binoculars. I had my wife continue to watch it while i went and retrieved the binoculars. I returned and focused on the object and when i first focused it i saw what appeared to by a pattern of lights like this &#34;.....&#34;, i then gave my wife the binoculars and she observed it for a while. She stated that is looked like a star. My mother had just came over and she commented that it was the &#34;North star&#34;. i continued to observe it further, this time it was spherical, distant and not moving. At this point i wrote it off as a planet and went back in side. about a minute later i grabbed some garbage and went out to the trash. Again i looked up and this time there was absolutely nothing in the sky. My conclusion is there would be no way that a star or other planetary body could move across the horizon that fast. It was the brightest object i could see in the sky at the time and observing it with and without the binoculars i saw no movement whatsoever, nor any additional lights after the first observance.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I could not see what the lights were attached to. I would guess the craft was about 200 yards wide from my vantagepoint.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The 6 orbs seemed to rotate through colors from left to right, shimmering.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They remained in formation, stationary, and (one to another) for 5min. 13sec.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Until they vanished out of sight, as quickly as they had appeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The lights never changed their position in the sky, to each other or the area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have taken thousands of photos, with the same camera, from the same hill, for over 5 years, and have never seen anything like it before. I have lived in North County more than 31 years and have never seen Camp Pendleton (Marine Corps Base) produce any similar visual displays while commencing military exercises. I also grew up next to Oceanside Airport, in addition to spending many hours at Miramar Top Gun School watching all the various types of planes. So I know what different craft look like in the night sky. In my opinion, these 6 lights are not ours!<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We have looked at the several photographs, provided by the witness, and they show 5-6 unidentifiable lights, oriented horizontally.  We do not know what the lights are, although we believe that military flares may be a possibility.  However, the witness indicates that he thinks that flares are not a possibility, since the lights remained stationary, and they didn&#39;t exhibit any smoke.  PD))<n>

The larger one appeared first followed by a smaller one to the right (or East) of the larger one. As quick as they appeared they disappeared. Then a few seconds later three more orange fireballs appeared and they were in a perfect straight line parallel to the ground and appeared lower in the horizon than the first two. A second later another smaller orange fireball appeared to the left (or West) of the three lined up in formation. Again, they disappeared very quickly. The objects appeared and disappeared in the same location. They never travelled at all in the sky. I have never seen anything quite like it.<n>

Proceeded beyond the stop at Toby Pike heading west and looked up in the sky at the angles reported above.  The sighting appeared spontaneously - a bright glittering light to the right side of the road came on.  It was a type of blinking effervescence – bright white and blinking gold – a similar set of lights – looking to be about 2 inches apart from my location - come on just to the right of it, horizontally – shinning in the same pattern.  Then the second set of lights shut off – does dim quickly – and the original light dims in the same way and then disappear – total duration 5 seconds or so.  Somewhat disbelieving my eyes I scan the sky I see the exact same pattern occur to the left of the road this time and parallel to the first sighting – same pattern and same duration.  I slowed down and clearly saw other types of stars, clear sky, and bright planet, jet lights but all paled by light brightness and size comparisons.  I saw it again after a 10 second interval, the same set of lights appear a third time on the right side of the road again in what appeared to be in the same spot as the first sighting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Not knowing what I was seeing I turned left and headed south toward State Rd 18 and looked at my watch that read 7:40 PM. That means that all had transpired in 5 to 10 minutes.  I turned west onto State Rd 18 traveling towards Sweetser – I picked up my cell phone to call my husband and was unable to complete the call due to severe static that was atypical to the usual connections in this area.   At this time of year the sky at this time would be dark and star filled and I had no more sighting that evening.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The sighting was unusual enough that I discussed it with my family and searched the web for similar experiences.  I did not report to local law enforcement at that time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Two days later at approximately the same time, 7:44 PM my husband and I were in separate cars following each other heading west on State Rd 22 just west of State Rd 37 south of Marion, IN.  The same pattern of appearing and disappearing lights reoccurred three times, both of us saw the sightings from the different cars.  I tried to call my husband’s cell phone to see if he was seeing the same sight but my cell phone would not ring through even though the display showed it was ringing. He later stated that the his cell phone never rang.   We checked his phone later – it was on and in reception mode and showed no recent call from me.  Later both phones were working fine as we reached home.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The pattern of the lights this time occurred to the left of the road then moved to the right of the road and back to the left of the road at about the same height from the horizon and off the road to the same angle as the first sighing.  This appeared to almost be a reversal of the first sighting on Feb 9 that was right then left then right.  The only difference was that the lights did not appear to glitter as much as the first time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then as I turned of State Road 13 heading north toward Swayzee, IN my eye caught movement of a low flying plane over Swayzee and noticed, in the western sky, 90 degrees to my left, the pattern of lights appearing once again and the companion set of lights with all disappearing in the same way.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After getting home we checked the web for other sightings and noticed similar occurrences have been documented on –1/14/2003 by a person located in Peru, IN traveling West toward Kokomo which was the same direction we had been traveling each time.  Another report was 11/15/2000 – Kokomo at 8:00 PM.  A third report was found on 10/15/1998 – location Dublin, IN (south of).<n> <n><n> <n><n>

At first we thought it was a boat, but the light got closer and brighter, moving very fast in the air. Then it stopped level with our deck, about 1/2 mile out over the ocean and five bright amber lights began flashing in a random sequence. This display lasted about 10-15 seconds then went dark. We went back in the house thinking it was over, then about 5 minutes later spotted it again over the ocean coming closer towards us. As we were trying to follow the lights, they disappeared again and went dark. Then we looked up and there were 3 large amber lights about 30-40 ft. up from our deck. The object was there about 30-45 seconds hovering in the air and from the spacing of the lights, we estimate it was about the width of our house. The lights were almost rectanglar with rounded edges and about 4 ft. wide each. My husband climbed up on the roof to get a closer look and the lights went dark again. There was no sound, or was so quiet it was masked by the sound of the surf.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We returned to the house, found the camera this time and waited again in case it returned. About 5 minutes later we spotted it out over the ocean again about 3 miles out going south. It had numerous amber/white lights displayed around the bottom in a circle and a red pulsating light above and then a white, more diffused light above that. It looked like a three story crown floating out over the water almost to the horizon. We watched it travel very slowly for about 45 minutes with zoom binoculars but were unable to get a good picture as it was so far away by then. It continued it&#39;s slow course, went behind a boat which was lit up brightly and then went into a fog bank. The last sighting was at 8:10 pm pacific time.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

There, Highway 4 is two-lane, and twisty. It has an upward grade on the West side and a valley to the East and the road goes slightly to the NnE.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Because Highway 4 is winding and visibility is low at this point, I was driving slowly (40mph or less) when I saw a small ball of Blue-white light to the west side of the road, apparantly coming towards me. The west (left) side has a grade that goes up steeply, and whatever it was would either have to go up the hill or onto the road.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I slowed further and pulled to the centre of the road. At first I thought it was someone on a snomobile outing, but it was the twilight of day and I saw no snomobile, but just the light. The ball of light, as it turned up to be, came onto the roadway from the west side, and rolled in a SsE direction. It rolled over the Northewst (front driver) corner of my car and across the hood. It did not burn the paint or make sparks off of the car. The ball rolled up the hood and spread out over the windshield. My radio ariel is inside of the windsheild as wires in the glass so there were no sparks from it, either. As the ball passed over the center rear of the hood the engine died cold, although the car continued to roll of its own momentum. The dashboard lamps and headlamps went out, and the radio went off. The ball passed over the roof of the car and rolled down the back window, and across the trunk and off of the southeast (rear passanger) corner of the car. I can&#39;t be sure I heard it make a sound, if it made a sound it was like a plastic grocery bag rattling if you crumpled it up. I looked in my mirror and saw as it rolled southward a short distance (30-40 feet)down the center of the road and rolled off the East (right) side of the road into the valley below, where I lost sight of it. I turned my key off and turned it back on, and as the car was still rolling and in gear the motor started up, although the headlamps and dash lamps were dim for a few miles. By the time I had reached Estherville (Ten Miles North) the headlamps and dashboard lamps were brighter, and I continued on to Spirit Lake via Highway 9. By the time I reached Spirit Lake (about 20 miles West) all of the lamps and the like seemed to work, but my presets on the radio had to be reset, and the clock was wrong.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The ball of light left no marks on my car&#39;s paint or the vinyl roof, and as my car is old enough not to have a computer in it (1978) there seem to be no lasting effects. I was physically unharmed, except that I had &#34;flash bulb syndrome&#34; (a ghost of the light was showing up as an after effect) for ten miles or so, and some metal fillings in my teeth hurt for a few days.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I called him on his cell phone to ask him a question, when he answered he asked me to look at all those strange lights on left. I thought they were towers, like cell phone towers or something. If you use the lights as a guide to the top of the tower. They were all uneven and very bright. They were not blinking and they way lower then planes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The lights did not move at all. They just sat there. I insisted they were towers. He told me they weren&#39;t. 15 to 20 minutes later, he went back by the spot and the lights were gone.

When this object went out of visual and futher away, the dog barking completly stopped! As for the shape of the object, I really could not make out a form except a circuler light moving in a stright line. I am quite familier with all aircraft frames. I was in the Airforce for 23 years as a fuels logistics quality assurance specilist. This was not the normal aircraft frame! All aircraft make turbo noise after they fly over.

It was small and hard to determine the altidude. It seemed to drift slowly to the south then to the south east. The object appeared to be small and round. It seemed to wobble or spin. It flashed a firey red light at an irregular interval. Sometimes the light was quick and dim. Other times it seemed to flare up. As it slowly drifted over the building I lost sight of it an so left my office to go downstairs to see if I could catch it on the other side of the building. When I came outside and looked around it was gone. However at the same time I looked south and saw a single military aircraft moving untypically fast from the direction of Ellington Field an moving WNW. It seemed to be 3-5 miles to the south. The plane then went west and I think did a U-turn back toward the east. I would note however that President Bush is in town tonight for a fund raiser. That&#39;s it. I don&#39;t know what it was. It was NOT a plane or helicopter. It seems like it could possibly heve been a baloon of some kind but the flashing was wierd - unless it has an irregular surface that was &#34;spinning&#34; and possibly reflecting light from the sunset in the west. Plausible - but I just can&#39;t say. It was certainly unusual enough to get and hold my attention. I took 3 digital photos but they don&#39;t show much more than a small reddish dot. I really wish I had a bigger zoom. Will email you the images that I have in seperate email<n>

We saw something not really sure of the shape. we were amazed because we have not seen anything falling from the sky with this stange greenish glow. There wasn&#39;t a sound it looked like it was falling in slow motion,toward the Alum Springs Park. The sky is clear and you can see the stars fine. What ever this was did not look like any shooting star i have ever seen. I hope we were not the only ones to have caught a glimpse of this.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It slowley moved down in the sky and then away from us till out of sight.  Looking through binoculars you could make out a cluster of shimmering lights, we think four.  We also watched this the night before.  I talked to Mr Davenport on the hotline.  The night before there was a cloud cover at 4,000ft.  This night it was clear.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The light was slightly to the west when I first noticed it. It looked like a bluish white large planet (I don&#39;t know anything about astronomy, I just like to look at the sky), but I noticed that it was moving to the east. It appeared to be quite high, and was moving quite a bit faster than a commercial aircraft, but definitely slower than a meteor. The light continued going east, and I watched it until it disappeared behind some trees in the distance (almost to the eastern horizon.) The light did not flash or flicker like an exhaust or reflected light, it seemed to be self-luminous. It did not leave a trail behind like a missile or meteor. I did not see any red or green navigation lights as it departed to the east, which I would have expected it it were an aircraft. It is unusual to see any air traffic going directly west to east from this location. Riverside is under the approach for LA and Orange County airports, and there were numerous jetliners in the sky at the same time, all going from east to west, or from NE to SW for Orange County. All had easily seen red and green navigation lights and strobing white lights in addition to their landing lights. The object was noticeably different that the jetliners in appearance. There were faint jet engine noise heard, but it was probably related to the commercial aircraft going overhead at the same time.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

2/6/04 22:50|Egham (UK/England)||Light|5minutes|light in the sky with peculiar movements|2/12/04|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/034/S34900.html|249|ndxe200402| Low &#34;hum&#34;, white lights change to red and appear to almost merge at one point...cigar-like shape.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I was leaving work, as I walked the approximately 150 feet to my car, I noticed in the sky several strong, white lights.  These &#34;lights&#34; passed almost directly over my head, at an approximate distance of about 500-700 feet.  It was the proximity of the &#34;lights&#34; that initially caught my eye, as airplanes do not usually fly so close.  -It should also be noted that I work in an area of our small city slightly away from the &#34;main&#34; town, and thusly it is usually relatively dark (except for some scattered facility lighting).  Also, it was a very clear night, except for some very distant (high) clouds, the night was clear and crisp.  Visability was excellent and without fog, etc.  The lights were travelling approx. north-east and, as mentioned, seemed to be brighter white than conventional aircraft---almost on a level par with aircraft landing lights.  Particularly strange to me was the fact that:  (1)  These (2) white lights were travelling one-behind-another (separated by a distance of approx. 4-fingers (held-out at arms-length).  -It struck me as too wide of a space for the lights to be on the same craft and yet too tight of a space for their to be two craft following one another.  (2)  The lights did not blink initially, but were steady and bright white.  (3)  Although I am not definitive about the exact shape of the craft, as it was a clear night and the craft passed almost overhead, I judged the shape to be a cigar or cylinder (without wings!!) by the black &#34;space&#34; that the craft made as it passed over me (i.e. lack of star light in one area).  I definately did not see any wings.  (4)  The lack of sound was unusual, as the craft passed relatively close overhead.  I did hear an almost cyclic &#34;hum&#34; though, but this was very low-pitched.  (5)  The SPEED of the craft was VERY slow.  The object almost seemed to be stationery at one point, although in retrospect I believe that it was travelling so slow away from me that it appeared at a standstill.  It was witnessed by myself for at least 5-! minutes, even as I headed home in my car I could see one of the two lights off in the distance.  -The &#34;leading&#34; light always appeared to be slightly brighter.  (6)  As I watched it overhead, it was very disconcerting because it almost felt as if it knew I was there (I know that sounds silly) because at that point the &#34;trailing&#34; light started to come towards the &#34;leading&#34; light as if if they were about to collide or merge.  My initial reaction was, &#34;Well, if they are airplanes or helicopters I am going to find out because they will crash!&#34;  These two lights came within less than 1-finger apart from one another and then spread out again to their original 4-finger distance.  It was at about that time that the &#34;leading&#34; light changed to RED and sometimes would blink...sometimes (not all the time---It was an irregular pattern).  The &#34;trailing&#34; light remained white.  Notably, we do have Vandenberg AFB approx. 18-miles from this location; however, the lights appeared to travel more towards Santa Maria than Lompoc and, again, moved VERY slowly.  I did not see any other aircraft (planes, etc.) in the sky, but did (as I headed home) see in my rear-vision mirror (in the light of the full or almost-full moon)see several white contrail lines.  FYI:  I am college-educated and in the medical field.  I am very curious to see how many people report this sighting, as it lasted so long and seemed so unusual.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  This witness is well known to us, and we consider her to be exceptionally reliable.  We suspect her sighting occurred precisely as she describes it above.  She is a medical professional.  PD))<n>

The 134 Freeway then turns into the 101 Freeway going north.  Once I was on the 101, I noticed the the craft was traveling at a very low speed (traffic below was moving at least 65mph) while the craft slowly moved east.  The four lights were very bright and the craft itself was black with no reflection to the solid (metal?) frame. As I came up to the side of the craft (my driver side), I noticed that the craft was in a trianular shape with a smaller triagular shape tail at it&#39;s end (like a whales fin - flat).  Once I passed the craft, from the back, you could barley see the it.  The lights that were bright from the front, where not visible from behind. Some how, the crafts metal frame was absorbing the light that it was giving off (four front lights were bright, but gave no reflection to the craft, unlike the lights on a car, once you get close enough, you can see the detail of the grill).<n> <n><n> <n><n> Last night a good friend of mine told me that he saw the same craft on Sunday, Feb. 8th at 8:00pm over the 90 Freeway (Marina Del Rey Freeway).<n> <n><n> <n><n> He gave me the same discript of craft and it&#39;s movement.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I saw a bright dot in the sky moving and blinking intermittenly. I was in the car and the angle of declination would have been at about 50 degrees ahead of me and at a distance of 1 mile approximately. The object was blinking white and out, moving at first what seemed to be a gliding/floating movement (like a balloon), only to continue moving linear, heading east towards the Atlantic ocean (only 5 miles east). My wife who was in the car with me, DID NOT SEE, this object, even when I pointed out a building it was over as a point of reference for spotting it. Then the object &#39;blipped&#39; and took off east and I saw no more of it after that.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was going to write this incident off as just another incident (I&#39;ve seen and reported objects before), until a friend of mine, 14 miles south and one half-hour later, reported to me the SAME EXACT INCIDENT. The same with 3 witnesses present and again, the one female present COULD NOT SEE THE OBJECT. We had a laugh about only the males being able to view the object, but then, this only adds to the anomaly and the fact that it was NOT a balloon or any material object that we ALL should have been able to witness.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thank you for letting me share this event.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

(film flaw or perhaps a bit of static electricity in a digital camera) Something that bright would show purple or violet on surrounding bushes etc. I would expect violet highlights on the white cat or the snow for example. I don&#39;t see them.  The other thing it might be is something on the branch that focuses the light like a prism there seems to be another bright spot just below the cat maybe the same color. but it seems to me to have happened after the image was captured.  With a digital camera in cold weather there is sometimes a static electric charge that makes interesting effects.<n> <n><n> so there are my thoughts<n> <n><n> Ray-Paul<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((END COMMENT))<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We express our gratitude to Ray-Paul Nielsen, Brier, WA, for supplying us with the opinion.

It seemed at first to be changing shape but then I realized it was just changing its orientation from side to 3/4 view, roughly maintaining its top and bottom orientation. I ran in to get my binoculars and it had moved westrard, slightly north. It remained fairly low in the sky and did not move quickly, but rather unsteady, as if it were being pushed along by the prevailing wind  current. I tried to think of any one being in the craft, but thought that if there was any one there they must be unconcious because it seemed to just wander in a general westward direction. It appeared to be a gold hub cap-like shape, with some radial pattern on the top, which would catch the sun and flash its gold highly reflective color. It continued in this lolling manner for 30 minutes. I half expected it to zoom out of sight all of a sudden, but it just gradully bobbed along heading more directly west and out of sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I thougt nothing of it at first and that it was just a plane. However when I focused on it, it was very strange. It appeared to be flying at a lower altitude than a commercial airplane would be flying and was completely silent and moving very quickly across the sky. It was three dim circles with no center ( white light) in a triangle formation appeared to be all one craft. It was much to quick and silent to be any plane as well as the lights were not of that that you would see on any regular aircraft. It definately was not a comet or any bird. It was very strange and interesting.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I saw a bright light in the sky to the west at 30 degrees above the horizon which appeared to be over Sagamore Hills which is about two miles from where I was standing in Northfield, Ohio, which was way too brilliant to be a star. When obtaining binoculars, I saw that it appeared to be a sherical shape which was made up of continually changing irregular squiggly lines, looking to be white on the southern most hemisphere, and lime green on the northern hemisphere. This brilliant object was sitting still for about 20 minutes, then slowly moved westward till out of sight at about 30 mph. I took pictures with a digital camera and they revealed a small &#34;horseshoe shaped object&#34; that was moving so fast it created the image that it was a sphere, leaving tracers. I looked around the sky and saw a similar object which was blue and white and had blue lights flashing around the center of the sphere. The blue lights appeared as some light colored blue LED&#39;s moving around as a marquee would. This object was about 75 degrees above the horizon to the east and a little to the south. It hovered there for about the same time. I noticed about 6 or 8 of these object much higher in the sky, but were very similar except they were white and red looking spheres. They remained stationary as well.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Around the brightest one (the one I mentioned first) I noticed several smaller red orbs (almost translucent) that weren&#39;t flashing, but consistantly transparent red. There was airline traffic in the vacinity, and could tell very distinctly that these objects did not have the same kind of std. red and white flashing lights like commercial aircraft do.They were moving around the bright object in slow horizontal straight lines north and south and at very slow inclines and descents as to be making passes around the bright sphere, both back and forth. Three hours later I captured some more wierd light patterns which could&#39;ve been mistaken for some type of military craft moving about the sky researching, with no noise. There were plenty of witnesses here, and my son called his friends locally and they saw the lights as well. It was very cold out, and the sky was very clear. The moon was 96% a full moon and was lighting up the sky pretty good. You could see alot of stars, but these objects were all much brighter and did not stay in fixed positions like stars do.<n>

Each light was equally sized and equally spaced from each other forming what appeared to be a perfect triangle. The lights were not moving and remained fixed in the one spot. The lights were too large and in a area which would normally not be traveled by aircraft. I watched as long as possible before losing sight. The lights elevation was above anything fixed on the ground.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Had my eye on it the whole time because it really had me going. It hovers, of course, but sways and turns with the breeze giving the appearance of something shape-changing. Most odd is it&#39;s lighting, which appears to emanate from within the balloon, if that&#39;s possible, and gives off a very bright, eerie, blue/white glow. I travel that route fairly often but have never been able to spot it during the day. At night, however, when it&#39;s lit--which isn&#39;t often--it&#39;s quite startling to see.

I went inside my house to get a camera and when I came out my friend hollared at me and told me that it stopped in the sky and that it was just glowing.  I seen it and started taking pictures of it but then realized that I had no film in my camera so i just used the flash from the camera to try to get its attention.  After flashing twice with the camera&#39;s flash it was responding to use with flashes the same way we were flashing at it. It then moved closer to us and kept flashing even when we didn&#39;t flash back.  We could see an outline of the ship it was diamond shaped and it had no windows it had a glowing bottom that pulsed with yellow and whitish tint.  It made no sound and it just kept flashing at us 2 times.  Then it speeded away at incredible speed to where it just disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

We were facing west. The object appeared to be blinking to the naked eye. We used a pair of binoculars to get a closer look and found the object was not blinking but changing colors. The colors were bluish, greenish and an amber color. It was bright enough not to be able to make out the shape. It stayed in the first location approximately 10 minutes and then disappeared as if it&#39;s lights went out. After about 2 minutes, it re-appeared in a location about 1/4 mile to the southwest of it&#39;s first location. It stayed stationary for about 5 minutes. All of a sudden it streaked off so fast to the south and in less than a second it was gone. The object was about 5 times the size of a plane. There were numerous commercial aircraft flying high above. This is how we determined the size.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

He told me he seen a red light in the skyl. He described it as moving in different directions and abruptly changing speeds.  Another coworker and I went outside to take a look.  Out West miles up in the sky a red light was moving around in straight lines but quickly changing directions.  It was moving about an inches length in distantce if held arms length from the body.  After seeing this for about 25 seconds it changed pattern and moved in a circular motion coming to a stop.  I went inside and told 14 co-workers what me and the other worker had seen.  We all went outside.  I pointed to them the light.  Everybody agreed that it was very redder than a normal star but it had to be a star.  It was not mars.  Just a redder star.  We looked at it for 4 minutes and went back inside.  I stayed inside for ten minutes and went back outside.  It was still there in the same spot.  I looked at it for a few minutes.  I went back inside for another ten minutes and then went back out.  It was still there but its reddish color seemed now to look like a regular light.  I frequently went outside for the next 45 minutes until our time expired.  After work i was telling my boss what I and the other two workers had seen.  Just like we were telling our co-workers during work.  He kept smiling for a couple minutes and then said oh my god.  Do you mean like those.  I looked up in the sky and seen two red lights moving towards the idle white one.  These lights were much closer.  Clouds started to move in from over lake michigan and made viewing the lights difficult.  We noticed three more lights at the same heighth moving in the same direction.  Their view became blocked by clouds.  This event covered about a minute. I figure some planes might have seen this because some did fly near the area.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The area where the sighting took place has been a very active location for numerous sightings over 2002 and 2003. The farm I visited today (February 4, 2003) sits high above the Bulkley Valley and these folks and their neighbors have a terrific view of all the surroundings.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A witness called me on the morning of February 4, 2004 to report that she and her husband both saw something that didn&#39;t look right. The woman gets up early to get her husband and children ready for the day&#39;s work and school. As she made her way through her home at 7:06 a.m. she walked by the kitchen sink, stopped, backed up and gave a call out for her husband to come and have a look at what she was watching.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Both stood inside their home looking out the window at a moon sized object. It&#39;s color was very bright, (a good example would be if you were sitting looking into a camp fire watching the bright colored flames shooting up). This object was &#34;bright&#34;! The witness only could guess as to the shape of it, but thought it was circular. She reported to me the top of the object was domed shaped for sure. (also what is very important in this story is that it was completely dark outside, the sun had not started to rise).<n> <n><n> <n><n> The farm the family owns is very large, and there is a great deal of pasture. From the kitchen where they observed the object, there is a clump of poplar and spruce trees. Then behind that is another opening of pasture area, then another row or clump of trees. In-between these rows of trees, is where the object was seen moving about. Not in an erratic fashion at all, it just dropped down slowly and &#34;stopped&#34;!  Since the orange glowing object was staying stationary at the time, the lady grabbed her video camera and started to shoot some film from the kitchen window. Because what she and her husband were watching was certainly strange looking, she thought about making a move to the outside onto the patio. She ran quickly to the front door, opened it and went outside with video camera in hand. When she looked over to the area where the object was sitting, or had been ....it had vanished. The woman ran back inside to the kitchen window again, and there it was, sitting stationary and shining very brightly. So she shot a little more footage until it just blinked out.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After I took the call about the sighting, I asked was she going to be at home for a while, and if so, I would like to come out to have a look around. I also wanted to take a look at the footage and do the report of the sighting. The witness said it would be fine if I wanted to come up to their home right away, so I grabbed my keys and headed out.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was greeted by the witnesses when I arrived and she explained exactly what they saw, showed me where the object was located and where she was standing when filming. The lady then showed me into the kitchen and told me that this is where she first noticed it. She then took me outside and pointed to where the object was when she tried to capture it on film.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I said you are kidding, because it would not have mattered from either location the lady was filming from, the object should have been visible. With winter here the popular trees had already dropped their leaves months ago. There were not many spruce trees in the area to block out such a large object. Why the witness could not see it when she went outdoors is a mystery to me, there was nothing to block out this large orange glowing object. I could see clearly through the first set of trees to the second row. So why the light disappeared has me baffled.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We went back into the house so she could let me view the footage she shot. What I viewed was a totally blackened area, there was no light from an approaching sunrise. The object as the witness described to me was sitting exactly where she told me it was. It was a brilliant orange light and extremely large in size. Something else I found interesting was one of the larger popular trees which was in front of the light, (closest to their home and at the edge of the open field) there is what looks like a string of lights which is running down the tree. When I first looked at this part in the footage it reminded me as if one was looking at a set of Christmas lights running from the top branches downward to about half the length of the tree. The lights also spread out over a few of the larger branches as well. These streamers of light were also very bright.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I eventually left the witnesses home and drove up the road to look around away from the site where the object had been seen. But from the vantage point I was at now, I was able to look over all the fields and the valley below. I did not see anything out of the norm.

I looked into the clear sky to the north over towards the Rogue Valley VOR (navigation facility)and saw an aircraft, estimated at 10,000 feet, manuvering at very different angles of turns, circles, and other zig-zag patterns.  The aircraft had a red/orange tint with no flashing lights or strobe lights.  This seemed very odd.  I thought for sure it was an F-16 from the K.Falls base doing some fooling around.  I looked for another plane in trail(most travel in pairs), but their was nothing else.<n> <n><n> <n><n> All of the sudden, the aircraft started climbing straight up and disappeared into the night sky.  I watched it as long as my eyes could see it.  It never returned as I stood on the ramp looking for about an additional ten minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was no noise.  I have never seen an aircraft move as quickly as this one.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I departed the airport and contacted Seattle Center for my clearance.  I asked them if they had any traffic on radar over the last 15-20 minutes in the vicinity of MFR.  They said no.  I asked him if there had been any military traffic.  Again the answer was no.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I think I may of seen my first UFO.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The object was in the southern sky travelling in a eastern direction, and it was pretty low between 500 and a 1000 feet aprox.  The object also left a very long vapor trail behind it which hung in the air for aproximatly 20 minutes and had alot of sparks coming from behind it.  I&#39;m pretty sure this wasn&#39;t a meteor cause it was so low and it made no noise at all.

I saw and thought they were some sort of water tank device. I approached and after I took the first couple of steps all three of them shot up into the air about 500 meters as fast as a sling shot and then in a neck snapping move for a normal man, they jolted off at a 90 degree angle and were out of sight within a few seconds. I study physics at uni and I know that they must have broken the sound barrier or gotten close within 4 seconds of take off. The way they sped up from take off at about 200mph and continued to speed up as they made a 90 degree turn from vertical to horizontal at an even higher speed, then sped up so fast that they were out of sight within a few seconds on a sky blue clear day was,...what can I say.

It surprised me since it was very calm at that time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After hearing the noise I looked down at the ground and noticed a strange light...similar to someone from above with a flashlight beam moving in a space about a foot in diameter.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It startled me and I backed up under the overhang and proceeded back into the building. After catching my breath I went back outside where I saw nothing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After the sun came out I went back to the spot where I saw the light, and noticed a patch of green on the concrete in the exact same spot where the light had been. The astroturf carpet under the overhang is green, and there is moss coming from the cracks in the cement. However, after inspecting the green spot I came to the conclusion that it was neither the carpet or the moss. The shade is different, and I had never noticed it before. It is still there.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was a very stressful experience, as I had no idea what had happened to me. And after thinking about it, I started wondering if it was an abduction that went awry as I ducked back into the building before &#39;they&#39; managed to pull me in.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This was also the first time anything like this has ever happened to me.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

We were watching more than 25 jets that either flew northward toward Nashville or flew from west to east above Nashville or south of Nashville, above the town of Murfreesboro.  These jets were at a high altitude and left contrails that changed the sky from clear and bright blue to an almost uniform white haze.<n> <n><n> <n><n> During the 45 minutes that we watched the jets we saw (1) three different single objects and (2) two groups of 5 objects flying together but not in formation.  They remained in one place almost directly overhead, moved quickly from one part of the sky to another part of the sky, and disappeared and reappeared.  These objects were round and ivory-colored with a metallic appearance.  We did not see wings or evidence of propulsion, and we heard no sounds.  The objects were below the haze but seemed to be at a high altitude and small in size.  At any given time, the length of time that we could see the objects was about 1-3 minutes before they would disappear and then reappear in another part of the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> During this time we also saw a free-floating mylar balloon floating high in the sky with the wind, small aircraft, jets in the pattern to land at or take off from the Nashville airport, birds, and the above-mentioned high-flying jets.  The ivory-colored objects did not resemble these other things and flew in different directions (including against the wind).  None of the aircraft in the sky turned to approach or avoid the objects.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We doubt that these objects were very large white birds.  Our better guess is that they were some type of small remote-controlled flying objects.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Any aircraft that was so close to our car would have made some noise. Especially be cause I live near an airport so the sound of planes flying overhead is common.

If the &#34;UFO&#39;s&#34; were in fact in proximity to the Sun from the vantage point of one witness, from another vantage point, they would be in an area of the sky farther away from the Sun, and therefore clearly visible in the daytime sky.

2/1/04 05:06|Los Angeles|CA|Triangle|2 min|2 strange craft over downtown and greater los angeles basin|2/12/04|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/034/S34817.html|297|ndxe200402| I saw an alien.  It&#39;s taken many years to actually say something to someone other than family and friends.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I woke up after midnight and noticed a figure outside the double doors to my bedroom.  I was on the far end of the bed and did not feel afraid.  My first thought was...this is an alien but that is kinda crazy.  Again, I was not afraid (which is a little unlike me and I was not still sleeping).<n> <n><n> <n><n> The alien was short, big head with large eyes.  It also had on an irredescent cloak of some sort.  Its arms were longer than its dress.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I made it around my bed - it stared at me.  It was less than 12 feet away and by the time I made it to my double doors, it lifted its long arm to the other arm and did something.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I took two more steps...it disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I know what I saw was real and changed my belief.  Note:  Two weeks prior I kept hearing someone calling &#34;mom&#34; and nobody was there - I checked my kids and they were fine in bed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> One night, the &#34;voice&#34; called &#34;mom&#34; right next to my ear and I awoke saying &#34;what&#34; and opened my eyes.  Nobody was there.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It woke my husband.  Very strange.<n>
2/1/04 02:00|Birmingham|AL|Chevron|15 sec|Large dark chevron, silently passing overhead in early AM hours, only seen because against star fields.|11/28/07|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/059/S59658.html|298|ndxe200402| We saw some object in the sky move very slowly that was not a plane or a star.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We&#39;re not sure if it is a craft or some object in the sky. My g/f and I were in bed when I looked out the window (in the South West direction) and saw this flashing object in the sky, about the size as any star looks from here. Except it was moving very slowly. Somtimes it would move &#34;less slow&#34; and other times it would just seem to come to a halt. We are sure it moved though. I have it on camera. At one point it seems to have something &#34;break off&#34; of it. Every once in a while it appears to turn to red from blue for short periods of time. We are sure it is not a plane, and we are sure it is not a star in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
