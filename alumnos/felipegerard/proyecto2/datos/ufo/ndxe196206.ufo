I was 12 years old, as were my two friends.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were sitting in the back of a car that was traveling, late at night, through Northern California farmlands...a back highway - of which there were still quite a few in those days.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I don&#39;t remember exactly were we were...hard to know when one isn&#39;t a driver. But about an hour out of the Bay Area...very isolated countryside.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My friend&#39;s parents were driving...they both had had a lot to drink ( were alcoholics, in fact...had my mother known that, I would not have been there).<n> <n><n> <n><n> We heard them say, &#34;Hey! Lookit that! A flying saucer&#34;!, and sitting up &amp; looking out the front window, we could see far down the road up ahead, what looked like a big..thing...hanging in the sky above and near an old, closed roadhouse ( or business of some kind).<n> <n><n> <n><n> We three in the back could not believe our eyes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> While the laughing and hilarity ensued in the front seat , we became very serious.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I know we were worried, and did not want to believe what the adults were saying. So as we approached it, we discussed what it was NOT.  We were trying to be the adults in that car.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Not aiplane, heliocoptor, tower,clouds, balloon, blimp, lights in the sky...<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was a very large circular metallic (ship was inescapable in our minds, because that is what it looked like) object just hanging there in the sky. The night was clear, and we saw it VERY clearly...it was not far up . It was large...larger than he building it was near.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There were lights around the perimeter, and it was clearly dimensional...not flat. There was also a set of lights, on another, smaller object, that was flying around the big one...but in an irregular, darting manner.<n> <n><n> <n><n> And nothing supported it...it was sitting in the air.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We drove almost underneath it ( not quite, as it was off the road to the left), and the adults stopped the car ( laughing) to look at it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I think it may have been me who said &#34; Go!! Please go!&#34;. All three of us in the back were scared, because we knew we were seeing something that ..should not be.<n> <n><n> <n><n> And we three turned in our seats and watched it recede...for a very long time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The next day, my friend&#39;s parents dismissed it, angrily.  Did not want to talk about it....I think they were so inebriated at the time that they did not remember much.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Years later, when I started college, I ran into my friend from the car...we had lost touch.<n> <n><n> <n><n> And the very first thing she said to me - before hello!- was &#34; Do you remember what we saw?&#34;  It had affected her as it did me...we saw something extraordinary and not easily explained.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ( And Cheri - who saw it too - if you see this,look for me on Facebook using my maiden name - there will be another as well.)<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

But there was a huge presence that firghtend me.  And I hid in my dads car.  I believe the liights were no completely in focus. And were blurry sometimes. The next day a Goodyear blimp flew over  and had lights on Thea side  it was not he same in anyway<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

It was in the evening and still light out.  I was on the porch of a friend of mine and turned and looked up at the flashing lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It hung in the air, didn’t make a sound.  Was kind of a cigar shaped disc with odd shaped windows in it that glowed red green, yellow and gold.  When it did take off it made no sound what so ever and kind of left a gold sparkle trail that hung in the air for a few seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So glad to see that I was not the only one to see it...   At the time I went to two different houses to have an adult look and see what it was.  Well they looked and slammed the door in my face like they were afraid of what they saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Since this time I’ve seen one in Arizona at the border of AZ and Mexico border and one in Dayton Tex...   There is something out there.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))<n>
6/30/62 07:00|Cadiz|CA|Unknown|10 seconds|We saw a silver brushed sillhoutte about the size of a person floating about 1-2 ft above the ground with no features of any sort.|12/12/11|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/085/S85317.html|4|ndxe196206| We saw a silver brushed sillhoutte about the size of a person floating about 1-2 ft above the ground with no features of any sort.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This statement is made to the best of my memory.  It&#39;s about an incident that several friends and myself experienced when we were kids around the age of 11 - maybe 1962?.   We lived in the Mojave Desert in a little town called Cadiz, California.  This little town was a railroad living community where Santa Fe employees and their families resided.  Santa Fe provided homes, water, and electricity.   Most homes were cement type dwellings and a few corrugated metal garages were also built.    The Santa Fe Depot and  living community was approximately 1 mile West of our area, and Chambless was around 3 miles away located adjacent to Route 66.  It was a great place to live.<n> <n><n> <n><n> People from both communities consisted of many races;  Mexicans, Navajo, Hopi and Apache, Blacks and White people.  Some workers were seasonal or transients while others remained on permanent status.  I guess you would have considered us permanent.  Those in the 1st to 8th grade attended Amboy School around 17 miles away and rode in a bus to school.  We had quite a few kids living in the surrounding area that attended Amboy school.   This above these grades would go to junior high and high school in Needles CA.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Often we would gather and play various games, cowboys and Indians, dodge ball, kick ball, and others, but on this particular night when we saw what we saw, I think we were playing Mexican Ring or Kick the can.   I believe the moon was full because I seem to remember the darkness and light and shadows and the &#34;thing&#34; was partially lit by the moonlight because it was floating about 1 foot off the ground beside a salt tree near a fuel storage shed that was  circular built from corrugated metal.  Many years later I realized the best way to describe what the &#34;thing&#34;  looks is a 500yrd Echo target used by USMC for marksmanship training.  It&#39;s shape was close to the photo and had a brushed silver metallic look  – not shinny.   It may have been about 2/3 the size of a home entry door or a real person, width was a little less than a door.   It did not move or make noise, it just floated in the air.    I don&#39;t recall any distinguishing marks, just a dull silver look and of course not flat as this photo.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The building layout on the PDF may be a little off but I hope it gives a good perspective for my explanation.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were playing between the bathrooms and showers, red area surrounding the pink area,.   I think the game was either  Mexican ring or kick the can, tag games.  It was getting dark, mom came out and told us to call it a night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As a group we always walked our two friends (oldest and younger brother) home after playing since their house was the furthest from the group of homes (blue line to foreman&#39;s).   We were aware of a dog that sometimes got loose and bit people, he usually hung out in the area marked - we kept an eye out for him that evening.   As a group we walked towards the fence and then along the fence to the foreman&#39;s house.   I’m not sure who it was, but someone screamed &#34;black dog,&#34; we all ran and somehow formed a single file and ran as fast as we could.  The next day we realized it was actually some buried pieces of railroad ties that protected a gas or water line.   The older brother was first, the younger second and I was 3rd and the rest were behind me.   We were all glancing back and forth  while running to see if the black dog was going to introduce himself, that&#39;s when I ran into the younger brother.  I realized the younger brother had run into the older brother, of course it was! my turn and the others ran into me.   The older brother moved quickly and had already taken many strides in the opposite direction.   The younger brother was next and on his older brothers tail moving faster than I had ever seen him run,  it was then when I saw what they were running from.  I to ran in their direction but not as fast as they did.  I recall I was curious but not scared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I caught up with them inside and we went towards moms front door (red arrow).  The others as I recall followed us but did not see a thing, they thought the back dog had gotten loose and ran away.   At mom&#39;s house we explained what we had seen.  Mom gave both brothers a pinch of salt to calm them down  - not sure it worked at all.  I recall Mom and Dad taking the two brothers home in a yellow Ford station wagon.  They were scared half to death especially the older brother, I just thought it was cool.   We talked about it the following day and I went to the site and checked the area for anything left behind or something unusual.  I don&#39;t recall if any of the brothers came with me, they usually did, but I&#39;m sure the older brother would not.    The younger brother brought up an interesting point that I did not notice – while describing the thing to each other, he said it had what looked like a baby moon hub cap on its head.   We all agreed it was like a silver silhouette of a pe! rson floating off the ground.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A few years ago around 2005, I saw the younger brother that I had not seen for many years at a family function, we talked about the incident and got some pretty good size goose bumps.  Both brothers live in the Barstow CA area today; the other friends  are no longer with us, most moved to the Navajo reservation and are deceased.  We moved out of the desert to the big city of San Bernardino during this period due to dad&#39;s job with Santa Fe.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had forgotten this event for many years and I&#39;m not sure why I remembered.   I&#39;m now 59 years old, I know what I saw and want to share it with you because in the &#34;I know what I saw&#34; television program I saw a symbol that closely resembled the thing we saw that night.  I have never ever see anything like this symbol in photos, magazines or television shows that even came close to resembling this  item until I saw the program.  I&#39;ve tried to contact Mr. Fox the producer of &#34;I Know what I saw&#34; several times but he has not responded.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Cadiz is now gone and it is hard to tell where buildings were.  It&#39;s sand and rocks now with a few small salt trees.  I&#39;ve visited the area on several occasions to see if I could discern anything - it&#39;s tough to figure the place settings today.   But it sure was  a brief but interesting event that several of us experienced years ago that we still remember.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

I was a good sleeper, but I awoke in the middle of the night one night and decided to turn on my light and read for a while.  It was probably about 2:00 am.  The entire house (indeed, the entire neighborhood) was dark except for my little lamp which was mounted on the wall above my headboard.  I don&#39;t know what made me turn my head toward the window, but when I did, I saw an object the size and shape of a ping-pong ball floating slowly toward me, horizontal to the ground.  It was as if it were trying to observe me.  Of course I was scared to death.  I quickly turned out my light, then after a few minutes woke my foster brother who made fun of me for the rest of the time he was with my family.  The only explanations I have been able to rationalize have been 1) a moth and 2) a headlight, but only 3) a &#34;probe&#34; of some sort ultimately makes any sense.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

He had always been a down to earth man and I could not believe what he said.  I am searching for others who may know what he was talking of.  It was 1960 something, he was with his first wife.  They were heading towards Orlando on a main highway of the time.  They were passing a lake and saw a sphere hovering over it.  He stopped and got out, stood and watched the thing for 25 or more minutes.  He said it was sphere shaped and had lights circling it around its equater.  The lights started spinning faster and it rose up just a little.  Then he said it shot off into the distance.  He said it didn&#39;t disappear, he could see it as it went into the distance, but so fast it was as if it just disappeared.  He said there was no sound of machinery and no thunder as it shot through the air.  He went on to say that others who had seen it said they had seen a pole or something in the water and that it retracted before it rose up...as if it were taking on water.  He said he saw nothing of the sort and that he had a very good view.  This was in broad daylight and is very adament that he knows there is extra terrestrial life due to what he saw.  I have known him for 28 years now and the story is so uncharacteristic, I believe him.  Can anyone give me insight as to a particular sighting that this may have been?  He said others saw it.<n>

There were eight of them the size of Venus when it’s closest to the earth. They were a brilliant purplish blue and moved across the sky in a circle (formation) pattern. The pattern was about the width of a softball held at arms length. They stopped almost directly overhead and spun in a clockwise motion for three revolutions, fully stopped, then came together in the center of a circle stopped, and immediately sped off in different directions like the spokes of a bicycle wheel. It was a clear starry night at 11:30 PM. We were raised in a Christian foster home and weren’t allowed to watch television. Also we didn’t, or don’t have reason to lie. (Unfortunately my younger brother passed away six years ago)  We had been at Crescent beach on a camping trip for the weekend (Friday, Saturday and Picked up Sunday morning), just him and I. The nearest airport was 15 miles away in Port Angeles. These lights made no sound and didn’t move like airplanes we had seen in 1962. The closest house was maybe one mile away and behind trees. I thought of this incident because my 10 year old son had asked me “Where’s the other moon dad?” That’s the exact same question I had asked my foster parents 44 years ago with the same tone in my voice. It made all the hairs on my body stand up.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date of event may be approximate, although the witness does not indicate that fact.  PD))<n>

The location is rural southern Illinois within two miles of the Indiana state line. The time is 9:30 PM, within a few minutes of accuracy.  I am 16 yrs. of age; having become a licensed driver a couple of months previous, I had borrowed my mother’s car to visit girlfriends in a nearby town across the Indiana line.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was subject to a 10:00 PM curfew, so I departed my friend’s home at about 9:20 knowing that the journey would take approximately 20 minutes to my home.  It was a mild summer evening of clear skies and slender crescent moon.  As there are no towns of any size within 70 miles, the sky was studded with stars.  The night was so beautiful I decided to put the top down on my mother’s convertible and take the old state road through the agriculture fields and drive leisurely rather than the new divided highway which ran parallel about a mile away.  I knew there was little likelihood of encountering other traffic as this stretch of road was mainly used by farm equipment during the day.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The terrain in this area is very flat, and I would be traversing through about 8 miles of crop fields of mainly corn, wheat, and melons.  The road runs almost arrow straight and is very dark as no farm buildings or houses are near the road.  There are many small creeks, which meander and  crisscross through these fields.  When the fields were originally cleared for crops, ribbons of trees and shrubs along the creek edges, and sometimes just to divide fields in general were left intact.  None of these trees would be considered “giant”, the tallest in the range of 60 feet.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After crossing the state line from Indiana and making a left turn on the farming road heading due west, I almost immediately saw a very large, bright glowing below the tree line just beyond the second creek crossing on the left.  My first thought was that it must be a large piece of farm equipment such as a combine, but I immediately dismissed this as it was too late for planting, and way too early for harvest, the corn being about one to two feet in height.  The light was so large and so startling that I reduced my speed to a crawl, turned off the headlights &amp; radio.  This didn’t seem dangerous as I saw no traffic in either direction, and the light was definitely over a field and not something on the road.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I continued to proceed at a snail&#39;s pace until I passed the second ribbon of trees along a creekbed and was directly in view of the light.  At this point I pulled over to the shoulder and parked.  I exited the car in a state of utter amazement &amp; astonishment.  Hovering motionless and soundless about 25 feet in front of me and about 25 feet above the corn was an object.  It was glowing over its’ entire surface with diffuse white light.  The light was bright, but not so bright that it was painful to stare at, and clearly visible through the light was a silver metal craft that appeared to be elliptical in shape.  The field it was hovering over was approximately the size of a football field and this object was covering more than half of it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I walked to the other side of the road nearer to the object and as well a bit down the road to be sure my estimation of the shape and dimensions were accurate; and to see if I could discern any thing like windows or doors or markings, but I could not.  At this point I was wishing another car would come along as I was feeling a bit vulnerable and knew that no one would believe me if I told about it.  After a few minutes of captivated astonishment, I began to question myself as to whether I had the courage to walk into the field directly under it.  Intense curiosity was overtaking me, but I decided that walking under it might not be a good idea.  I then had the thought that I was trembling probably in fear, which caused me to actually pay attention to my body, and realized that I was not really afraid nor was I trembling.  The actual feeling in my body was as if every atom was slightly vibrating.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After a few more minutes I decided to throw caution to the wind walk into the field. Just as I reached the corn and the edge under the craft, it began to rise slowly, smoothly and silently. At this point I began to back away onto the road.  When it reached and cleared the top of the trees, it accelerated and climbed rapidly in a southerly direction.  Within 3 to 4 seconds it was no longer visible.  As it departed it emitted a spray of multicolored sparkling particles that drifted down on top of the corn and dissipated.  At this point I was grateful that I wasn’t directly under when it departed.  I suspected those sparkling particles might have been dangerous/hazardous to my health and well being.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I got back in the car and sat there a few more minutes in awe at what I had witnessed, and realized that I would probably never tell my family, friends, or anyone about this experience.  The entire event lasted approximately 15 minutes.  Prior to this experience I had heard of UFO sightings but in typical teenage fashion of the day I thought they were mainly reported by  uneducated people who lived in trailer parks and wore tin foil hats.  My main concerns at the time centered about clothes, hair, make-up &amp; boys.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It sounds like this is the end of the experience, but it isn’t.  My mother’s car at the time was late model 50’s and had neither a clock nor seatbelts.  I knew what time I had departed my friend’s house (9:20 PM) and despite the time spent on the event on the way home, I expected to still be on time for my curfew at 10:00 PM.  When I arrived home and glanced at the kitchen clock upon entering, I received a profound shock.  Something was wrong with time!  I was not missing time, but apparently had gained time.  I had arrived home in less than five minutes after departing my friends’ house.  I immediately checked this clock against others in the house and against TV programming and it appeared accurate.  I phoned my friend the following day to verify what time I had left her house.  To this day I cannot reconcile these facts.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We express our sincere gratitude to the source of the report for her having taken the time to prepare such a lucid and detailed account of her experience.

Good long view, good details.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My father and Uncle took me along on an evening fishing trip. I have clear memories of this evening...even to the clothes I was wearing. I remember I sat in the ashes of a previous campfire and my father told me that my mom was going to spank me for ruining my clothes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were sitting on the river bank with my father on my right side and my Uncle on my left. My Uncle had a clear space on his left, but my father had a large tree (oak?) on his right. It was leaning out over the water as river-bank trees are wont to do. As a result of this every so often, my fathers line would snag in the overhanging tree branches. He would curse and reel the line back in. Although there were trees to the sides of our spot, there were none directly over head.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My father had just cast his line and it must have snagged the tree, because something made him look up. I felt him go very still. He nudged me and said &#34;K., look up.&#34; I looked up and directly over our heads was a very large flying saucer. It looked as big as a house....bigger. I could see that it was bigger than the relative size of the large tree beside my father...even at the height it was at. Which seemed to be not much higher than the tree top.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The sky was black and there was no moon that I recall or could see, but I could see this object very clearly. Obviously it was round. It had 6 round white lights on the bottom. 5 surrounding one, all the same size, and the 5 rotated counter-clockwise. It was dead silent. It was a silvery pewter color. Not shiny, and as I recall with....seams in the metal. In other words, it was not a perfectly smooth skin. I knew I was seeing something extrodinary, but I wasn&#39;t the least bit frightened. We watched it as it crossed the river. As it got about half way across, I saw that it was a shallow dome, like a lens. But instead of a smooth top, it had a little bump on top. A true dome that sat in the center of the ship. One the right upper side of the dome was a white light. The color of an incandescent light bulb. (in contrast to the lights on the bottom which looked more &#34;bluish&#34; and did not &#34;shine&#34; like a light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It crossed the river slowly and moved on a little further. Then it hovered for just a moment. Then it just dropped slowly into the woods. I looked at my father. He was still looking across the river. I guess they figured that they were far enough away, because as I recall, my father and uncle kept right on fishing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I was young and it was late, I don&#39;t recall going home. I was most likely asleep.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>
6/15/62 19:30|Lawrence County (rural agriculture field)|IL|Disk|15 minutes|My motivation is to have this report of unknown craft observed at close range included in a database|6/2/13|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/097/S97838.html|12|ndxe196206| My motivation is to have this report of unknown craft observed at close range included in a database<n> <n><n> <n><n> The year is 1962 and the month is June.  The location is rural southern Illinois within two miles of the Indiana state line.  The time is 9:30 PM, within a few minutes of accuracy.  I am 16yrs. of age; having become a licensed driver a couple of months previous, and with permission had borrowed my mother’s car to visit girlfriends in a nearby town across the Indiana line.  I was subject to a 10:00 PM curfew, so I departed my friend’s home at about 9:20 knowing that the journey would take approximately 20 minutes to my home.  It was a mild summer evening of clear skies and slender crescent moon.  As there are no towns of any size within 70 miles, the sky was studded with stars.  The night was so beautiful I decided to put the top down on my mother’s convertible and take the old state road through the agriculture fields and drive leisurely rather the new divided highway which ran parallel about a mile away.  I knew there was little likelihood of encountering other traffic as this stretch of road was mainly used by farm equipment during the day.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The terrain in this area is very flat, and I would be traversing through about 8 miles of crop fields of mainly corn, wheat, and melons.  There are many small creeks, which meander and crisscross through these fields.  When the fields were originally cleared for crops, ribbons of trees and shrubs along the creek edges, and sometimes just to divide fields in general were left intact.  None of these trees would be considered “giant”, the tallest in the range of 60 feet.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After crossing the state line from Indiana and making a left turn on the farming road heading due west, I almost immediately saw a very large, bright glowing below the tree line just beyond the second creek crossing on the left.  My first thought was that it must be a large piece of farm equipment such as a combine, but I immediately dismissed this as it was too late for planting, and way too early for harvest, the corn being about one to two feet in height.  The light was so large and so startling that I reduced my speed to a crawl, turned off the headlights &amp; radio.  This didn’t seem dangerous as I saw no traffic in either direction, and the light was definitely over a field and not something on the road.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I continued to proceed at a snails pace until I passed the second ribbon of trees along a creekbed and was directly in view of the light.  At this point I pulled over to the shoulder and parked.  I exited the car in a state of utter amazement &amp; astonishment.  Hovering motionless and soundless about 25 feet in front of me and about 25 feet above the corn was an object.  It was glowing over its entire surface with diffuse white light.  The light was bright, but not so bright that it was painful to stare at, and clearly visible through the light was a silver metal craft that appeared to be elliptical in shape.  The field it was hovering over was approximately the size of a football field and this object was covering more than half of it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I walked to the other side of the road nearer to the object and as well a bit down the road to be sure my estimation of the shape and dimensions were accurate, and to see if I could discern any thing like windows or doors or markings, but I could not.  At this point I was wishing another car would come along, as I knew that no one would believe me if I told about it.  After a few minutes of captivated astonishment, I began to question myself as to whether I had the courage to walk into the field directly under it.  Intense curiosity was overtaking me, but I decided that walking under it might not be a good idea.  I then had the thought that I was trembling, probably in fear, which caused me to actually pay attention to my body, and realized that I was not really afraid, nor was I trembling.  The actual feeling in my body was as if every atom was slightly vibrating.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After a few more minutes I decided to throw caution to the wind walk into the field.  Just as I reached the corn and the edge of the craft, it began to rise slowly and smoothly and silently.  When it reached and cleared the top of the trees, it accelerated and climbed rapidly in a southerly direction.  Within 3 to 4 seconds it was no longer visible.  As it departed it emitted a spray of multicolored sparkling particles that drifted down on top of the corn and dissipated.  At this point I was grateful that I wasn’t directly under when it departed.  I suspected those sparkling particles might have been dangerous/hazardous to my health and well being.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I got back in the car and sat there a few more minutes in awe at what I had witnessed, and realized that I would probably never tell my family, friends, or anyone about this experience.  The entire event lasted approximately 15 minutes.  Prior to this experience I had heard of UFO sightings but in typical teenage fashion of the day I thought they were mainly reported by uneducated people who lived in trailer parks and wore tin foil hats.  My main concerns at the time centered about clothes, hair, make-up &amp; boys.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It sounds like this is the end of the experience, but it isn’t.  My mother’s car at the time was late model 50’s and had neither a clock nor seatbelts.  I knew what time I had departed my friend’s house (9:20 PM) and despite the time spent on the event on the way home, I expected to still be on time for my curfew at 10:00 PM.  When I arrived home and glanced at the kitchen clock upon entering, I received a profound shock.  Something was wrong with time!  I was not missing time, but apparently had gained time.  I had arrived home in less than five minutes after departing my friends’ house.  I immediately checked this clock against others in the house and against TV programming and it appeared accurate.  I phoned my friend the following day to verify what time I had left her house.  To this day I cannot reconcile these facts.<n>

Sometime in the night I was brought almost out of sleep , not quit awake, and heard .  ((name deleted)), I said what . Do you want to fly. I said what like superman. and they said yes. I right away said yes. This is when I heard them giggle.  Yes there was 2 of them.Through all of this I never saw them. The next thing I know they had me by each arm and was going through the bedroom wall through the hallway walls and out onto the front porch, were they put me down. The front porch did not have a railing on it . They said ok fly.I said how? just go.  So I jumped of like I have done before.  I expected to land on the ground. I did not fall . I floated. I remembered how superman flyes.  Put 1 hand out and 1 knee up and I started to move forward.  We lived on a corner, so I flew around the intersection in a circle and back to the porch. They said we have to go now and reached out for me but I was to fast . I! jumped again and flew to the opp. corner.Where I hovered and knew if I came back to my porch I would not fly again. So I tried to see how high I could go.  I rememberd hovering behind the blue spruce x-mas. tree on the opp. corner. Then I started up. I went up under my control and remembed saying I wonder how high I could go.  Well this is were I found out I was not in control anymore .  I said well I guess Im going to find out.  I looked down opon my house and could see into my parents bedroom that was on the 2nd floor . I was realy high.I started to look up to see were I was going and thats the last thing I remembered untill the next morning. I told my mother about this and she quiessed me but was not to sure so nothing else was said .<n> <n><n> <n><n> Now through all this I did not smell or hear anything but them . There was a light blue light on everything. I was not harmed so I call them friends because they let me fly. It is my beleaf that they seperate you soul from your body . While I was flying they were doing things to my body. I am having problems with my gut now and I wonder if thats related or not.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I swear every word of this is true. I swear !  Later on in life I heard of the Linda Corteil case. I felt better when I did. My case happened 20 years before hers.<n>

The back door on inspection was locked, which would have been an unusual move by an intruder, not to mention his calmness,also our alsation dog did not bark which was even more unusual. My dad put a extra lock on the back door on the inside the very next day.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Not long after this maybe a week or two I thought it was quite natural for me, and still did for 40yrs till last night, to go and sleep in the back room adjacent to the back door on JUST this one night I don&#39;t recall ever doing that before or since..What followed was the most terrifying &#34;dream&#34; of my entire life.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was sitting up looking out the window, I dont know why or for how long when two men approached the back door. I am filled with fear again just writing that but I will press on. One was tall, with blonde hair, normal looking except that his facial expression belied greater intelligence and knowledge as well as the following- impatience with the other fellow and certitude that they would succed this time and, that it was unquestionably necessary to do. The other fellow was shorter, seemed inferior. I dont remember their dress exactly but it was nothing out of the ordinary. It took about a second or two to register all this . The rest of the time as they came through the back door(not the door to my room  but the room next to it, the kitchen) I dont remember the actual mechanics of this entrance except that it seemed &#34;normal&#34; at the time I was occupyed being terrified beyond belief and trying incessantly with all my might to scream but my throat was paralysed frozen and nothing came out which terrified me even more because I could not get help.The next thing I remember was being in the exact same position,(sitting up in bed looking out the window)  but without fear completely relaxed but with a keen perception of missing time. the two were gone.Also conciously observing myself and from this concious self observation I was able to have a sense of something missing between that and the previous memory despite the fact that I was in exactly the same physical position. I felt that that had been planned that way.I could go on to detail subsequent ufo experiences including the exact same man in my adult life which then and through reading threw light on this first known experience but I&#39;m afraid it would take too long.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

When my mother ran out to me, it flew away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was a small boy when this event happened to me.  This took place in late summer around 6:30 p.m.  It was in the evening and still light outside.  This was at my grandparents farm.  They were away on a trip and my mother and I went out to water plants and feed the dogs for them.  My mother was inside watering the plants.  I was outside by myself when all of a sudden I looked up and saw this silver object come  over the house and out to the back between the house and barn.  I think it was going to land.  It was a silver object with a dome in the center and round windows all around it.  It made no sound except a humming sound.  It began a slow decent around 25 feet from me.  All of a sudden my mother comes running out of the house towards me.  At this time the craft was maybe 15 or 20 feet from the ground.  As my mother neared me it began to go up very slowly to around maybe 150 feet, them zipped very quickly to the east.  My mother thought there intentions was to pick me up.  After this happened I had an encounter with a &#34;man in black.&#34;  Through the next several years me, my mother, brother and aunt had several sightings in the same area.  We seem to think maybe they somehow know us.  Is this possible?  Do you want me to Email you about my &#34;men in black&#34; experience?  Also about our other sightings?  We never reported any of this and not told hardly anyone about this.  I thought since this is your business I would write you.  Thank you.<n>

Forgive the lack of information on this as it was over thirty years ago. I was lying on my front lawn looking easterly at the stars and as I was focused on two stars no more than 1- 2 inches apart I saw a star like light go from the southern star to the northern one. The light appeared to be as large as the two stars and did not diminish the star departed nor in- crease the star arrived upon. There were no flareups and no noises. I continued to watch but witnessed nothing further. They were medium in brightness and viewed by the naked eye.<n>

I was about 13 at the time.  I was coming home from a store and had just turned right from Persia Avenue onto London Street.  I had gone about 50 feet when something made me turn around.  Above London Street, and I would guess at an altitude of about 1000 fee, was this round bright white light.  It wasn&#39;t bright enough to cause me to cover my eyes, but kept me watching.  There were no blinking lights, no sound and being one block from Mission Street, a very busy street, it was strange that there were no street noises.  I watched this light for about 15 minutes.  When it dipped slightly on the south western side of the object and headed out.  It disappeared in a matter of seconds.  I went home, told my mother about it and I went to our kitchen window which faced toward Mount Davidson and to the West.  I could again see 2 bright objects, the same type I had seen about 10 minutes before, head from South to North, the around Twin Peaks, head due West where they disappeared from sight.  That has been my only encounter with a UFO.<n>

The lights were around the middle.

She looked up but couldn&#39;t see it and as I pointed up to show her where it was it just disapeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> She went back in to finish lunch.  I was surprised that it was gone and then started to feel sick to my stomach.  Thinking it was the Kool-Aid I threw it down and then started to feel dizzy so went to bed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> That night my parents had to take me to the emergency room because I had hemoraged all over my pillow.

She looked up and said where, I don&#39;t see it.  I pointed up to it and before I could say anything it was gone in a blink.  Before I could pull down my pointing arm I felt light headed and almost fell off the porch.  My mother went inside and was complaining about burning the eggs.  I went straight to bed.  That evening when my father came home (He worked at the air base), I remember they both got me up and took me to the ER because my tonsils had hemoraged all over my pillow.
