We spoke with this witness via telephone, and he sounded quite sober-minded, and quite serious about the incident.  He stated that he had submitted a much longer statement than that which appears above.  However, it did not arrive at our Center, possibly because he submitted the report, using his cell telephone.  He said that he would submit a second report, using a friend&#39;s computer.  His recollection of the incident has disturbed him for the last 43 years, he reports.  PD))<n>
2/21/63 21:30|Cape May Court House|NJ|Unknown|3 to 4 min.|This incident happened in the early 60's and I still remember it like it happened yesterday. It scared the crap out of me!!!|4/27/04|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/036/S36119.html|2|ndxe196302| This incident happened in the early 60&#39;s and I still remember it like it happened yesterday. It scared the crap out of me!!!<n> <n><n> <n><n> &gt;This event happened during the height of the worst NorthEaster the Jersey Cape had in my lifetime. It may have been 1962, but I reported above 63. I&#39;m not sure, I am sure it is a matter of record, I can&#39;t recal the exact day either. &gt;Myself and two highschool buddies were cutting thru backyards in my neighborhood. The clouds were very low to the ground and the winds were at gale force. &gt;Three extremely bright lights stopped over head and hovered. That is to say, they never stopped moving, but they didn&#39;t change direction (up, down, forward, back) for several min. They continued moving in a pattern that could best be likened to someone brading rope. It could NOT have been rotating spotlights on a helcopter, I don&#39;t know how you would get lights to rotate in that fashion. The movement was also uneffected by the gale force winds. Except for the unusual pattern there was no other movement. &gt;There was also no other sound than the wind blowing thru the trees. These lights could not have been more than 300 feet off the ground. Because of the intensity of the lights, you could not see any other details. &gt;This event scared me so much, I remember it like it was yesterday. I&#39;ve lost track of the other two individuals involved, but the unusual thing is: neither of these two individuals could remember it the next time we saw each other. I thought that was odd at the time, but didn&#39;t give it any more thought until years later. My interest in Coast to Coast has has made aware of what may have happened. I might also add, I&#39;ve noticed street lights go out around me all the time. I started noticing this as far back as the early eighties, and have been telling my close firends about for years.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.
