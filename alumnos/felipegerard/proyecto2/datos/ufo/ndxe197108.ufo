It was void of any sound and brilliant in color.|8/30/99|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/008/S08671.html|1|ndxe197108| A round &#34;orange&#34; ball, was seen by me approximately 12&#39; over the top of my vehicle. It was void of any sound and brilliant in color.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was driving my girl friend back from the ice cream store, we were on cook road in either North Ridgeville or North Olmsted,not sure of the border. We were heading west. It was approx. 9:30 pm, and I remember this because I played football and it was during the time of 2 a days. It was after practice. As we were travelling about 30 - 40 mph, I said in a panic voice, &#34;it&#39;s gonna to crash&#34;. Just above the tree line, to the left side of the road,I noticed a bright orange light moving from left to right,in front on us. I remember thinking at the time that the plane was on fire and it would certainly hit us. I slammed on the brakes. We came sliding to a stop in the center of the road, pointed slightly to the left, as I was going to veer under the plane as it went over the car, Cindy and I both noticed the orange glow off the chrome and the hood of the car. I tried to get out, but, the door was locked. I unlocked the door and got out. This is the scary part. I looked up and there was a perfectly round, bright orange, semi opague, 10 - 15 ft diameter, ball. I was so close to it, that if I had a step ladder and a broom, I could have hit it. No sound. I stood in amazement for about 5 to 7 seconds. Then I realized then what I was seeing. I was in awe. The object remained motionless. Then without warning it shot to the north towards lake Erie. It moved so fast I was barely able to follow it. It went out of sight. That was it. I lost time however, about 2 hours, I think. I have the need now after almost 30 years to try and find some answers. I hope I can speak with someone, not involved with the government. Thanks, ((initials deleted)) I am 45 years old. College educated. Normal average American. I am Not a Quack. I just would like to search for some answers.<n>

The object was only 20 feet above the building which gave me a perfect viewing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I opened the window and looked at how close this object was.  I saw no windows but multicolored lights circumnavigating the object like you would see on an outdoor theater displaying the features at the show.  The disc reminded me of a football shape.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I shouted at a guard passing on the same side of the street to come across the street and look up.  He witnessed it as well.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I ran down the stairs of the barracks to alert the watchman and by the time we both observed this object we saw it jet upwards at an angle with no sound and disappear into the night sky like an open shutter on a camera, leaving a trail of light behind it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have been an avid UFO watcher with interest since I was a teenager.  I have shared this story with hundreds of people and even an astronaut that visited our neighboring community several years ago.  He walked on the moon and said he had witnessed UFO&#39;s himself.  I am a true believer!<n>
8/17/71 22:15|Quonsett Pt.

It was a &#34;being&#34;.  It was a Wednesday night approximately 22:15 and I was working as a waiter at the Quonsett Poin Naval Air Station Officers Club.  We had just closed an outdoor steak cookout and were cleaning up.  The area was about 1/3rd the size of a football field with high strong &#34;ball field&#34; type lights on poles and other lighting on the building facing the yard.  The yard was bordered on two sides by high underbrush like reeds or canes and the area behind that was marshy the building on the third side and the pool on the last. Additionally the wooded area bordered the actual airfield, hangers and buildings.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was returning to the area from inside to bring more things into the kitchen. The doorway was on a slight rise (one level) above the picnic area so visibity was not blocked.  I saw this &#34;being&#34; walking away from the eating area at a moderate speed (no rush), pause a little before entering the reeds look ove the shoulder at the area and in my direction the immediately enter the reeds.  I do not know if I was seen as I was standing still and above the level plain with lights at my back.  I had been away from the picnic area 5 or 10 minutes before going back outside. I had made several trips in and out.  As someone else had been working with me off and on I looked to see if they had come out and seen the same thing.  I was alone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The &#34;being&#34; was about 5 to 5 1/2 ft tall thin, but not skinny and did not have an oversized head. Because of the lighting and location I did not notice any coloring. Everything was pale grey or dull silver. It appeared to have a one pc suit of clothing with no cuffs, pockets or closures. No helmet or head covering. The face was very human and I did not notice any head hair.  It was not carring anything or holding anything. It showed no surprise when it looked in my direction.  Just one look back over the shoulder, and he went into the brush.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I did not mention this to anyone at the time as I didn&#39;t want anyone to think I was looney.  I checked local newspapers and other media over the next few days to see if anyone else reported anything or there were any reports.  I had recently been sworn into the Air Force as a Second LT. and was waiting assignment (in November 1971).  I did not want to jeprodise my future as a pilot with some big investigation.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Some years later I found out the area behind the marsh also contained ammo bunkers and the Nuclear weapon bunker.  I have never seen any reports of something happening at this time in this area and have told very few about it.  The whole thing is still very vivid in my mind.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.  PD))<n>

On approximately August 17, 1971, I was attending a Union meeting at a local motel and was asked by the Union rep. if I and another worker would go across the river to Nuevo Laredo, Mexico and pick up a couple of bottles of liqour for the group. My friend and I left, crossed the border and approached a place where he said we could get the best prices. As we were pulling up to park, I noticed people on the street (women and children) looking up at the sky. When we alit from the car we both looked toward the West where everyone was looking and was startled to see 4 large round red circles hovering just above the horizon. It was approximately 18:30 hours and the sun was just starting to set, so there was still plenty of daylight. As we watched, I started looking in other directions and discovered another 5 of the same objects coming from the North (from the direction of Laredo, TX). They approached the other 4 slowly and then grouped together and then started to get smaller. They kept getting smaller until they completely diappeared. I don&#39;t know if they were moving away from us or if they just got smaller until they disappeared. Laredo Air Force Base was still there at the time and I thought of calling the base when we returned to Laredo, but then decided not to because I figured the lines would be jammed with calls. To my astonishment the next day, not a single thing appeared in the local newspaper nor the Mexican newspapers.  No radio or TV reports either. My buddy and I just kept our mouths shut. I found all that very strange. I am and will always be a firm believer in UFO&#39;s. And I believe, someday, everyone else will, too.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date may be approximate.

We were leaving.  The sky was clear.  It was about 11 PM.  Several of us were walking down their drive way, we were facing east.  A very bright light, it looked more like a round glob of intense white light streaked from west to east over our heads.  There was no noise.  It went from above us to the horizon in a couple of seconds.  I asked what it was and just started up at the sky.  A few seconds later two objects indentcal to the first streaked overhead going the same direction.  I had spent four years in the Air Force were I had worked on the radar and weapons systems electronics.  Any plane I had seen could not have appeared to move that fast unless it had been on the deck and moving at least a couple hundred miles an hour.  In which case there would have been not silence but at very loud roar.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Time and date are approximate.  PD))<n>
8/15/71 19:00|Beavercreek|OH|Light||Light chashing USAF transport.|12/12/11|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/084/S84933.html|6|ndxe197108| Light chashing USAF transport.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This sighting occurred on a late summer evening, just before dark in the early 70s.   I was in my early teens, and we lived in rural Greene Co, between Xenia and Beavercreek, Ohio.   At the time the area was all farm land with just a smattering of old farm houses, including our home.  My younger brother and I were in our back yard when I noticed a USAF C-119 transport approaching Wright-Patterson AFB (10 miles away) from the east.  (I assume the aircraft was one from Lockbourne AFB near Columbus where an Air Force Reserve C-119 unit was based at the time.  C-119s were very common sights as a result.)  The aircraft was probably at 2000-3000 ft, flying at around 150 mph.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I watched I saw a brilliant light, quite small and very well defined, streak into view from overhead (approximately 30 degrees from the vertical from a southwestwardly direction) heading directly towards the transport.  For the next 15-20 seconds, the light darted around the C-119 at very high speed, performing sharp maneuvers flying above, below and around the aircraft.  The light then sped off in the same direction from which it came, although climbing at a significantly shallower angle than it arrived.  Within seconds it was out of sight.  Total time the light was in sight was less than 30 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> During the encounter, there was no sound other than the piston engines of the transport.   The C-119 did not appear to take any evasive action, meaning either the crew didn’t see the light or saw it so briefly they didn’t have time to react.   The C-119 continued towards WPAFB, where I assume it landed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I specifically remember watching the local news for the next few days, and reading the local newspapers to see if the incident was reported.  It was not uncommon for UFOs to be reported on TV and in the newspapers of the day, but no mention of the light I witnessed was reported by Dayton or Xenia media that I could find.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

No one wants to hear UFO stories from a child.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I can not remember the year, 1970 or 1971. I remember it being a warm day so it must have been late spring or summer. The sun was coming up and blue sky. I lived in the town of Chateauguay Quebec, Canada. I was on my way to my grand Parents apartment, they lived only I.5 miles from my home. It was a quiet morning, no traffic at all on the road, it was early, that much I remember. Perhaps 0600. I was riding my bike and I just turned down the street to my grand mothers place. There was a small open field to my left. Just then I had a strange feeling come over me, something said look up and there it was, about 100 feet or so in the sky was a plane or so I thought. It was over my right shoulder, I stopped for a second then rode my bike under the ship. It moved real slow, I was not scared at the time. I was not peddling either, just coasting along, and it floated like a balloon would. The color red sticks out in my mind and I don&#39;t know why. It was triangle shaped, more like a V or wing. Not really big, about the size of a jet fighter (plane). I saw lights underneath the craft. It happened so long ago I don&#39;t remember the details such as markings, engines, or glass. I know what I saw was real. The ship was so close to me I could have hit it with a rock. It finally dawned on me that there was no sound, no engine noise. All I remember hearing was a muffling sound. Like the noise your fridge or deep freeze would make. I still hear that sound now and then. I remember chasing after it but that&#39;s all I remember. I have been to Doctors and they can&#39;t find the source of the noise. I have seen Psychologist for years for panic and anxiety attacks. and my problem is I can not remember my childhood. bits and pieces and thats it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

8/15/71 06:00|New River (Guyana)||Disk|10 minutes|shiny object drawing up river water|8/28/02|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/023/S23213.html|8|ndxe197108| shiny object drawing up river water<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was 15 and on my August holidays from school and travelling with my father and 2 other men on a surveying trip to the interior of Guyana. We were in the New River / Courentyne River area across from Suriname. At dawn we were awake by the noise of all sorts of animals causing a commotion by the river. we rushed from the bushes to the river and saw a large silver saucer hoovering over the middle of the river. It appeared to be drawing up water in a upside down funnel shape into a iris-shaped opening in the underside. We watched it for about 10 min. then suddenly the water spout fell back down and the craft shot straight up until it disappeared. The others with me were my late father, ((name deleted)) - a surveyor, ((name deleted)), my uncle - a guide in the interior and a Amerindian local guide named ((deleted)). A few weeks later in the same general area, we chased a loud sound overhead in thick forest and managed to get glimpses through the thick vegetation of a shiny object that suddenly disapeared. Our Indian tracker couldn&#39;t identify footprints we saw on a sandy beach we came upon that had a fire burning on the sand. It was just flames in a ball that had no obvious souce of fuel. We threw water on the fire but it did not go out. Eventually, we looked around and left. Things we observed at the &#34;campsite&#34; were that something with three legs was over the ball of fire. There were some fruits on the beach with bite marks in them. Our Amerindian guide could not identify the friut as from around the area. We saw the bite marks as small with round teeth marks. Some of the foot prints appeared to been shoed and others, smaller child sized were barefooted. Nothing was unusual about the footprints, they seemed human but were spaced close as if the person had short legs for the size of foot. Other claw shaped footprints seemed to have been frolicking with the small prints at the waters edge. ((The guide)), an expert in forest wildlife could not identify the claw marks. None entered the water and there were no prints coming to or fr! om the s andy beach. It was as if they just dropped down on the sandy beach or jumped off something in the water. The area seems devoid of wildlife, most unusual, not even insects were around the beach. This existed for about 20 feet in a circle around the beach camp area. Then at the perimeter of the circle life teemed as usual. On our way back a few weeks later, we visited the area again and saw signs that there were fresh footprints, the fruits did not show signs of decay and the area was still devoid of life. At the edge of the perimeter area, we found the carcass of a jaguar. The back legs were outside the area and was decomposing and the rest of the carcass that laid inside the area was still fresh and even the blood from it&#39;s mouth was still liquid. Animal tracks in the sand of the beach area stooped abruptly at the perimeter of a circle that was about 20&#39; round.<n>

I DON&#39;T THINK THE WIND WAS BLOWING VERY HARD AT ALL. I WAS THROWING A BALL UP IN THE AIR AND CATCHING IT IN MY GLOVE. AS I THREW THE BALL UP, I SAW WHAT APPEARED AT FIRST GLANCE TO BE AN AIRPLANE. I ALLOWED THE BALL TO DROP WITHOUT TAKING MY EYES OFF THE &#34;PLANE&#34; BECAUSE I WAS AMAZED AT HOW FAST IT WAS MOVING. AT THE TIME, AND TO THIS DAY, I BELEIVED THE CRAFT TO HAVE BEEN FLYING AT LEAST AS HIGH AS A SMALL AIRPLANE WOULD FLY. WHEN I SAW IT, I WAS FACING ROUGHLY SOUTH. THE CRAFT FLEW WEST TO EAST AND WAS ALMOST DIRECTLY OVERHEAD AND AT ABOUT MY 2 O&#39;CLOCK POSITION WHEN I FIRST NOTICED IT. WHEN THE CRAFT REACHED ABOUT MY 11:00 POSITION, IT STOPPED ABRUPTLY, SPUN COMPLETELY AROUND ON IT&#39;S AXIS ONCE, AND FLEW OFF TO THE SOUTH ON PATH WHICH WAS AT A 90 DEGREE ANGLE TO IT&#39;S ORIGINAL FLIGHT PATH. I WAS STANDING ABOUT ONE HUNDRED YARDS FROM A HILL WITH TALL TREES ON IT. THE CRAFT FLEW FAR ABOVE THOSE TREES. IT DID NOT MAKE ANY SOUND.<n> <n><n> <n><n> IT APPEARED TO BE WHITE IN COLOR AND HAD NO MARKING ON IT. I DID NOT SEE ANY LIGHTS. IT DID NOT GLOW OR REFLECT THE SUNLIGHT. THE ONLY WAY I CAN DESCRIBE THE SPEED AT WHICH IT FLEW WOULD BE TO SAY THAT ONLY ONE TO TWO SECONDS ELAPSED BETWEEN THE TIME I FIRST NOTICED IT UNTIL IT WAS OUT OF SITE. WHEN IT STOPPED, IT DID SO WITHOUT SLOWING DOWN. IT JUST STOPPED AS THOUGH IT HAD HIT A WALL. WHEN IT SPUN, IT DID SO RAPIDLY, NOT IN A SLOW DELIBERATE MANNER.<n> <n><n> <n><n> THE CRAFT RESEMBLED AN AIRPLANE IN THAT IT HAD A FUSELAGE AND WINGS. THE MAIN WINGS AND THE WINGS AT THE TAIL WERE ALL WHERE THEY WOULD BE ON AN AIRPLANE, ACCEPT THAT THE FUSELAGE CONTINUED SLIGHTLY BEYOND THE TAIL WINGS. THE NOSE, ALL FOUR WINGS, AND THE TAIL WERE SQUARED OFF AT THEIR ENDS. THE MAIN WINGS IN THE CENTER OF THE FUSELAGE WERE SWEPT BACK ABOUT 45 DEGREES. THERE WAS A STEADY, EVEN WIDENING OF THE FUSELAGE FROM THE NOSE TOWARD THE TAIL. I HAD THE IMPRESSION THAT THE BOTTOM OF THE CRAFT WAS FLAT, NOT ROUNDED AS ON AN AIRPLANE.<n> <n><n> <n><n> WHEN I SAW THE CRAFT, I WAS AT MY HOME, WHICH WAS LOCATED ABOUT 30 MILES FROM STEWART AIRFEILD IN NEWBURG, NY. AT THE TIME, STEWART WAS AN AIRFORCE BASE, AND JETS OFTEN FLEW OVER ON A FLIGHT PATH SIMILAR TO THE ONE THE CRAFT I SAW WAS FLYING.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

The peak is named Verdi Peak and it is 10,900ft. msl.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What I thought were 3 white birds was the suns reflection off this UFO that was headed straight at us!  It came over Verdi peak and stopped and hovered approximately 150 ft. above an 200 ft. west of our position.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The craft had a mirror finish, no seams or rivets, no windows, no front or rear.  It made no engine or any other noise. The most amazing thing to us, was that the craft never changed its attitude in any way, aways remaining ridged in space like a gyro does. The craft was shaped like an cartoon cigar, like a foot ball.  It was so close, we all agreed that it was approximately 70ft. long and 40ft in diameter.  We all had the intense feeling that we were being &#34;check out&#34;!  IT scared the daylights out us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then things got even stranger, from a hover, the craft rose straight up until it had gained about 3000ft. of altitude from where it had been hovering, enough altitude to clear the mountain ridge and it flew north with a sudden burst of speed, the likes of which I have never seen, before or after the sighting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We could see the Jarbridge Mts, about 100 miles north, into Idaho from our vantage point on the mountain ridge.  We watched this craft go from right above us, to a little speck that disappeared over Idaho in about one and a half seconds!<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were pretty shaken up and all agreed to hike out of the mountains back to our car and go home.  It would take us a bit under a hour to get to the car.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When we arrived we all had noticed how low the sun was and that things were not adding up on the time we were gone and the time when we got to the car.  Only one of us had a wrist watch, and he had left it in the car. When he announced what the time was, we all were just dumbfounded!  We had 4 hours that we could not account for no matter how we tried to rationalize.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We had made the hike at least a dozen times over the years and knew how long it took. So we decited to never tell anyone about this.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I thought that it was time to speak up.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.
