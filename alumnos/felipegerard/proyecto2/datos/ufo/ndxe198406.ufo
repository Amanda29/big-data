It was huge and made no sound or reflection on the water below.|12/5/01|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/020/S20589.html|1|ndxe198406| We saw a sphere hovering at treetop level. It was huge and made no sound or reflection on the water below.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My boyfriend and I were driving home and were driving along a street where there was a pond behind the houses. We saw an extremely bright, white sphere hovering over the water. We couldn&#39;t understand what is was, so we continued down the street to a point where there weren&#39;t any houses. We literally stopped the car in the middle of the road, and got out. This gigantic white sphere hovered at treetop level. It made no sound, and didn&#39;t make a reflection on the water. Then suddenly, the light was gone, and then it almost instantly reappeared much farther away over Gulf Beach (on Long Island Sound) We drove down to that beach parking lot where other people were out of their cars looking at the same thing. It began to slowly move NE along the coast line. Many of us got in our cars and followed it along the beach line to Woodmont. Then all at once, it was gone.  I don&#39;t normally believe in this stuff, but I will never forget the chill that gave me. I was in disbelief. My boyfriend and I never told anyone about that incident.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Time and date may be approximate.  PD))<n>
6/30/84 21:30|Oakhill|TX|Circle|0005|Stationary  ball of bright light, changes color and moves rapidly across Texas night sky in 1984|1/10/09|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/067/S67738.html|2|ndxe198406| Stationary  ball of bright light, changes color and moves rapidly across Texas night sky in 1984<n> <n><n> <n><n> My wife and I lived just outside Austin, Texas at the time in a small area called &#39;Oakhill. We were headed off to see a 10pm movie in town and were sort of in a hurry to make it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As we came to a stop sign at HWY 290 to make a left turn towards Austin, I noticed a larger-than normal ranch light looming above the hill country/woods across the highway. I was staring at it, wondering why a ranch light was suspended so high up. My wife began asking me what I was looking at, and after I showed her, she calmly said.. &#39;What is it? I honestly didn&#39;t know. We kept looking at it which seemed for minutes, but no movement. I thought maybe it&#39;s a jet or plane on a extended flight path into Austin International coming straight at us with a landing light on or something making it appear to be stationary. Shortly, the Bright blueish-white ball or cicle of light began to fade down in intensity and sort of move slowly to the left ( East ) kind of parallel to our highway. Along the back of the circle were two blue rings one atop of the other. My wife and I had opened her moon-roof to try to hear better or get a better view while all of this was happening, but we never could hear any sound whatsoever. The night was a typical &#39;Texas evening to where you could have heard a pin drop. Not one sound, except for an occasional car passing out on the highway. No one else on the road stopped,slowed down, or appeared to notice what we were looking at.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My wife and I were not sleep deprived, drunken or under the influence of anything. We had only been in a hurry to get to a movie in town. As our object began moving, I started the car back up and took off in dirction of town as we both tried to keep track of it. With my wife and I both reasonably excited, &#39;her telling me to turn on my lights as well as to watch the road, the object shot fast for what appeared to be several miles, then turn at sharp angle, super fast again and then straight-up disappearing from sight. It all happened incredibly quick and within a few seco! nds if t hat. It was like watching an old episode of &#39;startrek when they would shoot off into space suddenly. It truly was the strangest-weirdest thing I had ever seen, and I&#39;ve seen a lot of stuff in my life. I had been in the Air Force as a crewchief on fighter jets and other planes and had never seen any aircraft/jet/plane etc.. to do what I saw. Also to note, I am a very-realistic person about things and have always been a sceptic of &#39;UFO&#39;s in general. My wife and I DID see this object as we&#39;ve told. That night, we both decided to forget the movie as we planned on seeing for as we were both excited/upset from what we saw. I was really thrown by the whole thing because I couldn&#39;t make sense of just what we saw. We drove back to our that night with me constantly asking my wife, &#39;Did you see that?, Did we really just see that??  I think she was more scared than anything, because she knew by looking at me that we saw something that wasn&#39;t right. After getting home, I did call the Police Dept. in town assuring them that this wasn&#39;t a prank or that we were not drunk or anything asking them if any one else had called about a strange light over the southwest Austin area, they said no, but it sounded interesting. Get this, they told me I might get a hold of the &#39;Air-force base or project blue book if it&#39;s still out  there. I assured them that it wasn&#39;t and told them that I worked on the Air force base( Bergstrom AFB at the time ) and didn&#39;t know of any numbers there to call. I thanked them for their time. Interestingly enough, when I called the Airport and spoke to a very-interested and nice person in the tower (APP-CON) they had asked me all the times and location of my event and then directed me to our local &#39;Travis-county sheriffs dept. The only traffic they (APP-CON) had noticed or had been with that night was a small cessna inbound over the Lake Travis area at around 9:15PM. After calling the &#39;Sheriffs dept and again ensuring them this was not a prank, they asked a few questions about the incident, like time/our ! location etc.. followed by, &#39;No we don&#39;t think your crazy or making it up, ten or so other people have called us as well about some strange lights over your area. The sheriffs deputy said we can send an officer over if you would like us to make out a report, it&#39;s up to you. He said, what ever we saw sounded interesting, and that they had a small incident reporting checklist he would use. My wife and I both agreed, and within a few minutes, a very nice-concerning officer appeared on our street and began looking at us both, asking questions. Before the officer left, he did say, &#39;Whatever you saw sounds pretty cool, you and a lot of other&#39;s seem to have saw the same thing tonight based upon what you guy&#39;s described to me. I have told a few folk&#39;s here and there about what happened that night, mainly not to forget that evening, but mostly to share a very &#39;real experience that happened to myself and another person. For many night&#39;s after that one evening, my wife would say what&#39;s wrong? as I would stand back looking out our windows. I would tell her that I felt really strange, &#39;Like I saw something that I shouldn&#39;t have and it&#39;s going to come back or something. I (We )have never seen anything since that evening.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date in 1984 is approximate.  We have assigned an arbitrary date.  PD))<n>

I had become a Christian in the traditional sense of accepting Jesus/God into my soul/heart.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was outdoors praying very, very intensely.  The most intensely I&#39;ve ever prayed.  Suddenly I heard a voice in my head say to look around behind me.  I turned and saw a large white brilliant light that was sparkling like a 100,000 glitter-sticks.  It was slowly moving, soundlessly, across the sky, above the tree-tops, and above my parent&#39;s house.  It was silent.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It suddenly just dissappeared. No noise, no smoke, nothing.  I did not see or hear anything after the incident.  It scared me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I walked quickly into the house.  I felt at the time that I&#39;d experienced a &#34;close encounter&#34; with an alien of some sort.  I was truly afraid.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I walked into my parent&#39;s house, went immediately to my mother&#39;s desk, and wrote a poem about titled, &#39;The Light.&#39;  I told others what I&#39;d seen.  Some were interested, some not, but the Youth Director at my church took the poem and sent it to some publishers.  I did not know he&#39;d done this until he approached me one day and said that he&#39;d done so and had two offers to print the poem.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was paid money for my permission.  One magazine printed the poem and illustrated a young man looking up into the sky at a brilliant light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Something of interest is that before I this incident, I&#39;d seen what looked like a very unusual &#34;shooting star,&#34; several times.  Each time I saw it, it seemed to be closer and closer to me.  It was quite unusual and got my attention.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;ve not seen the light again, but have seen other things, including an angel, or at least what I perceived as one.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am a mature adult, a medical professional, and I would have absolutely no reason to lie or joke about this.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date in the summer of 1984 is approximate.

I didn&#39;t know anything about ufo reporting until watching a ufo show on tv.  The Community was Glen Rose outside of Malvern.  I&#39;m not sure what time it was or day, it was night and I had taken my poodle, &#34;Cuddle&#39;s,&#34; outside to do his thing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Something drew my attention to what looked like a star, but watching it for I don&#39;t know how long, I realized the &#34;star&#34; was too close to the ground.   I continued watching, again I don&#39;t know how long I watched this; I went into the house and got my two daughters and my eldest daughter&#39;s boy friend to come outside and look at this thing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We stood on the porch again watching, what looked like a star, don&#39;t know how long we stood there, finallly I remember saying it was moving, then I thought it was a helicopter that was moving toward us.  Everything seemed slow.  The thing, was coming near, there was no sound, we watched as the object went almost directly over us, no sound, there was the white light at the front, with blue or green lights and it seems a red light somewhere, it has been so long ago to remember the details.  It was triangular shape. Ater this:  I read a book about UFO&#39;s and it had the triangular ufo&#39;s mentioned like we saw on this summer night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I wrote the author and to my surprise he wrote back, I had told the author I had these small encaved objects on my skin, like a doodle bug home, this was mentioned in his book.  The author told me he couldn&#39;t say if I had been abducted at some time but gave me some names of hypmotist in local states that I could see, he also said that this could be very tramautic to me, I decided not see anyone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I do still have the letter from the author but haven&#39;t searched for them yet, unless you would  like to see the documents.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The UFO came from the west.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The only witness not around is my daughter I lost in a car accident at the age of fifteen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

I was riding a Kawasaki 1000 motorcycle racing to work so I wouldn’t be late.  I was on disciplinary probation which meant I couldn’t be late or any other violation of company policy or I would be terminated other wise I would have stopped to investigate this oddity.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I passed the City of Adelanto, on Hwy 395, I accelerated to approximately 120 mph because I was running late and this speed would get me to work on time.  Shortly after leaving the city limits I saw a brilliant flashing light (Strobe) below the horizon off in the distance where I was heading.  At this point the sun had not risen but was just minutes away from rising.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was fixated on the flashing trying to figure out what it was.  It continued to flash with irregularly timed  pulses until I was about 2  miles or so away.  (Close enough so I was able to see it when it wasn’t flashing).<n> <n><n> <n><n> I slowed down to about 70 mph to try to figure out what it could be.  I stared intensely at the object as I was passing it.  It was now between me and the Eastern horizon.  The sky was bright and clear.  The object was perfectly round, appeared to be stationary, and was about 20-25 feet off the ground with a diameter of about 2’.  It was dull grey, seemed to be solid and reflected no light from the sun that was visible by then.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((name deleted))<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.

I have strange dreams of  very hightech information  thats ruining my life.<n> <n><n> <n><n> While driving to a meeting in Florence S.C. I happened to look to my left to the north  when I noticed a faint red object slowly moving over the treetops. I noticed the at equal segments there would be small flashes of lightning like light coming from the bottom of craft. I could not believe what I was seeing. I stopped my jeep on the side of the highway and got out of the jeep to get a better look. At this point I still could not believe it. I reached into the jeep and got my handheld floodlight and plugged it in the lighter I pointed it at the object and flashed it a couple of times at the craft and it stopped changed to a faint orange and it flashed three times and changed back to red . I flashed a few times more and the craft matched what I did. then the craft moved on heading west. So I got in the jeep crossed the median to follow it. All of a sudden it just took off straight up at super high speed. I stopped the jeep again got out to look all I could is several starlike objects moving in the western sky and they where gone. I could&#39;nt believe no other cars drove by during this time. So I drove on to Florence. When I got there everyone was angry with me and I could not understand why. then they asked me why was I almost four hours late. All I told them was I had car trouble. For all these years I never told anyone until I found your website. This is not the first time. Ever since this time I have memories of strange incidents simular to this, going all the way to my childhood.<n>
6/20/84 20:20|Holmwood|LA|Oval|25 minutes|Lake Charles native got a close up view of a large hovering disk on the hwy between Lake Charles and Bell City.|4/18/12|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/088/S88280.html|10|ndxe198406| Lake Charles native got a close up view of a large hovering disk on the hwy between Lake Charles and Bell City.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A friend and I were driving on Hwy 14 from Lake Charles LA, heading to Bell City LA to visit a friend for the evening. A few miles from Holmwood, LA; and after making one of the curves onto a long straight away, we saw a set of very bright lights appear about a mile or two in the distance. The lights were like two flood lights, side by side. They were close together similar to car headlights and were positioned off the right side of the road; they appeared to be about fifty feet or so in the air.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I commented that it looked like a car was sitting on top of a telephone pole with its bright headlights on. I started to slow the vehicle down as I got closer and closer to the lights. My friend and I began discussing and trying to figure out what they could be. I could not detect any movement from the lights, which led me to the early conclusion they must be on some kind of structure such as a light tower or possibly a new drilling rig that I had not noticed before. As we got closer and closer to their location, the lights looked more and more out of place and so I started slowing down so we could get a good look as we went by.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was traveling about 30 mph by the time we got to within 1000 ft of the lights. There was ample moonlight and so we began to be able to see that the lights were coming from a large oval shaped object that was sitting about twenty five feet off the right side of the road, and approximately forty feet in the air. We coasted past the object at about 15 mph with the windows open, looking directly up at it as we slowly passed by.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object was a bronze colored, metallic oval disc. It was maybe a little longer than a city bus, about thirty feet wide and probably about twenty feet thick. There was a series of lights that ran all the way around its circumference, and also on its underside that we could not see until we had cleared the bright frontal beams. My heart began thumping in my chest and my mind raced as I tried to comprehend what I was seeing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The realization hit me that I was looking at something beyond the scope of my understanding when I saw that there was no tower - or structure of any kind supporting this object in mid-air; nor was there anything above that the object that it could have been suspended from. This massive object that I was staring up at was just frozen in mid air. It wasn’t hovering like a helicopter or a jump jet, which can hover in one place in the air; those types of craft have a degree of movement that you can detect as they work to hold their place. This object looked as if it were being held in place. It was absolutely, completely, perfectly still. It appeared to be “at rest” in mid- air.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The most astonishing thing about it, which my mind could not reconcile and what made the object completely unexplainable to me was the fact that it did this in complete silence. I knew that we were looking at some type of craft, so the total lack of any sound defied logic and eliminated every propulsion system that I had ever heard of. I could not wrap my mind around how something so big, could hold so perfectly still without making so much as a whisper. I just kept asking myself; “why isn’t this thing making any noise?”  I was struck with a kind of fear I had never experienced before or since. I put the pedal to the floor and sped away.  My friend started yelling for me to stop because she wanted to get a better look at it; and after about a mile, I regained my composure and stopped in the car the middle of the highway. We both got out and stood there, looking back at the object which from behind, and because of the distance was just a hovering light off the side of the road. After about a minute the lights became bright and we realized that the object was moving toward us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We both jumped into the vehicle and took off fast. I accelerated up to about 90 mph but the object caught up to us quickly and pulled even with the car. The object matched our speed and shadowed us about 100 yards off of the right side of our vehicle. When I slowed down to make the big curve toward Bell City, the object crossed the highway behind us and pulled around the left side of our car, still 100 yards or so off the highway. It stayed right with us so I just continued at normal speed for the remaining 20 minutes of our trip.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When we arrived at our destination, we immediately got out of the car and stood in the driveway where we watched the object climb several thousand feet rapidly, and then pass directly overhead. We spent several minutes watching the skies but the object did not return.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of sighting is approximate.  PD))<n>

It looked sloped on the side of the direction it moved in. No windows or doors. It stuck me as very angular and similar to a very large garbage dumpster turned upside down. I watched it in silence for a at least 5 minutes before running inside and finding another cook.<n> <n><n> <n><n> He came outside and his reaction was: &#34;What the hell it that!&#34;  We both watched until we could no longer see it, scrathed our heads and went back to work.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting event is approximate.

At around 2300 hours I was working with my partner patroling the south west part of the city of Calgary. A call came in on the north west side of the city, which was in a separate district of the city in which we where working, however we shared the same radio channel. The call was that there was several unidentified object flying over the north west part of the city, at this time only a couple of calls had come in and my partner and I thought nothing of it at the time and the comments on the radio of the north west units on patrol, more orless joked about the call. But with in the next hour our communications section began to get a flood of calls coming into our main dispatch section of the same type of call, several unidentified craft in the northwest part of the sky, just sitting there.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At this time my partnerand I decided to check it out by driving to an open field on the south west part of the city which was elevated and had a good view of the city from the west. A north west car was dispatched to the call. Shortly upon our arrivial to our view piont, I along with my partner could see one object directly north of our position, placing it in the far west of the city&#39;s north end approx 3 miles north of us. A second object could be seen east of the first above the north centre of the city, this object was the same design of the first over the north west of the city. Both of these objects where hovering over the city, i would estamate at leat 1,500 feet above the ground and from our vantage piont we could see a bright white light in the centre of the craft and a blue light on top rotating in one direction as though it was mounted on the out side of a saucer and the saucer was spinning, there was a red light on the bottom this was a red light and moved in the opposite direction of the blue light that was mounted on the top. The blue light was mounted in the same way as the red light, as though it was on the end of a sauce.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Looking further east and north of the city another object could be similar, however this object was estamated to be at least 5 to 7 miles away. When we looked south of our location we could see another object identical to the first three objects and this one was directly in line with the north west object if your drew a line directly south of the north west object. The object was was approx 3 miles south of our location and appeared to be higher above the ground, i would est. to be 3,000 feet above the ground. There was a second object in the south west of the city which appeared to be inline with the second north object that was over the north centre of the city. All the object where of the same configuration.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Shortly after our arrivial, the unit in the north stated over the radio channel that a citizen had lent him a pair of binnocular&#39;s, and he stated that the craft was &#34;saucer shaped with blue light on the top and a red light on the bottom&#34;. The north west unit then turned on his over head emergencie equipment (patrolcar lights - red/blue). It was at this moment that we saw the object in the north west bounce up and down several time, faster than any craft that I have ever seen, dropping altatude aprrox 500 ft in seconds and bouncing back to its originial position.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Our communications section contacted the military base which wasin the city at the time, and two MP&#39;s in a vehicle attended our location. The airport was contacted by our communications personel and we where informed that the air port could not see any thing and had nothing on radar. The airport is located in the north east corner of the city and had a view of the entire city from the north east. Upon arrivial of the MP (military police) the witnesses the same objects. With in a short time the MP recieved a dispatch call from thier dispatcher saying that Spokan Washington had just been in touch with Ottawa and they said that they knew what the objects where and not to worry about them. After an hour at the site, the object in the south west part of the city began to move west bount, slowly at first then turned faster in a split second to a blurr as thoughit was traveling at warp speed and then it vanished.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The next day the story was debunked in the local news papers, saying that the objects where stars in the sky and not ufo&#39;s.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

I was 12 and spent my entire spring and summer evenings gazing at the stars...searching for anything unusual and exciting...I was disappointed night after night. Everything I saw was very easy to explain, until one evening...<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was gazing to my North (I could see the entire North sky midlevel and upward) in the mid area of the North sky I saw an object I thought must be another plane because I saw red lights that looked as if they were flashing. I took a look through my binoculars to find that it seemes to be red and green and yellow (maybe blue as well) lights changing colors, rotating, or spinning, it seemed to be in a ball shape. I still wasn&#39;t too impressed until it shot East across an enormous expanse of sky in a matter of seconds. It then came back to mid North then just as fast shot to the West and then back again then it made very fast movements straight up and then down and up and down like a bouncing ball. It continued to do these tricks for a long period of time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was able to convince my mother to come and look (so I would have proof and another witness) I was sure it would be gone when we returned to the backyard. But it was still there and she was able to witness all of the movements I mentioned before. We were both amazed at the speed and movements. In my opinion at the time and now is that it must have been moving at thousands of miles per hr. To look at it with the naked eye it seemed to be very high in the sky, possibly where an airliner would maintain a steady altitude.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I say, I know it was a long time ago, but I have never reported to anyone what I saw because I was just happy at the time that I wasn&#39;t the only one who saw it. I really didn&#39;t know who to call and now I am only reporting it because I still think it is extremely interesting and I found this website through a rerun of the Peter Jennings UFO special.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

There was NO SOUND from this object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It slowly came to the rear of the school and hovered over us for about 30 sec to a min, shining an unbelievable bright light, almost left no shadows, even at night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was at this point we noticed what we thought were American military jets scrambled to intercept this object.  These planes approached from the West.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The bright object drifted back to the South and then shot ahead of the jets, headed East, at a rate much faster than the planes, leaving them behind.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The  object made a very sharp turn that is not associated with plane movements.  There was no contact, no one was able to touch the object.  The object was silent but unmistakeable. We were left in shock and talked about it for the rest of the night!<n> <n><n> <n><n> SO:  One bright object: 2 planes?  But only the first object came close to us and bathed the area with light.  The other planes stayed far back as they attempted to close in on this object.  The distance from the object to the ground is unknown, possible a few hundred yards to a few hundred feet.  It was too bright to tell the distance or the exact shape.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Keep up the great work on C2C.<n> <n><n> <n><n> More details may pop into my head as I rethink this event, the group of friends I was with that night I&#39;ve not seen in quite some time.

I was staying with my uncle in a airbase named NODJEH near a village called Kabotarahangh.<n> <n><n> <n><n> One night me and my uncle were going home from his friends house and suddenly we saw something in the air that was so amazing that we couldn&#39;t believe it we saw.  And I am sure about this that we never talked about it not even once.  I mean when you see something unusuall you will at least tell your nearest friend about it, but something was denying us to do that, it just blocked up there.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I saw around me and there was at least 5 or 6 persons arround, but after the end of the show every one just went on their way.  Why?  I can not explain what I saw but I tell you I saw something.  It was as big as maybe the moon first but that thing got bigger and bigger in seconds, so big that I thought it would cover the whole sky.  But after some second it just disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I know!!  I have seen some stars.. no maybe some aircraft... or maybe just something created by light from other stars...<n> <n><n> <n><n> I don&#39;t know!!   But what ever you say, I am just sure about one thing.  That thing was real, huge and impossible.  I have never thought about this before, but ever since i saw this thing I feel strange.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I just had to tell some one about this...finally!<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

My father was on the back porch (a raised deck, perhaps 8-10 feet off the ground) listening to a baseball game; I remember that I was in the living room watching TV with my grandma.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At about 8:30 PM or so (it was getting dark) I heard dad call me from the back. He said &#34;Come here for a minute.&#34; I got up, annoyed (as only a teenager interrupted from the TV can be), and went the the back of the house. I stood at the screen door and asked what he wanted. I was told to come out of the door. As I came around the door and closed it behind me, my dad inclined his head and pointed toward the western horizon. &#34;What is that?&#34; he asked me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I turned to look, and what I saw were, as I recall, 5 small white lights closely clustered together, slowly moving west-east, toward us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> One of the lights was blinking. &#34;I&#39;ve been watching that for about 5 minutes,&#34; he said. &#34;I watched it come over the trees. Is that a plane or helicopter?&#34; I said that no, it sure didn&#39;t look like either a plane or a helicopter.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The lights were too close together, for one, and planes (and helicopters) usually have multicolored blinking lights; blue, red, white, etc. Besides, a plane flew past it (of course, it could have been miles away, but from our perspective, it passed close to the object), and we were able to compare the two. It was no plane.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We watched it for perhaps another 5 minutes or so, until it was nearly overhead, and as it disappeared behind the village&#39;s water tower that was two lots over from our house. We waited for it to come out from behind the water tower, which would have put it almost directly over our house at perhaps 1 o&#39;clock. It never did. We looked north, south, east and west, and saw no sign of it having come out from behind the tower. Not very exciting, but that&#39;s my UFO story.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of sighting is approximate.

(i used to sky-dive, road-race cars and motorcycles, and pilot airplanes, so i am a good judge of speed and distance.) the object passed in front of me (over the lake) at a distance of maybe 100 yards and an altitude of maybe 200 feet. it wa slowing continually during the descent. there was no sound. when it was at its closest, i could see through the glow and the object was shaped similarly to a diamond in a woman&#39;s engagement ring. (round when viewed from the top; near flat on top and expanding to a wider profile then tapering to a point in the side view) the color was varied from the blue of a royal crown cola can through to the color emitted by a blacklight. it disappeared behind the treeline maybe 100 yards down the shoreline. i stood there stunned for a couple of minutes and was getting ready to walk down the shoreline to see if i could see anything more when i noticed the movement of something coming through the woods. all i will say here about what happened over the next hour is that i communicated through telepathy (i didn&#39;t initiate the conversation and just had to think what i wanted to say.) with a blond-nordic. i did not go to the craft and didn&#39;t not see it except when it passed in front of me while descending and when it left. (it ascended in reverse of the way it descended.) there was no &#34;physical examination&#34;. i wa sober and was not tired. i am not subject to hallucinations. i have a measured i.q. that qualified me for membership in &#34;intertel&#34;. when i was in the military (1968-1971), i was a sergeant and worked as a fire distribution systems crewchief in aadcp&#39;s for nike-hercules missile defense syetems and had several ufo sightings on our radar systems both in the united states and korea. these were also seen by the members of my crews. my father and i also saw a cigar-shaped ufo over kansas in the summer of 1964 as we were flying one of the family planes from our home in iowa to the family ranch in oklahoma. my father also had a sighting in 1962 when he was driving from iowa to the family cabin in minnesota. he told me that he spotted something that landed in a field next to the road he was on. he said it was about 1/4 mile away from his car to the spot where it touched down. my father had a pilot&#39;s license from 1955 to when he passed away in 1973. he also built his own airplanes and was a groundcrew crewchief in the army air corps in morocco during the war.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Anonymous report.

As I was merging on to 81 I looked over my left shoulder to check the traffic as I did I caught something in my view about 1/4 of a mile down 81 south. As I was driving I kept looking ahead and looking back several times. It was about 100-200 feet in the air and seemed to be following the center of road.At first I thought it was one of the Apollo Space capsules that was being taken somewhere by helicopter but as I looked again I saw nothing above it or any cables to hooked to it .It was just spinning as if on a string while moving about the same speed of the traffic. Later on I was talking to a friend about what I had seen and much to my astonishment his sister and her friend had seen the same thing as I.   I would realy like your input on what I saw .<n>

I had awakened at 3:00 am or so, fully awake and walked to the living room and looked out across Lake Michigan from the four foot sliding glass door.  On the horizon I saw a light and thought it must have been on a ship out there. In 3 seconds it was about 100 ft. up, perhaps 20 t0 50 feet over the water from the shore. It must have had powerful type vision to know I was there. I didn&#39;t have the courage to go out on the deck, but wish i could have put an object out there to see if it would be picked up and taken into the ship or if they would have left something in its place.  After a fw minutes, it took off in a stunning arc, silently and rapidly over the roof and treetops and disapeared immediately.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

My name and my sisters {we are maternal twins}, from here on will be,mine-  s  hers-  d .This is what happened to her and I to the best we can recall .She and I where camping out at a friends trailer a few lots down. Around 2:30am My sister D got sick to her stomach and woke me up wanting to go home.I got up and we started walking home,about halfway.I noticed a dim spotlight on us coming from above.We both looked up. I saw a silver disk with lights circling around it.D saw A silver disk that was balled on the bottom .The disk was low about tree top level.D at that moment says she heard a robotic sound like talking but could not understand it.I heard a dull static like humming sound kind of like a TV sounds when it first kicks on .We both got scared and took off running to our trailers front door and began beating the door hard. No one answered,In the house where three people and one was a very light sleeper.No one woke up.So then we ran around to the other side.Our side yard was very close to Rickenbacker property.We then began beating on the light sleepers window.At that moment D says she heard a commotion coming from Rickenbacker men yelling truck motors running,racing.At that moment an apple fell out of our mid-sized apple tree in the yard.D and I turned around and looked up in the tree.This is what I saw in the tree.A very small man hunched, crotched down with his very long arms hanging out in front of him,his body was half in the light His color was bluish grey his legs where silky smooth like a womens and his hands where funny looking not sure why.I got the impression he meant us no harm and I got the impression we where interrupting  something.D saw this from her view point she saw a very small man in a gargoyle like stance with his long arms hanging out off his knees.D says his color was dark she did not see him in the light.D says his head was elongated in the back.That is all she can recall of him.We both saw him not move at all he was very motionless. Now we where freaking out we ran to the front again and this time D went to the corner of the deck and started crying.I beat on the door and started yelling for dad.This time  I could see him through the glass  He was asleep in his recliner and did not move.Then I remember nothing .D and I only remember waking up the next day in our beds.My mother recalls us talking about it but insisted we must have dreamt it all. If that is so then how come no one that night ever recalls letting us in the trailer.Also I have had a birth mark on my thigh all my life it was barely noticeable until that night.Even my mother says the next day is was much more plain to see.Also i have a weird creepy fear of black shark eyes or a bulls eyes.D has no such mark.D has no such fear.We are not insane we are very close twins and what happened was real. I just hope someone else can gain from what we are sharing here.We have no desire to recall anymore than we have.This has taking some courage to do and fear of being made fun of and laughed at has kept us quite till now.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

I was laying on the couch, and out our front window I saw something through the curtain sheers. I went to the window and observed a giant fireball roughly 50 feet in diameter moving very slowly in a horizontal direction. It was roughly 50 feet in my estimation  by comparing it to the 70 foot trailer across the road that it was nearly flying over.I could see all the flames. It was moving at my best guess about 5 mph. It didn&#39;t leave a fire trail, but the flames were vertical, and I could see it was sphere shaped. It moved about 10 feet over the tops of the trees and illuminated the tree tops as it went. I figured that if it had traveled in that same plane without raising or lowering, that it would have been a couple feet at most over our property in the back. We had a hill behind us that lowered to a creek bed in front of our house, that began another slight grade and then the tree line across the road. When I caught site of it, it was just passing over the hill in the front of our house, where it then moved over the trees across the road. I was 20 at the time, and was home alone. I got so scared that I ran upstairs and shut off all the lights. I didn&#39;t know what that thing was. I never even told my dad about it until about ten years later.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.  PD))<n>

We have requested that the witness attempt to reconstruct the exact date of the incident.  PD))<n> <n><n> <n><n> Observed bright light at close range, amasing movement, then hovered and my vehicle quit and lost all electrical system.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was 25 yrs. old at the time, married, 1 child, worked in the automotive field, licensed pilot. Was working late at the shop and upon heading home(12:30-1 a.m.) I stopped at intersection of hwy 91 leaving town. Intersection is on top of a hill or plateau w/ a small private airstrip directly across the highway. I glanced to my right before pulling onto the highway and noticed a single bright light approaching slowly from the east at approx. 1000 feet AGL. I first thought someone was possibly going to try to land as it was noticeably descending and it looked like a aircraft landing light. (I am a pilot and had a friend who had his airplane hangered there.) Thought it unusual as there are no runway lights. I waited thinking I would shine my headlights down the runway if he circled to land. The light crossed in front of me at about 300-400 feet AGL, I thought, this nut is going to try it. At the same time as it passed directly over the airport hangers, it drops instantly into the valley that drops off the plateau immediately west of the hangers. It went strait down to within a couple feet off the ground FAST and then flew west across the small valley at a speed several hundred mph in a zigzag pattern still hugging the ground. I sat open mouthed. At the other side of the valley was a stand of tall cottonwoods and it flew right up to them and then did another 90 degree strait up without slowing down to a height of probably 1500 feet AGL and went west a short distance and appeared to stop in midair. I sat for a minute astounded by what I had just witnessed, and then turned west on the highway still watching it sit there. (I lived two miles west on the highway) I drove to within 1/8th mile of my house and stopped on the side of highway when it appeared to be strait north of me approx. 3/4 mile. I got out of the car to get a better look at it and to see if I could hear any type of sound from it. It was silent, I thought about shutting off my engine to get complete silence, but decided it might be wiser to leave it running. I stood and watched it for several minutes, it never moved and I had an eerie feeling like it was watching me also. I remember I was lighting a cigarett! e when s uddenly my car QUIT!! Didn&#39;t miss or stumble, just quit like I shut off the key. Goose bumps rushed over me as I was a mechanic by trade and that car NEVER, EVER quit before since new. I looked down into the car and there were no dashlights, no digital clock, engine/oil lights...nothing! I reached in and pulled the headlight switch on...nothing. I knew the battery was only 2 mo&#39;s old (multimiles best 5 yr. batt.) and I thought this can&#39;t be happening to me. I walked to the front of the car and the light was still sitting there motionless. Scared/angry, I yelled at it not to even Think about it! and began walking toward my house 1/8 mile away. I reached home and still it never moved, went in the house, sat in the chair and chain smoked two cigarettes while watching it out the window, never moved so I went to bed. I awoke about 4 a.m., got up, looked out the window and it was gone. Got up next morning, I walked back to my car, thinking, this will tell the story, actually hoping it wouldn&#39;t start, proving that it was just coincidence, got in it, stuck the keys in the ignition and turned them...lights, buzzers, everything...tried starting it, it started instantly, I shut it off and it started instantly again. I never could make out any shape of the craft or whatever it was, just a steady bright white light, didn&#39;t pulsate or change colors or anything like that. It should be noted that for a year or so before that and after that, there were cattle mutilations being reported in central Nebraska.  Don&#39;t know if there is any connection. Later that summer I personaly witnessed one about 4 miles west of my house. A white charlia cow, a &#34;perfect&#34; 4-5 inch hole where they removed the sexual organs in the rear, and a perfect 4-5&#34; hole in its chest in front where they removed the heart. The cow was still sitting in it&#39;s sleeping position with it&#39;s head curled around as if it was still sleeping. It never awoke or moved, no sign of any struggle, no blood anywhere! Not on it or near it. None! several other people saw it also, along with Greeley co. sheriff. There were no tracks of any kind around it, happened on a saturday nite/sunday morning. My sister also had a light follow her for 10-15 miles home late one night down two different highways. If you have any questions, I would be happy to answer them.<n>

We just stood staring at it for at least 20 minutes, I think we said a few things about what it could not have been and decided it must be a UFO, after about 20 minutes I told her to go and get her mom and I would watch the object.  It remained in the same place making no noise as it had been the entire time, when I heard the back door realizing they coming out I yelled it was there while turning towards thier direction and as I turned back towards the object it was gone.  No noise and no evidence it had even been there.  My sister in law and I tried to explain to my mother in law what we had seen and she tried to explain it away.  My sister in law and I discussed it in private many times after that and knew it could not have been a plane for many reasons, the lights were all wrong in color and a plane could not have held the same position for that period of time, not to mention the closeness to the tree, a helicoptor would defeinately have way to much noise and not have the lights.  These lights were bright red, yellow, and green.  The brighness of the lights are what held our amazement for so long.  We did not discuss this with many people after because we thought people would send us to the nut house.  It did happen!!!!<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.  PD))<n>
6/1/84 23:00|Los Angeles|CA|Circle|about 10 minutes|Watched for about ten minutes a small balloon-shaped object that seemed to maneuver over a parking lot|2/27/00|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/012/S12118.html|33|ndxe198406| Watched for about ten minutes a small balloon-shaped object that seemed to maneuver over a parking lot<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was working on the seventh or eighth floor of an office building just off Wilshire Boulevard.  My desk was next to a large window that overlooked a large parking lot down below.  It was clear and sunny outside.  I was about to go to lunch, and, while standing to stretch, instinctively looked out the window.  My attention was immediately drawn to what looked like a silver balloon-type object &#34;maneuvering&#34; over the parking lot.  In fact, I would have dismissed it as a balloon had its movements not struck me as rather peculiar after watching it for a couple of minutes.  Rather than be whipped around as a balloon typically would be in a breeze or wind, it moved slowly around the cars and would occasionally seem to &#34;hover&#34; in a spot for a minute or so before slowly moving on. By now most of my co-workers had left for lunch, but I managed to get the attention of a man who was walking by my area and asked him to take a look and tell me if he saw the same thing I was looking at!  He also saw it and agreed that its movements were unusual for a balloon.  I made it a point to see if anybody else was in the parking lot who might be observing the balloon up close and personal, but there was no one.  While I considered the incident strange even as I experienced it, it obviously was not enough to make me go tearing to the elevator and out into the parking lot to get a better look (the other witness, as far as I know, didn&#39;t check it out further either).  I went to lunch at a place in the building and when I returned to my desk and looked out the window, the object was gone.  I never quite forgot over the years, however, what I have come to label my &#34;intelligent balloon&#34; and wonder if anybody else has had a similar experience, especially in the middle of the big city.<n>

We kept going toward Horse shoe lake and just as we got about the middle of Horse shoe lake suddenly there was a big hot red ball of fire coming down on the other side of the lake, as it neared the Earth it broke into three pieces and went down on the other side of the lake.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My girl friend realy freeked out but I allready knew about alien space craft from my experience in the army.I was catching a military hop from Ft. Polk, La when a Airforce Pilot sat down beside me, He threw me a half inch thick book and ask me if I wanted some good reading. I looked at the book and inside a red square were these words TOP SECRET OFFICIAL US AIRFORCE FILES ON UFO&#34;S. I told him that I couldn&#39;t read it because it was marked top secret, He said go ahead their giving them to all the new pilots to prepare them for what they might see.So I began reading it and it realy blew my little country boy mind there were hundreds of pictures of UFO&#39;s of every discription. And with the pictures were complete follow up reports. One picture was of a old house the jets took one picture at 10,000 feet and another at 20,000 feet, it had a chimney and a front porch and every thing.The followup report said it just kept going right out of radar range.another was a huge disc shaped craft hovering over a high power line and like streaks of lightning going up from the power lines to the craft, the follow up report said the metering station reported missing 80,000 watts of electricy.There were cigar shaped ones triangle shaped ones many disc shaped ones, all kinds.There were interveiws with people who had seen aliens and of those that had been abducted and discriptions of alliens and pictures people had drawn of aliens.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I promise you that as hard as it is to believe every word is true, I know the Government knows about alien space craft they just don&#39;t want the people to know so they cover it up.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thanks: ((name deleted))<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

6/1/84 21:00|Perry (rural highway, S.R.22)|OH|Other|5-10min.|Two polygonal cylinders hovering near S.R. 22 communicating with strobes|8/19/00|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/013/S13739.html|36|ndxe198406| Two polygonal cylinders hovering near S.R. 22 communicating with strobes<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was driving from work to somerset, ohio to meet with friends.  It was approximately  2110hrs.  I was south-west bound on sr22.  Just as I approached the perry/muskingum border, I noticed an unusual object in the north sky at a very low altitude.  I pulled my car off the highway and shut it off.  As I climbed out of the car, I noticed that it was even closer than I had thought.  In my estimation, it was approximately 500&#39; north of my position and 250&#39; in altitude.  The craft was completely soundless.  It was shaped like an octagonal or hexagonal cylinder.  It was dull metallic in color maybe the color of titanium or aluminum.  There were no windows or doors, the only distinguishable feature on the outside was a small dome on the bottom west-facing end of the craft.  There is a road across the sr from my position and several times during the sighting I wanted to try to get someone&#39;s attention, but terror, fascination, and the fear of it disappearing before I got back prevented me.  As I continued to watch, the dome on what I assumed to be the front of the craft(west-facing end), began to strobe.  After a few minutes or seconds, things begin to get unclear here due to the huge amounts of adrenaline pumping through my body, but another craft approached from the west.  It stopped abruptly at approximately the same altitude and a couple of hunderd feet to the west of the first.  This craft was not shaped exactly the same as the first, but it was similar.   The only thing I remember for certain about the second craft was the presence of the same type of dome on the east facing end which also began to strobe.  This contunued for a few seconds, I would guess, and then they both began to drift north as if they were connected.  I watched until they drifted out of sight.  As the fear began to subside, I realized what an amazing event had just unfolded before me.   The entire time this event took place, not one car passed which may not be that significant considering the fact that this is not a busy highway even ! during t he day.  I just wanted someone else to see it.  I am not saying that this was a craft from another galaxy, planet, or dimension, what I am saying is that I saw what I described, exactly as I described it.  The sky was still bright enough to see plainly.  For all I know, this could be some type of secret government aircraft, but it was unlike anything I had ever seen before or since.<n>

First object  continued west.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At the time of this sighting, I lived South of Brookley Field, an old Air Force base shut down in the 60&#39;s, now a commercial industrial park with a still active airport. I believe it was late spring or early summer in the mid 1980&#39;s (possibly 1984-1985). It was shortly after 5:00 p.m. on a bright cloudless evening. The sun was in the west and the sky was still blue. I saw a shiny metallic object about the size of a lower-case &#34;o&#34; flying east to west, north of my location. At the time, I was relatively knowledgeable about many different types of aircraft. Brookley Field was and is still an active airport, and there were military airshows held there occasionally. The first thing I noticed was the object appeared to be reflecting the light of the sun, it did not appear to be producing it&#39;s own light. There was no contrail. It was travelling steadily due west. I first assumed it was a high-flying airplane. It then, without slowing down, stopped in mid air. I thought it may have been a helocopter, but it was higher in the sky than I had ever seen one before. I moved over to where I could see the object and a tree for purposes of verifying that it had indeed become stationary and to use the tree for a reference point. While I was observing the object, another object appeared to come from the first object. This object was slightly smaller than the first, and it moved off in a southwesterly direction from the first object. It was similar in appearance to the first, shiny metallic in color. it seemed to go from a dead stop to a steady pace with no transition speed noticed. There was no contrail, or smoke behind this object either. I observed this object until it was out of sight to the southwest. The first object then continued on to the west, again going from stopped to its previous speed without any transition. It continued due west until it was out of site.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

6/1/84 13:00|Elmendorf AFB|AK|Diamond|15 minutes|Observed red-diamond-shaped object with C-90 telescope on tripod.  Object was motionless at an altitude of approximatiely One Thousand|2/16/00|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/011/S11777.html|45|ndxe198406| Observed red-diamond-shaped object with C-90 telescope on tripod.  Object was motionless at an altitude of approximatiely One Thousand feet (1,000 ft.) and over the ordinance impact area north of the ground-wave listening antenna. A dark square, longer than it was wide, was centered in the diamond, and resembling a tinted-picture window.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was sitting by my second-story dormitory window with the window open.  The dormitory was near cherry hill on Elmendorf AFB.  The sky was clear.  It wasn&#39;t uncommon for me to observe sky conditions; because, I was a weather observer for the U.S.A.F.  I remember I was sitting very close to the window, and as I turned to my left I noticed a red speck in the sky.  My attention was drawn completely to the speck, and in order to satisfy my curiosity I grabbed my celestron (C-90) telescope and placed a 35X Barlow in the tube. Needless to say, there was a perfectly motionless red diamond floating in the sky, over the ordinance-impact area, north of the ground-wave-listening antenna, perfectly motionless, and at an altitude of about One Thousand feet (1,000 ft.). My initial reaction was to telephone the tower.  Instead though, I went next door to a rather merry gathering of my fellow workers and brought their attention to bear on the object.  Then we observed the object at a higher power - high enough to see it was a red diamond shaped object with a dark square longer than it was wide, and centered in the middle. Nothing accompanied the event such as sound or lights etc. emitted by the object. All of us looked at each other in amazement.  Our decision was that it might be a kite.  Since there was a party going on we decided not to notify anyone.  Also I think we were having trouble admitting to ourselves the reality of the situation. The sighting went unreported until now.<n>
6/1/84 13:00|Bowling Green|KY|Unknown|20 - Minutes|SOMETHING AIRBORNE HIT & DAMAGED OUR U-HAUL|2/1/07|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/054/S54080.html|46|ndxe198406| SOMETHING AIRBORNE HIT &amp; DAMAGED OUR U-HAUL<n> <n><n> <n><n> My story is a very strange one, and I have not told many people about this.  We decided to keep quiet about this incident back then because of being fired, or people thinking that we were responsible in some way - as will be explained.  They may have thought that we were seeing things or drinking, but we were doing neither.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As far as seeing a UFO or such, we didn&#39;t.  Yet, my co-worker and I did encounter something very strange and unexplainable indeed.  This is a TRUE story, and my previous co-worker can verify my story if he ever decided to come forward.  I still to this day cannot understand what happened to us that day back in 1984 etc.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The day began as I was working for Wal-Mart in Bowling Green, Kentucky.  The day was clear, warm, and beautiful.  It was a busy time of the year, and we were using U-Haul rental trucks to transport merchandise from our warehouse to our main store.<n> <n><n> <n><n> One day my co-worker and I were again sent out to get some more merchandise from our warehouse sometime after noon.  The warehouse was located across town from where our main store was located - about seven miles.  I was driving a large U-Haul truck, and was driving carefully.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Everything was going well until we came to the four-way intersection on the Nashville Road from Campbell Lane.  I stopped at the intersection red light, and then proceeded to turn right onto the Nashville Road.  We pulled up a bit and proceeded to drive the short distance left to our destination when something really powerful and large hit our U-Haul.  Whatever it was hit us so hard it literally made us jerk sideways, and it made a loud metal crashing noise.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After gathering our senses I put on the flashing emergency red lights and we got out to see what had happened.  We both thought that somebody had hit us in the back end of our truck.  Yet, when we looked around there was not any vehicle anywhere that had hit us - nothing.   We would have seen a vehicle pass us while we were inside the truck, but this was not the case either.  Nobody else (traffic) seemed to have seen anyone hit us, or anything unusual, either.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Now confused and puzzled, we decided to look for damage to the U-Haul, and this is where the real strangeness comes to play.  When we went to the right passenger side of the truck there was some severe damage to the truck, but it was near the very &#34;TOP&#34; side of the vehicle.  My co-worker and I were completely stunned and speechless.   A severe dent about eight feet long and two feet deep was plainly visable on the truck near the top.  This was the passenger side that no traffic at all could have been near to because there was no road there - just a school yard.  Whatever had hit the upper part of the U-Haul had to have been airborne!<n> <n><n> <n><n> The damage to the truck was extensive, highly visable, and not there when we had began our trip that afternoon.  The truck was checked before we had left the store.  Whatever hit the truck had to have been airborne, and very big and slanted to make a deep dent like that.  The damaged looked like what a disk would make if it hit metal.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We didn&#39;t know what to do, and feared that we would be held liable for the damage.  We feared for our jobs too.  After all, who would possibly believe such a story as this?  How could we logically explain this?<n> <n><n> <n><n> After a while of talking we both decided to keep quiet about this because we felt we had to.  Nothing was ever mentioned to us about the damaged U-Haul either when we got back to our store, and we felt that was odd, too.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I can tell you absolutely that somthing very large, airborne, and powerful struck our U-Haul truck that day.   Whatever it was had to have been flying at tree-top level and grazed our truck.  Yet, we never saw the craft or whatever it was.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This story is absolutely true and accurate.  I have no idea of how to give you any kind of sensible explaination for this.  We were attacked or hit by something strange though.  Strange stuff!<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thank you for your website and interest.  I do not wish to reveal my identity at this time ---- BLC<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

6/1/84 13:00|Mississauga (Canada)|ON|Disk|1 miniute|Incredibly close sighting in broad daylight.|12/2/00|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/011/S11224.html|47|ndxe198406| Incredibly close sighting in broad daylight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am not sure of the year although it was sometime in the early 80&#39;s. I wish I had reported this then or made notes. Maybe this is the time? We were at a friends apartment in Mississauga near the QEW and Erin Mills Parkway. It was summer time in the afternoon. The skies were blue with little or no clouds. The apartment was fairly high up. 7-10 floors facing north. I was inside when my friends start to yell. I ran to the balcony. Standing on the balcony looking north, the Credit River to our right, runs from Lake Ontario behind us, north. In the distance we can see Erindale University. There Credit River forms a natural green belt. Not more than 2km&#39;s to our right, hovering slowly and quietly south down the Credit River about 500m above the ground was a saucer or disk shaped object (craft). There were no lights. I remember distinctly that it looked weathered. Rusty, brown, black. It looked like it had been exposed to the elements. I would estimate that it would have been 200m from end to end. Fairly low profile compared to the size.  The craft continued to slowly hover south for approximately 45 seconds. It was hard to tell if it was spinning. It then stop for 15 seconds. It rose instantly about 500-1000m straight up. Stop briefly then appeared to take off south and vanish again silently. I do not believe any of my friends that were there that day ever reported their sightings. I looked for other reports in the papers for a couple of weeks, but never read or heard of another sighting of this object. This experience has effected the way that I live my life.

One photo out of the many in succession stood out.  It was taken at Epcot Center in Orlando, Florida.  There appears to be an object in the photo that was not in any other photos.  It is a small dark object that was not noticed until just recently that seem to have appeared and disappeared as fast as one photo to the next.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
6/1/84 12:00|Colfax|WA|Oval|5 minutes|Sighting near Colfax, WA in the mid 80's and another in the Alpine Lakes Wilderness|8/16/02|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/024/S24106.html|49|ndxe198406| Sighting near Colfax, WA in the mid 80&#39;s and another in the Alpine Lakes Wilderness<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had left Washington State University in Pullman, WA enroute to my parents in Tacoma. I was heading northwest out of Colfax up to Sprague Lake where I was going to get on I-90.  About midway there I looked up and seen a large airplane traving north. I could not tell if it was a passenger or cargo plane, but it was not a small plane(not a private prop or company yet). It was your typical large airplane, what else can I say. Anyway, there was also a large dark oval or egg shaped &#34;spot&#34; following on the airplanes left flank. It was a very dark object with no distinct characteristics other than it was oval like, very dark and seemed to have no real distinct boundary. Quite small compared to the airplane... not much longer that the width of the wing - I would guess about the size of my pickup truck. I would say it was within 20 feet or so of the fusilage (sp?) of the airplane - traveling parallel with it - following it. I was driving at the time and taking glances up from the road as often as I could and started to slow down. I am thinking, &#34;this has got to be a figment of my imagination&#34;. I pulled over quickly and got out and looked up and the dark object was then directly in front of the plane - both traveling in the same direction and at the same speed. Both still heading north. I was thinking at the time that it had to be a visual anomalie and starting rubbing my eyes, etc and looking around in the skies for similar anomalies. I am out there in the sagebrush desert, no one else on the road, just starring up at this event in amazement. About then I noticed two military jets coming from the east (probably the airbase at Spokane).  I am thinking &#34;if they are coming on behalf of that airliner, man, this is something to be witnessing&#34;. Sure enough. The jets were moving fast and when they got within, say, a mile or so, the dark object just took off. Very, very, very fast is all I can say. There was a &#34;wake&#34; in the blue part of the sky - a dark path almost like a parting of the atmosphere directly in front of! the air liner. The UFO was there one minute and the next minute it was gone. Both military fighers came up and paralleled the airliner for a short distance and then left. And that was it. The airliner was a bit north of me by then. But I still remember that &#39;vapor trail&#39; or dark path through the atmosphere. It slowly &#34;filled in&#34; or otherwise turned the normal sky blue.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Another time, I was up in the Alpine Lakes Wilderness near French Ridge. Miles from any highway. At least two mountains between me and I-90 and 9 miles from the dirt road that I drove up. I set up camp near a small creek before Turquoise Lake. Was woken up that night by a humming sound. Never seen anything, but the humming got louder the softer then louder... etc in a cycle that lasted all night.  I am thinking, I am in the heart of a wilderness area at least 8 miles from the road. 4&#39;000 feet of elevation gain by trail and backpack. What the hell could be &#39;humming up here&#39;. Definitely a big machinery like sound. And very large though it seemed to be at least a quarter mile from me.  I could not tell which direction only that it was somewhere in that basin. I was pretty worried camping out there (was backpacking solo on that trip). Got up in the morning and looked around. Not much for trees up there as I was just at or above timerline. I hiked and looked around the basin that morning but could find nothing. This also happened in the mid 80&#39;s.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Never mentioned either event before as I certainly have no respect for a government that hides such things. Don&#39;t want anything to do with them or talk with them. I figure it has been long enough now that they wouldn&#39;t bother. Too damn many other folks and sightings and such.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

It made a high-pitched whining noise with two tones, maybe an octave or two apart. It seemed to me to be no more than maybe 50-100 feet overhead.  It moved rather slowly and quite majestically.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At the time I had assumed it was a weather monitor or some such.  There is an Air Force base in Tampa, so I supposed it was something to do with that, however, the unusual alphabetical characters makes me wonder what it actually was.  It seemed to be rather small, at most half the size of a Volkswagen bug.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;m curious to know if anyone knows what it was.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thank you.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date is approximate.

6/1/84 00:00|Perth (Western Australia)|||20 Minutes|I encountered three small grey creatures and a rolling ball of light while walking at a near by lake.|7/1/02|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/023/S23548.html|51|ndxe198406| I encountered three small grey creatures and a rolling ball of light while walking at a near by lake.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was the night of a full moon and I had taken my dog for a midnight walk to a nearby lake reserve, and had walked some distance along the lake side under the gum trees. From this point the reserve opened into a clearing. I had planned to cross this clearing but saw some figures in the distance moving towards me. They were some distance off and I thought they must be three or four boys, judging from their hieght. I also observed a white object that was moving, wich I presumed to be a white pair of jeans reflecting the moon light as the figures moved. As I was a lone female out walking on a reserve very late at night, I thought it prudent to wait quietly in the dark near the trees until these boys had passed on there way.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I crouched there with my dog and watched them approach, I slowly became aware that the figures I had thought were children were actually small humanoids who&#39;s arms and legs seemed to be too long for their bodies. They moved with a strange gait and seemed to be unclothed with dark greyish skin (although this was difficult to disern in the moonlight). As I watched in amazement and horror the boucing white object revealed itself as a rolling ball of light trailing behind the three pint size people. At this point my dog began barking and growling at them and was obviously terrified! The figures who had been walking in single file, followed by the rolling ball of light stopped in their tracks. The leader lifted his strange long arm high in the air and let out a spine tingling cry, and at this point my dog bolted with her tail between her legs, leaving me to fend for myself. After watching my dog disert me the creatures duplicated my dogs behaviour and they dissappeared into a thicket of very high wild lupins not far off! This experience was followed up the following night when my cousin, on hearing of my encounter, some how persuaded me to return to the lake with him, armed with a camera. We did not meet anymore strange figures but were buzzed by a large craft of white light which hoverd several times over the clearing.  My cousin took photographs of the light but I wasn&#39;t so eager to rush out into the clearing. The strangest thing about the whole episode was that although I was naturally terrified, I believe these creatures were even more terrified of me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

6/1/84|Huntsville|AL|Sphere||Unidentified Sphere|10/28/02|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/025/S25555.html|54|ndxe198406| Unidentified Sphere<n> <n><n> <n><n> Description:  Metallic sphere weighing approx. fifty-two (52) pounds with a circumference of thirty-two (32) inches.  It has what appears to be a removable disk, or plate, that measures six and one halve (6 1/2) inches across containing eight (8) small threaded holes and a larger threaded hole in the center.  I have never attempted to remove this part.  It has a gray metallic coating resembling a very hard Teflon like material.  Because of it&#39;s weight I assumed that it was constructed of steel, but was surprised to discover that it is not attracted to a magnet.<n> <n><n> <n><n> History:  The object was found in the woods of North Alabama in the mid 1980s.  It appeared to have fallen a great distance as it was embedded in the ground (red clay) with only a small portion visible.  Soon after it&#39;s discovery, I contacted the U.S. Army at Redstone Arsenal in Huntsville, AL and gave them a description of the ball and my name, address and phone number.  I was told that someone would contact me, but never heard from anyone.  I then called NASA and gave them the same description and contact information.  Never heard from them.  I later called the Huntsville Police Bomb Squad division and was visited by two officers just minutes after calling.  After inspection they told me that it was probably secretly manufactured by the government as it had no markings of origin.  They had seen other stuff in the past including circuit boards with no markings that turned out to be such.  I asked them if they thought it could be alien.  They both had a big laugh and explained that this was impossible as it contained screws.... as if screws could only be a human invention!!  They wanted my permission to take it with them, but I decided against it as they explained that they were going to destroy it. (Their policy was to destroy any thing that they could not identify!).  Anyway, I have had this thing ever since and have never found an explanation.  Many people have seen it (I kept it on my desk as a conversation piece for years.) and have offered a few theories:  A simple weight, Time Capsule, Device used for tracking purposes, part of an aircraft and etc.  Some even believe that it may be of alien construction!<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We suspect that the object is not UFO-related, but we would be interested to know what the object is.  We will encourage the owner to measure the threads on the machine screws, in order to establish whether they are a metric or English thrread.  PD))<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((FOLLOW-UP COMMUNICATION))<n> <n><n> <n><n> Dear Mr. Davenport:<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thank you so much for your interest and reply.<n> <n><n> <n><n> First, to answer your question... Each of the screw holes, including the center hole does not admit a view of the interior.  The center hole terminates in the plate itself, while the other eight bores through two layers.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have not attempted to remove the &#34;Door&#34; of the Sphere.  I think mostly out of paranoia of the unknown content.  Could it possibly be radioactive, or maybe booby trapped with an explosive?  This &#34;Thing&#34; has never been x-rayed or monitored for any sort of emissions.  I would rather leave this to professionals.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have noticed, though, that it appears to have a hollow space.  If you strike the side with a hard object, it responds with a &#34;ping&#34;.  Striking the side opposite the &#34;Door&#34; results in a thud.  This also leads me to believe that it&#39;s far too intricate to be a simple weight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thanks again<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((END FOLLOW-UP))<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((FOLLOW-UP))<n> <n><n> <n><n> Hello<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thanks again for your interest.  Please feel free to use any correspondence that may help unfold this mystery.  I am eager to learn the origin of this &#34;Thing&#34; and very curios as to it&#39;s content.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have no clue of the type of metal the sphere is made of.  I can tell you that it has no magnetic draw.  This surprised me considering it&#39;s weight.  Obviously it is not steel.  There are a few places where the coating has been scratched.  These happened over the years that it was in my possession.  It was absolutely pristine when it was discovered and sustained no damage whatsoever from it&#39;s fall from the sky.  It was found embedded in red clay (the consistency of modeling clay).  So, it had a &#34;soft&#34; landing as opposed to hitting rocks or gravel, etc.  Most of the existing scars were produced by hammer blows or other hard objects.  Once a friend actually slammed it onto his concrete drive way in attempt to crack it open.  The only result was a cracked driveway!<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have not had access to any Geiger counters or x-ray devices, but I will try the Film trick.  Thanks for that bit of advise.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Sincerely,<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((END))<n>
6/1/84|Huntsville|AL|Sphere||Follow up on sphere found near Huntsvill, AL|10/28/02|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/025/S25821.html|55|ndxe198406| Follow up on sphere found near Huntsvill, AL<n> <n><n> <n><n> Just wanted to give some info reference your unknown sphere reported 10/13/02.  I am a Bomb Disposal Techniciation with the US Army and can say that the item in the photograph doesn&#39;t look like explosive ordnance but may be a sub section of a piece of ordnance, possably a gas bottle generator from a rocket, and may contain explosive componants.  (PLEASE BE NICE TO THE ITEM).  Due to the location the item found I would consider it military in nature, and possibly experimental.<n> <n><n> <n><n> One question I have is, can you detect a filler in the item? does it slosh like it&#39;s filled with fluid? or an uneven weight on any side of the item? Please don&#39;t open the item untill positive i.d. can be made.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What I would suggest is to contact the US Army EOD unit at Redstone and they will X-ray the item, You will have to contact your local law enforcement and have them actually call the Army EOD unit because we don&#39;t respond off post unless called by civilian law enforcement.<n>
