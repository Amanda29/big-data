Venus, I found out later, was about 30 degree&#39;s off the horizon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was this light coming from north to south at a steady speed and a very straight line.  It did not leave a trail or anything of that sort.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It went straight to Venus and stopped.  It stayed there for two or three seconds.  It then went around the lower part of Venus to the other side, 180 degree&#39;s from the first stop.  It was there two or three seconds, then continured on a southerly line.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then my father called me in...<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((name and e-address deleted))<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.
