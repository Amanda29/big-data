Closes again and leaves no sign of exi|1/28/99|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/002/S02337.html|8|ndxe199511| Summary : Hole (50 feet by 30 feet) opens up on hill side.  Light streams from it along with motor noise.  Closes again and leaves no sign of existence.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The following event has been something I have kept quiet about for almost one and  a half years.  It was not until I read an account on this site about a UFO sighting east of my area on 11-27-95 that I realized it might be UFO related.The  phenomena occurred on the night of 11-27-95.  At that period my wife and I would often walk around the hills of our small mountain town during the evening.   It was near 8 PM when we were ascending up a small gulch to the NE of our town.  I happened to look up the east hill slope and saw a large black area.  At that moment a light came on  in the area: it was a large hole in the ground about 50 feet long and maybe 30 feet wide.  It was slightly above us and about 170 feet away.   There was for a short time the sound of a motor, like that of an air-compressor.  The sound was a steady ‘puut puut puut puut’ like a one cylinder engine.  The light illuminated the sides of the hole (actually it was very bright) and we saw the fresh surface of broken rock around the hole&#39;s sides.  As we continued to ascend the gulch I told my wife that it was probably the site of a new house being built.  I figured that it was a hole for a basement.  The light was bluish-white like that seen in !the older mercury vapor lights.  The motor sound only lasted a minute and once the light went off only come on again.  I assumed that the owner was in the hole doing work.  Other than wondering how such a hole was dug into solid sandstone I gave no special thought to the event.  I almost decided to walk over and look in but decided not to since the owner might not want me on his land.  We ended up seeing the hole from several heights (both from below and slightly above) and several angles as we walked on towards home.  Several months passed.  On 3-10-96 it was a fine Spring morning and my wife and I decided to go up and see how the new house was coming along.  As we topped the rise above the small gulch all that met our eyes was a smooth hillside covered with old weeds and grass with a few small stones.  Nothing appeared to have been moved for decades!  As a child I had read about such things, but that type of phenomena was one kind that I had refused to believe possible.<n>

As we stood outside, we saw three red lights in a &#34;v&#34; formation, followed by 5-7 greenish-white lights moving in a fluid, wavy motion.  The closest analogy I can think of is a tadpole or a sperm.<n> <n><n> <n><n> *  *  .  * .<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> Red=* Light green = .<n> <n><n> <n><n> The red lights were about the size and brightness of Venus as it appears to the naked eye.  The trailing lights were smaller.<n> <n><n> <n><n> An airplane was in the sky concurrently, and though the mysterious lights looked further away than those of the plane, they were moving much, much faster.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Also, their motion didn&#39;t seem like anything we&#39;d ever seen before.  Rather than moving as though propelled by a motive force coming from a fixed place ( ie a jet or prop ) , these lights seemed to change direction instantaneously.  They were also capable of hovering in place, then jumping to an incredible rate of speed, and always in formation.  I still remember it clearly because I&#39;ve never really seen anything move like that in my life -- particularly an aircraft.  It reminded me of how a hummingbird hovers, then darts.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When the lights flew over us, they again picked up speed in their jerky-but-fluid way, startling my companion and causing him to fall in a hedge beside the house.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Anyway, that&#39;s it.  It was weird.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Image provided by witness in the text of his report did not survive the transfer to the database and website.

It appeared to be facing me, but turning in a clockwise direction. I couldn&#39;t tell if it was flying on it&#39;s side or if I was just seeing one side of a multi-dimensional object, and it&#39;s edges appeared rounded instead of sharp. It was light blue, almost white on the outer edges of it but had a darker blue glow to it until it turned to black in the middle. It may have been very big but I couldn&#39;t tell its distance from where I was. It was pretty low because I could still see the road and fields when staring straight at it, so I don&#39;t know if it was very large yet far away or smaller and closer to me. It wasn&#39;t going too fast because I got a good look at it and then it went out of my view accross the windshield (I was driving). I then just continued driving when something caught my eye to the right and I looked out the passenger window where I saw the object continuing it&#39;s path in an eastward direction over the fields. There was snow on the ground but it was such a clear crisp night and I should have stopped and at least woke one eyewitness but it all happened so quickly and I had 2 more hours of driving to do.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

No visible horizon, no moon.  Up in the sky were three bright lights.  Initially I was thinking it was a military aircraft.  The lights were spaces as if there were a nose light, and two under the wings lights, near the wheel wells, as per military aircraft design.  Then one of the lights went out. Leaving two lights.  I thought how odd.  Normally in military aircraft, the pilot cannot extinquish say the nose light.  Then another light went off, leaving just one bright light.  I thought, wow this is really odd, how are they pulling this one off.  If the plane was in a turn, it could possibly explain the lighting, but there were no red port lights or green starboard lights.  There were no anti-collision lights present. Then the single light went out, leaving complete darkeness.  As a former military pilot, I just thought this whole episode odd.  Later it was rumored to me that there is a secret military base located in that part of Oregon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A year later I ran into a gentleman and his twelve year old son.  They were staying at the Lakeside Motel in eastern Oregon near Christmas Valley.  He said it was around two in the morning and he and his girlfriend&#39;s son went out to retrieve the boy&#39;s shoe from their truck.  When he walked outside, he noticed that there were no stars in the sky.  On more careful observation, he saw a large craft passing two hunderd feet above him, moving at approximatly 40 mph.  When the aircraft passed, and the stars reappeared, he said it was the classical red/green/blue lights circling around the aircraft.  He said the object was 3/4 of a mile large. The next morning during check out, he asked the Manager of the Motel if they had ever seen UFO&#39;s around. The manager responded, &#34;We don&#39;t talk about those kinds of things around here&#34;  A year later a friend was visting.  He was traveling through the Van Deuozor r corridor which is a stretch of forest between Lincoln City on the Oregon coast and Salem Oregon.  He said he and his friends saw a large trianglur shaped object traveling above the tree line.  I tried to trick my friend and say how big was it about 40 feet long.  He responded, &#34;Are you kidding try more like a half a mile&#34;<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

The object did not twinkle as one would expect if it were a star.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At approximately 0515 my wife and I were driving SSE on Pondrosa St. and at appromixmately 35 degres to the horizon she and I saw an object as discribed above flying in a NNE to SSW direction.It was flying on a 90 degres with the horizon. Ten seconds went by and the object made an abrupt 35 to 40 degre downward turn.. Take a pencil and draw a streight line for a time and then an abrupt turn downward 30 or 40 degres. This what my wife and I saw. I know of nothing that cand move like that. I would conclude that the object was VERT high in altitude. We compared the speed of a jet liner that normally flies at say 30 thousand feet to the speed of this object and figured it was very large and high in altitude. The object was traveling 15 times the speed of a jet airliner if you observe the jet at 30 thousand feet. The objest disappeared over the horizon.

My father, mother, and I had just gotten home about 1:00 am from an auction.  My parents went to bed and I stayed up to watch TV.  I noticed a bright light outside our front door.  I went to the door and looked out expecting to see a patrol car making rounds, or something to that nature.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What I saw was absolutely amazing.  I will try to be as precise as possible.  The craft was about 200 feet in the air above the field and an adjacent house.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The shape was circular and rotating.  I immediately called my mother in to see the object.  She was speechless.  There was no noise.  There were several lights, however, it was more of an ambient light that what you would expect from a flying craft.  It was not the beam lights from any sort of spotlight.  The craft was at least the size of a football field and was not completely smooth.  There appeared to be several points on the underbelly and even one that lo! oked like a platform.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As we observed it rotating, we called for my dad.  The rear, or what I assume was the rear, came into view as we called for him.  It was different from the rest of the craft.  It was square shaped, and had three large white lights that changed to red.  At that point my mother and I both turned to yell at my dad again.  When we turned back, it was gone.  Just 1-2 seconds that we turned away it disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I can remember this encounter like it was yesterday.

It was motionless and totally silent. It had a light at each corner and the beam came from the center. It was approx. 40&#39; x 25&#39;. After I got out it started moving west at about 5 mph. We followed until it descended behind a ridge out of sight about a half mile away. The neighbors had cattle out back. -((deleted)) Administrator<n> <n><n> <n><n> I also work as the founder and administrator of ((deleted)) , a satellite and high altitude survey and mapping oriented organization that provides information about new technology for discovering natural resources and minerals, surveying, guides, and related issues  ((URL deleted)) . I&#39;ll take any test to prove the validity of my observation. My family is highly respected in the community as honest and truthful. On one Saturday evening just after dark  The black, arrowhead-shaped ufo was hoovering silently as it casted a cone-shaped beam into the neighbors back yard. We couldn&#39;t see what it was shinning on as it was behind the crest of the high-ground behind the house where the cattle were kept. I got out of the car which was stopped in the middle of the road and looked over the roof at the ufo in astonishment. It was completely silent. It had a light at each corner underneath and the beam came from the bottom center of the craft. Apparently, we were spotted too, and the ufo turned the beam off. Then it proceed at a low speed (approx. 5 mph) to the west. We were observing the ufo eastward from Davis Ridge Road at first. It came almost directly over us. It was about 80&#39; off of the ground. It continued west and we turned the car around and followed. The road ran north and south though, and b! y the time we were heading west coming off the ridge we saw it descend below a ridge to the west of us. We saw it no more. The whole affair lasted about 15 minutes. Everyone in the car saw it. We all had gotten out to see it before we jumped back in to pursue it. I got the impression that the occupants of the craft could care less if we saw it that night, as it seemed to be in no hurry for the most part.<n>

The closer to her property she got, the more alarmed she became that the objects were near, or above, her property.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Just at the moment she pulled off the highway to go up her driveway, she witnessed an immense flash, that illuminated the countryside with white light.  At the same instant as the flash, she saw a streak of light shoot across the sky.

The neighbor had seen the flash, and the both of them stood outside and looked at &#34;red and blue flashing&#34; lights in several points of the sky.  (Note:  Were those lights twinkling stars??)<n>

We were driving westbound to exit the beach after fishing that night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My companion yelled for me to stop and pointed out the object.  The exhaust was 3 colors. red, then surrounded by blue, surrounded by white.  Appeared to be jet-propulsion.  This made the slow speed impossible.no faster than 80-90 knots.(est)<n> <n><n> <n><n> After about one min. the object turned and accelerated until it dissappeared.  No bank angle or rate of turn was apparent.Just an instant directional change.  The angle of turn appeared about 140 degress. since the object was headed due east over long island, the approx angle of travel and turn was discernable by well known landmarks.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My companion and myself were at that time, radar air traffic controllers at the NY approach control (15 years)in westbury, NY, and both with former US Navy ATC experiance(4 years).  Speed and altitude  judgements and relative velocity and turn angles at night were  and are part of our daily work in ATC both in Tower and Radar work.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Since the Lufthansa405 departure from JFK would reach the spot they reported the sighting in roughly 15-18 mins,(east of HTO VOR)assuming an ontime departure, which would be common on a typical sat night in NY (low traffic volume) and Lufthansa 405 is a Merit or  WAVY departure (SID out of NY to Europe) the timeline makes perfect sense.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I report this now after all these years because I only recently stumble upon the LH405 PIREP (pilot report) and wanted to confirm his sighting and the BAW266 report.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I hope this has been helpful.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

I lived in a house that is in a field, but surrounded by woods, it is the highest point in the town.  On a clear night it is absolutely beautiful, you can see everything in the sky, including all flight paths of planes crossing over you.  There was one person in the room with me, and my younger sisters were asleep in their room.  She exclaimed to me &#34;What is that out there over the trees?!?&#34;  The forest started maybe 1/4 mile away from the back of the house.  I looked and I figured it was just a really bright star, but then I realized I had never seen that star in that position in the sky ever.  I thought this was really odd because my family and I would lay outside and look at the stars all of the time.  I got a pair of binaculars to get a better picture of it and I saw that it wasn&#39;t just one light, like a star, it was two lights very close together, it looked like the headlights of a car.  It sat there for maybe 2 or 3 minutes, and then all of sudden it became just one light instead of two.  I sat there and watched it with this other person, who I might add firmly did not believe in aliens or UFO&#39;s, for another couple of seconds.  Suddenly, the light went straight up into the air and hoovered at this new height for another 10 or 15 seconds.  I started to run around my house, turning off all lights, TV, everything electrical that was on.  In my mind somehow I think I was afraid that if it sensed electricity or something coming from my house it would try to land, seeing that my house was the only house in the middle of this big field.  I had never experienced any thing like this, I didn&#39;t know what to do.  At this point in time all we could see of it was this &#34;headlight.&#34;  Then, it starts moving across the field in the direction of my house.  There was absolutely no noise coming from it, there was just complete silence outside.  I was standing out in the open on my back porch so that way I could clearly se! e what i t was doing; I was terrified.  It continued to move very slowly across the field, I am not sure how high it was off the ground though.  It finally crossed over the corner of my house, about 100ft. above me.  It was a circular or oval type shape, I could see a red dim outline of the craft, like it had red lights all the bottom if it. It was still completely silent.  It moved over my house and kept moving across the field, but to the left now heading towards the trees on the left of my house.  I ran to the big windows on that side of my house and saw it go over the trees.  All I could see of it now was the faint red glow.  It went up over the trees, it raised straight up again and then I could not see it any more.  The other person and I did not know what to do.  We knew that we should call somebody or report it but we didn&#39;t know who to call.  She called our local police station, they didn&#39;t really say anything.  I told my father the next day about what had happened and he confided in my that he had seen &#34;things&#34; out there at night before too, but nothing that close to the house or the ground.  That was the end of it.  I have not seen anything like that since then, I do not live there anymore, but my family still does and as far as I know nothing like that has happend again.  At the time I was 16 years old, and the other witness was about 24 or 25.  I have always thought that it was extremely possible for these things to happen, but like I had mentioned before the other witness totally did not believe in aliens or UFO&#39;s or anything like that.  After this incident she does and is totally convinced that what we saw was a UFO&gt;<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date in November 1995 is approximate.

I mentioned to the person on the phone that I had seen a shooting star. Three seconds had passed and then two more green dots That were flying directly side by side flew along the same flight pattern . the last two lights flew on either side of the first one . the approximate alltitude was probably 50,000 ft.<n>
11/15/95 22:00|La Puente|CA|Other|15 seconds|Four large luminous disks arranged like the engines of a 4-engine plane flew north to south at low altitude and silently.|8/5/01|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/017/S17797.html|67|ndxe199511| Four large luminous disks arranged like the engines of a 4-engine plane flew north to south at low altitude and silently.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The date and time may be very inaccurate; the incident occurred several years ago here, where we&#39;ve lived for 10 years, perhaps in November, since we were looking for meteors at the time of one of the showers.  I didn&#39;t report it at the time, thinking that, somehow, it must be an airplane, but since then I&#39;ve described it to several aviators and never found one who could make sense of it.  I&#39;m less interested in getting it into the record than in hearing a plausible explanation, if there is one, so I will accept a collect call.  In case my wife or a child doesn&#39;t understand the call, and refuses, please try again.  I&#39;m at home evenings. My wife and two of my children saw the object as much as I did, but my wife is not a native speaker, while my children remember the incident but very little about it.  We were sitting in the back yard.  The sky was clear, except a small cloud formation in the north.  The object flew in a straight line from north to south, at low altitude, apparently, and it was absolutely silent.  I&#39;m hard of hearing, but wife and kids said that it made no sound that they could detect.  What we actually saw was four large luminous disks, all the same size, with an appearance similar to fluorescent lamps behind circular plastic shields.  They were quite bright but not dazzling.  Each was a good deal larger than the full moon.  They were facing downward.  They were in a formation as if they were in the same positions as the engines on a 4-engine airplane with a somewhat swept-back wing, and the distance from the leftmost disk to the rightmost was about the distance from tip of thumb to tip of little finger if the hand is held at arm&#39;s length with fingers spread as much as possible.  We did not see a wing, body, or anything other than the disks, and I figured this was because we didn&#39;t have the time or presence of mind to see them, but I saw two of the disks shift slightly and quickly relative to each other - wife and kids said later that they didn&#39;t see that.  This &#34;airplane&#34; flew at a go! od clip from north to south, about what I&#39;d expect of a 4-engine airplane at that altitude; I should say, &#34;all deliberate speed.&#34;  There were no navigation lights, landing lights, or anything of that nature.  I am sure it wasn&#39;t a blimp or dirigible, and I can&#39;t see it being a glider, since I have trouble believing that a glider could fly with large disks under its wings, and I&#39;d think such a stunt would be extremely dangerous at night, even if it could fly.  Besides, I&#39;ve never seen a glider around here.  I really would appreciate it if you could offer me an explanation for what we saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

And I swear that all that I will tell you is based on what I saw and only the truth. Okay,<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;m a Filipino and I&#39;m 22 yrs. old right now. I was born on September 08, 1985 and I am definitely sure that I saw this UFO when I was 10 yrs. old because I did promised to my self that I will remember my age and the date at that time as I saw that UFO.  But I can&#39;t recall the exact date, all I remember was the month. November to December.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We where playing hide and seek with my cousin and my friends (they are also my neighbors) at my friends house near a road, and at the other side of the road is a bench with 3 men drinking beer (which where also my neighbors,) the environment at that time was dark ‘cause you know here in Philippines not all of people are rich. As I am running and finding my way to hide near the road, the man with beer at the bench shouted UFO. UFO was popular at that time (1993 – 1994) here in Philippines ‘cause it was the time that they really appear or what we call the invasion.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I look up at the sky I saw the perfect circle with blue ring light under it and in that blue light is a much powerful blue light rotating clockwise, and why did I recognize the shape so easily? Because the blue ring light was like an aura. The UFO was about a little higher than a TV network Tower and it’s moving very slowly diagonally to south east. It was like a size of a small coin from what we’ve seen from the ground when you hold a small coin (1 cent coin). As I had seen it followed with goosebumps. I ran as fast as I could to our house. It was so dark at that time, instead I sit under a small tree and shout call my mom many times as I look again at the night sky it’s still there the movement was change to North East. And as my Mom called me and as I will show and tell It to her, ‘cause you will still be able to see it from our house. It was totally gone. It happened around P.M.8:! 00 to P.<n> <n><n> <n><n> M.9:00. Because P.M. 9:00 was our sleeping time at that time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

There was no sound Its path was from ESE to WNW. It disappeared beyond some buildings that were across the river form my vantage point. I told a co-worker that I thought that I had just seen a plane about to crash. However, it didn&#39;t look like a plane, and  there never were news reports about the object. If anyone else recalls having seen what I saw, I would really like to know.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date in November 1995 is approximate.

I went outside and saw an object that had 7 red lights that was in the form of a triangle.  There were no flashing lights and I heard absolutely no noise coming from the craft. The object was moving in a southern direction very slowly.  I got in my car and drove over to the Triple Stop Gas Station and watched the object continue to move south into Davis County.  I informed some of my co-workers about what I saw.  The next day in the Ogden Standard Examiner Newspaper it was reported that a number of people saw this object and called the Ogden Airport.  According to the Newspaper the Airport Staff reported this object was a comet.  A statement which I and I am sure all others who saw the object would dispute for it was moving to slow and was clearly not a comet.<n>

I remember a couple of days before seeing the object, I had trouble sleeping, and was having wierd dreams. In my back yard, we have a drainage Ditch,and behind the ditch at that time, we had several thousand acres of farm land. My backyard faces the West, and beyond the farm land runs the highway enter- ing Brownsville,from North to South. I remember that a couple of nights before, while being outside at night, I would see a ball of white light on the other side of the ditch.  I could recall seeing the light barely over the brush along the ditch, but for some strange reason I didn&#39;t think about it. I remember seeing it several times, and it did stand out, but for some reason I didn&#39;t check it out. But then on that night, I Decided to take my dog,(a Great Dane) for a walk, I would walk her probably every other night that month, late at night. It was a cool night, and it was clear skies, I walked to the back yard, when again I saw this light, It apeared to be moving slowly up and down. This time I became aware of how this light was strange, and out of place. The light at that moment looked like a street light, I went to the ditch for a better look, as I got closer, I could not see it, because of the brush.  The Ditch on the other side is higher than the side I was standing on, so I was trying to figure out how I could get a better view.  As I stood there, this bright light shot up from where I had seen the light, It was the size of a golf ball at arms lenth,this is the best I could describe it.  It seemed to be rotating, and changing colors, It was not very bright, as bright as a 40 watt light bulb.  You could see like vapor, like when you look at gasoline, is the best way I could describe it, you could see the colors change as it rotated, I can&#39;t remember though which way it was rotating(sorry), but it was rotating horizontally. My dog also noticed it, she was scared but did not bark, She had her tail between her legs. I stood there for about 15 seconds, trying to figure out what it was, but then I became scared, And I ran inside the house thru the front door, with the dog. I remember telling my self, that no one was going to believe me about what I saw, So I ran into the bedroom and woke my wife up, I dragged her outside thru the sliding door going to my back yard. My wife didn&#39;t know what was going on, I guess I was pretty excited, but she saw it also, but this time, it was starting to move to the Northwest slowly. It seemed to be shrinking in size, It got to the size of a pea at arms lenth. I had built a elivated platform for my son, so I climbed it, and watched it, as it dropped behind some trees in the far distance Northwest of my home. At the time I didn&#39;t believe in ufo&#39;s, I was just a regular Joe, Didn&#39;t really give it to much thought, but now I have become a strong believer. Thank You, PS My wife was 6 months pregnant at the time<n>

In November of 1995 I left work about 8 p.m.  I had to stop over at my parents house and decided to take a &#34;back road&#34; because it was quicker, the road is 7 miles of uninhabited state land, it is a winding dirt road, I had traveled it many times before and was very familiar with the road and terrain next to it.  The night was overcast so there were no stars or moon visible, about 2-3 miles down the road I came around a sharp bend and saw an object hovering above the treetops straight ahead (where the road takes another sharp bend).  At first I was confused about what I was looking at, it didn&#39;t make sense what I was seeing.  I stopped the car and put it in park, and rolled down my window, I heard absolutely nothing, the craft was about 50 ft down the road from me, It had 4 rows of orange or amber lights, and it had a whitish-green mist around the it, the bottom of the craft lit up the branches of the trees it was hovering over, the lights around the rim were NOT pulsating or changing colors, they remained constant and didn&#39;t seem to shine very brightly.  About this time I completely freaked out! I didn&#39;t feel I had time to turn the car around so I threw the car into park and gunned it, I went straight towards the craft and hoped to hell it wouldn&#39;t start following me or shine a light on my car, (I had heard the stories), Good God it was terrifying.  When I got just about under it I had to brake to make the corner and I remember glancing up, I don&#39;t recall exactly what I saw, but I do remember a small bright &#34;neon&#34; green light somewhere on the bottom of the craft, I drove like a bat-out-of-hell until I got to my parents house, I could hardly walk into the house my legs where so weak, and as soon as I saw my mom I started bawling like a baby, She didn&#39;t really know what to say when I told her what happened.  And to this day my family gets uncomfortable if! I bring it up. After that experience I had terrible nightmares, I&#39;m not saying I was &#34;abducted&#34; but the nightmares were along that line. and I would have panic attacks when I drove at night, especially since I live in a rural area. Well I could write more, but I think this will do.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; date is approximate.

At t|8/30/99|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/008/S08650.html|90|ndxe199511| While driving on Route 1&amp;9 in Elizabeth Near Newark Airport I was looking at an airplane that was taking off on an upward incline. At this time I spotted a white silvery oval shape that appeared to shoot out at a downward angle from the bottom of the plane. It went down then it stopped and shot upward then suddenly shot in the opposite direction at an unbelievable rate of speed.  then disappeared into the clouds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I belive the date is correct but I am not positive, If I find out otherwise I will write back. I am a Police Officer In Union County New Jersey. My Uncle who lives in Omaha NE was visiting and he needed a ride to the airport. I had the day off from work already so I decided that I would drive him to the airport. On my way home from the airport I was getting off of Route 1&amp;9 and heading on to North Ave East right by where Dowd ave meets Division street in Elizabeth NJ(Hardly a stones throw from the Newark airport property)while stopped at a red light I looked to my left and saw a large airplane taking off on an incline going in a southwest direction. This was the same direction that I was facing. Then I saw a whiteish silveryish oval craft coming at a downward angle it looked as if it was something that fell off of the plane at first. The light turned green and I was in the middle of lots of traffic so I managed to pull my pick up truck up onto the curb and on to the grass. I stopped and continued to watch as the object fell then stopped in mid-air. It stayed put for a few seconds as the plane flew farther away. Then the object began to rise straight up and a few more seconds later it took off at an incredible rate of speed that was just breath taking. It shot up into the clouds and after that point I could no longer see the object but I stayed there looking up as many cars passed by looking at me as a sat there dazed staring up at the sky. There were some clouds but the rest of the sky was blue and clear. I don&#39;t know what else to include in this report. This is all that I can remember of that day. It was an incredible experience though.<n>
11/8/95 19:00|Pilot Rock|OR|Light|1 hour|Two brothers witness cluster of 4 bizarre blue-white lights ahead on highway.  Strange effects. Drove 98.7 miles on 2 gal. gas.|11/2/99|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/000/S00957.html|91|ndxe199511| Two brothers were returning to Pendleton, OR, and Dixie, WA, after hunting in Oregon.  Upon approaching Pilot Rock, OR, the brother driving the lead vehicle, a Suzuki (Samurai?) noticed a peculiar cluster of blue-white colored round lights, positioned in a square or rectangular pattern, ahead.  He called his brother on CB radio (Ch. 4) to ask is he saw it, and the brother answered that he certainly did.  The lights disappeared from sight, then reappeared on the other side of the road.  They passed through Pilot Rock, and the object became visible again as they were leaving that town.  The object had the same appearance as it had had before they arrived at Pilot Rock, and it stayed with them (according to their conscious recollection, for another 30 minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The brothers made several interesting observations at the time of the incident.  Most interesting was the fact that even though they were talking over a CB channel that traditionally is used very heavily by loggers, and other users in that area of Oregon (Ch. 4), they heard no other users during the entire experience!  Also, they saw no other traffic on their side of the highway,. even though they remember seeing oncoming traffic in the other lane.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When they got home, they topped off the fuel tanks in their trucks.  Craig&#39;s vehicle indicated that he had driven 98.7 miles from deer camp, where both he and his brother had filled their vehicles&#39; fuel tanks from fuel cans.  When they got to Pendleton, his vehicle, which was getting about 25 miles per gallon, took less than 2 gallons of fuel!<n> <n><n> <n><n> Craig had spent 9 years in the military, during which time, he said, he had seen many different types of weapons used.  This aerial event, or object, was like nothing he had ever seen before, he said.<n>

The size of the object was hard to estimate but it appeared to be very low when it passed over our house whithout making any sound. If the object was at a high altitude then it was gigantic in size, but I would guess it was only about 100 feet over the house and if this guess is correct then it was about half a football field in size.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was a clear night with a lot of stars visable so as this object passed over it blocked out the stars between the 3 points of light at it&#39;s 3 corners.

At the very instant that it made contact with the ground a brilliant upside down pyramid of light - the same color as the sphere - shown into the sky.  The light coming from the ground or impact was gone in a flash.  There was no sound associated with this event. I looked around hoping to see that someone else had witnessed this event, checked the newspaper the next day for a report and also tried to phone the local UFO hotline (it was not a working number).

Three of my friends were riding in my car; one in the passenger seat was awake and two others in the back were asleep.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I noticed a light in the sky straight ahead of me at a distance of what I guessed was about 10-15 miles.  At first, I thought it was the light atop the Palm Springs Aerial Tramway, until I realized that it was on the opposite side of the mountains from where it should be.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I continued to watch the light, and over the next few minutes I noticed that it seemed to be pulsating, going from dim to bright and back again every 10 seconds or so.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I kept driving, I noticed a couple more things.  First, the light didn&#39;t seem to be getting closer to us on its own. Second, it wasn&#39;t changing altitude.  At this point, I remarked to my friend in the passenger seat about it and asked if he could see it, and he confirmed that he did. I told him I thought it looked like the landing lights of an airliner headed in our direction, but we both agreed that couldn&#39;t be the case since there is no airport in the direction it would have been headed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We continued to watch the light as we got closer to it, and it continued its slow pulsating, staying in the same position at the same altitude.  At this point, it was nearing 4:30 in the morning and there were several other cars on the freeway.  My friend and I had started to openly ask what it could be at this point, running through possibilities such as a helicopter or blimp.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We got even closer and could tell it was something highly unusual. It was hovering above an area just beyond where the freeway split off to Highway 111, which was the route we needed to take to get home to Palm Springs. The area it was over is next to a rest stop off of Interstate 10, which at the time was brightly illuminated.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As we reached the start of the turn-off for Highway 111, we could see three distinct lights facing us from the object which were pale blue in color.  They seemed to have stopped pulsating by this point but didn&#39;t illuminate the object itself. It was, as I&#39;ve come to say over the years, &#34;stuck&#34; in the air.  It was only a few hundred feet off the ground at most and utterly still.  More than anything, it was the absolute stillness with which it hung in the air that convinced my friend and I that this was not a normal aircraft.  It was as if it was somehow &amp;quot;disconnected&amp;quot; from gravity.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We&#39;d slowed to about 10 miles an hour as we took the off-ramp and had rolled down the windows.  My friend had his head out the passenger side window and I was craning my neck to push my face against the windshield and look up at the object.  We didn&#39;t hear any sound, other than the air rushing past the car.  At this point, the object began to move very slowly across the highway directly above us.  I could clearly see three pale blue lights in a triangle formation, seemingly at the &amp;quot;tips&amp;quot; of the object, and one slightly larger pale blue light at what I assumed was its center.  The sky was clear and full of stars, so while I couldn&#39;t see the hull of the object, I could see that it was blocking the stars above it and appeared to be a solid triangle about 150 feet on each side from light to light.  The lights on it did not illuminate the skin of its hull, however.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I kept driving and we passed underneath it. My friend watched it out of the passenger side window and then said, &#34;It&#39;s gone.&#34;  The entire sighting, from when I first noticed the light to when the object passed overhead, lasted approximately 30 minutes.  During that time, I can only imagine that dozens of cars must have passed near it, since it was hovering right next to the freeway.  I&#39;ve always been sort of amazed by this, especially when I&#39;d begin to consider that perhaps it was a military test craft.  For something you wouldn&#39;t think someone would want seen, it was sitting only a few hundred feet in the air next to a fairly busy freeway.  My friend has remarked that he couldn&#39;t imagine a military vehicle utilizing a technology as exotic as anti-gravity being operated near a populated area, for fear that an accident could potentially harm a large number of people, given the sort of power source something like that would undoubtedly require.<n> <n><n> <n><n> To this day, I&#39;m not sure if what I saw was something of &#34;ours,&#34; or not, but I came away from the experience feeling like anything was possible.<n>

I do know that it was cold enough to have been in the Fall.  The reason I am posting this is because I have been sitting on it for so long and I have read and reread the report for 11/01/95 from my town and what my friend and I saw seems so similar that I am wondering if it was the same thing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was driving my friend home really late at night- some time between 1am and 3am I guess, as that was the normal time for me to drive her home when she&#39;d visit.  I turned down a side street, using the same way I always took her home (so I would not have to turn around on her street to get back to the main road).  When we got to the stop sign at the end of the street there was a very bright light kind of hovering above the power lines in the field across the street, I think what you call high tension lines- the ones on the huge metal structures.  I would say that, if I think about it, it may have been the size of a dime at arm&#39;s length.  Anyway, we&#39;re at the stop sign and looking and I said, &#34;Do you see that?&#34;  And my friend said, &#34;What is it?&#34; and she wanted to get out of the car.  It was kind of surreal.  I can&#39;t remember if I put the car in park but I must have.  I reached to my friend and held her shirt so she wouldn&#39;t get out because I was terrified, like the blood drained from my body (I can feel it as I am typing this and remembering).  The thing hovered for a little bit, maybe 2 minutes or maybe more, it seemed like forever.  I also remember briefly wanting to get out of the car and look but by then it started to move parallel to the street I had been going to turn onto, going the same direction which I believe is W or NW.  So I turned the car and we watched it going faster until our vision was blocked by trees and I had to turn onto her street (the street we were on ends abruptly).<n> <n><n> <n><n> Afterwards we talked about it and I remember saying her mother would be angry she had missed it because she was very much into reading about UFO&#39;s and other things like that.  We both agreed it was not a plane.  Neither of us were drinking or doing drugs and we were both several years out of High School by then.  I live right on one of the flight paths for Logan Int&#39;l Airport and am pretty used to and familiar with the airplane paths and their looks.  The night was also clear so they were not running many patterns over our area.  Never reported this to anyone except family.  To this day if I drive down that particular street I stare up at those wires just in case.<n> <n><n> <n><n> If you need to contact me, I&#39;d prefer by email.  I feel kind of nervous making a report as it is, because of all the stories you hear.  I can make a drawing or diagram if it would help.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>
11/1/95 00:30|Lakeport (near)|CA|Light|5 hours|Two brothers hunting 6 miles from the main road. Parked on a pullout near the top of the ridgetop. Saw red-green halo light moving acro|3/7/98|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/001/S01914.html|119|ndxe199511| SUMMARY:  Two brothers hunting 6 miles from the main road. Parked on a pullout near the top of the ridgetop. Saw red-green halo light moving across opposite ridgetop where no road existed.  Traversed ridge at medium speed then stopped, shot up to higher altitude, performed some unusual aerial manuevers before parking in the sky to the SE. It was soon joined by another identical light which also became stationary.  A large, flat, silent dark perfect triangular craft came down between the two lights and proceeded directly by them up the valley. It flew below the top of the ridge and was clearly visible for 30 seconds to a minute before it passed out of sight. The two lights remained where they were and were visible even after daylight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> &#34;Dunn sighting&#34; two. The brothers were hunting near Highland Springs and were again sitting in their truck parked in a pullout near the ridgetop facing east, looking out over the valley between them and the opposite ridge.  It was approximately 1/2 to 3/4 mile across. Suddenly a light appeared to the NE over the opposite ridge.  They both thought it was a vehicle at first but having hunted the ridge they knew there was no road there only brush.  At brushtop height and as large as a truck the light progressed along the ridge.  Viewing it with a 20power spotting scope they describe it as a redish-green pulsing light with a clear white light in the middle.they didn&#39;t know what it was but were able to follow it in the scope,(on a tripod), until it reached the end of the ridge to the SE. There it &#39;jumped&#39; back and forth in the sky for a number of minutes. They were unable to keep it in the viewfinder during these &#39;jumps&#39;.  It then became stationary in the sky.  After a while, from the SE and much further away, a second identical light appeared and flew toward the first one, joining it slightly further to the west but also stationary.  The two lights never moved again.  About 04:30 a large flat, dark and perfectly triangular craft came from between the two lights.  At first they thought it was a plane but it came directly down the canyon they were looking out over, from SE to NW, and lower than the opposite ridge.  It flew at a steady crusing speed and made no sound except for the sound of air being pushed, like a hissing breeze. There was a slight haloed gaseous effect coming from the craft that made it difficult to observe with !the scope but didn&#39;t affect the nnaked eye.  A single spotting clear light shone out ahead from the middle underside of the craft.  What appeared to be windows also were apparent.  They both felt that if they could see it, it could see them and they felt like sitting ducks!  However they were not as frightened as the first time they witnessed a sighting. The way it cruised by reminded them of tourists driving through town.  They estimated it at approximately 25 yards wide.  As it passed two red lights, like taillights shone out from the back of the craft.  They waited for the noise but none came.  They stayed at the spot until dawn, viewing the two original bright lights.  These lights remained in exactly the same location and were so bright they could still be observed after daylight.  They finally got tired of watching and drove home.  Two interesting questions are posed by their two sightings in different wilderness locations.  Either they are simply fortunate to have been !in the direct paths, away from civilization, of these vehicles and their sightings are mere coincidences, or the crafts flew by them purposely.  In both cass they were entirely visible to any vehicle at a higher altitude from great distances away.  Also it seems outlandishly coincidental that they just happened on the particular routes of these crafts, when miles of alternative wilderness areas exist. It may also indicate a similar flight pattern of wilderness routing though it seems odd that if this routing exists to decrease sightings, no attempt was made to hide themselves from these two entirely visible observers.  The Dunn&#39;s are totally reputable men, from midland farm families, as down to earth as you can get!  They never even considered the possibility of what they witnessed until it was before them.  they still exhibit some fear as to the identity and purpose of the crafts and have not discussed or reported the events publicly. But they are now watching continually.  D!unn sighting one contains the report of their first sighting as well as their most recent land -based phenomena sighting.  They are taking me to the sights soon. I&#39;m looking forward to it!    wolf<n>
