1/15/47 10:00|Yokahama (Japan)||Disk|30 minutes|The Flying Object over Yocohama Japan after WWII in 1947|2/14/06|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/048/S48938.html|1|ndxe194701| The Flying Object over Yocohama Japan after WWII in 1947<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am making this report to make sure it is recorded.  I learned of this event around June of 1947.  The person who told me was my good friend ((name deleted)).<n> <n><n> <n><n> As a background, understand that after WWII, many American Officers brought their families to Europe and Japan as a part of the Dependents of the Occupation Forces.  I was one of these dependents, my age was 10 years old.  We lived in the ((deleted)) Compound on the Bluff, by the horse racing track and POW camp, at the edge of Yocohama, Japan.  We, the ((family name deleted)) lived in House ((deleted)) and the ((family name #2 deleted)) lived in House ((deleted)) Compound.  The houses were two story with flat roofs.  The roofs were made to use, much like a top deck.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((name deleted)), son of Colonel ((name deleted)), 8th Army in Occupation, was with his father one morning.  They had a Japanese brass telescope Colonel ((name deleted)) brought home for his son. They also had a 7X binocular.  They were experimenting with the telescope, at the time this occured.   I will paraphrase what ((name deleted)) told me, for it is worth being recorded.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They were taking turns looking through the telescope and binocular when ((name deleted)) father noticed a dark shape in the sky.  A perfect target on which to experiment with.  Colonel ((name deleted)) first looked at it through the binoculars, then took the telescope and brought the boject into its field of view and focus.  I was soccer shaped. ((<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((name deleted)) said he and his dad took turns watching this object through both the binocuar and the telescope.  It was traveling toward them.  It traveled over to and above the race track and paused.  That was about one mile away.  It paused.  ((name deleted)) said it was not high, probably several thousand feet in the air.  This would put it under any cloud cover.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I asked what did it look like?  It looked like a soccer, it was &#34;metal-like, but the underside was somewhat darker.  The edge of the soccer was sharp, not rounded.  It had no windows or such.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I asked what did it do?  It move around and then stopped in the sky and just hovered.  Then it would move to another locaation and again hover.<n> <n><n> <n><n> For the record, at the time (1947) Yocohama showed the full brunt of many B-29 strikes.  The city was 90% burned out with an occasional structure standing amist a totally distroyed area, block after block.  Down toward the harbor, the canals were chocked with sunken wooden junks.  Out in the harbor several large ships were sunken in the harbor. The dock facilities were equally damaged.  The city was totally distroyed.  Many of the people who lived in the hills surrounding Yocahoma were really the only houses spaired by the bombing strikes.  The race track wa also spared, probably because it was a POW camp.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((name deleted)) said this &#34;craft&#34; was slowly crossing across the destroyed city.  It looked like it was inspecting the damage.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Where did it go?  I asked.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It went across us and slowly made it way across the city heading toward the harbor.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Did you see it by eye and in the binocular and telescope?  Oh sure, it was easy to follow.  I was in good view, expecially in the telescope.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What did it look like?  Like a soccer.  It was round, it was soccer shaped.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Did it make a noise?  No, not at all.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was totally perplexed.  This was the first time I ever heard of a flying machine shaped like a soccer.  All flying machines had wings and big motors and they dropped bombs and shot machine guns and made lots of noise.  None hovered!  How long did you watch it?  I asked in perplexed wonder.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A long time, we watched it go out toward the harbor.  It moved around, paused and then turned off toward the left(toward Mount Fugiama) It slowly moved off.  we watched it until we could not see it any more, even in the telescope.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What was it?  I don&#39;t know.  It wasn&#39;t an airplane.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What did your dad say?  He said it wasn&#39;t an airplane.  He didn&#39;t know what it was, but it was real, we could see it.  The binocuar and telescope gave us real good views.<n> <n><n> <n><n> With that, we went on to other things that 10 year boys do.  We probably went over to the open field where we played baseball with the Jananese children.  I played right field.   I seem to remember ((name deleted)) was a baseman.  Anyway that was the end of our conversation about the unidenitfied flying object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I left Japan in August of 1947.  I believe ((name deleted)) was still living in House # ((deleted)).  I do remember asking him about this strange soccer.  I asked what his father did.<n> <n><n> <n><n> He reported it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I asked, what happened?  He said, &#34;Nothing.   We never heard another thing.&#34;  As far as I know, that is where it ended.  His father being a full bird coloner in the 8th US Army, like mine were pretty VIP.  He reported it through chnnels and that was that.  They did not receive any feed-back, as of August 1947.  However make no mistake, the US Army was duely notified of the sighting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> That&#39;s as much as I know.   I hope ((name deleted)) or his father have already made this report. In this case, I prefer to defer to that that said.  At any rate, this is as much as I know, as close to the actual conversations as I can remember.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((name deleted))  Dependent, Army of Occupation Yocuhama, Japan 1947<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

I was ten years old, ridding in the front seat of our car next to the passanger door.  My mother was in the center front and Dad was driving north on old highway 75 neaar Conroe Tx. headed home to Corsicana, Tx. My clear memory is aided by the many times I heard both parents relate the story to others who voiced simular experiences.  As we traveled up a slight hill with a curve at the top to the right, traveling approximately 60mph, a semi-circle of five or six bright white lights came over the hill following the road, straight at but above our car at what appeared to be less than 100ft. in the air.  There was no sound but our engine.  Immediately in front of our car the object [or objects in formation] made an abrubt, right angle turn to the right, our left, toward the west and quickly disappeared over a row of trees about 200ft. off the highway.  After a moment of stunned silence, my Dad said, &#34;Did you see that damn thing?&#34;, to which both my mother and I responded, &#34;Yes, what was it?&#34;  None of us had a clue.  Desperate for a solution, Mother said, &#34;Maybe it was our car lights on highwires&#34;.  Dad quickly pointed out that there were none.  Even more desperately she said, &#34;Maybe it was birds&#34;. &#34;With bright lights tied on?&#34;, responded Dad.  &#34;Well, she searched, &#34;Maybe they got into flourescent paint&#34;?&#34;.  Frustrated, Dad bluntly said &#34;No.  That was some kind of object or several objects doing something I have never seen before&#34;. Only later that year, with the &#34;flying saucer&#34; flap, did we realize what we had witnessed.  The object was real, it made a manuver impossible for any then [or now] known aircraft, made no noise, and, importantly, we were not &#34;programed&#34; for such an experience.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I could add much more about another highly anomolous light performace I observed with one other unknown witness in the mid 1950&#39;s. There are many credible, first hand observations related to me, such as one by an ex-fighter pilot, a geologist, scrambled out of Japan to pursue a clearly visable fire orange craft that played can and mouse with him until altitude forced him to turn back [it was his frightening debriefing that was the real story], a private pilot for and oil company CEO viewing a spinning &#34;top-shaped object&#34; in day light over West Texas, a very conservative Episcopal priest with a daytime viewing of a  circular craft near and slow enough to observe windows along the side, and many other clear, detailed, objective sightings that, like mine, have never been reported.  Thank you for the good work. Keep it up.  Times are changing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of sighting is approximate.  PD))<n>

There were green lights and some marking on the side, but that was all she could describe.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was very non-eventful and everyone just got back to dinner afterwards as they thought it was something new the RAF had brought in!<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have not reported this before, and I know it&#39;s a bit late, but thought you might be interested.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Bahrain has quite a few incidences that occur with sightings - my Father worked for the RAF while he was out there, and has had to sign a document to say he would not disclose a formation of 6 UFO&#39;s in late 1950&#39;s, along with his colleagues, but I think this document&#39;s time limit has lapsed now.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.
