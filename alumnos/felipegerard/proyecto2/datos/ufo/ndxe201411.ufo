We saw it a few nights ago but I didn&#39;t have my phone on me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Tonight, I got a pic and a 2 minute video of the object.  The object was orange in color and changed to red. It glowed bright. It came from the east.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object stopped in mid flight.  It then moved slightly left and right before going backwards and northeast.<n>

11/30/14 20:20|San Diego|CA|Light|45 seconds|Neon blue light with a smaller reddish part moving faster than the incoming jets and making erratic turns.|12/5/14|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/115/S115761.html|4|ndxe201411| Neon blue light with a smaller reddish part moving faster than the incoming jets and making erratic turns<n> <n><n> <n><n> About an hour and a half ago, at 8:20pm (give or take a couple of minutes), I was standing outside in the Mission Hills Mini Park.  I was looking NNW, when a neon blue light came into my field of vision.  Again, it was mostly a neon blue, but there was a much smaller red light glow or light too.  The red light was about one quarter the size as the neon blue or smaller.  The light was as large and as bright as the landing light of an incoming jet preparing to land at the San Diego airport.  The light did not blink off and on as the anti-collision lights do.  It was a steady light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Anyway, this light was moving very fast from the east to the west when it came into my field of vision.  Within 3 seconds it was NW of me and made a 180 degree turn.  It came back east a little and then went almost straight down but at a slight angle.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It disappeared for 20 seconds or so behind the tree line across the canyon and then came back up for 10 seconds.  It moved in a swimming motion in different directions.  Then down again below the tree line; almost straight down, but again at a slight angle.  This was not a long way away from me; it was close.  The light was closer than the planes coming south towards the San Diego airport.  When the planes are preparing to land, they get close to the airport and turn or head east along the Interstate 8 freeway corridor before turning back to the San Diego airport.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So, this light was moving much faster than the planes preparing for their approach to the airport and of course was closer to me than the Planes heading east along the Interstate corridor.  This light was also lower than the incoming jets and planes at all times in this sighting and must have come down close to the ground in order for me to loose sight of it, twice, behind the tree line across Dove Canyon (western finger of Dove Canyon).<n> <n><n> <n><n> This light moved gracefully, but not in straight lines.  It moved slightly erratically, a little like a d! olphin swimming rather than straight lines.  When it made a 180 degree turn, it was almost instantaneously.  This obviously was not a plane or helicopter.  If it was a drone, it would have to have been a jet powered drone, but that is not possible either, since there was no sound.<n>
11/30/14 20:03|Mumbai (India)||Fireball|~8 minutes|Orange fireball with a bright square in the middle!|12/5/14|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/115/S115758.html|5|ndxe201411| Orange fireball with a bright square in the middle !<n> <n><n> <n><n> I live in India, and I witnessed a UFO sighting yesterday at 20:03 hours.  There were fireworks going on, and suddenly, I saw something that was glowing like a star and was orange, but was quite closer than how a real star would appears to be.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was flying approximately at the height of a plane and then I saw another one flying behind it, around 5 of those things appeared one a after the other and flew across the sky while I managed to take a photo and a video.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In the picture it looked like a dot maybe because the glowing effect is cut out.  When I zoomed in, it looked like a fireball with a bright lighted yellowish square inside.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Since I have heard a lot of stories of how different UFOs appear to be, I immediately noticed that it was similar to what I saw in an episode of Destination Truth.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I read another report on a similar fireball UFO, even there it was mentioned that it was sighted when fireworks were going on, from which I thought that a firework environment has something to do with this phenomenon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Source indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

Flying from the east to west.  As it came over my head.  It was some sort of craft.  With a orange glow FWD and AFT.  All around as it passed over head.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It definitely had a blue flame.  Much like the after-burners on a fighter jet.  It made no noise.  No noise.  Commercial jets fly over head 35k you can hear them.  It definitely had some sort propulsion engine.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As far as the size of this aircraft, it was 5 times the size of a commercial jet flying at altitude.  I guess that&#39;s the best way to describe it.  It looked like it was flying maybe 10,000 feet at the most.  With no noise I just assumed it was much higher.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was between 18:30 and 19:00<n>

That&#39;s when I seen its full size and triangle shape.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was headed south west after it banked.  I lost sight after it banked cause of trees.  It was so low, I kept watching the area for a sign of crash or smoke.

11/30/14 15:58|Lynxville|WI|Circle|2.5 minutes|It was 15:58 PM-The last day of Deer season.

I&#39;m sitting my truck, watching 2 fields for deer.  Facing due east.  From possibly 15 degrees north/north east and possibly 10 miles away, a round disk shaped object came from N/E Iowa at probably Mach 2.  It had a white hue around its front. The sun was at my back.  The object was like polished st/steel.  It came to a dead stop one half mile due east of me and hung in the air for about 2 minuts. After it stoped the hue went away.  It looked like the cover of a Revere Ware sauce pan, on its edge.  After about 2 min&#39;s, the thing turned 90 degrees and gave a huge, bright, white flash and then dissappeared. Its elevation was less then 1000 feet.  There were seris clouds in an otherwise clear afternoon.  Comparing its size to a farm house behind it, I estimate it to be about 30 feet in diameter--It was approximately 1/2 mile from my position.  I had a cell phone and a camera on my center consul, but never even thought about taking a pic.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

11/30/14 13:00|Grande Prairie (Canada)|AB|Unknown|10 minutes|I was driving to a remote oilfield site by myself (which is very typical) to do maintenance work. I am a very practical person.|12/5/14|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/115/S115746.html|17|ndxe201411| I was driving to a remote oilfield site by myself (which is very typical) to do maintenance work.  I am a very practical person, I handle panic situations very well, 26 years old, female, electrician by trade.  So, I am traveling South East on the main freeway/highway between Valleyview, Alberta, towards Fox Creek, Alberta.  I scanned the horizon out of boredom, as it was a nice day compared to the last few, sun is shining so I wear my polarized sunglasses, also typical.  This first part may be of absolutely no connection to the rest of the story, but I am including it just in case.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I looked at the sky and saw what looked like a small trapped amount of rainbow in a cloud.  I thought it was pretty, or visually appealing, and as I drove I could tell I was seeing slightly less and less of it.  At its clearest definition, it looked like it was caused by the sun shining directly into a funnel-like shape in the cloud, I thought it was probably just some natural phenomena of the sun and color spectrum and shape of the cloud/moisture in it.  Totally explainable but just beyond my understanding or comprehension of science/nature/or physics.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Suddenly, as I pulled into a straight section of the highway, the colorful cloud disappeared and at a different location in the sky what looks to be about 4 feet upwards from the horizon, at a distance of roughly (going off of odometer distance at the time from Fox Creek 40-60 km, rough estimate I know, sorry).  Anyways, it just appeared at this location ahead of me, with a short white tail much like a comets, but it was too short, it didn&#39;t look like any jet stream/tail that I have ever noticed before, and the object appeared to be falling at a rapid speed.  I concluded it must have been a comet, headed somewhat towards my direction and that was why the tail appeared short, must have been due to my perspective/angle to the object.  I had trouble making out the shape of it, but there was definitely some sort of head of the “comet-like object” that had sharp edges that stood out against the tail in the background of it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The next second, I look up, it just stopped its rapid descent and sat in the skyline, radiating a very small pink light in the distance ahead of me, about 1 foot up from the horizon from my current position, driving rapidly towards it at 100 km/hour.  I am going back and forth between driving safely (as it&#39;s icy winter conditions) and watching this happen on the horizon, and it is easy for me to continue looking at the exact spot in the sky because i am driving in a straight line and there are structures in the distance in which to reference it by.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I next look up, there is a very short horizontal line appearing to the bottom right of the pink dot in the sky, that was NOT there a moment ago, and in the time span I watch it move (speaking from my driving perspective) what appears about a inch across the sky, then the next second I look up, both the pink dot and short horizontal white dash across the sky have vanished.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I don&#39;t think I&#39;m crazy, I have no history of hallucinating or psychological disorders, or even making up stories, though I do believe in the possibility of other life somewhere in the universe, but I don&#39;t believe I was desiring there to be so much that I made it up in my sub-conscious for whatever reason, at first I really was just scared that it was a comet or asteroid, and was actually going to hit the earth, until it stopped, and sat there, glowing pink.  I do a lot of troubleshooting and observation due to my job, so it is easy for me to observe a process without involving any bias or personal feelings into it.  And it was broad day light, I had just been driving for an hour on my way to work, after a good night&#39;s rest and a normal breakfast.  I don&#39;t know what I saw, but there is no part of what I saw that resembled a plane, jet, or helicopter.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We have changed the time above, to reflect a daytime sighting.

Since there are many ai4craft in the area, I at first thought it was the landing lights of an aircraft.  There was no sound at all and the sphere remained motionless for approx 1 min.  It then shot straight downward at an incredible rate of speed.  I lost sight of it.  It was definitely not a helicopter,  piston or jet aircraft, nor was it a meteor.<n>

For several minutes before saying anything (I was reading out loud, oblivious) she kept her eye on a craft she saw over a mountain to the south of us.  This was about five to ten miles east of Deming.  She pointed it out &#34;this thing isn&#39;t moving&#34;.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The craft was large, black with a shape we could not define.  Hot air balloon?  Definitely not.  Blimp?  Nope.  Helicopter?  Maybe.  If it was a very, very, very large helicopter remaining stationary for an incredible length of time.  We watched this thing closely.  It was at least two hundred feet above the peak of the mountain but we could not discern how far south (how far away from us) it was.  We were certain, though, that it wasn&#39;t moving.  Not up nor down and if it was moving away it was doing so at an amazingly slow pace.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We passed the mountain to see that it was avidly quite far from the mountain and closer to the town of Deming.  We exited a few miles up and attempted to head south in the town to get a closer look.  At this point the sun was going down quickly.  It wasn&#39;t until then my girlfriend claimed see some light flashing on the craft every so often, something we hadn&#39;t witnessed from the craft even though airplanes nearby were lit up for a long time before this.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Now it finally appeared to be moving further south of Deming at an extremely slow pace.  We decided to return to I-10 and were able to keep our eyes on it until we drove too far away in the darkness for any further visibility.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I will add that at certain points  we were witnessing  what appeared to be two pieces of the craft sort of pulling slightly apart and coming back together.  I rationalized that if it was a large military chopper it could&#39;ve been shifting position and we were seeing it angle the propellers toward then away from us.  If I&#39;m being totally honest though it looked much stranger than that.  I also felt as though I was seeing an aura or field of sorts around it, but that could simply have been my mind playing tricks with the sky around the craft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> All in all we watched this huge craft essentially hover with no lights for over thirty minutes near Deming.  We have some crappy phone cam footage.  Would really like to get into contact with others who seem to have witnessed something similar near Deming!<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides little contact information.

I was about 3 or 4 miles west of the sth 12/14 interchange in Middleton, WI, when I noticed a red flashing orb at about the 5 o’clock position.  The orb caught my eye because my first thought was when did they put up a new TV tower and gosh it must be tall.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After a few seconds I realized it was moving rather quickly, and obviously not stationary.  Due to the color it was emitting, I noted it couldn’t be an airplane, as the size of the object would be way to large to be an aircraft’s strobe lights and there was no green or white light either.  I would guess it was also traveling 2 or 3 times faster than your standard jet based on how quickly it was moving away from me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then when it was starting to near the end of my visible horizon it took a hard left heading northerly with a slight downward trajectory while also to remarkably double its original speed and quickly went out of view.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I would like to stress this light was definitely not a reflection from within the cab of my vehicle nor a light somehow reflecting off my windshield.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I would estimate this light was originally flying several thousand feet off the ground, maybe 2 or 3 in my best estimation before making its turn and descent.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The light it emitted was rather unusual, as it appeared to have a slightly foggy characteristic about it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

With tall trees on both sides of the street along my pathway, I had a clear view for about 3 to 5 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What made this unusual were a couple of things:<n> <n><n> <n><n> 1)	  The object was flying very low and going down in what I would describe as about 10,000 feet when first coming into view from the right and at about 7,500 feet when going out of view to my left.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 2)	  The nose of the object was at about a 170 degree angle up and the tail equally down as it went by, descending.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 3)  	I immediately rolled down my window and did not hear a thing.  I drove slowly half expecting to hear an explosion but heard nothing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I continued on the road I looked at other drivers to see if anyone else was acting like they saw what I saw.  I started to wonder if perhaps it may have been a radio controlled kit, but the field of vision would have made the object out of visible range from any natural place to fly one (residential area, crossing fairly busy road).<n> <n><n> <n><n> I turned on my radio to the local all news station expecting another 9-11 or plane crash ‘happening now’ breaking story but heard nothing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I Googled when I got home to see if anyone else posted about it but found nothing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After thinking about it some more an hour or so later, I decided it was way to obvious that I saw something out of the ordinary and decided to check online for where to report it.  This lead me to the National UFO Reporting website.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am also sending an illustration I am putting together to clearly visualize what I saw.<n>

I thought it was a drone or remote controlled aircraft, BUT there was no sound at all.  They moved slowly and seemed to be “floating” in the sky.  One came closer to us and then sailed out over the ocean and finally disappeared as it got too far away to see.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Another one followed it but never came close to us.  Then another.

When walking outside, I looked south towards the southeast.  I am guessing the lights were past the airport and had a bright orange/ reddish to them.  Not blinking or strobing but a strong glow to them.  As all were lit the formation was a &#34;L&#34;-ish figure up high, with a count of thirteen glowing lights individually synced.  I called my Friend to hurry come look when they finally saw what I did the upper part was not lit and the lower five that were horizontal were.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It lasted for about 15-30 sec. I checked to see if the news or anything was reported the following day and nothing was there I just switched off my phone so I was not able to take a picture but looked up strange lights in the sky on google.

As we were paying a visit to wish grandma a Happy Thanksgiving, we happen to notice a light that was not a regular part of the hillside.  It was seeming to float above the towers up on Lookout Mt. in Golden.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We watched the light,which was a orange amber colored oval shape light, dancing above the towers.  It moved and got lower to the horizon and shifted to the right.  And began to station itself above the third tower.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This was not the only thing this orb did, it grew and shrank in size, and would turn off like a light.  And reappear again.  It would vanish and reappear in the same spot.  After viewing it 20 minutes, it was gone! Like it just vanished in thin air!<n> <n><n> <n><n> I also went home, and got on the bike to see if I could investigate further.  I brought my highest viewing binos with me.  And to no avail, was not able to find the light that was over the towers on Lookout Mt.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am trained and UFO investigator, since 2000.  I have many hours of field work.  And keep logs of what I see each year, and yearly on since today!  I have been seeing lots of these orange orbs here CO, and they seem to be apart of the night skies year after year!  But this orb was special to have seen.  It was the longest I have seen stay in one spot and disappear in thin air!<n> <n><n> <n><n> The temp outside was a 55 degrees and the moon was above the mountain as well.  Also, there was a few air traffic that flew above the orb, and that was when it turned off and then came back again after the plane had passed.  Which was very interesting to witness.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My mom and I were so amazed, we knew it was not something of our known knowledge.  So, we both said, &#34;UFO!&#34;  Couldn&#39;t identify it, and therefore was unknown to us.  Keep on looking Coloradans..  The skies keep getting more interesting over the years here!  Nights are fun to catch these orbs up in the foothills here in the Metro area.  Keep your eyes to the skies!<n>

Not all lights would show on camera and video.  Upon zooming other lights I didn&#39;t see by eye did show, I believe these may have been aircraft in the distance approaching the lights.  Lights appeared to be toward Seattle area but not directly over the city which is 20 miles south of me.<n>

Both of were in separate locations inside of the dwelling.  I was watching college football, while she was in one of the bedrooms folding clothes.  The event was a flash, similar to what is seen when a light bulb burns out, except it was uniform.  Both of us saw a flash which didn&#39;t seem to come from anywhere inside the house, and didn&#39;t seem to come from a uniform area of outside.  It looked to me like it came from the south side, while to her it looked like it came from the north side of the house.  Went outside to identify anything that could have made the uniform flash, and could find nothing.  We have trees in our rear lot, and a brick wall in the front, but the flash seemed to be uniform, unobstructed by these objects.<n>

There were no other vehicles in my sight.  The light appeared to be about 4 inches in diameter and about 4 to 6 feet off the ground.  I was travelling between 75 and 80 miles per hour and I was not gaining on the light as fast as I thought I should at the speed I was going.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After a few seconds, the light rapidly moved southbound until it was alongside my vehicle and immediately matched my speed.

There were no other cars on the road at that moment and the only sound was the rain on the windshield.  It had some small lights on its belly.  It was somewhat delta-shaped but it appeared to have two sections carved out of its tail giving the impression of wings but it was still one solid object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It followed the tree line, floating majestically over it, banked and then descended into a field on the other side of the tree line.

We were talking outside when we noticed an orange orb fly above us.  We stared at it because it looked like nothing we have ever seen before.  It flew from the north to the south until it disappeared into the night horizon.  We were puzzled because it definitely was not a helicopter, or a plane.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Immediately after it disappeared, and during our discussion of what it could be, another orange orb originated from the same place.  We watched the first one come from and it took the same exact flight route immediately above us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> For this orb I quickly reached for my cell phone and began snapping away pictures (I will follow up with an email including all pictures I took).<n> <n><n> <n><n> Again, as soon as the 2nd orb disappeared, the 3rd orange orb began its trip.  It also took the same route as the first two orbs and disappeared into the night&#39;s horizon.  I also took a few pictures of the 3rd orb.  My parents and I s! tayed for a few minutes outside searching the sky for more, but did not see any more.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Curiously enough, the pictures do not all reflect what we saw with the naked eye.  Also note that some of the pictures I tried using the zoom feature.  And lastly, the orbs made absolutely no noise as they passed directly above us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The other two witnesses were my retired parents.

11/27/14 19:45|Gurnee|IL|Sphere|5 minutes|Bright yellow-orange lights moving west over Lake County, IL.|12/5/14|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/115/S115674.html|65|ndxe201411| Bright yellow-orange lights moving west over Lake County, IL.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At about 7:45pm CDT, leaving my niece’s home after a family Thanksgiving dinner in Gurnee, Illinois, as I reached my car parked on the street, I noticed two very bright yellow-orange lights in the sky.  Not sure of their altitude, probably something between that of a low-flying plane but higher than a helicopter would fly, if that makes sense.  The lights were in a horizontal configuration, one a good distance (maybe an inch at arm’s length) higher than the other, with the lower object slightly ahead of the other as they moved slowly from east to west.  They weren’t big, maybe like BBs, but very bright.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was standing northwest of them, and they could have been a couple miles or so south of my position.  Though two very distinct lights, they moved in tandem and seemed in fixed positions in relation to each other, as though connected.  I didn’t see anything connecting them, nor any stars between them, but the night sky was overcast and not many stars were visible.  No sound, but at that distance, unless they were jets or helicopters, I probably wouldn’t have heard any engine noise.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Must admit, I’m fascinated by UFOs, but have never seen one before.  However, I know enough to look for the green and red lights required for aircraft, and there was no other color in these objects except for the very bright yellow-orange color, like polished gold.  As they moved west, each of the orbs seemed to have some shadow on its rear side, so they looked almost like tightly curled commas.  Traveling a little farther west, the top light looked like it had a separate, smaller light following immediately behind it, possibly part of it.  The color was so bright and so consistent otherwise that they looked like shiny metal structures.  But whatever light they had must have come from them because there is nothing in the area to illuminate them at that height, and the crescent moon was behind them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My first thought was, “Darn, I don’t have my camera with me.”  Then my niece came out of the house to bring me something I’d left behind, and we both stood there for a couple minutes watching these lights and trying to figure out what they possibly could be.  She is not at all interested in UFOs, and probably thought I was little nuts being so fixated on these objects.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The closest familiar object they resembled would be Chinese lanterns, but the bright color was stable, not flickering. Flares?  They moved together at a level altitude straight west and I assume flares might drop or lose altitude.  They didn’t have a “fuzzy” glow, even in the overcast, but were bright, hard lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I watched these for approximately five minutes, and they moved slowly but at a perfectly steady rate across the sky, covering a distance of about eight inches at arm’s length.  Then they disappeared without changing shape or size, without falling to the ground or anything. They just went out.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My location would be about 30 miles north of O’Hare Airport, and the lights I saw would have been coming from Lake Michigan, possibly 10-15 miles east of O’Hare.  And again, they didn’t have the FFA lights, nor anything resembling the configuration of lights that I’ve ever seen on commercial aircraft.  There’s a smaller airport, Waukegan Regional Airport, about 10 miles north of Gurnee, but the lights were heading west, not north.  I drove by Waukegan Airport a few minutes later, and don’t think it was even open.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Have no idea what they were.  Just very curious.<n>

Just past the airport and on the right, over a neighborhood, you could see them.  Real bright diamond and hexagon shaped orange lights.  The pattern looked like if they were being held up like a string of lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I pulled off and went into the neighborhood to take a look and see what they were to find that they were free moving objects slowly heading south easterly.  From the bottom they appeared round and looked to be weather or hot air balloons.  At first there were three. They were close enough to tell that they certainly were not balloons.  They were low and holding elavation.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As soon as the first one got in what would have been almost right over the airport.  We could see what looked like a cloth or shading extend out and fold over the bottom.  Which darkened it from all sides and made the bottom appear to match the stars at a much further distance.  Fortunately we have a lot of smoke looming over the city from a mulch fire which made the shadings visible slightly enough too see it eventually disappearing from view.  As soon as the first one went out the other two followed.  They picked up speed and were gone in seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Suddenly another one appears.  And then a much larger one appeared brighter and closer to the first three.  And did the same thing.  Another one appeared to come back around from where the others left.  And then reversed and disappeared.  Definitely not planes helicopters or weather balloons.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Attempted to call the airport, they blew me off.<n>

They looked like red flames with dark yellow center.  They were hovering for approximately two to three minutes then one of them started to move upward and south. The red light started to change intensity as it traveled, then it suddenly picked up speed, still heading south on an upward trajectory and within 30 seconds of acceleration, suddenly disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The second craft had remained in its original position, and continued to hover and was bright red with yellow center. After the other craft disappeared, it started to head north towards us maintaining the same altitude. Movement caused its lights to vary in intensity just as it had the other. It continued north for about a minute, then rapidly reversed direction, increasing speed, then started an upward trajectory as the lights became more dim then suddenly, at an altitude where it would still have been easily visible, it disappeared; like someone turned a light switch off.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There were no other aircraft in the vicinity during or within an hour before this event.

They looked like traveling &#34;red candle flames&#34;, with a yellow center.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This sighting is remarkable for, 1) soundless craft, 2) rapid in-line change of direction, 3) rapid acceleration from hovering, 4) complete disappearance in an instant, 5) shape of craft inconsistent with known aircraft, 6) colored light completely surrounding the craft, 7) variation in intensity of lights between hover and movement (light grew brighter when it hovered or slowed).<n> <n><n> <n><n> This report was also phoned in.

It was midway between the horizon and Orion.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I asked my wife to look at it we began to notice that it was moving.  The movement was pretty erratic.  Side to side and up and down.  Never moving very far in any direction and not moving particularly fast.  For long periods it remains stationary.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At times it appeared to have a greenish color.  We watched it for at least 15 minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We have also observed the orange lights that others have reported.<n>

11/25/14 18:30|Oak Hill|WV|Triangle|2 hours|Giant levitating triangle followed our car with four people inside from Stone Cliff to Oak Hill.|11/26/14|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/115/S115633.html|102|ndxe201411| Giant levitating triangle followed our car with four people inside from Stone Cliff to Oak Hill.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was taking an evening drive with my sister and our two friends.  Around 6:00 pm we drove to Thurmond to look at the stars and watch the night sky, which was clear at this time.  We stopped the car and got out at the Stone Cliff sand bar.  We sat and watched the sky for around 30 minutes before we noticed a very bright, bouncing light up on the ridge line across the river.  Then we noticed there was two other dimmer lights that moved as a unit with the bright light, this is how we realized it was triangular.  The lights on the craft became very dim at times, but then they would brighten.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We got in the car and drove up on the bridge at Stone Cliff to get a better view.  This is when we noticed the craft stayed parallel and kept up with us as we drove, though it was still across the river and hovering up over the ridge line relatively far away from us.  It moved  and rotated very quickly, faster than any plane, helicopter, or satellite and it was also very large, but completely silent.  We drove toward Thurmond near the ranger station and pulled over again, and this is when we noticed the craft crossing the river and hovering toward us.  The triangular shape became larger as it neared us, it hovered over the tree line and stayed behind us.  We were fearful at this point and began driving back toward Oak Hill.  The craft followed the road, hovering above the tree and ridge line, while maintaining a close distance to our car.  At one point the giant, levitating triangle was directly above us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On the drive home from Thurmond we pulled over several times (at Red Star and Hilltop) and got out of the vehicle in order to view the triangle.  The craft stayed within our vicinity most of the drive back to town, but I lost sight for a short time.  I regained sight of the craft when we came to the intersection at Route 19, because I saw it hovering far above the road, and the lights on the craft seemed to be bouncing again.  As we neared the lights of Oak Hill I lost sight of the triangle once more, but when we arrived at my house the craft had followed us there.  The triangle was closer to the surface of the earth than it had been before, hovering above the tree line.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We stood on my drive way and I showed my mother and other friend the craft.  The time was around 8:00 or 8:30 pm at this time and clouds had began moving in and the craft had become very dim.  The craft moved to a clearing in the clouds above my house, at this time my friend had no trouble viewing the craft, as its lights had become bright again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> All witnesses agree that we saw an extraordinary levitating triangle in the sky, though it was clearer and brighter at times.  Only 4 of us witnessed the triangle at Stone Cliff, but 6 people (that I know of) saw the triangle when it was in Oak Hill.  The whole sighting lasted around 2 hours, most of the viewing at Stone Cliff and Thurmond, but it hovered over our neighborhood for a quite awhile (until we lost sight due to cloud coverage).  I know this is an incredibly long UFO sighting, and strange because the triangle noticed and followed us.  I believe it could have easily abducted us if had it wanted to, but the triangle only observed us without interaction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke via telephone with the witness, and we found her to be sober-minded and serious in her demeanor.

Rapidly moving.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At approximately 2:45 am, I whitnessed 4 spherical lights around 40-50 feet in the air.  The sky was clear, as it was a cold winter morning.  2 of the lights were white in colour, and 2 were more yellowish..  There was no noise to suggest farm machinery, etc., or an aircraft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What drew my attention to the lights initially was the fact they appeared to be moving in a rapid figure 8 type motion.  At first I thought they were flashlights belonging to poaches, however as I stopped my car to watch them I realised they were way too high to be this.  I stopped in my car for around a minute to observe the lights when they appeared to stop as though they were looking back at me.  I definitely could not see a single craft of any sort, but these lights moved with such fluidity and speed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;ve no shame in admitting I became very uneasy; something about the situation just did not feel right.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I travel that road every day around the same time.

I was driving east on Walton Blvd in Auburn Hills just over the bridge, where the neighborhoods start and out of the corner of my eye I looked out my passenger window and thought I saw a cell phone tower with a green light.  It wasn’t a cell tower at all it was one dark shaped but triangular and had a green light, a red light and 3 white light beams pointing in different directions no higher than a cell tower so very close to the ground.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I kept driving and it didn’t move, I made the split second decision to turn around and see if it was still there because I kept telling myself it was something more.  Literally, maybe 1/4 mile or less and this object was way past Lapeer Rd. so far that I had to turn around because there was no way I was going to catch up to this thing (I was going 60mph) and instead of this being so distinctive, it was getting further and further away at a speed that is unrelatable.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Ironically, tonight there are 50mph winds, this was definitely no helicopter and definitely not a plane because this thing was low, I mean the same height as a cell tower.  When I first saw it, it just stayed in one place and by the time I had turned around it was so far in front of me it couldn’t have been a plane because the distanced this thing traveled in a short amount of time maybe 30-45 seconds its impossible and extremely unexplainable.  The picture of this thing is burned into my skull.<n>

I stopped at the 4 way stop intersection and noticed three red lights hovering over a section of houses.  The lights were not evenly spaced but from my view it look like the object was triangular shaped.  The lights were solid, not flashing like an aircraft, and it was too big to be a drone.  As I went through the intersection, the object slowly began to move in the direction of Lake Jackson.  So I u-turned and tried to follow it but lost it as the light went past the top of the tree line.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My first thought was “what the hell is that?”  It was a dark night, because the moon was crescent, but the sky was clear, no clouds.

The sky was a deep cobalt blue with the rapidly approaching night.  I then saw a pair of red lights blinking in rapid succession due west about 50 degrees above the horizon.  The apparent size of the lights was comparable to the apparent size of a star.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The lights moved in a steady fashion and in a slow apparent speed.  They moved forward as if flying side by side from one another (instead of in a line, trailing each other).  The red lights were approximately 15 degrees apart from my vantage point. The distance between the lights did not change during my observation.  The lights blinked in a definite pattern which did not change (left-left.….right-left-right-right……..left-left….right-left-right-right…..in rapid succession.)  The two blinking red lights moved slowly north and then continued off to the northwest until no longer visible at approximately 5:26pm.  There was no sound associated with the lights as far as I can tell.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The relative positions of the lights as they moved gave me the impression that I was witnessing a massive winged aircraft flying silently in the sky, with each blinking red light located at the end of each wing.   However, no aircraft (spacecraft?) assembly was discernable between the two blinking lights.  No other lights were associated with my observation, such as the constant glow of green and red lights one normally sees in civilian aircraft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I, the observer, am a private K-12 tutor with an interest in science.<n>

I ran to the window.  There was a large glowing light in the south west part of the sky above the tree line.  It was moving down at a slight angle very slowly and smoothly.  The light was red, glowing and very large.  It could have been one light or several lights so bright it appeared to be one.  Another witness thought it looked like a fireball.  I went outside and there was no noise.  The light suddenly disappeared.  I only witnessed this for roughly 25 seconds but it was unlike anything I have ever seen.<n>

I just assumed it was an airplane at first.  Then it started shinning what looked like a spot light from the west side of the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first I thought it was an airplane`s landing lights.  Then I realized the spot light was parallel to the ground not on a downward angle like all aircraft landing lights I have ever seen.  This is when I started to get curious to what I was looking at.  From my perspective the object didn&#39;t appear to be moving but I was moving at about 90km/h that may have skewed my perspective.  It remained like this for about two minutes then the spot light quickly and smoothly turned about 90 degrees left from my perspective and was facing North.  About 5 seconds later the bright object and the spot light it was emitting were just gone.  As if someone flipped a switch. I was admittedly startled at this point.  Then my GPS unit began to act up trying to re-route me North adding a long detour to my trip I tried to reset it a couple of times and ended up shutting it off.  I knew where I was going and I knew the routeam I just had it on to track my arival time.<n>

11/23/14 21:00|Anza Borrego State Park|CA|Triangle|4 hours|Numerous UFO's with possibly reversed engineered military craft.|12/5/14|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/115/S115742.html|126|ndxe201411| Numerous UFO&#39;s with possibly reversed engineered military craft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Build up Info:  On Thursday 11-27-2014, I backpacked out of Mountain Palms Springs Primitive camp, within Anza Borrego Desert State Park, San Diego California.    (Mountain Palm Springs Camp is off of Hwy s-2 Sweeny pass;   17.2 miles north from the town of Ocotillo which is at hwy S-2 &amp; interstate 8, zip code 92259).  As the raven flies, Naval Air Facility, El Centro is 31.5 miles from my location.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I stayed in the mountains north near to, and between Mountain Palms Springs &amp; Bow Willow Camp grounds, my camp elevation just over 1600 feet;  (The camp grounds and highway being approximately 300 feet elevation which offered me an expansive view of the sky and surrounding areas).<n> <n><n> <n><n> All the activity occurred the night of 11-28-2014 approximately 1900 to 100.  I am timing by the moon, I knew when it was setting, and it was 34% illuminated.  (I do not wear a watch); I viewed everything with my eye as well as binoculars; (7x35, 420 ft. at 1000  yards, field 8 degrees).  The sky was cloudless, clear calm slight breeze after moon set.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There were numerous UFO lights observed within the first part of the stated time period I will call Phase one.  Phase two, within the mid range time span, I observed what I believe to be Military, yet covert, with more UFO sightings, Phase three similar to second.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Phase one:  Approximately 1930 I started observing strange lights just appearing out of the north north-west sky just above horizon level, travel fairly quick, yet slow enough to follow easily with binoculars going south south-east in a straight line, then curve left (north) and pick up speed upwards towards the skies and just be gone.  Eight of these appeared, minutes after the other, taking about the same general course in the sky, slightly different altitudes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Description:  None of the craft made any sound at all. There were two main dull white large lights separated but parallel to each other, these lights were constant on; with red, some green smaller brighter twinkling lights appearing at fast intervals off to the sides and top of the main white dull lights.  Brighter (yet same sizes as red &amp; green) white twinkling lights would appear slightly away from the main center cluster of other colored lights.  There seemed to be a hazy/wavy blackness surrounding the main lights, the bright twinkling white lights would appear at the outer edges of this wavy blackness.  Which would make this craft large; Note I only had sky no ground size objects to compare or say just what the exact size was.  The hazy-wavy blackness seemed saucer shaped.  Several minutes later another appeared, same lighting, size as the others, this one stopped in the sky at the point where the others had started to speed off upwards,  and stayed completely still for a! bout ten minutes, it was east , eight fingers up from the horizon.   Eventually it very slowly, moved back north where they initially started, slowly making a left to right slalom pattern at the same time, another one appeared from the east headed also north, met the other light they circled around each other, sat still in the sky parallel for several minutes at my low horizon then went fast upwards at a north heading angle; The white dull two lights would twinkle brightly then the crafts moved extremely faster and were gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Phase Two:  Out from the east near El Centro, I heard a very quiet sounding jet noise, similar to loud air. I observed a craft coming my way had similar red and white small twinkling flashing lights as the other craft, it flew towards the west in a straight light between my location and the USA-Mexico border, slightly rising up elevation.  I could just see enough physical shape (no wavy blackness) it was similar to a SR-71 Blackbird as reference. Two large side looking engines on a triangle wing, with a long rocket shape pointed fuselage.  The engines had yellow white lights from the rear; Slight jet sound, but quieter than normal for its length.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Several minutes later, silent craft appeared, same lights as described as UFO in phase one, appeared again from same northern starting point flew east to same west location where black  low noise jet went to. Five craft several minutes after the other, went to low horizon  west south-west  location;  two stayed still in the sky, two slowly moved around, circled each other, stayed in a spot for a few seconds moved to another spot and stayed. They were all fairly clustered together at this time, four fingers above my horizon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After about ten,  fifteen minutes another craft starting from same north low point, flew straight more closer to my location heading south south-east, curved left north and upward at high rate of speed.  This one I easily saw the wavy black cloak, yet all the other lights were visible. As this one disappeared from site, all the other ones which were stationary out west, one by one flew slowly straight the changed upward north following the last craft ! picking up extreme speed until out of sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Another ten minutes later from the initially north location, I observed one single ball dull white light, with smaller flicker bright white and red lights on it, proceed straight south south-east then angle upward at a high rate of speed, the higher it went the faster it went until out of sight. Again, except for the large looking visible black jet, these other objects were completely silent.  As these object sped up, they were obviously much faster than any jet I have seen before, no comparison.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Phase Three:  (I thought I had seen it all).  I heard a low air jet sounding noise again, coming from the El Centro area, for a minute or two. Then I saw a craft coming same flight area as the previous jet, heading straight west slightly angled upwards, between my location and the border.  Initially I saw a single headlight, white, square fairly large, it had smaller lights underneath green at the right, red at the left; a small white at the rear, all on the bottom, making a triangle shape.  Just as it got closer almost parallel to me 5 or six square lights parallel in a row alongside each other with the single light lit up the night sky ahead of the craft;  At this point I could easily see the dull black color, triangle shape of the craft. The front row of square lights was on the straight angle of the triangle, the point end being the rear.   At the bottom center it was cupped inward slightly, the other colored running lights were just outside the cup; in this cupped part w! as a green light that was not lit up.  There was a yellow white large light from the rear point end.  (I thought it odd that the flat part of the triangle was the front section).    Less than two minutes later a quieter sounding black helicopter, took the same flight pattern as the triangle craft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About a half later I observed the triangle craft return at a higher altitude angling up, again between myself and the border, it started angling higher and going faster in a straight line, until it was out of site. Not as fast as when the UFO lights accelerated. As it was flying this time I noticed the white, red and green lights had a brighter twinkle about them (same as the UFO crafts did) yellow-white light at the pointed rear.  It had same quiet sounding hum, air, jet air noise but, not anywhere close to even a small fighter jet, especially for how big the triangle was.       I observed two other UFO lights follow this same course several minutes later, until out of sight, but moved much faster and silent.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then all activity stopped , did not hear or see the jet or the helicopter come back a second time, did not see the UFO’s or Triangle craft the rest of the night, I stayed up for probably another two hours.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About myself, I inspect and repair school buses for occupation; I am a trained experienced animal tracker.  I have been star gazing, backpacking in the wilderness for years; I was a machinist the military.  I feel I have great attention to detail and am more than able to observe and give detailed unbiased accounts of events such as I have just stated here to the best of my ability.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In my opinion, I feel from past observed sighting, when the military is using reversed engineered technology from Alien or Extraterrestrial sources, those Beings know it, and will be close by to observe what is going on, which was the case here, and why there are frequent UFO sightings near military establishments.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thank you for taking this information.<n>

It began traveling very quickly away from us horizontally- headed north.  It slowed down and sped up quickly and made impressive distance in a very short amount of time.  It appeared to also slightly dip and soar upwards smoothly a few times.  I kept my eye on it the entire time it was in view until it got so far away that it became hard to find through the trees.  It was pure white with no blinking lights or anything else that would make me believe it was an airplane or helicopter. Was amazing to see!<n>
11/23/14 18:20|Portland|OR|Unknown|10 minutes|I saw 5 UFOs over Portland, Oregon on November 23, 2014.|11/26/14|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/115/S115623.html|133|ndxe201411| I saw 5 UFOs over Portland, Oregon, on November 23, 2014.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On November 23, 2014, at 6:20 pm I believe I saw an unidentified flying object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My room is seperate from the house.  To get into the house I have to walk up the back deck leading to the back door of the house.  So, on my way into the house from my room I looked up into a pretty dark sky.  Cloudy.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There directly northward were 3 lights.  Pretty big lights.  The shape was indescribable from the distance. I examined them as closely as I could.  They had my attention because the more I looked the more I realized that these are not the airplane or helicopter lights that are commonly seen at night in my SE Portland area near the Sellwood Bridge.  (Which by the way is currently under construction.)<n> <n><n> <n><n> On any night one would have no problem spotting airplanes coming from the south.  More common than ones coming from the north.  I&#39;ve seen as many as 4 helicopters hovering over the city at one time late at night from 11pm and on.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Anyways, there I stood on the deck right outside th! e back door looking at these 3 lights that I noticed moved around very strangely in ways you could not expect from conventional aircraft.  Side to side.  Down, up and in circles.  While it was hard to see the shape I could see they were orange and red in color.  And sometimes just white.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As 2 of the lights slowly began to fade away, 2 more extra bright lights slowly began to appear from the horizon.  They moved higher and higher.  The first 3 had some manner of formation but were definitely independent of each other.  The 2 new bright lights came in formation but then split up as they got closer to the rest.<n> <n><n> <n><n> For a short time all 5 were together before 2 of what I believe were the first set of 3 faded away out of sight.  The 3 remaining did a slow dance.  Unpredictable in nature.  And offbeat.  At least 2 or 3 more times I saw 1 or 2 fade away and another 1 or 2 appear to rise from the horizon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There were too many objects in my vision down lower for me to see where they may be coming from but if I were to guess I would say at least 5 or 6 miles aw! ay.  Probably more, not sure. I shot some shaky video. They only appear to be dots of light on camera.  But, I asked my mother to come look and she watched them for at least a couple minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The entire spectacle lasted about 10 minutes but who knows how long they had been there before I noticed them.  The airport is about 15 miles northeast of where I live. East of where I saw these UFOs.  I live about 15 blocks from the river.  After doing a quick search my mother discovered that there was a UFO sighting earlier the same day in Paris, France.  Sort of similar to what I saw.  I feel like there is more details I should be giving but I&#39;m forgetting.  I called my brother who lives within 2 miles away to look up and see it.  His girlfriend answered the phone and as I was giving my reason for calling they started to fade away.  When I got off the phone they made at least one more brief appearance before disappearing for the last time.  I guess that&#39;s all for now.  I&#39;m working on getting a hold of l! ocal news.

The sun had just set and as we were getting ready to get in our car, my eye was drawn to a bright flame orange object which was rising over the horizon to the north east of us in the just dark sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Over the next 30 seconds or so the object became bigger and brighter as it appeared to get higher in the clear and cloudless sky.  As it got closer to coming overhead of our location it was clear it was not a plane, rocket, helicopter, of ballon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object had no navigation lights, did not blink, was silent, had no contrail, and did not flame out like a meteorite would.  Its speed seemed to accelerate as it headed to the southwest, but was constant in its direction until it disappeared from view.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The most compelling observation the three of us had was its orange constant flame orange color and unusual and possibly changing shape...  We were able to take several photographs which bear out the unique color of the object against the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I consider myself a bit of an aviation and space buff and this was unlike anything I have ever seen.<n>

The weather was abnormally warm for New England in late November.  Hardly any wind and around 50 degrees.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My wife noticed it first.  Moving left to right from the horizon were what looked like orange orb fireballs.  Moving very slow high up in the atmosphere about the size of a ping pong ball if you were holding it in your hand stretched out.  It was like watching meteors entering our atmosphere one by one but in slow motion.  They were travelling very slow.  The formation was way too consistent for it to be a Chinese Lantern.  I would say between 10-15 objects came through then vanished.  My video caught them as you see in most videos but it was nothing compared to the experience.  The video actually picked up more of them coming in real fast then zig zagging out of the atmosphere at speeds I have never seen before.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke via telephone with the witness and he sounded to us to be quite serious-minded and credible.  PD))<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am 39, my wife is 42, and my daughter is 19 and we all were pretty freaked out by the experience.  I have seen nothing in the Dover/Somersworth area on the news, but I do know that 10 miles from my house was the Exeter sighting 30+years ago.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The Dover Police dept did take a few calls similar to mine.

As soon as I did I noticed the object.  At first glance it appeared to be a meteor, but I do not believe it was a meteor.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object was in the NE part of the sky.  It appeared in the sky just above the horizon and was streaking down with a long white trail.  It seemed to move much slower than the average meteor.  Also, the light and size were incredible.  It looked like a bright white sphere.  From my vantage point it was about the size of a softball with a long bright white light trail.  I have never seen anything like it.  It seemed to linger longer than an average meteor in the sky.  This object was so bright.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The light coming from the object was such a bright white light than it reminded me of the led xmas light.  I&#39;m not sure of the exact time of the sighting, but it was between 1AM and 1:10AM.  I&#39;m located on the Playa Vi! sta/Marina del Rey city line.  The object was in the North East part of the sky.  The object became visible to me in the horizon and looked as though it fell to earth. It lasted about 5-6 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I would love to know what I saw???  I do know there was a meteor shower recently, but this did NOT look or act like a meteor.<n>

He says it was medium blue with a white core, and I say it was lime green with a very bright centre. either way, the block only has one light about fifty feet away, and the area around the apartment buildings is VERY unlit, so this thing really lit up the common area in the two seconds it whizzed in a straight line towards lake Michigan at twenty feet above the ground lighting up the area around it, again it was very bright and colourful and it left a &#34;trail&#34; in our eyes  that lasted for a few seconds, kind of like seeing a bright flashlight in a black room.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This was not a meteorite or anything as I saw it fly to an altitude of maybe 150 feet before it dived and went by the window. shooting stars dont change course nor do they fly straight and level (at 20 feet) above the ground.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We both work a lot and were not drinking at the time, we were just playing sky rim when we saw it.<n>

Over the course of a maximum of 4 minutes, it slowly (floating like a lantern) went diagonally up to the right then, at about half way up, it slowly faded then disappeared.  Within less than a minute, another fireball appeared, following the exact same trajectory, then faded.  About a minute later, a third fireball appeared, floated the same path, then faded away.  In total, there were three fireballs within 10 to 15 minutes.  We took a video but it is such poor quality that it doesn&#39;t seem worth sending.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The three observers are mostly novices to astronomy.  Two of the three have, on multiple occasions, seen unidentifiable objects in the sky.  However, they have never seen fireballs before the previously mentioned incident, only round objects which emitted a red light which varied in intensity.  They moved in a way which did not correlate with the current wind direction.<n>

Noticed in the east a star that was changing between red, blue, and silver.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I returned home which was west 15 minutes later, I again went to look up at the star.  What looked like a plane/jet was coming from the east, flew overhead, and proceeded west.  It made no sound.  As I turned to watch it head west, that’s when I noticed another object like it, same size, moving extremely close to it heading east.  Freaked me out because it seemed they were so close.  At the corner of my eye, I then notice what looked like a star moving to the north.  It moved north out of sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I then follow the east moving object and see that it is moving to the star in east that changes colors.  At that time, I then noticed 3 other glowing objects around that star in the east.  The eastward moving object then seems to stop under these other objects and they all just hover there for a few minutes.  Then 2 object heads south and 1 heads southwest.  I went inside to get my telescope, although it is a piece of junk; saw nothing with it.  The objects are still heading in the above direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It all creeped me out so I went inside.  Around 10 minutes later, being curious, I went back outside and in the east the star was still there (don’t know if it maybe it was Venus, but with all this other going on, I wonder) and there were still 3 objects hovering there and then 1 starts going east.  I go back inside and text a friend to look and then go back out possibly 10 minutes later and the sky is cloudy and I can’t see a thing.  Should have reported it to police.  My significant other saw this also.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They had pulsating red lights that moved around in a circle.  There was also a blue light and a small white light on the side of them, but the one that moved north just looked like an ordinary star.  It appeared to go faster than the others.  My significant other said he thought they were going like 100 mph.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Maybe it was military; I don’t know.  I’ve never seen anything like that before.<n>

A friend of mine was following me, so I pulled over and asked her what is that, her and her passenger looked and said what the hell is that,<n> <n><n> <n><n> I then looked around to see if anyone else had witnessed what we was seeing, people in the barbershop was looking, people that was coming out the grocery store was looking and some traffic had stopped and was looking,<n> <n><n> <n><n> I turned back and looked at the objects and called my wife on her cell phone but I kept going to voicemail so I called my daughter and ask where was her mother and to go get her and look out the back window and look at all these UFOs in the sky, she woke up my wife and told her, all I can hear was my wife saying oh s***, what is going on an invasion, now all 15 or 20 of them were in a pyramid formation, I noticed that the last two on the left was coming down and stopped and went back up, they then lined up in a straight line never making a sound, they was changing colors red,orange, yellow and getting brighter they hovered a little more and then slowly moving towards northeast very slow still not making a sound I then started driving home but still looking at them, when I pulled in my driveway and could still see the last two of them and I noticed the last one was getting so bright it looked like it had a ring around the bottom that really kept getting brighter like it was drawing energy from something, it looked like a donut shape or Saturn ring, I went in the house and talked to my wife and daughter and said I&#39;m about to follow them but when I went back outside I didn&#39;t see them anymore,I drove in the direction that they were going still didn&#39;t see them, and then rain just started pouring down instantly, I drove back home and called fox 2 news to report the objects and the news said that they had several calls about that and was waiting on video footage<n>

I pulled to the side of the road where I saw the object creating a rounded V-shape as this object descended at the 45 degree angle.  I took a quite of few pictures of this object when I noticed another object moving in the same direction, same angle as the first object, and moving at the same speed.  The objects left a small trail behind them which dissipated - unlike a chemtrail or a meteor trail.  What caught my attention as being different was the rounded V-shape emitting from the nose to around the object as it move down in a 45 degree angle.<n>

I could not tell if it was self illuminated or being reflected from ground lights as it was dimly lit.  It looked like a soft glow orange or soft white light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This object traveled west to east in a straight line and traveled about a mile from the time I saw it.  Estimated speed was 200 mph.  It reached a certain point and made a perfect 90 degree turn without slowing and proceeded south for about a quarter mile, when it accelerated to an incredible speed, perhaps a thousand mph or more, instantaneously.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It went past the tree line where my view was obscured.<n>

Staring above and to the western sky, I saw what resembled descriptions of the AZ lights.  The difference was the lights I saw seemed so far away that the speed they were exhibiting is indescribable.<n> <n><n> <n><n> These lights were so far away though that if not witnessed continuously would resemble stars.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I kept my head turned upwards, with my gaze staring in a single position, and the lights moved outside of my periphery.  This was my way of determining the lights were moving.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At certain points, there seemed to be 1 to 6 lights illuminated at once.  Then, all but one light would be visible.  Then the lights seemed to illuminate the way a Cuttlefish displays its luminescence.  The semi-circle luminescence moved to the northwest.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Looking at a single point in the far away sky, I would stare at the last point I saw a light, and then the light would disappear, and then the light would reappear at a different point.  I knew it was a different point because I hadn’t moved my gaze and when the light reappeared I had to move my eyes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The lights seemed to at some moments to be in a semi-circular configuration, maybe 4-6 lights, and then they would dissipate to 3, and then just 1 light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At intervals the lights seemed to kind of flash heat lightening, but the “heat lightning” would move quickly like the individual lights did.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I look at the sky often and have never seen anything like this.

The chemtrails were scattered and were positioned and different angles and altitudes.  The color of these chemtrails were an orange and white and the closest one seemed to emit heat.  The number of them increased from 7 to about 13 then up to 20.  Then they disappeared suddenly and without a trace from 20 to 13 to 7 and down to one.  The last one disappeared instantly.  I could not make out what shape the craft in front of the lights were.  They were without movement and the chemtrails never increased or decreased in size.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We suspect that the witness may have observed contrails behind high-altitude aircraft.

The did not leave a trail but you could see fumes/exhaust coming from the back of the craft.  I would describe them as appearing to be bulled shaped.  As traffic moved they went out of my view.

I got up and looked out of the blinds and realized that this ball of white light was moving too slowly to be a comet.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The orb stopped and made slow movements around in the sky.  It was rising and falling, making circular motions.  Most of its movements were slow, but some were really fast.  I watched it out of my window for over an hour.  Sometimes it hovered and looked just like a bright star in one spot for a while, then it moved to the left or right across the sky and then it stopped again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Sometimes when the orb turned I thought I saw some red and green light, but it was mostly bright white light that I could see.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I tried to take a cell phone video of the UFO, but I couldn’t get a good shot of it because it was pretty far up in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When it was getting close to 6:00 a.m., I looked out my window again and it was finally gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It should be noted that I saw a similar UFO a few years ago above Harrisburg, IL.<n> <n><n> <n><n> - A 3L Law Student at SIU<n>
11/21/14 04:00|Hickory Hills|IL|Light|5 minutes|At approximately 3:30AM 11-21-14 my 1 year old grandaughter woke up crying. After getting her comforted and back to sleep (about 4:00AM|12/5/14|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/115/S115813.html|179|ndxe201411| At approximately 3:30AM 11-21-14 my 1 year old grandaughter woke up crying.  After getting her comforted and back to sleep (about 4:00AM), I stepped out on the back porch to have a cigarette. The sky was clear with stars visible.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At that time directly east there were 3  white &#34;stars&#34; of about 1st magnitude arranged in a straight line and evenly spaced and equal brightness.  The axis of the lineup stood vertically above the E horizon just above a neighbor&#39;s house, or on an E-W axis.  I had never seen a formation of stars with a pattern like this and thought it was unusual.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The stars did not move or change brightness exactly like normal stars except that there are no stars  that even remotely resemble that configuration and brightness in that part of the sky at that time.  My husband is an amatuer astronomer and MUFON field investigator and checked the star charts and Stellarium planetarium software.  Whatever they were, they were not stars.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After viewing them for a few minutes, I looked at the sky straight up, and to my surprise another IDENTICAL equidistant straight-line pattern of 3 stars were visible.  They were exactly the same, except they were dimmer at about magnitude 2, but still easy to see. Again, there are no stars known that meet the observation.<n> <n><n> <n><n> During the approximate 5 minutes of observation, both of the configuations just appeared stationary.  But that&#39;s not all.  The SAME CONFIGURATION of three 1st magnitude &#34;psuedo-stars&#34; made another appearance just this morning (12-3-14).  Exactly the same phenomena.  During 5 minutes of observation (clear sky &amp; other stars visible) they just stood there just like stars of magnitude 1 or so.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Tried taking a picture with my cell phone but it didn&#39;t come out.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After 5 minutes had to go back indoors to check on the grandaughter.  At 5 AM went back outside on porch, and the &#34;psuedo-stars&#34; were gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Husband checked CalSky for possible satellite etc but nothing visible that could cause this.<n>

It had white lights at each corner and was moving from northeast to southwest silently.  It went behind a tree and within the few seconds it took me to get to the other side of the driveway and into the alley; I could no longer locate the object.<n>
11/20/14 22:00|Fairbanks|AK|Unknown|30 seconds|Flat platform with intense white, red and blue lights silently hovering only thirty feet or so above a residential area in town.|4/17/15|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/118/S118432.html|183|ndxe201411| Flat platform with intense white, red and blue lights silently hovering only thirty feet or so above a residential area in town.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Driving with a friend on the Steese Highway in town between third street and 10th Ave, we saw a very brightly lit craft hovering only about thirty feet or so above the residential area by the VFW. It caught my eye because the lights were so intense and it was just hovering there almost motionless, but not. At first I thought it was a new street light, but then it moved slightly and the body of the thing was either totally black or invisible.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were stopped at the light on third and Steese and nobody else seemed to see it except for the two of us--(I was going to pull off the road after the intersection but thought the best of it and moved on, so that could have been what others were doing as well, but it just seemed as though people ignored it completely).<n> <n><n> <n><n> I rolled the window down to get a better look and listen to see if it was a  helicopter while thinking of it oddly out of place if it were. I have seldom, if ever seen helicopters hovering that close to rooftops of residential areas before without police and the rest of the gang there; it seemed out of place to me. It was about the size of a large single rotor helicopter though, and either had a flat bottom that held the array of lights, or it was just a flat platform altogether. I did not make out anything above the lights at all, as if it was completely invisible or inky black against the night sky. It made no noise and the platform with the lights was rectangular, but could have been triangular as far as I could tell as I was driving past it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I kept asking my friend to look for the craft itself and describe it to me but he had no explanation and couldn&#39;t see anything above the lights either. Even having his head out the window,to my surprise he still just passed it off as some sort of &#39;military thing&#39;, and paid it little more attention than that.. It tilted slightly and moved a few feet here and there kind of like a bee collecting pollen. I kept glancing at it as I went past, and looked for it in the rear view mirror after it should have come into view.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Oddly enough, that made me start paying attention to the night sky a lot more. I shared my story with a few others just to see if maybe they had seen something similar, or to see if their reactions were similar to how my friend acted. I soon found two others who saw crafts as well, and for some reason both of them also shrugged it off too.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I noticed that much taller and very brilliant street lights started to appear around town less than a week later. The first new street light I saw was at the Ford dealership which was practically the same height and intensity as those on the craft I had seen earlier, but they didn&#39;t span the same area at all, and were clearly stationary lights. Still, my eyes snap to those new lamps because the brilliance is very similar to what was on the craft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Last night, 4/10/15 at around 01:30, I saw another one of those strange crafts hovering over a community just off of Chena Hot Springs Road.  There was a bank of mail boxes coming up on Bias Drive and so this time I pulled over to get a better look. Again, I heard nothing at all and the craft seemed lazily going about it&#39;s business in the same manner as the other one I saw.  This one was moving slowly off towards the Steese and went over the ridge towards town.  I noticed two other people had pulled off the road there as well, and were standing next to a vehicle talking.  I was intent on gaining some higher ground over at nearby Weller School, so we only exchanged eye contact as I pulled away. At the school, there was no sign of the craft at all over the part of the city I could see.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I get the impression that they pose as stars, or sometimes very bright street lights.  I also think that most people refuse to believe that they saw anything unusual, even if they can&#39;t explain what they saw.  I also noticed some similarities between my observations and that of others on this database such as the red, mostly white and blue lights, flat bottom, silent and stealthy aspects, as well as my having heard what seemed like a sonar sound before too while reading late one night--but I didn&#39;t look out the window to see if there was anything there.<n>

Then I noticed there were many of these lights.  They were not blinking.  Once in a while, they would appear to twinkle.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Since I was driving, I couldn&#39;t tell if they were moving or not, so I pulled into a parking lot to watch.  The lights were moving, all to the northeast.  As I watched, more lights appeared from out of the southwest, and moved in the same direction as the other lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> These lights were larger than the size of the planet Venus when it can be seen shining brightly in the sky--probably three times the size.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Once they moved past me, I would lose sight of them, but more and more kept coming.  A plane or helicopter with flashing lights appeared and seemed to be going in a wide circle in the area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After about 10 minutes, no more lights came out of the southwest.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I don&#39;t know exactly how many lights I had seen, but at least 20.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have no idea what these were, and I have not seen any news reports locally about these strange very bright orange/gold lights.<n>

I couldn&#39;t tell if there was 2 objects or just one with two lights. It seems it was one object since the lights moved together perfectly.  The location was parallel to Fenton Rd. heading south, near Grand Blanc Rd in Mundy Twp., Grand Blanc.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first, I thought it was an airplane, since there are many planes near by due to Bishop Airport about 10 miles away.  So, as I am watching this formation it was lower than usual than an airplane would fly in the area, also there wasn&#39;t any sound usually associated with an engine. The lights seemed to float.  When looking at the lights i noticed that at higher elevations, there was an airplane to the north and two more at higher elevation to the south with blinking red and white lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What i saw was completely different, it kind of stunned me, left me thinking, what did i just witness?

I noticed two white lights above a hill.  They looked like headlights.  It was about as high as a cell tower.  I thought it might be for a while because the lights were staying in one place. Something didn’t seem quite right with it. I pointed it out to my sister.  She agreed it didn’t look right. We became transfixed on this light.  It was hard to concentrate on driving.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We rounded a turn and the lights are now on our right.  We’re both staring at these lights suspended above the hill.  We are now about a mile from where we first saw the lights.  Then the object started moving.  It flew over the road to our left an unknown distance in front of us.  We began to feel uneasy.  As it flew over the road something came out of the object.  It looked like a fireball.  It was attached to the object because any move the object made it did too, but it never returned to the object.  The object turned back toward us and flew directly over us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had my window down with my head halfway out the window, and I couldn’t make out any shape to the object.  The radio was off, and I couldn’t hear any sound coming from the object.  I opened the moonroof of the truck and my sister got a very good look at the lights, and she said that she couldn’t make out anything on it either.  It was like it was there, but not.  It’s something that I can’t quite find the words to describe.  I went and turned around at a diner that was right up the road.  When we came back it was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We dismissed it as probably an airplane, and we were overreacting.  We went into town and got what we needed.  On the way back, we used I-79N to Fairmont.  There was a small plane that was trying to line up for landing at the North Central West Virginia Airport.  It flew over the interstate and made a sharp turn similar to that the object made earlier.  This is when the differences in the two became apparent.<n> <n><n> <n><n> One, the plane had a lot more lights than the object had earlier in the night.  The plane had red and green lights that were clearly visible.  Two, the plane was faster than our object.  Finally, the plane’s turn was nothing like our object’s turn.  The plane didn’t have the maneuverability the object did.  When he plane turned it banked to one side.  Whereas, our object stayed on a flat plane the entire time.  The plane went a great distance to make a turn.  Ours made the turn in an instant.  It moved much more gracefully than the plane did.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I don’t know what I saw.  I do know that the object was less than 500 feet above us, and neither of us could make out any shape to the object.  I also know that whatever came out of the object didn’t appear to go back to the object.  I don’t know what it was or if there is physical evidence out there.  There is a public trail over there.  I plan to go out this weekend to search for anything that might have come down.<n>

I filmed over an hour of footage.  The light dims and brightens and moves horizontally and vertically. It&#39;s still there doing the same thing as of 21:00.  It appears to dive toward the ground, then it shoots up in the sky, stalls and moves left to right and in a circular motion.  As if someone is drawing a circle with a flashlight.  I also filmed at least 7 airplanes flying past it within an hours time.  Note that the video does not give good details of the craft, however, you can clearly see the erratic pattern it is flying in.  And you can see the airplanes flying past it (you can tell the planes apart from the craft because of their flight path and strobing light, the object is just flying in all directions).  It almost appears as if someone is flying a kite with a set of lights on it.  The only problem is that flies way to high to be a kit.  It is higher than the airpl! anes flying past it, and it dives down a rockets back to high altitude way too quickly to be a kite.<n>

If I was to guess the length of the object from the front light to the rearward most light, I would say right at 200 feet long.  It was clear out and we could see the stars.  There was wisps of very faint clouds, but nothing that blocked out the stars.  My wife and I continued driving passed our house and down the road looking for it, but we couldn&#39;t find it again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object was traveling at about 40 mph.

Walking dogs, every night. Looked above tree line due to large bright lights coming towards us.  At first, there was a huge triangle of lights, very big and bright.  Then, the form changed into 3 huge, impressive entities. NO SOUND, GLIDING across the sky, at times, hovering very low.  Each of the objects were top to bottom, if you will.  Imagine a long 2 X 4 piece of lumber, the smaller end at the top and the longer part being vertical.  HUGE glowing, impressive bright lights on each one.  After they were side by side, slowly, silently, all 3, one at a time started to leave.  When each one left, alone, it turned ever so slighly as to expose the outline of the object from the lights exposing the magnitude of the size of each one.  Then each one left exactly same way. The most AMAZING sight I have ever seen in my 64 yrs.  4 witnessed<n>

His girlfriend though didn’t see it, it was so unassuming, as I said it looked from our perspective exactly like a streetlight, the same size and color.  It was only after seeing the smoke and flickering fire that I realized it was so much farther away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It should be noted that the object was either directly above the Air force base, or over the inlet past the base.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was absolutely not an aircraft, however, and wasn’t so much flying or floating as just completely still, like a bonfire burning on nothing at all.<n>

I ran back and searched for a plane tracker and saw that there were no planes flying close by.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I grabbed my Ipod and ran back out and took 1 picture and 2 videos.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Through my eye I could barely make the shape of the middle object (they were in a line) and saw that it was a triangular shape.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Also the lead object lit up brightly, about as bright as the moon.<n>

The orange is a very unique orange and is similar to single lights I&#39;ve seen hovering in the sky in the past.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was driving so my view was constantly being obstructed but i got three very good looks at this object.  It would fade out of view like a light bulb being turned off and was only lit or visible for a few seconds at a time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was either five lights in a line or 5 lights fixed onto a round craft.   I could not quite make out the shape.<n>

They were spaced apart with some distance and never got any further than that during the entire time I watched.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I immediately called 2 friends of mine that lived directly in it&#39;s path 6 blocks from me.  I told them just to go out and look upward.  I stayed on the cell while they went out and said they saw them and were astounded. I hung up and  continued to watch as one fell behind the cloud cover.  There were no sounds, no other visible lights, no wings.  They just moved with precision with no sense of urgency.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After I lost sight of them within 5 minutes 2 more oval shaped reddish-orange craft appeared from the same direction, same altitude moving at the same rate of speed.  Again, I watched it as it slowly disappeared.  These 2 moved at a slightly faster speed so I&#39;d say I watched it for 3-4 minutes and it was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I called my friends again and thoroughly discussed this sighting in more detail.  As I told my friends I noticed a lot of air traffic during this event but couldn&#39;t make them out but I can&#39;t say with any certainty that they were military in nature which seem to last for about 30 minutes.<n>

11/18/14 19:35|Los Alamitos|CA|Unknown|4-5 minutes|Hovering orange-red object drops small glowing red balls, then changes into asymetrical object.|1/7/15|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/116/S116264.html|230|ndxe201411| Hovering orange-red object drops small glowing red balls, then changes into asymetrical object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On the evening of November 18, 2014, at about 7:35 PM, I was walking outside my place of work (a business park), and noticed a bright orange-red colored light hovering in the night sky, maybe a half mile away. From the direction it was, it seemed to be in the airspace above the nearby Joint Forces airbase at Los Alamitos.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first I thought the light was a helicopter, as they fly in and around the airbase quite often, day or night. But at this time, I saw no other air traffic going or coming from the airbase.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After maybe 20-30 seconds of watching the hovering red light, which made no noise, as a helicoptwer would have, it began to drop small red balls of glowing light (or a glowing red-hot material?) I thought that this might then be a chinese lantern, but it hovered in one exact spot, not drifting left or right, and dropping about 5-6 of the glowing &#39;red balls&#39; (which dissappeared after falling halfway to the ground).<n> <n><n> <n><n> After 4-5 minutes of observing the above, the &#39;object&#39; or orange red light then went out - but a few moments later, I saw a non-symetrical object there in the same spot in the sky, very dimly lit from the city lights below, which slowly moved in a North-Westerly direction, and seemed to slowly lose altitude. I lost sight of it after 30-40 seconds, as it was too far or low to see clearly anymore, now traveling behind a building and trees across the street from my location.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I also thought the object was a silent drone, but the asymetrical object that I saw at the end of my sighting was definitely not a drone, or a chinese lantern, or any flare - the shape was so strange I can barely even describe it. And the usually busy airbase (helicopters, etc.) was absent of other air traffic before or after the sighting of the object - like they might have been watching it too, and did not want to interact with whatever &#39;it&#39; was (my own guess here, of course).<n>

The dull blue green light looked like you were looking in a window .  It had a depth to it.  The light blinked and slowly moved right to left back and forth in the area of Newark airport .  From my vantage point in Bayonne N.J.  looking west north west towards newark airport I watched it for approximately 27 minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> With a 2 story building 4 feet to my left .  A tree about the same height 42 feet in front of me to the right and at 18 to 20 feet right of the building.  The lights were a foot lower then the tree top.  At one point another light just like it caught my eye coming from north to south.  And it too moved back and forth in the same way, but in a wider pattern to the right of the first one .  The lights looked too close to normal air traffic .<n> <n><n> <n><n> At one point a jet passed in front of it on take off blocking it from my view . I Would have thought they were helic! opters, they do often patrol port newark, but these were different. Didn&#39;t move or look quite the same.  Red light too bright and I never seen a blue green non blinking light.  Very odd looking.<n>

I thought maybe it was an owl, but it was orange hot on the bottom edge.  Then it stopped dead still in the sky, thats when the hair on my neck stood up.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It stopped, and made an immediate change in direction due South for about 1 second, then stopped again, changed direction again and moved East, stopped a third time and then just accelerated incredibly fast South out of sight.

11/17/14 23:20|Jonesboro|AR|Chevron|10 seconds|Silent, dark, fast moving object spotted over Jonesboro, AR.|11/21/14|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/115/S115432.html|241|ndxe201411| Silent, dark, fast moving object spotted over Jonesboro, AR.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was out walking my dog and looking for meteors.  I saw what looked like a faint shimmer above me, really far up in the air.  It was hard to distinguish the shape. It was triangular, but also somewhat of a chevron.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I thought it was a flock of geese at first, but I realized it was moving way too quickly to be geese, and it was completely silent.  The whole event, from me spotting it overhead, to it moving out of sight over neighboring buildings took less than 5 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It looked to be about as high up as a personal airplane, but there were no lights.  I could only distinguish that is was moving because of the fact that is was blocking out starlight as it moved over.  It is a very quiet night and I can easily hear planes and birds at that height.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I could also faintly see what might have been a faint reflection of the streetlights on the underside of the object, but the reflection was irregular, which is why I at first thought that it was a flock of birds of geese.<n>
11/17/14 23:00|Kennesaw|GA|Unknown||Three large white bright lights hovering less than 100 feet above the ground.|11/21/14|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/115/S115455.html|242|ndxe201411| Three large white bright lights hovering less than 100 feet above the ground.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Around 11:00pm on Monday night, I was driving home talking to my wife on the cell phone. I was driving west on Chastain Rd. towards Canton Rd. Just after passing Chastain Meadows, I noticed 3 large, white lights in the sky, apx. 100 feet or less above the ground and probably just 20-30 feet above the trees the lights were above.  The lights were sitting above the trees above the homes that appear to have been built in the 60’s or 70’s on the west side of the Bell’s Ferry if you had turned right onto Bell’s Ferry from the direction I had been driving.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The lights appeared to be apx. 20 feet apart from each other and I noticed a much smaller red light between the left and center white lights.  The red light was also sitting lower than the large white lights.  The lights were not moving or flashing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am very familiar with this intersection and knew that the lights were not coming from a permanent fixture but I could not figure out what it was or see any object or shape from what was creating the lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I drove through the intersection on Chastain, I continued to look to my right and knew it was not normal and I was really seeing something strange. I pulled a u-turn at my first opportunity to go back and get a closer look.  When I got back to the intersection it was no longer at the spot I had seen - it was now over near the Suzuki office in the Chastain Meadows business park. I took a left onto Chastain Meadows and at the point it was gone - I could not see it anywhere.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What initially got my attention was how low and bright the lights were and that they were not moving. Whatever the object was, it was hovering or sitting still for at least 30 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There are several houses right there and I am really tempted to go door to door in that area and ask if anyone saw anything strange. It was just too obvious to ignore. I cannot forget what I saw and I am posting my experience here in hopes that someone else saw it too and will be motivated to say something after reading my experience. After this, I will be much more attentive and conscious of the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I cannot say what it was, perhaps it was some kind of military craft or something along those lines but I do remember the sensation and the confidence I had when I saw it - it was not normal and I had never seen anything like it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I did a quick search and it seems like other people have seen similar things in this exact same area… Thanks<n>

Me and my cousin we returning home from a vaction and only ten minutes away from home witnessed a large strange object traveling above across the interstate.  I noticed it first when and it appeared to be the shape of a triangle.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then as we moved along it appeared more cross like.  Really tried to focus on the object and wish I would have just stoped because we wanted to identify the object.   It was not our luck as well because it was flying so low that after I first noticed it, trees in the intersection we also obscuring our view.  It was a very strange flying object like none I&#39;ve seen before.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As stated before it seemed difficult to actually determine the shape.  The size of the shape was enormous for such a low flying object and was covered with about ten or more white balls of light.  I have never seen as many lights on a plane before so at first I thought it might be some sort of miltary plane that I have never witnessed before, but I do not understand why they would want to be so lit up.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We could see the enormous object through the tops of the trees but it never rize above for a clear enough view.  None of the lights seemed to blink like any other normal plane and almost seemed extra bright white and glowing light.  The object also seemed to be moving extremely slow for such a large low flying aircraft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After the object left sight we continued to search the sky and also stoped off the side of our exit to search the sky again outside of the vehicle.  No sight of the once large, lit up object but we had traveled a few miles to arive at out exit.  We did however notice unusual amount of plane activity where at first there seemed to be four planes flying close together then separate and seemed to just kind of circle the area.  They were very noticeably different from the other flying object but did not seem to be commercial airliners.  I by no means am a aircraft specialist, but h! ave never seen a large, low flying aircraft with so many light! s.<n> <n><n> <n><n> May be a case of mis-identification but I know there were plenty of other cars and people in the area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;ve never reported an incident and only did trying to find anyone who saw the same other object that may have had a different angle and maybe help explain the craft, or possible verify our strange sighting<n>

He came out to me and asked, &#34;What the hell was that?&#34;  He described what he saw as an object with very bright lights flying very low slowly heading south in the neighborhood and stop over where our house is and turn west and take off very fast over top our house and our neighborhood.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We went out back and could see nothing anymore but heard a jet start up on pax naval base.

The speed seemed too slow for how low it appeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then I began to notice the speed was slowing.  It didn&#39;t appear to turn, it just slowed until it came to a stop.  It remained stationary for 10 seconds or so, the began to fade until it just became dark.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I got a video of it on my phone, but it&#39;s just a small light that then turns off, no real detail visible.  At least it&#39;s proof that there was something there.  The night was very clear so I don&#39;t believe there was a cloud or something.  It is the only light in my video so it was the brightest light up there at the time.  I&#39;ve never seen a flying object stop like that...then go dark?  Cool!<n>

I saw a V shaped object.  It was traveling north to south towards SeaTac Airport.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object appeared to be several round balls together to make a V shape.  It was bigger than a star and smaller than the moon.  The object made no sound and had no lights. It was grayish in color.  The object just seemed to glide silently across the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I watched for a couple of minutes till it seemed to be close to the Airport, then it turned into a mist and just disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;m a 50 years old, a stay at home caregiver who never would have thought to be writing a UFO report, but I can&#39;t deny what I saw.   Even if I don&#39;t know exactly what it was.  But I needed to share my experience.<n>
11/16/14 15:30|Gilson|IL|Sphere|20 seconds|Small brown iridescent sphere hovering in front of me while deer hunting.|11/21/14|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/115/S115464.html|267|ndxe201411| Small brown iridescent sphere hovering in front of me while deer hunting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On 11-16-14 at about 3:30 pm, I was deer hunting in central Illinois.  I was facing west on the east side of a wooded draw and the wind was blowing out of the west.  I purposely chose this stand to be down wind of deer traveling the draw.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I saw a small object come down about 4 feet in front of me.  At first I glanced at it and thought it was a spider or some insect.  I stared at this object for a few seconds and realized it was not an insect.  This object was a round ball slightly smaller than a marble with a brownish iridescent color, like motor oil.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This ball hovered in front of me at eye level, about 4 feet directly in front of me.  It was moving up and down and side to side about 6 inches as if it was trying to stay stable in the breeze blowing in my face, but not getting closer to me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I instantly grabbed the seat of my deer stand with my left hand, to keep from falling, and reached out with my right hand to grab the ball.  The ball dropped to about level with my feet staying about 4 feet out and began hovering again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I sat down and the ball rose to above eye level about a foot.  The ball slowly went up and down in front of me and began hovering at eye level again.  I grabbed my seat again and before I could reach, it dropped at a curving angle away from me into the wind.  I lost sight of the ball as it blended in with the leafy ground of the draw.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I could not understand what I had just saw and I tried to explain it away in my mind.  I relized the wind was blowing towards me and it stayed the same distance away from me the entire time, about 20 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am used to seeing spiders, moths etc. while hunting but it was 25 degrees and had been below freezing for several days.  You do not see insects in this weather at all.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This ball had no wings, legs or propellers and it was not natural like a piece of leaf or stick. It just looked like a ball of shiny motor oil hovering without gravity.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I did not see this out of the corner of my eye, I looked at it clearly and close the entire time.  I was very concerned and still am.  This troubles me as I can not think of a logical explanation for this.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke at length via telephone with the witness, and he seemed to us to be quite sincere and sober-minded.  He served as a public employee, in a very responsible position, for approximately two decades.  PD))<n>

Then saw flashes of light through my windows.  I went outside and their was not a cloud in the sky and the temperature was around 60 degrees.  Then something that resembeled a large dragonfly, of a light green color flew past me.  It was practically invisible.  The night before at dusk I saw a yellowish, orangish round object flying parallel and just above the tops of the trees at high speeds, heading south.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Last month at 7:30 pm my daughter and I saw a very bright, white object hovering for 4 seconds and then flew away at very high speeds without a sound.  One week prior at 7:30 pm I saw a white, bright object in the sky moving very slow, then it turned red, then a flash of light and a illuminated cloud or smoke appeared in front of it and it disappeared.  Six years ago I went outside my house at 7:00 am and saw in the eastern sky 3 black bowling shapes in a triangle pattern hovering for about 10 seconds then flew away heading south at very high speeds without sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> All of these occurances happened over Lake Jessimine, near Oakridge road and State Rd. 441.<n>

It looked like a shiny metal marble.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object was low enough for me to see light reflecting on it&#39;s surface.  It was totally silent and moved at a slow speed.  When it got almost directly over my position it made a very smooth and very perfect 90° turn to the north.  Not at all like the turning of an airplane. Just a sudden, very smooth change of direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At this point it was heading away from me so I positioned myself and my girlfriend to where we could see it when it was to pass underneath some very high clouds.  I had a very distinct feeling that it was aware of being watched.  It was at that time that it faded into invisibility.  Not a sudden vanishing but rather a two second fade into thin air going from a solid object to see-through to invisible.<n> <n><n> <n><n> During the entire incident my girlfriend and I didn&#39;t speak a word to one another.  When it was over I asked her to tell me what she just saw and her account was exactly the same as mine.  That in itself lends credibility to the sighting.  @<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness provides no contact information.  PD))<n>

The sky is very spacious here.  It was on a clear night on November the 15 at 9:30 p.m.  I was taking my dog out for a potty walk.  I noticed how beautiful and clear the sky was.  When I noticed some aircraft  that I have never seen before flying low in the sky.  They were bright orange lighting, not flashing, much larger than an airplane.  They resembled the size of a space station that I have seen when it passes over.  They were traveling from east to west across the sky.  About the speed of an airplane.  I could not hear a noise coming from them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was an  airplane in the sky at the same time which I could identify and hear at the same time the other aircraft were out.  It was traveling from south to north.  The other aircraft all traveled about the same distance apart comeing from the same direction.  I counted about seven when I first noticed them.  There could have been more.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I went in the house and notified my daughter and she came out and witnessed them also.  Then we counted about 17 but there were probably more that we didn’t set our eyes on.<n>

I looked up and saw one out of sudden.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I quickly got my phone camera and tried to take a picture but the camera lagged to take a picture.  The single orb I saw seemed to turn because the bright light started to fade out until if looked like a dim star until there was nothing at all.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The orbs seemed to come out strange to me because i knew they weren&#39;t planed;  There weren&#39;t any flashing lights and airplanes don&#39;t flight like that.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This was a solid red light moving eradically.<n>

It appeared to be pulsing or rotating.  It looked more like a flame than a navigation light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then I noticed two more that appeared to be flying in formation with the first. Because of the cloud cover, I could not make out the aircraft that were displaying the lights, but my first thought was that it was a formation of Helicopters.  As they approached, however, I was struck by the lack of any noise.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As the lights were directly overhead, they extinguished.  The lights had been flying SE to NW, but about 30 seconds after they went out, I saw a large, black, triangular object flying (or floating) very slowly moving in a Northerly direction.  It appeared to be about the size of a C-17 at about 400 ft in altitude, but was of a triangular shape.  It was in complete view below the clouds, and I could see the shape perfectly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My first impression was that it was a Stealth Fighter, but after a couple of seconds, I realized that the trailing edge was perfectly smooth, unlike the jagged edge of a Stealth Aircraft.  Add the very slow movement and the complete silence, and I realized that this was like nothing that I have ever seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I watched the object as it flew over my house, and it appeared to be dropping something like a parachute.  At that time, I saw 2 more lights appear from the SE, and they extinguished at about the same point as the others had.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I then saw 2 more of the Black, Triangular objects on the same flight path as the first one.  I lost sight of them as they flew over my house.<n> <n><n> <n><n> From the time that I saw the first lights to the time that I saw the third object fly over my house, was about 4 to 5 minutes in duration.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness has been known to our Center for over 15 years.

Out of the 20, there were three far behind them traveling in the same pattern.  Two were together with the third coming up from behind.

The orientation was if they had launched 3 rockets one right after another.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first I just thought maybe it was a launch from nasal at Wallops Island.  However, the launch pad at Wallops launch pad was destroyed a few weeks ago when the rocket exploded.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We watched and tried to video it but you can&#39;t really tell anything on the video.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After they reached a very high altitude the &#34;fire&#34; went out but we could still kind of see them.

While I drove through Santee, (52 freeway headed west ), I noticed what looked like liquid fire hanging from what appeared to be a stationary light, (looked like a star only this was not that high off the ground).<n> <n><n> <n><n> I grabbed my friends arm made sure she saw it too.  (We couldn&#39;t come up with anything to explain what we were seeing)  There was a light in the sky, not moving, and hanging off of that light was a large drop of fire (if that makes any sense).  It stretched until it broke free and then fell towards the ground.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then more fire replaced that fire but this time in much smaller drops that fell quicker and in groups as well as by themselves.  It was so weird.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I got onto the 125 I was facing the action again for a brief moment and even though I figured it was over I not only saw more fire falling from that light, I also now saw! fire globs dropping off of nothing.  At least I couldn&#39;t see the fire attached to any light or any other object.....probably the weirdest and most undeniable strange event I have ever witnessed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We saw the event up close and for a relatively long time-in other words there is no way I am mistaken about what I saw....no mind playing tricks on me or optical illusions either.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This occurred early this morning in Santee, Ca, where I was fortunate enough to be able to witness a good portion of it as it happened.

The entire observation lasted between 8 and 10 seconds, the time it took to appear in the north and disappear in the south.  The sky was clear of any cloud.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object consisted of five lights that were forming a pentagon shape (flat surface).  Each light was the size of a bright star.  The object was moving along a mostly-but-not-quite rectilinear trajectory.  The shape appeared to be “surfing” in the air as it was swaying on various axes.  It also appeared as if there was no unifying body between the lights, although the movement contradicted this observation (see below).  It is important to highlight the fact that the movement was the most intriguing characteristic of this observation.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The distance was estimated to be anywhere between three to ten miles.  Despite the distance, the object appeared to be extremely large (approx. 3-5 degrees) - the size of one to four football fields perhaps.  It was probably travelling at an altitude of 10K to 30K feet. It could have been bigger and farther too.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I immediately tried to point the object to my wife, but the dog started barking at nearby walkers.  I kept pointing and telling her to watch, but she was trying to keep the dog under control.  The object disappeared and I was  frustrated that she hadn’t seen anything.  As I tried to describe her what I had just witnessed, she first made fun of me and then suggested commercial planes or jet planes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The fact that the shape was clearly swaying over multiple axis while travelling at a near constant speed implied that some of the lights were accelerating while others were decelerating.  This movement would have been virtually impossible to create if they were not part of the same body.  I cannot think of any human-built object of this size that could travel at such speed and not suffer incredible air pressure.  I also cannot see how a flight formation could produce such perfect movement given the speed differentials that would be involved.<n>

It was rectangle in shape and was black.  It had 5 lights on the front resembling that of high beams, but were blinking like hazard lights but in an alternating fashion.  There were 2 red lights on the outside and 3 white lights in the middle.  The white lights were the main lights blinking, almost like search lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object flew in an upright position so that when it flew over me I could see its underside which was rectangle shaped as well.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The more extraordinary part about this sighting is that I could also hear the object.  It made a light whooshing sound that was softer than that of a plane and kept the same tone.  It was a calming sound like that of ocean waves and I live nowhere near a large body of water capable of producing such a sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It also was lower than any plane I&#39;ve ever seen before.  The object came rig! ht out of the clouds in front of me as I was driving on a residential road near my home.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Seeing the object prompted me to pull over and get out of my car to witness this immaculate event.   The object literally flew right over me allowing to give such specific details.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After this experience was over I got back in my car and pulled off.  As I got on a nearby highway I was able to see the object once again as it faded off into the clouds once more and was at a higher position in the sky than before when it was right over me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This was one of the most shocking events I&#39;ve seen.  To actually experience what I&#39;ve only heard people speculate about and document encounters about is beyond any word I could use to describe.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Truly freaky and bewildering.  I hardly know what to think.<n>

11/14/14 17:45|Allentown|PA|Formation|20+ minutes|Formation of 10+ white/red lights moving & then stationary on 11/14/14 at 5:45 PM approached by light aircraft near Allentown Pa.|11/21/14|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/115/S115377.html|317|ndxe201411| Formation of 10+ white/red lights moving &amp; then stationary on 11/14/14 at 5:45 PM approached by light aircraft near Allentown, Pa..<n> <n><n> <n><n> My wife and I live between Allentown and Emmaus, Pa., in a residential area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Last evening, Nov.14, 2014, at 5:45 PM, while departing our house to dine with another couple, we spotted approx. 10 white lights in an up-side down &#34;V&#34; formation which were moving slowly towards us (Northern direction) in the Southern sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After several minutes they stopped movement.  The formation consisted of three lights on the left leg, one light on the point and six lights on the right leg.  All were  bright white/red.  My wife remembers them as being red.  I believe they were white with red in the central area.  They did become almost all red.  They appeared as very slightly flickering but that might&#39;ve been due to the  atmospheric conditions.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;d guess the brightness was that of a car&#39;s headlight from two miles away.  Altitude was unknown and we estimated their location above as between Emmaus and Hellertown, Pa., and several miles from us. they were brighter than any star or planet.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Shortly after stopping the three lights on the left leg started an upward movement and faded becoming mostly red in color.  They might have went into a cloud but I could not see (the cloud). I thought they might be helicopters however we didn&#39;t detect any sound.  After the three faded away we heard and saw a one engine light aircraft  to our right coming out of the East and heading in a Westerly direction on an intersecting pattern with the lights.  I&#39;d estimate the aircraft&#39;s altitude was approx. 2,000 ft.  There is a small airport less than two miles from our house.  At the same time three very bright white lights appeared below and farther out (South).  They appeared to be moving to meet the lights that were stationary.  They could&#39;ve been the three lights that were in the left leg that climbed and faded away and were returning.  The skies were clear with few spotty clouds that were illuminated by ground lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Meanwhile each light took turns becoming brighter as a landing light would appear.  No distinct pattern was seen.  The two leading lights in the right leg came closer together almost touching and their color  became more red than white.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The aircraft appeared to be very close to the unidentified lights and crossed in front of them.  By then the engine sound of the light aircraft faded away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The four lights remained stationary so we entered our car and drove in a Southernly direction to meet our friends who were about three miles from our house.  A Norfolk Southern freight train passed us 150 ft. to our left (Lehigh Line to Reading and Harrisburg).  The track elevation rises as the line enters Emmaus,Pa.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After stopping for a series of signal lights, I saw four lights appear just above but farther out than the train.  This would be in my 10 o&#39;clock position.  While noticing they were yellow, three additional lights appeared to their right (my left).  These were a bright and deeper amber color.  All the lights were considerably larger than our first sighting but could&#39;ve been the same lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;m a military veteran and they resembled flares but no smoke emitting from them and they were stationary.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Our road dropped in elevation and between that and the moving freight train we could no longer see the lights.  The time was about 6: 10 PM.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am retired and have excellent eye sight with glasses used for reading and have been a lifetime aviation enthusiast.  The lights were not any type of aircraft or flares.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Today I stopped at our small airport and they indicated they have not heard about the sighting and they close around 6 PM.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Lehigh Valley Airport (ABE) is about 8 to 10 miles from our house and I&#39;m sure they would&#39;ve warned that light aircraft about the light objects if in fact they appeared on their radar.  We were very surprised the aircraft headed directly towards the lights and came very close.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Well over 100,000 people live in this very spread out area, which includes Allentown, Emmaus, Bethlehem and other small towns.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Pa. Rt. 309 joins with Interstate 78 and both are very heavily traveled plus it was Friday night at rush hour.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The lights had to be seen by many people.<n>

We watched it for about 30 seconds from noticing it, then it just disappeared.  This was seen over Hopkins, MN.<n>
11/14/14 14:15|Chandler|AZ|Cylinder|5 minutes|I witnessed a black, cylinder-shaped UFO in Phoenix, Arizona.|11/21/14|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/115/S115404.html|319|ndxe201411| I witnessed a black, cylinder-shaped UFO in Phoenix, Arizona.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On 11/14/2014 at 2:15 pm, I witnessed a black cylinder shaped object floating in the sky at the Interstate-10 entrance on Chandler Blvd. in Arizona.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I did not have a chance to pull over and study it very closely because I was waiting to turn left at a red light.  From inside my car it appeared to be about 1 to 2 feet in length and it was vertical.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was about to turn left (west) on the I-10 freeway when I noticed the object in the North sky sitting low and motionless above oncoming traffic.  It was definitely not a balloon.  It was low enough to tell there were no strings attached and the object looked really solid.  That is, it wasn’t bobbing or weaving like a balloon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first I thought it might have been a drone but there were no propellers or wings.  There were no lights on it that I could see.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I couldn’t tell if it was making any kind of sound because I was in the car.  There were no streetlights or power lines near it so it couldn’t have been attached to anything.  However, there was a street light about 20 yards in front of it and it appeared to be hovering at about the same height, maybe a little higher.<n> <n><n> <n><n> No one else seemed to notice it.  That is, no one pulled over to take a closer look.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Was this a drone? Has anyone seen something similar or am I going crazy? I’ll check again tomorrow on my way home from work to see if it’s still there. Although I doubt it, I drive the same route every day and this was the first time I’ve ever seen something like this.<n> <n><n> <n><n> P.S. My mom has had multiple UFO encounters over the years. I’m in my 30’s and this is the first experience I have ever had. I’m usually the smug skeptic that rolls her eyes at these sorts of stories. Maybe I should change my tune. &amp;#61514;<n>

11/14/14 02:45|Sacaton|AZ|Fireball|2-3 seconds|Bright green fireball and tail falling toward the ground.|11/14/14|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/115/S115345.html|321|ndxe201411| Bright green fireball and tail falling toward the ground.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I witnessed a bright green fireball falling almost straight down, trailing a bright green trail while driving east on I-10 between Sacaton, AZ, and Casa Grande, AZ, at around 2:45 am.  It was a quick 1 or 2 second sight before it went behind a small mountain I was driving past. I work nights so I was fully awake and aware at the time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I would write it off as a spectacular green falling star except I had seen this same thing back in 2007.  In 2007, I was driving south on I-25 just south of the CO &amp; NM state line when I witnessed the same event.  The only difference was that in 2007, the area was completely open ranch land with rolling hills.  As I approached the area I thought it had gone to ground, I witnessed a green glow in the pre-dawn sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After I got closer, I realized the bright green ball of light or fire was hovering around 30-40 ft above the ground.  It had a conical shape light extending from the green ball to the ground that reminded me of a street lamp shining on the ground.  I&#39;m not positive, but I believe the cone shaped light was not green but white or yellow.  As I came over the last hill to where the green ball and cone light were, where I intended to try to photograph with my cell phone, it had disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Unfortunately the green ball &amp; tail I observed last night went down behind that small mountain so I did not see if it hovered as it did the previous time.  I do know that there were a few houses or small ranches in the area, as well as other traffic driving both directions on I-10 so there is a good chance someone else may have observed this event.<n>

And we were driving and looked up and about 150 ft above us was a gray circular object and we were lookin at the bottom of it which had several flashing lights on it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We slammed on the brakes and as soon as we stopped the ship disappeared.<n>

When I saw something moving, I thought it was an airplane but since it doesn&#39;t have the classic lights of an airplane I start looking at it more carefully.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I saw it in the air.  The light intercity was the same as star in the night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> But it was moving across the air, due to the intensity of light, I could notice that it was far, but the most relevant thing was the speed.  I never seen something moving that fast in the air.  It wasn&#39;t a comer or something.  It was a light.  And then it suddenly disappear in the middle of the air.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.  PD))<n>

I mean in a matter of a split second it was there and then it was gone.  I would have to say it was a couple of hundred feet above my neighbor’s house if that.  It was really low and it had me standing there gapping at the spot it appeared then disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I stood there staring at the spot where it was for several seconds and nothing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I honestly can’t explain it as anything but a UFO, it was so surreal.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date is approximate.

It was dark out, so it was easier to see 2 of the 3 lights but when I got a better look at the unidentified object the 3rd light was behind my tree.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I went to go get my camera and turn it gone I looked to see if it was there it was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  No time was indicated by the source of the report.

Hovered quietly above park trees, I walked around corner from my house and it made a quick dart away from me, headed west, then another quick dart south and suddenly went up higher and headed west, where it just disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object made no noise and I would have regarded it as a toy drone, but the speed, the quick ascent and the brisk disappearance could not be done by a drone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Fast planes pass by my neighborhood and I can track them for miles.  Hot air balloons are seeing frequently and these do not have speed capabilities.  Holiday balloons can be tracked and often easy to track their landing once the little fire dissipates.  This object did not move like anything I have ever seen.<n>

She directed my eyes upward to the night sky looking east.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I looked up I saw three glowing red lights spaced a distance apart but maneuvered as one giant unit.  The lights appeared in an obtuse triangle shape.  The object was at about a 45 degree angle from my point of standing to the lit objects location in the sky.  The glowing circular red lights were each just slightly bigger than a large glowing star in size but the whole object would cover just under the size of a typical South Dakota November full moon (assuming by movement these were all one large object and not three separate moving simultaneously.)<n> <n><n> <n><n> It appeared to glide through the sky.  In about a sixteen second time frame it moved south-southwest approximately 6 inches from where it began to where the lights just vanished.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was moving in a very slight angle, under 5 degrees from start to vanishing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke via telephone with the witness and found her to be quite eloquent and sober-minded.<n>

So about 2 minutes later the one that was further out showed a real big bright white light and started moving in a fast pace towards the other that was just in a stand still once it got close, that&#39;s when the red light started moving away while the other stood still 3 minutes later the white light slowly started going in the apposite direction until it disappeared.<n>
11/13/14 18:25|Norwalk|CA|Sphere|2 minutes|3 witnesses reported 2 speeding helicopters chasing a white orb northbound over Norwalk, CA.|11/14/14|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/115/S115335.html|330|ndxe201411| 3 witnesses reported 2 speeding helicopters chasing a white orb northbound over Norwalk, CA.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Seemed to have been a military operation involving 2 helicopters flying really low overhead the 605 freeway.  The two helicopters were chasing a white orb.  All 3 craft were really close to each other, about 100-200 feet separate making a triangle formation with the orb leading.  All craft were heading north bound.<n>

I&#39;ll be the first to call most &#34;sightings&#34; a big pile of bologna. But this report, is entirely accurate. This report, I saw with my own eyes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Let me get started by explaining the &#34;sighting&#34; in its entirety. It was just before sunset, I was facing east looking toward a tree line.  Out of my peripheral vision I noticed 4-5 orange glowing &#34;orbs&#34; in the cloud line.  They seemed to be moving in some type of formation, appearing and reappearing at will.  They &#34;danced&#34; around in what I would describe as a figure eight like motion for the majority of the time I was able to see them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> One of the &#34;orbs&#34; shot across the entire sky until no longer visible, followed by the remaining anomalies at an alarming rate of speed.  They were there, and then they were just gone.  No sound, no reflection , no nothing, just gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Ok, so no big deal right?  Unless I were to take you back to my childhood, in which I saw the exact same type of anomaly, but not yet old enough to understand the difference.  I would not have even thought to much about it, had it not been for a Youtube.com video I recently viewed, depicting the exact same experience I have mentioned here.<n>

It was grey in color with a red stripe, it had red lights on the rear fins.  It was less than 100 feet off the ground hovering in mid air.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We watched it for around 2-3 minutes and then continued down the road.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;m not sure if it is related but as a side note 2 air force officers showed up in my small town at the funeral home today.  When no one answered they came across the street to my house and looked in the window.  I was out of the line of sight but saw their shadows. The proceeded across the street to a auto shop,  I went over and talked to the men at the shop and they confirmed they were air force.  They claimed their cell phones had died and were trying to get a hold of the funeral home.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A gentlemen at the shop confirmed their had been a burial at the cemetery in town today. So I&#39;m not saying it&#39;s related just odd 2 air force officers show up the next day in a town of a little more than 1000.<n>

No noise but I was inside my car with windows rolled up.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The way it was flying was very strange because the wings were moving in a way that looked like it was floating.

I was looking to the northeast.  I suddenly saw a small red/orange round light make a very tight and fast clockwise circle in the sky.  I lost sight of it for a moment, but then it reappeared for a moment, and then shot either straight up or toward me at an angle.  From my perspective, it was well above treetop level, higher than usual fireworks seen during celebrations.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I let out a couple of yelps of, “hey hey,” to see if any of my other neighbors were out so that I could draw their attention to what I was watching so that I was not the only witness.  I received no response from my neighbors, but stayed out to see if I could spot the light again, but saw nothing.<n>

Suddenly, large white lights (balls) appeared in a circular formation.  The lights danced around and then went back to a large circular formation.  It began to slowly move away and I followed it almost to the next town (Lexington) after approx.  7-8 minutes beams of light came down from each ball of light.  Object was larger than all homes in route at leaste the size of a football field.  I saw other drivers brake and appear to notice it.  I tried my cells cam but of course it did not pick up anything.  Object was silent.  It just was there and gone,  Very strange.  The light beams that came down would move around the ground,  Become one and back to seperate beams of lights .<n>

I figured they were airplanes queued up for landing except I realized they were stationary.  They were not stars as they were flickering with high level of clarity as opposed to the way one would see a distant star flicker.  I noticed two of the lights were in sync so I figured then that maybe it was a tower that I just had never noticed before until other lights started to appear.  Some were moving very slowly.  Slow enough to be helicopters drifting as they hovered, but there was no sound and then more appeared.  Some disappeared and the two that were in sync went out of sync.  I noticed a total of about 10 lights.  I used my binoculars to see what I could but could only really make out balls of light as it was dark.  I did notice that at least one light was reddish while the others were mostly white.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I went to get my wife to look and by the time she came out, the lights had gone from about 10 back to 2 and then a few planes came through the area and the lights disappeared.<n>

The sun was just setting and no other stars were visible.The &#34;stars&#34; were next to each other, very close together and I thought it was very odd for two planets to be in such perfect alignment and so close together.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They were not moving for several minutes, but thenbegan to move away from each other so slowly it was almost imperceptible.  One went northwest and one went southeast. They were moving far more slowly than any plane I&#39;ve ever seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After a minute or two they just blinked off, as though someone flupped a light switch and nothing could be seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Less than an hour later I saw another bright, unmoving light in the sky, behind my house this time. It looked identical to the first but lower in the sky.  It was still for about two minutes then it dimmed.  It was still visible but smaller and not ! as bright, like a regular star instead of a planet.  It then begam to move, faster than the first two but still slower than a plane.  Then it turmed red and started to blink, still moving.  I watched it for a minute then it just turned off just like the first two.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I dont know what background info about me you would like, but I am a 35 year old white female, with a BSN in nursing.  I was not under the influence of any drugs or alcohol.<n>

It was particularly odd in that it looked almost exactly like a great big automobile headlight – perfectly round ball of light, encased in thin outer layer of shiny, silver colored metal.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Likewise, there was no vapor trail of any sort behind the craft.  In terms of size, it was about double or triple the size of a typical airline jet seen in the sky from a similar ground vantage point.<n>

Usually what I see can have at least a plausible explanation.  I have nothing for this sighting.  All about details in this description which will be lengthy.  But I want to document everything I can remember while fresh.  All ‘measurements’ will be between 2 fingers at arm&#39;s length.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Temp 14 degrees.  Unusual for November 12th 2014.  Skies clear blue overhead.  Very low  thick cloud banks to the north about 1.5 inches high.  Some spotty clouds to the west low.  Sun starting to set.  Had also observed a small sun pillar sometime between 4:45 and 5:10.  Unsure when.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Traveling between Clarks and Central City on HWY 30 southwest bound very close to 5 pm as I saw 1st anomaly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A white streak appeared about 24” from the horizon (see previous measurement scale).  The streak resembled a jet trail (straight) about 1.5” in length appearing at the 10 to 4 position in the sky(relative to a clock sitting on the western horizon).  I thought I should’ve seen this before and concentrated on it.   Solid for 10 seconds.  Then faded within 1 second disappeared.  I immediately thought I had seen a meteor trail.  Cool I thought.  (I have seen a few before in the daylight).    Then another one appeared within 15 seconds.  (close to and about the same size as the first.  A little more north I’d guess and maybe slightly higher).  Watched it the same with the same result in 10 seconds as the first.  Still convinced I saw another meteor trail.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Within a few minutes, I noticed the first light orb in the same area.  A little larger than venus and about 2 to 3 times as bright.  The light was NOT white like venus, but reminded me of a flashlight.  Yellow/white.   About 15 seconds I watched that.  And it slowly faded to NOTHING in 1 second.   Still my mind convinced myself it was a plane reflection.  I have seen many reflections that have caught my eye.  But this one was different.  What was different was I could ALWAYS see a plane AFTER the reflection.  There was nothing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I was younger, I would hear and watch fighter jets training in NE Nebraska on clear days.  Usually on a Saturday.  And would watch them ‘dog fight’ as they puked out flares (that would arc and burn and leave a trail that would last for 5 minutes) and did their maneuvers.   Was always cool to watch.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I kept trying to convince myself that HAD to be it.   But nothing quite fit.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then I saw the next one.  Just as bright.  Not appearing to move much as the first one did.  Again 15 seconds … nice and bright then faded within one second.  No plane.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is about the time I knew what I saw…. DID NOT make any sense.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I saw another one in the same area about 1 minute later.   Nice and bright.  Then I saw the second one appear to the left and a bit higher 3” from the first bright one.  Now I see two at once.  Not changing the distance between them.  The bright one to the bottom right and the dimmer one to the top left.  After 15 seconds… the lights faded within one second and disappeared.  No planes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Just before Central City, I pulled off on a gravel road.  I put some electrical lines between me and the area I was watching.  (all this is higher and to the left side of the setting sun).  I waited about 3 minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> For the last time, I saw a light orb.  Nice and bright it appeared.   From my viewpoint AND with the power lines for reference.  It drifted UP from my viewpoint about 3”  (this could be moving closer to me OR could be moving up OR could be moving higher and away from me).  The light faded as all the others.  No plane.   That was the last strange thing I saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The light either had to be a reflection of the setting sun or made its’ own light.  But I saw NO objects in the air.  No idea about why the trails and the light stayed visible to me about the same amount of time and faded from clear view to nothing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> TK<n>

They were whispy with different shades of purple shadowed across.  I was looking at a very thin cloud shape directly in front of my line of vision.  Of course, I had to pay attention to my driving, but I was mesmerized by the cloud.  It had strange purple hues and I thought it was beautiful.<n> <n><n> <n><n> All of a sudden, the cloud disappeared and 8 spherical shapes appeared in the sky.  They appeared in a check mark against the sky.  They were impossibly close to each other, and I immediately looked for a trail of any kind in the sky.  I thought maybe somebody was shooting off fireworks.  There was no visible trail, and I stared as each suddenly burst into a blinding crystal-like light.  It was as if they all were encased in diamonds and the sun suddenly hit them.  Then they were gone. In a flash, all 8 disappeared and the cloud that I had seen before was replaced by a slight mist.  This mist became just a thin trail left behind of what I had seen.  It was not the magnificent purple-hued cloud that had fascinated me at first.  It was a thin veil of white smoke left in the wake and only a pattern of the spacecraft I had just witnessed.<n>

Looked in the sky and saw one huge object with about 6 green circular lights and a centered red light above the green lights.  The green lights were so pretty.  The object was traveling northeast.  I saw the object from the back. In about seconds the object seem like it was 10 miles away.  I saw it make a sharp left turn at a slow pace then gradually speed up and instantly came to a stop.  The object did not tilt while turning.  Then made a super fast right turn at an alarming speed not seen before and fell down.  It popped back up, took off, then disappeared before my eyes<n>

They&#39;re all small lights that seem to be blinking/flickering different colors but still very bright and visible.  They&#39;re all moving very quickly and the same way, moving in circles, stopping and taking off swiftly in a completely different direction.  They seem to stay in the same general area just bounce and fly around that area in many directions, going to the right, stopping, going up, stopping and taking off to the left then swiftly downward and stopping, almost like a bug would around a light.  They seem to be up pretty high so I can&#39;t exactly make them out but if there&#39;s an investigator looking for a hot spot then I&#39;d say this is it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They come every night so far and at opposite times but lately they have come in groups<n>

The thing was going well over 10x the speed of a plane and was a very bright round light.  It appeared to be around 30,000 feet above sea level and I only saw it for around 3 seconds.  This thing did not make any sound what so ever and was definitely not man made.  I looked up google maps to see where it was headed and it was going in the exact direction of the Florida Keys, where a lot of people have seen them fly into the water.  If I had to guess how fast it was going I would say around 2,000-10,000mph and would have to say it was going to their base underground in the water by the keys.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was on the back porch looking at the pond when it came from over the house to beyond the houses past the pond.

It then looked like the triangle turned in the sky, as one bottom light eclipsed the other.. then one by one, the lights slowly disappeared until one remained and that slowly faded away.

Those 3 lights separated slowly away from each other and disappeared.  Behind those lights came several others in groups of 4 to 6 or so.  They all seemed to be 300 to 400 feet off of the ground and about 100 yards apart.  All flying in a row, one behind the other at about 30 to 50 mph? , running parallel to Rt 125 North.  A couple of the lights caught up to the lights ahead of them and flew beside them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I drove south on Rt 125 and parked in front of Stewarts Green Houses were I could see more lights coming from the east, over the tree line across the street near Salmon Falls Road.  I watched the lights that kept coming in single file and flying along the side of Rt 125 North bound towards where they were first seen over Loan Oak Ice Cream.  I saw 35 to 40 or so total, in an 8 minute span between 5:00 pm and 5:08 pm.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When it looked like there were no more coming, I pulled out on to Rt 125 heading South, I looked over again toward the tree line and saw about 3 more appear, then I continued driving on my way home.<n>

11/11/14 11:00|Abu Dhabi||Disk|3-5 seconds|From a high-rise hotel in Abu Dhabi three eliptical/saucer-shaped UFO's are in 1 photo of many taken (11/11/14).|12/5/14|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/115/S115737.html|363|ndxe201411| From a high-rise hotel in Abu Dhabi three eliptical/saucer-shaped UFO&#39;s are in 1 photo of many taken (11/11/14).<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  This report was submitted by a party, who is well known in the UFO field, but who, for the sake of his wife&#39;s anonymity, prefers not to be identified.  We extend our gratitude to both parties for their having shared the information, and the photo, with our Center.  PD))<n> <n><n> <n><n> The relative of mine who took the photo departed for Abu Dhabi on November 10.  The attached photo was probably taken the morning of November 11th but I will try to confirm that.  Possibly (but less likely) it was Nov 11.  She returned to the U.S. on Nov. 14.<n> <n><n> <n><n> She took it from her hotel room in a high-rise building.  Judging by the shadows of the buildings I think it&#39;s a morning shot so I have written down 11:00 but will try to confirm this later.  She was clicking off photos at the rate of about one every few seconds and the UFO&#39;s are not in any of the other shots so I listed the duration of event as 3-5 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What I see in this photo is this:  1.  Three elliptical objects, saucer shaped.  They seem to have some detail within each elipse - these do not seem to be solid metal objects with totally uniform surface texture.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 2.  When you blow up the photo on your desktop screen, to the right of the left-most object you will see perhaps as many as 5 of what seem to be distant groupings of 2 or 3 UFO&#39;s in each group.  So there may be 13 or 14 UFO&#39;s in this image in all, but I listed it as a 3-UFO event because there are 3 that are seen most clearly.  Clearly something cause the seemingly more distant and smaller UFO images in the photo too so it would seem there must have been more than the 3 very apparent objects.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 3.  There is not a cloud in the sky - these are certainly not clouds based on their shape and the rest of the sky - they do not have any bird-like shape (and birds would have appeared in the other photos she took also) - and this does not have a characteristic of lens flare at all.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Of course one has to ask, because this was taken from a hotel room, and therefore through a window (glass), could they be reflections, for instance of lights in the room?  Seems impossible because there is no trace of any other characteristic of reflection, no hint of any other object &#34;in the room&#34;.  Also unlikely lights were on in the room with this much daylight streaming in, and if these were reflections of lamps then they should have shown up in the other photos also.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The anomalies were not seen by the person who took the photo while she took it.  It was noticed later while looking at the photos.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  ANALYSIS--At first glance, our suspicion was that the oval-shaped objects might have been reflections of ceiling lights in the room behind the photographer, who took the photo through the window of a hotel room.  However, the source does not believe that to be the case, given that the other photos do not show the same images.  PD))<n>

They were parallel to each other, left and right, and completely level with one another.  As they appeared to grow closer, the left-to-right space between them increased  but they always remained level to one another.  once they became about 5-6 thumbs apart at arm&#39;s length, a sparkling light departed from them.  it looked like a firework with multi-colored sparkling lights in constant and consistent intensity and activity. red, blue, green, white.  sparkling and lively. it traveled off to the south with a steady and constant speed/trajectory.<n> <n><n> <n><n> afterwards,  the two lights (star-like. if only gazing up quickly one would never realize their position was changing) seemed to back up, becoming more distant.  i said to them &#34;what is your intention&#34; over and over again.  i never saw the shimmering light again.  the two &#34;stars&#34; never deviated from their relate position to one another.<n>

I was heading North bound onto 309 when a bright light appeared in the sky to the West.  The light was bright white, no color at all. It was bigger then any aircraft I have ever seen by 10 times at least.  If an airplane was a quarter, the light I saw was about the size of a lid from a quart of paint.  The shape was not round nor square, but seemed to change slightly back and forth, as I watched.  The road did not have a turnout to pull over safely so I drove on.  As I watched the light it followed my pace for about 3/4 mile and then slowly headed north east over my head and out of sight.<n>

My rout home takes me through the top part of Irvington neighborhood.  The very first thing I noticed was flying very low, like a helicopter and was very loud.  But it did not look or sound like a helicopter. It had very bright red lights on top that were glowy and vibrant.  White lights on bottom.  It was moving fast and I followed it for a couple blocks out of my direction and it disappeared from my sight behind houses.  I allowed it to get away and continued biking home.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Once I reached the very top of the hill near Alameda, I decided to stop because it&#39;s a good place to see the sky.  I wasn&#39;t assuming I had seen anything extraterrestrial, more that it was truly bizarre.  I was only standing at the top of the hill for less than a minute when straight ahead of me (facing south) I saw a very, very bright light.  I thought it was a satellite. It was staying in one place and not seeming to move at all.  It was s! haped like a hat almost, pointed on top, similar to a triangular shape.  I stared for a very longtime, then noticed to it&#39;s left was the same object, slightly lower.  Meaning there were two.  I started filming and trying to take pictures on my iphone that are hard to decipher due to all of the other lights around. I also called my boyfriend to tell him what I was seeing. After almost 15 minutes they started moving in a west direction, pretty quickly. So they were not stars. Definitely not planes. (At least not the usual commercial flying planes).<n> <n><n> <n><n> Last night (11/14/14), two days later I was driving home with my boyfriend, when straight ahead in the sky, we saw the exact same two shapes on the exact same place moving the exact same way. We both watched together as they stood in one place for a long time, then began movingn together in the same direction out of sight. This was all from Irvington Neighborhood.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am reporting 3 different sightings in this post. 2 on the same night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

11/10/14 22:00|Nashville|TN|Fireball|5 minutes|Sighting replicated two nights in a row in West Nashville.|11/14/14|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/115/S115207.html|370|ndxe201411| Sighting replicated two nights in a row in West Nashville.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Profile of sighting(s):  Sighting 1-  11.09.14 2200  At approximately 11pm I was out on a run here in west Nashville.  My approximate location was at the highway 100 highway 70 split.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Upon looking down at the city scape, I noticed a light that seemed to cut the sky in half the way a spot light would if it were pointed directly up into the night sky.  The stream of light was faint due to the saturation of light coming off of the city and the almost full moon.  To give you an idea of my vantage point- the at&amp;t building is facing my direction with this stream of light appearing to disect the building in half vertically.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I looked at this stream for perhaps a minute or so as I tried to discern if it was light coming off of another building (such as a hospital) and as I was doing so a globe appeared directly over the at&amp;t building itself - or so it seemed.  The light was circular or globe like in shape and it emitted a red and orange pulsating light.  The light I saw was akin to tossing red and orange glow in the dark balls into a circular tumbler and then revolving the tumbler in a fashion similar to the way a drying machine might tumble clothing around.  The light I saw had an extremely unusual characteristic to it.  The light appeared to strobe, yet it was faint enough that I didn&#39;t get the impression I was on the dance floor or having a laser pointed at me.  The light lasted approximately 2 minutes and was 4-5 times the size of the at&amp;t logo itself.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After a couple of minutes the intensity of the light decreased -as did the frequency of strobes.  The light then moved in a south/east path over the city and out towards Memphis if you were headed on I 40.  The velocity was&#34;slow&#34; yet constant (similar to that of an airplane cruising at altitude)  with no apparent change in trajectory or pitch.  The light continued to move horizontally across my field of vision until it went behind a tree line and into the night.  No jet stream or sound observed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Sighting 2 -  11.10.14 2200  In an effort to gather some additional information about the sighting - I decided to head out at the same time and be at the same place as I originally saw the object.  I didn&#39;t think that I would be able to replicate my experience, but fortunately I was able to gather some extremely important observational data that may help in identifying what it is I originally saw.  Again at 2200 the night after my initial sighting I saw this object but this time it was different. At this point the object flew into my line of sight as if it came from Memphis into Nashville.  The object exhibited the same behavior as the object I saw last night during it&#39;s exiting phase. I saw it fly in a constant velocity and altitude as it did the night before. This time however - the object stopped in mid air just outside the city and hung there for approximately 30 seconds. Then it proceeded to head out the way it came without any sign that the object actually turned around mid flight.  Essentially it w! as like the object was attached to a tether (like that of a yo-yo approaching the ground- appearing to stop for a second- and then going right back towards it&#39;s initial point of entry into my vantage point)  The entire sighting lasted approximately 6 minutes.  2 min entry. 1 min &#34;stationary.&#34; 2min departure towards initial point of entry.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is the third time that I have witnessed this object - earlier in the summer I saw the same thing as my inititial report above but I didn&#39;t record it on my phone.  I have footage from the Nov. 9 sighting but unfortunately I gave up my personal information in the video.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Que the X-files track!<n>

My first instinct was to go and get my camera.  But instead I just stood and watched it thinking maybe it’s just a plane, because it was moving slowly across the sky.  I thought that planes all have flashing lights and all I saw was this magnificent bright red light that appeared to be slightly orange in color like maybe it had a white light in the middle.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It moved from probably south to north and all of a sudden it just dimmed and went out.  I thought it may have went behind clouds.  I looked hard into the sky and all I could see was stars and even a jet with its flashing lights at a very high altitude.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What I saw appeared to be at a low to medium altitude and not obscured by any tree line.  So I had a clear view of it until it just disappeared.  I hate that I didn’t get my camera.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It’s the first time in my 50 + years that I have ever witnessed such a sight.  I guess that’s what I get for being skeptical and thinking it has to be a plane.<n>

About 5 seconds later, I saw a very bright flash of light out of the corner of my eye in the Southern sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I thought this may be a meteor shower and kept my eyes trained in that direction. I saw another flash, nowhere near as bright, but brighter than a star or an airplane light.  This flash appeared further North from the first very bright flash.  I continued to watch and saw another flash about five seconds later, again further North.  Between flashes, the object was not visible.  I kept watching and saw a flash every five seconds continuing to move North.  The flash was mostly white, but had a bluish tinge to it.  Although the object had a Northerly heading, it did not appear to move in an exactly straight line.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The time from visibility of each flash to fade out was not as fast as the usual airplane strobe, it was noticeably slower.

11/9/14 19:50|Houston|TX|Fireball|2-3 minutes|Observed very bright  orange lights moving at the same altitude across the sky at normal aircraft speeds till they quickly faded.|11/14/14|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/115/S115227.html|388|ndxe201411| Observed very bright  orange lights moving at the same altitude across the sky at normal aircraft speeds till they quickly faded.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I live on a suburb on the northwest  side of Houston known as the Bear Creek area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was doing a little cleanup up in my back yard at about 7:30PM this evening and a bright orange light caught my attention as it was approaching from the west in a direction that I usually observe airlines as they pass overhead to land at Houston Intercontinental Airport.  It began to curve to the north and a second orange light appeared paralleling it a little further to the west.<n> <n><n> <n><n> These were no ordinary craft.  They were much brighter that the landing lights that we often see on aircraft.  They were solid without any blinking or pulsing normally associated with known aircraft.  They were a color orange that was almost as intense as looking at a welding arc with almost the same sort of sharpness.  Very orange.  The first thing I thought of was all the reports of the orange fireballs that many people have been sighting lately.  These were definitely self directed. Piloted!  They were moving about as fast as a normal aircraft.  I would estimate that they were at about 3 to 4 thousand feet in altitude.  They appeared to be roughly 500 ft apart.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They continued to head in a northwesterly direction at about the same altitude paralleling each other  when another one came into view trailing behind the more westerly one at roughly the same distance.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They were in a rough 90 degree pattern all moving in the same direction.  All of this transpired within approximately 30 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At this time I rushed to call my wife and 18 year old son  to see this. They came out quickly to observe what I was seeing and at that time another light appeared further back and  more to the west. At  maybe 800 ft. further back. As we observed all 4 lights they continued to move in a northern direction and began to fade out one by one. They remained the same brightness till within the last 15 seconds or so when they began to fade and then totally disappear. All of this transpired within about 3 minutes before they were totally gone. They all appeared to remain at about the same altitude and speed the entire time. There was no sound heard by any of us. I attempted to bring out a camera to photograph them, however they were to far away to capture them by the time I was able to retrieve one.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am 58 years old. My father was in the Air Force for 18 years of my life and I have lived on and around many Air Force bases in the U. S. and in Europe. I am very familiar with many different aircraft and the required lighting that they display. These were not at all “normal” aircraft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I can also state that my wife, my son and myself have all seen other unexplained craft in the sky at various times in the past, with some that were defiantly not terrestrial. These were some of the most unusual we have ever seen.<n>

We saw 3 meteors and only one seemed to appear brighter and flamed out.  Then about 3 mins later a gray shape appeared in the eastern portion of the sky line. we stood up and pointed at this gray shape that I thought were a flock of birds until it changed shape.  This shape change appeared to look like a stingray and flapped its wings.  It took 3 to 5 seconds to cross the skyline above our pool. We could not see thru this object.  This object was totally silent. The size of the object was like holding up a quarter and looking at it as though it was in the sky.  This object was oval and oblong and seemed to have winged points expand from the sides. This object moved from the east to the west directly above our pool.  I thought it was migratory birds.  No lights and No sounds.  This sighting was extremely odd. no planes were in the sky.  At this time the sky was clear and bright. we both spoke at length as to wha! t just happened.  We believe we saw an object larger than a bird. larger than 100 birds that fly around each other to keep warm.  Not a plane because no lights or sounds.  This object took the shape of a stingray but we could not make out any tail.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This sighting made such an impression that we spoke about filing a notice.  Something did fly over our head and was silent with no lights or sound.<n>

I&#39;m amazed how it cuts through light pollution.<n> <n><n> <n><n> While sitting on my swing and looking up at stars a T-Formation came into view. At first it looked solid but it had individual squarish looking objects in it.  There were no lights but they had a almost tan/luminescent color to them against the dark sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I lowered my binoculars I still saw the T- formation as it went behind some trees I stood up but the horizon was blocked by more trees.  At first I thought these were geese but I&#39;ve never seen birds fly in a T formation that huge and travel so quickly.  The flew like they knew where they were going.  Through the binoculars and without they were in a perfect formation and it did look like, possibly, they were part of a T.  It reminded me of those huge formations sighted in space.  I would put the size as a ruler put at arms length. Travelling fast like a T at eleven o&#39;clock.  Much higher than passenger aircraft.  Possibly in space. A slight aura around the whole T-formation.<n>

While I was in my back yard in Wanaque, I saw two, what appeared to be either F-16s or F-18s &#34;chasing&#34; an object over the Ramapo Mountains just east of the Wanaque Reservoir.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The planes flew very low and very fast.  I looked up when I heard the sound of the jet engines, and what I saw ahead of them was a very small, silvery &#34;dot.&#34;  They flew from the south over route 287 in Haskell and banked sharply east over Midvale and went over the Mountains in the direction of Oakland.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I checked the local news for any mention of an air show and found nothing.  These two planes, and the object in front of them were flying way too low and too fast to be a normal training flight.  As I stated earlier, I could not tell if the planes were F-16s or F-18s because they were right above me when they turned east.  I was on a westerly facing mountain slope at an elevation of 460 above sea level.<n>

We began watching it and comparing it to its location above the neighbors house to the east for matter of reference.<n> <n><n> <n><n> During the time we watched this light we saw it zig back and forth in the sky.  While it did not move around a tremendous amount, the movement was still noticeable.  Also, at times the light would pulsate slowly, rarely changing from a white light to red then back to white.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After watching this light move for nearly an hour we looked southeast and discovered another light in the shy that also was moving erratically in the sky.  The first light we saw moved toward in the sky to nearly 80 degrees and became noticing dimmer as time went on.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We live in a flight path for one of the busiest airports in the US and are very accustomed to airplanes flying over.  This hovered in the same general area for over an hour, moving in multiple directions during that time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We couldn&#39;t stand to be out in the cold any longer and decided to come inside before either light went out of view or disappeared.<n>

When I looked into the sky I saw a FLEET of unusual objects traveling southwest at about  four thousand feet high and close to 50 or 60 of them.  There was no sound coming from them they also had no exhaust or tail to speak of.  They moved at a medium speed across the sky.They was a redish yellow color.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They was lined up in a row but not a perfect row at first two rows that became one row.  They did not loose altitude nor gain a big amount of altitude as if your looking at a plane traveling, but these was not any aircraft!  They stayed the course of southwest with difference in space between them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The strings of objects lasted about 5 minutes.  The length of string of objects would be approximately  2-4 miles from first object to last.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Two strings one on top of the other was the first mile worth of the objects, again not in a perfect formation.<n>

The lights flashed irregularly and at a very fast pace, unlike any aircraft lights I have seen in the past.  The lights would flash and then go dark from some distance, and flash again and go dark, for what seemed to be the same distance.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It repeated this for five sequences of flashing fading in brightness each time until it went dark.  The manner that it “went dark” to me resembled the same way a satellite dimes and fades until it can no longer be seen, so I believe its altitude was very high and fast.  The initial flash was sufficiently bright enough in my peripheral vision to grab my attention; the second seemed to be equally as bright and it dimmed from that point on.<n>

After spending the day hours in downtown Palm Springs we returned to our rental in La Quinta, Ca.  We changed and headed for the pool.  We rode our bikes from our home to a pool located near the main gate of the community.  We swam in the pool and then moved to the hot tub.<n> <n><n> <n><n> While in the hot tub, we relaxed and stargazed, as we often do while we are there.  I began looking west towards the Santa Rosa Mountains admiring the numerous stars in the night sky.  We talked about how dark it was compared with home for same time of evening, it was around 1815 to 1840 hours.  We chatted about how many stars were visible and how pleasant it was out.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A movement in the sky next to a 2 palm trees which line the interior SW corner of the pool landscaping caught my eye.  I thought at first it must be the shadow of a large bird flapping its wings.  It took a second for me to realize it was not bird in flight.  The object was not just behind the palm tree but in the sky beyond it.  It occupied the airspace between my location and the mountain.  As it moved across the sky from behind the palm tree I saw it was large. Its size made it difficult to judge its actual dimensions (I would guess as large as a commercial airliner) or its altitude in the sky.  Frankly, its appearance confused me so could only base my observations by comparing it to the mountain and palm trees. From my vantage point it was as large as the top of the palm tree fronds (not its actual size but the object was in the distance and still looked about the size palm tree top)  This palm tree is about 40 feet tall and the object was about the same size in the sky.  Its altitude seemed to be no more than the height of the mountain that runs adjacent to the community on the far west side.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I first noticed the object it seemed blurry. (I use the term blurry only because I can not properly describe what was happened to the surface on the triangle for the first moments until it became clear/focused).  It moved into a clearing passed the palm trees at an angle just in front and above me.  There were no obstructions between myself and the object.  It was literally right in front of me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The night sky was my backdrop as it moved across the sky.  It was a large equilateral triangle. Its height was far less in comparison to its length of its sides.  (I could not see the top and saw nothing protruding above it)  The outside of it was darker than the night sky but it blended into the sky above it.  The object itself was black and seemed shiny when it was at its most focused point (meaning the shape was blurry and then came into focus).  I could make out the outer edges of the triangle and also the whole body as it blocked the stars in the sky it passed in front of.  I could not make out any surface details.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Each corner of the triangle housed a round light. The lights were not small beacon lights but quite large. The round lights were not extremely bright and seemed a muted yellow even dim. The lights did not pulsate or flash like airplane beacons either.  It also appeared clearer to me the more directly in front of me it was.  It continued across the sky until it was NE of me.  It passed behind more palm trees at which point I lost it in the sky and could no longer locate it.  The object made no noise and seemed completely silent.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The aircraft moved from the SW towards the NE across the sky.  It moved slowly but never stopped, slower than a C130 at an airshow slow.  The entire aircraft slowly rotated on its axis. I believe it rotated counter clockwise.  It did not change direction or altitude.  Its movement across the sky seemed effortless.  It seemed to float in the air like a raft would float on the water but light like cottonwood seed fuzz.  A smooth movement like a ball bearing rolling across a glass top table.  Its movement was very different than any plane, helicopter or balloon I have ever seen. Smooth, slow, light and effortless.<n> <n><n> <n><n> During the time I was watching the object, I attempted to point it out to my wife and young son.  Neither were able to see it and they told me I was quite excited while pointing toward it and not making much sense to them.  I described to them what I saw; &#34;a large triangle with three round lights in the corners slowly rotating as it moved across the sky.&#34;  Important things about this siting.  This was a calm night with little to no breeze.  This particular community proximity to mountain makes flying a plane, helicopter too dangerous/not possible especially at night without lights.  The community has only ground lighting. The community is far away from city lights.  The community is flanked by the Santa Rosa Mountains to the west blocking all light pollution from the west.  The community is also far away from urban areas and is quite quiet, especially in the evenings.  The object was much lower than any plane I have witnessed above the property.  Most planes I have seen are flying at cruising altitudes far above the mountains.  The helicopters I have seen are military and also fly well above the mountains.  I believe we had a full moon on the 8th but the moon starts low at the horizon line until it moves upwards into the sky later in the evening.  Also reported to MUFON.<n>

I&#39;m just about to post it when I noticed a circular object just above the sun.  So I zoomed the image and I was shocked to see that it looks like a blue green ball with white spikes in it.  So I took another picture again thinking that it might be a reflection or an there&#39;s a defect with my camera lenses on my mobile.  The blue object moves to the left in every picture I made.  I was still very skeptic about it so my friend took a picture as well from his mobile.  And there it is!  He captured it too.  I don&#39;t know, maybe this is a planet, or a satellite, or a drone.  The experience is weird.<n>

The first 3 appeared together and seemed to be floating fairly quickly along the coast.  The moon was extremely bright and far above the lights but they appeared much brighter than any stars or planets in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What was strange was 1.  For being so close to the ground and so near us, there was no sound of an airplane or helicopter engine.  2.  The lights were unusually bright and very orange -almost like flames.  3.  They did not blink steadily like commercial planes- in fact, they did not blink at all.  4.  The first set moved quickly along the coast and seemed to move out to sea before fading and disappearing one by one over about 5 minutes.  5.  We thought they might be those luminaries that people sometimes release blowing in the wind, but one of them in the second set remained stationary for several minutes.  6.  The last one remained stationary for a while. It was very close to the horizon.  We concluded it must be Jupiter and took put the star map app on the iPad to check.  By the time we got it calibrated, the &#34;stationary&#34; object had floated upwards before going out like a flame burning out.<n>

They were a reddish orange in color.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I yelled to my husband to come and look and he stared staring at the sky,and a truck that came to the stop sign looked and said what ((deleted)) is that as they pointed also at the sky.<n>

There is generally just two persons manning the plant during the night shift.  While making rounds I noticed what at first appeared to be a single flashing red light (like a typical radio tower light) to the north of my position.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The light was unusual so I stopped the vehicle and watched it.  It was moving slowly in a westward direction toward town.  While I was watching, the light split into three lights making a perfect upright triangle.  The blinking frequency did not change.  There was a beam of light the same color and intensity of the corners of light connecting the three points.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When this happened I called the other operator at the control room on the radio for him to go outside and look at what I was seeing.  As soon as he answered me the lights went back into one red light with white lights flashing beside it and appeared to be a normal airplane.  I told him to disregard, whatever it was was gone.<n>

11/7/14 19:45|Jamestown|OH|Light|30-45 seconds?|Orange lights blinking in and out.|11/14/14|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/115/S115259.html|427|ndxe201411| Orange lights blinking in and out.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I walked out onto our back porch to have a cigarette at about 7:45PM.  A light caught my attention in the southeastern sky. I would estimate it to have been about 20 degrees off the horizon.  I got the impression that the light was not very far from the edge of town but it&#39;s difficult to say.  It was round or spherical and a medium shade of orange with no other colors apparent.  There appeared to be a slight aura surrounding it. The light seemed to be moving very slowly toward what would be northeast of my position. It hadn&#39;t gone very far at all when it suddenly &#34;blinked out&#34;.  Seconds later a new light of the same description and apparent size &#34;blinked on&#34;.  The new light was trailing behind the first. In other words, I do not believe it to have been the same light.  The second light, like the first, blinked out after a few seconds.  Now, several more lights of the same description and size appeared in the following seconds, however, they did not all follow the same movement pattern of the first two.  Some moved up, some moved down etc.  There were also instances where two lights would appear together but there never seemed to be more than two illuminated at once.  A few of the lights did make some rather erratic movements as well.  I do not believe they were simply being blown by the wind.  All of the lights blinked out or disappeared within a few seconds of appearing.  The lights did not seem to flicker. I saw nothing dripping from them or being cast off them.  Seven to ten lights would be my best estimate as to how many I saw in total.  The event lasted no more than thirty to fourty-five seconds. I would estimate each light to have been about the size of a small pea at arms length.  The general look and movement of the lights seemed odd to me.  There is no way for me to be sure of course but I didn&#39;t get the impression that they could have been airplanes, helicopters, flares or fireworks.  I&#39;ve never noticed any weather ! phenomena resembling this either and I&#39;ve lived in the immedia! te area for most of my life.  Definitely unusual.<n>

Then they formed a triangle.  Then vertical line...which....what?  Horizontal line.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I video taped some of it with my phone camera as my battery died and tried to take photos which all turned out crappy but I have never seen anything like this and it is freaking me out.

My daughter says she say four.  I did see a plane behind these formations about five minutes in.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am reporting this due to the methodical way the lights moved.

11/7/14 05:25|Wade|NC|Light|1-2 hours|Strange dancing, multidirectional light in the sky|11/14/14|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/115/S115191.html|438|ndxe201411| Strange dancing, multidirectional light in the sky<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is the 3rd time I have witnessed this strange light over the treeline outside of my house in the past 2 weeks.  It always comes to the same area as the last time, it usually stays for about 2 hours on average and I&#39;m watching it right now.  It darts around in the air, stopping and changing direction mid path, it will travel a little to the left then stop and take off to the right.  Sometimes it goes very fast other times it just moves up and down or in a serpentine motion up to the left/right or down to the left/right then stop and do it again. It&#39;s far away so it&#39;s small and difficult to make out or get a good look but it&#39;s a small light that changes colors and even gets brighter, I notice mostly red,white and bluish colors but it changes fast.  It darts around in these motions for around 2 hours gradually getting higher but staying in the same area.  The first time I saw it I had about 5 friends come look just so they could see it and maybe help me figure ! out what exactly it was but what starts so many different directions then stops and goes in a completely different direction in mid air. I never hear any sounds and it&#39;s like the lights are moving or flickering, it&#39;s not a solid color or light that stays on or blinks like an airplane other helicopter and it sure doesn&#39;t travel like one either. It&#39;s too small and far away for me to get a video or photo with my phone because I have tried multiple times.  As I said, this is the 3rd time I have sat and watched this thing dance around in the sky like a bug does around a light gradually getting higher and higher.  I&#39;ve never watched it long enough to see how it ends or where it goes so I couldn&#39;t tell you. I just looked up and saw it dart downward very fast then stop, go the left, dart back up, circle to the right and loop back downward.  It never goes to the ground just dances around in the same area in these odd start and stop motions.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Any information or professional help on this matter would be great and I&#39;m sorry if this is poorly written, but I really don&#39;t know how to describe this occurrence, you would have to see it on your own.  It&#39;s always in the area over by where Dunn would be, off in that general direction and stays for a long time.  Thank you<n>

I though it was strange that a plane would move that slow.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I kept driven, I got a clear view, and realized it was a round object at about 7,000 ft. (not sure)  It had square color lights around it.  The lights took turn flashing brighter than the others, but it was not at a fast speed.  Or maybe the object was moving in circles but it was very slow, as it seemed to be sitting still in the air.  I kept driving to my destination so no sure how long it remained in place.  Also, since there was not too much activity around me, I feared a little, and just wanted to find a place to be safe.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

Since I live in a busy flight path I was trying to find any sort of sign it was a normal aircraft such as other flashing lights yet I didn&#39;t see any.

I thought they were helicopters but my boyfriend said that we would have heard them.  These objects were 100% silent and floated across the sky.  There were another 3-4 more round objects following behind and at first they appeared to be traveling in a similar formation then they became random as one by one they started to disappear until the last one was gone.  A few seconds later a commercial plane flew by over head and we could clearly hear it which told us the objects we saw were silent and moving MUCH slower than the plane.<n>

It being unusual to see planes traveling that close together ( as the brightness and size of both lights were identical) I watched a moment longer and noticed that they were stationary.  They were definitely hovering. I naturally assumed they were helicopters, though the red lights were unusual compared to other helicopters I&#39;ve seen at night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> With that thought I pulled slowly onto a side street where I could watch the lights, and confirmed that they were not moving.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At that point, three bright white lights in a triangular formation replaced one of the red lights. in other words, the red light went out as the other lights came on.  The triangle and the other red light began moving together, quite as if they were connected, yet at this time they were still a short distance apart from each other.  The remaining red light went out and was replaced by the same pattern and brightness white lights as the first object.  They then moved together, very, very close, so that if you drew two triangles of three dots each, the two would &#34;share&#34; the center dot.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They started to move west, at first quickly, then they paused in place for a few seconds, then extremely quickly they went west and soon were lost from view.  They appeared to be rising in altitude as they moved, but despite this they were lost from view due to my position in a valley of sorts between hills.  During this sighting I lowered my car windows to hear any jet engine sounds, but I heard none.  I did notice other aircraft, much higher, and much more typical of commercial planes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;ve seen military fighter jets travel in that close a formation, but never outside of an air show, and not at night. If these were military, they have to be of the variety that can hover, and then speed off.  Certainly military planes exist that can do so, but I think those are rare enough that the sighting deserved to be reported here.<n>

I summoned them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had a major UFO sighting today. This afternoon I experimented with Robert Bingham&#39;s UFO summoning technique.  I did not get any obvious results. I then walked to the store to get some food and a pair of binoculars. When I was walking home I saw a white orb moving from South to North. I then communicated with it telepathically, and asked it to come closer. Then the one orb divided into a whole fleet of brilliant and spectacular white orbs, forming a whole fleet of about one hundred orbs, and moving from North to South. I could not believe my eyes, and stood there in total shock. This man happened to be walking by me, and I pointed to the orbs. He also saw them. He just happened to have a knife, and cut open the plastic container holding my binoculars. We both looked through the binoculars and saw the UFO fleet. The whole vision lasted about five minutes. And then right before my eyes the orbs vanished. I tried to record on my Flip video recorder, but since i! t has horrible zoom, I could not see anything. I was in such an exuberant state anyway that I don&#39;t think I even focused on the right spot. I was too excited. I cannot even describe the shock and emotions I was experiencing.<n>

Elden<n> <n><n> <n><n> I saw a small. silver, cigar  shaped craft, slowly flying in front of Mt. Elden, heading to the south east.  It was like a silver, oblong, oval, capsule moving slowly enough, it mimicked the speed of a hang-glider.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It continued heading southeast, for about 4 and half minutes, until I looked away for a second and it was gone.  I had seen similar shaped things, a couple of weeks prior, only at night and going in the opposite direction heading north west in the night sky and then slowly truning to the south west and disappearing.  They were lit up silver, cigar shaped and there were 3 of them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At the time, I didn&#39;t think much about it, but now, having seen another one in the daylight, I kind of confirmed it for myself.<n>

I looked up at the sky, a habit now. My house is on top of a hill, so I had a clear view of the sky over the school.  My eyes lade on to a circular object,  That was white, almost see-through moving about the same speed that a low flying airplane would move (but this is an optical illusion; the speed of an airplane) but it was way higher than any airplane, flying low or high, would be at, therefore, flying much faster.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I was walking to school, I stayed far from the school so I could still see it, looking down at my feet occasionally so I wouldn’t lose my step.  But, the third of forth time I did this, when I looked back up to see it again, it was gone.  I mean, like poof, it just disappeared, or it flew away at very high speeds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Sadly, I didn&#39;t hav my Ipod with me so I couldn&#39;t take a video of it.<n>

Making loops over the Arizona desert near Coolidge, AZ<n> <n><n> <n><n> On 11-05-14 at approximately 0450 hours, I awoke to let the dogs outside in the backyard. It was a still night with no wind and a full moon.  I immediately observed a single oval shaped object emitting blinking lights that changed color from red to white and back to red.  The object could be seen between two mountain peaks from the San Tan mountain range which is on the Gila River Indian Reservation land.  The object appeared to hover over the City of Coolidge, but its actual size could not be determined for certain.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I watched the object for 10 minutes as it moved quickly up and down and side to side very quickly. I woke my wife up and we both watched it another 10 minutes together as it stayed between the mountain peaks.  No sound could be heard during the 20 minute observation.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I called the Coolidge Police Department later in the morning and they had no reports from citizens or calls for service about the object.  It is unknown what it was.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I tried to video record the object on my cell phone, but it was too dark and too far away to be recognizable.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have lived in the desert my entire life and have never seen anything like this before.  It was not a helicopter, airplane or balloon.<n>

Upon looking up, I noticed something blocking out some of the stars in the area where I was watching. I seen a series of lights and thought to myself, It&#39;s a plane.  However the light formation was like none I ever seen.  I continued to look at this &#34;plane&#34;.  My eyes adjusted to this &#34;plane&#34; and realized it was a round object with a set of very dim red lights. It was not a plane. It was a UFO.<n>

At first being near Baton Rouge with our chemical plants, I thought the noise was the plant kicking up their flame stacks to burn more chemicals. Sometimes at night they do this and you can hear it for about 30 minutes to an hour. I walked out to get a better idea of which direction it was coming from and immediately noticed a group of flashing lights in the sky. I knew this couldn&#39;t be airplanes flashing in the distance because of first off the lights were in a triangle shape and they were all the same distance from me. Also the lights were flashing in ssequential order from left to right in perfect timing. I watched as the sound got louder and then noticed they were all moving together towards northwest from original location I spotted it in. The lights lead me to believe instead of 5 different objects,  this was one very large object. As! large as my town half of my town of Zachary Louisiana. Roughly 4 miles across.  As it moved away I ran and woke my mother to have a second witness. My mom does not believe in UFOs and she was also convinced it was one large triangle.  As it got further away the rumbling stopped and also the front light became solid and stayed on until no lights were visible.  I would LOVE to know if anything was reported on Radar being I live near Baton Rouge airport. This also means I am used to flashing lights from planes and also study passing satellites and orbiting rocket bodies using a sky monitoring app for satellites in the sky. Lots of cloud cover tonight but clouds were very high. I did not see any single planes tonight though. These were the only lights. I always see strange objects because I watch the skys. I have seen more than one anomalies in the same direction from my front yard. But this was the first ever hearing anything and first triangle craft or at least formation.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I took a picture of it with my phone, but it doesn&#39;t show up in the photo, possibly because I couldn&#39;t zoom in.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I stood there watching the object, it began moving westward after a few minutes and decended out of my view as it slowly dropped down on the other side of the foothills.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke via telephone with the witness and he emphasized how bright, and how bizarre looking, the object was.

After about a minute, these lights began moving slowly as if blown by the wind, but in different directions.  Some of the lights raised into the sky while the lowest light moved horizontally until one by one, they went out as if burning out like a candle.  All of the lights were of a uniform color and luminosity.<n>
11/4/14 17:45|Locust Grove|GA|Light|30 seconds|Three lights, one object, hovering on the northern horizon.|11/6/14|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/115/S115144.html|480|ndxe201411| Three lights, one object, hovering on the northern horizon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Possible UFO Sighting, Tuesday, November 4, 2014 Locust Grove, Georgia, 30248 05:45 P.M. (17:45 hours)  The below sighting lasted roughly 30 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Driving northbound on Georgia State Route 42, Locust Grove – McDonough, I observed what at first appeared to be a large commercial aircraft flying southbound, in my line of sight, above and to the right – due northeast – within the vantage point of my vehicle’s windshield, and (though I cannot confirm), it appeared to be traveling towards me, due south, some ten to fifteen or so miles in the distance, but bright enough for me to take notice.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Though I was busy concentrating on the road, this apparition of light commanded my attention. I thought it odd that a commercial airliner was traveling due south over Henry County, as this flight path and direction is rather unusual for the local airspace (most commercial jets descend through Henry County on their approach into Atlanta-Hartsfield Jackson Airport, either from the south, east, and occasionally, the west, but rarely from the north; Henry County is located south of the airport). I assumed it was a commercial jet because of the pattern of lights – three concentric circles of white light, indicative to me of the two lights that appear on both wings of an airliner, and the center light that appears beneath the nose of an airliner. However, there were no other visible lights, red or green, colors that are clear markings of the wing tips of commercial airliners. I merely concluded that perhaps it was a jet that had taken off from Atlanta’s airport, and was traveling ! due south, though there was no visible or recognizable movement.<n> <n><n> <n><n> However, in just under 30 seconds or so later, the lights simply vanished. The sun was setting at this point to my left, but it was still considerably bright enough to have noticed if this craft made any turn, the sunlight allowing for the possibility of identifying the shape or color of this craft; but no, all I had seen were lights, with no apparent movement, hovering in the distance, and in under a minute, they were gone. It was akin to the lights atop a water or radio tower, such lights that brighten, then fade, brighten, then fade; these lights definitely were bright, and definitely faded, but did not brighten again. It did not move or maneuver to another location in the horizon. The lights simply went out.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have never observed this kind of phenomenon before.  Thank you for considering this eyewitness account as evidence of a possible UFO sighting.<n>

Low Level Flight pattern.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I first notices a VERY bright light coming out of the South and proceeding more or less due North.  Its lights were &#34;intense&#34; to say the very least.  I have been around aircraft for many years in the USAF so I know what landing lights look like and the intensity of even the largest airplane.  This had to be 5 times as bright (or brighter).  Additionally, the lights were 2 seemingly separate but ? attached ? lights shining straight down.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The leading light was the largest and the trailing attached light was 50% (plus) as bright.  It seemed to be having trouble turning its lights of as they were fluctuating together but randomly.  I perceived that fact only because I could think of no other reason for such random fluctuations.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As it came overhead I noted that it was so low that it was in the region where local single engine aircraft would fly and NOT where Passenger/Military aircraft fly in our area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As it passed overhead I heard absolutely NOTHING, not anything.  Total and complete silence.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It lit up my yard and everything within a mile or more so that I could clearly see my dog who was in the back yard with me.  It was casting so much light that I could distinctly see the shadows of my fence, my dog, and the house.  Not distinctly but notably casting a perceivable shadow.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The light itself was PURE white and there were no flashing lights (running light) with which I am extremely aware of due to being around airplanes of all kinds (including stealth).<n> <n><n> <n><n> It continues STRAIGHT north and eventually either disappeared over the mountains to the north of us or was able to extinguish its lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> To indicate my professional credentials.  I worked on the NASA Space Station Design Team (Technical Staff - Computers and such.  I have been to most NASA sites stateside but not all.  I also worked for U of Colo CASA/NASA research team and built the guidance system and wiring harnesses for 2 research rockets which were trying to locate the center of the universe.<n> <n><n> <n><n> One rocket was fired from White Sands Proving Ground and the second was fired from Woomera Australia (NASA).  It failed to release one stabilization chain and the rocket tilted and was quickly over ridden by staff to re-fire the explosive to release the chain.  It flew toward Adelaide and crashed just on the outskirts.  It never got into space to finish its mission.<n> <n><n> <n><n> NASA took over from there and I have never heard back from anyone but understand that they did determine that the NASA mission did confirm the land coordinate as well as the White Sands data.  The center of the universe is just beneath the &#34;Eye of Horus&#34;.

There were some clouds in the sky but the light hovered in a clear space.  It was the light quality that first caught my attention; it didn’t appear natural.  It was a clear, bright white light with red and green lights underneath.  It was at a distance (maybe 40+ miles) so there was no sound.  I can’t accurately describe the shape because of the distance.  If I had to guess the shape, I would say it was like a slightly squat football turned on its point.  We viewed it through binoculars and could see that it was pulsating.  There were red and green lights that glowed and blinked from underneath the object.  We passed the binoculars back and forth between us, trying to figure out what it was.  We ruled out a star, comet/meteorite and a plane.  I wonder if a helicopter would look like this from a distance at night? I was tempted to get in the car and drive to where it was hovering, but I was too afraid to get closer to it.  We observed it for about 10 minutes and it was still there when we went inside our home.  Since the object was so far away, I hesitated to report this but I can’t stop thinking about it and decided to put the information online in case someone else in the area saw it and has a better description.<n>

It moved at a constant speed, exhibited NO deceleration and apparently never deviated from its straight-line course.  It was shockingly bright against the dark sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It disappeared behind the tree line across the road after a few seconds.  It left a very slight after-image or light trail in its path, which may have been a visual artifact due to it being so bright against such a dark sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It moved way faster than an aircraft, but seemed too slow for a meteor.  It also appeared to be quite large, even at a perceived distance of several miles.  In the distance, it was about two mm in diameter, and round.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My view of it was perfectly clear and vivid.  I was driving 60-65 mph and it blew past us like we were standing still.  It was over way too fast to get a photo.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My daughter, who was playing with her phone also caught it out of the corner of her eye.  It was bright enough to get her attention even though she was playing a game on her phone.  She looked up and asked what it was.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was in the car with the radio on, windows up at highway speed and the object was at a distance, so I cannot make any report as to sound or lack thereof.<n>

The bright white light changed to bright green and the object moved quickly through the sky circling in front of us.  The smaller flashing red light at times swung out quite far from the main light and at times disappeared completely.

We are both 23 year old females.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We noticed the first craft when we saw an immensely bright yellowish light in the sky, this light seemed to hover, and that light began to dim and started gliding through the sky.  We realized we had never seen an aircraft look quite like this.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When we looked back up at the sky to follow the craft, we began to notice the array of flashing lights.  There were two red flashing lights on the outermost points of the diamond shaped craft.  On one of of these points, there was also a bluish green light that would flash.  The craft had yellowush/white lights at the bottom base of the diamond and a yellowish/white light in the front.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We began noticing how different each crafts lights appeared.  As we continued driving, we began seeing so many of these crafts in the sky.  They were appearing out of nowhere.  One craft hovered over street lights so we could distinctly see the shape of the craft.  It was NOT a plane.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The way these crafts moved were unlike anything we have ever seen.  Hovering and gliding would be the best way to explain the movement.  At this point we pulled over at a remote farm in our town to get out of the car and get a better look.  The crafts continued to appear in all directions of the sky.  We felt like we were in a science fiction move with what we were seeing and experiencing.  It was alarming how quickly they were appearing. Bright yellowish lights would appear and another craft would present itself.   Some of the crafts had red flashing lights on the side points of the diamonds, some had yellowish/white flashing lights.  Each craft had a bluish green light.  The crafts were moving low and slow, and then would cover a huge distance at an untraceable rate in seconds.  One craft appeared larger than the rest we had sign.  It emitted a very large beam of yellowish white light from the front of the craft, and the yellowish white lights on the! bottom were the brightest we had seen.  It was larger than the other crafts we had seen as well.  We were able to see the diamond shape and bottom of the crafts clearly, and as we would watch it travel, it would reach unimaginable distances right in front of our eyes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As we made it home, the crafts flew over us for the remaining 45 minutes.  One came so low to the ground that we were extremely spooked.  We had never in our lives, seen anything quite like this.  The sound the crafts made were almost the most eerie part of the experience.  At first it was a dull humming, and as it came closer it would get louder.  It emitted a low pitch sound frequency, and you could feel the vibration.  A sound, we have never heard, before last night.  It sent shivers up our spines.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At around 1:00 am on November 3rd, the sightings stopped.  The crafts had disappeared, and the sky returned to normal.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We know what we saw, I never thought this experience would happen to me, but these crafts were UFO&#39;s.<n>

Having been a pilot for 30 years and a flight instructor for almost 20, I supposed it was an airplane.  However, this light did not move.  Had it been a hovering helicopter, I would have heard it, but it made no sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After about 20 minutes, it began moving in a circle, then bobbing up and down.  I compared it to stationary ground objects, steadying myself against a road sign to make sure that it was moving and not myself.  Since I do not believe in UFOs, I went inside after about a half hour.  Curiosity got the best of me an hour later, and I went back outside to check on it, and saw that it had moved almost directly overhead.

Unidentified aerial phenomenon in Bellevue, WA.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My friend and I were at the the park.  It was nearing dusk.  Sun setting at approximately 20 degrees to the horizon.  I notice a white light orb fly from left to right into a long thin cloud (the cloud almost looked like a contrail).<n> <n><n> <n><n> I expected it to fly out the other side of the cloud as an airplane would.  But it did not but in fact remained hidden in the cloud for a moment, then exited, but from the opposite direction!  It flew left and out of view for a moment then came back to the right and flew a little higher and was just then hovering above the cloud.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My friend and I and I began taking pictures and video with our phones and we noticed the object is pulsating almost like a giant strobe light in the sky, but a slightly irregular pattern.  A moment later three other white orbs of light appear and are hovering there in place (So there are now four orbs that are just hovering in place above this odd looking cloud) and one of the newly arrived orbs (the one furthest right and lowest in the sky) just all of a sudden lets out a huge flash of light and then those three just disappear as quickly as they came, leaving the original one remaining.  It then slowly flew to the left and out of view again.  This was the end of the sighting which whole thing lasted about ten minutes (I have the last 5 minutes on video).<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I did check the video I was amazed to find that only the first white orb was captured by the phone camera (and only for a few moments otherwise it is apparently cloaked from video recording but not the human eye).  I was also very surprised to discover, on the video footage, much larger grey objects, moving at impossible speeds, that are shape shifting as they zoom across the view.  I had to play the video back frame by frame just to do a screen capture and there is at least one,  I would say school bus sized grey craft that seems to have two large lights on the back and maybe a light aura around it.  This object was completely invisible to my friend and I as we were witnessing the white orbs.  I would be interested in having a scientist examine my video to tell me approximately how fast this craft is flying.  Also none of the objects made any sound whatsoever…<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness provides no contact information, so we are unable to provide him with the information he requests.

It was hovering staying very still, it hovered to the right n stayed still like no movement at all then after a few minutes it changed direction and went right sat still then a couple minutes later it went straight upward fast and stopped, hovered for a few minutes once again, and then just took off east and disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was a helicopter that came into view, but it was a lot lower then the object also a couple airplanes, you can clearly see its neither a plane nor a helicopter.  Me and my husband both got everything recorded.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was also a few people behind us that noticed it.  This happened 11/02/14 at 6:03 pm.

On First November 2014, I was on call duty.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I received an emergency call from the Hospital.  My father drove me on bike from home to the Hospital.  After attending the patient, we headed home.  My father was driving the bike and I was sitting behind.  Distance from Hospital to my home is about 8 km.  About 3 km from the Hospital on West of cord road I Observed an unusual sighting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On the cord road, we were driving on the left side, on the right side there was a temple. At about 10.45 pm, I observed a sighting around here.  There were three intense bright golden/amber coloured  lights in the sky.  They were in a triangular formation. They were moving very slowly in a Horizontal plane.  They were very intense oval shaped lights.  I have not seen such light before.  The lights seemed to waiver.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My father continued to drive. I told him to stop the vehicle. We stopped before entering the Toll gate Underpass. Underpass is constructed below a major intersection. It connects cord road to Vijayanagar. Underpass is about 250 meters. We stopped before entering the underpass. I took out my phone and started taking pictures. I was still seated on the bike when I recorded.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I noticed that the three lights in triangular formation were moving very slowly in a horizontal plane. Suddenly and very rapidly one of the lights shot up into the sky and disappeared. Seconds later the other two lights  also shot up and disappeared one after the other. I have taken pictures of the three lights in triangular formation.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Subsequently another light of the same nature appeared. I have taken video of this. A passing by car ,seeing us recording stopped briefly and proceeded again. Another light appeared behind the first Light in the sky. They were also moving slowly in a horizontal plane.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Me and my father started driving again. We entered and exited the underpass. After exiting, I noticed that Of the two lights, the first light disappeared. In its position but much nearer, I observed an object. The object was somewhat triangular in shape with blunt edges. It had a dark/black surface. The surface seemed to be uneven/wrinkled. Second light was still visible and had not disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I reached home and narrated the events to my husband. We circulated the images and videos to   some known people on Whatsapp. Nobody has replied. Probably they think its a prank or a hoax or a joke or fire crackers.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It cannot be a firecracker as there was no sound or blast noise associated. It was initially moving Horizontally and later abruptly shot up. Fire crackers cant do that.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It could not be a plane or a helicopter as it was quite close and no sound was heard.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My Husband is a UFO enthusiast. I am a Sceptic. I did not believe in such things. This incident has made me to think in terms of UFO&#39;s being a possibility. Also, it has made me realise that others do not believe you when you have witnessed a genuine sighting, much the same way I would disregard UFO videos on you tube which my husband watches.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I first saw the lights, I knew it was unusual. It was intense. I Thought of calling my husband but didn&#39;t have time to do the same. I didn&#39;t know how to use my phone to capture the photo and video. I had been using a small non Android phone for 10 years till 2-3 days earlier. MY husband bought a smartphone which I have started using since 2-3 days. Somehow I managed to take pictures. I wanted to zoom in and record, but I didn&#39;t know how.<n>

I turned and looked and it was a red fireball floating in a slow upward diagonal motion.  Called my son and we both went out side on the patio to watch it.  After awhile it flickered on and off about about 4 times moving in a much faster sideways motion and then disapeared.  The whole thing lasted about 10 minutes.<n>

I have no idea how high up it was, it was not at the height of a plane but was definitely way above the tree line, and all I could see was a shape.  It literally looked like a roundish rectangular loaf of bread flying through the sky.  There was no color to it, just a shape.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It went in a straight line, at what looked like a very consistent speed, and I was able to watch it all the way across the sky above me, until it flew out of sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first I thought the wind had caught something up but it was so steady, just cruising along, and the wind doesn&#39;t move things! like that, not to mention the wind was blowing in a completely different direction, at least that is how it felt.  It&#39;s hard to describe how I felt, bewildered would probably be the best description, oh, that and...a little crazy.  I keep trying to rationalize it but I just can&#39;t.<n> <n><n> <n><n> By far the coolest thing I have ever seen in my life.<n>

For your reference,look up at Cassiopeia,extend your arms,and bend your wrists in so you can put four fingers on top of the other ones.  About 8 fingers down from the bottom star of Cassiopeia and a little to the right, is a dim but noticeable star.  There&#39;s a dimmer one close and to the right of that one.  Just to the left of those stars, was a bright, not white but towards amber, light.  It was brighter than a magnitude O star, which is why I noticed it as soon as I stepped out the door!  It wasn&#39;t moving at all.  I was torn between running in the house and grabbing my binoculars and staying put!<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;m glad I stayed because at about 30 or 40 seconds, it just got dimmer till it was gone.  It appeared to go directly &#34;away&#34; from my vantage point.  No left to right deviation what so ever.<n>

One proceeded to fly northwest.  The first ones where heading north.  Also one dropped down to make all appear in an L shape.  My sister seen them after getting off of work last night.  She is going to write down what actually  occurred.  She has a photo of one.  Poor shot I guess.  She drove to a darker part of town to view objects better.

I didn&#39;t think much of it at first since I see alot of helicopters and commercial aircraft every day in this area.  As I continued to watch this light in the eastern sky, it seemed to change color and the light almost looked as if it was revolving on top of whatever this thing was.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The next strange thing I noticed is that it was making no sound what so ever, and was definitely close enough that if it had been a helicopter or other commercial aircraft, it definitely would have been making noise.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I continued to watch this thing travel to the south when it made a total hairpin 90 degree turn and almost seemed to change shape as it went behind the tree.  I got up and went into my front yard and continued to watch this light change color and make what looked to be impossible movements in the sky, but traveling now to the east/southeast.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The craft appeared to lower up and down a few times, and then go back to the south.  It changed from blue/green to white and then to red before it traveled out of my vision behind a row of trees.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I can&#39;t be sure if the light or craft changed shape, but it looked as if it did for a second...but overall it seemed to maintain a triangle or teardrop shape throughout the sighting.<n>

All disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was walking outside to my car and noticed a large bright light in the sky to the East.  I saw a dim light to the right of it at a good distance and a dim light to the left and up higher at a distance.  It appeared to be an obtuse triangle perhaps.  I thought it was an unusual star formation perhaps.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The light to the right of the bright light grew brighter and larger.  I continued to watch it for 20 seconds or so as it grew larger.  When it reached the brightness and scale of the star to the left I thought it unusual.

The lights from this craft were absolutely beautiful and something I have never seen in my life.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It took me a moment to register what I had witnessed and I had dangerously lost focused of the road I was driving on and calculate I slowed my vehicle from 65 mph to about 30 to 35 mph in a 70 mph road.  Afraid I would cause a traffic accident, I gradually brought the vehicle to an appropriate speed and looked to my right to see if the object or craft would reappear again, but it was gone, and I decided to continue my journey home from work.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I work the overnight shift at a correctional institution as a correctional officer and I was glad as I thought about this incident that it did not happen during Halloween night or the hours of 12 midnight and 5 am with no sun about to appear it would have been a terrifying experience.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Please see other report from Texas for the same time and date.

11/1/14 06:40|Sulphur Springs|TX|Oval|10-15 seconds|Deer hunt spoiled by sudden appearance of 3 bright lights, surrounded by a dim amber ring of light.|11/6/14|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/115/S115175.html|536|ndxe201411| Deer hunt spoiled by sudden appearance of 3 bright lights, surrounded by a dim amber ring of light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About 20 minutes before daylight on Opening Day of the 2014 Deer Season here in Northeast Texas it was dark, no wind, no clouds, no moon, just star light &amp; I&#39;m straining to see my feeder through my binoculars when all of a sudden the entire area lit up like someone turned on flood lights.  I quickly raised my eyes over my binoculars and could see the light was all around the tree I&#39;m in too and its 80 yards from my deer feeder.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My immediate reaction was getting mad thinking someone must be driving up spot lighting ruining my hunt, but there was no noise plus the way the shadows were falling I realized the light was coming from above me.  That’s when I quickly look up and saw the 3 bright white lights moving West to East, and thought Wow! 3 shooting stars! EXCEPT that can&#39;t be either; they’re way too close and not moving fast.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I watched the lights drifting, cruising, in a triangular formation over the woods for a few seconds and then they started banking a turn to the South East moving away from me.  For a few seconds I could see a dim amber glowing ring of light surrounding the 3 bright white lights and then it just disappeared; like someone turned off all the lights at once.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After it disappeared, I kept looking into the dark star lit sky hoping to see its silhouette as it moved on, but saw nothing... Just stars and none of them were moving.  I never saw a profile of an aircraft, but when it turned the configuration of lights appeared to be aligned on the bottom of something round maneuvering like an aircraft banking a turn less than 100 yards from me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This all happened within a span of about 10 to 15 seconds, and I could hear my dog start barking in the distance at this same time, but no other sounds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I don&#39;t know what it was, but it happened &amp; I saw it from my tree stand at a time &amp; setting when I was wide awake with my senses tuned-in to every sound &amp; movement in the woods.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Opening day of the 2014 deer season is one I&#39;ll never forget.<n>
11/1/14 06:30|Chattanooga|TN|Unknown|3|Driving S on Browns Ferry Rd., before Browns Ferry Landing, I noticed to my right a plane flying about 2000ft over Raccon Mountain.|12/5/14|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/115/S115677.html|537|ndxe201411| Driving south on Browns Ferry Rd before Brownsferry Landing, I noticed to my right a plane flying about 2000ft over Raccoon Mountian heading northeast towards Chattanooga.  The plane had a blue light at the end of one wing and red light at the end of the other wing.  In the middle were two large white lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The plane flew directly over my car as I stopped on Browns Ferry RD.  As it flew past my position, I rolled down the window to hear it.  No sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It banked slightly right, then back left and continued over Tennessee River north side of Treatment Plant, then out of sight.  I have never seen a plane like that and thought it may have been a drone or something unusual.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Look like large car lights on the front of the plane or object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Time, date, and duration of the sighting appear to us to be flawed.

11/1/14 05:30|Laconia|NH|Unknown|10 minutes|unusual sound like a large invisible object rising from the ground into the sky;disturbed all dogs in neighborhood|11/14/14|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/115/S115352.html|538|ndxe201411| Unusual sound like a large invisible object rising from the ground into the sky; disturbed all dogs in neighborhood.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was walking my dog down my street and heard a loud noise, hard to describe, sort of like an engine or a huge compressor of some kind, starting at ground level about 1/8 mile in front of me, then as it grew louder, it also rose toward the sky, very weird.  The air felt charged again, hard to describe.  The sound grew louder until it seemed like it was very high above me, then faded quickly into the distance.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Immediately after it stopped, all the neighborhood dogs went crazy, even from inside houses I could hear them barking.  My own dog acted confused when he heard it, then also started barking when it stopped.  I got the sense that there was something in front of me making the noise even though I couldn&#39;t see it, and that it simply rose up and flew away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I returned from my walk, my mom asked me what the sound was, she thought maybe air brakes on a large semi truck.  Though the sound had that kind of quality to it, it was much louder and went straight up and no vehicles were on the street that could have made that sound.  It&#39;s something I have never heard before.<n>
11/1/14 03:50|Madison|WI|Light|10 seconds|As I was driving towards Madison, WI, I noticed a light moving across the sky.  It was just one single light, moving fast.|11/6/14|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/115/S115069.html|539|ndxe201411| As I was driving towards madison wi I noticed a light moving across the sky.  It was just one single light, it was moving faster than any plane I&#39;ve seen, when it suddenly completely stopped for about 4 seconds, then it shot towards the ground, went through a cloud, and completely dissipated it.<n>

11/1/14 01:20|San Marcos|TX|Chevron|~30 seconds|Chevron shaped object with rounded ends and internal glow flies over Texas City.|12/22/14|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/116/S116120.html|541|ndxe201411| Chevron shaped object with rounded ends and internal glow flies over Texas city<n> <n><n> <n><n> I really do not know any better way to describe what my friends and I saw that night.  It was a chevron shaped craft, looked to be about 50+ meters in size, had no lights on it nor did it make any sound.  It was just a bit lighter than the night time sky.  While having no lights, it appeared to have a faint glow moving about the craft as it flew over the city at a fairly quick speed.  The glow from inside was a blueish color.  The easiest way to describe the glow is to imagine the reflection of sunlight off water.  Here is a picture to give you an idea<n> <n><n> <n><n> http://www.learnamericanenglishonline.com/Word%20of%20the%20Day/WOD_images/water_reflection.jpg -<n> <n><n> <n><n> Imagine a solid black object with a faint blue glow moving about it like this pattern.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The duration of this event lasted about 30 seconds, from the point I noticed this craft, till the point it moved out of view.<n>
