A large came out of nowhere and hovered near us, perhaps as near as 800 feet away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object, as I recall, was oval in shape, with lights around the perimeter.  The size of the object was perhaps 300 feet in length.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My friend and I watched for perhaps two minutes, before the object moved unbelievably fast out of sight over the Atlantic Ocean.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Both my friend and I were extremely scared of what we saw and ran for cover immediately after the sighting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We reported the incident to the local radio station which had received other sighting reports.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have watched a number of UFO show on television, but never have I seen in incident where one had been sighted as close to the ground as the one that we saw that day.<n>
10/10/61 19:00|Bristol|TN|Sphere|5 Minutes|My father is now 89 my brother 52 the girl with us now 51 myself 49 and the other fellow which worked with my father if he's still livi|4/27/07|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/055/S55782.html|2|ndxe196110| My father is now 89 my brother 52 the girl with us now 51 myself 49 and the other fellow which worked with my father if he&#39;s still living would be ~79.  They managed and ran a radio station in Bristol Tennessee.  I vividly remember and just to make sure asked my father and brother to describe if they remember and they without coaching remember exactly what I do. We were driving in an old Buick roadmaster convertable in the country as my father was taking us all for an ice cream then a drive in the country.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I and both my brother and father to this day recall it there was a spike that went over our auto it was bright white pulsating with what looked like cylinders protruding out of it. My father stopped the car on the country road and parked we watched it and it appeared to come down just over a hill by the roadside which we had parked. My father and the guy that worked with him at the staion got out left us 3 kids in the car and they hopped a fence and went over to have a look. After about 2 or 3 minutes they came back and as they were approaching the car the sphere shot up over head very quickly very brightly and quietly as it left. To this day we all recall it like it was yesterday. My father and the fellow working with him went back saw where the craft had been and stated that it &#34;laid down the grass&#34; where it had been. Again this is a child hood memory which I will always remember as my UFO experience. They did NOT report this as they didn&#39;t want to be portrayed as Kooks.<n> <n><n> <n><n> However we know what we saw, no there were no creatures or beings seen but we will never forget this experience.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness does not indicate that the date of the incident is approximate, although we assume that the date indicated may be an estimate.

10/1/61 22:00|Graham|NC|Triangle|30 seconds|3 flat, large  white lights in delta pattern, no sound, flying at tree-top level at 35-40 mph|5/14/02|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/022/S22703.html|3|ndxe196110| 3 flat, large  white lights in delta pattern, no sound, flying at tree-top level at 35-40 mph<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I exited my car and was walking toward my front door, I glanced up to the sky and was surprised to see three large circles of white light in a triangular pattern sailing tree-top level over some trees in my side yard.  I walked out into the yard for a better view and didn&#39;t feel fearful since &#34;it&#34; was flying away from me in a southwest/northeast direction at approximately 35-40 mph.  The light was a flat type with no projection.  Perhaps the strangest thing I noticed, in addition to the whole senario, was the absence of any sound.  I didn&#39;t see any structure around the lights but they were in a triangular/delta pattern.  I watched it until it disappeared, then went into the house and called my boyfriend who lived 1-2 miles away in the direction that the ufo was traveling.  He looked out but saw nothing.  For a day or two, I watched the newspaper for any other reported sightings, but saw none.  All I can say is, I know what I saw and I don&#39;t care if anybody believes me or not.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>
10/1/61 19:00|Nashville|TN|Disk|30 minutes|In October 1961, a silvery flattened disk hovered motionless over a local school fair for more than 30 minutes.|8/5/12|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/091/S91468.html|4|ndxe196110| In October 1961, a silvery flattened disk hovered motionless over a local school fair for more than 30 minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I saw an unidentified flying object in the fall of 1961 or 1962. I was 11 or 12 years old at the time, and I was attending a fall fair with my parents at my elementary school.  Several hundred people were in attendance at this fair.  There were numerous rides for the kids and there were plenty of colored flashing lights all over the place.  One of my friend&#39;s dad was an amateur astronomer and had set up his telescope for people to see the moon and the planets.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At some point, a UFO appeared out of nowhere.  It was a silvery flattened disk with 2 or 3 portholes on the side. It was not a shiny silver color but had a sort of dullness to it.  It remained completely motionless over the large field where the fair was in progress.  It had an oscillating glow between red and green.  I cannot recall how high the UFO was but you could see it fairly well with the naked eye.  Many people observed the UFO through the telescope.  When I looked through the telescope, I could see that it appeared to be fairly bright inside the UFO but I did not see any life or movement inside.  Some one placed a call to either the local police or to the Tennessee Air National Guard which was located just a few miles away from the school. Two (2) jets were scrambled, and you could hear them approaching very quickly.  As they approached, the UFO took off at a very oblique angle, no sound was made, and the departure was faster than you could blink your eyes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am now 62 years old, and I have never forgotten that night.  From time to time, I have tried to find information on the internet about this incident but without success.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

10/1/61 03:30|Tulsa|OK|Disk|2 minutes|October, 1961, Tulsa Oklahoma: low altitude, slow, disk object(s); high speed turns, v. high accelleration.|4/27/07|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/056/S56354.html|5|ndxe196110| October, 1961, Tulsa Oklahoma: low altitude, slow, disk object(s); high speed turns, v. high accelleration.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was delivering newspapers at approximately 3:30 AM, October 1, 1961, (plus of minus a week), on North Braden Avenue at the corner of East Marshal Street.  It was cold (30-35F) and the sky was clear of clouds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Two circular, saucer-shaped objects flew over me in a North-East direction, generally headed toward the Tulsa airport approximately two and a half miles away.  My estimate at the time was that they were flying at about 250 feet altitude, and were about 80 feet across.  It was relatively easy to judge the distance, as the edges of the saucers were crisply in focus.  There was very faint scoring or scratching on the bottom surface of the saucers, giving a slight textured appearance, which also allowed me to judge altitude better.  They flew at approximately 15-20 MPH (very slowly), and in line (one behind the other, same altitude).  The bottom of the saucers glowed with a golden light that pulsed slowly, in about a 2-3 second cycle from dimmer to lighter and back to dimmer.  The pulsing was very distinct, but not the cycle was not &#34;wide,&#34; in that it was never particularly bright, and always a bit dim.  The saucers were completely silent.  There were no &#34;point&#34; lights, or particular light emitting locations except for the whole of the under surface.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The location was very slightly hilly, and the saucers proceeded in a direction directly in line with the street.  I would watch clearly them until they had flown about a mile and a half away.  As they receded, it became apparent that the main bodies of the saucers had the appearance of two thin spherical surfaces, one above and one below, meeting at the edges.  Given the estimate that the saucers were 80 feet in diameter, I estimate that the main body of the saucers were 8 feet thick.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The main body of each saucer was surmounted by a translucent (opaque) white dome, rising approximately 4 feet above the main body.  The dome was only a little brighter than the golden bottoms.  There were no &#34;point&#34; sources of light on the dome.  I do not recall that the top surface of the saucers, apart from the domes, glowed; however, it is likely that they did glow only a little dimmer than the bottoms or I would have noticed either that they were dark or that the saucer bodies were uniformly bright, top and bottom.  I do not recall that the dome lighting pulsed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It is possible that my size estimates are too small.  It is possible that the saucers were instead, 125 feet across and 12 feet thick in the main body with a 6-7 foot dome, flying up to but not exceeding 400 feet in altitude.  These sizes are an upper limit and unlikely.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At the time I was skilled in aircraft recognition, having been growing up with a parent who was employed at the Tulsa Airport and who kept me well informed about airplanes and air flight mechanics.  I was also a relatively skilled hunter, with a good sense of distance for estimating bullet trajectories for high powered rifles.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Naturally, I thought this to be an extraordinary incident, and so I kept my eyes on the sky for many mornings thereafter.  Subsequently, within two or three weeks I saw another saucer, which I will report here as part of the same incident.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was standing at the corner of East Pine and North Yale, approximately half a mile North of the previous sighting, and saw a saucer fly overhead in a South-West direction toward downtown Tulsa, 4 miles away.  The location was elevated sufficiently so that I could see the downtown skyline.  The saucer was the same size and shape, but this time flying silently at 750-1000 feet altitude at perhaps 200-250 MPH.  It glowed with a golden pulsing light, as had the two saucers in the previous sighting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Within perhaps 1 to 1-1/2 minutes, the saucer passed just even with or to the other side of the downtown region and turned Northward at probably the same speed.  From this distance it was a little easier to estimate the altitude, as the profile of the saucer was relatively clear, although distant and therefore a small visual object.  The saucer flew Northward for about a mile, until more or less directly East of me, then abruptly changed both direction and speed.  The saucer abruptly veered upward at about 25 degrees -- a &#34;point-turn&#34; with no curvature to it that I could detect from where I was.  It abruptly increased in speed to what I would estimate to be about 1500 MPH.  I judge this to be the speed from the prior assessment that it was going 250 MPH, and was not going 6-8 times that speed, upward at the 25 degree angle.  It seemed that the saucer accelerated from 250 to 1500 in not more than a few hundred feet, if it took even that distance.  For all I knew, it was instantaneous, since one or two saucer-body lengths in acceleration to that speed would have been indistinguishable from instantaneous.  The saucer continued upward rapidly until I could no longer see it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Within one week more, I saw something that I presumed to be a saucer, also.  From the same location at Pine and Yale, I looked into the sky Southward and a little East, and saw high into the sky (about 55-60 degrees elevation) what appeared to be a meteor entering the atmosphere -- a not uncommon sight.  However, this meteor began to glow, then streaked down at about 150-160 degrees downward Upper Left to Lower Right in my vision, then abruptly slowed and stopped in place, still glowing brightly from what I thought to be heated entry into the atmosphere.  After remaining completely still for approximately 10 seconds, it flew off horizontally to the horizon, Eastward (probably South-East from its stopped position) and disappeared into the distance.  I could not see features on this object, nor its shape.  The event was probably 8-10 miles distant, perhaps in an area 1-3 miles West of Broken Arrow, Oklahoma.<n> <n><n> <n><n> These three events were the only ones I saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

10/1/61 03:00|Toledo|OH|Sphere|2-3 mins.|Observed dull silver metallic sphere hovering outside of bedroom window as a child.  Had direct communication with sphere.|11/19/98|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/004/S04810.html|6|ndxe196110| Observed dull silver metallic sphere hovering outside of bedroom window as a child.  Had direct communication with sphere.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In October 1961, I awoke from a sound sleep with a feeling the something was in my room.  I was 7 years old.  My older brother (11 yrs) was already awake and he pointed towards a light behind the metal venetian blinds of our first floor bedroom window.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I felt compelled to look behind the blind slats.  When I did I was face-to-face with a dull silver metalic sphere approximately 18-24 inches in diameter.  The sphere was hovering silently and motionless right next to the window glass (single-pane glass with a metal frame).<n> <n><n> <n><n> The sphere had a recessed rectangular panel (approx 10 inches across by 3-4 inches high).  There were red dots (unkonwn numer and pattern) and there was a very bright white light at the right and left sides of the panel.  (Two lights total).  The lights were the color and intensity of examiination lights in a dentist&#39;s office or in an operating room.  (At the time I had never seen either type of medical lights before).<n> <n><n> <n><n> The sphere hovered motionless and I was in direct communication with the sphere.  It was a very strange sense of consciousness that I never experienced before the event.  I was paralyzed and was in a one-way communication with the sphere.  It was telling me things in my head without audible words.  I was unable to understand specifically what was being said, but it was very important that I listen to the messages.  I believe there were at least four simulataneous &#34;voices&#34; talking at the same time in Engilish as I stared into the sphere.  It was a multi-voice message.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My brother was not involved in this contact.  The sphere slowly began to rotate silently  away from me to my right.  As it rotated, the lights went off.  The sphere&#39;s motion was very smooth and silent.  It rose more rapidly and disappeared into the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My brother did not look out the window as far as I know.  I still look out the window evey night before I go to bed and whenever I wake up during the night to check for something.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am now 44 years old.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Has anyone else seen a sphere such as this?<n>
