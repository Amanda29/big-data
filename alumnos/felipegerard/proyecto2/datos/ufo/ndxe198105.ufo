Huachuca. We&#39;re walking along and since the skies here in AZ are so dark the stars are like a blanket at times--when this huge wedge with lights (7) along the front edge and behind it you could not see the stars in a definite wedge shape blackout. It slowly and silently passed and I looked a him and he looked at me and we both were like &#34;Did you see what I saw?&#34; We confirmed it. The thing was huge, it was I&#39;d say at least 1000 feet to each wing of the wedge, if not more. it was about a half mile away about two o&#39;clock over the East Range of Ft. Huachuca and proceeded from the Southeast towards Green Valley/Tucson/Casa Grande to the northwest.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We watched it for two or three minutes and went and told our other friend and pretty much never told anybody else.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am a land surveyor and consider myself a good judge of distance also I was an Army brat and have seen flares all my life, flares don&#39;t move in unison.  I alway put this down to a B-2 stealth bomber sighting, until I saw one and found out how small they are.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

I opened my back door and saw a saucer shaped object coming toward my house. I was terrified. I watched for a while as it came closer. It was within a short diatance from my house. The lights seemed mostly out and it was hovering moving slowly. I called my husband who was in a meeting and he told me not to be so loud they could hear me. I said I didn&#39;t care. He said he would be home in a minute and I said I won&#39;t be here. I have never been so scared. I looked out one more time and it was coming directly over my house. I could have taken a broom and thrown it and hit the craft. I shut the door and never opened it again that night. I was too scared. I remember it vividly! It was disk shaped, dark (black) in color. You could hear the engines or noise from the craft inside my house with the doors shut. In fact, my husband could hear it over the phone when I called him!<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am a retired teacher of 35 years.  I retired last year 2007. I still do the After School Program at my school.  I started teaching at 20 and retired at 55.  I am married, not to the same man I talked to the night of 1981.  I have one child who is attending college.  I am very involved in church.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As far as I know, I never talked to any one at the time.  I don&#39;t know why?  I was having some personal problems.  I guess I thought people would think I was crazy, but I know what I saw.  It was right in front of my eyes not far up in the sky!  My husband now wanted to ride by where this happened and he noted that behind the house accross the street was an open field.  I had never thought of that. It is still an open field.  He thought it might have needed to land and that was what it was doing?????  I don&#39;t know but there is one thing I am positve of and that is I saw a space craft close up!<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

They made a left &amp; I made a right, after traveling only a short distance, maybe 3-5 miles I noticed the object to my north moving very slowly &amp; horizontaly. To my right was a large pasture surounded by tall pine trees, the road was a small 2 lane black top. It moved from the north traveling south where it passed over the road approx. 1/8 of a mile ahead of me. It was pitch black &amp; no around but me, it was so bright my head lights were washed out &amp; lit up my entire car &amp; about the size of a split level home. There was absolutely no sound, I watched it move off to the south &amp; out of sight. For a few mintues I sat in my car wondering what I had just seen, but to this day I have no idea. I work in the aviation field &amp; I&#39;ve never encountered an aircraft that is completely silent.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date may be approximate.  PD))<n>

Was driving slowly on Wiley Lane, facing due north. A silver torpedo-shaped craft flew slowly and silently east-to-west just over the tree-tops, perhaps at 200ft. (Tall pines were growing on either side of the narrow street....appeared to be close to their tops.) There were no markings or windows or obvious sources of propulsion. Don&#39;t recall hearing any engine sounds. Was shocked that a military aircraft would be allowed to fly SO LOW over a populated area with the possibility of impacting buildings, tall trees or other small airborn aircraft!!! DISCLAIMER: Date-year is NOT exact (may be off by a year, before or after). Was definitely in spring or summer.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

Although at the time I went to the Police station and reported the sighting and told everyone for days.  (No one really believed me), so in all these years I mainly keep it to myself.  Now i&#39;m older I think the encounter was actually quite significate.  I was 18 yrs old at the time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is what happened: I was driving back home from work at night.  I worked in Salisbury and lived in Warminster (30min drive).  I came over a brow of a hill (at the top of the hill) which then went around to the right.  There just starting to cross over the road right to left was a UFO.  It was at lampost height, as long as a bus and the best way to descibe it is; similar to some of the pictures you see being drawn of them, a flying saucer.  It was going very slow and it was that low I braked and stopped the car.  I then sat there and watch it cross over.  (It was country side either side of the road).  It had port holes/windows on the middle section with lights that could be seen inside.  But there was a very distintive thing about it and that was the noise.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It made a very deep intermitted humming noise, which at a guess must have been its engines.  Being so close there was no mistaken the fact on what it was.  I can still picture the craft in my mind now after all these years and relise that I am quite lucky to have exterienced that.  It doesn&#39;t really bother me that people don&#39;t beieve you,  I&#39;m now married with kids and tell them the story and they don&#39;t belive me either.  Anyway I know what I saw, it was that close there was no mistaken it for anything else.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date is approximate.  PD))<n>

5/9/81 00:00|Scottsdale|AZ|Fireball|4 hours|An orange fireball above our backyard|7/5/05|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/044/S44630.html|9|ndxe198105| An orange fireball above our backyard<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;m not sure what month it was, nor the day.  Even the year is foggy.  But I do remember my brother had left for college, so I must have been a Junior in high school.  I had shelves built in to the wall at the foot of my bed.  Suddenly, in the middle of the night, I awoke to a crashing sound on my floor.  I leapt out of bed, headed for the light switch, and flipped it on while runningout the door (feared the boogie man).  As I tried to excape, I ran into my mom who was standing just outside my bedroom door.  She scared me half to death too, since her room was on the opposite end of the house...and she was not the type to check and see what went boom in the night.  I couldn&#39;t figure out how she got there so quickly.  I then turned around, out of breath, to see what the noise was.  My shelves had fallen to the floor with all the books, etc...  Relieved, I said, something to the effect of, &#34;Oh, thank God, it was just my books.  I flipped off the switch and went back to bed, leaving my mom in the doorway.  She turned the light back on and said, Karen, look out your window, in a monotonous tone.  Now, this is coming from a hyper melodramatic woman.  Again, &#34;Karen, look out your window.&#34;  I yelled back like the brat that I was, &#34;Mom, it was just my books, I&#39;m trying to sleep.  I&#39;ll clean it up tomorrow. Now, turn off my light!&#34;  And she repeated herself again, &#34;Karen, look out your window.&#34;  This went on a couple of more times, until I huffed and crawled to the end of my bed, opened the blinds and said, &#34;What?&#34;  At that very moment, I saw a huge fireball about a hundred yards above our back yard.  It was partically over ours, and the house behind us. I was wowed, and instantly thought that we should call somebody, but I didn&#39;t know who.  Just to report it, or to see if someone else had seen it, or, I thought, perhaps it was there just for us.   I wasn&#39;t afriad of it.  I thought it was cool. She said that there was no point in calling,that no one would believe us, or someon else would have called in by then.   She said, &#34;Yeah, I&#39;ve been watching it for hours.  It hovering above our yard like that, then it just... and at that very instant, it seemed to respond to her words.  It took off way across the infinite skyline and became the size of a pea, then it zoomed all over the sky and soon anough came back to our backyard, only slightly higher and further away this time.  I ended up getting in my moms bed with her so that I could watch it through binoculars out her sliding glass doors.  It didn&#39;t look like fire through the binoculars.  It was not of this earth.  I frustrated me, because I wanted to label it, even the colour seemed to change to various shades of orange.  I&#39;m not sure, but I think I remember seeing a little red.  The colour hovered around the ball, like a tangile hue. I watched it for hours.  I oinged all over the sky, then land slightly further away, over and over and over, until I fell asleep.  I never talked about it again, my mom and I never spoke of it.  Many years later, whenI was about thirty, I called my mom after years of not speaking to her.  I asked for two things; 1) my birth certificate and 2) I wanted to know about what she saw.  She said, oh, that thing.  Who knows what that was.  It could have been anything.  HALLO!!!!!<n>

5/1/81 20:00|San Diego|CA|Triangle|1 hour|I saw 5 UFO's this night, thanks to my girlfriend at the time who was connected to them. This was 1981.  She took me out to watch them.|1/28/99|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/005/S05078.html|11|ndxe198105| I saw 5 UFO&#39;s this night, thanks to my girlfriend at the time who was connected to them. This was 1981.  She took me out to watch them...I saw 35 in total over 6 mo. I was taken aboard twice, once conciously. They said &#34;we always welcome you&#34; as I went in. I was taken out of my body once and taken aboard also. Since then, I have had many dreams of them....Now,  am a well paid professional, and this is the first time I have discussed this outside of my family. I am very paranoid that this is a govt site. Im taking a chance, I have had many experiences with them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> First event: My girlfriend took me to see them. A large triangular object that flew over our head..It was huge and only a few hundred yards above. It was totally silent...I only saw &#34;running lights&#34; along the edges and triangular shapes along the bottom of the ship. Afterwards, I saw many circular globular objects that were gold in color, that flew perpindicular to the other craft. My girlfriend at the time was connected to them and always knew when they were around. This was 1981 She took me to the desert soon after,  and told me I would be taken aboard consciously...not unconsciously. We camped there. I saw appproximately 17 UFO&#39;s fly over this place. They were landing on the other side of the mountains, We were in a van...they came about midnight. A fog descended around our Van, and I looked out the window and saw aliens walking,,,I totally panicked..I was begging to go asleep.... The next thing I know, I was awake the next mornig, My girlfriends&#39; first words were &#34;did you enjoy yourself last nite&#34; I remember the dream though. They floated me aboard, and as I was going in they said &#34; we always welcome you&#34; I was in a dream state...and in a small room...I was thinking to myself...&#34;.they cant keep me here&#34; so I walked out the door and around the perimiter of the ship which had windows all about. there was no one there... I kept thinking that when I came in it was such a small ship, but once inside, this ship was huge...I came to the bridge, and saw two chairs, and lights all around. Then I went to another room with a large crystaline object with tubes coming out indifferent directionss. someone said this was the propulsion device. Then, I found myself in front of a screen of sorts, with a female alien next to me. On the screen, were objects and symbols that were flying by. I asked her &#34;why are you showing me this, I dont know what it means&#34; She said &#34;you will need it later&#34; I asked her is there going to be nuclear war, and she said &#34;no, we will prevent it&#34; Remember, this is 1981. And I saw myself watching  medical procedures...they were taking people from campsites and impregnating women, and mixing the husbands sperm with theirs...creating pregnancies. I  left her a year later and have not seen a UFO since....that was 1982. whatever they wanted  with me,, they must have accomplished. I have kept this a secret beyond my family fo 15 yeas I have other experiences, but I am so afraid that this is a govt site....I am a well paid medical professional, with a family and a nice house. This is the first time I have made my experience known beyond my family since  the 80&#39;s....Even my family doesn&#39;t believe me except one  brother who has had similar experiences. I just have not talked about it for 15 years untill now. Please keep me confidential ((Address deleted))<n>

The object looked like what I thought for many years was a metiorite. It had a hot molten look to it with a firey like tail. I was amazed when it didn&#39;t hit the mountain. It flew the length of the Boulder Mall, a very busy place and there was never any mention of it so I just kept quiet. Until I learned that these fire balls have been reported as possiblely vehicles. The point at which it disappeared would be Pearl St. at the base of boulder canyon. The Ball seemed to have a crator like surface.<n>
