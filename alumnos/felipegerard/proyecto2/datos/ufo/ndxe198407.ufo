July 31, 1984, I know date because I&#39;d just left my parents&#39; house in Newtown after watching CBS&#39;s &#34;60 Minutes&#34; with Mom &amp; Dad, and a movie...10 pm...I passed exit 16, the sky was misty &amp; rainy ... rounded a curve, saw a bright light coming in from my right (directly over the airport, heading east with me and descending fast)...it came over some trees, I saw it thru the windshield. My first thought: airplane about to circle around and go to the airport. It crossed my windshield as I started up a 25-degree grade toward the South St. bridge, a large Arch Bridge over 84 with a police tower adjacent to the bridge. As I was driving toward the bridge, the object &#34;Stopped instantly on a dime&#34; directly over the bridge, in front of me. For 1 second, my thought was &#34;oh! a VTOL (Vertical Take-Off or Landing Aircraft....Jets used usually on ships in the Navy)then after 1 second, I instantly realized it was a UFO! I was driving right AT IT! My heart came up into my mouth, as I realized I had seconds to decide if I could turn around, but the median there wouldn&#39;t allow it, I would&#39;ve gotten stuck. I then decided to &#34;floor it&#34; and go right under it. Then I decided this might be the only time I might ever see one, so I forced myself to pull over. I watched it for 15 mins. It was about double the size of a 2-story house. It appeared to me to be shaped like a tetrahedron, with one upper side cut out of it. Many lights, different colors, all over it, about 20 lights, looked like typical Christmas tree lights, including purple, yellow, red, blue, green, white. As I pulled over, it was perfectly still over the bridge, was VERY low, and after a few mins it moved over very slowly to the tower and hovered there. I felt like I was DEFINITELY being watched, and was totally terrified. My body was violently shaking like I was cold, it was hard to control my shaking. The ter! m &#34;deer in headlights&#34; crossed my mind. I saw cars and trucks going by, and I have a photograph in my head of a split second shot of two people going by me at 60 m.p.h. and looking up at the UFO. The object was so low, I had the feeling that if I had a baseball, I &#34;just about&#34; could have hit it. Definitely could have with a sling-shot. The object was rotating slowly, and I unrolled my window. All I heard was crickets when there were no cars. I had a 1-Million candle-light power super flashlight plugged into my cigarette lighter, next to my right knee on the passengers&#39; side floor and it crossed my mind to fire a light on this thing, and I &#34;just could not&#34; get up the will to do it, I started shaking more just thinking about it. I was cursing myself for not having my camera bag, I am a photographer - hobbyist, and usually carry it with me. I could see what appeared to be a large &#34;hole&#34; in the darkness behind the lights, and a definite grill-work pattern with pipes and such along the bottom, and smooth sides, but it was hard to see from the brightness. I remember being amazed thinking &#34;this was NOT made on this planet!&#34; The object very slowly moved away from the tower, traveling directly over 84 West opposite me, then after passing me picked up speed. I didn&#39;t move at first. I looked into my rear-view mirror, saw it, then carefully opened the door, stood up and put my elbow on the car roof, and watched it disappear over the horizon toward Southbury and Newtown. I then drove down the hill to exit 17, called my parents and I remember waking my Dad. I told him what I&#39;d seen, we discussed it for a few mins., then I went home to my Waterbury apartment. I sat down in the dark at my kitchen table, looked out the window, watched the light from Waterbury coming in the window ....and sort of daydreamed about the whole incident for a bit...then I looked at my watch and it was 3:30 am !! I do not know if I had a missing time episode or not. I did call Oxford airport, but I don&#39;t recall if it was that night or the next ! morning. My Father is now deceased, so I can&#39;t ask if he remembers what time I called him. My Mother does not remember the episode...I don&#39;t know if she woke up or not when I called. I was a disc-jockey at a Waterbury radio station at the time, and I asked the audience a few nights later if they&#39;d seen anything...I received about a dozen phone calls, one I remember particularly about a couple who saw one on the Merritt Parkway the same night. At the time, I had no clue that there was a &#34;Hudson Valley&#34; UFO flap going on.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
7/31/84 22:00|Middlebury|CT|Other|15 mins|Sun. July 31, 1984 10-pm sighting Middlebury CT over Police tower I-84 next to South St. arch bridge|4/27/04|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/036/S36316.html|2|ndxe198407| Sun. July 31, 1984 10-pm sighting Middlebury CT over Police tower I-84 next to South St. arch bridge<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had an experience in 1984 I will never forget.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My name is ((name deleted)). I am now 44, in 1984 I was 24, and at the time I was a D-J at a radio station in central Connecticut. It was a Sunday night, summertime, I know it was July 31st, 1984. I had just visited my parents, watched 60 minutes (thats how I remember it was a Sunday night; at the time I remember thinking it was at the beginning of the month, but I looked it up on a perpetual calendar and realized it was a few hours before August 1st.) and I watched a movie with them, and left about 10 o&#39;clock and drove home on I-84. My parents lived in Newtown and I in Waterbury. Driving up thru Middlebury, past exit 16, I saw what I thought was a plane coming down fast to my right, in the corner of my eye. As I drove up a grade, the &#34;plane&#34; came down over some pine trees, and I was approaching a large Arch bridge in front of me about a quarter of a mile ahead. The &#34;plane&#34;  &#34;stopped on a dime&#34; instantaneously above the bridge !  For about 1/8th of a second I thought it was a military jet called a VTOL  (Vertical take off or landing) -- there is Oxford airport about a mile away to my right at this point -- and so I thought, &#34;Oh !  A  VTOL !!&#34;  And then, in that 1/8th of a second, my heart came up into my throat !!!  It&#39;s not a VTOL but a freakin&#39; UFO  !!! And I am driving at 65 m.p.h. -- RIGHT TOWARDS IT !!!   It scared the ((deleted)) me so much I was trying in those few seconds to figure out how to turn around, but the ditch to the other side of the highway was too steep, I&#39;d get stuck in my Ford Escort if I tried it. So, my next thought was to floor it --- fly at high speed right under the bridge and UFO -- but as I got up to it, I was then thinking, this might be the ONLY chance I ever get to see something like this, so I mustered all my nerve and found a place to pull over. I sat there for what I thought was 15 minutes, virtually frozen in my seat, scared to death, watching this thing move slowly to the other side of the highway over a large police radio tower next to the bridge ...  it was only a few hundred feet from me... I felt I could have hit it with a rock or a baseball if I&#39;d had the nerve. Well, it hovered, turned -- rotated, actually -- very slowly, and I unwound my window and heard NO sound, just crickets and cars passing by. I looked at two as they went by, I remember seeing the people looking up at it, and thinking I wasn&#39;t the only person seeing this. The proverbial &#34;deer in the headlights&#34; phrase kept going thru my mind. It was larger than a two-story house, just floating there, and I definitely had the feeling I was being watched, I was NEVER so scared in my entire life. It had what looked like a notch cut out of one side of it, otherwise it seemed almost round, but there were actually flat sides to it, like a dodecahedron, with what I would describe as xmas tree lights all over it, but much more brighter and more brilliant, brilliant colors of blue, red, yellow, purple, all kinds of colors. I could also see what looked like metal-work on it behind the lights, like, beams or something, and I remember thinking WOW, this is something not made on this planet ! The thing floated there for 15 minutes, or so I thought.... because it then moved slowly away, disappeared over a hill, and I drove home, went up to my apartment, drained from this, but I couldn&#39;t sleep, so I sat down in my dark apartment at my kitchen table, sat there for what I thought was 10 -15 mins., looked at my watch and was stunned to see it was 3:30 am !!   So what happened to the time ?? I still do not know, I am now looking into some hypnosis sessions to find out what happened, my sister knows a woman who does hypnosis. Anyway, although the experience scared the living crap out of me at the time, I was glad to have experienced it because it gave me insight into the fact that not only are we NOT alone, but that how insignificant things can be on this lonely little planet in a corner of the Universe in the grand scheme of things.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Not that things aren&#39;t important here, but just to know that there are many other things going on we have NO clue about in the vastness of space. And not only that, but at least I &#34;know&#34; in my heart what &#34;I saw&#34;  and no one can take that away from me,even if they don&#39;t believe me at least I believe what I myself saw. The next night, I got on the radio and asked if anyone had seen anything and got 4 or 5 calls from people who&#39;d seen similar looking UFOs the night before, one down near the Merritt Parkway and another near Waterbury I remember.<n>

We visited with them and left for home.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were traveling on Highway 50 heading East and as we were leaving the edge of Rosebud, Missouri, heading towards Gerald, Mo., I looked to my right, out of the passenger side window, and saw this cigar like figure that seemed to be on fire, a red, orange and yellowish flame, streaming along and traveling at the same speed that we were traveling down the highway, and it was traveling above tree level.  It seemed to be as long as a football field.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As we traveled down the highway it seemed to be angling closer to us. Then all of a sudden, it hovered above Mr. M&#39;s house and trees,right along the highwy just right in front of us, at tree top level, hovered there.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I told my husband lets get the heck out of here, and when I said that, it vanished in thin air........almost like something heard me.....…<n> <n><n> <n><n> We had called a friend of ours that worked in the control tower at the Vichy, Mo. Airport and told him what we saw.  He told us that other people had called in and saw it too.  Then if I recall, on Channel 5 news, they said that it was a Russian Rocket on fire re-entering earth&#39;s atmosphere...I never heard of a burning Rocket hovering (????????????) in place for 30 seconds or so.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After that, I asked my husband, did you see what I saw and he said yes and then he asked me the same question and I answered I sure did.  Later that evening, I called my sister-in-law and told her what had happened.  She told me, oh my God, My Mom and Dad just got back from Florida and the same object had followed them home to Rosebud, Missouri.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I just wonder what that thing was???????  Something that was on a mission of some sort????????<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of sighting is approximate.

7/25/84 20:00|Suffolk|VA|Sphere|5-10 minutes|Large, orangey colored sphere rose slowly from behind trees in the distance and traveled silently across the sky.|11/8/05|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/047/S47449.html|4|ndxe198407| Large, orangey colored sphere rose slowly from behind trees in the distance and traveled silently across the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This happened when i was a kid-(im almost 35 now.)  I know i was around 13 or 14, and my little brother and his friend,who was spending the nite, (both around 10 at that time)-were outside after dark, probably around 8ish or so one nite during the summer.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We lived in rural Suffolk, and on a long dirt road.  Our house was surrounded by some open fields, and after those were lots of woods.  So, we were out there goofing off, and one of us notices this bright, orangey colored ball of light rising off in the distance.  I cant say for certain, but im certain this light was at least several miles away from us.  But this &#39;ball&#39; still looked huge.  It just rose slowly, straight upwards--not sideways, not at an angle, but straight up in the sky.  This color was orangy, but could be described as an orangy-yellowish color too.  It was very bright, and VERY noticeable.  It was like watching the sun rise, except you could look at it, or like how a basketball might look big in the sky if you could float it at a distance in the air of around 2 or 3 storys high--That&#39;s how large it looked, even though it was obviously at a distance of several miles away from us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I do not recall if it pulsated or anything like that--im pretty certain that it did not, but i know that the color never changed, nor did the shape change at all.  The boys ran inside to get my folks.  My mom came out figuring it was probably an airplane or something.  However, she was just as puzzled, excited, and scared of this as we were.  She had no clue what it could be.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We realized that the object was not rising any longer.  It was moving horizontally now, and towards us somewhat.  It was moving at a VERY slow, non-hurried speed.  When we realized it was moving towards us, my mom sent my brother in to get our dad.  The object was travelling more sideways than towards us.  It got closer, but not much.  We just stood there, watching it as it slooooowly made it way across the nite sky in front of us.  We could hear nothing at all!<n> <n><n> <n><n> After a minute or so of trying to convince our dad no one was pullin his leg, he came out like mom did at first--expecting to see an airplane or helicopter.  Instead, he caught a quick site of it as it finally disappeared over the tops of trees in the distance and we could no longer see it.  He TOO was mystifyied as to what it was.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have never to this day seen anything that even remotely resembles it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

Although it had occurred some 20 years ago I feel it is significant enough to mention.  He stated that while he was in a rooming house he got to know a man there that always seemed to be disturbed about something.  He also appeared to show a great deal of anxiety.<n> <n><n> <n><n> One day while my friend and the man were talking the man admitted that there was a time in his life when he was normal as any other average person.  It all changed one day while he was hunting in the Watchung Mountains region.  While he was in the woods he encountered a creature that he described as being &#34;not from this world&#34;.  It frightened him significantly.  He yelled at the creature to leave.  When the creature did not he tried to shoot at it with his gun.  However, the gun jammed.  This terrified him even more.  The man became upset during this part of the conversation and did not want to talk about the experience anymore.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Since much time had passed my friend has lost contact with the man.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have known my friend for some time and do know him well.  I have always found him to be a honest, level headed, and straight forward person.  He believes the man to be credible.  Also, the event affected him severely which seems to indicate that it did indeed occur.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
7/25/84 04:00|Terre Haute|IN|Other|1 hour|Glowing Arrowhead Shape Craft with Glowing white Trail|9/19/02|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/025/S25145.html|6|ndxe198407| Glowing Arrowhead Shape Craft with Glowing white Trail<n> <n><n> <n><n> I worked until 2 a.m. at my job, outside city limits. We also lived outside the city limits at this time. Getting home, I turned on the TV for relaxing. Around 4 a.m., I felt I could finally go to sleep. My cat wasn&#39;t in the house and fearing the roaming dogs, I went ouside to look for it. I went out the back door, which faces east, walked around to the front, which faces west, looing down at the ground, under shrubs, etc. for the cat. The cat was out front under a bush and as I bent down to pick it up, out of the corner of my eye, I saw a bright white light light in the sky, which my mind said was the crack of dawn. Then as I fondled the cat in my arms, I realized that dawn would appear out in back, or the eastern sky, and this was west. I looked up at the southwest sky. There was a thick bright white trail, solid without separation waves, that a jet might leave. We have 3 big &#39;cedar type&#39; trees in the front yard so I shifted my looking past the 2nd. tree, saw more of the trail, then past the 3rd. tree, saw more of the trail but followed it with my eyes to the north west sky. I was dumbstruck, startled to see an arrow head shaped object, glowing a brilliant white as with an enormous amount of heat,  at the head of the trail. It was moving slowly, as if encountering a force. It went on beyond my sight. The trail was still in tact and visible when I finally went inside. The object might have been heading towards Chicago... or beyond. It was huge, even from the distance. I&#39;m sure it was as high as the commercial jet planes that fly over our house. A few years later, I read the front page of a &#39;scandal rag&#39; type newspaper while waiting in line at a supermarket. It had an interview from a physcic who told about this object and another incident I&#39;d seen, a storm where a huge black storm cloud hung over a power plant and lightening produced a constant stream of what looked like Hebrew letters. I too, saw that, from my workplace window. This physcic said a young man in the midwest had video taped that cloud w! ith hebr ew writing in it. So, guess I&#39;m not the only one who saw both things. I was working at this business place from 1976 to 1986. By 1985, the cat in this note had disappeared and I had acquired other cats. I have vet. papers for all my cats but have never looked up ones for the cat of note to pinpoint date closer. I know it was July 25th for sure because I noted it was my sister&#39;s birthday. Lastly, the object was not chevron shape nor triangle so I said other because it looked exactely like an arrow head, with the notch in bottom center.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

I literally saw all the neighbors pointing in the sky saying,&#34;what the hell is that.&#34; My father had seen it on 3 seperate occasions but he does not like to talk about it.

I did&#39;nt feel threatened by it,but the size of it overwhelmed me and I drove off quickly for about another 1/4 mile and and again slowed down.As I looked back,it was still just sitting there,hovering.I was just very anxious(and scared) to get home in New Castle at this point to tell my folks what I had seen.I reported it the the H.C.sheriffs office,they took my name,phone# and was told they would check it out.I never heard back from them.I always rode home with a co-worker after that,I never witnessed it again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;ve always wondered what would have happened if I had stopped and got out of my car.I sometimes think I missed out on a once in a lifetime chance of being part of something &#39;special&#39;.In any case,I&#39;ve never seen or experienced anything remotely like it since.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date and time are approximate.<n>
7/15/84 23:00|Brighton|MI|Other|3:00 minutes|While walking at night, I saw an object with rod-like extensions and colored lights move directly across my path in front of me.|8/28/03|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/030/S30615.html|13|ndxe198407| ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n> <n><n> <n><n> While walking at night, I saw an object with rod-like extensions and colored lights move directly across my path in front of me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was walking down my small rural subdivision street in Brighton, Michigan with a neighbor at about 11:00 p.m. on a mid-summer night about nineteen years ago.  We were on our way to my house.  We were alone.  The weather was very calm and still.  There were no clouds in the sky.  I do not remember if wether or not the moon was up that night.  If it was up at that time, it was behind us and not very bright.  The night was very quiet, dark and filled with stars as there were no nearby city lights.  My neighbor was on my left side as we were walking down my subdivision street.  The street is straight and runs north (the direction we were walking)and south.  On the west side of the street is an open field and on the east side is thick woods with houses set back off the street about 150 feet into the woods.  While walking down this street (heading north), we both saw (at about the 10 o&#39;clock position) an object moving low in the sky over the open field.  It moved in a straight and horizontal path at a constant speed.  It was moving from the west to the east.  It&#39;s movement was exactly perpindicular to our path.  It did not rotate during our view of it.  It was approximately 50 yards from us as it passed over the street directly in front of us.  There was no sound at all!  There was no sound prior to seeing it, and no sound while we were witnessing it.  When it passed over the street it disappeared from our view as it moved just above the tree tops on the east side of the street.  From the time we first saw it to the time it disappeared from our view was about five or six seconds.  The body of the object was dark and generally round.  I could see the silhouette of it with the night sky behind it.  It&#39;s height was about the same as it&#39;s length.  It&#39;s body was about the size of four full moons as seen from our distance from it.  There were a lot of rod-like extensions protruding straight out of the body in all directions.  The extensions were also dark, just as the body of the object was.  The extensions varied a little in length, from about half the diameter of the body of the object to about the full diameter of the body.  I did not see a pattern to the extensions with regard to each one&#39;s length with respect to where it was protruding out of the body of the object.  However, the extensions appeared to be evenly spaced from each other where they protruded from the body.  From the one side of the object that was in view (because it did not rotate), I saw approximately twenty of these extensions evenly spaced around the entire body of the object.  At the very end of each extension was a single light.  The color of these lights were red, blue, green, yellow, and white.  None of the lights were blinking or changing colors or fading out.  All of the lights were steadily on.  When it disappeared from our view we stopped walking.  We stood there stared at where it disappeared over the tree tops in front of us and listened.  There was no noise and the air was still.  Then my neighbor said, &#34;What was that?&#34;  I said, &#34;I don&#39;t know.&#34;  We continued walking north towards my driveway.  We reached my driveway about two minutes later and turned to walk down it.  My driveway is straight and runs east off of the street with woods on both sides of it.  My house sits about 150 feet down the driveway on the south side.  The driveway continues past my house as a firetrail which deadends about 500 feet further back into the woods.  We had not taken ten steps yet on my driveway walking east when we saw the same object again.  It came into our view in front of us out of the north and was moving to the south.  It moved straight and perpindicular to our path just above the tree tops with a constant speed and horizontal movement, just as we saw it moving two minutes earlier.  The object passed in front of us at the same distance from us as before-about 50 yards.  Again, there was no sound at all.  The object disappeared from our view when it passed just above the tree tops on the south side of the driveway.  I immediate! ly felt as though this object was tracking us.  The speed at which the object was moving when we first saw it from the street did not allow for the time it took us to walk the rest of the distance to the driveway and see it again two minutes later in the same manner and at the same distance in front of us.  The disturbing feeling that we both felt as soon as we saw it the second time was that the object stopped and waited just out of our view from the street until we reached my driveway two minutes later.  That was about nineteen years ago and the two of us have not seen this object a third time.  I am reporting this today because of the recent reporting of the Howell Township, Michigan crop circles.  Howell is now my home town.  I read the local papers about these crop circles.  One article mentioned that there have been several hundred reportings of UFO sightings in the Howell and Brighton area dating from just this month to several decades ago.  I have never visited this web sight before today, but I felt that with all of these reportings in Livingston County, Michigan, I should report what I witnessed in case anyone that reads this may have seen what I saw nineteen years ago and would like to report their witnessing of this object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

I never had the money to stop at a motel along the way, so I usually drove straight through. A normal trip with the occasional rest-stops would take me about 28-32 hours. (LA to Dallas, via El Paso).<n> <n><n> <n><n> The time was approximately 2AM. We were in the desert in New Mexico, about two hours away from El Paso. The roads were clear, very little traffic except the occasional 18 wheeler. Running parallel with the highway is a rail-line. But, it is at least 5 miles in the distance.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The girls were asleep in the back seat. I promised them if they rested, we would stop in El Paso at our favorite Denny’s and have breakfast.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had the window down, it was summer and the desert air was finally cool. I was very tired. My legs felt like lead, my hands were bruised from holding the steering wheel; and my eyes burned from lack of sleep.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I heard a whirring noise that I thought must be a helicopter or a small aircraft. The only difference was the noise was more of a soft hum than that of a gas fueled engine.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I glanced out the window and saw this object sort of hovering above my car, just a few feet above us. There was a row of lights along its cylindrical side. They were soft, blinking lights; twinkling more than blinking; nothing garish about them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I stared up at the object, it took off at an angle that no other aircraft I had ever seen could have done. It went on its side about half-way over and then with a soft” whoosh”, it was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I shook my head and drove on and suddenly realized the aircraft was back, this time on the other side of the car. I leaned over and looked at it and it made the same noise and instantly was on my side of the car again. The aircraft followed my car, playing with me, dashing from one side of the car to the other; hovering in front of me, and following along behind, for about 20 miles.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When they took off, I heard the soft whoosh and watched as they disappeared in the beautiful night sky. I felt such a sadness that they were gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> But, the strangest thing had happened. The girls were awake, and we were all completely refreshed as if we had been asleep for nine or ten hours. My legs were no longer tired, my eyes didn’t burn, and the girls were wide awake and jovial. We laughed the rest of the way to El Paso.<n> <n><n> <n><n> While we were freshening up in the restroom at Denny’s, my youngest daughter said to me, “Mommy, those were angels driving that air car. They knew you were going to have an accident if they didn’t help you.” I asked her how she knew that and she just smiled and shrugged.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After that, whenever I tried to talk about it, neither of the girls remembered the incident at all. I remember it as clearly as if it happened yesterday. I wish I could have thanked them.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

This is something I kept to myself. Anyway, I was about 14 years old and there is a play park next to my mother&#39;s house. I would always look out of the window and look at the stars before I went to bed. This one particular night I looked out of the window and saw a circular object with a yellowish light going around it. I swear it just took off from somewhere because it was headed toward the sky. I observed it for about 5 minutes and it disappeared right before my eyes. There is an airport not too far from where I lived but I saw this very clearly. It was a clear night with a full moon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Time and date are approximate.  One of three reports from same source.  PD))<n>
7/10/84 22:30|New Pine Creek|CA|Light|1 hour + ???|White light moving W to E  to Big Dipper. Hung there until it disappeared|3/19/09|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/069/S69099.html|16|ndxe198407| White light moving W to E  to Big Dipper. Hung there until it disappeared<n> <n><n> <n><n> My location was behind (directly south of) the old sheds and farm house located at the east end of State Line Road in New Pine Creek, CA (on the Oregon/California border).  My sleeping bag and pad were on the ground with my head at the SE and my feet pointed toward the NW.  Far off to my left, at a point near WNW, I saw a “white light” moving in a straight line across the sky (toward ENE.)  Because the “white light” was moving, I decided it must be an airplane.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first, because the “white light” was moving at what I call a slower than normal airplane speed, I thought it was a small, private plane -- yet there were no blinking red/green lights.  Due to the lack of blinking lights, I decided it was a much larger airplane and must be flying at approximately 30,000 feet or higher, and I probably would not see blinking lights from that distance.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I presumed the “plane” had have taken off from Portland or Eugene, OR and was heading for Boise, ID, or Salt Lake City, UT – and might have been ahead of schedule.  Therefore, the pilot was flying at less than normal speed so as not to arrive too early at the terminal.  I continued to watch the light for approximately 35-45 minutes (or longer) as it continued to move in a straight line across the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When the “white light” reached the middle of the “cup” of the Big Dipper, it stopped moving; it just hung there!  Puzzled, I continued to watch it very carefully expecting to see some movement that would explain why I had thought the “white light” (airplane) was staying in one place.  Yet it did not appear to move.  Again, it just seemed to be hanging there.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I continued to watch the light for at least another 20-25 minutes as the “white light” remained in the same place.  Then, suddenly I realized, whereas the “white light” was still in the same spot – it was getting smaller and smaller!  I watched the light for many more minutes – until it disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In thinking carefully about what I had just observed, for that “white light” to have covered the distance to the area of the Big Dipper – he was really moving!  Then, at the place we call the “cup of the Big Dipper,” where the light made a 90-degree turn to its left and moved away from Earth until it could no longer be seen -- again, to me, that meant he was really moving!  Until, and unless, proved otherwise, I firmly believe the “light” was not an airplane, but must have been a UFO “way, way out there.”<n>

It was 3-4 am on a crystal clear california summer night. There were many bright stars in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My friend and I were facing the mountains behind lake Skinner and were looking at the stars in the sky. We both saw a bright blue glowing orb come out of space moving very very rapidly i thought it was a shooting star at first.  It came out of space from the size of a pinprick to a larger size made a 90 degree turn over the mountains shot accross 10-20 miles of mountains in a second then made another 90 dergee turn and shot back out into space and dissapeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There is no airplane that i know of that can move that fast, shooting stars and comets don&#39;t make right angle turns. I never believed on UFOs or any of that stuff until i saw what i saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My friend was disturbed about the sighting and after a short disscussion confirming that we both saw the same thing he refused to ever talk about it again. The other person that was there never saw it since it all happened very very quickly.<n>
7/10/84 03:30|Blairstown|MO|Light|30 min.|Round neon light blue ball passing east to west across the sky.|2/18/01|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/016/S16212.html|18|ndxe198407| Round neon light blue ball passing east to west across the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I awoke at approx. 3am as a horse I was preparing to show the next day was very worked up about something out in our yard.  This was fairly unusual behavior for this particular horse so I went out to try and calm her.  I was able to catch her and calm her some and proceeded to sit nearby talking to her to sooth her while watching a round neon light blue ball moving very slowly towards our general direction.  It was impossible to tell the size of the object or the distance from my location as it was a cloudless night in a flat area. I remember not being frightened and having the impression it was quite far away. The  light slowly proceeded in a slight arc from east to west (still appearing to be getting closer but quite distant) for about 30 minutes as I watched.  Finally it disappeared behind a single tree.  I waited for quite some time for it to reappear on the other side, but it did not.  I am now an aircraft specialist stationed at a military base with substantial air activity and would guess that the light was at approximately 3000&#39; agl.  It was not an airplane.<n>

It was 11:00 p.m. and I was heading north.  I was looking at the stars and saw the Big Dipper and saw a ‘star’ go horizontally across the middle of the dipper.  When it got to the middle, it visually looked like it began flying straight down and I thought to myself planes do not make 45 degree turns.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then I realized the ‘star’ was getting larger and coming toward my car very fast and was not going down but coming towards me.  Then it was above my car outside my driver’s side, up quite a ways. This all happened extremely fast.  It followed my car for a few minutes and I was able to tell that it looked as big as a football field in the sky, with some lights around the edge of its kind of oval shape.  I had my window down and it made no sound at all.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My little dog was in the back of the car and my camera was there, but I was too afraid to stop the car and get it to take pictures.  I watched it and in just a few minutes, it flew away so fast, I could not believe how fast it took off, going south, and then it was gone from sight.  I went home and told my mom and she said she believed me and had heard similar stories from other people in the area.  I did not report it because in 1984, most people did not believe you, so I just kept quiet except for telling my sisters.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

We heard nothing. Our friend, who was in the back seat said &#34;there it is&#34; and pointed above the trees that bordered the pasture about 100 yards off the side of the road. Above the trees,at about 100 ft. from the ground an elongated black triangle with a light at each corner floated noiselessly.One light was green, one red,and one was yellow. The red light was shining down into the trees and moved as if looking for something below. We observed this for about 2 minutes and decided that we did not want to be whatever it was looking for so we left. This was a clear, star filled sky. The aspect of this event that puzzled us as we discussed it on the way home was the speed of the object&#39;s descent and how it came to such an abrupt stop in mid-air. We dropped our friend at his residence and went to ours. My wife and I were pretty spooked and got no sleep that night. For some reason we never discussed this further; within three weeks we broke up, got a divorce, and have had no contact since. Our friend moved away during this time and I have not been able to find him through family or friends.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I looked up and saw lights in a a triangle shape not more than 200 feet overhead.  It moved VERY slowly and made NO noise.  My boyfriend was also with me at the time.  He is an amateur pilot but could not explain what the object was.  My first thought was that it was small planes flying in formation, but there was no deviation between lights and no movement...it seemed to be one huge object...about the size of 3 football fields.  Later, they said it was ultra-lights, (from Stormville) but nobody who saw this and other similar sightings agreed.  There were several sightings over the course of the year in  the Hudson River Valley.<n>
