6/30/09 23:59|Kingston (Canada)|ON|Unknown|50 seconds|Object appears as flash of light in south sky, turns into rotating red light above Kingston Ontario|8/5/09|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/070/S70840.html|1|ndxe200906| Object appears as flash of light in south sky, turns into rotating red light above Kingston Ontario<n> <n><n> <n><n> On the night of June 30th 2009 myself and my mate were walking our dogs at 12:00 midnight to 12:10. Always be interested in the sky and keeping an eye open this night was perfect, clear sky&#39;s the moon just partly lite in the south west sky, when I noticed a glint in the southern sky at about 10 o&#39;clock.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have seen lots of sat&#39;s give up there location to the setting sun glowing brightly and then going out. I watched this to see where it was going and how long it would last. It then got bigger and I figured I was looking at a plane headlight, but then it got longer so I asked my mate, what do you think of this light. She quickly looked up and we both watched as it got brighter and larger, looked like an hour glass to me how far off, no idea but it seemed a great distance, then after about 15 seconds it went out, just sort of a grey outline in the sky, so I thought wow that was some light show, it must be huge to look that bright down here and still seen as an outline (looked to me like a bus flying through space, from where I stood).<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then I noticed that there was a red light on the object. I thought, what in orbit would have a red light on it that I could see from here? Then I noticed the red light was moving. It traveled a circular pattern as it it was mounted on the outside and was going around something. The object could not be seen, it was as if it was invisible, but the red light gave it away, It took about 5 seconds for the light to do one revolution, I watched 3, 4 revolutions as the object was directly over head moving towards the North. No sound, nothing, just then I noticed, it was glowing on the top, I could not see the top but the air above it was lite up like the color of a sunset, pink, orange, red, I mentioned, look it&#39;s glowing at the back on top, just then a small orb came off of the larger object, this orb looked like an ember from a hot fire, about the size of a star, and just as bright. It made several loops behind the object (like an ember in the wind) , seemed to follow, but I watched the larger object due to the fact that if you took your eye away you could probably not locate it again, the object continued to the north with the light rotating.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The Red light was the red of a tail light in a car or a jet, how fast would it have to have been going to go from sunlight to over my head in 25 seconds, then to the north and back out of sight in another 35 seconds? The circular path the light took was very large, I would say that if you held out a 5 inch disk at arms length it&#39;s about the size of the light path when the object was overhead. The whole event lasted about 50 seconds or so. I have never seen anything like this and I am in my 45th year here on Earth. I will try to get my mate to submit what she saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Never stop looking up you never know what you&#39;ll see!<n>
6/30/09 23:35|Avnol (near)|CA|Triangle|10 - 15 seconds|LIGHT SPOTTED OVER INTERSTAE 5 CHANGED SHAPE AND COLOR|8/5/09|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/070/S70792.html|2|ndxe200906| LIGHT SPOTTED OVER INTERSTAE 5 CHANGED SHAPE AND COLOR<n> <n><n> <n><n> Tuesday June 30th at approximately 11.35pm, traveling south bound on the California interstate 5 near Avenol. My family and I were in our vehicle, I was driving my wife was in the passenger seat and my two teenage children were in the back.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About five minutes earlier we had seen a shooting star that was large and green in color, it stood out because of the brightness and size. I noticed off to my left on the east side of the interstate a similar green light, I watched it for 30 seconds thinking it was a tower light from a cell tower or power line. I did not take my eyes off of it except to check the road and traffic in front of us then return to looking at it. I then noticed it was moving west bound and starting to cross the interstate. My thought at the time was ‘could this be another shooting star?’ it was approximately 20 feet off the ground it appeared to be moving across the interstate at 25 miles per hour. The only thing I saw was a small green light going across the road, no outline of anything else.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At this point I pointed it out to my family who all watched it as well. I was very clearly studying this light and everything around it and saw no outline of anything. As it went over the interstate it went off to the right hand side my family turned to watch it clearly, it appeared to speed up and then all these lights appeared on it . It looked like an almost V shaped two lengths of straight white/ silver lights with  two or three square shaped lights below it. It looked almost triangular in shape. It continued to glow and then looked like it was flying lower slightly tilted which allowed us to see the square outline of lights below the two long strip of lights, then we only saw the glow of it which then disappeared completely.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The amazing thing was there was no sound at all, if it had been a jet or aircraft we would have heard the engines as it was so close to us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It lasted only ten to fifteen seconds from start to finish. The highway was busy so others must have seen this as well. We have never seen anything like this before. I am in my mid 40s my wife in her late 30s and my children 16 &amp; 17 years old.<n>

We were in a small subdivision. We looked up and saw three sets of lights one red one blue and one white in triangular shapes surrounded by smaller white lights in the shape of a circle. It appeared to be spinning at an angle and we could tell it was spinning because the lights were turning clockwise.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

I was driving down the road and looked up to see what looked like a moving star. I know it wasn&#39;t a shooting star because it moved much slower. It was going in the same direction that I was going. As i watched it move many miles ahead of me, it started heading for the ground.  It looked like it ended up on the ground somewhere. I tried to locate it but I realized that it could have been the next town over.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

6/30/09 21:30|Valley Center|CA|Oval|45 seconds|A UFO was spotted flying from the top of Palomar Mountain|8/5/09|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/070/S70785.html|5|ndxe200906| A UFO was spotted flying from the top of Palomar Mountain<n> <n><n> <n><n> We are on the Rincon Indian Reservation in Valley Center, CA. On top of Palomar Mountain I saw a light blinking at the peak.  My friend and I thought it was the local observatory but our local friend stated there was no observatory on top of that mountain.  As soon as he made the statement we looked at the light and it immediately took off.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The craft took almost straight off curving with the wind.  After floating to an altitude still under clouds it proceeded to travel towards the west.  We heard no noise coming from the craft, and we are well aware of the noises normal air crafts (i.e. helicopters, air planes, balloons, etc.) would make.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We continued to follow the craft through the sky and it appeared to be football shaped.  All lights on the craft were white, and the two that were on the sides were blinking simultaneously, unlike and air plane whose lights will blink one after another.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Soon after, the craft disappeared in the distance, but not necessarily out of the atmosphere.  Since the sighting now about an hour later, we have heard a helicopter flying around the area as well as some other lights, possibly vehicles, traveling to the top of the mountain.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We are more interested in what else it could be, seeing as how Camp Pendelton is so close, but this is unlike anything we have ever seen before.<n>
6/30/09 21:00|Clarksville|TN|Light|10 minutes|Saw lights towards  Hopkinsville, KY, there were about 10 of them|8/27/09|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/071/S71528.html|6|ndxe200906| Saw lights towards  Hopkinsville, KY, there were about 10 of them<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were standing outside and noticed something flash across the sky faster than a plane towards Hopkinsville, KY.  At first we all thought it was a shooting star, but noticed that it just stayed in one spot.  Other planes were flying close to it, but it just sort of stayed in one spot, then as soon as the planes would pass, it would start to move again.  The object went behind a neighbor&#39;s house slowly, so we all followed it to see what it was going to do.  It disappeared rather quickly. We went back to where we initially saw it and noticed that the &#34;stars&#34; that were in the sky all around it were gone as well. Later on one of the witnesses said that when her mother had come to visit earlier this year, she had seen the same sort of thing as well. Nobody believed her then, but now we all do.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Source of the report indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

The normally brown murky water was clear like the ocean in Hawaii.  The UFO had no water dripping off of it and there were no ripples in the pond.  I looked at the top of it and my eyes went black for 5 seconds.  When I could see again it was still there.  I ran inside to tell my mom and brother.

All of a sudden, we saw three lights in a triangular formation in the sky.  My father is military, and has showed me what different airplanes look like at night, so of course I tried to match these lights up to the lights of common airplanes.  Blanchard, Louisiana, is in the middle of nowhere in Northwestern Louisiana.  Just as I was trying to figure it out, the lights all moved at once to the right in the sky at an outrageous speed.  They zipped to the left and diagonally to the right again, all the while keeping in a triangular formation.  The lights were white and very bright; their light drowned out the light of the stars.  They were moving so fast it was hard to keep up with them.  No sound came from the lights at all. It was very quiet.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My friend and I watched in amazement and a little bit of terror as well.  It was so strange; we both had never seen anything like it in our lives.  The lights decided to zoom towards us; they seemed so close that I thought if I reached out I could touch them.  But before I could do that, the lights sped off into the distance and disappeared.  It was a truly amazing experience.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

The star looked very odd and I couldnt stop looking at it, all of a sudden the object started moving back and forth. Also the light was fading in and out. It was moving around like a feather up and down, left to right, where ever it wanted to fly it was flying. Then the light faded completly out and we saw a flash across the sky and it started swaying on the other side of the sky. It faded out again and then reappeared in the spot where we first saw it.  Then it was just staying still blending in like a star. Then the tree line that we were looking over at the object, had a green glow that it was giving off. The glow stopped shortly after it started and then the light object was just moving slightly but staying in the same area for another 45 mins. After about 45 min the clear sky that we were looking at instantly became cloudy and the light faded and we didnt see the object again. It was a very strange object and not like anything ive ever seen before it was a bright white light that faded and looked like a ring light at times. It is something i will never forget. I also would like to mention Avon is a very strange marshlands, with many stories. This could be one reason why this object was over Avon but i cant say for sure.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

In the picture that google took there is a very curios ufo in the sky.  There is a exhaust plume and a craft, the curios thing is that you can see an exhaust area where the ufo seemed to appear out of nowhere and then accelerate.  Anyone interested in seeing this should go to Google Maps, type in Lumpkin Road, Oroville, Ca.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Use the satellite view and go to the first bridge over the lake, then go to street level and point north and up.  It is VERY visible and very intriguing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC NOTE:  Witness indicates that date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))<n>

I first thought it could be a reflection from the camera, or drivers windshield who takes the images for Google; however, wherever you go in the street views nearby, the UFO is orientated correctly in the sky; even if it is behind you (you can rotate street view images all angles.)  To see for yourself one can use Google Earth, type in 8200 Alverstone Av. Los Angeles, CA. 90045 and pan up to the sky and see it. Then travel all streets near by via &#34;street view&#34; and locate the image yourself.  You will find that this appears to be a UFO that is travelling very, very slowly in the northerly direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

6/29/09 23:50|South Slocan (Canada)|BC|Disk|23:50- 0:05|Saucer like object seen at night.|8/5/09|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/070/S70776.html|22|ndxe200906| Saucer like object seen at night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was leaving my friends house at roughly 11:50 pm on Monday the 29th. I said good-bye and walked to my car. Right before I got to my car I saw a light pretty much right above me at a angle. I stopped to see what it was. At first all I saw were the lights. There were two or three dots of light. The colors were red and blue. I stared at the object for a few seconds and then I saw the shape of it. It was like a Frisbee shaped object that was right above me. It started to move from side to side. I could tell that this was not an airplane or a helicopter right away.  It was fairly large at that time right above me. I ran back to the house and got my friend. When he came out the object moved towards the mountains a little bit and looked further away but was still fairly large. It was approximately the size of a quarter, maybe a little bigger. We watched it move from side to side quickly. It moved very fast.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object then after a few minuets took off down the sky line at very fast speeds. It took a straight path down to the mountain line near his place. The object then stopped and proceeded to move in strange ways. It moved around the sky at high speeds that of which an aircraft could not do. My friend then ran back into the house to get his brother.  When his brother came out of the house the object moved around a bit more and slowly seemed to almost fade away, like turning invisible.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This object when it was over me made no sounds at all. It made no sounds when it moved around. I know what satellites, airplanes, helicopters and shooting stars look like and this was neither of them. When the object was over me I could make out the figure of the object, and what the bottom portion of it looked like. It was metal and had an odd shaped bottom. What we saw the other night was unlike anything I have ever seen before. I didn’t really believe in UFO’S etc but after seeing that I don’t know anymore. All I know was that it was something strange. We watched the sky for about 30 minuets after the object had disappeared but saw nothing else. What this object did was physically impossible for any other aircraft to do. We think that this is either a top secret aircraft of some sort, or something else we might not have been meant to see. There are no military bases or anything near us for probably hundreds of kilometers. Nothing else can explain what this was. I feel crazy to have even seen something like this and I’m sure no one will really believe this but I thought I might at least write somebody to just report what the three of us saw and hope to get an answer back.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I turned north to face it, it was high up but it&#39;s shape was clearly visable as it was heading south-southeast it moved slowly and pitched from side to side. I knew at this point that it was not an aircraft. There was no noise coming from the sky, it was shaped like a triangle with a slowly dimming red/white light emanating from the center. The light would at times, look like a dimming campfire. As it moved slowly across the sky, I called my mother outside and as soon as I looked back up we saw that this craft was being &#34;followed&#34; by an aircraft (military) which we could now hear. It seemed to be following this object from underneath because the object looked so high up. Then the object stopped and hovered for a second and it dropped a reddish white fireball toward the ground, after it fell the craft picked up speed, I guess it noticed it was being followed at this point. It moved faster toward the south, then dropped another fireball. We watched this fireball drop somewhere in the distance, it seemed to burn out before it hit the ground. After this last drop it disappeared rather quickly going eastward, maybe toward sonoma/napa area?. Then the aircraft/jet took off southeast.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides little contact information.  PD))<n>

She said &#34;look mom a HUGE falling star&#34;  I looked out and told her to stop and we got out to watch it. I remember thinking that &#34;holy cow thats a huge meteor&#34;, and told the girls if it hits we are going to feel it. At that point it leveled off and slowed way down following a straight line directly south, actually slowing and hovering at times. The light seemed to fade and come back to very bright and after awhile it literally disappeared. Feeling like we had just witnessed something pretty strange we went on home.  The girls took off to go to a friends house and the called me and said &#34;its back!!!!&#34; I went to the front yard and there it was hovering over the southern end of town. It disappeared once more and we didn&#39;t see it again.  Needless to say, I didn&#39;t get much sleep.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I then opened the 2 windows in front of  this couch to let in the cool air from the storm.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I knelt there, watching the storm through the screen, my eye caught a flash of color in all this dark greyness. The palms were being whipped by the ,at times,40 to 50 mph wind and the other trees branches were swaying so anything not tied down would have been whisked away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Angle of  Observation In  the front of  the house is a large tree at the bottom of the driveway. The house rises at a 30 degree angle up from the road and base of the tree.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Looking out through a gap in this tree was,. what I thought,.. a plane on fire surely hit by lightning during this storm.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is key now, my reasoning being there is nothing but big open sky beyond this tree at the altitude of my line of sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is upwards almost another 30 degree angle at  most. This bright fiery thing was not very high up but lower than the glider people that fly over our  house during tourist season.. I could not tell how far away this was from my house as I  have nothing to use as a gauge.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In this area you have to go downtown, ten miles, to see anything tall only 2 buildings.that are impossible to see from here.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I watched,  this orangey red pulsating thing, our fire house sirens went off,.. so it was a plane then ? However, this thing never fell but hovered in the same spot so that it was now past 6 minutes according to my watch.<n> <n><n> <n><n> If it was a plane it would not continue to hover in the same place.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What troubled me a lot was, it suddenly flashed an extremely bright red around the edges..,twice,.. as if it were winking at me and my hair stood on end and I got the weirdest sensation, it knew I was watching it.  Crazy feeling.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I then ran to get my little camcorder but fumbling I only got the lightning flashes and my cursing that I missed it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Result I never had a good enough look to see the whole shape of it. Going outside was a definite danger.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It  did scare me so I at one point I closed the curtains. This all lasted  9 minutes. The lights came back on the storm waned and when I looked out it was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I wonder if anyone else saw anything that night.<n>

After a few minutes, I saw, what I thought was a high flying plane or bird. I was amusing myself watching it go in and out of the clouds. Sometimes it never left the cloud it was in, which is what really made me pay attention.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was flying up and down and forward, never backward. I tried to capture the image on my camera but there was bright sunlight and it was causing too much of a glare.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A short time later, a plane was behind it.. almost following. A regular craft. There was a marked difference in the way this one was flying in comparison to the first one. That&#39;s what made me think this was a UFO....then they both disappeared. I found this odd because we aren&#39;t that far from Newark Airport in NJ<n>

I was probably the fifth or sixth car in line. The light had just turned red so when I came to a stop, I just started gazing at the surroundings.  I noticed what I thought to be a plane north of where I was heading.  At first, I was intrigued at how shiny this &#34;plane&#34; was.  It was so chrome that it was reflecting.  As I sat there staring at it, I noticed that there was no rear stabilizer.  Just a chrome cigar, sitting there.  I turned to see if traffic had started to move and it hadn&#39;t, so I turned back to the object and it was gone.  Just like that!  I looked all around to see if I could spot it but there was no sight of it what so ever anywhere.  I kept searching, hoping to find but the person behind me started blowing their horn because traffic started moving again.  That&#39;s when I thought to myself if I was seeing a UFO, so I came home and found this website to see if anybody may have posted something so I wouldn&#39;t think I was nuts.  Sure enough, there is a posting on the second of June of a sighting in Canton, GA around the same time, although that is described as oval.  this may have been, I don&#39;t know.  What I do know is that is was long, very shiny and if I had to scale it, I would say that it was roughly about an inch and a quarter, maybe and inch and a half in length from where I was sitting.  Amazing.  I will try to retrace my steps around the same time tomorrow and see what happens.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

They were in a tight flight formation before doing a loop and then climbed out of sight.  The craft displayed aerobatic style flight characteristics ( like that of a blue Angle show)    Before disappearing into thin air , the sun reflected of the surface of the craft then they vanished. At first I thought they were birds until I noticed the sun reflecting off the top surface of the craft . All three flew in perfect unison and at those altitudes It would be rather hard to see birds flying.  Not to mention they were about 20 miles away from were I was standing.  I could see no vapor trails leaving the craft.<n>

Most retreated after about 3 or so minutes but about 5 remained and in a few minutes vanished. They were located in the direction of Scottsdale, AZ.

The light remained in this position until it disappeared at 5:15. Light consisted of multiple lights in 3 rows, with 10-12 lights in a row in a bar like shape. Lights varied between being on and off, in color, intensity. They varied from glowing to being beams of light extending 5 times the width of the object. The lights seemed to rotate at times and sit still at other times, and sometimes flash at random. A red beam was often seen shining from the bottom of the object. 6-10 audible tones were heard while the object was visible. Tones were heard about every 15 minutes and lasted only a few seconds. The object seemed to move slightly in reference to nearby stars every few minutes but still remained in nearly the same place. A low hum was maintained at all times during the sighting but this could possibly have been local road noise.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Star or planet, we suspect.  PD))<n>

They were quite clearly not planes,and certainly were not any weather phenomena,astronomical phenomena,they were quite simply ufos. They reminded me of the phoenix lights, an exceptional display of activity that defies traditional explanation.  I have seen a ufo before,on more than one occassion,so i know exactly what i,my son,and my wife saw.I have reported it to the aviation authority(at approximately 12.15 am,and i was their third call reporting this phenomena).Kindly contact me if required.<n>

Not a star. Not the moon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Today is June 28, 2009 at 10:20 pm. I live in Dallas, TX, near the Turtle Creek area, just north of downtown. I was driving home from a friend’s house about 10 - 15 minutes ago, going southwest on Turtle Creek Blvd. when I rounded a curve and up in the sky directly ahead was a huge lighted object, round, with colored lights. It had a large wedge of red and a large wedge of white light. It was bigger than the full moon, and stationary. The sky is dark. The moon is a bright crescent tonight -- it’s off to the north east, as I can see it clearly in the sky. I saw the object only a matter of seconds, as when I went under the trees and around another bend, it was gone when I came around again. This is the second time I’ve seen such an object in this area. The other time was several months ago, when I saw the same thing -- round object, large, with red and white lights. It was hovering over the boulevard and lasted for 45 minutes or so. I saw it as I was driving, and then parked and went up into my apartment on 12th floor. I watched it from my balcony. I am convinced what I saw was not a plane, nor was it the moon or a star. These sightings are upsetting.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I had the impression that the setting sun provided the gold color that made them visible to me.  I saw them clearly for a few seconds from the front of my house.  I moved quickly through the house and asked my wife to come and see them.  By the time that I went thriough the house they were gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

On a cruise ship departed from Miami Fl, off the coast of Puerto Rico. My wife and I had returned to our balcony stateroom.  I stepped out onto the balcony just to have a look at the ocean and see if there were any other ships around. I did not see any other ships. What I did see were three red lights in the shape of a triangle,one light above 2 below, possibly 1-2 miles away, in the sky, probably 15 to 20 degrees above the horizon. The sky was clear with scattered clouds. At first I thought these three red lights were some sort of helicopter formation.I am an Air Force veteran, I quickly dismissed the helicopter formation as these light were, infact, perfectly stationary. They made no movement and there was no sound coming from them. I assumed that I was too far from the object to hear any sound anyway.I looked at the lights for maybe 5 to 10 seconds, watching for any movement and could not detect any. Next, I turned a! way from the object and looked around the sky , deliberately trying not to view the object. I once again found the object, still in the same location, unmoving. It was at that point that I called for my wife to come see this object. My wife had been occupied with doing something else and by the time she got to the balcony the lights just disappeared as I watched them.Just as though someone turned off a switch, as though turning off a light in a room. Gone! I have no understanding of how or where these lights came from. I can only say that they were real, not some transparent reflection of a common item which I mistook as something unexplanable. My immediate impression was of a helicopter or some sort of military aircraft, which I dismissed. Then I thought it might be some sort of marine navigation device such as a channel marker, which I also dismissed.I then began to get the feeling that these lights were &#34;watching&#34; us as I was watching them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date is approximate.

I glanced throughout the sky but could not see the object any longer.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I took a quick look out the window but didn&#39;t notice anything and soon returned to the comforts of my bed. Approximately 45 minutes to an hour later my dog jumped off the bed and ran to the front window. He started whining and running back and forth looking out all the windows from the first floor of the house. Since it obviously seemed something was bothering him outside, I got up again and looked out the back window. But this time I was startled to see a very strange large glowing Red Orb in the NorthWestern night sky gliding towards the East and seemingly descending into the woods behind my house.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I will try to describe the scene and this object as best I can, so you can hopefully picture and possibly help me in figuring out what this object might have been.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Looking North from my first floor rear window and Approximate 300 yards away there is a large tract of woods intertwined with a large creek and a field about 40 acres in size-including the woods it&#39;s  about 200 acres of undeveloped land.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I first saw the object in the NorthWest sky(500-800 feet high)on a slow Easterly downward trajectory. The object had what I can only describe as a Reddish glowing Orb(half the brightness and size of the full moon)on top of a structure that you could clearly see was being illuminated underneath it. The structure looked to be cylindrical or rectangle in shape and was vertically suspended under this glowing orb. The size I would estimate was 20 feet long(up and down)and 8 feet wide(left to right).<n> <n><n> <n><n> At this point the object was about 400-600 feet in the air and descending into the woods. Because of this I knew I wouldn&#39;t have much time to watch the object since it was descending in altitude. At this point I knew I had to make a decision and if I should try to grab my video camera. I knew it was a risk but I made the decision to grab the camera to document the sighting. I ran from the back window grabbed the camera and yelled for my wife to wake up and look out the back window(hopefully so she too could witness the event). I quickly grabbed the camera and returned to the window but was just briefly able to see it again as it descended deep into the woods. My wife made it to the window but unfortunately just seconds late.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Please note-being around aviation for the most part off my life I can definitively say this object was definitely not a airplane or a helicopter of any kind. The only possibility that I have to consider and can&#39;t be 100% certain about is that this was some kind of unknown military drone-I don&#39;t feel this would be a very good possibility though. The light I&#39;ve tried to describe on top wasn&#39;t your conventional light and certainly not a beacon light of any kind-It was more of a bright soft red glow, quite strange actually.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I spoke with Mr. Davenport at NUFORC and will closely follow his instructions on documenting this sighting. He suggested I contact The FAA, News Broadcasting Centers, Law Enforcement and anyone else who will listen. His instruction also entailed trying to locate the site where this object possibly landed. I will of course follow all of these additional details and therefore will keep you updated when any new details arise.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I Thank You for giving me this forum to post this unexplained event and again will keep you posted of anything I uncover.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thank You<n>

From the ground they appeared ovular in shape and were app. 5 meters apart. Again it’s very difficult to judge this distance from the ground. This was my first such experience and I just felt that I had to tell someone. The lights simply went by at a very fast clip and disappeared into the tree line.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I’m not sure but I have never seen anything like it in my life. I thought for sure they were like satellites but they are moving around too fast and they do kind of look like they are dancing around if that makes any sense?? I know it sounds ridiculous but thought maybe someone might know whether or not we are just being crazy thinking that a couple satellites dancing around the sky are something more than that.  Just kind of the coolest thing we have ever seen but sort of freaking us out at the same time.  Just wondering if there was some kind of super camera that could scope in and see if they are satellites or something else?? Really don’t have anything else to say so sorry not very descriptive but feel like we might sound a little crazy. Not sure if this is the format you need, but I tried.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

They were round like an upside down bowl hovering low over Staufen in Germany. When I first saw them I thought they were very bright stars then I realised how orange-red they looked. I looked for other stars in the sky but there were only a few visible and they were small and bleu. I watched them moving around   I went inside for my camera to try to film them. The only camera I have is digital the zoom was not strong enough, but I filmed 2 of the objects. I went upstairs to get a higher view. By this time just 1 object was left in the sky and appeared further away. They glowed and looked like they were spinning, they were quite low down.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

After having our barbeque we sat and chilled talking for around 2 hours. At around quater to 11 at night, one of the adults said &#39; whats that bright light over in the sky. I couldnt see and ran around the table to see it, when i looked through the gap of two houses i noticed a ditant light that was pretty bright. It quickly moved from quite low to really high. Probably the maximum height you would see an aircraft. At first we all though it was a helecopter, but having watched UFO files and other programs i was sceptical. The bright orange glow dimmed and it looked like it was travelling towards us this was about 10 seconds in from we first saw it. It quickly changed direction and started travelling away from us, at this point it was very high in the sky. But i said to my mother that how could it be a helecopter as it was going away and the lights were still facing us and it was a constant glow, also it was way to high for a helecopter. Shortly after moving away it slowly started to fade and completely vanished.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After woundering what it was you could tell the adults knew that this was no ordinary craft, however we didnt rule this out. At about 11 we all noticed the same bright light in the sky again at exactly the same place. It was high, had an orange glow, wasnt making any noise at all, and was hovering in the same spot. I ran upstairs to get my binoculars andmy dad fetched the camera, as i got back the light started to fade and we didnt have time to photograph. However a week previous to our sighting our next door neighbours had told my mum and dad that whilst in their back garden late at night, they to had seen a orange glow move extremely fast in the distance and slowly fade then see it around 5 minuits later once again. They recorded a video on their phone but once i had seen it i wasnt convinced. However after seing the object myself i am a strong believer and fullly believe them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Having seen this i really want to see this again and capture it myself as my words allown cannot fully describe exactly what it was like. Iff i do manage to capture it i would love to look more deeply into it to try and see what it looks like upclose.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The sky was still quite blue, and the moon was very bright.  I had just gone out to my car at the front of the house, and I stopped to admire the evening sky over the river thames. There is a small open park in between my house and the river, and a lot of open sky without any obstruction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I immediately noticed a very bright flame in the sky, right above the park and not more than a mile high from the ground.  It was definitely not something that I had ever seen before, and it was obvious to me that it was something out of the ordinary.  At first, I was just watching it, wondering what it could be, and trying to make sense of it.  The more I watched, the less I could explain it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I went quickly to the park and also to the other end of the street to see if anyone was around to witness it with me, but there was nobody.  I hadn&#39;t really taken my eyes off it all the time.  I then took a photo of it, as it was raising further and further upwards and to the left, with my phone camera.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I then knocked on my neighbours door, and before she answered, I noticed the flame had gone out and there was a grey object left, floating up and away to the left. My neighbour came out, and she looked up and saw it.  She said to me that it looked like it could be a UFO.  I said I had taken a photo of it, and I would put it onto my computer and see what it looked like once I could zoom in.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I put it onto the computer later that night, and after zooming in on the object, I have no doubt it was a UFO I saw.  The object has an obvious shape around the flame, as though the flame was in the centre of the craft, and the craft looks like it is metallic and has definite angles.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The next day, my neighbours husband said he heard someone in a local shop saying that they had seen something in the sky and they thought it was a plane crash.  I dont know if they were talking about the same thing I saw, but what I saw and photographed was definitely too bright and stayed too long for nobody else to have seen it.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The craft was unlike an airplane because it had three lights which if you connected with a line would make a triangle.  In addition they were not blinking lights.  It’s hard to say whether the lights were from a single craft or three separate ones.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Other members of my family dismissed it as an airplane or helicopter, but I don’t think one would fly right into the fireworks.  Perhaps, I am wrong and the aircraft was very far away and merely looked like it was in the fireworks but that still does not explain its unusual appearance and its abrupt disappearance.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I don’t know if anyone else saw it, but someone else should have because there were tons and I mean tons of people out on the waterfront on both the Philly and Camden sides.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It is presently summertime and the sun goes down later on; so either it was the remaining illumination from the sunset or the illumination from Los Angeles; either way, this was a dark object with no lights, however there was still enough light in the nighttime sky to see this object, and I know that I did see something.  It was possibly circular in shape, however it traveled too fast and it appeared too dark to tell.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The first time I saw this dark object (UFO), it curved in movement in the sky and then froze and went out of sight, and I shrugged it off as nothing at first.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The second time, however, I see another similar dark object (or possibly the same one as the first time), and this time it flew across the sky and out of sight in about a second... which is when I feel stunned and realize that this was definitely something.<n> <n><n> <n><n> No meteor or shooting star could ever curve and totally stop in the middle of the sky and disappear like that.... and no firework can ever travel miles and miles across the sky in less a second either, and neither a firework nor a meteor would appear totally dark as well, unless both are burned out or something.<n>

Interestingly was it seemed to have a well-defined start and end from a direction of WSW to ENE or a heading of 60 degrees from north.  A very small of indistinguishable shape object in the front seemed to be the source of the smokey emission.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After the passing of a minute or so, the apparent emitting object was a visual one-inch at 20-inch arm’s length ahead of the trail. The trail appeared to be 4” long.  To observe better, we drove under a cross-country power line to give us good visual reference at distance to observe two more features, one of which was the trail and the object appeared not to move for about 2 minutes and contact was lost with the object either as darkness was approaching or just too small to see.  The trail after 5 minutes of observation seemed to begin to break up.  Its total length never appeared to be greater than 4 inches at the 20 inch arm length.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The color of the trail was much darker than a jet would have been.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My explaination.  The dispersion of the trail gave the appearance of something at altitudes between 5,000 and 50,000 feet running an internal combustion engine with piston that had just broken an oil ring or an oil leak in an engine causing a black smoke to come from the engine until the engine exhausted all its oil and locked up or shut down.  Though the sun had just set, the sky was well bright enough to distinguish this event from a standard jet trail by virtue of the darkness of the apparent smoke.  The other unique feature was the sudden start of the trail and the sudden end to the trail and the extremely small object continuing with a 060 heading after the smoke trail finished.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Observer: Twin instrument pilot 2,000 hours BS Physics Engineer 85 employees 64 years old First UFO sighting<n>

She has been telling me of these strange lights that get real bright and and then dissapear very fast. I have been an Aircaft Mechanic sinse I joined the Air Force in 1980. Needless to say I have seen just about every man made aircraft ever made. So over the past few years I have explaining to her what a satelite looks like, pointed out the space station, space shuttle, and all manner of aircraft movement. She kept saying yea but this is different.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Well, I finally seen it for myself last night and yes this is something completely different. We live on the edge of the metropolis in far East Mesa right next to the GM proving grounds. A bright white light like a low orbit salletite that moved from north to south that suddenly lit up to perhaps 20X brighter &amp; larger. At this point the object shot directly into outer space and extremly high speed. Not speed of light speed but very very fast. No sound and only white light. I know of nothing that can move like that, very bizarre. The whole event lastest less than 10-15 seconds, with my wife sreaming; there that is what I have been seeing. Well I have no explanation but it did appear to move like a vechicle of some sort. A UFO until someone could explain what we are seeing.<n>

I was about 1000 feet above my back yard. It was like a light I had never seen before. As it passed overhead, my friend and I both had a feeling it was about to disappear. Suddenly it began to fade away in clear sight. After it was &#34;gone&#34; my friend and I talked about what we saw. We both saw some kind of metallic panel like lines, as if there was a structure within the light as the light faded away above us.

This time I was far from home and there was no way to explain away what I saw and when I blew up what I caught on camera, I definitely thought I recognized the shape from UFO documentaries.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A friend and I were on a road trip in CA heading North on the 5 Freeway in the Fresno and Merced counties area.  At the beginning of sunset we both noticed four distinct very bright objects in the sky that seemed to be reflecting the sun&#39;s light.  From where we were they looked like grains of rice or possibly disks, they were angled diagonally but one seemed to be more circular (probably due to the angle we were looking from).  The objects were completely stationary for the entire time that we saw them- NO trajectory or flight path, NO smoke or trail- completely stationary for at least 4 or 5 minutes until stratus clouds rolled in and the sun went down.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So far I have contacted two personal friends: one a military physicist and the other a formal naval airman- with both my story and photos.  The response I got from the airman was &#34;that looks like what I saw&#34;, the response from the physicist was &#34;stationary for at least 5 minutes?&#34;   I am posting this to see if anyone else encountered this…<n>

Using my binoculars, it appeared to be elongated with a glow. My neighbors also spotted it and nobody could figure out what it was. It seemed to have contrast like two colors to it? It could have been space junk or satellite or even the space station but I wouldn&#39;t think you could spot any of those things in mid day.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I live in Maple Valley and it was approximately North/Northeast between 25-45 degrees in the sky. Perfect viewing conditions, no clouds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;m just wondering what it could be. Thank you for your time.<n>

It&#39;s odd it&#39;s happing every day, last week there was a huge at least 1000 plus foot object got very bright floating very high I would say 35,000 feet or higher, there are  no comercial flights that use these flight paths because of retstricted air space around the military base, same thing it got super bright just floats along and vanished. These objects just show up and the bright like atracts my attention. planes fly in straight lines and usualy cause some what of vapor trail these float, change directions then vanish! I could blame in the Sun, but not when the sun is at a different angle for it create something that bright, but what vanishes it thin air, I look all around to see if it re apears, there nothing!  the average time is 1-3 minutes! Don&#39;t know what they are but it&#39;s very strange!!<n>

My first thought was that it was a jet from Wright-Patt, which was only a few miles away. When I first saw them, the lights were pretty much in a straight line, and probably twice tree top height. As I continued, it became apparent that I was looking at a &#34;triangle UFO)- one light at the front, and the other two on the sides. Having grown up in Dayton, I know that this had no colored wingtip lights. I could then see a slowly blinking red light on the bottom (it was dark and I could not make out the actual form.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I continued driving and rolled down my window to see if I could hear a jet engine- no, only wind and road noise. Looking up, when the red light came on, I could see the solid flat, dark surface of the area right behind the light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I rolled up my window and then caught a glimps of the craft in my rear view mirror. I could see two red lights on the back end. The craft was right over the median grass strip of the highway, moving East to West, very slowly. Size-wise, it would have been the size of one of the C-5A cargo jets that Wright-Patt has on base. No way this was one of those, which I&#39;ve seen for years and years, practicing touch and gos at the base.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;m neither shocked nor surprised- nice to have finally seen one of these, and I look forward to some type of &#34;disclousure&#34;<n>

I saw an egg/oval object, it was quite big so i knew it wasent an airplane of helicopter.  When the light of the object blinked the objecet seemed to moved very fast through the sky.  I have never seen anything move so quickly after a few seconds i couldnt see it anymore.<n>

I was very bright. The light was not moveing.  It started to lower down to the earth.  At that time I saw that it was a triangle shaped craft with circuler red lights around the edges of the crart.  When the craft got lower to the ground there is lots of trees and a house so i coulden&#39;t tell if it touched the ground or not.  It looked almost as if it went into someones backyard.  We watched and never saw if the craft left the area or not.<n>

I was going to the Shy Lounge in Levittown and on to Wantaugh parkway. I then it moved North and I lost trak of it. I was wondering if any body saw it.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

This light was very high and far away to the northeast.  Suddenly the light expanded to a very bright ball that must have been several miles across and looked like a miniature sun.  This only lasted about 10 seconds.  In the center of the light was the small lighted object which then headed east and up at a very high rate of speed and was gone from sight in 2-3 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Three professional people observed this object. No drugs or alcohol were involved.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

We could see it clearly through the left-back-seat-window, as it wasn&#39;t very high.  It was moving around quite fast, though smooth and steady enough for us to see that it was circular in shape, and had numerous blue lights on the bottom.  Furthermore it seemed to be of greyish/silverish color.  It was headed for the opposite direction, so we couldn&#39;t see it for long and make a video or even attempt to follow it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It is quite unbelievable to us that we may have seen a real UFO.  We have considered many &#34;normal&#34; explanations including: fancy spot lights, though if that were the case, we should have seen a beam of light under it, which we didn&#39;t; Likewise even a UFO remote control toy:  I have seen a remote control UFO toy, though I am sure it couldn&#39;t move around as fast, or over such a long distance in such straight strokes, besides be able to fly over buildings!  Plus it wouldn&#39;t be able to support the extra weight of the blue lights. We tried looking around on the net if anyone else had seen it, because there were many people in cars around, and some even on foot. Who knows maybe some security camera around there filmed it, hopefully!<n>

Another scout and I was looking up at the stars.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Suddenly, on the western part of the sky, we saw a round ball of light, flash across the sky, about the size of a gumball!  The scout asked me, &#34;Did you just see that shooting star?&#34;  I replied saying, &#34;That&#39;s not a shooting star, it was a lot bigger!&#34;<n> <n><n> <n><n> I know for sure it wasn&#39;t a comet because it lasted about a millisecond!<n>

I have seen identical objects over the last two years twice before.  It was not a flare from a satellite, because it was a steady glow which did not diminish.  I saw it make its way rather slowly at a steady speed and it disappeared in the clouds.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I was a private pilot fo 14 years and never saw any image such as we saw that evening when I did night flying.  The dual objects appeared to be at 35 degrees off horizon.  At first I thought it was one object, probably a plane but if that were the case it why did it have orange balls on its wing tips instead of the traditional green and red wing lighting?<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object was approaching us heading southbound and we were facing true north. Intially it appeared to be traveling at a high rate of speed, 4-5 miles from us.  I cannot estimate the altitude but I&#39;m guessing 3000-5000 feet.After 30 seconds of from first spotting, what I thought was one object turned out to be two.  One orange ball on our right started to lose altitude and converge toward the other orange glowing ball.  It  the turned sharply to our right away from the other ball and disappeared. Just prior to doing this it appeared to us that both orange objects appeared to stop in mid air.  About 10-15 seconds after the first disappearance, the remaining orange ball vanished.  I would say our entire viewing was 1-1/2 minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Upon returning to our home in about 5 minutes I called our local Salem Ohio police department and recounted this experience to them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((END ADDENDUM))<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke via telephone with this witness, and he sounded to us to be quite serious-minded and sincere.

We were driving a 4 door sedan so we could see all of the way around our vehicle without obstruction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We just passed mile marker 24. It was a very clear dark night not a cloud in the sky we could see for miles. There were off in the distance several antenna type (red lights) flashing sequentially, continuously in unison. We commented on the red lights and was wondering why so many antenna were in the area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> While traveling aprox 70 mph heading East bound we witnessed a flash of light to our right near the outside of our car. It seemed to be just above the height of the car off in the distance about 20 feet out from the car behind the Passenger head/shoulder area. Then another flash light a huge very bright quick LED about a foot back farther from the first. Then a third flash closer in time  but further in distance toward the rear of the car. (as if it were a old fashioned photo flash bulb.) Only very bright and much Larger.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We both looked at each other. I slowed the car. I said did you see that she said I saw the bright light flash 3 times but not at the same time as if it was in a delayed pattern. I agreed.  We decided to pull over on the side of the shoulder to see if we could see anything more.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I looked behind us and there was not a car in sight for miles but could see an overpass ahead. We pulled over to the shoulder on the right side of the road just past the overpass. We stopped the car and pulled to the side of the road but there was nothing. Just the next Mile marker, Mile 25.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We took off back onto the interstate. We were going about 50 miles hour increasing our speed when another bright flash occurred. Closer this time almost touching the car hood, in front middle.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The light floated to the passenger side of the vehicle almost as if it was hugging or surrounding the car. As before it was off the ground above the car approximately at the height  of the rear view mirror. The second blink was 2 seconds later,with a short surge of light was directly even with the car at the passenger window. The third flash again in a later 1 second delay pattern from the first. It was if something was flying like a very large Lightening Bug only with a very bright LED light flash about the size of a volleyball. After each flash it appeared to have  a diamond shaped light or a cross formation as it dimmed out.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We kept driving in disbelief as to what we just saw. We never did see an object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was a very bright Orb like LED lights in 3 sequential flashes but with a delay between the flashes. 2 separate times. Driving at that speed we were just dumb founded as to what it could be,especially after the second incident. It was in front of the car and we were traveling over 50 miles an hour but it seemed to mock our speed and hang in the air right with us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We never heard any noise or odd sounds. The other witness was sitting in the passenger front seat.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke via telephone with this witness, and she seemed to us to be quite sincere and sober-minded.

Well,so far I have seen these almost 2-3 times a week or more over the past year.Just happened upon this site so I wanted to make this documented because if anyone else sees this too I won&#39;t feel like I am going crazy!I have started to question my faith and looked into Bible/UFO/Historical findings.The objects look like stars,they are way up in the sky.I look at the stars alot and can notice these things alot.Most times they start in the west and go east,a couple times it has been south to North.The way I notice is,I am just standing outside having a smoke.Because I don&#39;t smoke indoors.I look at the sky and just stare at the stars,and then if you look around an really stare at them.It moves,it is slow.Sometimes they float like a feather,and then all of a sudden turn red like it is a falling star burning.Sometimes they just move and stay put.But not for long,just a couple minutes then they move into space and disappear.Sometimes there is more than one and they kinda play around with eachother,in a circular tag game style.They look like stars,even higher than the visable stars.Having no other appearance,just white glowing star like quality.No other lights flashing at all.And they are a mystery to me.But I know it is something.Must be ufo&#39;s??<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

The UFO appeared straight overhead.  The UFO moved across the sky at about two times the speed of a jet plane.  The UFO was a hexagon.  It was about 50 feet off the ground. It flew right over us.  I saw it on my front porch. My grandfather and I were sitting on the front porch talking and we heard a swishing sound.  I looked up and I told him to look.  We saw a thin hexagon two times the size of an airplane fly across the sky at an amazing pace.  It had flashing lights that changed colors.  The colors on it were unexplainable and I never saw them before.  Then it disappeared and we never saw it again.<n>
6/25/09 21:00|Pittsfield|ME|Other|4 hours|Bright dull lights over treeline.|8/5/09|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/070/S70782.html|79|ndxe200906| Bright dull lights over treeline<n> <n><n> <n><n> At approximately 11:00pm, in West Pittsfield I was letting my dog outside to go to the bathroom before I went to bed.  I noticed strange flashing lights on the horizon in the west, north and north western part of my tree line.  They were a dull yellow and lit up the whole tree line when they flashed. Almost reminiscent of what distant lightning looks like, however,  I should note that no thunderclap was ever heard after these flashes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was about a 10 second interval between the largest flashes and perhaps 3-5 seconds between the smaller ones. The flashing alternated in the following pattern: West, Northwest, North. I should also note that I have seen these flashes in the past.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In the summer of 2003, I noticed the same pattern of flashes in the same quadrants of my back field.  I alerted my father to this strange phenomenon. My father who is a doctor was also perplexed by these lights.  He at first dismissed them as distant lightning, and I implored him to stay longer and watch and observe that there was no thunderclap.  He stayed longer and agreed that it was strange that there was no thunder associated with these bright displays of lights, he also agreed that the timing was almost exactly 10 seconds between large bursts of light on the treeline.  I was fortunate enough to have my digital camera in which I took some low-grade videos of the event.  The video is not very good yet shows a decent example of what the lights looked like.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When the lights flashed, it was brightest on the western quadrant of my field.  It appeared as if the lights were flashing at a distance of perhaps 10-15 miles away.  When flashing occurred on the brightest of flashes (every 10 seconds) it was possible to see cloud formations above the light flash (an obvious indication of the brightness of the light).<n>

It was too low to be a plane but too high to be a remote control object.  It floated in one place for about 3-4 minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We went home and got a camera and it was floating in the same area.  It then started traveling north. We tracked along side it at approx 30 mph till it took a west turn. It again staid hovering and we were able to snap three pictures.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I took the pictures my camera did something strange and had an orbital glow in the lcd screen before the picture snapped.  It was also slow to respond.  This is not normal for the camera operation and I wasn&#39;t using a flash.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We followed around for a few minutes more as it tracked northwest across our neighborhood.  We tried to turn around and get a better spot to caputre video.  As we turned around it disappeared.  We drove a 1 mile square area looking for it but it was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The weather was perfect.  Very few clouds all which were high.<n>

This object was brighter than any star I have ever seen, and it stood in a local position for what I witnessed to be at least 4 hours.   The light was a steady light, with no pulsations, no flickering at all. The orb was a solid white incandescent light, unlike the surrounding stars which seemed dull, as they flickered seemingly different colors, reds, blues, orange, or green.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I eventually went to bed late at around 2 or 3 o&#39;clock in the morning.   I cannot say for exactly how long this object was in the sky, nor did I see it leave its location.   But I do know that it was no longer in the sky the next night, or the 2nd night after the event.   This event happened in a clear sky, with no cloud cover, and a small crescent moon.<n>

Far off in the distance I see something in the air flying, then there are sudden luminous bright white lights point towards my direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They were lit for just about 15 seconds then went out. I could still see the saucer slowly flying around in a circle. I ran to get my friend and it was the same cycle repeated.  She was a witness to the same event as well.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then the saucer just stayed in one place and disappeared.  It was kind of a roundish shape, no sound, no color, and just one.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was something i&#39;ve never seen before, very strange but I feel as if when you see a ufo, you know you&#39;ve seen one.<n>

The sky was dark and dotted with stars, planes slowly moved across the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I continued to watch the sky for a good thirty minutes or so until I saw something out of the ordinary in the sky.  What I saw was a sudden bright light; at first I thought it was just a bright star but the more I looked I realized it wasn’t a star at all.  The light was not a fiery white blaze a meteor would normally generate, it instead looked as though something was shining a huge bright spotlight in the sky towards my directing.  The flying object was not bearing any strobe light or light a plane would normally carry and not giving off any loud chopping noise a helicopter would generate and was not giving off a roar a jet would normally create.  The light it was giving was too bright and massive to be any airliner as well.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I strained my eyes to make out the light on the aircraft it suddenly turned to the left so I could get an almost clear view of its side.  With the light no longer focused in my direction I strained to view what appeared to be a long cylinder-like object with a red light on what I assumed was its front.  Soon the red light dimmed to such an extent that it was impossible to decipher where it exactly was in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I quickly ran back into my house grabbed my telescope and brought back outside where I set it up positioned it towards where I last saw the object in a desperate attempt to try to find it again, but to no avail, it was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  The report is somewhat reminiscent of a sighting of the bright &#34;flare&#34; from an Iridium satellite.

A good friend of mine and myself went out front of her house to smoke a cigarette. When we went outside we lit our cigarettes and above her house back and right a little bit there was what appeared to be one craft very low. It had lights that were revolving around it at a slanted angle like this &#34; / &#34; It crept very slowly across the sky until it was about at our location at her house.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As it was creeping past her house a little down the block it seemed it got to the point where the lights were flashing like every other light as opposed to the full circuit we were seeing. It started moving a little faster and it passed our location was a little ways out heading up and left from our location when it just straight split and started heading two seperate directions from which it was heading.<n> <n><n> <n><n> One began heading up towards the sky higher and ever further left where the other shot at a quick enough rate where we missed it for a moment then spotted it again one more time before it faded from view heading right from the direction it was heading. The part that had us was we started to hear loud sounds of a plane in the air after it was already passed us and all the sounds came from behind us until the passed as well. The delay was around 1 minute and 30 seconds behind the craft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We are firm believers that what we saw was not military of commercial but we are trying to get that information still.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

They were in one spot and the next time,would not be in a strait line,they would &#34;BOUNCE&#34;all over the sky! The Strobes,were like Flashes(VERY BRIGHT),and were all over the place! This sighting ,SURELY,was not a PLANE;the speed,and direction of flight was amazing. I called 911 to report it,and I doubt,very much,that no one else saw it. I sure would like to know!After,I called 911, I went back outside,and after,about 10 second,this,or there lights popped up again,headind back NORTHEAST until I coul not see them anymore.

I notice a small air plane was coming in that same direction when the UFO left.  After the plane that look as if it was circling.  As soon as the plane went out of view the the next UFO was in the same spot as the first one and it was a little closer this time, i could see that it was square with brite lights coming from it and in side the light i could see black columns like pillars on a old Rome building. I t was floating slow in same direction as the first one and did the same thing as far as color and speed then just like the first one is just faded into nothing and mabe 10 secs after was that plane that was there a min ago, single propeller look dark grey or grayish green.  As it flu passed and out of site a third UFO in the same spot as the other two came it did the same things as the first two all this took about 20 Min&#39;s.<n>

It coulnt be a reflection beause two were high and one was lower and the two high ones were not close to each other but aligned As for stars there were brighter than any star at night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There for my conclusion is they were unidentifieble flying objects<n>

The craft had no visible markings and its&#39; pencil dark color was hard to see against the dark sky.  Steady green and red lights were at the front and at the rear.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It&#39;s hard to recall if the lights were on the outer triangular points at the back because of the shock of the strange object moving so close over our heads.

I am near Hooks Airport; this not like anything I have ever seen from the airport.  I was just about to go to bed when I happen to look at the sky through the blinds at an object that was in the due east night sky about 45 degrees up and very high.  I thought it might be Venus- but I am not sure.  So I watched and over about 15 mins it did appear to be moving towards the west and slightly to the south.  The angle from me to the object increased.   At this point I went and got my digital camera and shot several pictures with the flash, until I could remember how to turn that function off and shot several more pictures.  I will send the pictures later when I have time.  I watched this object for almost 30 mins(in total) as I said before it could be Venus or something else.<n>

It was too bright. I went out my front door which faces south and looked west. The object was very bright and located southwest of me in the sky.  I ran inside and grabbed my Sony hi-def camera (HDR-SR11) and was able to take about 11 minutes worth of footage.  I was able to get about 6 minutes of a steady camera shot with a tree in the background.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I’ve seen these objects here in Texas for over 10 years.  Whatever they are they are definitely trying to act like a floating star or planet. I believe they are everywhere, but are easier to spot when you have a big sky to view them.

I was returning to one of the cabins at the Caney Conference Centre in Minden, La., when I stopped to view all the stars in the nice clear sky.  I noticed a bright light in the eastern sky and was trying to figure out what star or planet it was.  I didn’t have any of the astronomy books or magazines with me, but it just didn’t seem to be in the right place.  It was about 30 degrees on the horizon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> All of a sudden it began to move around slightly.  At first I thought it was just my eyes playing tricks.  But then it moved again.  It did this several times in about 10 minutes time, very erratically.  It would move up, down, left, down, up right, left, down, up, right, up, right, down, etc.; very random, but not very far, only maybe with in one or two degrees each move.  Then it stopped.  When it stopped this time, it looked as though there were two other lights, right next to the main/brightest light.  The brightest one was whiteish, the other lights were reddish (one to the bottom right) and blueish (one to the top left).  I had my 10x42 binoculars with me, but when I looked through them, it just looked like one big blob of light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After about 5 or so minutes of stillness, it started to move around again.  This time it did basically exactly the same as before.  Also, both times, it appeared to wind up in the exact same spot it started from.  Now, there is a small airport just down the road, but it didn’t move like any plane.  If it had been, and it was on approach, then the light/lights should have gotten bigger, further apart, and I would have heard the engine.  Not to mention it would have changed altitude gradually and not returned to the same spot where I first noticed it.  I continued to watch this lighted object for about another 30 minutes; so almost not quite an hour.  I stopped because I just figured it was some light/beacon, on a wire, or top of a pole, or something and the winds up that high were blowing stronger and moving it erratically like that.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Well the next morning (being today) I went back to the same spot, only about 50 or so yards from my cabin.  THERE IS NOTHING AT ALL IN THE AREA OF THE SKY IN THE SPOT WHERE THIS LIGHT HAD BEEN AND WAS MOVING AR0UND.  I even took out my binoculars again to see if there was something further out and very narrow that I just couldn’t make out.  Well, there wasn’t.  So that is why I thought I’d post this, just in case someone else saw the same thing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The coordinates of my position are: N 32 39&#39;52.0&#34; W093 18&#39;08.3&#34;, facing E 90deg.  This is the first time I’ve ever seen anything like this in my life; and I’ve looked for stuff out there like this.  I hope someone else out there saw, or sees the same thing in this area, and reports it here on NUFORC.  I actually live in Baton Rouge, but am here for the week.<n>

Which is more likely: ET&#39;s &amp; flying saucers or massive underground bases which control and manipulate society?  This site is obviously bogus and most likely operates on a budget from NSA black ops.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date above is incomplete.

6/23/09 23:58|Paoli|IN||3-4 seconds|Orange oval craft with an agenda|8/5/09|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/070/S70702.html|100|ndxe200906| Orange oval craft with an agenda<n> <n><n> <n><n> On the 23rd of June 25, 2009, at 11:58 PM, GPS position 38* 34&#39; 07.56 N by 86* 28&#39; 25.72 W, in Paoli, Indiana 47454. I witnessed an unidentified flying object traveling from West to East, across a clear starry night sky.  While waiting in my car and leaning out the window admiring the stars overhead and two distant aircraft strobe lights, one flying south toward Louisville, KY and the other towards the Northeast, cruising between 30 to 35 thousand feet, the object suddenly shot overhead.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The UFO was an oval shape, burnt orange in color, altitude about 15-25 thousand feet, suddenly appeared overhead, traveled from West to East at an extremely high rate of speed. Its path was horizontal, straight and true, not a random entry of space debris, meteors or fireballs. The event lasted no more than 3 seconds to cross the night sky, and did not leave a signature trail, and then disappear from my view.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had a strange sensation that this was not a random object, but rather, a controlled object with an agenda to be somewhere in a hurry. I have worked with the Air Force at NASA with some very sophisticated aircraft and equipment (Top-Secret) and never seen an object move this quickly. I believe no human could survive the G-forces in this craft, and I have not witnessed anything in our arsenal capable of attaining its speed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The size of the object was very hard to determine, since many factors could have altered my perception, but best guess, was the size of a Learjet. No visible signs, or traces of propulsion, no audible sounds (its velocity should have broken the sound barrier and every window within forty miles?)  The object was not an illusion, reflection, or projection due to its relationship and trajectory to other objects in the night sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It&#39;s sudden appearance, speed and controlled flight has bewildered my explanation of the object I witnessed.<n>

It was my son who first spotted the bright light.  It was like a large ball of light cruising the night sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At the beginning I thought it was a satelite, but satelites are usually seen to be much smaller.  So while the three of us watched the ball of light fly over our heads, we got even more surprised when it suddenly changed direction like as though doing a half circle and then went upwards and disappeared out of sight.<n>

After turning around to backtrack, I noticed two colored flashing lights in the sky horizontally placed next to each other.  It looked like a plane, except they didn’t seem to be moving, or making noise like a helicopter.  As I coasted slowly up the street, I had my gaze fixed on the object, and for almost a minute it did not appear to move.  Then a streetlight obstructed my vision for no more than a second, and the object was gone. The sky was totally clear, and there were no buildings obstructing the general area where I saw it.  I stopped my bike and stared at the sky for several minutes trying to figure out where it had gone, but I couldn&#39;t find it anywhere in the sky.  I would like to add that I am skeptical about this kind of thing, and I am not certain that I saw something paranormal, that my eyes didn&#39;t play a trick on me, but it is somewhat confusing to me.  The main reason I came to this site was to see if anyone else had seen something unusual that night.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

We seen 4 lights that where bright red and orange toward the south west part of Tucson. They disappeared right in front of us, and then 2 further west appeared. I ran inside to get the camera. When I came back out 20 seconds later they where gone. We both where like what the heck was that. After a few minutes 3 more appeared then another one, then another one. I took there pictures. And as fast as they appeared they then disappeared in a different order of how they appeared. One minute later 3 more popped up. I took there pictures. And once again as fast as they appeared they disappeared. This went on for a good 15 minutes off and on again. They where big red and orange lights.  I could not see any big body attached to the lights. But when the lights went out I could see an object behind it, but I could not make it out. It was getting dark outside. Two of them split from the pack and headed more west at the same time of 4 more coming back into view.<n> <n><n> <n><n> But I did get pictures and I will take in the camera and get them developed tomorrow.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 25 minutes from seeing the first one the Air Force had 3 planes circling the area we seen all the UFO’s.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They where not any air craft that I see every day, and that light that is was putting out was high in the sky. It was not any flares, and it was not coming from any type of air craft we have. I have lived by the Air Force base for a total of 10 years. And right by the Air Port for as many years. I have lived in Tucson for 28 years and have lived by and seen every type of plane we have and every light they put out. These where nothing we have.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thank You,<n>

I then, suddenly saw an object moving slowly across the horizon.

My eyes continued to follow it when it disappeared as if nothing was there.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I continued too watch the sky hoping to see it again.  I then saw it not once, but another time about five minutes apart. This time I realized that the object did not disappear, but actually slowly faded in too the colors of the sky. It was if it had cloaking technology.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This happened over a thirty minutes time span.  As near as I can tell it was flying over the Pacific ocean, maybe even over the naval bases.

I noticed a bright light high up. It was moving at the speed of an aircraft maybe faster, I could not determine altitude. I looked for the blinking lights of an aircraft, (Green for right wing Red for left wing) but it was a steady bright light. As it passed over it still was as bright as it was coming. Even as it flew further away the light was visible. I work as a night dispatcher  for a utilty company. I see airplanes flying over all the time, I work close to JFK. But this was not an ordinary plane. Maybe military?<n>

This was a HUGE city sized craft and was in space up 50 miles overhead. The orange lite lit it up for about 10 to 15 seconds before it vanished, I ran inside to get my binoculars and scanned the whole sky and nothing. I told my wife about it and was very excited but I never reported it or said anything to anybody, about 3 nights later after another show about the same time I was looking up and so was my wife and it did the same thing again in the same way with the orange lite. as if it had never moved. This scared the hell out of both of us and we never said another word about it. I believe its a whole city that is STEALTHED and is only visible when the light catches it just right. I dont really care if anyone believes me , just thought I better report it.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It isnt unusual to see that kind of thing, in fact I&#39;ve seen hundred of airplanes taking off from Atlanta&#39;s airport. This however was not an airplane. This light started doing unusual things. At first it was rising slowly in the sky, then it started going back down. Then it went back up, and after that I sat outside and watched this bright light fade from bright to dim and back, sometimes disappearing altogether, only to reappear in another place all within what seemed to be airspace around Atlanta for almost 2 hours. This light made zig-zag patterns in the sky. It went really high up, then came back down several times. It truly did things in the air that no modern plane could do, like jumping what seemed like great distances in split seconds and hovered in place on several occasions as well. The light also seemed to pulse when it was at its brightest. I caught some of it on my phone, and used a neighbors light in the background to compare by. I&#39;ve never seen anything like this before in my life. I even sent an alert to CNN!<n>

Not for a long distance but a short and quick little jolt. This intrigues me, so I keep watching. Again a quick jolt but now its changed form, almost like an arrowhead.  Now that shape shift could have just been my eyes going fuzzy for a second but as 15 minutes pass by, still staring at this arrangement of light, I am convinced this is not just a star for stars do not fade in and out for more than a second to two seconds at a time nor do they jolt in the form of triangles either.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I asked my father to come out and witness this as well just to tell me if it was just me and that my eyes were just going fuzzy from the staring but even he himself was baffled at this sight we both were surveying; deciding this was definitely something that was out of the ordinary.<n> <n><n> <n><n> (3:54 AM) Now as I write this it is still outside and doing its thing up by that same dim light I’ve kept track of. I am just a regular woman with no astronomical background for credibility to what I am saying in this letter but I know I’ve witnessed something that needs to be documented and seriously looked into for the sheer awareness that something else is out there and potentially observing us as well.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Star??

I have served on a U.S. Aircraft carrier and i have seen many planes.  The movements were slow then fast, sharp direction changes in Z, S and O patterns.  I would say that it had a 20,000 to 40,000 ceiling, but various and unknown with the naked eye.  No telescope or binoculars available.  My friend arrived at 22:30 EST USA and witnessed this as well and she hates to agree with me, but is 100% in agreement with me.

It took me about a minute before I saw it.  it looked to be at roughly 7000 feet.  It looked to be a flattened oval about 3/4 of an inch long.  It was moving south at a constant speed.  It was a bright white color and appeared to have a highly reflective surface.  There was no indication of wings, contrails, engine sounds or strobe lights visible on it.  it went into a cloud bank and was still visible for a few seconds before it was gone from sight. i have had weather spotter training and a fair knowledge of aircraft.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

No noise, contralis, etc.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The time was approximately, 9:15 pm on July 22 of 2009. I was in the back yard of my brother&#39;s property next door, facing south, talking to my brother who was to the east side of the property. I turned to talk to him and when I did, looked up at the trees that separate the property. I noticed an object that I would describe as looking like a pill type capsule or cigar shape. This object was bright white and obviously reflecting the setting sun. it had no noise nor did it have a contrail like conventional aircraft. It moved at a steady pace in a north south direction. There were a few clouds but, they were to the south and as the object moved off, you could still see it reflecting the light while in the clouds. I would estimate it roughly at around 7,000 ft. altitude. When I first saw it, it looked to be about 3 inches long from my vantage point on the ground. As I said, it appeared first as a cigar shape but, as it went away, it appeared as a round shape as would be expected by something of that shape moving away from you.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am a former volunteer fire fighter and a trained weather spotter so, I am familiar with the skies. I grew up near an airport and had a father who was crazy about airplanes so, I am familiar with all types of conventional aircraft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My brother did not see it at first when I pointed it out to him due to the trees but, did see it long enough to file a report also.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date corrected by source of report.

The point of it was facing the south.  It was a solid yellow color, and was completely lit up.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As soon as I saw it, it started to move south, and quickly changed color to match the color of the sky.  I could only see the outline as it moved south, behind a big cumulus cloud. It didn’t come out the other side of the cloud.<n>

The light shone through between a group of trees and a house in front of me but I could tell it was much farther away.  I immediately ran away to call someone in my apartment to the light, but when I went to get another glance before he came out it was completely gone.  It was only a minute later that I decided to file this report.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A lot of airplanes fly by here because Queens (where New York&#39;s two airports are located) is adjacent to Long Island.

June 22 2009<n> <n><n> <n><n> I noticed a pulsating light in the sky south of Oklahoma City earlier tonight. Through 10x25 binoculars I could see alternating colored lights flashing red, green and what appeared to be a gold color. There was what looked like a constant bright white light present as well. I first saw the object low in the sky and over the course of 3 hours it seemed to wander around. It would stay in one spot for 45 mins or longer then move in small partial circles or short moves horizontally and vertically.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At one point I stopped watching for about 1.5 minutes while changing positions to view from and it had either moved quite far, like from 3 o&#39;clock to about 10 o&#39;clock on the horizon, or I was seeing another one in that location. I looked in first location trying to determine if it was indeed the same object. I could only see the one, now much higher on the horizon. It appeared to be the same object I was watching a minute before.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Over the next hour it slowly kind of wandered (for lack of a better word) south until I could no longer see it.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

As i looked in to the light it tured into three diffrent lights, an the other two lights surrounded me.  I could not move,i could here a voice telling me not to worry. The voice said that it had came for me, an would tell me things that shall happen in days to come.What i seen had no shape it was just light.The light came into me,it was like it entered my mind.I was in a dream state,the voice showed me things that will happed in our world.The voice told me that no one would here me untill it was to late.<n>

Apx 11:15 PM.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was looking up at the stars with a friend N by NW of Manhattan, KS.  We both saw some type of flying object lit up.  It looked like the light was getting bigger (getting closer), then continued on a straight line for awhile, and flashed a dim light in the westward direction.  It then went behind the tree in our front yard. I hurried down the steps to the driveway to look more NE.  Right as I looked up a greenish boomerang looking light zipped extremely fast away from me. (the boomerang light seemed to be anywhere from 3000- 4000 feet up, zooming up higher).<n> <n><n> <n><n> I then calmly gathered myself and told my friend &#34;Do you believe I just saw something fly really fast away.&#34;  He told me he saw it too.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I started to shake pretty bad and started debating with him if what we had just seen was real. We sat down in the drive way and looked up and started talking, the whole &#34;What if.&#34;   We then started looking south at this neat star that was flickering like crazy.  I stood up to get a closer look, and in my view I saw a very light faded object, somewhat hard to see.  I asked Zach to quickly look up and confirm what I saw.  It was a massive hang glider looking thing that looked like it was at an extremely high altitude. It looked kind of brown, but since it was dark, you couldn&#39;t tell.<n>

It looked like it was blinking, but also, it moved quickly and slowly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> One minute, it would sit still, the next minute it would begin to zoom around.  It disappeared but we stayed outside and watched the sky for about a half hour. Then we saw a plane with another UFO behind it. The plane was blinking and at a constant speed and the UFO was behind it and then it began to go faster, and flew lower and under the air plane and then went ahead of the plane and kept going faster and farther up and up into the sky. There were about 5 of us out there that saw these odd, star-like flying objects.  What were these?<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Probable star sighting, we suspect.  PD))<n>

It was like a mass of lights all bunched together.  I couldn&#39;t tell the shape of the craft, and the lights were all different colors and blinking.  I looked, couldn&#39;t figure out what it was, and sat back down.  Then I got up a couple minutes later and looked again and it was still just sitting there.  I didn&#39;t tell any one except my dad, my husband hates talking about that stuff.  I would say that it was above the tree line a lot, but I can&#39;t tell how high that is.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Two disk-like objects both had two one large circle of yellow lights around the rim of the disks and one smaller circle of lights in the middle of the large circle. The objects were moving very fast and appeared to be not too high up in the sky. It looked like the two disks were attached to a large object because they kept rotating in a similar manner, circling each other. They were fast so I didn&#39;t have a chance to grab my photo camera and take a picture.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It sprinkled rain for a few minutes that evening and made the sky very clear with partial clouds.I was lying on my back staring at a 747 probably landing towards the long beach airport. Suddenly from the right side of my vision, i noticed two bright objects, extremely high up in altitude flying extremely fast side by side, then crossing each other as if they were flying some sort of formation, but almost as if the objects were playing, very organized. The objects were definetely not shooting stars or comets. The objects flew in a playful organized pattern across the sky at extrodonary speed. the way the objects criss crossed and exchanged paths was so amazing to see,lasted for 3-4 seconds,flying into in the distance.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I am a great believer in logic but these sightings have even got my partner stumped. these are not airplanes, i can defo admit. our skies at 10pm onwards are full of mystery. as i type this i look to see what is out there.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The light would flash bright silvery-white then pulsate from the size and brightness of Venus to a pinhead. As this was happening a group of 5 lights moving from the south to the north crossed in front of the bright flashing light. The lights were at different altitudes. The 5 lights were in a group of 3 with 2 lights off to the side.The objects made no sound. The 3 were making circles around each other as they moved. All of a sudden the 5 lights blinked off as did the very bright pulsating light. I figured the big bright light was at about 10,000ft and the 5 others were at about 8,000ft. I see a lot of planes in the sky from the San Francisco and Oakland Airport flying over head and they are that altitude judging from when they turn off their landing lights. This sighting took place in Santa Clara, California.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

At first I marked it off as an airplane, but after a few seconds I noticed it hadn&#39;t moved.  I slowed my driving to about 20 so I could focus on it better and realized that it was NOT a plane.  It was pretty far away from me, low to the ground though, but it looked big.  It was so shiny, but I could tell the craft was a grey/silver color.  I stared at it for about 2 minutes and the whole time it did NOT move, I looked away from it long enough to look at the road and back up and it was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My husband thinks I was seeing things....I don&#39;t know what it was...but all I can say is whatever I saw WAS there!<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to provide no contact information.

Not a minute after sitting there viewing the sky, a faint orange sphere which appeared to be about a 1/4&#34; in diameter (with no visual aids...telescope, binoculars) moved from a north/east to south/west direction. It took about 10 seconds to move across the whole skyline.  No sound was heard, and the orange glow almost seemed like the same glow from heated metal  I&#39;ve seen meteor showers &amp; falling stars, but this was slower then that. Also I see and hear planes &amp; choppers all the time (on there way to and from John Wayne airport)which move way slower then this objectt, not to mention I see military craft from Camp Penalton and hear bombing a San Clemente Island (or visa versa)all the time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;ve never seen anything move acrosss the sky like that before.  It was so amazing I plan to keep an eye out more often and update.<n>

This is a popular place for college kids to hang out, along with locals.  Its located in the very remote parts of the mountains in West Virginia.  We decided to camp out that night, and head out in the morning.  All five of us were on the bridge that goes across the Cheat River, we noticed a slowly moving golden nickel from far away.  It seemed as if it was ice skating in the sky at a high speed, but it was so far from us that it was hard to really tell the speed.  It last for a few minutes and then it disappeared in the distance.  We all were baffled at what we just witnessed and couldnt believe our eyes at the time.  After me and my other two friends decided to call it a night and go to the tent, my two brothers decicded to smoke another cigerette before they called it a night.  Out of no where all we heard is &#34;Its back its back that yellow light its back&#34;.  So out of no where, me and my two friends hope out the tent running to see what was going on.  We looked up in the sky over the bridge and this golden nickel bright light came over the moutain top and flew over us.  It hovered past us a slow speed and proceeded to go across the tops of the trees and out of sight.  It was the creepiest shit we ever saw in our lives!!!!!<n>

It was orange in colour and moved fast, but steadily in one direction, for about 3 minutes, whilst slowly getting smaller in size until it was no more. It made no noise and didn&#39;t leave a trail of smoke.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was white light, bright on the bottom of the craft, but the light was not radiating downward.  It seemed be flying too low to be an airplane, and as it approached (from the southeast), it was about the height of a traffic helicopter, but it was shaped like disc and larger than a helicopter.<n> <n><n> <n><n> All I could make out was the bright white light on the bottom, but I could see that it was circular in shape and had a dome on the top which was not lighted.  As it neared my subdivision, it was definitely too large to be a helicopter, but it was also silent.  There were no noises last night outside, not even the hums of air conditioning units.  I waited about a minute to see if it was going to come closer or make a noise, and then it took a northerly direction and went over the house, out of sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I found it strange that it was flying so low for its size and that it was silent.  We are near Scott AFB, Illinois, and planes often pass over but always make a sound of some sort.  I did not wake my husband to come and see and I was afraid to run to the front of the house and keep looking for it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> One other thing; we are dogsitting this weekend and the dog was out on the deck with me when I saw this object.  When the dog saw it, it ran to the sliding glass door to be let inside.  I let the dog in and sat there for about another minute.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I’ve never reported anything like this, but since I did not hear of any other reportings on the local St. Louis news stations, I wanted to report it somewhere else to see if others saw what I saw.   I am a 50-year old female, married with one child, and I am a business manager at a major university in St. Louis.<n>

Part of the group, about 6 of them split up and headed northwest.  A couple of those then faded out.  The others remained in the same general area as before the spilt but gained in altitude.  The ones that had headed northwest then joined up back with the other ones and they formed a v or a y shape as they started gaining altitude.  At this point, there were 7 of them.  Then they all headed up , gaining altitude and then quickly faded out. Each fireball appeared to be moving independently, not forced to move from the wind.  There were no noises associated.<n>

While we were at the drive-in, we witnessed a total of 13 flying aircraft that each illuminated a very bright light and was clearly visible.  What was amazing about the 13 aircraft was they were able to connect together with each another and then they were able to completely detach themselves which occurred a number of times.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The 13 flying aircraft completely defied logic with the flight pattern they were flying on since they possessed the capability of attaching back to one another at will.  It is beyond anything I have ever witnessed in my life and for any two known aircraft to be able to fly that close to each other would have certainly resulted in a crash, let alone 13 total aircraft being able to do so.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was truly something not of this world, or if so something that the government certainly is keeping from us.<n>

The light looked like it was coming from something burning.  It had a red-orange color and was not blinking or fading.  It appeared to be 20-30,000 feet high and was flying slowly.  It made a couple of small turns to the left and right, but mainly followed a path from south to north.  At one point it stopped moving and remained stationary for a minute or so.   It then appeared to fly straight vertically fairly rapidly and the large round fiery looking light grew smaller and smaller until it finally disappeared completely.  The entire viewing time was three to five minutes in length.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was not a tail of flames, just a large round light with the color of something burning.  If it was 20-30,000 feet up, the size of the object would have been very large (many hundreds of feet in diameter if not 1,000’).  It may have been closer to the ground though since all we could see was a large light, definitely not a point source.   Also, at no point could we see any other object than the light.<n>

At about 8:30 PM, when we noticed a triangular shaped craft moving at an extremely high speed at a very high altitude.It had a red-yellow light and zig-zagged. and then it stopped and hovered for a while.  Then we noticed another one come and do the same thing. And then another one came and did the same thing. the crafts seemed to make a triangular formation. I ran inside to get my telescope.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I came back out my two friends and I looked up to see they had vanished. about three minutes later they returned to sky. about fifteen minutes later, they left at incredible speed up into the sky and we did not see them again.<n>

This object was rectangle in shape and standing on end, moving at around half the speed of a normal sized two setter prop plan and was traveling east to west, it would get really bright then back to silver like color, it did this the whole time we viewed it. I know what satellites look like at night as well as flares at dusk plus this was below the clouds and the clouds appeared to be at about 3000-4000 ft. I was thinking it was a balloon but how could it get so shinny on a cloudy day not to mention move against the wind??? Then the strangest thing happened and this is why I’m emailing this report… the object just stopped in mid air and hovered for about 30-45 seconds b/4 the clouds covered it…. I’ve never seen anything like this b/4 as I’m an amateur astronomer now for about 30 years and have seen some cool stuff out there b/4 but NEVER LIKE THIS!!!!!<n>

I saw what looked like a plane or maybe a bird but was too far away to tell. The nose facing us but it did not appear to be moving: We watched it hovering for 5 minutes. Then the object turned where the wing was towards us and the nose of the object facing south. But the object was still hovering.  We also noticed there were 2 jets overhead that were leaving a vapor trail.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A second object appeared from behind the trees and was much closer and same shape.  Second object only visible for 45 sec before it disappeared very quickly. There was no sound from either object.   They were both shaped like a bird but there was no wing movement.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We continued to watch the object for 10 minutes with no movement of the object. But what it did next was very strange.  Suddenly, the object &#34;took off&#34; shooting toward the northeast in a straight line.  No noise, no movement of the wings no swooping gliding movement like a bird.  It was too large to be a bird. It Looked much larger than a private plane.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We then could observe this object hovering between two trees to the north We watched it for another 4-5 minutes before it shot off to the northwest.  It flew very fast and did not deviate from the direct line.  Zoom and it was gone.<n>

I did not hear any noise coming from this. I kept looking at it until we were out of sight. It had a bright glow as it was dark so it really stood out.<n>

Looking south, I saw what at first appeared to be a very reflective airplane about 30 degrees above the horizon tracking smoothly across the sky  from south-southeast towards the northwest.  After a few seconds, I realized that I was not seeing an airplane-- at least not one like I have ever seen before.  It looked like a cluster of several very bright lights arranged in a tight formation, scintillating.  I became quite excited and ran inside to get my camera.  When I came out the formation had moved overhead and further along its smooth northwesterly trajectory.  I took video of the object as it passed by and receded.  I videoed for about two minutes.  The cluster is visible in the video, but the details of the formation are too small to be clearly discerned.   The formation was composed of two or three very bright lights along with a few smaller and dimmer lights in-between.  The cluster at first looked diamond- or cross-shaped, but after passing overhead it took on a more triangular appearance.  There was no noise.  The object did not leave a trail.  The whole event lasted about 3 or 4 minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Dallas, Texas<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is the second time I have seen this disk with flashing red, white, green lights. First time was June 9th, 2009.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Last night while sitting on my patio looking West, I saw it again.  Same color formations coming from underneath that rotated right to left which is what caught my eye.  No planes fly that late at night.   It sat in the West sky and moved slowly.   Eventually, it grew harder and harder to see as if traveling away.  Then it was gone.  This lasted for 20-30 minutes.   The first time I saw this craft was June 9th, 2009.  It was in the West sky but in a different area and not the same place as last night.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I estimate the time of the event to be around 22:30, though I may have been mistaken since we had just been hanging out all night and not paying attention to time. My friend and I were outside smoking, and she looked up in the sky and pointed out to me what we both thought was a satellite. It was moving south-southeast We watched it briefly (about five seconds), only to see it stop mid-flight, jerk to the northeast (diagonally up and left from its position), and begin flight again. The object continued this pattern of stopping and re-starting for the next thirty to forty seconds. Its timing was very sporadic as was the degree to which it adjusted its flight path. When we started losing sight of it, I climbed up on top of my chair, but could not see it anymore due to the light pollution on the horizon. I walked inside and told my boyfriend, who was sitting on the sofa watching tv, exactly what we saw. My friend confirmed everything. My boyfriend told us that he had seen objects like that in the sky over the beach before.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Neither my friend nor myself could discern a specific shape or color to the object as it was very high in the atmosphere. The area in which the sighting occurred is close to the Canaveral National Seashore, so there is a possibility that it was some sort of government intelligence.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My friend and I are both twenty years old. She and I were room mates at the University of Alabama for one semester, after which I moved to the eastern Florida coast and she moved to a suburb outside of New York City. We&#39;re both hard-working students. My friend is pursuing a degree in nursing, while I&#39;m busy studying chemistry so that I can do research someday. I&#39;m also a waitress in a local wine bar. My friend had been working at a Red Lobster part-time. My boyfriend has a bachelors degree in economics from the University of Florida, but due to the economy he works at a local restaurant on the beach. Until February of this year, he worked overnight (from the time the restaurant closed until about 5:00) doing security and some maintenance.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Error in date.

The object appeared about 75 degrees above the horizon. It was too far away to be seen as more than a light, similar to a star or aircraft. However, the object appeared at first too bright to be a star or even an aircraft. The object then began to get dimmer, but from left to right, like it was turning.  It started moving in an easterly direction, and slightly upward. It then got dimmer and started moving faster. It then dimmed so much it seemed to disappear to one witness. The other witness could still see it and it continued to move and then slowly disappear, like it “winked out” of existence, but gradually. Both witnesses continued to watch the sky but did not see it return. Within 20 seconds, two airplanes were observed flying loosely in the same direction as the observed object but from different directions.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

When we (2 adults) turned to look at where they were pointing (to the east) we saw a fairly large, brightly lit “flying craft” in the sky just above the treetops and houses moving towards us.  I first assumed it was a prop plane flying low, but immediately realized it was not the shape of an airplane (or firework or comet or military plane, etc).<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was a boxy-circular shape (somewhat trapezoidal at first), very brightly lit with an orange-yellow light.  The entire craft was covered with a haze that seemed to diffuse the perimeter edges, which is why I can’t put a name to the shape.    There was a brighter spot of light in the center of the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was moving towards the park clearing, but when the kids started shouting and pointing the craft stopped moving forward and began to hover.  It hovered for several seconds, and then began moving back – to the east – in the direction that it was originally coming from.  As it got smaller it seemed to change into an elongated oval, then in an instant it was just gone!  Two of the children said it was as if when they started pointing and shouting, the craft “noticed them” and stopped moving towards us.    It was pretty close to us, but there was no noise.  It was totally silent.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In all, we watched it for approximately 20 seconds.  The children saw it for about 5 seconds longer because they saw it first.<n>

In the distance, some five miles away, an airliner that had taken off from the Salt Lake International Airport heading due south and slowly gaining altitude when I noticed two aircraft flying parallel to the airliner but most likely closer to my position.    The two craft, in formation, then made a right 90 degree turn and came directly east towards my position and then made another hard 90 degree turn and flying due north over me at maybe 200 to 400 feet, at about the State Street Exit.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The time I had to view these craft including paying attention to traffic and observing was at least one minute.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The craft appeared to behave aerodynamically.   They seemed to cover quite a bit of territory in a short time, at least four to six miles.  When they made their turn just before passing over me, they must have been near a stall speed to make such a sharp turn and for me to view them in as much detail.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I heard no engines, prop or jet.   The Craft were approximately the same size as a military fighter plane, or smaller.   My window was down, but I think I would have heard something over the noise of the traffic.   I-80 is under construction and the max speed is 60 mph, and the traffic was light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The odd appearance of these craft is the reason for this report.  The fuselage was long and cylindrical, coming to a point at the front and rear in the usual aerodynamic configuration.   The wings began about mid point of the length fuselage shaft.    The appearance of the wing configuration, in plan view, is that of a bird with wings spread out.   The leading edge of wing seemed to sweep forward and then back again at the end of the wing, with the rear of the wing flaring back toward the fuselage.   The color was a white or silvery white.    I couldn’t remember seeing any secondary wing or tail stabilizer in the rear.    There was no forward secondary wing in front of the shaft as one would expect of so long of a forward portion of the fuselage.    No cockpit canopy could be seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Upon reviewing what I had just seen, the wings appeared to have a wide black line that followed the contour of perimeter of the wing, and set back from the edge of the wing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I latter called the Salt lake City Airport and talked to the air tower representative and described what I had seen, At first he stated that these craft could be from any number of different government agencies, he then stated that they were most likely VFR craft used in mosquito abatement.   I said they had pretty sophisticated equipment for crop dusting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I will send a copy of a sketch that I had drawn.<n>

Three minutes passed  and I was walking across the kitchen when I see a flat disk.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I first thought it was a plane but it was staying still floating in the air planes cant stay still they have to move forward so I went to my window and saw it was flat. I instantly thought thought it was a U.F.O (Unidentified Flying Object) , and I was shocked because I always wanted to see one.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Suddenly its lights start flickering and the lights streamed across going from red to green to purple white blue and all sorts of colors.  I was so amazed the first thing that came to my mind was camera.  I went to my room to get a camera and I came back and started to take pictures but there was a tree blocking it and it was fairly 500 yards away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I then try to zoom in and move around the tree but when I got a good shot my  camera screen turned blue like some sort of static water picture. I tried to take pictures but all it would take is blue images. I then called my friend to see if he can see it.  But then it just  starts to faint away and becomes invisible but when a minute passes it comes back brighter again streaming with colors.  I then heard police sirens because someone had called the police.  It kept disappearing and appearing again and again like about three times for about half a hour then it disappears and doesn’t appear back.<n>

Coachella Valley over Santa Rosa Mountains.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On June 19, 2009, in Bermuda Dunes, CA 92203, a ufo was sited at ~75 degrees in angle vertically facing SouthWest. I was looking at the landscaping of the backyard with my brother, sitting on a patio chair facing South. There was very little moonlight and the stars were very clear and beautiful. All of a sudden, in my peripheral, I saw a bright light up to the upper-right of my eyes. I looked and it was very fireball looking like the brightest star in the sky which I knew I hadn’t seen before as I had been star gazing for about 30 minutes. The light was circular and dimmed out very quickly as it moved in an upward/southern/away motion on an xyz plane and looked as if it was moving slower and slower as it finally, slowly went out of sight. This lasted ~15 seconds. I had seen 2 other very same instances of the very same way which one happened in the very same place (at my new home and in the same area). The other instace was ~3years ago, only this one looked like a satellite moving across the sky from north to south and I was looking Eastward. It stopped for about 5 seconds, then slowly lowered for about 3 seconds and stopped again. It right away seemed to get much brighter like a spotlight looking left of me (northwest). It rotated 3 seconds until it finally seemed to be facing directly at me. I called my friend to look which was running from the patio which was about 50 feet away, and right away (coincidentally as if it heard me, just like when I called my other friend to look at the most recent siting), the object went in the same motion only moved SouthEast; then was as dim as original brightness. It began moving in the same direction as originally with what looked like the same angle of height (about same as other sitings) for about 3 seconds and when he finally got to me, the light was faded out of sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

At first I though they were light beams from the ground but there was no light leading up to them. They also were not moving in a repetative motion but darting about around the cloud. It was a fairly clear night but had a vast amount of whispy cloud which the lights seems to stay in. Every now and then one would vanish and then re-appear and at time they would almost join together, I was totally fascinated and couldnt stop watching as I couldnt figure out what they could be. Then one of the totally vanished and about a minute laster the other one vanished too. I still stood there in awe for another few minutes as I couldnt believe what I had seen and am still trying to come up with a rational explanation.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The dish looked as if it was like a platinum metal and also as if it had welded seams. By the time we darted and opened the front door of the house, it had become a small spec and as it was leaving in the distance it was escalating. This was not a comet or meteor or shooting star.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I was using a pair of 15x70 binoculars and the distance between the lights was about half of the viewing diameter of the binoculars. The objects covered approx. a 45 degree angle of sky from my position in about 15 seconds. The two outside lights were in a stationary pattern as they moved across the sky, while the third trailed slightly and moved back and forth between the two outside lights. This is approx. how they looked:<n> <n><n> <n><n> From this:  *            *             *<n> <n><n> <n><n> To this:             * *                                  *<n> <n><n> <n><n> The trailing light moved back and forth between the two as they moved north. The lights appeared to be about the same size as the background stars. My daughter was not able to see the lights herself with the naked eye, and by the time she got her binoculars focused in the direction of the lights, they had moved beyond our viewing range.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Also, approx. 20 minutes after the first sighting, we both observed a single light moving south to north at approx. the same speed as the first lights, followed about three minutes later by another single light moving in the same direction and speed.<n>

I happened to look up into the sky as I usually do and noticed an odd shaped object moving from South to North at a fast pace. I wouldn’t be able to give an actual figure as far as it’s height off of the ground mostly because it was a densely dark object. One thing that intrigued me is that it was running silent and had no blinking lights whatsoever.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Also, due to the fact that it was dark, it was fairly invisible in the night sky. The only reason I was able to notice it and distinguish its shape (fairly triangular) was because it flew just under some glowing night-time clouds. It flew right through a known air traffic lane. So soon after it passed the clouds it became invisible once more and then a passenger aircraft flew through the same airspace at approximately the same altitude, which allowed me to guess its size as roughly that of a large truck.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It all happened very fast.  It was a partly cloudy night, so had it not been for the small cloud it passed under I would guess that I wouldn’t have noticed it at all.<n>

We then realized it was moving and was in front of the mountain.  We watched it move from south to north as it slowly lost altitude and became dimmer.  My wife ran into the house and grabbed the camera and we got a few pictures of it.  Upon looking at the pictures it didn&#39;t look red (like fire) but white and after cropping the picture it appeared to be diamond shaped.  There was absolutely NO noise what-so-ever coming from this craft at any time during the sighting.  It eventually became so dim we couldn&#39;t see it any more.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It had a red light that was spinning over the top and back under I would say it was oval or maybe football shaped approximate flying at 500 ‘-750 ‘ it moved quite quickly and absolutely silent.  It was the silence that sent chills up my spine. I am absolutely certain after seeing what I saw that it could not be a plane or helicopter. I was an air traffic controller in the u.s.n. I know aircraft. This was something else.<n>

Two of us were sitting on the balcony of our oceanfront hotel.  It was about 23:15 on June 17, 2009, and we were sitting and watching the waves and looking at the stars.<n> <n><n> <n><n> All of a sudden, three bright lights appeared in the sky.  We didn&#39;t know what they were.  They started out in a triangle formation.  But after a few seconds, they all moved into a straight line.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The three lights stayed in a line for a few more seconds before disappearing.   A loud rumble of thunder followed (it was a clear night, and it was not storming).<n> <n><n> <n><n> The two who  saw the lights called the rest of our family out to the balcony, but they were too late.  All they heard was the loud rumble of thunder.<n>

At times there would be 1 light that lasted a few seconds and sometimes there would be 2 or 3 lights that did the same. They were over the ocean and stayed in the same spot. They would be there and then dissappear. This happened at least 4 times all in about 30 to 40 minutes. The lights would sometimes look like a line and sometimes not.They sometimes looked as if it were some kind of round object as well.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

As we were sitting down, we immediately noticed a bright orange twinkling dot in the sky. At first impression, we both agreed that it looked like a flaming airplane! It was traveling northwest in the sky at a good clip; and we continued thinking that it was some sort of airplane...on flames possibly. Very abruptly however, it just stopped. It continued to hover and twinkle for aprox. 40 seconds. At one point towards the end of the 40 seconds, I waved and said &#34;HI!&#34; at the top of my lungs. Immediately after that, it started to fade slightly, at which point I noticed a very faint triangle coming from the &#34;flaming dot&#34; (the dot being at the very top of the triangle). As soon as I noticed this, it gracefully faded into nothingness.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.  PD))<n>

The lights were in a straight line, were colored red,bluish/green and yellow and were flashing one after the other continuously.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Within less than 1 minute, in my peripheral vision, I noticed another identical object following the same path and with exactly the same flashing light colors and pattern. These lights never moved out of the straight line formation which makes me believe that they were on some sort of craft, but I couldn&#39;t make out the shape. The only thing I can give for measurements is BOTH were about half an inch if I held my hand at arms length.<n> <n><n> <n><n> While keeping my eyes glued to the 2 craft, another set of lights came into my peripheral vision from the left( also traveling from NE to SW following the same path as the previous 2-which were still visable to me). This time there were 4 lights in the shape of a square-with one light on each corner. The 2 leading lights were yellow and the 2 back lights were red. These lights did NOT blink and the square between the lights covered up the stars it passed. Again, this object measured 1/2 inch holding my hand at arms length. There was absolutely NO sound associated with these 3 groups of lights and they all continued on the same flight path, one after the other. The entire episode lasted 5 minutes from the time I noticed the first lights until the 3 objects were too far away to see anymore.<n>

Behind these trees I saw a glowing orange yellow ball that looked like a harvest moon, except that it was behind the trees and the tree’s silhouette could be seen in front of the orange “moon- like” shape.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I kept looking at this, trying to comprehend what I was seeing and how this might be happening. It made no sense in my mind.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was wearing glasses and thought maybe this was some sort of light being reflected off of my lenses and that I was mistaken in what I was seeing. I took off my glasses and the orange ball/circle was still there.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I turned  around into the back screen door to call out my partner to come and see this and turned away for only a moment.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I looked back it was gone! No noise at all. It was just no longer sitting behind the trees there.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have never seen anything like this before or since.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I thought this was a shooting star or something. Then another bright starlike light shone to just the east of it, but this one started shooting around wildly like a binball machine, erratic and quickly with no discernable pattern and at extreme angles, but completely unlike a plane possibly could, within about a 5 in radius (from my perspective).<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then this light headed southward at a more steady pace, and as it went I could see several lights blinking quickly in different colors - red, white, blue, green - but these lights blinked randomly and all around a two inch-long object that I could just vaguely see (It seemed very high up). At one point they almost seemed to light up rapidly in a &#39;band&#39; across the width of the object. It looked slightly grey against the deep blue sky, and it appeared to have an elongated point at it&#39;s head and possibly two shorter points at its end with a concave bottom - possibly chevron shaped (it may have had more points to it, but it was very unclear). All the blinking lights were no bigger than most of the stars around the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As it headed south overhead it traveled about the speed of a plane way high up, but it kept blinking these colored lights in a random effect all over the face of it. Then smaller white lights began shooting away from it one &amp; two at a time in all directions, going away up to about 5-6 inches. It still had a main white light, brighter than the rest, which continued to blink at erratic but consistent intervals. We watched it do this until it was very far south, to the distant tree line. Small lights continually came off from it, although they were very hard to see once it had reached that far away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About 10 minutes later, the lights of what looked to be a regular airplane, with one white light &amp; one red flashing at regular &amp; consistent intervals, crossed the sky in the same path and disappeared at the same point beyond the trees.<n>

While a break in the clouds shielded my eyes from direct sunlight, I saw at what I presume was very high altitude, because of the very small size of the object, a metallic silver teardrop shaped craft without wings move slowly toward the North and then just as suddenly vanish!  Watched the sky for several more minutes before the dark clouds again blocked my view, but never saw the object reappear.  I am sure it was not a plane!  No wings of any kind visible and no sound.  Wind was at high altitude not ground level, therefore listened but could hear no sound of engines.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

What brought it to my attention was 2 days ago about 1:30am 2 of these bright yellow objects appeared to come into the atmosphere, first 1 on the left and came to a stop followed 3 sec later by another bright yellow object which was coming into the atmosphere just to the right of the left object except the object on the right slowed down coming in and then slowly reversed out of the atmosphere followed by the first object reversing 3 sec after the 2nd object reversed. Really thought they were satelites falling back to earth that was until the 2nd object stopped and reversed back the way it came in.I was hoping someone seen this somewhere else on the globe this day !!<n>

Saw a bright red light in the sky.  It was as bright as a stop light and was not pulsating or blinking.  Thought it was an aircraft or a helicopter , but it did not have any additional lights blinking as an air plane would have.  The light appeared to be higher than an aircraft would be flying in the area.   The light hovered in the sky and was not moving for several minutes.  The light proceeded to move from west to east gaining altitude but remained bright.  Still driving, watched as it moved away towards the east, but it stopped again and was not moving.  Watched for 10 more minutes and realized it was moving again, this time in a southerly direction.  It appeared to be moving further away in a southerly direction, suddenly I realized it moved back towards the west and back closer to where it was before.  It continued to move south and then started gradually moving towards the east again until it was out of sight.  Overall, I observed the object for 20 to 25 minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

We were at the beach for bands on the beach that happens every Tuesday night.  It was dark outside and therefore no sunlight left in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I was talking to my girlfriend, looking over the gulf, I noticed what looked like a slow moving  white cloud that was very hard to see about 200-300 yards out over the water.  It was awkward because it was the only one in the sky and seemed to be moving in a smooth and slow motion.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My girlfriend then noticed it and we began to watch the object as it moved east, then stopped, and started moving west.  We both watched as the object stopped near the end of the pier, and then seemed to turn and move over the pier.  When first passing over the pier, the lights from the pier, which were orange in color, seemed to reflect from the front of this object.  As it moved over the pier, it was still very hard to see and determine its full shape.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After reaching the end of the pier it was in a closer proximity to me.  I could see what looked to be very small and dim lights moving north to onshore.  These lights were in the general shape of a triangle or boomerang.  The shape was constantly changing though, as we watched the object move further onshore, the object(s) began to conform to more of a ball-shape.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then the object(s) seemed to vanish. It didn’t speed off, but was just gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The entire movement of this object was slow.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was never any noise emitted from this object.<n>

My friend calls me, and says he is looking at a UFO. &#34;Its a crazy light in the sky, out over the ocean.&#34; He described a light like a star, but changing color abnormally, and dropping other lights out of it. I was skeptical, but the sound in his voice unnerved me. I decided to take a look for my self. he described the location to me, in reference to the big-dipper. At first i didn&#39;t see anything, but soon had a VERY clear visual conformation. All the hair on my head was standing up, and I could barely maintain my composer.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A bright light in the western sky, moving around in circles and lines. It was creating shapes and changing color. also little red lights would occasionally fall from the moving light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About twenty-five minutes into the colorful display, a helicopter from a near by hospital, flew near by where I was. This gave me a nice compairssion. This was not a helicopter, and was not that far away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At this point I was kinda scared. The next thing to happen really freaked me out! A small light appeared a good distance North from the original object. I saw it first, and asked my friend if he too saw this new light. As soon as he saw it it burst into a massive bright light. It was moving smoothly, and got brighter and brighter. It was south bound, headed right for the other one. As this light approached the first, it dimmed and slowed. At this point I could no longer doubt what I was seeing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The original light was still in the sky when I started this report. I have my friend on the phone, and he told me it left. I went out side to see, and sure enough it is now gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My friends Girl friend also witnessed this event.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was stationary but it was far too bright to be a star or a planet.  I took my pair of binoculars to get a better look.  It was a very bright light and it was still stationary about 40 degrees over the horizon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I sat outside and watched the light, comparing it to the few other stars that were shining.  I then noticed it was moving slowly upward.  The light stayed the same size but now it started to move faster and even looked like it was heading towards my direction.  Within 4 to 5 seconds it had moved almost directly over top, but slightly to the north of my house.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object moved passed my house and was headed almost directly west.  As it was going past my house I could clearly see the object.  It was a solid triangular shape object with lights underneath. It was not a smooth bottom, it had some kind of curved ridge along the centre underneath.  I could clearly see the shape with the binoculars.  At first I thought it was a stealth plane as I could hear a noise as it passed over.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Within 20 seconds I could see jets coming.  I usually watch jets at night but these were not the usual pattern.  One came from approx. NE direction and the came from a more easterly direction.  I could hear them coming and see their blinking lights.  As they flew over, I could barely see the wing pattern.  They were clearly following the first object and moving very fast.<n> <n><n> <n><n> If the jets were at the same altitude as the first object then I would have to say the first object was massive.  It is hard to judge the height the object was flying.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am submitting this report because I had a weird incident on Friday, June 12/09 at almost the exact same time of night and almost the exact same starting location in the sky.  This is why I went outside again tonight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Last Friday night I observed a very bright light in the sky.  Same spot as tonights&#39; but the light was blinking on Friday.  I thought it was a weird blinking light, not like plane lights at all. It had some different colours too. I called my husband out to look but he is a Detroit Red Wing Fan and the final game was almost over and he didn&#39;t what to look.  He did come out the house and said, Yes, Its a blinking light and then went back to his game.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I got the binoculars and looked at the light. I could clearly see it was a round object and had rotating lights. The lights rotated quickly but not so quickly that I could see the different colours.  Red, blue, green, yellow/white lights.  The lights rotated from left to right. I watched the lights for about 10 15 minutes and then it started to fade outward but appeared to be in the same location.  After some time it only appeared as a star and then I lost sight of it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I live in a very rural area and the night sky is a clear view.  Please do not publish any confidential information about me.  This is unusual and I can&#39;t explain what it was.<n>

My viewing was limited, as I was looking straight up and could see it until a house blocked my view. I would say about 30 degrees out from my view straight up. The craft looked like three lights on  jumbo jets wing(which would only have one light). The formation was aligned at a slight angle and flew at a high rate of speed silently.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Then I noticed there was a second object hundreds of miles away from the first object, both moving in complete and utter sinc with each other.  It was two objects, because there were stars between them, but they seemed to mirror one another, never differing in distance from one another, both moving jaggedly but in complete sinc with one another, through space.  It struck me as the oddest thing I&#39;ve ever seen.  Speaking nothing of the strangeness of their movements at such obvious distance from eachother, the things resembled satelites in color and size.  The whole thing lasted less than 5 minutes, until they were out of site beyond the tree line.<n>

It was like a distortion moving across the sky.  I would not have seen it if it had not been so close, and it moved in front of a cloud just over my car.  The effect did not break up like an atmospheric anomaly.  I am sure that this is what stealth using light would look like.  I was alone this time, but this same thing was also witnessed later in the same area by someone else.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

6/14/09 23:35|Woodbury|MN|Circle|45 seconds|nightime, fuzzy circle (a bit brighter than a nightime cloud) with an intermittently flashing amber light beneath, moving quickly NNW.|8/5/09|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/070/S70504.html|218|ndxe200906| nightime, fuzzy circle (a bit brighter than a nightime cloud) with an intermittently flashing amber light beneath, moving quickly NNW.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The event occurred as I was on the north side of my home just gazing at the night sky directly to the east of my location.  There were a few visible clouds in that direction but I would not be able to tell how high they were but they were not low clouds..perhaps a couple miles or more in altitude.  As I was scanning the sky, I noticed an minimally bright object maybe a bit brighter than the clouds themselves against the night sky.  It was moving perhaps 2-3 times or so as fast as satellites I’ve seen but in a north-northwesterly direction.  I could not tell how big or how far away it was but it seemed to go behind a cloud (as it dimmed).  The cloud seemed thick enough to obscure light though but I could still see the object.  It seemed to be a perfectly circular shape about the brightness of a cloud with fuzzy, out-of-focus edges.  It was about the size of a pencil eraser in an outstretched hand.  It moved quickly, in my estimation and then slowed a bit and changed to a more west-north-west direction and then appeared to speed up and head North-northwest again and it went out of my line of sight over some houses.  I had wondered if my vision was fuzzy initially but I changed my mind about that almost right after I saw the object because directly below the fuzzy circle (at a distance of about 1-1/2 to 2 diameters of the circle) was a small, intermittently flashing amber light.  It did not seem to flash regularly and if I were to guess, each flash was between 1 second to 5 seconds apart.  It seemed to be the same color of amber that I have only seen once before.  After 9-11, the Twin Cities skies were devoid of all aircraft, of course, but I went to look at the quiet sky a day or two afterward and remember seeing the same color of amber light flying above us in the night sky.  It was a couple F-16s patrolling the airspace around us.  We never see F-16s in this area of Minnesota so when I saw that deep amber color and read that F-16s were in the area, I knew it was a special military beacon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I heard no sound from whatever I saw.  My first thought was that I would describe what I saw as a fuzzy white, circular balloon with an intermittently flashing amber light beneath it.  I am curious if anyone else has seen something like this.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Over the last couple weeks I&#39;ve continued to notice multiple balls of lights rising in the Eastern horizon,the lights seem to be rising out of the Bull Run Battlefield in the Direction of Washington DC. These multiple lights will slowly rise than after a few minutes they would have risen so high you could know longer see them. I figured they were airplanes and since I couldn&#39;t get a closer look I wasn&#39;t convinced these lights were anything unusual and certainly not paranormal. That all changed last night when I was finally able to get a closer look at these amazing lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My wife and I decided to take a walk since the temperature had cooled from the heat earlier in the day. Just as we got to the top of our neighborhood(an area that is very dark and gives you a excellent 360 degree view of the night time sky)we noticed a very bright amber light rising from the NE Horizon. The light raised straight up, I would estimate approximately 5,000 feet. When the light raised to the estimated 5,000 feet it stopped and remained stationary for several minutes.  The light then started drifting slowly towards the SW. Since it was dark we brought along with us a small flashlight. Coincidentally the flashlight had a small red laser light attached. As the light drifted and was now due East from us I got the laser light and flashed it a couple times towards this anomaly. This is still difficult to fully understand but as soon as I finished flashing the laser light the light in the sky stopped. It completely stopped and was just silently hovering due East from our position. I said to my wife &#34;you don&#39;t think the light stopped because I flashed the laser do you&#34;. As we stood their stunned and watching the light I decided to flash the laser a couple more times.  Any skepticism that I had prior to this sighting all ended when this light unbelievably flashed back at us in four bright intervals-Flash-Flash---Flash-Flash. Unable to believe my eyes I flashed my light again at the light.  At this point the brightness of the light which was still stationary started to dim to where we could barely see it. The light then started to move directly up and continued on this path until it was know longer visible.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This was an unbelievable experience and one that will be with me for the rest of my life.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thank You<n>

Somebody purposely blew up something out in space, beyond our atmosphere.  I was watching the tiniest of dot crossing the sky when all of a sudden there was an &#34;explosion&#34; where the &#34;dot&#34; was headed.  Then the tiny dot was going back the way it came, but flashed, very brightly, twice right after the explosion.  It continued in the reverse direction moving faster than when it was headed for the explosion.  Happened all so quickly.  About 1/2 an hour later, from the exact place that the explosion was, I saw a &#34;falling star&#34;.  This very bright object was bright for about an inch (thumb at arms length), was blank for about two inches, then bright again for about 6 inches before vanishing.  I watched for about two hours longer but didn&#39;t see anything else.  I really wish that if anyone else saw this or knows what it was all about, that you would let us know.  It was obvious that something deliberately blew something up, then half hour later the object entered our atmosphere and burned up.  Cool stuff!!<n>

I was standing at my living room window in the Sunset District of San Francisco watching the sunset over the ocean when I saw them.  As they approached I questioned if in fact they were planes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They were absolutely quite.  It seemed one was following the other.  They moved in a straight line almost directly toward me.  One got close enough that I could see four lights, one red, one yellow and 2 white lights.  The lights were pulsating.  Then I moved to my bedroom window trying to get a better view.  They were both still there after I transitioned rooms.  My bedroom window also has an ocean view looking west but is more south than my living room window.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then it seemed they were out of view so I went to my back decks on the east side of my building and saw them again.  They were still heading southeast and seemed to be heading toward a third object that looked like a star.  At the closest the larger one seemed the size of an eraser on a pencil.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then a fourth one came from the southwest and seemed to be heading north not following the others.  That one was quite big also, in that it was just over the rooftops and could not have been a star in that case. It also had 4 pulsating lights red, yellow and 2 white lights. It seemed a bit closer than the other two that seemed to pass overhead of the building I was in. All in all it felt like I watched for a good 10 to 15 minutes.  There was no sound at all and no trails of any sort.  I was not able to see any of them by the time the sun set.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What did I see?  Today is 6/14/09.  It is now 10:14pm.  This sighting occurred as the sun set. It was quite a beautiful sunset in a clear sky after a warm clear day.<n>

That’s what got me looking up in the first place. I then noticed a light traveling north. The color was orangish and seem to pulsate.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was traveling in the opposite direction of the wind, though  at different altitudes the wind could travel in another. I would say it was 15,000 to 20,000 feet high. The speed wasn’t very fast.  I tried to get another park goer to see it but it went behind a passing cloud. The other party reported to me that he has noticed strange lights in the sky for the massed few months in the area as well.<n>

After watching it for a few seconds we noticed the lights were flashing non stop instead of twice and then a pause like a jet. We also noticed it was flying at a higher rate of speed, at first it was a long ways behind what was clearly a jet but it quickly caught up and zoomed past it. It then went behind trees so we couldn&#39;t see it. We came in my house and went to look out of an upstairs window (this took approximately 5 minutes) by the time we got to the window it was all the way across the sky. It flew in a zig zag pattern for awhile and moved over to the left side of the window.  We then noticed there was another identical object on the right side of the window.  The two objects began to fly very fast toward each other, and when they got very close they turned orange and the one on the right began to get dimmer and dimmer till it disappeared.  We continued to watch the one on the left till it disappeared behind the trees.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

I immediately pulled my witness directly into the yard and said what is that, do you see that?  She said yes, I see it..It was a definite triangle shaped with a illuminated brownish red tint moving slowly.  NO noise just smoothly cruising west over our rural country side.  This is the first time I have seen anything like this in the sky.  The triangle shape was definite.  It was that low for us to see the details.

The sky was clear except for very high brushing of clouds. I watch the object waiting to see the supposed Hawk flap his wings.  Thats when a Jet flying into O&#39;hare at about 18 thousand feet flew over.  The jet was lower then the object I thought was a hawk in the high sky. I watch the object which was dark gray or light black fly South South east in a Wooble pattern as best as I can explain. It didnt travel straight, more of a curve in the sky.  My best guess at the size would be about 20 feet long in an egg shape. The object made no noise at all.  Wind was blowing out of the west that day.  Im curious if anyone besides me and my son seen this. It was nothing I had ever seen before.<n>

When the lights stopped looked like a star.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Last night I was sitting in a lawn chair just enjoying the night sky when I saw what looked like a star moving west to east about to pass up the big dipper. I thought maybe a satellite. So I ran inside and got my daughter and her friend.  Then I showed them where the object was and we were all watching it move. When it stopped and changed directions one of the girls said I thought satellites were suppose to move in one direction. Third grade stuff right? One of the lights met another that had started to move then moved apart and they both were still and did not move. If I was by myself nobody would believe me. After that a third light that looked like a star as well moved from around the dipper heading in an eastern direction. When it disappeared I went inside.  It was midnight. I know that a star is suppose to be fixed in space.  I seen two shooting stars to the east sky as the unidentified flying objects were moving in the northern sky. That was the second time I have seen something while I was in my yard.<n>

I could see, from the ring of light, a shadow of a (maybe) delta wing behind. I believe the object was not necessarily round but had a lighted ring on the bottom surface.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I grew up in an Air Force family and am not given to flights of fancy (pardon the pun). i also called the Indian Shores Police to see if anyone else called in a report - that is a positive. The police dispatcher said there was (not surprisingly) no report of the even by on-duty police.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I also understand that this could be a hoax of some kind, (well done) or military aircraft from nearby Tampa.

I slowed down my car, though could not come to a complete stop due to traffic.  My thought upon first glance was that it must be a cropduster plane or something and that it looked stationary because it was coming in my direction.  I discovered, though, that it wasn&#39;t moving at all--it was hovering, and did not look anything like a plane.  It had somewhat rounded top like a tradional UFO drawing, but had sides that seemed to come down at about a twenty and then seventy degree angle (rather than the disk).  I looked at it as long as I could, but then it disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Looked almost like tornado clouds swirling around,  Lightning,  wind was blowing the top layer of clouds, To the east, the under laying clouds were going towards the west.  looked very violent i noticed an object between the 2 layers of clouds traveling slowly, it had a kind of bluish hue to it. mostly white in the center. it was round almost like a ballon.. At first thats what we thought it may be..  but it was traveling south east..  the clouds were  east and west.  it seemed to be moving at the same elevation. did not change directions. It seemed to slow twice almost stopping.  but then continued.   My Brother in law came out of the house to watch it with us.   He had never seen anything like that either.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I failed to mention earlier that it was my nephew and i that was first looking at it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> after about 5 minutes  it vanished into a very thick cloud bank.  My brother inlaw said that he had seen something like that before but couldn&#39;t remember exactly when or where.   I have also see something like it in the past over the town i live in..   but just thought it was maybe a weather balloon,   it was hard to say how high it was.  but it was between the 2 layers of clouds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> so i figure it must have been at least 2000 ft,  and if i put my thumb up against it..it would just cover it..if thats anykind of an indication.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Well thanks for listening  and hope maybe some day the gov. will tell us what some of these things are.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thanks,<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((name deleted))<n>

I was told that some  other people from the North end of town seen the same thing I did and they also thought it was a flock of birds and they seen it vanish too.And there was no noise or sound at all.

We saw a cloud that was bright in color and a suddenly a very bright white colored light much about ½ the size of the cloud came from behind the cloud and shined for sometime and again disappeared in 4 minutes.  My mother-in-law and my wife also saw this.  I could not believe my eyes and called my friend and his wife to watch what I was observing and I explained to them what I saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then again in a minute or so the same thing happened and I saw a saucer like object about the size of aircraft that had blinking lights that moved toward the cloud and again the same kind of bright light came for about 4 mins and then slowly disappread.  During this time we also saw about 4 clouds, I guess that were illuminated with that bright light.  I called 911 regarding this and they asked me to report to local police. This was a dramatic event in my life.<n>

I was facing approximately SE and my brother was NE toward me.  A bright white light, coming from the north, first caught my attention out of my peripheral vision as it passed by, approximately straight out over the lake, or at about 12 o&#39;clock.  It was at maybe 40 degrees above the horizon, or two to three times the height of the hills across the lake.  Initially I thought it was a meteor, as I saw two successive flashes, as sometimes meteors will do if they break up of “pop”.<n> <n><n> <n><n> But then, as the light proceeded south at roughly the speed of a fast moving shooting star, it continued to pulse in a very constant and rhythmic manner: pulse-pulse...pause...pulse-pulse...pause...pulse-pulse, etc.  I called it to my brothers attention and finally got him to turn around and look to the south just in time to see it (thank you!).<n> <n><n> <n><n> Total time of incident was about 10 seconds, and maybe 6-8 two-pulse sets.  The object went from about a 12 o&#39;clock position to just above the southern horizon in that time.  There was no sound heard during or after.  Object appeared to be moving in a straight line; however, just before disappearing it seemed to wander some, erratically and laterally.  Upon thinking about this a bit, it seems likely that this apparent lateral movement was most likely a visual effect of now looking at the fast receding object straight from behind, and that its path was not perfectly straight.  The lateral movement was only a degree or two at most.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have been a practicing geologist of 30 years and my brother is a university professional.  In all my years of star gazing, I have never seen anything of this nature.  In my mind this was clearly not any type of natural phenomenon.  Impossible to be a satellite by nature of its extreme speed.  It left no visible ionized trail as a meteor does and the rhythmic pulsing was dead constant like a strobe.  Would it be possible for a meteor to skip across the outer atmosphere, like a skipping stone on a pond and cause the observed effect?  I think that the rhythmic pattern of flashes eliminates this possibility and it went too far and for too long.  I have no ready and reasonable explanation what we saw.<n>

It got brighter and brighter and brighter and I thought I was possible seeing a nova. It was exciting but then upseting at the same time. About five seconds in it started fading and faded fast like it was dying. It didn&#39;t seem to move, it just went out. Strange to say the least. It was not in the atmosphere, it was among the stars.

At the same time the neon light was not even (about 2/3 of its volume was constant and did not change, however, the remaining 1/3 throbbed). It was like a pulsing reflection inside its surface.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The angular size of the body was equal to the size of a helicopter observed from a distance of 800 meters, as if it cabin is see-through and filled with soft neon light inside,I thought so the first 3-4 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The sun had set so the flying object was easy to distinguish on the brown yellow haze above the sunset sun. Subconsciously I was looking for a wing or a screw at the back of it but there was nothing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object was lowering slowly and I thought it would cross the line of the horizon so that it would see in front of the hills which are 15-20 kilometers away from where I was, and if this had happened I would have been able to approximate the distance between me and the object but this did not occur.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Visibility was very high, there was no dust or smoke. I could clearly see the ridge of the mountain 50 km south from here. On that day the atmosphere was crystal clear after the rain from the previous day.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The projection of the object’s trajectory made it look like it was going to lower enough for me to see the mountains behind it, but this never happened. It disappeared, with a small slur before that. Right before it disappeared I knew this was about to happen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As soon as I could not see it any longer I went upstairs to get a better view but the object had long gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I also thought possible of the disc making a horizontal circle and me seeing the trajectory that was closest to me because before it disappeared, its light became a little dim.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It is also possible that the object is very far – its speed was like a meteorite’s. Noiseless, quiet and very quick, but it flew almost horizontally above the set sun (with a small lowering to the South). However, it had nothing to do with a meteorite because the disc was very volumetric filled with soft bluish light with angular size of about ¼ or 1/5 of rising or setting full moon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Actually, the terrain of the mountain hills was the same – going lower from South to the North so it is possible that the object was following the terrain of the hills.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am describing everything that I had in my mind for these few seconds and I compared it to things that I have seen before like helicopters or meteorites but I know it was neither of those.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The place where I was standing has coordinates S 43.09605 degrees, E 2566973 degrees which is East from the city of Veliko Tarnovo. The object was on the West from my location and was flying from the South towards the North.<n> <n><n> <n><n> For the 7-10 seconds that I saw this object moving, it had travelled 5-10 angular degrees.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I directed Skyscout towards the point of the trajectory of the object and it displayed SAO141665 and HIP 85365.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After 2 days of reflecting, I now think that it is more possible that the sunset played a role, i.e. the object reflected the sunlight for a few seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The question is what this big object is.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Maybe it was a USA bomber B1, (which is a disc) but I have never seen those in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> If it was a B1, then many people would know that.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

One disappeared behind a hotel in the distance but the other kept ascending and then did a very quick and extremely tight 360 while acending.  Nothing we have ever seen before.  very, very, very visible/clear.  after the 360 it continued to ascend what looked to be straight up and then flew east not straight over us but to the north at a high rate of speed.

It was between the size of a star and the moon from our vantage point.  The object floated gently from left to right, stopped, and within seconds faded out to nothing, as if it were to have shot off into space directly away from earth.  I tend to look up at the sky and find the unusual, the only problem is that almost everything I have seen can be explained fairly easily.  This...I have no clue.

None had a jet stream behind them. The first object was moving west at a very high altitude. We watched it till it dissapeared farther into the west, then another object that looked like the same one reappeared quite aways behind and to the side of where that had dissapeared. Almost like it had jumped a far distance behind where we saw the first object dissapear at. That one soon was out of sight. It was probably 10-15 minutes after seeing that, and 2 objects appeared almost side by side, no jetstream, both were shiny, had seemed to appear out of nowhere and began moving further away from each other. One headed south and the other moved westward. There was no sound, no jetstream,they seemed to just pop up in sight out of nowhere and I couldn&#39;t tell you the exact speed, but they were moving pretty fast. I thought I noticed one speeding up at a good rate and another that just was kind of floating forward for a few seconds or so. I really wanted to try and notice altitude and speed change variation but it was really hard to tell. Both objects were extremely shiny bright. Metallic I would say. And, I don&#39;t see it everyday but every so often I&#39;ll notice something like this in the skies in my area. Interesting skies down here.

Still watching the object I continued driving South through the intersection and into the Chapters parking lot. I stood there for about five minutes, watching this thing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It seemed to be a long dark tube about 15 to 20 feet long. It would slowly twist, turn and bend. Sometimes floating upward or downward.  At one point it was bent like a right angle, with the bend part pointing upward.  The ends of this tube object were blunt not pointy.  It acted like a giant slow moving snake.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There were three people in a parked car close by, so I showed them the object. They were also amazed.  After watching it for a few more minutes, we all decided to get in our cars and try to follow the object for a closer look.

The Phoenix Arizona sky was very clear with a few clouds. I noticed what I thought was a huge bird at first. But, then decided it was too big for a bird. I ran in and got my camera and clicked a few pictures. It was moving slowly at first and then climbed out of sight.  I am not sure if it was balloons or not. I know last night other people had reported seeing ufo-like or unusual things in the sky. (I did not hear of this until this am). Thanks<n>

He had said that the entire house was filled with a orange/reddish color light.  He had said that there was no noise to the odd lights, just looked like it was a search or beam type light.I had told my father that there has been several reports of ufo activity in our town since the 90&#39;s.But of course,we were not living here at those times.Just stories I had been told by the locals.Whatever he saw,fits to the &#34;T&#34; of what has been seen here.One report I had heard of was a low flying Triangle that had been spoted back in 2003,just down the street from where we live.That is why this sighting my father had luck of seeing,just might be something going on here in Palm Coast.Whatever it was,I am going to catch a it with my own two eyes tonight.....wish me luck....Thanks.<n>

I wanted to take video of it to compare to my last sighting of a triangular object so I began to film it with my SONY HI8 Handi Cam model CCD-TRV65.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This object had the identical light pattern as before. 3 dim white lights, one on each &#39;tip&#39; and a pulsing white light and a pulsing red light. There is one significant difference between this sighting and the others. This time I heard what sounded like jet engines.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This object flew at the same slow pace across the sky from West to East as the last one.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have about 3 minutes of video of this sighting and the weird thing is that once it moved closer to the Eastern Horizon it seemed to &#39;hover&#39; because there was a point where the lights should have been disappearing but they didn&#39;t.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I dont know how to transfer HI8 video to a PC but I will upload the video ASAP.<n>

The flashing happened two more times, approximately a minute apart.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then, we seen this shape, too high up to make out actual shape, zip across the sky.  Thought it was a satellite at first, but then it started wobbling, and going back and forth really quick.  It stopped, dead stop, and sat for a second, then poof disappeared.<n>

With the naked eye, they appeared to be single lights. Each night, they were accompanied by orange lights which lasted about 10secs. Tonight, I timed the light, (just over the distant horizon), at 82 seconds. The orange light did not move and appeared to hover in one spot. I was on the phone with my sister when the orange light appeared and stayed. She said the phone was breaking up on her end. It stopped when the orange light disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.  PD))<n>

6/11/09 20:00|Tempe|AZ|Sphere|20 minutes|Bright white light in the Phoenix evening sky.|8/5/09|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/070/S70457.html|270|ndxe200906| Bright white light in the Phoenix evening sky<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was driving through Phoenix at about 20:00 June 11th, 2009.  Immediately after heading Westbound, I saw a very large sphere in the sky, that was emanating a bright white light.  It was maybe 20 degrees above the horizon, in the West-Northwest direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I pulled over onto a neighborhood street to watch the object and get on the phone!  I called my dad in Tempe, he had seen it in the sky about 15 minutes earlier and was watching it.  I called my mom, and after she spotted it, she grabbed the neighbors and they all watched it.  I called another friend, she and her boyfriend plus entourage all watched it while on the phone with me.  Witnesses are not a problem!  I watched the object for about 15 minutes before it disappeared.  It was far too large and bright to be a star or a planet, and it was completely motionless.  I was parked, and by comparing it to other stationary objects, houses, poles, etc, it didn’t drift or anything.  The white light was very bright, creating a sort of aura of light around it that was maybe double or triple the circumference of the central object.  In the center, it was looked like just a solid sphere of light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After perhaps 15 minutes of watching the object, it suddenly began to look like it was moving away from my point of view.  It appeared to be moving slightly, and the white aura of light faded rapidly.  It became a bright orange color, like the color of Mars, and it’s size continued to diminish quickly.  Within about one minute, it was nothing more than a small point of light, now much like a star, and then it disappeared from sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I went out into the yard to look around to see if I could spot any stars at that time. I didn&#39;t see a single one.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I went into the house, brought out my 7&#34; (dia) telescope and tried out various lenses. By this time the cone had gradually lowered in elevation, had maintained its brilliance, and moved slightly further south from where I&#39;d seen it (total elapsed time about 5 minutes).<n> <n><n> <n><n> It stayed in our range for about 45 minutes or so. Toward the end of its visibility, it quickly diminished in light intensity, to the point where it appeared to be a faint star. We then lost sight of it behind a tree, and I had a hard time tracking it due to its dimming.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The light itself appeared cone shaped. The upper left corner appeared a bit rounded, the upper right corner was more squared. The light color itself I&#39;d have to describe as what you&#39;d see when looking at a fluorescent bulb; nearly a pure white. When looking through my Galileo telescope, directly below the bottom of the cone I saw a very small point of light. Unfortunately, because I had to rely on telescopes to spot the object, I was unable to get a photo of it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was plenty of air traffic around, but I saw/heard zero fast-movers, and having seen flares fired from both helos and fighters, I can absolutely confirm this was no flare.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My younger brother flies AH-64D&#39;s in Mirana. When returning to base tonight he heard several aircraft communicating with Williams Gateway tower explaining what they&#39;d seen, and the word &#34;balloon&#34; was mentioned. Again, I&#39;ve seen many balloons, to include both weather and hot-air, and this looked nothing like either of them.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I use a pair of binoculars to see that it was actually spherical...sort of shaped like a hot air balloon, but not nearly that exact in shape. It was extremely bright even in the setting sunlight. There were scattered high clouds, likely 30 to 40 thousands feet high and this object was behind them at times. While the clouds were moving briskly towards the NE this blob-like light was slowly drifting westward. After about 15 minutes it dimmed somewhat and (again through binoculars) then tiny little lights, almost like embers started appearing below the blob. Each one only lasted for 4 to 10 seconds. These lights seemed to &#34;fall&#34; from the blob, but some moved laterally...they were very small, but a couple seemed to move upward briefly, before dimming out.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I continued to watch as this bright blob for almost 45 minutes as it slowly drifted west and dimmed to a pale blue color as the dusk became night time. Only after a deck of clouds obscured it, did I give up the watch.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have to imagine thousands of people in central and west central Arizona saw this thing. Again, it had to be very large, because it was above the high clouds and at a very low angle for me. At it&#39;s brightest period it was not homogenous, it seemed to have some motling (sp?)some variance in it&#39;s brightness or on its surface.<n> <n><n> <n><n> If it was some huge balloon. I don&#39;t understand why it was so bright and more importantly, how the heck it was going west when the upper air flow was out of the southwest.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I did take video of this object, but my zoom wasn&#39;t great enough to reveal any shape.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Possible high-altitude balloon.

There was no noise and the sky had patchy thin cloud.  As the light passed over the house I guessed it to be not as high as general planes Ive seen and it did not have any flashing lights it just moved silently with a slight pulse another appeared identicle to the first.  Same height same color.  The second was heading in the same direction, about 1000 yards behind.  I then ran through the house called to my family what I thought I was seeing everyone followed me upstairs and we all looked out of the front bedroom windows. By this time the first had gone and the second was fading. I then went down stairs and back into the rear garden and saw a third object/light.  I called everyone to the garden and we all stood together and watched it move accross the sky.  Our dogs where very excited and began barking and running around.  Possibly becau! se we had all ran upstairs and down again.  I didin&#39;t get my camera and now I&#39;m really regretting not doing so.  Their where not flares /planes/police helicoptors.  The direction was from south to northeast.  As there seem to just appear from nowhere Im guessing maybe it was the thin clouds that gave that impression.  Not sure if they did just appear or broke through cloud.  The whole time of this sighting was no more then  2 minutes.Non of us have seen anything like this before.It was very strange.  I have now got my vid next to the back door.you never know i might catch something on film.  I intent to check local press on Monday see if anyone else saw them.

It had very bright flickering lights that caught my eye. At first sight I assumed airplane and didn&#39;t even really flinch. But after a few moments I didn&#39;t hear anything and the lights were definitely flickering not like a planes would and not in a real definable manner, as if they were randomly placed and had the appearance of making this a very large object. There were 3 white lights on the &#39;tips&#39; a flashing red light and a flashing white light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I turned on my video camera, Sony HI8 Handy Cam model CCD-TRV65.

That day, we decided to follow a route via US 380 West towards the town of SOCORRO, searching for any available lodging on route. After securing a room at a local motel in the town of CAPITAN, we decided to go for a ride later on after dinner and check out the stars that night by the desert. We had experienced some overcast weather earlier in the day and the skies had turned clear enough to do so by evening. Somewhere around 8:00 pm we found NM State 234 on our GPS, and we decided to head for awhile on this road eastbound (and towards ROSWELL in Lincoln County).<n> <n><n> <n><n> NM STATE 230 is a 2 way road which appeareed to be mostly used by local traffic during the day and not a very busy road at all in the night. There are no light poles to illuminate the way once you&#39;ve entered the desert and sometime after dusk (between 8:45 PM and 9:10 PM) the night fell quickly, and eeringly dark. I engaged my vehicle&#39;s high beam lights in order to better see the road, road markers &amp; reflectors, and also had to slow down sufficiently enough below the posted speed limits (45 &amp; 50) in order to also avoid hitting any of the abundant indigenous wild life we encountered through out most of our entire trip that night. In the 2.5 hour ride we&#39;d traveled on this road, no other vehicles were encountered in either direction (nor could any be seen at a far distance in the mostly flat landscape).<n> <n><n> <n><n> Sometime around 9:00 PM we reached an area somewhere in between mile markers 41 &amp; 42 on STATE 230, at which point we decided not to continue any further in that direction. After doing a U-turn to head back westbound, I parked the car just on the shoulder of the road at mile marker 41. I turned off the engine, radio and lights, and sat we sat inside the car talking with my friend in total darkness &amp; silence. We commented on how dark it had gotten on that crisp, clear and moonless night (up to that point...the moon rose up later on around 10:05 or so). Our plan qas to get our vision aclimated to the dark, and then get out of the car and look up at the constellations.<n> <n><n> <n><n> However, before we even got a chance to set a foot outside on the ground. At approximately 9:10 PM (and with barely a hint of western dusk light left on the horizon...the eastern skies were already dark &amp; starry!), we both noticed an object about the size of a bayer aspirin traveling hurridly miles above in the skies. We couldn&#39;t make out it&#39;s shape or outline at all, as it had a very bright and steady glowing orange to reddish light. At first, I  thought it may have been either a lear jet, or military aircraft traveling typically in a straight path, with a north-east to east bound trajectory heading, at a 30 degree angle above both the barely visible horizon, and the distant western mountain range beyond.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am well familiar with many aircrafts used by our military, having served in both the: USMC &amp; the USCG.  So it seemed something rather odd that this craft was traveling that at night with no other type of fuselage lights &#34;ON&#34;, nor did it produce any familiar distant sounds, like those from a jet or rotor engines.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was just about to calmy say something to my friend, when at that very same moment he bursted out saying: &#34;What is that in the sky?&#34;...&#34;do you see it?&#34; No sooner did he asked... when suddenly the object disappeared,  vanishing in what we&#39;d estimated to be 5-6 seconds. Then, suddenly it re-appeared again further along on the same path, at what seemed tome to be 2-3 clicks east of it&#39;s last position. Suddenly, the object cleanly splits into 2 (two) objects (each retaining its original orangish-reddish color light), both objects then travelled parallel to the other at first. Quickly separating or widening apart in a sort of an arc fashion, then suddenly both objects did something bizzare: each dove right into each other, rejoining and giving the appearance as if both lights had &#34;MELTED&#34; or morphed back into 1(one)single object---immediatelly after completing this &#34;maneuver&#34;, it completely &#34;vanished&#34; into thin air and it did not reappear again anywhere in the skies.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was absolutely no sound or echo indicating an explosion or collision, there were no visible trails, or &#34;hot&#34; sparks/debris falling anywhere on the ground landscape, nor could we see any surface fire coming out of the desert landscape below at that distance thereafter, which would&#39;ve indicated any sort of accident happening in the skies and over that part of the desert.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My friend and I sat there for about 5-10 minutes both, perplexed and excited at what we&#39;d seen. We asked ourselves a number of questions in an attempt to make sense of what we&#39;d witnessed  (i.e.: was it fireworks?...was it a satellite?...could it have been spotlights...missiles?) but, we couldn&#39;t arrive at a rational answer on what we saw that night. The entire episode lasted approximately 30 seconds and although I had a digital camera with me, unfortunately I could not retrieve it out of it&#39;s case, and power it up quickly enough to capture the event in the limited time as it happened. Afterwards, we started the engine, and quickly got back on the road back to our motel.<n>

It was as if the Orb had swept away the chemtrails the would have fallen  in the area where I live.I am standing on one side of my car port (covered patio) and my telescope is on the other side of the patio. So I think to myself &#34;Ok I am going to go in the house&#34; but purposly walk over to my telescope. I look up and the UFO is still there. I put my hand on the telescope non-chalantly while looking up at the UFO, and sure enough, Up UP UP and away it goes out of my sight. Of course I have to laugh!

It appeared to be shaped like an inverted triangle.  It was far brighter than anything else in the sky and was visible while it was still light out.<n>

After another 15-20 seconds of invisibility, it slowly increased brightness until it was easily visible again with the sun shining bright and still plenty high in the sky (more than three hours before sunset).<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was far too high in the sky to make out a shape. There was no apparent color (just white light). It moved approximately twice the distance of pinky to thumb spread as far apart as possible on an outstretched arm in the duration of our observation - approximately 15-20 minutes. This distance was somewhat consistent with the movement of some light clouds at high altitude in the jetstream, although it moved slightly slower than the clouds. The cloud cover was very minimal (less than 5% of sky).<n> <n><n> <n><n> Location in the sky was due north, very close to the location of the North Star, moving from east to west.<n>

I was looking east to the clouds starting to creep out of the mountains toward the lowlands. As I was looking at the clouds, I briefly the scanned the blue sky above them and noticed a bright object about 45 degrees up due east of where I was standing. The object seemed to change in brightness and had slight movement in its seeminly fixed position but I wasn’t sure if that was just a trick of the eyes. I proceeded to watch the object for any movement for about 10 minutes and noticed that it had slowly moved southward during that time. My neck was getting sore from staring at it so long so I went into my house to grab a towel so I could watch it from a grassy slope nearby. When I came out, I spotted the object again at about 80 degrees so it had moved westward. My stepson and neighborfriend arrived and I pointed it out to the both of them. When the neighbor’s father came out, I acknowledged him and told him what we were looking at but when I looked back up to find the object again, I was unable to locate it. I watched it for about 15 minutes but it appeared to be at a good enough distance to only be a bright dot in the blue sky. The skies were clear except for the clouds that were over the mountains and the temperature was in the mid 70s. The area it appeared above was Mount Lake Terrace. While it was fairly distant and hard to relocate when you took your eye off of it, I doubted anyone else would have seen it or reported but am curious if there are other reports of an object in that area yesterday.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Although I do know for certain that it occurred in the summer of 2009. The following is absolute fact, and has convinced me that we are not alone in the universe.<n> <n><n> <n><n> While driving westbound on Illinois Route 148 from Mt. Vernon, Illinois; about two miles before reaching Waltonville, an inner voice spoke to me. “Look up if you want to see us,” crossed my mind. An unseen female voice was speaking within my male body, and seemed to not be coming from my own mind. I immediately leaned over the steering wheel, looking upward through the windshield. Seeing nothing unusual I thought to myself,”I don’t see anything.” Immediately a response came from that internal female voice,”Keep looking.” I again focused harder on the same area of sky and I could barely make out a large grouping of silver, circular shaped objects flying at high altitude.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Upon seeing the objects I pulled the vehicle over to the shoulder of the highway, in order to more safely view the objects. I would estimate the objects’ altitude at approximately 40,000 feet. The altitude was of the height that if it were any greater, the objects would have been undetectable by the naked eye. They seemed to be flying in a group; some coming together into small groupings and flying around each other. I watched for a minute or so and they drifted out of view. What I saw could not have been balloons, because balloons don’t speak to people telepathically.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Here is a video link I found on youtube, which was filmed in Mexico, this is EXACTLY what I saw while driving in Southern Illinois. Although an exact representation of what I witnessed, it is not a video of my sighting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xCX_WoD3NfE<n>

An object(triangle)w/3 lights flying just over a very thin cloud cover going the opposite way towards north. The object was fast,silent and very low.

The sky was fairly overcast at the time of sighting and the object appear in front of very thick clouds indicating it was not any form of celestial body.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object was completely stationary for a short period of time but started moving West.  The movement was slow and first then the object proceeded to accelerate  and slow again somewhat sporadically.  The movement was unlike any aircraft I&#39;ve seen.  The movement was not perceived based on the movement of clouds; I was tracking it solely based on it&#39;s position relative to the moon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After moving for approximately thirty seconds to one minute it stopped again and was completely stationary.  As soon as it stopped, I went inside to get my phone and look up the number for the hotline.  I place the call less than two minutes later and it was still visible and still stationary.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object was perceived to be at the same altitude as the clouds as it would disappear under very heavy cloud coverage although it still shone bright even in lower cloud coverage that blocked most of the light from the moon.  As heavier clouds moved by it, I saw for a split second what could have been a second object that appeared slightly further West and visually lower than the first.  I was not exposed to the second object to rule out the possibility of it being a celestial body however I do not recall seeing it in clear skies as I did the first.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It continued to move to and then suddenly changed course upwards with an alarming speed and before it went away the light ball suddenly became brighter than what it used to be and it released another light thats about half of its size, the first light ball continued to move upwards and disappeard and the second light ball that was released by the first light ball continued to move westwards until it disappeard behind the trees up the mountains. It just so happen that my parents are also looking out the window at the t! ime and saw the whole thing as well. The three of us talked in their room after the event and the three of us has the same discription. A ball of light moving, stopped in the middle, changed course upwards with unusual speed, light became brighter, the first ball of light released another ball of light about half of its size, first ball of light continued to move upwards and disappeard, Second ball of light moved westwards and disappeard behind the trees up in the mountains.<n>

They were still for about 10 seconds and then slowly moved up past a stationary star and dimmed out and disappeared.  At the same time, one of the four of us was looking in a different direction than we were and saw 3 bright stars in the formation of a triangle.  After approximately 10 seconds they all dispersed at the same time, 2 went up together and the other 1 went down.  They all dimmed at the same time and then disappeared.

Another had one BIG red light and moved VERYY fast<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was in my room watching TV, then all of a sudden, I couldn&#39;t even hear my show anymore because there was this loud, high pitched humming or whistling sound. So I run to my window and look outside... there&#39;s a huge square pattern of lights, with a flashing red one that would flash on one side, then a white one would flash in the middle. So I’m freaking out running outside and staring at it. When I look again, there&#39;s another light, moving SO fast, straight towards the square one. Just when i think they&#39;re going to hit, one moves down and the other moves up, then they continue to circle around the Fallbrook/Oceanside area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was another one that was also circling that SOUNDEDD like a helicopter, but i knew it couldn&#39;t be because of its speed. And especially as it got further away, it was moving way faster than even a jet looks like it&#39;s moving, into the same general area that the other two went to.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This happened three times. Unfortunately I couldn&#39;t find a camera in time to get a picture, but on the last round... SO FAR... i almost did but it was too far away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> But when I did research on s square air craft... there was no government air craft that was square with lights like this one had.

My first impression was that it was the white wing lights of a large plane, but it made no noise which was odd for how close the object was off the ground. It appeared to have no red or blue blinkers on it like a normal aircraft which seemed odd as well. We could not make out a silhouette of the object, just the lights. The craft proceed on a southern path before it did a light curve and headed in a southwestern direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At this two smaller white lights appeared under one of the “wings lights” and then another set appeared under the other one. Now the two sets three appeared to slightly close the gap between themselves as they continued their path and what once looked two white wing lights of one object now looked to be two object with three lights, each in a triangular formation. The objects continued to travel side by side at airplane speed until they disappeared over the trees.<n>

I was interested in the colour and the lack of flashing lights that aircraft make for the seemingly close proximity of the light.  I then saw another identical shape quite close behind it. I then saw three more in a formation behind these two.  I stopped the car on arriving home and saw  2 of them disappear behind the trees at which point I realised they were travelling quite fast.  The total length of the sighting was 30 seconds at least. I could not determine how close they were away, but judging from the speed, they appeared to be at a fairly low elevation.  What struck me was the dull glowing orange colour.  No sound was heard. The background sky was totally dark (no moonlight obvious) with no stars visible in the field of view.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

The  plane  looked  orange  from  the  sunlight  on  the  metal.    I thought  to  myself,  that  pilot  has  to  see  it  to.  there was  nothing  else  in  the  sky.	A  few  minutes  went  by,  and  	the  light  started ! to  move  up,  then  either  it  turn  its  light  off.  and  the  sunlight  was  hitting  it.   or   it  changed  color.  and  then  shot  strait  up.   i  was  wondering  if  it  would  be  on  radar.  and  can  you  find  out?<n>

I looked up to see if any stars were out, and noticed a bright light.  The light was steady, and not moving from the spot I first noticed it, and began to flash.  At first I thought it was a plane, since we have the airport nearby, but this light was simply not moving.  I don&#39;t believe it was a plane.  After about 5 seconds of flashing, the light disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Seconds later, two other lights appeared, roughly 3 finger&#39;s width apart (and to the left) from where the previous one appeared.  These two traveled slowly in formation (one in front of the other) for roughly 10 seconds.  The first one then slowly cut off it&#39;s lights, followed shortly thereafter by the one behind it.<n>

I was on the far side of his lawn when i saw an oval, meteor-like object flying through the air.  It looked rocky in formation from my perspective.  I immediately hurried to get my camera phone out.  The object had over 5 &#34;yellow&#34; lights omitting from it in a symmetrical manner.  It was flying from side to side in an erratic way.  I could not get my camera to function in time to catch record of the UFO before it sailed over the trees.  It seemed to be flying at about the altitude of a low flying plane.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is wrong.  Source cannot spell.  Probable hoax.  PD))<n>

There were yellowish white lights which outlined the entire &#34;H.&#34;   There may have also been a colored light or two, but the overwhelming impression was of the yellowish white lights.  It was silent and was moving quite smoothly, off to the northwest.   I had it in sight for 6 or 7 seconds until it moved out of the frame of my window.<n>

It caught my attention because one...it was BRIGHT! It was brighter than any light on a plane that I have ever seen.  Two, the entire object looked spherical and unlike a plane or helicopter of any kind.  Lastly, the way and direction it was traveling was odd. It was moving fairly slow, but somewhat sporadically.  It also changed direction rather quickly with no wide turns like a plane or anything like that.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Another thing that caught my attention was the direction of travel. I live somewhat close to LAX Airport and often watch the planes lined up for miles on their decent. Rarely do I see aircraft headed at a 90 degree angle towards the line of planes. It was a good deal higher than the planes on their way in for a landing and was of no threat to them. But again, I do not see aircraft flying in that direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After watching the craft for roughly a minute or two it seemed to start moving higher up and away from us. The once extremely bright sphere began to slowly fade away right before our eyes until it was completely gone!  There were no clouds in the sky at the time and no obstruction of our view.  It simply vanished into nothing.<n>

Then I saw it moveing very slowly, it was going up to the sky.  I thought it was just me seeing things but I did not stop looking at it.

They lasted only a few seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After I saw this happen at least 2 more times I took out my camera and switched to video mode in case they appeared again.

They were again 1 larger light then an arch/semi-circle of 4-5 smaller lights.  They didn&#39;t appear to pulse brighter/dimmer, they just seemed to light together then go out together.  They didn&#39;t look to me to be flares as they didn&#39;t change in elevation or go out separately, pulse as flares normally do.  The lights appeared to stay on the same elevation.   The video shows the light in the sky then go out.

It seemed to be moving irregularly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was similar to the way a plane looks when the headlights are aimed at you, but this was so high in the sky, for that to be true, the plane would have had to be descending--and it wasn’t.<n>

We see planes all of the time, so I thought that was what it was at first glance, but when I turned around, it wasn’t.  By what we could only describe as a red light, with a little white light on the bottom, was going diagonally across the sky in a north western direction (very uncommon for out weather patterns around here).  I took a picture of the light, and when we looked at it later and zoomed in, it actually looks like multiple lights in no particular pattern.  We just wanted to bring this to someone else’s attention, we thought it was awful unusual and none of the news stations caught it either.  The more I look at the picture, the more curious I am as to what we saw.  As for our UFO history, we have none.  We have seen strange things before, but never quite like this.  My husband is a firefighter and I am a stay at home mom, that does hair for friends on the side.  We have NO background as to know what this was.<n>

She pointed to the sky and asked &#34;What is that?&#34; Me and our friend looked to where she was pointing and saw a round object floating across the sky. It was flying very high, but below the cloud level.  I ran into the house and grabbed some binoculars, came back outside and focused on the object. through the binoculars, I could see the front of the object was red, the rest was either silver or white.  I pased my girlfriend the binoculars and she saw it. then she handed them to our friend who also saw it.  It seemed to be &#34;barrel-rolling&#34;.   I got the binoculars back to look at it, and it disappeared.  I scanned the sky for a few seconds before I saw it again, but it was all black.   I ran through the house to the front yard, but lost sight of it again.  When I went back to the back patio, we were asking each other &#34;What was that?&#34;  Then I pointed out 2 F-15&#39;s flying in the direction the object went.  They were followed by an F-16 and 2 more F-15&#39;s.<n>

For whatever reason I looked up at the sky and saw a dot that was gray in color against the overcast sky. It may have had angles; I couldn&#39;t really see any definition on it because of it&#39;s distance. What was strange was that it didn&#39;t move at all. Though it was quite high, it was low enough to be in front of the clouds. As I walked I kept my eye on it as best I could but, I was losing it every time I had to divert my attention. Eventually I had to stop watching it because I had errands to do. I may have the date wrong since it was some time ago, however there&#39;s another sighting similar to this in your report database.

A perfectly round, red, orb. It looked to be the size of a volleyball or a basketball so I imagine it must have been slightly larger than that given optical illusion distance creates; it just sat PERFECTLY STILL hovering there, smack dab in the middle of the road, less than 50 feet off the ground. It didn’t move or bounce or rotate. It didn’t ascend or descend at all– as you would expect of a balloon. Just sat there. Couldn’t take my eyes off of it. It was just south of Lakewood on the parkway southbound– probably about 11 AM.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Someone had pulled over to watch. Wish I could have done the same.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was dumbfounded. I remember thinking to myself, “What the hell is that” as I approached. I tried to rationalize it away– that it must have been one of the red cushions from an electrical wire– but then I don’t know if those float. I assume that, had one of those broken loose, it would fall to the ground. And even then, if it was filled with some lightweight gas to support the weight of electric lines, I would expect it to be blown about by the currents of wind created by passing traffic. It didn’t ascend or descend. It was not attached to an electrical line. It just sat there.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was a very strange experience: its existence was telling me two contradictory things: “Here I am, look at me,” but also “You’re not supposed to see me, I’m supposed to look like something you don’t notice.”  It was almost like I wasn’t supposed to notice it was there, but yet, there it was in BROAD DAYLIGHT, just sitting there seemingly watching traffic. Very strange.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was very wierd. Here were all these other people driving down the parkway, and only myself and one other person seemed to notice it at all. How? Why?  It’s not the first time. Other members of my family have seen similar things.<n>

I got a warm feeling inside when i saw the craft, as though they were here to let me know i&#39;m not alone ... WE&#39;RE NOT ALONE.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Up ahead we saw a bright orange colored light up in the sky.  Thinking it could of been some sort of plane we continued driving.  The light hovered in the sky above the road and we saw another orange bright light around the area of the other one.  We could not make out any shape due to the darkness so we decided to pull over in a bare parking lot right up the road.  The whole drive to the parking lot this light just hovered and was slowly moving.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As we pulled into the parking lot we watch this light slowly moving above us and another couple pulled into the parking lot and parked next to us.  We tried hard to make out any type of shape but the light was so bright it was like a airplane high in the sky, but there was no indication of sound and the way it hovered as if it wasnt moving.  We were talking to each other for a split second and when we looked up to continue watching it, the light took off.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

We looked at it through binoculars, but the glare was too strong, since the sun was out.  We called several neighbors to come see, but no one was around.  We also contacted the local radio station.  We have never seen anything like this.  Eventually it moved slowly across the sky until we could not see it any longer.  At one point when it was almost gone it looked as though a fighter jet flew past it.  We didn&#39;t know where our camera was,none of us wanted to leave to go find it. We just wanted to stare at it and see what it was going to do.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.  PD))<n>

We got curious and went to check it out, but as we started to walk towards it, it went below the horizon slowly, so obviously it was farther away than we originally thought.

Viewed from Elk Grove, CA. the same night News Air10 Helicopter filmed UFO sighting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is my report from start to finish as it happened.  My wife had asked me to come outside because she saw a bright light in the sky that was not moving and she wanted me to take a look at it.  When I saw the light another light appeared just below the one already in view.  Approx. 30 seconds later a third light appeared on the right side of the second light.  After about 2 minutes of them staying in the same spot, the third light started to ascending upward and positioned itself with the other two lights to create what seemed to be a perfect triangle.  The lights stayed in this position for about 1-2 minutes.  It is at this time that the third light started to ascend again above the other two lights.  Then it started to proceed towards my direction while the other two stayed in place.  I watched the UFO go directly above my head.  I could not spell out the shape.  It looked as if it was a square shape but that was because of the light formation I saw from the bottom view.  It had one bright light in what it seemed to be each of the four corners of the UFO.  The lights looked as though they were symetrical to each other.  As one UFO passed, the second light that appeared started to ascend and also moved in my direction mimicing the first UFO.  As the second one passed above me, the first light that was visible also took the same exact path as the other two.  This came to my amazement but didn&#39;t seem true until I came across a live news video clipping from Sacramento, CA.  News 10 Air Helicopter Video from the same night.  A few days later, News 10 aired an additional story about the video they aired a few days prior and it seemed to me that this was an attempt to cover up what they had captured on video that night.  They claimed that it was an air light show advertising a GRAND OPENING for BIG O TIRES IN ROSEVILLE, CA.  I thought this was strange and called BIG O TIRES IN ROSEVILLE and they informed me that the store I called had been the only one in ROSEVILLE, CA.  AND HAS BEEN OPEN F! OR ABOUT 20 YEARS.  &#34;NO NEW STORES HAVE OPENED IN THAT AREA.&#34;  I have also E-mailed American Airlights, who claims it was their air Advertisement of the BIG O TIRE GRAND OPENING.  I HAVE NOT YET HEARD BACK FROM THEM.  I WILL GIVE ANY UPDATES ON THIS STORY AS INFORMATION COMES TO ME.  THANKS.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
6/5/09 22:00|||Flash|30 mins|bright lights on ground were following along with the speed of our plane|8/30/10|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/077/S77435.html|335|ndxe200906| bright lights on ground were following along with the speed of our plane<n> <n><n> <n><n> On the night of June 5th, 2009, my daughter, boyfriend and I were flying on American Airlines from DFW to Boston.  It was a night flight, I’m not sure what time it was specifically, but a lot of passengers were sleeping.  I’m not sure  what area of the country we were flying over at the time, but my daughter observed some bright lights below, outside the plane window.<n> <n><n> <n><n> She was 10, an elementary student, at the time, sitting on the right side of the plane (if facing the front), and I was 35, a police officer, sitting on the aisle.  My boyfriend, who was in the Navy over 30 yrs, and a fire fighter for over 30 yrs, looked out the window and also saw these lights.  I leaned over her to look out the window and I too saw these bright lights below at ground level.  To me, the way I can describe it, was it appeared as if transformers on the ground were exploding, then fading…so a bright blast of light, fast, moving along with the plane.  But there were several flashing at once, and in different sizes of flash, some small and some really big, and it was on the ground, and going about the same speed as the plane, just slightly trailing behind the plane.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were probably at about 35,000 feet and about 400-500 knots, the average flying speed and height.  The night sky was clear and the moon was out.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first we thought they may be a bunch of transformers blowing up below, but there is no way that many would do that, and if they did, there wouldn’t be any other lights on in the little cities/towns we were flying over.  Then I thought maybe we’re flying over a bunch of little ponds and lakes, and it was the reflection of the moon on the water.  But then we’d pass a highway or a large lake, and you would see the lights all the way up to the highway or lake and then they would jump over to the other side, fast.   And the reflection of the moon on the water was distinctly different.  These lights wouldn’t flash over the water or highways.  When we would pass over a tree/wooded area, we could see these bright lights light up the trees.  If we passed over neighborhoods with street lights, you could see these bright lights light up th! e immediate areas where they were.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then we asked some other passengers to look, they saw what we saw.  We even had a retired air force pilot look.  He said he’s seen some strange things in his air time, but nothing like that.  No one seemed concerned, but we all kept watching.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This phenomenon occurred for about 30 minutes, that we had timed it, then just stopped.  Who knows when it started.  So, something on the ground, or just above it, was moving fast enough to keep up with a jet/passenger plane, and bright enough to light up the areas around it…and several at once.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I just wanted to know if anyone else had reported anything like this that same night.<n>

However, the sightings around here seem to be tapering off a bit as I have not had any in the months of April or May, so out of boredom from a lack of activity, I submit this report.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On the evening of June 5, 2009 at 9:00 PM, I stepped outside my house to scan the sky before retiring for the evening. The sky was extremely clear and all the stars were visible although somewhat dim due a nearly full moon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After slowly doing a 360 degree scan of the sky three times without seeing anything remarkable, I started walking toward my front door when I noticed an object lit up in the Western sky about 45 degrees above the horizon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object can best be described as appearing somewhat like a very bright planet Venus, except it was approximately four times larger. The object appeared to just appear out of nowhere in the middle of the sky as it was headed North. The object was brightly illuminated for two seconds and would then quickly dim completely out of sight for 10-15 seconds and then reappear brightly for two more seconds. This sequence was repeated three times. Each time the object traveled approximately 20 degrees across the sky before it lit back up after 10-15 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was absolutely no noise at all outside during the entire 50 seconds or so of elapsed time of this sighting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I do not believe this sighting to be a normal aircraft due to a total silence during the time of the sighting, a lack of strobes and directional markers, and the relative size would be much larger than a jetliner at cruising altitude. Also, the speed of the object would have been much faster than a conventional aircraft. I also dismiss the notion of this being a satellite, as it was much larger and brighter than any satellite I have witnessed before. Besides, I have never seen satellites turn on and off before either.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

My camera is the Canon Power shot SD790 1S 10.0 Mega Pixel. They were fighting a fire that had started in the Los Angeles Lincoln Heights area, days later I was starting to look through my footage when I was rewinding in slow motion and saw an object flash? So I went frame by frame.  An Saucer like object stopped in mid air for 1.2 frames and was gone just as quick in another shot you can see a ball shaped object come from frame left to right and what seemed to pass in front of a LA city helicopter. The only reason I&#39;m posting this is because I see on the 8th of June 2009 in Lincoln Heights someone else saw something to!  I really don&#39;t believe in UFO&#39;s but I can&#39;t ignore what I caught on my digital camera anybody else have any ideas on what this could have been?<n>
6/5/09 14:10|Victoria|TX|Light|30 min|Unexplained objects in broad daylight over Victoria, TX.|6/9/09|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/070/S70375.html|339|ndxe200906| Unexplained objects in broad daylight over Victoria, TX.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On the afternoon of June 5, 2009, my wife, daughter, son and I witnessed some unexplainable activity in the sky above Victoria, TX.  We were swimming in the pool at my mom and dad’s house when I noticed what we first thought looked like a balloon lifting across the sky at a distance to the north -northeast.  I watched the object track across the sky for a couple of minutes, and then noticed a second object, and then a third tracking behind the first object on a similar trajectory.  I was ready to dismiss them as released balloons of some sort until all three of the objects began to flash and then switched directions and began circling back toward the direction they came from.  It was then that I became very interested in what we were witnessing.  The objects were barely visible against the blue sky, but were much easier to see with my polarized sunglasses.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My son and my daughter were able to see the objects with their naked eye.  My wife had to put on my sunglasses to see them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The objects were joined by two others and they began to rotate in a circular pattern.  It was then that I noticed another object that appeared fixed in the sky at a higher altitude and these objects appeared to be rotating in a pattern beneath the stationary object.  As I was watching this happen, I noticed what appeared to be two military jets at extremely high altitude circling the area in a much wider pattern.  It then occurred to me that maybe they were looking for these objects.  My wife suggested that maybe it was some sort of training exercise.  When the jets turned back to the northeast, all of the circulating flashing objects began to disappear one-by-one.  The stationary object remained and I watched it stay in this same position for at least another 10 minutes.  The object then began to drift slowly to the east – southeast and looked like it was also getting farther away as it became much harder to see.  The object then stopped and remained stationary As I continued watching the object, I saw the two military jets again.  They were travelling on the same flight path, but were much farther apart than before.  They followed a similar path as they had earlier but appeared to be much higher and slower.  I then spotted a third jet that was on a different path and appeared to be heading more in the direction of the stationary object. .  I sent my wife out to my truck to get my digital camera so I could attempt to get some shots of the object before it moved out of sight.  I took several pictures, but it was impossible to see the object in the screen on the camera.  The stationary object then began to move very slowly and then vanished from sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> By this time I was pretty worked up and was scanning the sky for more activity.  I was about to give up when just over the roof of the house, again to the north-northeast , I saw two more objects moving across the sky.  One was flashing, and one was solid.  The flashing one disappeared rather quickly, so I continued to watch the solid one.  It moved across the sky in a similar manner to the previous one.  I tried taking several more pictures, and then I watched it until I could no longer see it, which was probably about 5 minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The only way I can describe what we saw is that the solid objects looked similar to what a satellite would look like moving across the night sky (except for the stopping and changing directions) and the flashing objects looked like what something flat and reflective spinning in the wind would look like as it reflected the sun.  I am truly amazed and mystified.  I wish there was a way I could find out where the jets came from and what they were doing there.   I feel very strongly that they were looking at the same thing I was.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am going to download the photos from my camera as soon as I finish this and see if there is anything there.  I will send photos if they come out.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

6/4/09 22:30|Chattanooga|TN|Light|10 minutes|Silent blue light and motionless white light seen in sky over Chattanooga|8/5/09|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/070/S70537.html|343|ndxe200906| Silent blue light and motionless white light seen in sky over Chattanooga<n> <n><n> <n><n> Two neighbors and I were sitting on the porch enjoying the cool night breeze. We were all talking when I noticed a bright white light in the sky straight ahead of my line of sight (in the direction of the Tennessee River). At first I dismissed it as a helicopter. In that general direction is Erlanger Medical and the Life Force helicopter is not an unusual occurrence. I watched this for a few minutes without comment. Then a second, much brighter round blue light approached slowly from further away to come close to the stationary white light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I said “what is that?” My neighbors stopped talking and turned around to look up at the two lights. We were all on our feet at this point, talking about how strange the blue light was. It moved like a slow helicopter with an atypical light, yet it was totally silent. The helicopters that fly around this area are never silent. Also, there wasn’t any traffic that night. It was quiet out and we couldn’t hear engine sounds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The white light winked out after six or seven minutes and the blue light flew away in the direction of North Chattanooga until it was gone. Roughly a minute later it flew back in our direction, performing a few maneuvers. I made an offhand comment that if anything ‘came out’ of the light we should all hightail it indoors and lay low. The blue light headed off again across the river until it was out of sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I’m not sure what to make of this sighting. We have helicopters, a major airport in Brainerd, and the Riverbend Festival was still going on at Ross’s Landing. Nothing matches what we saw. The light was too back and forth to be a plane and too quiet to be a helicopter. And nothing at Riverbend is an airborne attraction. What is most profound to me, and my neighbors as well, was the eerie quality of that blue light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

When my son look up and saw a star moving south to north at a fast pace,my son call me to see but when I got there to see it,I could not see it so waited.  Then my son saw the star moving again, but this time I saw it moving south to north sometimes stopping or moving slow or fade out of human sight thats when I got my night scope to keep the UFO&#39;s in sight, but even using the night scope after a while the UFO would fade from sight this went on for a hour.  I saw a small twinkle in the star field thats when I raise my night vison scope to my eyes and saw a triangle formation of stars moving north to east then it fade away first by human eye sight then we use the night scope,to follow it&#39;s movement,but after a while the triangle formation faded.  Then we saw more stars moving south to north in a eratic across the night sky for about a half hour.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was mostly cloudy and I saw about 18 small white lights appear.  I thought they were balloons or papers flying high in the sky and being illuminated by the city lights.  As I observed I noticed the lights moving in and out of the clouds. I came the conclusion that they were much higher up about 13,000 feet.  They were not aircraft with blinking lights, these were brilliant white lights that lit up at the same place in the sky as they were traveling east and then they disappeared into the clouds again.<n>

When I say a Fleet I am talking 12 to 15, I lost count!!!  They where still coming.  Some are up in the sky above cloud level over my house.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am not sure what is going on, however I do know that ALOT of people are starting to really look up and take note of what is up in our skies.<n>

It was a cigar shaped craft about the size of a Cessna or leer jet.  It was following the same trajectory that a normal plane would make on approach to landing, however it was not descending.  The object traveled from my left (the west) to my right (the east).  It was a very slow moving object and I watched it for about 1 minute.  The object then turned 90 degrees away from me and traveled south.  When it turned it was like I was looking at the back end of it so it was now circular in shape and had no wings.  The object then seemed to vanish.  It did not speed off, it just kind of de-materialized.  It was almost as if it had gone behind a cloud however the sky was extremely clear and there was no haze present at all.  When I got to a high interchange I looked at downtown San Antonio just to see if there was any sort of haze and there was none.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

So this report is complete and includes all 5 sightings***  11:25 PM PST (2 Objects) Hayden Idaho  Two shooting star like objects appeared approximately 60 degrees above the West by NorthWest horizon. The two objects were exactly parallel to one another flying at a declining angle toward the east and about a pencil length apart. They began to bank North and as they descended and changed their course the objects morphed into these glowing iridescent reddish, orange, pinkish boomerang like craft. They disappeared to the NorthEast.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My girlfriend missed these as she was viewing another part of the sky and could not orient on these objects because they were moving very fast.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 11:43 (2 Objects)  Two more boomerang like objects appeared over the Western horizon flying East by North East at a constant altitude. These 2 craft flew right over us and were much closer together than the previous 2. As they flew over us they split apart and came back together as if they were going around something so as to trace a sort of vase in the sky. When they came back together they were in the East and immediately banked to the North and disappeared out of sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We both witnessed this event and were blown away trying to figure out what it could have been.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 11:50 (6 Objects)  As we were glued to the skies SIX more of these craft appeared directly above us. We did not see them fly in from any direction, they just sort of appeared. They were in a very tight single file formation and flying a snake like pattern through the sky. They moved from directly above us to the eastern sky before what appeared to be collapsing onto one another and disappearing to the North.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Again, we both witnessed this and were in total shock. We ran through the house tearing it apart looking for cameras blankets phones etc.<n> <n><n> <n><n> No other event took place and by 1 am my girlfriend went to bed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I stayed up.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 2:15 AM PST June 4th (9 Objects)  NINE more of these craft popped into my view in a triangle shape formation. They were flying from due South to due North about 30 degrees from my horizon. This was an amazing sight. The formation was very tight and the craft on the inside appeared to have this sort of electric glow to them and they appeared to be fluttering or wavering inside of this formation. They disappeared to the North.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was complacent by now and left my camera by the coffee pot.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Approx 3AM (1 Object)  After the last sighting I vowed never to be without a camera again and began to make a record of what I saw. While I was describing the previous events I pointed the camera to the sky and I saw ONE more object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This object appeared to be flying much higher than the previous ones. It was darker and broader shaped and flying slower. It was about 70 degrees above the horizon and flew from due South to due North. I was in shock and praying that the camera would pick up the image, unfortunately nothing showed up.<n> <n><n> <n><n> SHAPE AND DETAILED DESCRIPTION:  The first time I saw these and my girlfriend didn&#39;t I explained it to here as watching headlights in the sky point directly at you and then change course. I described the crafts as pinkish rose and glowing with a misty aura, angelic like. They appeared to have bird like qualities.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After the next sighting I had a very clear impression of these crafts.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They were a near perfect half moon shape with a protruding nose... there is a crop circle image that is amazingly identical to the shape of what we saw.  The link is here:  http://www.luisprada.com/Protected/IMAGES/cropcircle_walkershill1.jpg  They appeared to be glowing like the moon, sort of translucent and undefinable, but the colors red, orange and tan kept coming to our minds but there was definitely a mist or aura to them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As far as altitude goes, it is very difficult to say as there was nothing to reference.  My best guess is that they were flying much higher than a commercial airliner and traveling 10x as fast.<n>

The 2 objects shot through the sky in parallel about a pencil length apart and appeared simply as flying dots of light in the sky no bigger than a large star before changing shape into a sort of bird like object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There is a crop circle formation that bears a striking resemblance to the shape of what we saw at the following website:  http://shrey27.wordpress.com/2008/05/24/crop-circles-art-on-crop-fields/crop-circles-014/  During the transition of shape the color began to look more like a glowing tan or yellow hazy, misty color  They were so synchronized in their movements and transitions that I wondered if one wasnt a reflection of the other.<n> <n><n> <n><n> From my location they originated at a nearly 60 degree + angle and towards the NorthWest.  They moved in a sort of elongated V or sharp hook pattern and disappeared to the NorthEast.  They appeared to get larger until they were finally out of sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> All in all this sighting lasted maybe 5 or 6 seconds and was fast enough that my girlfriend completely missed it as she was staring a different direction and couldn&#39;t catch the glimpse.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My reaction was literally &#34;WHAT THE FUCK WAS THAT! Seriously, what the fuck was that? What was that...&#34; I stood there in shook as I was dumbfounded how my girlfriend could have missed something that obvious.<n> <n><n> <n><n> While she watched the sky I ran inside to see what time it was and my PC said 11:28.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So we stared at the sky thinking about how great it would be if we could both see it together and after about 15 minutes something appeared again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This time we both saw it.  2 &#34;dove&#34; shaped objects flying from the NorthWest toward the SouthWest.  These 2 objects were much closer together, approximately the length of an eraser tip on a pencil, and flew in a very strange pattern:  First they were side by side, then the synchronistically flew away from each other and back toward each other as if to draw out a vase sort of shape in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Before flying out of sight I could see them veer a sharp &#34;left&#34; as if they were right on top of each other and I was able to follow these for a much greater distance than the previous sighting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My girlfriend and I were absolutely amazed and talked about how these objects had a very strange &#34;bird like&#34; appearance and almost glowed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I ran inside immediately after I lost sight of them to check the time and it was 11:43.  I grabbed a pen and paper and recorded a couple notes and the time and went back to watching the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 7 minutes later at 11:50 we witnessed a mass formation of 5 to 6 objects flying in single file order but making snake like movements across the sky while maintaining a very tight, smooth, formation.  This was by far the most exciting and heart racing sighting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> These objects seemed to appear out of no where and were spotted slightly lower in the sky than the previous 2 sightings.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Last week I filed a UFO sighting with MUFON because I spotted a very similar object but it was much darker, more like a silhouette and not nearly as clearly defined and illuminated as these objects were.<n>

This one is not as bright, maybe because it was not as close this time as the one I seen on the 31st. I might as that on the 31st I felt a very positive, exciting feeling about observing it. However, the one I see this evening, was more of a negitive feeling. The light hovered in the area for 30 mins or so.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was large, and colorful, and seemed normal, except that it was in the area where airplanes fly. There was a helicopter that was moving in its general direction, and the balloon began to change altitude, moving lower towards the Foothills. I decided it was simply a normal set of stray balloons, but my mother was a little more suspicious, and decided to keep monitoring it. I went to keep watering the plants, when I returned my mother said that the balloon type thing had disappeared into thin air. I found this very strange and failed to locate it myself.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 3-4 minutes later, I spotted similar, if not the same, craft(s) as the day before. They were 30-40 miles away above the Catalina Mountains. They had a blinking that was visible even from that height. They stayed fairly immobile compared to the day before. There were more than last time, and they actually made several shapes. Several times, they formed a rhombus, an arrow pointing right, and various other formations that I could not understand. They seemed to be at a very high altitude, being at maybe 10,000-20,000 feet. After 4-5 minutes, 2 or 3 of the crafts descended and were maybe 4000-5000 feet directly above my area. They moved at a speed that was beyond anything I’ve ever seen before.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have seen similar UFO’s two days in a row. I believe this is not a coincidence. They might be monitoring humans, or giving a personal message, or they could be military devices that haven’t been exposed to the public. Well, I’m not giving this report to tell you my opinion. Thank you for your time.<n>

The closer my vehicle got to the area I realised it wasn&#39;t an airplane, the object was several hundred feet in the air and stationary,the coloring was flat black it looked 2 dimentional and very hard to focus on it&#39;s exact contours.  I slowed down and bent forward to see this thing as I got closer and began passing the area it was hovering traffic was slowing down to get a look as other motorists saw the object also, it still hovered several hundred feet above the foothills I&#39;m not sure what this thing was, but I got the chills as i looked at it.  I don&#39;t really beleive in aliens or the paranormal but what ever this object was it was not an airplane or balloon.<n>

At 0300 in the morning I awoke to what I thought was the big one!(earthquake), but then realized the ground and the house was not shaking.  A sound like I have never heard, was getting louder and louder.  I know what a lighting storm sounds like as well as a wind storm but actually thought a nuclear war began or a big asteroid was heading towards earth.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Sounds funny now, but wasn&#39;t at the time thats for sure.  I have 2 kids and a wife whom I can&#39;t wake up for nothing and yet everyone was up and screaming as soon as this began.  I had enough time to get dressed, put the kids in bed with my wife, tried to calm them down, and step outside to see what was happening.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I opened the front door the sound stopped and it was completely dead quiet.  No rain, no hail, no wind, no birds, just dogs barking.  I talked to all my neighbors later that morning and everyone heard the noise and was frightened by it.  Some are traumatized by the whole ordeal and now have trouble sleeping, incuding my kids that want to sleep with mommy and daddy now.  I only wish I knew what it was.  Nothing was on the news or local paper.  Hopefully there was more than just my neighborhood that heard this.<n>

There was no sound, no flashing light or lights and just one large light. This was not a &#34;falling star&#34; because it moved at approximately 15 degrees along the horizon traveling north to south. it seemed to have a haze or halo around it. I have never seen anything like this and thought it might be an asteroid, meteorite, or comet. Were there any reports of this?<n>

I ran outside and there was something in the sky. It had two flashing lights that were some distance apart, blue and white, and it looked liked a shadowed mass .Seemed to be a little less than the size of a football field and moving slowly<n>

However, within moments I realized something unusual about the crafts overall shaped.  I quickly excused myself off the phone and ran inside my house to call my girlfriend, Lisa, to the back of the house to also observe and further confirm what I was witnessing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Upon Lisa and I&#39;s arrival to the back of the house, just moments later, the craft was still in the sky and still traveling across the western sky moving from North to South through the Constellation of Leo, from above the 40 degree azimuthal grid line to below it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The can best be described as a Triangular shaped craft with three white lights appearing to be located on the vertices of the crafts underbelly and one red flashing light appearing to be located upon the center of the crafts underbelly (ventral).  In addition I was also able to hear what I believe to be engine noise emanating from the craft.  The sound was similar to that of a low steady rumble of a jet engine at high altitude traveling at cruising speed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The craft was also not traveling at any unusual speed or pattern and appeared to be moving across the sky at, would appear to be, a comparatively reasonable speed for any aircraft. In fact, if it was not for it&#39;s close proximity to my location I might have not took notice of it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am a soon to be forty year old male (June 8th) who served honorably as a Security Police Officer in the United States Air Force from 1987 to 1993 and I am currently a Federal Corrections Officer with the Dept. of Justice/Federal Bureau of Prisons and have been for the last fourteen years.

It was making a circular pattern then would suddenly and quickly dart forth in a straight line, and then dart straight straight back along the same line, then resume the circular pattern, much like a helicopter would do while circling. Except it seemed way too high for a helicopter and a helicopter could not move as fast in a straight line as this single light did.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I was sitting in the second row of section 420c (upper deck) with a friend.  I took my eye off the batter to look up at an overhead plane, and on the way, I noticed a small object only about 30 feet away over the field.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The item was charcoal gray, probably metallic, and in the shape of a toaster.  It was only about one foot in size.  It spun around in circles, but always remained parallel to the ground, and had something similar to a reflector light on a bicycle in the upper right corner, which shined like a dimmed light.  It also had a small amount of haze over it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The item must have came in over the third base side of the stadium, I saw it when it was directly in front of me, and continued its path over the first base side of the stadium, accelerating after leaving the stadium, until out of view.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I first looked at it, I thought it was a garbage bag, floating in the wind, but then realized it couldn’t because a garbage bag would roll over rather than remain parallel.  It couldn’t have been a balloon, because it was not going in the exact same direction in the wind, nor was it rising at a fast pace or going straight up.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I did not bother taking a picture of it, because when I saw it, I thought nothing of it, and when I realized this could be something else, it was too small and too far away to get a good shot with my cell phone camera.  However, my friend who I was at the game with saw it, and as many as 1,000 other people sitting in the vicinity could have potentially seen it.<n>

At first I thought it was a balloon or large piece of paper blown by the wind, but then I realized it was too big to be that.  It was about 2 to 3 miles away, and it was floating 300-400 feet off the ground.  It was flashing, and seemed to be spinning as well. The sun was at an angle that I couldn’t see it too well.  It rose at a speed that was far faster than the wind could carry it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was contemplating calling my mom, when another one appeared coming from below and to the right. It went up and joined the other one, it followed it for a few seconds and then went off on it’s own.  I don’t recall what exactly they did in terms of formation. I called my mom over and showed them to her.  She saw them better because she had sunglasses on.  Another one appeared several seconds later. They were flying around erratically, constantly changing altitudes. The highest I saw them get was 4000-5000 feet.  By the time they left there were 4-5 of them and we were sure these were UFO’s. They left going north.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I can’t really say how big they were, but they were big enough to be seen without assistance from very far.  I think they were probes or scouts of some sort, but I’m not sure.  They were definitely NOT something I’ve seen before, except on TV in shows about aliens or UFO’s.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thank you for your time.<n>

It got louder, I looked up seeing a bright triangular craft. It had 4 large red orbs with peachy colored connecters. I ran to the garbage cans.  It moved across the sky musch faster than any plane I have seen.  It put out no exhaust.  I ran to our porch got my Mom, took her out, it was gone.  There was also sort of like fog surrounding the craft.<n>

What really drew my attention was that it wasn’t moving.  It stayed in the same spot for about 2 minutes and then I saw a flash from the object like a reflection perhaps and then it just disappeared. One second it was there and then the next it was just gone. I didn’t see the way it went it just wasn’t there any longer. It was very high in the sky. Location of object was Canton Ga<n>

Another one of these crafts popped out of nowhere for awhile. The first object hovered out of my sight but then a 3rd one of these appeared and just sat in the sky for awhile.

After around five minutes i got out of bed and looked out of the window to see what was the reason for causing such a raucous. I saw a helicopter with bright green lights hovering in the night sky. It seemed cautiously defensive in its movement. Then to my amazement i saw 8 &#34;stars&#34; in the distance, i say stars, it soon became apparent they were not stars as they began to criss-cross each other in a zig-zag manner across the nights sky, jolting from one corner to another with tremendous speed. There was also another object opposite to the centre of the activity glowing/flashing slowly, almost like a beacon to the main 8 objects. Dancing around the night-sky like fireflys, there was then what seemed to be an eagle-shaped golden-glowing object which swooped downwards and then shot-off into the hemisphere with all the other objects zipping off immediately in unison. The golden object almost looked like a gold-man with wings, this sounds really strange but it&#39;s what i saw! In my opinion the helicopter was either monitoring or warding away the foreign-objects, it circled for around ten minutes until the craft had disappeared and then left soon-after.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As a life-long sceptic, i have never seen anything like this at all before and the experience left me jaw-droppingly panicked!<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

At first it look like people were walking in the field with flashlights, but it was around 12:40 a.m.  and I looked again and it was clear the lights were floating in the air as if they were looking for something on the ground. The lights were turning on and floating and then they would turn off and come back on. My brother was also with me and went to get binoculars. I quickly got my blackberry out and filmed the incident. The lights moved around in circular motion and looked to be about 3-4 ft above the ground. They moved around fast and were flashing by a road. The main highway is nearby and a car came over the hill and the lights turned off immediately. As soon as the car was out of sight the lights turned on and started flashing again. There were 3 different lights and the colors seemed to change. My brother returned with the binoculars and said it look like a orb, a round like shape with lights around it. We continued to watch the lights and it was obvious it was a UFO.  The lights begin to spread apart and went there own ways and I observed one light that was green spinned around very fast then flew off. The lights then went out and I began to feel shaken so we went inside. I couldn’t believe that I got it on video so we went inside and uploaded to the computer. You can see the lights but the quality of the video is not so great.  I believe what I seen was a UFO. I seen one close up about two weeks before this incident so I know they are out there!<n>

San Marcos,Tx Couldn&#39;t sleep and was out on tha back deck having a smoke.Heard a jet plane sound,but quite loud and low  pitched,like a passenger jet throttling down to land,but at a steady low tone.No airports around anywhere close,I&#39;m  in the Hill Country,and it was coming right over the house.I got up to look,and a group of 3 lights,2 to the side  like on wing tips,one in the rear,and one just in front of the two,that was strobing.  It was about 1000-1500 ft., up, and the size of a passenger plane.It was only travelling at about 80 -100 mph.I could not see the shape of the  craft,but all the lights were white with no red or green ones.It was travelling in a south west direction and no  airports for at least 80 miles in that direction.I watched it till it was out of sight,about 2 mins.<n>
6/1/09 23:00|San Antonio|TX|Light|10 min|Saw 4-5 bright lights in sky zigzagging up/down and side to side in an extremely fast manner in San Antonio, TX at approx 12:45 am|6/9/09|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/070/S70324.html|373|ndxe200906| Saw 4-5 bright lights in sky zigzagging up/down and side to side in an extremely fast manner in San Antonio, TX at approx 12:45 am<n> <n><n> <n><n> A friend and I were meeting at a parking lot where I was to give her some items after she got off work.  The place we were meeting at was for me a former work place , but one that my friend still works at during the day; the parking lot of the Santiko Embassy theater located off of Bitters Rd near Hwy 281 in San Antonio TX (this location is about a half a mile or less from the San Antonio airport).  The movies had finished and I believe the only cars left were those of the employees still inside.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were standing at our cars just talking when I turned from facing south to the east, and as I looked at the sky I saw lights; as we are near the airport didn’t think anything of it as I just assumed it was one of many planes that fly in and out all hours of the day.  But within what seemed less than a second the light zigzagged not only up and down, but sideways as well.  My first thought was “what the heck”, second thought “helicopter”, third thought, “hell no they don’t move like that”, then I saw that there was more than one light.  It was partially cloudy and the lights would disappear and appear depending on if they were behind a cloud or not.  Because they did not all disappear and appear around the clouds at the same time it was hard to say if there was more than 4 lights or not.  I was not able to judge the distance or height but it appeared to be higher than the landing or takeoff height of the planes around the area of the airport.  Trying to be logical about what I was seeing I then assumed they were doing something at the airport or at least in the vicinity of the airport, something like floodlights; but to the best of my ability during a cloudy sky flood lights appear to shine off the clouds and of course have a trail of light to lead you to their location, not disappear behind the clouds without once showing a trail of light.  Understand that this all took less than a minute while I was just staring at lights; meanwhile my girlfriend (who was facing north towards me) was still talking.  I then shouted out, “did you see that”, and of course she said “what”.  I pointed up to the area where there was now nothing to see as they appeared to have gone behind the clouds; she again said what when suddenly one then 3 or more appeared and were zigzagging all over that one area.  I again asked if she “saw that” and she replied “yes”, and asked her what she thought they were planes or helicopters, she said no way, they don’t move that way or that fast.  We just kept watching them zigzag extremely fas! t in and out of the clouds but always in the same area.  I thought maybe lights from the planes, but that didn’t make sense as they don’t move that fast or zigzag up and down.  We watched for several minutes and talking excitedly about we thought we might be watching and at this time I checked the time and it was 12:48; I believe I first saw the lights at 12:45 and then my friend said “this is just to weird I’m leaving”, by this time I myself was getting scared and said “me too”.  Neither of us had a camera; her cell phone had previously be damaged and the screen would only show black, I had a new phone and don’t know how to use it yet but to be honest didn’t even think about it. Since I only first noticed the lights at 12:45am and stopped watching at 12:55am I have no idea how long they might have actually been visible.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At approximately 12:54 I was driving off, went to hwy 281 and headed north towards hill country where I live 3-4 miles outside the city limits on a bluff overlooking the area both south towards Johnson City and north towards the airport and town.  As soon as I got home I went to the highest point near my home to look at the sky but saw nothing but sky, stars, clouds and the lights from the planes flying overhead.  By this time it was about 1:20 and as I tried to calm down and think of what I should do I went onto my computer and went to white pages where I looked up numbers for the airport and non-emergency Bexar County police.  I got in touch with the airport police and asked them if they were doing anything with lights at the airport which they responded no and asked them if anyone had reported seeing lights.  I explained what I saw and he said no one had called, took my name and we said good night.  At least he asked me my name and thanked me for calling, that he would check around, the Bexar county policewoman who took my call asked me nothing, just listened said no when I asked if anyone else had called then thanks for calling and we hung up.  I’m still excited about what I saw and unless someone can tell me that there was some kind of light show going on at this time of the night on a Monday or anything in the least bit believable, I will always believe I saw UFO’s; but they’d have to be pretty convincing, since as I said there was no normal cloud effects with these lights, just extremely fast zigzagging in and out of them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This morning I got up with the knowledge that I was going to call someone else and report what I saw so I went on line an entered “UFO Sightings” and got you, next I’m going to enter FAA and see if there is a number I can call.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I’m not crazy and in fact worked for 15 years with the Metropolitan Washington Airports Authority before retiring early and moving to San Antonio.  Please somebody tell me something.<n>

I thought to my self &#34;I want to know what you are&#34; you can&#39;t be a satelite next thing I know this light did a sharp angular turn in my direction, I thought how cool, so I started thinking &#34;I want to know what you are&#34; this (what ever it was) came all the way over to above my house (very high distance) and just stopped. I kept thinking &#34;I want to know what you are, but don&#39;t scare me&#34;.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have never had tunnel vision while watching anything in the sky, and my eyes started acting really weird everything went dark (in my vision) except where all I could see was this light.What ever it was stayed there for about 45 min or longer, after that I became a little concerned maybe I asked for the wrong thing and I got a little freaked out so I went inside, it was still hovering there. I have never had anything happen like this before and it was awesome!!!! but kind of scary at the same time. I only started to think &#34; I want to know what you really are&#34; after reading that maybe mental telepathy works with them? and believe me it works. No aircraft I know of could do what I witnessed. I can&#39;t explain it but I&#39;m really looking forward to getting back outside and watching the sky:)I&#39;ve had other experiences in my 51 yrs. but nothing like this.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

It looked to be about 6 football fields long and the width of a football field x 2 high. This thing was approximately 10 to 12 miles away about 9:00 high in the sky. The sky was clear with exception of 2 or 3 small feathery clouds to the west. It was stationary in the sky. This thing was so massive that it is hard to explain. It will get your attention. There was another car in front of me about 300 yards that pulled over and was looking at it also. They left before I could drive up and ask them what they saw.

I was watching TV and occasionally glancing out the windows looking southwest over the Sound. It was around dusk, so I was starting to see some of the lights over on Long Island, but it was still too early to see stars. Noticing something out of the corner of my eye, I glanced up and saw a dim, flickering light, hovering about 20 degrees above the horizon southwest from my house. It appeared over the Saybrook breakwater, in the direction of Plum Island, but seemed so dim and distant that it looked much farther- maybe even over Montauk or the Atlantic.  I was confused, because it hadn&#39;t been there when I last looked, less than a minute ago, so it couldn&#39;t be a star.  But it didn&#39;t appear to be moving, so it couldn&#39;t be a plane.  As I watched it, I thought it might be a plane heading towards me. It appeared to move slightly up and to my left (further north from my perspective) and then faded away.  I didn&#39;t see it again. From what I remember, the light flickered like a star and was slightly pink.<n>

It was not the shape of a plane though. It appeared to be round and was very very bright! The large plane was traveling east towards DFW. It was 8:13 pm and was still very light outside. We watched the plane and the shining object until it went out of site and we could no longer see it. I went inside and called a local news channel (WFAA) to report what we had seen, and possibly get an explanation as to what it may have been. They said they would check on it.  I then looked up this site on the internet and spoke to Mr. Peter Davenport which encouraged me to make a report because so many sightings go unreported. I felt strongly enough about what we had seen, and felt compelled to share this information in hopes that someone else saw the same thing that we had seen. We are all certain it was not a plane!<n>
6/1/09 20:00|Grafton|WV|Unknown|1 minute|A group of small red, white and gold blinking lights flying over my house in West Virginia.|6/9/09|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/070/S70322.html|379|ndxe200906| A group of small red, white and gold blinking lights flying over my house in West Virginia.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have filed a report before regarding lights in the sky behind my house.  Last night I once again saw something strange by my house.  I was watching the sky from my back deck, looking for the lights that I saw on previous nights, when something red caught the corner of my eye.  I turned to my right towards a large tree that sits beside my house.  I saw the strangest thing I have ever seen in my life.  I watched a craft or light of some sort about the size of a kitchen table or slightly larger appear from just over the top of the tree.  It was not very large and I could not make out the shape of it as it was dark.  It looked like a circular shape, perhaps. I saw several lights coming off of it.  These lights blinked and were very bright in intensity.  They were red, gold and white with several blinking at the same time. They appeared to blink in almost a triangular fashion.  I noticed mostly the red color.  The craft drifted at a medium pace across the sky over me from the tree to my right towards another tree to my left.  Then, it disappeared from my view behind the tree.  The duration was about 30 seconds in length.  It made no sound whatsoever. I then became scared and ran into the house.  I got my video camera and came back out about 10 minutes later, but the light never came back.  Later, at night, I laid down to go to bed.  It was about midnight according to the clock.  I closed my eyes for a few minutes and then heard my son cry out, which is common.  I thought that I had just laid down and I was agitated that I had to get up right when I had gotten comfortable.  I sat up and looked at the clock.  Approximately two hours had passed from when I first laid down, only it had felt like only a few minutes to me.  The clock read that it was sometime after two in the morning!  I really do not feel that I fell asleep during that time and feel that I am missing about two hours of time.  I can not say for sure, though.  When I opened my eyes once I heard my son cry, my body hurt all over.  I! thought to myself that it was strange, that I felt as if I had been hit by a truck.  My entire body was very sore.  Today my shoulders hurt, but that may be due to the weather changes.  I am not saying that I was abducted during the night, however I sincerely feel that I am missing almost two hours that I cannot account for.  The other lights I have been unsure of what they are, however what I saw last night I am convinced was not of this world.<n>

I looked up in the sky and I seen this rotating wabboling object in the sky.  It moved southwest over my apartments, and it finally went vertical over the bank.  It was probley pretty high but it was low for only a few seconds.  I didn&#39;t think it was a weather ballon, becuase weather ballons don&#39;t travel that quick.  It was at crusing speed I guess.  Than it was gone becuase it was to far away to see.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.  PD))<n>

High speed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am a firefighter and was leaving home early in the morning to go to the station.  It was still dark out and i was driving North East down my street.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At the stop sign at the end of my street I stopped to adjust my radio.   I was looking in a north east direction when I noticed a very bright light that looked like a star.   I noticed it moving back and forth slowly, not too far in either direction.   I looked in my rear view mirror to see if it could be a light reflecting off my window but saw no lights or cars.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I watched the light it began to move down a little faster and then stopped and shot straight up at steep angle and vanished.   It had no flashing lights and no color other than bright white.   I have never seen any other aircraft reverse it&#39;s angle as fast or move as fast as I have seen this object move.   I live near Burbank airport and see lots of aircraft everyday and night but have never seen anything like this.<n>

It appeared to be a dark gray color. Though the front of the UFO was boomerang shaped, it was unclear if there was any form of a tail or other parts to the UFO. It appeared to be flying at roughly 1000 ft. above the ground. It had 4 very dim lights down each &#34;wing&#34;, totaling 8 dim lights. The object was about 3/4 the size of a crop duster with it&#39;s wing span being approximately 14-16 ft. across. It moved at a relatively fast speed but not extremely fast. It made one slight turn with out leaning to turn then shortly disappeared afterwards. In total we watched it for about 10 seconds. Strangely we heard no noise despite the fact it was so close.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I got at my house at around 1:30 AM when i saw some sort of small light above my house,and it was shooting a yellowish lazor to my house.  It turned slightly, closed the lazor, and flew away. No one in the house was harmed.  The next morning, i went onto my roof to see if anything happened,and a small chunk of my roof was gone.  After i fixed it, i went onto my computer to see if this happened to anyone els, but it froze everytime the windows opened. Everything els was fine, and my neighbors who also had windows had no problum, so i called my comouter frend to fix it. When it was fixed, all the files i had were still there, exept for one with a bunch of UFO pictures.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

I meant it was such the amazingly beautiful sight I have witnessed looking at such the distance that it was at.  It looked as if I could reach out and touch the sucker, where I was on the lanai smoking a cigarette when it shot right by me! Yes!  Nearly right pass my eyes, a block away from me!  It was so close to me for 10 seconds and vanished into where????  I wanted to see it again!  This is not a hoax! What was it????  How can this thing have made it to earth???  It looked like a shooting star, really up close and personal.  And if it was a star, again I ask, how did it make it to earth???  I thought earth was too far away for a star-like object to travel to.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I do know it was not a UFO. I never told anyone but one person and we were on the subject on UFO sightings, a month later.  I had to tell him.  Frankly I absolutely DO NOT believe in any UFO’s at all nor do I believe in Alien like creatures.  I only believe in what I see.  And what I saw that night was of something not from earth.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is a night I will always cherish and remember for the rest of my life.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.
