No sound audible. Moving with a &#39;slow-motion&#39;quality. When first appeared saw an amber light. Then during approach to witnesses saw the triangular light pattern.This was on the night of 2-5-79. Though heard nothing in the media about other seeing this object. If it was a real structure or a possible hologramic projection from an aircraft or satellite is unknown. Twenty days after this we saw--2-25-79 a brilliant copper colored ray--more rar than beam--extend out so far--but the source of this light could not see. Was above a power line. Television was on but picture went radically off the vertical-horizontal.

So a Giant Orange, Red &amp; Yellow fireball came down our street...very slow.  It made NO noise.  It hovered over us going East.... It flew over and passed us then seemed like it took a deep breathe and did the &#34;Hyperspace&#34; thing....<n> <n><n> <n><n> Recently, I have had scoop marks on my upper arm &amp; my rear end...<n> <n><n> <n><n> My wife and I were sleep- she awoke to our whole room filled with bright light.

We arrived there at approx. 2 am. My husband had already taken some of our baggage up the twenty or so steps to the house and was unlocking the front door. I was unloading the few remaining items from the truck. My little dog jumped out of the truck and ran to some nearby garbage cans, I assumed she saw a cat. I just happened to look up to admire the clear, starry night sky. Almost directly above me was a huge, dark triangular shape. It had three lights, one in each corner. I was terrified. I shouted to my husband &#34; what is that?&#34; he said &#34;a helicopter&#34;. It was no helicopter, this thing made absolutely no sound whatsoever and the sheer size of it blotted out the star filled sky above me. I called my dog a few times until she finally came back to me and I grabbed her up. The object will still hanging above me, motionless and without a sound. I ran up the steps to the house and as I reached the porch, the triangle darted off toward in a northeasterly direction. I have no way of knowing just how high it was in the sky but it seemed to me that it must have been quite low due to the enormous span.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.

I had looked out our bedroom window towards the East, and saw an unusual light which appeared to be beyond the Masonic Temple, perhaps over the Potomac River, which we could see from our window about 3 miles away.  It grew in intensity as I watched it as can be seen in the three images. From one of the images it appears it could have been lighting up the foreground, that is, the trees next door, but I the exact position is hard to judge. I don&#39;t recall how the sighting ended or much else about it.  I took three pictures of it with my Nikon F2 - I had kept it loaded with film because I had been taking quite a few pictures of my newborn daughter.  My daughter had been born at home in a snow storm, and it snowed heavily that week she was born.  I remember it was a hazy night when this light appeared.  The Masonic Temple was lighted up as can be seen in the pictures.  Recently (2007) I was going through old pictures to digitize and came upon the images again.  If I can figure out how to, I will upload them here.  The sighting caught me at a time when I had a newborn child at home as was not getting all that much sleep, so how it affected me may not be relevant.  However, it did seem to enhance my feelings of well-being about existence at the time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD))<n>

My girlfriend wgo was with me also saw it. The interesting thing about is that we felt some kind of mental contact from it which alerted usto it&#39;s presence.<n> <n><n> <n><n> While driving on a country road, my girlfriend and I got an impulse, or I guess you couldcall it an irresistable impression or desire to look out and upward through the windshield. We had to lean forward, which we both did at the exact dame time. Upward and slightly to the right of us was a disk shaped object. This happened in just an instant. It was there, then it was gone. It actually was visible for a little less than second, this is why neither I nor my girlfriend, could recall any details of the object, other than it&#39;s shape and color. I just remember that it was silver and disk shaped. After the event, I of course discussd the incident with my girlfriend and both remembered going through the same experience and seeing the same thing. I have to admit that we both were stunned and awed by the experience. What impressed us most about the event was the psychic or mental impulse we both had at the exact same time to look in the exact direction and place where the object was. What we would really like to know is whether the mental attraction we experienced was something that the object generated to anyone who was within a certain distance or radius to the object, or was the impulse directed specifically to my girlfriend and I?<n>

One slow pulsing light in middle. Object went over in a slow-motion manner. No sound. Followed by 2 more in general area of 140 S. Thomas Rd.Tallmadge, Ohio. 02/25/79--ray brilliant mirror shiny copper color. Above power line in mobile home park ,where my father and I resided. He died 10/31/90. I was 23,and he was 55 at the time. Then March 4,1979. This last one seemed to co-related to day of century days and day since age indays since our birthdates --6-11-23---8562---9-24-55---20355 days added together 28917th day of century and age in days of father and son 28917. Look at Majestic 12 dates---Notice any dates ending in a 62 or 00. 36524 divided by 1/2 18262-Then go forward or bacwards every 100 days. Notice if you use a 1658 day algorithym added from 18262 you will eventually come to an even 36500 days! It is also strange that if you take 1658 day from the 1st wtc attack of 2-26-93 you will always come to 9-11 0f any year except  leap year years. 1658 days separated the Kennedy brothers death. Chech your ufo cases and see how many sightings occur with century dates ending in 62 0r 00. I would also look at century day dates ending in 04--adding this 1658 will land you on a date ending in a 62 for example 22762-Figure what the month day and year this corresponds to. This could be being used in time-series statistical calculations. These ufo sightings I reported--but not officially to the UFO Flying Saucer Investigating Committee,on 9-5-80. A ((name deleted)) was the main person. Then 6 days later an unmarked military green helicopter flew over low over the spot where the copper ray was over a power line at 12:15p.m. Thank you.<n>

We were both Fine Artists. We wanted to get away from Los Angeles, the school system, and the &#34;rat-race.&#34; We were living in a Lake side Home, at the time of this incident.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I, being a night-owl, had a habit of watching late night TV. It was a cold winter, clear night, after a rather large snow fall. Our Lake-side Chalet type home had large windows, overlooking the Lake--a great view.  As usual, I was alone, on the upper level, watching TV, hoping to become sleepy. The rest of the family were downstairs, in bed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> During a commercial, I looked out the window, onto the deck, and saw 3 bright, round objects over the Lake. They looked like 3 full moons, in a row. The first one was large, middle one, was smaller, and the 3rd one, was the smallest--like the &#34;3 Bears&#34;. They were moving along at a steady pace, over the Lake--white in color, very solid--very self contained. no light radiating outside their perimeters. There was no sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I wanted to call my husband, but knew that by the time I went downstairs, and awakened him, they would have disappeared around the curve of the Lake-which is the course they were headed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am very much skeptical of UFO sightings--so I thought maybe they were weather balloons, or, ect. I never heard of anyone else that saw them, so I still don&#39;t know what they were. I have heard of other sightings in the Lk Arrowhead, Big Bear area. My husband is more of a UFO buff than I, having had a sighting when he was an Airforce Pilot. He was a little disappointed that he hadn&#39;t been awake to see what I tried to describe.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date may be approximate, although the witness does not indicate that fact.
