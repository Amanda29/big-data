We express our sincere gratitude to the person who submitted.  We compliment her on her ability to write well in English, and on her penmanship!<n> <n><n> <n><n> U. S. Forces landed in northwest Africa in November 08, 1942.  PD))<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> Dear Sir,<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have always heard that UFO sightings date back to the end of WWII, but I know about one that was witnessed by my own grandfather and 9-year-old uncle in 1942.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The place was Montagny, a small village in the centre of France.  Time of the year:  Autumn, the day before the Allies landed in North Africa.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It happened at night.  My grandfather and uncle had gone out to a farm to buy potatoes, in spite of the curfew, imposed by occupying Germany.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They were in a hollow ((empty??)) lane, in the dark, when suddenly a thing, saucer-shaped, with a &#34;window-like in a train compartment, started next to them from behind a hedge.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The thing hovered there for a moment, then went away at a tremendous speed, without making any noise.  Planes were so noisy then that they made the ground shake, when there were a lot of them at a time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> You can imagine their fright!  My grandfather died in 1975, but he still trembled and shook when he told that story.  My uncle died a year ago, and he hated talking about it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It is absolutely out of the question that my grandfather invented that story.  Also, he told the family immediately, well before people started talking of U.F.O.’s.<n> <n><n> <n><n> He told the story to a distant cousin, who had been a colonel in the French army, but apart from that, the story has never been outside the family.  My grandfather would not have like any publicity about it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As he said, it could not be something immaterial because it made some dead leaves swirl on the ground.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It could not be a hallucination because they both saw the same thing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Was it something human-made?... a German spy plane, or something like that?  Maybe, but I have yet to see a saucer-like plane that moves without making a noise.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So, what was it?  If you know, I’d be glad to know, too.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I don’t think many people saw that thing, because there weren’t many people wandering outside at night in Nazi-occupied France in 1942!  (But if you heard about similar sightings, I’d like to know, too)<n> <n><n> <n><n> Yours Sincerely,<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((name deleted))<n>
