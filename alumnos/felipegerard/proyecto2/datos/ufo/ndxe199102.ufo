It was stationary.  I drove maybe three miles until I was almost directly underneath.  I stopped my car and stood watching for several minutes.  It was long and cylindrical, noisless,  brilliant yellow gold, and had several, maybe 5 brilliant pink and blue dots (lights) blinking on and off, flying around it but not attached.  I watched for several minutes, until it began to move slowly west toward Alabama.  It was like nothing I have ever seen.  I am convinced it was not of this earth.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.  PD))<n>

A year previous my daughters friend was histerical while walking her dog at same complex , said a light from a space ship was trying to suck her up. We were skeptical but once we saw the craft we then knew she was very serious. One thing, there was low cloud cover on both days so when ever there are low clouds I get scared.<n>

A spec. 4 and I were on guard duty sitting in a 5-ton truck at the guard entrance in the desert.  There were other brass (officers) standing around with their jeeps parked in the area.  I remember her eating some raw onions and I was questioning her.  I decided to role down my window some more and saw a very large dark object from afar slowly moving towards the back of the truck.  i saw it in my side view mirror. it was not a sand storm. I saw other people turn their heads towars the object and told the spec 4 to look in her mirror. when it got over top the truck, it seemed like it was so close that if there was a building in the way, it might have knocked it over.  I looked forward and could see the light of the horizon, but I could no longer see any horizon on the sides of us.  but then when the object was completely over all of us, our area became pitched dark.  the spec 4 started to hollar for jesus and I told her to lock all of the doors and roll up the windows.  I did not hear any noise.  We turned on our flashlights and there was no reflection on the flashlight or our headlights or anybody elses headlights.  i could only see the circle of light from the flashlight, but it could not shine on anything. we could not start our engine. It seemed like a very long time, almost like a half hour.  I knew that it happened about 1500 hours because i could not wait to go off duty at 1600 hours.  I remember telling the spec 4 to be very quiet.  I was calm, but nervous.  It seemed like a real long time, but it was only about 3-5 minutes when i looked at my watch again.  I am not sure if my watch stopped during that time or not, but it was a few minutes after 3pm, then i looked in my side view mirror because I saw a glimmer of light.  I could see the horizon behind the truck,come back again and then I could see the sides of outside light again.  I could not see the top of the object, only part of the underside which was very flat. ! It seeme d like the object was a mile wide because I could not tell how big it was.  Looking at the beginning edge moving over us, it had a slight bend like a spherical shape.  The color looked like dark copper underneath the object. It looked kind of rigidy like symbols too.  The object was moving at a very slow pace over us. I rarely talk about it.  I had always wondered if anyone else ever spoke of it in the blogs, but I just learned about using blogs this year.  It was only one mothership of an object.  Afterwards, one of the brass (officers) approached us and was just as baffled as we were about the object.  He said that if he wrote home about it no one would belive him anyway.  I agreed. I did not want anyone to think I was bananas too.  Okay, that&#39;s it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD))<n>

St. Helena which is just North of the small town of Calistoga, 66 miles North of San Francisco.  I&#39;m not for sure on the date though, or the exact time, but it was late afternoon.  We were hiking down the mountain when my dad was stopped watching something in his binoculars.  I finally asked him what he was looking at, and without telling me, handed me the binoculars.  I looked through them and spotted a golden round orb, which at first I thought was an escaped party balloon.  It seemed to be about a mile away, and was maybe 3 feet in diameter.  It floated to the right at a good speed and made a U-turn and disappeared behind a hill.  My dad later told me that the object was a lot closer than a mile.  He thought it was maybe 300 yards away to the East.  The sighting seemed to last about 2 minutes.  It moved very smoothly, no erratic movements.  It was gold and perfectly sphere, about 3 feet across, if it was 300 yards away.  I understand orbs are a common UFO sighting and seem to be remotely controlled.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  One of five interesting reports from same witness.  PD))<n>

It was around midnight in August. We were talking about meteorits and with us was a girl which has never seen a shooting star in her live when she suddenly asked: Well - is that one of them? We looked up to the sky and short above the wood on the other side of the river there were three lightballs, shimmering in different colours, flying in a triangle formation, all the waydown the river to the east in a constant height. They were not very fast. But they have been for sure no airplanes. It seemed to be two or three miles away and for this distance it must have been very big.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We must have been the only ones who watched this, becaus there was no report in the newspapers.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I made a little movie of this.

Flying North East to South West, it was huge and had lights of different colors and lasted for about five minutes.  It was reported that Law Enforcement also reported this sighting.  And I believe that the Selma Enterprise weekly news paper also reported the sighting by other people.  I remember it well.

2/1/91 20:00|Quartzite (20 miles east of)|AZ|Light||Large object with a row of white lights on one side and row of red lights on other (about six each) hovering over rest stop in Arizona,|8/5/01|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/002/S02322.html|9|ndxe199102| Summary : Large object with a row of white lights on one side and row of red lights on other (about six each) hovering over rest stop in Arizona, February 1991.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I read with interest your news releases about the sightings in Arizona in March 1997.  My husband and I were traveling to Tucson in February 1991 on a very dark night.  At about 10:00 I noticed a row of lights in the distance.  I thought there must have been a house on a hill with all its lights on.  It looked like it was about a mile or so away.  As we approached it appeared that the brightness of the lights suddenly increased, as if the &#34;house&#34; had tilted.  We approached a rest stop, about 20 or 25 miles east of Quartzite, Arizona, where the lights were hovering.  There were about six white lights in a row.  Since it was so dark I thought they were some high antennas over the rest stop.  I could see no object, only the lights.  We had never been there before and were not familiar with the area.  There were also two smaller red lights in the area that seemed to be slowly moving.  Since our car was traveling at about 65 miles per hour, I thought they were also antennas, but !thought it was odd that they seemed to be moving.  As we passed the white lights, I said to my husband, who was driving, &#34;There are some strange lights up there.&#34;  He only had an opportunity to glance up and see the white lights, but since they were quite high in the sky, perhaps 100 feet, he only saw them momentarily. As we passed, I looked back, and there were the same number of red lights on the other side, which were blinking somewhat randomly, not in any pattern.  We continued on to Tucson, and I asked someone who was familiar with that road if they ever saw any odd lights at that rest stop, and he said he thought he had, so I dismissed them as antennas.  On the way home, we took at good look at that rest stop during the day, and there were no high antennas and no hills or mountains nearby.  We have been on that road several times since then, and once we took a frontage road near that rest stop and noticed there was a power plant about 1/4 mile from there that could not b!e seen from the highway.  Last February my husband and I again traveled to Tucson at night and stopped at that rest stop to get a few hours sleep.  The only lights we saw were some red ones on a low post that were more or less vertical, and definitely much closer to the ground than the ones we had witnessed that night.  We have mentioned the sighting to a few people but never have officially reported it.<n>
