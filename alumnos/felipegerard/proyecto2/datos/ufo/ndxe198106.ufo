It was recently revived when my brother-in-law who I did not know in the early 80’s told a story that matched mine identically.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In 1981 or ’82, I was standing on our front porch in Missouri talking to my son and a friend who were about 12 at the time.  It was after dark and the weather was warm.  Suddenly, we became aware of something above us and I don’t recall any noise.  It was a starry, clear night but we looked up and could see no stars directly above us even though we could still see stars towards all the horizons.  There were lights traveling in a triangular formation so at first we thought that three planes were moving slowly from the southwest to the northeast.  We finally realized that the lights were outlining a huge single triangle shape which was blocking the stars from our view.  It lasted only a few minutes before it moved slowly beyond the tree line, but was long enough for us to discuss it.  Afterwards everything returned to a clear starry night.  We wondered if it was an experimental craft from a nearby military installation but thought it was too large to be anything we had ever hea! rd about.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Recently, my son’s friend who is now the CEO of a corporation asked if I remembered that night and our encounter with a UFO.  Then my brother-in-law recounted the time in the early 80’s when he was dining at a table by a corner window in an exclusive restaurant on the 22nd floor of a building in a nearby city.  It was a clear starry night when suddenly he became aware of something moving towards the building from the southwest that was triangular and enormous.  It blocked the night sky and had lights at the points of the triangle.  He and his party thought it was going to collide with the building but it moved over the building and all returned to normal.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date is approximate.

I was walking the 1/2 block home and my mind was preoccupied with whatever it was that had just happened at work.  This I can remember for some reason.  I recall seeing something about the size of a commercial plane (I don&#39;t remember it being overly large or small) that was not so very far off the ground, maybe a half mile.  This was after dark so I don&#39;t remember seeing a shape per se.  I do remember that it was silent and had lights rather like windows.  I remember thinking that it was strange that it made no sound.  I remember it passing over at a leisurely speed, slower than I&#39;d expect an airliner to be going.  I did not believe in UFO&#39;s at the time so I didn&#39;t really pay it much attention as my mind was focused on whatever problem had occurred at work.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;d love to have the opportunity to see it again now that I&#39;m more full! y aware of worldwide sightings.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

I was at ball park in Paragon, IN. I was on bleachers on north side of ball park. It was night and I was there with friend who’s dad was there next to ball park at horseshoe court in tornament.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Between the hills to the north of town and the graveyard hill to the east of town there is a space that Kinda forms a v shape opening. As me and my friend where atop the bleachers we noticed in the opening between the hills a large orange object in sky. It appeared to resemble the sun except it did not extend light from itself. Also it was like the sun except it was like someone taking a ball and smashing down from top and bottom, making it oblong shape.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object moved from behind one hill and slowly moved across opening till it disappeared behind the other hill. After a few secs it reappeared and slowing  moved back till it went behind the hill it came from the first time. I was as though not everyone could see what we were seeing. I looked over to horseshoe court and was amazed that none of the adults playing horseshoes seemed not to see this large orange thing in the sky. At which point my curiosity got the better of me and I had decided that if it reappeared then I was going to get on my Huffy bike and take of out in country in that direction to get a better look. A few secs later after it disappeared the second time it reappeared and started slowly back the direction as it did the first time. So I took of all alone as my friends were to afraid to go with me. I can’t say I wasn’t afraid myself, I was just more curious. About ¼ of the way out it disappeared behind the hill. I then stopped peddleing and just sat there on the seat of my bike. It was if I could sense it was over. So I just sat there for a few and realized it wasn’t coming back. At which time I returned to ball park.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

To my knowledge I don&#39;t know how his event could have been a hoaxed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The year was about 1981 or 1982 and I was seven or eight years old at my home in Raynham, MA. It was just around dusk time in the front yard of my house when I happened to look up to sky and, at 4:00, saw a disc shaped object. I vividly remember the object as being disc shaped with a raised bump in the middle, silver colored, completely still and silent. The strangest part of the episode was that the object was slanted down at an angle almost as if staring at me. I watched, frozen in awe, for about two minutes before running inside the house to get my parents and a camera. By the time we made it back to the front yard, the object was gone. Moments later we all saw a shooting star.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The next night I again saw the same exact object but this time on the left sky. It was doing the exact same thing, just hovering there suspended in mid air at a downward slant. This time I stayed put and yelled for my parents who came outside but when I glanced away it was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

Sometime during the day We decided to go somewhere and leaving the apartment building we got inside my car.   As we backed up from our parking space we noticed a sphere shaped flying object around 25-100&#39; diameter moving from the south -southwest.  I passed without sound at what seemed like an altitude of 1000-2000 feet up.  Now that I am much older and seen many Jet planes in flight can guess its speed.  It was moving at at least 600-1000 mile per hour. I said to her, look , see that? She saw it.  And as we began to drive forward in the car I noticed it was going behind  the roof of a neighboring apartment building.  We Rounded left on the drive way/ road and  catching sight of it again saw it moving/continuing northward in a perfectly straight line.  Then we just went about our business. Not gi! ving it any real thought as to what is was.   We didn’t know what it was, so we forgot about  pretty quick.  It was a dull semi shining metal looking object , no windows, just  round shape. Almost like color of lead sinkers used in fishing and dull aluminum.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

6/30/81 00:00|Huntsville|AL|Circle|during sleep|woman figure in red bodysiut with large head|4/13/10|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/074/S74412.html|9|ndxe198106| woman figure in red bodysiut with large head<n> <n><n> <n><n> Sometime during 1981 I had a dream that has not left my memory.  I now believe it was not a dream but an abduction experience.  This occurred in Huntsville, Alabama at night. I have three memories: I was placed in a seat that looked like plastic similar to fast food restaurants.  It was curved and had a high back that protruded above my head.  I was not belted in the seat but I was stuck there and could not move.  My eyes were open but unable to move so I could only see in front of me.  There was a man sitting across from me in a same type of seat, and he was not moving either.  I could see more seating behind him but with the design I could not see anyone sitting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The second memory I woke up and was on a table in the middle of a room.   I was laying with my head in the south and my feet in the north.  My eyes could not look around, but I could see part of the ceiling and part of the wall on my right.  It appeared to look rounded and somewhat reminded me of commercial office partitions, grey/silver and flat.  I did not know where I was, then my head rolled to the left and I saw a woman walking up a small ramp to a door that I heard open with a &#34;swish&#34; sound, like a hatchback car when you open it.  I could see a little of the hall way and it appeared to curve slightly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The woman was wearing a red bodysuit and seemed to be physically fit.  I saw her head was different, it was larger in the back like it was deformed and her hair was blonde and extremely thin like a chemo patient that is losing most of their hair.  She was on the west side of the room and to the left of me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> She had to know I was looking at her from behind because after the door opened she quickly turned and looked at me.  I saw her in the front view before she knocked me back out apparently with her mind, she did not say anything.  Her body seemed human but I have never seen a face similar to her.<n> <n><n> <n><n> She had a bigger forehead and bigger eyes than a human, her nose was extremely small, almost no cartilage and reminds me of Michael Jacksons small nose.  Her mouth was small too with very thin lips.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The last memory I was in a different seat facing west looking at black windows.  I saw the seat I had been in and it was emply, I still could not look around but I saw a door to the north behind the seat I was in in the first memory.  I was next to the wall and remember the rectangle rounded windows.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date during 1981 is approximate.  PD))<n>

That summer there had been a lot of UFO&#39;s sighting in Quebec.  I remember seeing it in the news paper.  That night we had a small get together with neihbors.  The adults had a camp fire going.  I remember at one point that my friends and I left the party to take a walk close to the field.  That&#39;s when we saw the object.  The object was floating about 15 feet over top of the field it was horizontal with red lights.  I could hear some kind of humming sound, but it was not an helicopter.  The movements were too smooth to be an helicopter. It was just floating for a while and at some point sarted to go from left to right back and forth making cross like movement. It felt like something in there saw us and got affraid.  And suddenly it left really quickly and totally disapeared in a matter of a few seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The next day we went to look in the field to see if we would be able to see something on the ground but we did not see anything.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

Have wanted to report this every since I witnessed it years ago. It bothers me that I do not know what it was I saw. The Object was in my best estimate 20 to 30 feet in diameter,  And was stationary just above a tree line 30 feet from roadway. It was so bright in illuminated my dash board of my car. We saw it about a 1/4 mile away and thought it was the moon,  As we got closer it was obvious that it was very near to us.We pulled off roadway next to object.  No sound noticeable from object, It was an intense orange color and grew in size as we watched it. It had the appearance of molten glass and as it grew larger what looked like static electricity dissipated from its perimeter.  It grew dimmer as it got larger then simply just vanished only to reappear as a smaller more brighter sphere as before. I felt I co! uld throw a rock at it and hit it as it was so close.  Then it vanishes again. we could see stars in background where object was. Sped home to retrieve a Polaroid camera when we returned we waited at the site, Object never returned. Later on in years I met someone who saw a similar object in the same area!  I am very knowledgeable in physics and am a private sport pilot. But can not identify the object from that night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date is approximate.  PD))<n>

My brother and a herd of our friends had converged on Lake Whitney located in North Central Texas to our favorite spot, Soldiers Bluff. We partied well into the night, and it wound up being just myself, my brother and two or three friends that were still awake at 2:00 am.<n> <n><n> <n><n> While the two or three friends stayed at the campsite talking and playing cards, my brother and I went fishing off of Soldiers Bluff.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was there, while sitting on an ice cooler, rod in hand…eyes on the stars, that we witnessed this event.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had noticed a white light moving across the sky that was to close to be a satellite in orbit. As I watched this light, I noticed a smaller one appear next to it that I assumed was the other “wing light” of the “Plane” and that it was turning towards us. As it continued to “Turn”, (One was slightly higher than the other) the lights got further and further apart. The further apart they got, the more I thought to myself “My God, That’s a HUGE Plane. As they leveled off, seven smaller lights appeared to swoop into formation with the other two lights. They now were heading in the opposite direction they had originally been traveling.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The first light was very large and round and white. This was being followed by seven smaller round white lights. The light taking up the rear was a large white rectangle. We stared in total disbelief as the 9 craft soundlessly floated across the sky in front of us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We remarked to each other as to what they could be and finally decided it was a small plane pulling a lighted banner. AS SOON AS I said that to my brother, the craft in the rear raised up slightly higher than the others and SHOT forward halfway up the formation, very quickly, where it stopped and slowly floated down thru them to be below them where it hung there motionless until the last little light passed it. As the last light passed over it, It raised back up behind the last little light and continued across the sky, taking up the rear, till they were finally indiscernible.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We had asked our friends if they had seen them also. They said that they had, but I don’t believe that they did, due to their  lack of astonishment (that was very evident in my brother and I)<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date is approximate.

My fiancé (now my wife) and I were somewhere past the Arizona/New Mexico border going east on I-10 in the wee hours of the morning, Thursday, June 18, 1981.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were barely across the NM border somewhere near Mondel, NM, as I noted hwys 80 and 338 coming in from the south as the next signs of any roads. I’m not sure of the exact time, but we had been driving since 4 p.m., stopped to eat for a half-hour in Tucson, and it’s about ten hours to Deming where I have relatives. I remember this because I knew we’d miss them as we’d drive by too early in the morning. So I place this observation at between 2:30 and 3:30 a.m.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As we were driving, totally alone on the open stretch of pretty straight highway, we both noticed a very bright light to the north. At first, because of the intensity, we thought it was rather close. But as we kept driving, and it remained in about the same position, we kept talking about it and placing it farther and farther away. We were traveling along for at least ten minutes and we could still see it directly north of us, perhaps the equivalent of one car length more westerly than when we had first observed it. It did not seem to be moving. This was 1981 and I don’t think I had ever seen any vapor, tungsten, halogen or other lights - just fluorescents and incandescents. I had seen a search-light close up, and this was the intensity of about twenty of those. The light was not directed at anything, had more of an emission than a beam, and it did not appear to be moving. The only reason we noticed it as strange was that it had such brightness from so far away. We could see that it was above the landscape, no more than a hundred feet, but it just looked like a very intense factory lighting system that appeared (at our distance) to be one solid light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then it moved, or I should say &#34;shot&#34; from our left to directly in front of us. In less time than our eyes could adjust and follow, the light was above I-10 about three hundred yards ahead. It didn’t have any searching quality. The movement made no noise (we had our back windows open.) We could make out no shape. It was just one intense source of white light which flooded everything on the ground around it and us. This one light could fill six football fields. I instinctively moved my foot to the brakes but, before I could apply them, it again shot up and to our right (south) and disappeared into the sky above us in less than two seconds. This time our eyes followed it, she out her window and I through the sunroof, until it just blipped out. We both said, &#34;That was no building!&#34;  Fortunately, we both witnessed the same thing and talked about it for many miles afterward.

Several miles off in the distance on the horizon I noticed somthing was moving, I wasnt sure but there was a mountain that I could use as a refrence point. A light was moving up, down and sidways. When it would get close to the ground, it looked like lightning or electricity was being discharged from it, then it would shoot up in the air a good distance and start gyrating around like an angry bee, great big loops and zigzags.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We all watched for over an hour as it just did the same thing over and over,then got back in our motorhome and went back too Henderson where my brother lived. I cant say for sure where I was at, I wasnt familiar with the area. But I was looking into the Northern sky, and we were to the East of Las Vegas.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

As I looked up an object slowly floated into view. It was rectangular, dark and moving VERY slowly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I thought at first it must be a plane but could see no blinking lights or light of any kind, then of course nothing where a fuselage would be, and what would be wings weren&#39;t swept back and were squared off and not tapered like wings. There was no sound. It was only visible because of the city light vaguely illuminating it&#39;s underside.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My friend had continued on several yards still talking to me, noticed that I had stopped and was looking up at something. So he looked up to see what i was looking at. By the time he saw the thing it had moved about a third of the way across the piece of sky that we could see.  I was starting to notice all kinds of unusual detail on the thing, like rods protruding and lines underneath.<n> <n><n> <n><n> And there was really something strange about the way it was moving. And another REALLY odd thing was... I seemed to be able to hear the thoughts in my friends head.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It seemed that once he noticed the strange motion, that it seemed to move a liitle and then stop, move and stop, like it was swaying, but not side to side but up and down, I thought I heard him think to himself &#34;Is it a Bird?&#34; Then I said out loud to his unvoiced question &#34;No, it&#39;s not a bird&#34;<n> <n><n> <n><n> We stood there transfixed, watching as it moved out of view behind a building. I ran to the end of the alley to try and spot it again but there was a bright street light in my eyes. My friend stood there transfixed, he said more because of me reading his mind than what we had seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of sighting is approximate.  PD))<n>

I was giving him a ride home down Walton Ferry Rd heading due east. Walton Ferry runs down one side of a huge peninsula that ends at the lake. His home was at the end on a road going across to Sanders Ferry Rd. which runs parallel to Walton Ferry. We were roughly one mile from the end at the lake when he spoke up and said \&#34;hey, do you see that?\&#34;. I looked up and over the lake were five or six strange looking lights about half way to three quarters up in the horizon. They were in a straight line with the front light rotating to the end of the line about every 3 to 5 seconds. They were very bright and seemed to be hovering over the lake. I don\&#39;t recall any colors, just white lights. Very bright white lights. Brighter than any aircraft we had ever seen. I slowly pulled the car over to the side of the road as did a couple of cars behind us who evidently saw what we did. The speed limit along this road is 45 and is heavily traveled. Neighborhoods all the way to the end. After about 30 seconds or so, the front light rotated to the rear and the then lead light literally shot up into the sky/space and the others followed. They moved at a speed that was literally unbelievable. We looked at each other, looked back at the people behind us, and all were like us with their mouths wide open and looks on their faces like what the heck was that?! We slowly pulled away from the side of the road and I proceeded on to his house. We must have been quite pale upon our arrival because his wife at the time even commented to the effect of \&#34;what have ya\&#39;ll been up to?\&#34;. He was 23 or 24 at the time and I was 19 or 20. No drugs and no alcohol were involved! We see each other maybe once a year now, usually at a 4th of July party, but we have not spoken about this in quite some time. However, all the other has to say is, \&#34;do you remember\&#34; and the other instantly knows what is meant. As a matter of refe! rence, I was watching the Rendleshon show on SciFi earlier, which prompted me to write this. The lights on the show, when over the farmers field bears a great resemblance to what we saw that night. The thing that amazes me the most is the fact that the time frame fits when we had our siteing. I can only imagine what was going on back 23 or so years ago. I can honestly say, this incident made us both believers. The speed would be the main deciding factor. There is nothing man-made on this planet that can manuever or go that fast. Thanks for the space to tell this story. I will never ever forget what we saw that night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> distance = 1 mile covered = Ping pong ball? duration = 30 seconds conditions = Clear and calm under clouds = cloudless physical traces = N/A power out = N/A effects = Just amazement and bewilderment.<n> <n><n> <n><n> anything else = witnesses = 5 or 6 contact = no permission = yes prefer = email<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

6/15/81 22:00|Aberdeen|WA|Cylinder|1 hour|Cylindrical craft crashes near Aberdeen WA|10/8/07|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/059/S59115.html|19|ndxe198106| Cylindrical craft crashes near Aberdeen WA<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am estimating the date and time of this event due to the amount of time that has passed. I do remember that it was shortly after I graduated high school (1980), and had landed a job at the local mall as a maintenance employee.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I remember leaving work and proceeding north through south Aberdeen, and had to stop at a red light before proceeding over the Chehalis river bridge. To my surprise, a long convoy of military vehicles was headed south over the bridge, pulling trailers, some covered with tarp, others obviously diesel generators, along with one truck pulling a piece of heavy equipment (bulldozer). I just thought there were military exercises taking place somewhere and thought nothing more about it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Later that day, I heard local radio, reporting that a cylindrical shaped object was seen over interstate 5 near or at Olympia WA, and that the craft was headed West. This craft was witnessed by hundreds if not thousands of people already.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The craft was now reported by eye witness accounts to have been following State Route 12 West towards the coast. The craft was witnessed flying low, not very fast, and was on fire, but emitted no smoke and made no noise The craft was under some sort of control, as witnesses reported that it followed the highway, making turns to correct course.  It had flown over sparsely populated areas, and was later seen flying &#34;along highway 12&#34;, through the vicinity of Central Park, a outlying area East of Aberdeen, and again witnessed by hundreds, (motorists and residents of Central Park).<n> <n><n> <n><n> Before the craft entered the city of Aberdeen itself, it took a fairly large turn to the left, flying over Junction City, across the town of Cosmopolis, and was now headed South West towards Westport WA.  Witnesses reported the craft to have followed the Westport highway to the point of the Elk River bridge where it turned abruptly to the left, flying directly over the bridge and followed the Elk River South East where one witness reported it crashing with a white flash on the visi! ble hori zon.  The area of the crash is forest land accessible only by logging roads.<n> <n><n> <n><n> No explanation was given as to what it was by any Government agency.  Residents in the vicinity of the crash site reported that the military cordoned off the area and installed road blocks into the area denying any entry. Reports by residents, (rumors) that some of the teenage boys took dirt bikes out and rode as close as they could,”after already trying the roads and having been sent away by armed soldiers”, and hiking through the timber, where they reported seeing tree tops broke. They reported seeing a roughly 70 foot long cylindrical craft, lit by flood lights, with men moving about the craft in protective clothing, “obviously what the diesel generators were used for”. About 10 years later, while working another job, I had the opportunity to speak personally with one resident who lived in the area of the site, who was a fellow co-worker of mine. He told me, “one of those teenage boys on the dirt bikes was his”, and that many days after the event, “government sedans had stopped at many of the residents homes to ask what they had seen, and to not continue to spread rumors”. He also said that some residents had been “threatened to shut up or else”. This was big news for about a week in the area, but died out just like the rest. I recall my co-worker telling me that they flew the craft out, wrapped in canvas tarp towards the ocean slung under a sky crane helicopter. Weeks later, after many calls to the local authorities, the local radio reported that the government reported  that it had been a small airplane that crashed. Nothing more was ever reported, but to this day I believe what I saw (the convoy), and what the neighbors in the area saw to be true. I truly believe, if this was not a crash of a then new cruise missile, to be a craft from another place, and another Roswell, but due to the time and place, receive much less publicity. This incident happened in the evening, while I was working, my shift ending at 07:00AM, so the m! ilitary response was pretty rapid since the heavy equipment was assembled and in the area in less than 9 hours, as witnesses in Central Park were calling in reports to authorities around 22:00 hrs. Fort Lewis WA is less than 2 hrs from Aberdeen, and probably less than 3.5 hrs from the actual crash site. No other aircraft were reported in the air visually, with the stricken craft. All witnesses reported seeing flames emanating from the craft and they also reported that it made no engine noises, or any noise at all. If it was a cruise missile it would have been emitting sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD))<n>

It was night time and i was going out to feed the animals when i saw a pair of lights in the south east heading towards the north west.  at first i thought it was a pair of lights on the wingtips of a low flying airplane so i didn&#39;t pay much attention to them.  but then it accured to me that i couldn&#39;t hear any sound of an engine so i looked at them again and noticed that there was nothing in between the two lights.  i then thought that it might be a pair of satilites moving in the same direction.  since i lived in the country, i had an excillent view of the night sky without any street lights or lights from buildings to obstruct my view.  as i took a harder look at the lights, i noticed that they left a trail, like a jet plane would leave, trailing behind them, but there were only two lights and i could plainly see three trails.  i called out to my brother to come and have a look, but he wasn&#39;t able to come outside, but my mother did and she saw them too.  i don&#39;t know what they were, but i don&#39;t understand how two lights can leave three trails.  As i was looking s.e.  one light was slightly on my right, the other on my left.  both moving at the same speed and in the same direction.  the two lights left thin trails behind them as they moved across the sky.  to the left of the light on my left, i could plainly see a third trail, a wider trail, but there was nothing there to cause it.  Another time i saw something was when i was out driving truck cross country.  my trainer was in the bunk sleeping and i was driving the night shift.  just as i crossed the state line from california into arizona, i saw a ball of light streak across the sky in front of me and appear to crash into the hills.  the ball of light was green.  the first thing i did was turn on my c.b. radio and listened to see if anyone else had seen it.  no one mentioned anything about it on the radio.  my first thought was that maybe i had seen it and no one else did or maybe it was my ima! gination.  then i figured it might have been a meteorite falling to earth.  the green glow could have been cause by copper deposits in the meteor burning as it went through our atmosphere.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

We were hiding away from our babysitter. It was my youngest brother who spotted it first. From a distance, but clear as day, my other brother and myself looked up to see what our younger brother was looking at. It was then that we stopped tormenting the babysitter (who was trying to get us down off the roof) and just sat there, watching this dim and yet bright yellow oval shapped object just hover, suspendid in animation over a small hill coverd in pine trees.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first, i thought it was some kind of bird or plane, because i remember seeing something similer a few months back. But there was something different about this object. There was no noise, not even a sound of a car.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Everything just seemed to be still...if anything, that is what i remember most about that night...i couldent even hear our babysitter yelling at us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then it happened, after being still for at least a few minutes, it started to move, but move very slowly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Just gliding from one side for a short distance, stop, and then move to the other.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My younger brother then started yelling with excitement to the babysitter saying &#34;hey, look at that, look up, look up!&#34; Then we all started saying that to the babysitter. Pointing to the thing in the sky but looking at her.<n> <n><n> <n><n> With all the excitement, she looked up, and we knew she saw it because she just stopped with her mouth open and stood there.<n> <n><n> <n><n> But then she smiled adn said that itwas a bird, she had an expression on her face as if thats what she wanted to belive that.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I don&#39;t know about the others, but i know that what we saw that night was no bird.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was to big, to quiet, to visible, and had a unfamilar light about it to be a bird!<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

6/15/81 10:00|Reading (UK/England)||Disk|1 minute|Bright silver disc flying alongside Concorde, before flying off at extreme speed|3/21/03|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/028/S28121.html|25|ndxe198106| Bright silver disc flying alongside Concorde, before flying off at extreme speed<n> <n><n> <n><n> I know this was a long time ago, and I don&#39;t know if it of interest being in the UK.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I cannot remember the exact time or date, as I was only 11 at the time - 23 years ago!  However, I can remember EVERY second of the actual event.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Reading is appx 50 miles west of London, and was on the flight path for Concorde coming into Heathrow.  As it was so close to landing at the time it went overhead, it was very low in the sky, and extremely loud.  Our windows would shake, and phone conversations were impossible for the 20-30 seconds that Concorde was passing overhead.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This particular day was warm, bright blue skies, with a little wispy broken white cloud.  Very clear, very bright.  Myself and appx 5-8 other children were watching Concorde go over, as we always did.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Someone called out:  &#34;What&#39;s that?  Is that a helicopter?&#34; Someone else: &#34;Thats NOT a helicopter!&#34; It was in fact a classic silver disc.  It was flying alongside Concorde (elevations are impossible to judge, but that was the impression).  It flew alongside Concorde, matching it perfectly, for about 30-40 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It then flew off (flew is the wrong term - it shot off like a bullet!) at a right-angle to it&#39;s previous direction of flight.  It flew away and up until it vanished into the clouds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My brother and I have since independently remembered TWO further events (one while we were at dinner with Budd Hopkins at the Leeds UFO conference funnily enough!).  One was a traingle of white lights hovering over the car, and the other was a bright blue sphere hovering over some woods visible from our (shared) bedroom window at 4.01 am in the morning.  Both of these events were since forgotten, and we independently remembered particular details which agreed.  The concorde sighting has always been crystal clear in my memory.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A couple of years ago I was remembering the Concorde event.  Shortly afterwards I returned to Reading to visit relatives.  I bumped into a friend who I hadn&#39;t seen in about 12 years - but I remembered him being there in that playground.  Before we could talk about anything else, I said &#34;This&#39;ll sound weird - do you remember back at Westwood Farm (the school) looking up at Concorde and seeing something?&#34; He instantly said &#34;Yeah - a silver disc that shot off&#34; I replied &#34;Thank you, I didn&#39;t imagine it!&#34;<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((FOLLOW-UP CORRESPONDENCE WITH WITNESS))<n> <n><n> <n><n> Peter,<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thanks very much for coming back to me - I have submitted this report to various places before, but never had a single response!  Thanks.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I will try my best with your questions:<n> <n><n> <n><n> 1)  &#34;At the time of your sighting, which side of the Concorde were you viewing, the right, or left?&#34;<n> <n><n> <n><n> - I was on the ground looking straight up at it as it passed overhead.  EG if I was facing West, it was flying west, and therefore would have been travelling from &#39;behind&#39; us, overhead, and away in front of us into the distance.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 2) &#34;Also, where was the disc, relative to the Concorde, e.g. &#34;above&#34; or &#34;below&#34; the aircraft, as you faced it, or ahead or behind it?&#34;<n> <n><n> <n><n> - It&#39;s hard to judge relative vertical distances from the ground looking straight up.  But the impression that we all had was that it was flying right alongside.  If that was the case, I don&#39;t see how passengers could have missed it!<n> <n><n> <n><n> 3) &#34;In addition, can you provide a detailed description of how the disc moved, relative to the aircraft, i.e. from what direction did it approach; if it hovered close to the aircraft, where was it located; where did the disc go, relative to the flight path of the aircraft?&#34;<n> <n><n> <n><n> - We didn&#39;t see it approach unfortunately.  When we all looked up at the concorde it was already there.  Someone spotted it and said &#34;What&#39;s that? Is that a helicopter?&#34;  Once it had been pointed out it was glaringly obvious, as it was shiny silver.  It flew right alongside the plane, matching it&#39;s speed perfectly, and then flew off very fast at a right angle to it&#39;s previous flight direction.  It may also have been going up at this point, as it disappeared into some clouds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 4) &#34;Also, what was the relative size of the disc, compared, for example to the diameter of the fuselage of the aircraft?&#34;<n> <n><n> <n><n> - I have attached a (very poor - forgive me!) picture which should indicate the relative sizes.  It was considerably smaller than the plane, but still large enough to be clearly seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> I have heard you ask people on the Jeff Rense show to do the arms&#39; length description?  I have tried this, and would estimate that at arm&#39;s length Concorde would have been appx as long as my thumb at the height it was.  It used to go over pretty low!  The picture (sorry again!) shows the size relative to that.  The dotted line is the departure angle it took.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I hope this helps you to get a picture of the event.  I know how hard it is to picture it without seeing it, as it&#39;s so clear to me!<n> <n><n> <n><n> The other witness I have mentioned isn&#39;t really a friend, just someone I was at school with.  Apart from that chance encounter a few years back we&#39;ve never spoken since school.  He was pretty taken aback when this was the first thing I asked him about!  However, I will try my best to find out<n> <n><n> where he is now and ask him to submit a report.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Best regards,  ((name deleted))<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((END))<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We have seen some dramatic video footage of a disc flying beside the Concorde on its maiden flight, although we believe it was taken sometime during July 1976.

I had just crossed I-71 traveling south on rt 123. The weather was good the sky was clear. I was looking south down the road and I noticed a point of light above the horizon, it did not appear to be a star as the light was different clearer and brighter.  It appeared to be a couple miles away I could not tell at this point if it was an aircraft or other, but the road I was on was headed directly towards it. As I drove Through a wooded area I lost sight of the object as I re-emerged from a small ravine back onto a large plateau (which was open) I was much closer to the object and I could tell that it was about 200-300 ft above the ground. At this point all I could make out was a pattern of lights, two in front one in back -like spotlights.  As I got closer the main road took a sharp turn to the right at this point I stopped the car to see if I could tell if it was moving.  It appeared to be hovering in the sky above an empty field. I also noticed that I could not hear any aircraft type noise, even though the car was running. I decided to take a left onto a side road which parelled the field. I drove about 100 yrds. and stopped the car to make sure that it wasn&#39;t moving. It was not, I turned off the car to find out if was making noise- it was not.  I realized that this was something out of the ordinary, I got out of the car and stood next to it and looked up at the object- dead silence.  It appeared as 3 bright white lights- two in front- one in back- hard to say how big- I guess 20yrds long, could not make out a profile.  For some reason I began flashing my car head lights and I blew the horn a couple times. I flashed the lights a number of times and continued to watch the object which did nothing.  Then a rectangular pattern of red lights began to undulate between  the two sets of white lights front to back it did this for about 10 secs. and than began to move up and and away in a north eastern direction at a slow rate of speed.  There was a sound as it! moved l ike rushing air or a muffled jet engine.  That was it- I was pretty shaken up went home and woke my parents to them- I never reported the incidence- This did happen and I would take a polygraph test to prove it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness describes self as having a professional background.

I was driving an 18 wheeler across the Navada desert at around 24:00 hours. The moon was so bright I didn&#39;t need my headlights. I noticed some lights to my right moving my way. I watched the lights move toward me. I just thought it was a helicopter. I had the truck window down and begin to realize I couldn&#39;t hear any noise and the lights were moving closer. Curious I pulled over and stoped the truck. The lights were getting quite close by now and I still couldn&#39;t hear any noise. So I turned the motor off and called to my wife who was sleeping in the sleeper. I got out of the truck and realized that craft was directly above me. The craft set motionlessly about 20 feet above me. The craft was cicular in shape and the edges were curved up like a ball. It was about 100 feet in diameter. The bottom of the craft was made up of hugh metal sheets that looked like they had been exposed to supreme heat. The craft set directly above me for about 5 minutes. The hugh craft hovering silently above me was to much I begin to get scared. As I started to get back in the truck the craft started to move away. As I said before the moon was so bright I could see for miles in the open desert. The craft started moving and within seconds was out of sight. All of this was done without the slightest sound. Unforunatly my wife didn&#39;t wake up fast enought to see the craft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

My dad worked for the Police Dept. and got a call around 10pm that some tourist had seen a UFO near the beach and that they had burned half of their faces off of the reflection from the ice and the UFO. So we hurried in my dad&#39;s car and drove South of where it was reported, and a few minutes later, I watched a red sliver of light hover for a few seconds and then take off straight up and disappear. It never made a sound, and moved so fast and like nothing I had ever seen before.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date in the early 1980&#39;s is approximate.

The ground where it levitated was dry and darker than the area around it. Since i met this sphere i felt that something happened to me. my parents had to buy me a Astrotelescope and i used it everyday to watch the sky in hope to see them again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> i havent talked about this until i was 21 but this event has changed my live.<n> <n><n> <n><n> i saw another sphere/orb when i was at holidays in Egypt in 1993 moving with our plane when we flew back to germany from egypt. The orb flew lower at the same speed as our plane. It was white , bright and it looked like it wasnt moving in the air. no shakes nothing. it wasnt a reflection in the window. other people in the plane saw it too, they tought its a rocket that would shot the plane down and we all would die. I saw this orb when we were over Cairo. The reason i saw it was that i looked at the pyramids.<n> <n><n> <n><n> i known it was something else.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Since these two events happened to me i am extremly interested in Astrophysics, UFOs, Aliens. They changed my live completly. Today i am 42 years old and still waiting for the day to see one of these objects again. They are out there, everyday. Sometimes they come down and we can see them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> best wishes  Andrew Germany<n>

We turned off of No. Bay Dr onto No.Way, we saw what looked like two big flood lights about a mile away on top of the little montain we lived on North of North Bend. As we headed up the inlet my wife or I said something about them maybe doing some hoot owl logging (night logging for cooler and safer temps), and we assumed that was what explained these wierd lights, kind of like head lights, only much brighter.The inlet meanders east of Hwy 101 and we were heading right at the lights which were above this intersection in the mountain. At the bottom of this mountain, most traffic heads to the right, us included, and just a few people live to the left. So as we headed up the inlet and towards the fork in the road, we watched these lights which didn&#39;t seem to move. As we got to with in about a quarter mile, the lights disappered. We were talking about them and had just made this little turn to the right and were straightening out again when this round shape appeared right above us and I stopped the car and got out while my family were sticking there heads out of the windows. This is what happened. I was looking at this round shape with lights all around it and it made no noise. I guess it was 10 or 15 seconds when this craft made declining volume whoosh as it went up and away. It happened my friends and me being a huge skeptic has always put this in the fact column.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

I kept watching as the object approached, (moving very slowly I might add), until it was right in front of us, at a distance of no more than 30 feet, yes, VERY CLOSE to say the least.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object passed right in front of us completly at EYE LEVEL, making NO MISTAKE about what it was that we were seeing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was diamond shaped with a bright white light in the front, a bright red light on the side, and another bright white light in the back. (I never did get to see the opposite side but I assume that it was the same as the side that I could see).<n> <n><n> <n><n> It made absolutely NO SOUND whatsoever, and being THAT CLOSE I was amazed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I honestly started to wave at the object in a welcoming gesture completely unafraid for some reason, hoping that I would get some sort of response from the operators of the flying diamond, however I got no type of recognition that I could see, I was disappointed at that.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object just kept on moving ever so slowly until it just went to a distance of about 1/2 of a mile or so and then just disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have only told a couple of people about the sighting, and one response was that I was seeing a stealth bomber, can you imagine not hearing a stealth bomber at 30 feet away? and not recognizing it? one would have to be blind and an absolute idiot!  Also I was told that I saw a helicoptor, same reasoning, I said to the people that I mistakingly told, &#34;did you not hear what I said that I was only 30 or so feet away from it?&#34; (now I tell no one, this is the only outlet that I have used in many years, keeping this information in is hard)  Since that time I have seen two more sightings, but none as dramatic as that one because of the amount of time that the incident took (around 30 minutes), and also the distance that I was to the sighting, making it as sure as I am about anything that I can see.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am glad to have this chance to get this off my chest, for it is not healthy to keep something like this in, but one cannot talk openly about this type of thing without people saying some stupid remark, so I just keep it to myself.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

On a clear, dark night in June, my friend, who was 12 and I were spending the night in my treehouse. We had decided to go for a walk in the field behind my house. We looked up into the sky and to the North, we saw a yellow-orange colored oval (laying sideways) shaped UFO that was slowly crossing the sky from the East to the West. Four white diamond shaped objects appeared from the tail end of the oval and followed it in a straight line. I remember turning to my friend and asking him if he was seeing what I was seeing. He said that he was and that we weren&#39;t dreaming.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We watched it for about 25 seconds, then while they were traveling, the last diamond object emitted a bright red light and then shot quicky back and downwards in a arc away from the others. The other three then continued moving West in a straight line for a few seconds, then took off at a high rate of speed in different directions.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Following this, the oval object paused for 3 or 4 seconds then shot into the sky at a 45 degree angle at a high rate of speed. We watched it until it went out of site.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))<n>

The North wall in my bedroom was almost all windows and I had a nice view of the canyon wall opposite the one our house was built on. I saw two diamond shaped craft slowly descending vertically, disappearing behind the hill on the other side of the canyon. As they descended they pulsated slowly in unison back and fourth from a bright red to orange in color. As they became bright red, the sky around them glowed giving them an aura. I could clearly see their shape and could tell they were not anything like a plane or helicopter. It looked to me like they were landing and I had an urge to go and investigate, but fear and the fact that it would have been a several hour hike to get to where they were kept me from doing so. I stayed awake for most the night waiting for them to take off and never saw them again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

While in the U.S.M.C. our platoon was out in the field doing our &#34;grunt&#34; training when a fellow Marine shouted out&#34;What the --ck is that&#34;? He pointed to the sky where our Marine pilots just happened to be doing their bomb dropping training missions on the near by mountains out in Camp Pendelton,California.Now remember,we are out in the middle of nowhere with  NO power lines,wires or any thing else that could be blamed for what at least the five surrounding Marines &amp; I saw.(Hell,the whole company could have seen it for all I know.We were pretty scattered about).Any way, I looked up &amp; saw what I will describes as an &#34;Orb&#34;.This is during the day.It was circular &amp; glowing red in color.The more I stared at it I could tell that it was kinda hovering.It seemed to be checking out our jets as they were doing their runs.I could tell how big it was because as I was checking it out one of our jets flew by &amp; this &#34;Orb&#34; blotted out part of the air craft.It was Solid!I would say it&#39;s size was about half the length of the jet.These pilots had to of seen this but you know how that goes.Maybe one of them will see my story &amp; fill in the blanks if he feels secure enough now to do so.Any way,I had to get back to my duties &amp; a short time later I just had to keep looking at it.After a minute or two,from a dead stop hovering in the air,it took off leaving a red trail in the sky.Over the years I have thought how to explain how fast it took off.It basically disappeared except for the red trail it left which did not last long.How fast?If this object was going to fly around this planet we call Earth &amp; I counted to 60, it would have been back!There are other witnesses &amp; those who know me know that I am NOT full of crap &amp; do NOT need to make this up.This was 30 years ago &amp; with my military training &amp; seeing most of what the military had to offer back then it blew me away &amp; still does to this day!Thank You fo! r letting me tell MY story &amp; to ALL the military personnel fro! m ALL br anches &amp; especially my fellow Marines-SEMPER FI!<n>

It should be easy to nail down this date from old records somwhere. The lights in the sky were reported from South Dakota to Kansas, and from Colorado to Iowa. It seemed to me the next day from the radio reports that we were in the center of things, and that what ever direction you went from our point of view most descriptions varied, but none were what we had seen or experienced.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My story: I and a friend had been riding our motorcycles that evening and had returned to my home, a double wide along the Platte River between Columbus and Duncan Ne., shortly before midnight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had been a long day ang we went inside for a short nightcap before my friend was going to head back home to Columbus.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We had just had a different odd experience minutes before we reached my home.<n> <n><n> <n><n> as we turned off hiway 30 onto the blacktop road that led to my place the road suddenly was alive literally thousands of glittering jhewl like things, actually covering the road. It was not long before we realized what we were onto. thousands upon thousands of small toads on the road. I was all we could do to keep from crashing as we mashed though them. We had to ride slowly with our legs extended to stay upright. Not to mention the sound and the splattering all over our bikes and ourselves. Nausiating to say the very least.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I all my years living there, and all the other odd things I have seen and experienced in that area, I had never ever seen that many toads, &amp; green frogs, at one time on the road like that. There could not have been a square foot of open space anywhere on that whole two mile run! Back to the main story: It was after we hosed off the bikes and ourselves that we went into the house for a nightcap. I had borrowed a clean pair of pants to my friend who was prolonging his trek home , in the hopes the mass of creatures would be dissipated by the time he left.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were seated in my dining area by the east window, which was open as were the rest of the windows in the house on that warm midsummer night. It had started to cool slightly but not to a chill as of yet.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had poured a Crown Royal on the rocks for each of us and had no more than taken the first sip,(This I want to make perfectly clear, we had not even had one drink when this happened!),when all went suddenly completly quiet. Till then all the usual night noises were going on as usual. Cows baying in the distance, frogs and crickets, chirping down in the slew. Night hawks, owls ,neibors dogs barking ect... .<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was so sudden and so completely quiet that we locked eyes and and froze for a second or two. When we looked to the window there was a dull red light on the widow sill, and a dull red glow everywhere outside. I leaned over to the window and tryed to look up to see what was causing this but could not see anything.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We got up and went to the bay windows to the south, facing the meadow betwen us and the the tree line along the river bank, about a half mile away. There in the sky, almost directly above us was a ring. It looked like a smoke ring actually. A fat smoke ring , bright white with a red fringe on the edges.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We grabbed a matched pair of my 22 caliber rifles and headed out the  door  down the steps , across the yard , through the slew and about 75 to 100 yards out into the meadow. The hat had not yet been cut and we were knee to hip deep in grass.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The ring was slowly getting larger and thinner directly above our heads. We were trying to figure out what this might possibly be, anthing from a exploded rocket,bomb, metorite,we just did not have a clue.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We watched the ring slowly expand for several minutes. The brightness never dimmed as it got bigger and thinner. As it did this we became aware that although we could see the stars on the outside of the rings all round we could not see any in the black center area of the ring. It was a t this point that we were beginning to get a real creepy feeling about the whole thing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The moon was in plain sight to our southwest, at about a 45 deg. angle to the horizon. Half the horizon away from the ring above our heads.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This whole time not a sound could be heard and it seemed that our words were falling on dead air as well, as if we could not have heard each other had we been only a few more yards apart. Hard to explain! About the time that the ring covered 1/4 or slightly less of the sky area red spears of light started arcing down from the rings outer edge. When these were mabey 1/4 of the way to the ground then white ones did the same spaced evenly between the red. At first we thought that the beams were very high and following the arc of the horizon but when the first ones came down far enough to the ground we could see that the beams were between us and the home place,(My fathers farm about 3/4 mile north of us.), and on the south side seemed to be within the 1/3 mile of tree line along the north river bank.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were in side what I have can only call a cereal bowl effect. Like beeing in a bird cage.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We could see stars between the beams. then a sweet sickening smell was in the air.<n> <n><n> <n><n> it was hard to breeth withthis putred sweet smell. First a pricking static like electricity in the air, then nothing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We both began regaining our senses some time later several tens of yards apart. wet laying in the wet grass,( sitting up actually.) disorientated, at least 2hrs had passed since we first walked outside. All was gone but a hint of the sickening sweet smell.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We made our way back into the house and sat back down on at the table. The ice in our glasses had long melted. The clock read 2:20-somthing. After about an hour my friend left for home.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The next morning on the way to work was the first I heard the radio talk of all the sightings for 500 miles around us in each direction. There were so many different versions, and experts versions all I could do was shake my head. My friend and I worked together, and discussed this only with a shrt list of friends after that.<n> <n><n> <n><n> NOTE: I want absolutly no publicity over this!!! I am relaying this to you hoping mabey that you may have some other info relating to this for me, or some other similar event somwhere else. This is the only reason for any contact I will accept.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The only contact with me is though my e-mail, thank you.<n> <n><n> <n><n> p.s. I and my father had a sighting when I was about 10 yrs old at the farm.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Since I have had three others, each different, one was simply spotting a oval shped object passing from a cloud though open blue sky and into or behind another cloud, only this this was reflecting the color of the sky behind it. It did not change from the white color to match the blue sky right away and that is how I caught sight of it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> this was about two years ago heading east on hiway 33 west of Crete ne.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The other was summer 2000,.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had taken my 12 year old daughter out with me to star gaze on the hill behind the lake community where we live. I have beendoing this periodically for years, yet had never seen anything. This was the first time I had let her stay up this late to go with me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We had been there for about 15-20 minutes, and she was already whining about going back when we saw two objects comming our direction from the northwest.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There is a gravel road about 1/3 mile west of us. You can here the gravel crunching under a cars tires from where we were.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The objects each had a bank of 5 lights in front of them. One was following the other just behind and to the west. They crossed the road west of us and the lights lit up the road like search lights. I thought they were helicopters untill they got that close and made no sound at all. All we could see was the lights because they were so bright. They passed us less than 1/4 mile away to the north and dipped down out of sight in the valley northof us. A few minutes later they popped up several miles north headed west this tim and then dipped down out of sight again. Even looking with binoculars at them as they were headed away we could not make out any shape of a craft. Just after they dipped out of sight the first time a car passed on the gravel road with the radio blairing and we could hear that well.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This happened about 5 miles north of Crete ne. at about 10:30 pm on a wednsday night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> That is all I have to report. Pardon any tyo&#39;s I am doing this fast as I am @ work.<n>

I Just seen the show, as I watch just about EVERY UFO show I can &amp; have ever since my sighting.  I realize 23 years is a long period of time to go by, but I tell you something thats true..I cant remember alot of things that goes on in my life, but I remember this experience as it were yesterday.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My father was in the Air Force for 30 years, therefore I know what an airplane looks like...I also know what helicopters &amp; hueys look like...I know what our US aircrafts look look like.  I was made to go to mannnny an airshow...I guess Im trying to make someone believe me as ive only told a handful of people my story...my dad being the last as I didnt think he&#39;d take me seriously....<n> <n><n> <n><n> anyway..I was 15.  My dad was in Korea for a year &amp; my older sister just got a new boyfriend &amp; they decided to take a walk one night...they wouldnt allow me to go with them, so I decided to sit on his (my sisters boyfriends) motorcycle &amp; wait for their return...i was alone in the yard ...&amp; something made me turn my head &amp; when i did I seen this craft so to speak hovering over the trees of my neighbors yard...hovering...as if looking at me! I didnt hear it come...&amp; i promise u it was looking at me...I was like in a trance for...well I dont know how long for...I dunno how much time passed before i seemed to tear away as I wanted my mom to see it...maybe 30 seconds passed after i tore away...long enough to run up the stairs on the porch &amp; yell loud enough to get my mom &amp; brother out to look...by then it was gone...( no noise as it left)..didnt hear it come...didnt hear it go..over the years my mom kinda just acted like she believed me, but before my father died (&amp; I knew he was going to die as he had cancer), I finally told him the story, thinking he would tell me it was nonsense etc...but he didnt ...he told me a story about he was in a watch tower somewhere &amp; there was a call to him about an aircraft or something &amp; no one seen it on the radar &amp; they were all confused about it-they had a sighting too-I also explained to him what i&#39;d seen &amp; he knew every aircraft aswell...(mind u i live near an airforce base) &amp; he just couldnt explain it-he knew of some craft that could hover but not without sound...<n> <n><n> <n><n> anyway sir...what i seen was not from this world-I promise you that...I dont think i was abducted but they did have me hyptonized maybe? anyway it was a gray craft, with red lights not blinking I&#39;ll never forget it for the rest of my life-I keep looking everyweek for a return yet ive not been lucky...or unlucky...I dunno if they are friendly or not...but if i had to say one or the other i&#39;d say unfriendly..<n> <n><n> <n><n> Please take my story serious...I will take 50 lie detector tests to prove i know what i seen &amp; it wasnt from here! Thank you for your time...<n> <n><n> <n><n> Sincerely...yes  ((name deleted)) everyone!<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of the event is approximate; provides no contact information.

I was 4-5 years old, lying in bed staring out the window up at the night sky, when I noticed an object circling above. It was boomerang-shaped, golden, and circling the duplex my family lived in and the home next door. After watching for a while, I got out of bed to tell my dad (who was watching the late news) about the &#34;ghost bird&#34; flying above the house. He told me to go back to bed. When I did, it had left. However, I woke up later on in the night, and it had returned. I called it the &#34;ghost bird&#34; for a long time, until I found out about UFOs. I hope this helps.

The three of us looked in the direction of the Ocean just three blocks away and saw what appeared to be a large object glowing white and looking like a minature moon , moving from our right to our left going in the direction of Allbrook Airforce Base, moving at approx 50 or so miles an hour and then went out of our sight. Afew minutes later a foot patrolman came by and asked if we had seen anything strange staating that the switch board had been going crazy with calls, told him our experience and he went hi way.

The object proceeded to move upward and at that point I knew it wasn&#39;t a cruise ship because I could see the ocean and the sky seperated underneath the ship.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The craft then proceeded to move upward  and move slowly in a triangular shape in the same area.  It was more diamond shaped and had an off white or cream color with 2 rows of green lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At that point I turned to my mothers room which I could see into from the balcony and told my mom to wake up and come look at this thing floating above the water.  By the time my mom got up and looked it was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> If I had to make a comparison as far as size I&#39;d say as big as a cruiseship.  I went to school and told my classmates about what I saw and they all laughed at me so I stopped talking about it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))<n>
