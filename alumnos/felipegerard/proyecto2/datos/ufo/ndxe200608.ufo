8/31/06 21:30|Mount Shasta|CA|Triangle|5 seconds|low flying, dark,  large car sized triangle with rectangle dim lights|10/30/06|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/052/S52372.html|1|ndxe200608| low flying, dark,  large car sized triangle with rectangle dim lights<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was just about dark when I was on my back porch hanging out clothes. I was looking up as if viewing the 3 story apartment house&#39;s roof to the NW of me.  Right over my head flew a dark triangle just over my back porch and the roof of the 3 story apartment building.  It was a short view due to the size of the building NW (next lot)of me and not quite fully dark yet.  A more detailed map with drawing will be submitted as an update when I can.  It came into my view as it passed over my head look toward and above the 3 story apartment building NV of me. It was a dark, triangle craft, about the size of an old caddilac car.  There were dim, rectangle shaped lights from the point to the back, but not across the back.  Stranger yet was that there was one more light on the left size than the right side, like one light was out. It was about a 4/5 second sighting. I won&#39;t forget it.  I screamed for my roommate to come see, then passed him on my way back through the house to get outside to try and see past the bigger building. A street light, made further viewing impossible, past the larger building. It was moving along 15/20 mph basically paralelling I-5 from North Mt Shasta, towards, if it kept along that flight line, to the NW of Black Butte, to the town of Weed, Ca.  I would think that cars on I-5 may have been able to see it. I didn&#39;t think until later that I should have called Weed PD to look for it coming.  There was no noise, no engine seen, and it was too slow and quiet to be any sort of military or regular small plane I&#39;ve ever seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

While attempting to make a phone call I began staring at the moon (it was waxing at a half crescent).  I cancelled the call and scrolled the sky until I was at about an 80 degree angle just north of the moon.  A brighter than usual star (maybe -1 mag.) caught my attention.  It was moving east to west at a fairly high rate of speed.  It was circular in shape and white in color.  There was no trail what so ever.  I assumed it was a satellite and decided to watch it until it disappeared from the horizon.  After several seconds I was astonished.  The object slowed and than at that instant, it made a 90 degree direction change and accelerated to an astonishing speed.  It was out of sight in a second or fraction of.  As for my background, I have a BS in biology and chemistry and currently work as an analytical chemist for a local company.  I have NEVER experienced any &#34;sightings&#34; before and though I support MUFON (probably the only Louisiana member) I am a scientist and I try to take an unbiased look at everything.  In the case of this sighting, scientifically, it could have possibly been a meteor being &#34;deflected&#34; in the atmosphere but there was NO BURN TRAIL and the way it varied its speed was just remarkable.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Artificial satellites do not have a westerly component to their groundtrack, so the object could not have been a satellite, if the estimate of direction by the witness is correct.  PD))<n>

It seemed to bright to be a star and did not move.  The view through 4x30 bioculars did not change the objects appearance much.  Soon however, it dimmed to about half it&#39;s original brightness and eventually split in two. The two hazy blobs soon dissapeared. It was the color of a star.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

As I was stretching I noticed movement in the sky. At first I thought that it was a bird catching the reflection off of the stadium lights from the nearby college. As I watched more intently I noticed lights on the bottom of the object that appeared to merge from one color to the next. The object was diamond shaped and moved rapidly in several directions. The movement was dramatically faster than anything that I have seen in my military experience recently in Operation Iraqi Freedom. The object was changing direction in a short period of time and then shot straight up in the air and disapeared. My wife was freeked out when I told her. It is now 21:23 so this happend just moments ago. I only wish that I had a camera.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was above the 18-story building that fills 2/3rds of the view of my window.  It was traveling to my right from the time I first saw it and going in the direction of near south Chicago.  It was oval-shaped, 1/4&#34; to 1/2&#34; at arms-length, had no visible wings, moved as though it were floating on top of water, in a horizontal direction (i.e., did not ascend like a balloon would), and had a yellow hue.  It was moving away from me, so it was getting smaller, and then I lost it behind a building and in the gray clouds.  I called the lady who sits next to me to watch it, and she agreed that it was unidentifiable.  We watched it for about 30 seconds before we lost it behind the building.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Then, it went out. At first, I thought it was a tower but then realized there were no towers out there. There isn&#39;t anything on 27. I then thought it was a plane, but it was much too bright and too low. It was oval in shape. It was moving rather slowly, not much at all. It got brighter and I passed it and when I looked in my rear-view mirror, it was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I looked up in the night sky, and to the north there were three lights that appeared accompanied by the sound of a jet. They appeared small at first but they grew a bit larger, it looked like street lights in the sky. they were orange and oval in shape. The lights were in a horizontal row with the middle light a little lower than the other two. They appeared not to be too high in the sky. The light in the middle went back and fourth between the other two. The two outer lights faded out and then the middle one did. About 15 to 30 minutes later another light showed up just west of where the others had been. It seemed like there were many planes in the sky with their searchlights on, but I could not tell if they were planes for sure.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was very dissapointed that I could not find my camera to show others what I had seen. I really was sceptical until last night. Now I really feel that there very well could be something out there.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous;  provides no contact information.  PD))<n>

They appeared about 8-10 times over the period of the hour we sat out. The glowing lights were about 1/3 the size of a moon, but possible haze could have magnified them. They would appear for 3-7 secs. , then dissappear. At times three were in a line while another was on the horizon. Most of the sightings were about at 40 degrees. I asked other hotel guests and even asked a policeman, but no one heard anything or witnessed them.<n>
8/29/06 20:35|Lincoln|NE|Light|1 minute|I tracked a brilliant orange pulsating light moving slowly and silently for a minute, then saw it disappear.|10/30/06|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/052/S52259.html|11|ndxe200608| I tracked a brilliant orange pulsating light moving slowly and silently for a minute, then saw it disappear.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Leaving the Gere Public Library at 8:35 pm, I saw what seemed at first to be a brilliant orange star in the lower eastern sky.  At that time, only the moon and a few of the brightest stars were visible (the moon was in the western sky opposite from this anomalous light). What caught my eye at first was the unusual orange tint, and as I trained my eyes on it, I saw it was moving slowly westward in my general direction. I wondered whether it could be a plane on a landing approach, but there was no noise and instead of having blinking navigational lights, the light intensity fluctuated (growing gradually brighter and then gradually dimmer every second or two). I continued to watch this pulsating orange light for about a minute, then it suddenly dimmed and disappeared completely. That struck me as very odd, since the sky was without a cloud that evening. I searched that area of the sky for another couple of minutes but the object didn&#39;t re-appear. Several other people were nearby, but apparently I was the only one there who noticed this anomolous light. As the light periodically brightened, it would become several times brighter than any star or planet in the sky at that time, including Sirius and Venus, which were also visible during this sighting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am a research scientist and medical writer (50 years of age).  I&#39;ve been skeptical of UFOs most of my life. This is the first time that I&#39;ve ever seen an unidentied flying object.<n>

We both noticed them at the same time and tried to figure out what they could be.  We named every possible flying object and discounted every single thing that it could have been.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were facing south, and they were to the west of us flying south. They were at a distance of about 150 to 200 yards away. They slowed down and then hovered in one area for a few seconds then turned and faced west and started to fly west.  But when they turned, the triangular shaped objects became &#34;sliver like&#34; thin, except the ball shaped object, and continued on.   About the time when they were almost out of our view, we were surprised to see another strange triangular shaped object with something hanging from it, just beneath it.  We thought it might have been an &#34;ultralight&#34; singleman plane with someone sitting in the seat below the wing, but quickly dismissed due to the fact that it was beginning to become dark outside, and the fact that small air crafts like &#34;ultralights&#34; are not allowed in the city.  And we had just had a light rain storm in some areas of the city with lightning reported in other areas with no rain.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Near my house the sky was green with no rain or lightning. (My house was about the same area where the objects would have been flying over.)  They also made no sound, and flew very slow and uniform.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My friend and I are still very perplexed over what we both witnessed and wondered if anyone else saw the objects too.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It seemed to be at a very high altitude, much higher than any of the whispy clouds in the sky that day and this thing was moving FAST.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It made no sound, which I thought was odd, since I live out in the country and you can always hear planes flying overhead, and it left no trail.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;d say it was probably a metallic-silver in color, and may have had a haze around it, but it was hard to tell if it was emitting its own light or if it was reflecting the light from the sun.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I watched it travel all the way across the sky that was visible to me, until it went behind a cloud and the trees were in the way to see it any longer.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Immediately after I lost sight if the object, a large jet flying at a very low altitude went past, traveling almost the same course, only going south/south-east.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The oddest thing about the whole experience it that when I was 10, I saw an almost identical object in Wisconsin Dells, only about 8 miles away from this sighting.  That objest was much lower in the sky, but it was the same sphereical shape, and that one was definately a dark silver color, and it was hovering in one spot before completely disappearing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I told my parents about that I was told it was probably a weather balloon or just my imagination...but now I can positively say that is NOT what I saw...<n>

I was driving and saw the object above trees moving steadily south.  It was NOT ascending as all planes from airport would be.  It was somewhat longer than it was high, no lights, it was daytime. It dissapeared from my sight as the trees obscured it. It may have entered the low clouds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Did not see it as we passed the trees nor was any plane visable at the moment. Turned car around and was back at the same spot shortly looking for perhaps a tethered balloon, but there was none.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous;  provides no contact information.

Bozeman Montana.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Skies, Clear, Cloudless Night. Temperature 40 degrees.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was camping, with sleeping bag only, behind a burm in a grass-less construction lot.  It was about a quarter mile square.  Mall to the south, treeline to the north, townhouses to the east and the highway to the west.  I was told later that there is a military base of some kind near this location.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 12:30 AM While camping out in an empty dirt lot behind Bob Wards Sporting Goods noticed what thought was a plane or planet (too low to be a star), blue-white. It began blinking/flashing noticed several other blinking/flashing objects low in the night sky as well. There is an airport in Bozeman so figured it was a few airplanes, but kept looking anyway. This went on for some time, I&#39;m guessing 15 minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 12:45 AM Suddenly one of these &#34;planes&#34; began to move through sky at will, whimsically even--gaining losing elevation, making impossibly sharp turns. The flashing became frenetic. Then other two flashing objects began moving similarly. They behaved like this for about 30 minutes. They disappeared searched sky but they were nowhere to be found  2:15 AM After an hour searching sky my heart slowed down and I decided to turn over go to sleep. 3 &#34;meteors&#34; streaked from sky (west to east) to the ground behind some new townhouses, one-at-a-time in short intervals. &#34;Okay,&#34; I said to myself, &#34;I&#39;m awake again.&#34; I kept watching the townhouses. In a few minutes I noticed movement around the townhouses and 20 feet above townhouses, two unrecognizable shapes (because they were dark against a night blue sky) moving silently in a circular fashion. Gradually they began to emit light began to see them clearly. My neck hair was standing on end.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 2:25 AM They were two, sometimes three playfully eminating, green, misty, dancing globes above aforementioned townhouses almost cracked a smile watched dancing lights until they stopped, just before sunrise.<n> <n><n> <n><n> *That was it for that night.***  I camped here for the next couple days. I saw the dancing lights above the town houses every night. Then on the last night I was to camp here, I was watching the dancing lights and suddenly a room in townhouse was brightly illuminated for a fraction a second, as if someone had a flash light (stark, cold blue-white light), then another, in sequence--as if someone was going room-to-room. But quicker than a human could run to each room. I wondered if there was anyone living there and hoped they were alright. There were cars parked out front, but no sign of human activity. I wondered if this was some kind of signal. I was afraid.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 3:00 AM It took me a while to calm down but, I turned over, my back to the townhouses and tried to sleep. I looked out toward the treeline. Trees relax me. That&#39;s when a red light amidst the trees turned on at ground level. I figured it was the brake lights of a car. The light slowly and silently rose 15 feet into the air paused and began moving toward the highway, dispelling that thought. &#34;Okay, it&#39;s a helicopter far away, it&#39;s just further away than I think it is&#34; I told myself. I kept listening for rotor wash. I heard none and under close observation I could tell it was in the stand of trees and I knew there couldn&#39;t be a helipad behind a landscaping company. By this red light reached the edge of the stand of trees. I was on my feet, putting my shoes on, I was really scared and wasn&#39;t sticking around for this, but I couldn&#39;t take my eyes off of it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 3:10 AM It hovered there momentarily. Then a white light seemed to turn on, but I realized that this object had simply begun to rotate. It kept rotating slowly and began a slow pass of the field along the highway edge. I knew it was a triangle now because I could see it&#39;s bottom now. It had 3 lights, 2 white-ish and one red. Before I could collect my things it was directly over my head not more than 20 feet in the air. I could see it&#39;s shape clearly now; only because it blacked out the stars as it went. It was a triangle with rounded corners. About 20 feet on a side. It did not stop as I recall. Slowly spinning and swinging it&#39;s course around me, as if to say hello then off in the direction of the town houses. As it passed I noticed a low-rumbling sound, like a muffled V-8 at idle.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 3:12 AM That&#39;s when I ran. I ran as hard as I could with 60 pounds on my back in the opposite direction and hitch hiked out of there.<n> <n><n> <n><n> If anyone has information on this or has seen anything like it PLEASE contact me ASAP! Thank you.<n>

I took a few pictures, and one shot I took facing N/NE I saw a lightning fast streak, and at the time I didn&#39;t think anything of it.  I thought it was nothing and maybe the altitude and being winded that my eyes were playing tricks on me.  I got home later that night and uploaded my pictures I took that day and spotted something in the photograph that might have been what I thought I saw.  I really didn&#39;t know what to do with the photo, or bother with it, and I&#39;d just show friends the picture.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The background of the picture is right at the edge of the blast zone of Mt St Helens and you can see in the photograph where the forest was blown over and where the forest was unharmed.

I took the picture with a Nikon coolpix 4600 with 4.0 megapixels and I had the camera at about half an arm lengths away from my face so when I took the photo and when I did I saw a streak, and that was it.  I didn&#39;t hear anything and I didn&#39;t see anything else. but I didn&#39;t think to look for anything because I didn&#39;t think I saw anything, the incident was that quick.<n>

As I passed Starr Motors, I noticed a bright green object flash across the sky. The object moved rather quickly and left a huge green trail that lit up the sky.

We were camped near an old Single lane suspension bridge, over the American River.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had decided to sleep outside my tent, under the stars, while everybody else slept in tents.  At about 12:30 I noticed an object with four lights move over the top of one side of the river canyon. the lights were in a diamond shape and bright red, not flashing, not changing.  The object moved unusually slowly over the river canyon, and apeared to be no more than 50 feet over the tops of the hills.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object took about 2min to cross over from one hill top to another, a distance of about 2-3 football fields.

The sky was partly cloudy. I glanced up facing south for a moment and noticed a bright flash of light as if some one was using a photographic flash from inside or above the clouds. At first I just thought it was the landing headlights of a plane. Less than a second later there was two more flashes to the left and a bit south of the other flash. The flashes appeared to be beamed downward. Two more flashes appeared from the first location a few seconds later. Then two flashes from the other location, left and south. It almost seemed like they were signalling each other. The flashes were stationary and appeared brighter but more dispersed as the clouds thickened. As the clouds thin, the light was still bright but more concentrated like spotlight or camera flash. On two occaissions abeam of light shot through the clouds horizontally and travelled quite a distance. I tried photographing and videoing the lights but was unable to capture the scene. I also used binoculars but was unable to see any solid objects. This went on for more than an hour. I couldn&#39;t think of anyone to call to witness, the event at first. I noticed my neighbor was still awake so I emailed her. She came over to see what I was describing, but the lights had stopped. I thought it might be a reflexion of light from the city of Detroit but the the light was more concentrated from the center or above the cloud and seemed to widen as it got closer to the bottom of the cloud.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

About 5 miles from the city of Grants Pass I saw a bright, white light, round and some sort of rotation of the light shining over the tree tops. It appeared to be coming from below the object. The light was not shining above, as if a helicopter was searching the ground with a huge light except the light was moving in a circular movement. Light very white bright. I was driving and kept looking behind me and could see the light still rotating and lighting up the trees. The light which looked like a giant spot light was above the tree tops, maybe 500 ft.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

As we were looking at different WebPages something caught our attention. It was a bright orb outside of our window, I thought it might be a reflection of some kind so I opened the window but the object was still there.  It was a yellow sphere that remand stationary and then it just &#34;zipped&#34; (for the lack of a better word) and it disappeared out of my view in less than half of a second.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

We were near Federal Way before mile marker 149.  After looking at a map, I would say that the object fell noth / northwest of Federal Way.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As the object fell, it left a long green trail.  I would approximate the color green to that of a stoplight.  Due to the fact that we were driving on the freeway at the time, it was difficult to gauge the distance and location of the object, but I would say it was large and far away.  As there was also air traffic in the area, at first we thought something must have fallen from a plane, but ruled that out, as we both saw it as being much further away than the planes landing at SeaTac Airport.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first we thought it was just a meteor or a shooting star, however, this object fell in a near vertical path, as we viewed it from the south looking north.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Out of the west I notice a rather large very bright circular light approaching out of the west.  It is on a straight path about the height an airliner would be on, a high flying airliner, heading from west to east.  In the binoculars [8X42] there are no blinking lights, only a steady light, very bright and a white / blue tint color.  The speed estimation is about what an airliner would travel at this point.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I follow it&#39;s flight as it nears a spot directly opposite [north] of my location the light changes to a smaller shape, but still round and whiteish/ blueish.  Continueing east it increases its speed and the white circle changes to an orange or red dot, and smaller in size.  Still viewing in the binocs the dot is definitely accelerating away from me on the same direct line.  This intrigues me and I continue to watch for another few seconds when the dot just vanishes right before my eyes.  It just was gone, I had a clear view of the night sky and it just sped away and vanished with no trace.  There was never any sound associated with the object.  In my opinion an airliner would have been audible at that distance.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I witnessed other lights that were airliners before and after this sighting.  I could here engine whine.  This light was unlike anything I have ever witnessed skywatching.  Would like to hear from others who may have witnessed this.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My postion is in north Seattle, the object passed north of me approximately 5 miles.  This is just an estimated guess.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

At first I thought it was a bright star, as I watched it I noticed it was changin colors in quick flashes from red to blue to bright white.  I called my roommate out to take a look.  We got the binoculars out to take a closer look.  We could see the distinct changing of color and the shape of the object (triangular shaped)  We watched for approximately 2 hours as it slowly moved toward the horizon and we could no longer see it.  Very strange.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

At times they would all disappear only to reappear slowly one at a time, but always appear in the same general area.  From my terrace on a hill, I could see them dance about very clearly.

So with all of that the being told me it turned and went quietly back to the ship and the 3 took off but not before a goodbye light show.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Suddenly,a formation of 7 or 8 boomerang or arrowhead shaped objects appeared,flying north to south,from over our garage roof. The appearance was so striking and strange that each of us instinctively jumped out of our chair and actually stumbled over one another to get a longer look before they disappeared over our house and into the distance. They disappeared incredibly fast despite their altitude,we just looked at each other and said &#34;did you see that&#34;? They were brighty lit in a way I would describe as similar to a child&#39;s glowstick (white),appeared to be flying in synch with one another,in a V or L shaped formation,and appeared to be part of or lights on a larger transparent object. It appeared to be flying an altitude approximately that of a helicopter;lower than a commuter plane. I am considerably versed in existing and historical military aircraft, but this one has me baffled. It is definately a &#34;UFO&#34; sighting in my books.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

We were sitting watching television and all of a sudden outside our living room window we saw two fireball shaped lights just beyond the roof of the house next door.  What I saw was the balls of light zig zag down into view and then zip out of sight heading northwest. The objects were big and close and the movement would have made me think it was a bird or something, if it wasn&#39;t so clearly a ball of light about the size of a streetlamp maybe or a large softball.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My husband saw the lights as bluish green and from his position in the room and he only saw them pass by the window.  We both jumped up but whe we got to the window there was nothing there.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About 30 minutes later my husband saw 2 separate red lights, further in the distance, arc across the sky in the shape of a question mark (from top to bottom) and then disappear. The red lights appeared about a minute apart and also had the smooth fluid movement of the fireballs.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

THE TWO RED ON TOP AND THE TWO WHITE ON THE BOTTOM, LIKE A SQUARE. AT THAT POINT I CALLED MY BROTHER WHO SAW THE SAME THING.WE THEN SAW THE CRAFT START FLASHING RAPID COLORS,RED,GREEN, BLUE,ORANGE,YELLOW.THIS WAS VERY STRANGE BECAUSE A.) YOU COULD SEE IT WITH THE NAKED EYE AND THE LIGHTS STARTED TAKING SHAPES. OBLONG,ROUND,SQUIGGLEY. MY BROTHER WAS LOOKING THROUGH THR BINOCULAR&#39;S AND SEND &#34;OH MY GOD&#34; THERE ARE TWO MORE ON EITHER SIDE OF HIM. THEY WERE MUCH SMALLER BUT ALSO USING COLORS.THEN I SAW A LARGE BEACON OF LIGHT THAT LOOKED TO BE COMMING FROM MOFFAT AIR FORCE BASE. THE UFOS STARTED FLASHING FASTER AND FASTER.THE TWO SMALLER ONES FLEW ABOVE THE LARGE ONE MAKING A PERFECT TRIANGLE.THERE WAS MORE COLORED LIGHTS FLASHING FROM ALL THREE.THEN THE TWO SMALL ONES JUST DISSAPPEARED. THE LARGE ONE STOPPED ALL THE COLOR FLASHES.THEN THERE WERE TWO BRIGHT FLASHES  AND THE CRAFT WAS GONE. THE INTERESTING THING ABOUT THIS ALSO WAS THAT THERE WAS NOT ONE PLANE IN SIGHT THE WHOLE THIRTY MINUTES. THIS FLIGHT PATH IS ONE OF THE BUSIEST FOR SFO AIRPORT.

PD))|10/30/06|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/052/S52230.html|44|ndxe200608| Extremely bright, steady  light moving across night sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My two sons and I plus our neighbor&#39;s son (7,5,6, respectively) planned to watch the sky for meteors on that Saturday night.  We live in Fall City, a small rural community about 25 miles east of Seattle in the Cascade foothills.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We set up a tent, got our sleeping bags, pads, snacks, etc., and waited for dark - we had planned this for the previous week or so.  The moon is dark and sky was beautifully clear.  We were having a great time - saw 2 satellites and at least two shooting stars.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At about 9:40 p.m., my 7 year old declared that he was tired and went into the house.  About 5 minutes later, my 5 year old yelled look at that light (not star.)  The neighbor boy and I looked to the Northeast and saw a large, intense, white light moving from NW to SE.  The light was far brighter than any stars in the sky and was moving at a very deliberate pace - it took the light about 10-15 seconds to cross about 2/3&#39;s of our field of vision i.e. from the time we saw it until it went behind some adjacent trees.  I could not tell how high it was, but it appeared to be quite high up.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was no sound whatever and we live in a very quiet area.  At first I thought &#34;airplane.&#34;  But as I observed it, I came to the conclusion that it was not an airplane, certainly not any airplane I had ever seen before.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The light looked round and about the size of a BB if you hold it at arm&#39;s length.  It was a very clear, very steady white/blue color.  It did not blink, flicker, or attenuate in any way.  I was very impressed with the &#34;steadiness&#34; of the light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It moved, as I noted above, very deliberately. That is the only way I can think to describe it.  The speed didn&#39;t appear to vary and it didn&#39;t appear to turn or change course in any way.  I know this must sound like a terrestrial aircraft of some sort, but I don&#39;t believe it was.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was like a very large star moving through the sky, very bright, very intense, very very impressive.  It was not a meteor, at least not like one I&#39;ve ever seen before.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am a geologi! st and have spent a great deal of time in remote areas and have observed the night sky constantly.  I have never seen anything like this before.  I do not drink or take drugs, ever.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My son and his buddy saw the same thing and we compared notes afterward.  I looked at my watch just as it went out of sight so that I would have a time reference.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am really interested to see if anyone else saw this object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This was a cool experience.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Possible sighting of ISS.

8/26/06 03:30|Atlantic Ocean (in flight)||Light|5 min.|Bright light, changing colors, sitting still in the sky for 3-4 minutes and then moving slowly and disapperaing in front of our plane.|10/30/06|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/052/S52498.html|50|ndxe200608| Bright light, changing colors, sitting still in the sky for 3-4 minutes and then moving slowly and disapperaing in front of our plane.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This observation was made sitting in a Boeing 757 (Continental Airlines), flying from Newark, NJ, to Stockholm, Sweden. Our altitude was 35,000 ft. Around 3:30 (UTC) I observed a bright light at 10 o&#39;clock. The light was at a somewhat higher altitude and was seemingly sitting still in the sky. First I thought it was another airplane heading toward us with its lights on. I then noticed that the brightness of the light was slowly fluctuating and also changing colors from white (clear)-red-blue-green-white. No flashing lights (like on an airplane) were observed and no shape of the object. I took a digital picture of the light. Since it was dark outside the exposure time was long, so the camera moved while I was taking the picture. This caused the light to &#34;draw&#34; an irregular line on the picture, which makes it possible to see on the picture that the brightness and colors of the object were shifting continuosly. Less than one minute after I took the picture our plane started to climb up to 39,000 ft and changing the course more to the right (away from the object). This made the object &#34;move&#34; to a position at 9 o&#39;clock, where it stayed for a minute or two. Then it started to move slowly to the right until it disappeared in front of our plane. Still at i higher altitude. It was impossible to see how far away from the plane this object was, but I am sure it was a few miles. This happened almost exactly two hours before landing at Stockholm Airport (7:30 local time) and the position was due west of the Farøe Islands, which I saw from the airplane approx. 30 minutes after the observation.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have been working on the railroad for many years as Locomotive Engineer and Road Foreman.

I could see the glow from the heat when the lights turned off. I also looked under the craft briefly as it passed over us, it didn&#39;t have any characteristics of a helicopter nor any sound for being so close to our car. A couple more started circling around us while one got behind us and followed us for a awhile. The driver thought we were getting pulled over for a second because the lights were so bright and were at the same level of our car.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

There was a difference in color but the observer is from Midland, which is fairly close to my location.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My first sighting was driving home from a friends&#39; house around 1am and had pulled off a dirt road onto a paved road. Right away I noticed something in the upper left corner of my front window. I assumed it was a bat or hawk due to it&#39;s rotating motions. A minute or so down the road I was wondering why it would stay with me and at the same spot. I then noticed when the trees along side of the road came it would disapear from view and then come back into view when trees weren&#39;t there. I dimmed my lights thinking I had something lose or broken in them, it was still there. I was now almost half a mile from my house and had slowed down to 20mph watching the object. At this point I was scared, I almost missed turning into my drive way and when I did I pulled right next to the front door to my house. I gathered my house keys and opened my car door quickly. When I closed my car door I looked behind me (Dirrect East) and saw it was a white, oval shape and always moved in a large circle. The color was about the same as the stars, maybe a bit brighter, only white that I could see. This was the first time I could clearly see it and not doubt myself on what it was. I ran to my door, put in my key, went into my bed room and sat on the bed. I had never experienced anything like it before, so I was very scared. I kept thinking I am your friend I won&#39;t hurt you, I wanted them to know I would befriend them or something. I did feel a numbish comforting feeling, though I layed awake for 2 hours before falling to sleep.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My second sighting I was driving home from my girlfriends house, at least a week or more had went by. I had been looking for it every night, but had no luck. This night I thought was the same, I pulled in my usual parking spot further from my front door. When I got out of my car I looked up and there it was! I ran to the house door, but curiousity compeled me to watch it. I stayed there, watching it for about an hour before I was shivering. I then hurried in my house, grabbed a coat and came back out, it was still in the same place. It would always move in circles, maybe this was how it stayed in flight. I would say every 2 or 3 seconds it would revovle. I gained courage to walk out back to my car, then to the back door to my house. It moved a bit as if following me. I then walked to garage, barn, camper, and start of field which it always would follow me. I looked back towards my house and saw a light, so someone else was up. I walked back up to the house thinking now that it would not go away if I went back inside. My grand father was awake and I had him come out in his underware just to see it. He was in the seventh army anti-aircraft and had a better perception of it&#39;s distance then I. He said it appeared to very high up, which I had thought it was lower and very small. Being high up made more logic and I realized that it was probably a more reasonable explaination. He went inside after about 20 minutes and I followed. I told him I wanted to walk out into the field and see how far it would follow me. He told me to be safe and take his truck, so I did. I drove around our hay fields for a few laps at low speed watching it follow me. It always stayed on the east side of me. I felt like I should go to our back field down a two trail through the woods, but I think I was too scared. I ended up comming back to the house and parking the truck. I then watched it until 5:30am or so when I felt the need to sleep. I went to my door and waved good bye, hoping I would see it again another night. While I got ready ! to go to bed, I looked out the window several times until about 6am and it was still outside. I hope to see the object again, which I believe is a UFO. To add, both nights were very clear skys though I cannot recall seeing the moon. From my house door the object looked to be telephone pole hight, maybe a bit higher, but was very small about size of hand. I would guess it was very high, but I don&#39;t know if you could calculate angles some how to find out. If you need more inforation please let me know. The sighting has really made me rethink life and realize that the unbelievable could really be true. I hope that people can take the time to read my incounter and believe in it. I now have a video camera ready and waiting so if I am lucky and this &#34;UFO&#34; allows me to I will hopefully be able to record it. Unforunitly I can&#39;t afford to stay awake every night to look for it, but I try to look out the window whenever I can or look in the sky when I drive home.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.

Whatever it was looked brilliant, a silver white light.  The shape varied in it&#39;s dimensions.  At that point I was trying to figure out what I was looking at, when it just blinked out!  Then came back in about a second, a good distance from where I first saw it.  I was amazed at how fast it had moved! I&#39;d never seen anything like this in the 25 years driving on weekend nights after work. Then it blinked out again and I lost it. I continued to look as I drove but never saw it again.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

We had been observing the stars, the ocean, and my two friends were using their metal detector. My female friend and I had decided to sit down and talk, while the other male friend used his metal detector. We both had been looking up towards the sky for about fifteen minutes. I saw an object appear out of no where that looked like a flare in the sky but was very high up, higher than a flare would be and it&#39;s color was white, it was very bright and large. After the object flared, it then looked like it disappeared. My friend was talking and I asked her if she saw the same thing. She said she saw something out of the corner of her eye. About five minutes later the object reappeared. My friend and I both saw it together that time. It flared out again, the same white color, it then looked like it disappeared, then it became smaller, it looked circular then and had a slight white luminescent edge around it&#39;s circular shape. The middle of the object was dark. We watched it until it finally disappeared which was about a minute or so. We watched the sky for a while then decided to watch the sky as we were walking back to the Sun Spree where we had parked.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It took place in August 2006. I figured this would be my last or at least my best sighting. I was arriving home from a late class; it was probably around 9:30 to 9:45pm. Everything had gone normally on my 40 mile drive from the community college back to my small town. I had the windows down because it was a warm summer night. To the west of us are several lagoons and a creek, to the east our fields are low and damp most of the summer, thus frogs are loud, very loud all the way up until the first frost. As soon as I turned on to the three-quarter miles of dirt road to my house I was welcomed by the familiar sound of the frogs.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I listened to them, turning off my music before I rolled up my windows and got out.  As soon as I was stepping out of my car onto the driveway, all of the frogs, on either side of our house went entirely silent. It was terribly frightening, as I had lived here all my life and had occasionally heard the frogs in our field stop croaking with the obvious intrusion of a predator. The same went for the occasional silence from the creek behind by neighbors to the west of us. But, I had NEVER heard the frogs from the lagoon stop croaking, not to mention all three locations at once, or even two of them at once.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I don’t really know what made me do it, but trying to locate to source of the suddenly palpable tension from all the life in the woods, (did I mention EVERYTHING stopped making noise, no crickets, no owls, no loons, nothing), I looked up.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Out of my four, maybe five, sightings, I have never been so scared. It was so low. Likely only 200 feet or so from the ground, as it was only 100 feet or so above our 90 foot trees. It scared me so badly I froze, as it was over me when I looked up, but not hovering, rather moving very slowly from the west towards the east. It was so close I could very clearly see its shape. I don’t really know what to call the shape without drawing it. It was very rounded at the font and came to three points at the back. I was directly beneath it so could not see its cabin, but there was a single two-part bright white light in its center and absolutely no landing gear, not even a seam.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I don’t know how to explain what I called the “two-part” light. They were square lights, and right next to each other, vertically on the craft, but the one nearer the front of the craft was brighter.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was not pointing its light at me or at anything really. It was just moving, very, very slowly towards the east. It’s speed was so incredibly slow and it was so low that I actually began panicking after I realized not only had it caused all of the animals to silence, IT made NO NOISE, absolutely nothing, not a hum, not a buzz, not even rustling the leaves in the trees.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As soon as my fear of being abducted passed and it was nearing the edge of the forest I ran straight for the house without looking back. I told my parents directly and was shaking with panic. I still want to say “It was INSANE!” I have no idea what it was. Last year or two years ago, when the military finally admitted to having a Black Manta, I thought that was what it would be. But I’ve seen a Manta, and read of it. It says it’s 60 feet wide and 30 feet long. What I saw was not a triangle, but a half a circle (sort of), with three points on the back. It was likely only 20 feet wide, maybe 20 to 25 feet long.  It was most notably, silent, seamless, and slow moving, and strange that the light didn’t seem overly bright since it was so close.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

My Husband and I were traveling westerly on I-44.  Near Gray Summit, Missouri.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was admiring the sunset when I spotted a very bright white light up in the sky. It was NorthWest of my vehicle at the time, and looked to be like the north star except it was moving very slow, and about cloud level in the sky.  I thought it was strange looking, but assumed that it was either an airplane or a helicopter.  I tried pointing it out to my husband, but he dosen&#39;t believe in UFO&#39;s and proceded in giving me the middle finger.  Anyway.  About the time our vehicle reached the object it had decscend from high up in the sky to more above tree top level.  I watched it intentley and as it passed overhead to the upper right of my truck I was able to look at it. Instead of seeing a helicopter or airplane, it was black triangle with lights on all three sides..white, red, blue were the colors.  The weirdest part was after the UFO passed I turned and looked out the window as much as I could and I saw another smaller white ball of light near the UFO.  I don&#39;t know if it fired or if it was another craft because a split second after I spotted the bright light it vanished completey.  It was a very cool site to behold.

The object appeared to remain in approximately the same area in the sky while slowly rotating on multiple axes. The object was not any recognized propeller aircraft, jet, helicopter, parachute or balloon. The object was too large to be a bird. There were no apparent lights. The object was light in color and readily reflected light from the low-angle sun. There was no trail, aura or haze. There was a single object and it did not make any sound from my vantage point. The were no EMF effect that I detected. While I was driving, I was able to take four digital photos of the object. After exiting Rte. 101 onto eastbound Tully Rd., I was unable to see the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The sky was all blue and the sun was high above me.  Looking over towards the I-182 bridge I noticed a bright light in the sky.  Like a star and silver but within our atmosphere.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I stopped in my tracks and waited for it to move thinking it might of been a plane reflecting light.  The object did not move for nearly 20 seconds as I watched. I walked over to my friend and tapped him on the arm and said &#34;hey do you see that&#34;.  As I pointed at the object the unbelievable happened.  RIght when my fingertip aligned with my eye and the object it sped away at a rate of speed I couldn&#39;t not guess.<n> <n><n> <n><n> But, If I know a plane fly&#39;s at about 300-400 mph, the object I saw was going at about 5000 mph.  It sped away south.  Neither of my friends saw it.  I am the only witness.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The owner of a restaurant near the park also has a sighting reported on here at a later date about 500 yards from where I saw mine.<n>

I noticed his barking was not usual for this hour and I feared there was an intruder of my household. I went to investigate the commotion to make sure there was no intruder. After noting that the house was safe, I decided to take my dog out on a walk to help calm him down.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was just only after walking 500 yards from my house until my dog started to growl toward the sky in a northeastern direction.  It was then that I noticed three white lights flashing brightly in the sky. After my eyes adjusted to the light I realized that I had not seen anything like this before. My dog continued to bark until the three saucers began to display amazing bright light emissions in multiple colors (yellow, blue, white).<n> <n><n> <n><n> The objects continued to hover 300 feet in the air for approx. 4 minutes.  A bright white flash occured next and the objects zoomed back into the night sky, leaving a bright white trail behind them for only 3 seconds. I stood in awe as the objects disappeared back into the midnight sky and my dog quickly became calm again. My location is 8 miles southwest of the junction of highway 80 and interstate 40. Please let me know if anyone else saw this phenomenon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous;  provides no contact information.  PD))<n>

One day, while speaking with my father about the event, he had said he saw the same phenomena.  We talked about it, and past &#34;green flash&#34; events, and traced it back to an air-fuel making plant located in Rosemount, MN, which emits such flashes at times.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Rosemount is about 5 miles North East of my location, and where me and a friend witnessed the same event as well.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Once also, there was a powerfull explosion that came from the plant around five years ago, which illuminated the entire night sky to the point that it was seen from Eagan, MN, which is an estimated seven miles from the plant.  Now I cannot fully include that this is the cause of the flash, but that is what I am now assuming the cause is.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thank you  (COURTESY OF MILE DETERMINATION: GOOGLE MAPS)<n>

All of a sudden it exploded, like the challenger shuttle did some years ago. It left a large trail of smoke high in the sky for hours afterwards. Afterwards we saw jets flying in this same direction. If it was a comet, it sure was close to earth&#39;s atmosphere and exploded coming through the atmosphere.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was the biggest comet-like thing we have ever seen. It was breath-taking. We think it possibly was a jet airliner that was on fire and then exploded all of a sudden. We heard no sound with this. Are there any other reports of this sighting?<n>

Very close to the water south east coast.  For years I have seen what I would always rationalize as stars. The image of flashing bodies of light all of which emit whit, red, green/blue flashes in each body.  I am familiar with Jupiter and some of the other mention of celestial bodies that do this, however cannot find any documentation on the reports that I reviewed concerning the area of the south east coast of Florida.  They can be seen in a clear sky and watching them at length of one to three hours they sometimes deminish and sometimes do not.  The have no speeding movement however do have a formation.  such as that one body forming an iscosoles (sp) triangle, semi circle bowl shape or two triangles, and also by &#34;connecting&#34; dots   I have seen them form a wave like the &#39;approximately&#39; sign on a typewriter key.  On several occasions laying on my back on the beach there are clusters of them up to the number of single lights, 12 forming all the designs I have mentioned.  They are completely well defined as still compared to moving air craft, as I mentioned before they move quite slowly when they deminish as they are moving what appears to be away from me, or are easily shrouded by cloud cover but remain after the cloud is gone.   All of them do sparkle as you have described as &#39;light hitting a diamond&#39;.  the colors are all the same with my eye anyway, red, green, green/blue white.  they do flash however side to side.  They do not have a starburst effect. They are easily seen with binoculars and the flash is side to side on all of them.  (At one time there were five people  with me a few years back as I brought it up to discussion and we planed the night watch and we were not disappointed. Three of the five have knowlege of constellations and none could not explain what we were seeing.  This early morning my interest was sparked again walking my dog, there were five in a bowl shape formation each one from finger to finger viewing about 5inches apart, all flashing as I have described.  I know it is florida and was wondering are these weather satellites, communication sattelites?  Or a larger perspective view of constellation formations that due to the etherial conditions of air, heat, gasses that they flash like this<n>

As i looked at these &#34;stars&#34; they began to move irraticaly, the main formation was one sphere in the center surrounded by 5 other Spheres evenly but they were all pretty much moving in sync. Judging by the speed of the objects and the distance they traveld (which wasnt a long distance) i would say these objects were atleast 3 miles above the atmosphere. I went to check on these &#34;stars&#34; the next night and they wernt there.( i looked at the same time)<n>

I&#39;m not a good judge of distance, but my guess is that the cloud ceiling began at about 500 to 700 feet.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The airborne vehicle was inside the clouds, seemingly trying to hide in them.  As the atmosphere around it swirled about, different views of the ship came into sight.  Eventually, the complete outline was revealed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The nose of the ship was gently rounded, the body, triangular with rounded corners.  The circular center had three &#34;running lights,&#34; two white and one red.  The rear section was again in a triangular shape. The ship was silent, still, completely white except for the running lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was no engine sound.  As other portions of the huge cloud formation swirled,  I noticed part of another craft, exactly like the one I was watching just to the right, and then another to it’s left.  As my gaze moved over the low cloud cover, I could see portions of other crafts in front of it and behind it.  The object I first noticed was part of a fleet of ships and because of the swirling masses, most of what was up there was obscured.  As far as I could see, and that distance was extremely limited, the area of sky over my head was filled with them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Did anyone see what I saw?  Can anyone help me verify?<n>

It was an exceptionaly clear sky with many more stars visible then on an average or mildly overcast night. While I was gazing at an area south of the big dipper, one of the stars began to move. The &#34;Star&#34; moved at what seemed to be a moderate to slow speed but the distance it seemed to cover was enormous. Assuming it was as high as I percieved it to be. If I were to measure the distance between stars with a yard stick, I would say that this &#34;star&#34; travelled at least a quarter yard. Perhaps the length of the big dippers handle..Does that make sense? While it was moving I thought I could see it &#34;tumbling&#34;..Like it was turning over and over as it went. Anyway, When it stopped and assumed a staionery position it took on the appearance of any of the other stars in the sky. (I should mention that my wife and I saw this same thing happen a week or so ago. I reported that sighting too, but I don&#39;t think this is the site I was on)..Anyway, I went into the house to tell my wife and when we came back outside I couldn&#39;t really be sure which on of the stars it was that I saw move. After 5 minutes or so my neck started to hurt from look up and I went to bed. I swear to God that I saw this thing and it was not an airplane, meteor or shooting star..<n> <n><n> <n><n>

At 9:55 PM on 08/23/06 I stepped out on the porch and I saw a very bright light so I got out my spotting scope and this light seems to be turning in a circle from left to right. Then it would drop down and disappear behind a mountain, then back up again this time with another one. The one on the left would get as bright as the moon or brighter and the other would come close to it as if to become one. Then 2 again, the one on the left would stay put and the other would move up and down, closer then farther apart. Then both of them went way up in the sky and seem to move away at the same time faster than any Helicopter. I live 35 miles North of Cody, WY. and these lights looked be South West of Cody. Then they came back, a few times you could see a large flash when it went down below the mountain. I got out my 600,000 candle power spot light and would flash my light at it and the one on the left seem to shine its light back at me a hold it there as long as I did. This went on for 35 minutes. I have no idea what these things were but I&#39;m 54 years old and have been around planes and coppers and I know it was neither.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At one time when I saw lights I called the Cody airport and ask if a plane just took off and they told me no, the tower is close after dark and it&#39;s land at your own risk. I have talked with others that have seen the same lights here for years no one knows what they are. When ever I see these lights they seem to hover in one place for about 15 minutes or so then move very slowly to the left or right then disappear in a blink of an eye.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I wish there was some way or someone to call to report this as it happens so we could find out what they are. I know its not a plane or copper.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I brought is to the attention of the one the correctional officers and they agreed with the same sighting with no action taken.  These sighting happened only during the evening hours until morning.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I saw during the evening hours several crafts that are cone/sphere shaped, each with it’s own color being, orange, red and white.  They land and take off in the middle yard surround by the jail located. I saw small alien like creatures enter in the facility via ports in the walls  (meaning corners of the walls) of certain jail cell where inmates were kept.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I also, experience entry into my body via moment like a pushing feeling.  I felt something enter my body and my urine turned a strange green color and my legs were cramped. I still feel the cramping today.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In March 2007, I saw a beam of light leave landing site going toward space.<n> <n><n> <n><n> During my stay, I heard one of the inmates claim that they went to a planet number #32.  The guards at the facility seem to change in tech and uniforms as to the actual launching of the facility itself.  The entire building would shake as if it were landing and hitting the ground.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I saw that the elevator would go down stairs underground and I still was able to see the lights of the cone/sphere crafts outside my window which would lead me to believe they we went up rather than down stairs.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I showed the guard the lights outside my window and they seem to be aware of  their landing.

8/23/06 15:00|Hollywood|CA|Oval|1 minute +|Black, flashing oval flying and then vanishing over Los Angeles.|10/30/06|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/052/S52237.html|83|ndxe200608| Black, flashing oval flying and then vanishing over Los Angeles.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was outside taking a break from my work place and standing by the parking lot facing south / south-west. From this vantage, I regularly see distant aircraft on their approach or take off from LAX. This time I saw an elliptical object about 40 to 45 degrees above horizon level. What got my attention was that this object was black, or at least some really dark color that looked black.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The day was pretty clear, as in very little haze or smog as well as very little wind. The black object was moving in a steady line from left to right. It was difficult to tell the speed, since it was difficult to tell the distance. However, I do believe it was at least a mile away if not farther. There is another building several yards across the parking lot, so I could not get any distant reference. It did seem like it’s size would be of a large helicopter (maybe a little smaller than a Chinook, but bigger than a corporate Bell) and it’s speed would’ve been comparable at that distance. At first glance this is what I thought it might be since I couldn’t think of any other type of aircraft which would be so black and not looking like a plane.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What changed my mind was it’s sudden flash of white light.  At first I thought it was a reflection of it’s surface from the sun – something I see often from other planes out of LAX. The light was very brilliant white like a large star in the bright, clear blue sky. After about 6-8 seconds, it flashed again. This I thought was very odd, since the reflection off the sun should only happen once unless the object reversed which of course which it did not. After another 6-8 seconds it flashed again. The “shape” of the flash outside of the flare and halo, seemed to be square-ish, as in having right angles. Like that of a light reflecting off a flat mirror or glass. The light was also large and seemed to cover at least half of the object -- the right half from my POV. The reason I’m able to tell you the details of the light is only because it continued to flash in what seemed regular intervals. This was the second most outstanding thing, because at that point, I walked to the middle of the parking lot trying to figure out how the flashes were possible. The light was brilliant and large – nothing like I’ve seen from any aircraft. If it was the sun’s reflection, then the only thing I could think of that would cause regular-interval flashes would be if the black object was rotating in some fashion catching the sun’s rays in each rotation.<n> <n><n> <n><n> If it had continued on it’s way and I lost sight of it, I probably would not have sent this report in, since I have never seen what I would consider a UFO before even though I had been interested in the phenomena.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The reason I am reporting this is because of the most outstanding point of the event: with the last flash, maybe the 6th or 8th, the black object disappeared. Simply vanished. I actually laughed at this because it went against normal reality. When I was watching the object, I was trying to make sense of it: a mylar balloon, or something highly reflective. I&#39;ve never seen or heard of a highly reflective balloon that was that large and black and traveling in a nearly horizontal fashion at that relatively low altitude. But not even a balloon simply vanishes from one second to the next. I scanned the nearby sky around it and stood there for another five minutes, but never saw it again. I could not make out any trail or debris, or anyting. The black flashing oval was unique enough, but to have it disappear completely is truly something I can’t explain.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was only one person I saw walking down the parking lot at that time and he obviously was unaware of anything. By the way, my background is in photography as well as film (cinema.) I also took a flying course in Colorado when I was younger. I believe I am highly aware of what many types of aircraft, from large and small planes to helicopters and blimps look like. Especially living in Los Angeles, we have all of that traffic in the sky. I am also quite familiar to atmospheric distortion and light conditions, so I don’t think I was seeing something that could easily be explained away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thank you for this opportunity for me to report.<n>

I have seen this craft 2 weeks earlier, and took a few photos and video of it.  I tried to take the best photos possible, but trying to keep the camera still without having a tripod is difficult.  In the picture you can make out what appears to be a triangular shaped craft.  At the nose of the craft, you can see a light, and at the tip of the wings there are also lights. The shape is very much there.  The light tracers are very hard to stop because i have no tripod. The camera i&#39;m using is only a dig camera, and not an expensive one.  I also took videos.  I will send you these photos also.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Suddennly, the same shape came back! It was as if it was returning back but not on the same path but a slightly differenet one from the north to south-west. Then suddenly it came back again! The same bright red light from the south-west to the north then it vanished behind the buildings. The light was substantially fast as if you put your hand in the sky and then quickly move it across. Moreover, the light wasn&#39;t sharp. It was blurred, very blurred as if it was shining from behind a fog. I can also say that i even saw something like it when I looked up after all of this was over but it was smaller and moved in a zigzaged formation an then it suddenly dissapeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The whole thing dragged out for what seemed like 10 minutes (when my gutt says it should have taken a minute to two minutes).  They were both triangular, black on the bottom, red light in the center, a white/yellow light on each triangular tip.  Both were 25-30 feet in length.

Weather was good scattered cloud with sunshine about an hour and half before sun set.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Object was round in shape and metalic about size of a small truck, definitley not an aircraft or helicopter or weather balloon.

There were about 15-20 objects flying in formation, like birds fly. However I&#39;m very certain they weren&#39;t birds. They looked like folded paper that was illuminated from the inside. They were glowing kind of dull, not very bright a white/light blue color. There was the main group that maintained in the formation, then two of them trailing behind as if they were trying to catch up to the group. I refer to them as &#34;bird-like&#34; because I&#39;ve never seen anything else fly in that sort of formation. But the objects themselves didn&#39;t have wings and weren&#39;t saucer shapped either. The best way to describe them is to imagine an oragami bird illuminated from the inside. I know it sounds weird, but it&#39;s hard to relate to something I&#39;ve never seen before. It&#39;s difficult to say the size. They seemed small, ( in respect to things I usually see in the sky like planes) but I&#39;m not really sure. They were flying below the clouds, and above the tree lines. But it was still hard to judge their distance away. The whole thing lasted about 7-10 seconds. It made no sounds like a plane or birds, just complete silence. Then then formation continued to fly into the distance until it was no longer visible. Before my friend and I walked outside and saw this formation, the same pattern appeared on his computer screen. The pattern floated across the screen, from left to right until it was off the screen. We thought that somthing was messed up with the power, so thats why we went outside. Only to find the exact same thing flying in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.  PD))<n>

It had 4 whitish/yellow lights on the bottom, which flashed in sequence, front then back. I couldn&#39;t judge the height, but it was large enough to see very clearly, and it passed through some clouds and could still be made out. It made no sound what so ever. There was an  aircraft off in the distance that could be seen and heard. This object was directly overhead. The time of the flight occurance was about 30 sec. The object came through the clouds flying west to east, broke through the clouds, and then disapeared. Once again it made no sound and had no flashing marker lights like a normal aircraft would have. What lights that were on it were much larger and did not flash on a timed interval.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I got out of bed and looked out the window but saw nothing.  Then about a half hour later I saw a bright light, that I thought looked something like a shooting star.  What made it different than a star is it made an abrupt angle downward and dissapeared behind some trees.  I listened to hear if something crashed, like a meteor or something, but I heard nothing.  It was a very bright, white light, something like a firework, with a short tail.  Again, there was no sound.  I called the local radio station to see if anyone had phoned in but no one had.  I then called the police station to see if anyone called there with a weird sighting, but no one had called there either.  I do realize that me lying in bed is the perfect place for me to fall asleep or doze off and imagine something, but right after I saw the trees in the back go dark I woke up my Dad and told him.  Then I went back to bed.  That&#39;s when I saw the bright light fall behind the trees.  I didn&#39;t see any shape or form, just a light with a short tail.  I might also mention that my radio was on the whole time and at no time was there any kind of signal disturbance.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It also had a green flashing light on the right side and a red flashing light on the left side - making it appear like a commercial aircraft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> However, that was not possible as the vehicle was traveling WAY TOO SLOW and Low. It made NO NOISE, possibly a very faint hum for 1-2 seconds.  No engine, jet, or turbo-prop noise whatsoever.  We typically see the &#34;Dash 8&#34; fly over from time to time and we can hear it coming.  NOT so with this.  The positions of the lights made the vehicle appear to be triangular in shape.  I would estimate its speed well under 100, more like 50 mph.  That is the first indication I had of something really different was that I was catching up to it as it approached me and I was doing 55.  Thought maybe it was a chopper, but then the lights were spread apart a good distance like an airplane wing so that was not possible.  Then no noise.  My 10 year old son was with me, who also enjoys watching the sky for airplanes and he remarked, without my saying a word, that it appeared to be triangular in shape.  I was in complete denial at this point!  Upon arriving home I searched for &#34;slow, low, silent moving aircraft&#34; and came upon the tons of articles on the flying triangles.  This surely had all the makings of one.  Oh yes, one additional item I noticed, the flight path followed US RT. 6 - no question on that one.  It came from west to east and I could see from the top of the hill that it was following Rt. 6 and after proceeding to our home, could see it in the distance - flying the same path that US 6 takes.  Amazing!  I would say it was about 1200 feet above us, which would put it at approximately 2500 ft. above sea level.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The first was a fast moving ball of white light above us. The next occured just thirty seconds later just to the left of my grandmothers farmhouse. This time it was much larger becuase it was only about fifty yards away. It was a ball of light with a blue glow emminating from it. It moved in a zig zag pattern, then disappeared all in a matter of about two seconds. We felt an overwhelming sense of joy, but the sight of the seconf one almost made my heart jump out of my chest.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I saw the craft and since it just appereared i took interest that it might be the same craft as my last sighting which had also just appeared out of thin air. I told my girlfriend to hold on and i stared at the craft when it then changed colors, moved to the right popped away then reappeared flew to the middle and dissappeared. I panicked and told my GF what i had just seen. I am always watching the skys since that seconed sighting.

There were some other people around which i immediately made it known that i saw something. However they were all facing my side. I know it wasnt my imagination because as soon as it left, it left this white strip of smoke or cloud for 1 or 2 seconds before even that was gone. My eyes adjusted to the smoke and that was what indicated that i dind&#39;t imagine this.<n> <n><n> <n><n> One thing which i found was very weird was that it dind&#39;t come from somewhere, it just appread and went somewhere in like 1/10 of a second.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I thought maybe it was lightening, or maybe it was some kind of rocket but i never heard anything, and it dind&#39;t rain either. It could have been a shooting star, but the object itself was way to big.

As I drove to New Victoria the light came much closer, it was HUGE. Then out of nowhere 2 more of the same bright lights appeared &amp; by this time 4 cars stopped to watch. It hovered, then moved side to side not making a sound. As it got closer and closer i guess we all panicked. Hit the gas and the lights started to follow, then a few minutes later the lights shot past the car. 3 HUGE lights, no sound whatsoever. I turned down my street and when i was halfway down, i stopped and watched it hover over the woods nearby. After another few minutes of this it was getting too close. Terrified, i hit the gas and booted it home. A friend happened to be driving by and then i saw her car stop dead on the road. Heh, they saw it too. I was home at this point, expecting my friends to show up shortly after but they kept driving. Her boyfriend says the lights hovered, moved a bit, then dissapeared a few minutes later.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

On my way home i saw something running in zig-zags from one side of the road to the other at unhuman speeds. After that it was gone, the next year in school in my photo class me and my friend got to talking about aliens and such and he told me a pretty terrifying story. Well he used to live in Huntington Park and there are fields throughout the park where there are playgrounds and such. Him and one of his friends saw lights flashing in the sky and heard a siren sounds(similar to police). They were shooting fireworks towards the lights in the sky, all of a sudden they look up and saw this thing standing about 60 yards or so from where they were. He said it had long straggly hair, long fingers, and long arms. All of a sudden it started running towards them with it&#39;s arms going in a circular motion and ran the 60 yards in about 3 secs. As soon as they saw it start running they ran into my friends house locked the front door(doorknob and padlock)and their garage where the main door was connected to. They then ran into his bedroom but forgot to shut the door, they were scarred to death, they then argued to who was going to shut the bedroom door he lost and got up to shut it. He then heard all the locks coming undone extremely fast, then the door opened heard it walk into the house. Then heard something glass breaking, and heard the door slam. He shut the door and they stayed awake all night. In the morning his mom asked him why was there a broken bowl in the kitchen, he told her it wasn&#39;t them but didn&#39;t bother telling her the story because she wouldn&#39;t have believed them. After he told me this story i was like no way and told him my experience and we came to the conclusion it was the same type of being running at the extreme speeds that no human would be capable of. if you&#39;ve had ne thing similar contact me Rbreeze001 @ student . monroecc . edu without the spaces between @ and .<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was a cloudy day and the clouds were very dark. I couldnt belive my eyes. I saw about 15 bright purple lights moving very fast from the east to west. I guess maybe 600 mph. They were very high, just below the clouds and were in &#34;c&#34; formation for about 5 seconds. Then they made u turn and flew right over me. I expected hear a noise like a sonic boom or some thing but there was no sound. And when they turned around, they seemed to change formation at the same time and they seemed to merge together into one large bright light. This light seemed to change colors very rapidly. But as soon as they merged, they broke off into about 20 lights. They all turned to back to the original color purple when they lined up side by side. All that happened in about 5 seconds before they were suddenly engulfed by a bright blue light that came out of no where and the light slowly faded. It was completly gone after about a minute and the lights had gone with it. But the area in the clouds where they had been looked like it was glowing a purple-green color and looked like it was radiating some kind of plasma. But it only lasted a few seconds. I looked around to see if anyone else had seen it but I was the only one who had seen it. I drew a sequnce of pictures that depicted what I saw. I was to nervous to tell anyone about till now. I hope that explanes every thing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))<n>

Suddenly about 70 degrees up a red got shot out of the blue.  It kind of moved in an erratic motion.  Then it started to fade away as it went back up.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Suddenly another object appeared, and another.  Finally there were about 20 of them.  I tried to count them but it was difficult because of their pattern.  They make right hand turns or even reverse themselves without slowing down.  Sometimes they would suddenly be ahead of where they were going.  Wasn&#39;t sure they just appeared there or moved so fast I couldn&#39;t see it - kind of like the snap of a rubber band.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They kept coming closer and after a few minutes started to move away.  One kind of hung back, and as the others faded away, it shot to the north west at an incredible speed.  This may sound strange, but it left a hole in the atmosphere.  You could make it out for a few minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Best I can say for color, it&#39;s kind of like looking at a 100 watt light bulb on a bright sunny day.<n>

The same day but much earlier 8-9PM, Myself and 3 other friends were walking along the New Waterford cliffslide next to the ocean and to our discovery we spotted a weird bright star in the sky casting a glow over the ocean.  We thought this was pretty weird considerin the glow. As we watched it, It became bigger and brighter.  At first we all thought it was a meteor and beganning running, But we eventually stopped and watched the light come closer,  As it neared closer, We seen it was a craft of some sort but we all found it very odd that it was not giving off any sounds, Finally it flew overhead in a rather sluggish motion and we all got a pretty good look at what we were seeing. Around it was a faint triangle silohuette, At each corner a orangish light, In the middle a bigger white-blue spotlight and then much smaller pastel-like lights around its rim. After it hovered over us, It headed off towards New Waterford&#39;s town and then suddenly qucikened it&#39;s pace and disapeared over some houses.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is not a hoax nor joke of any kind, There was besides myself, 3 other witnesses present at the time of the sighting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Sinse the event, I tryed to make my sighting go public or get an ufologist&#39;s input on what I&#39;ve seen, But unfortinately could not contact any reliable sources.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am 100% convinced that this could be the same sighting reported in here from New Vic  Thank you<n>

I am a 53 year-old male RN and had just finished working.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I saw a bright light on over the highway in the distance and thought that an airliner was approaching the Minneapolis airport prematurely.  As I drove closer, I then thought that the light was a medical helicopter and I was about to come upon an accident.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I reached Hampton, a very small town than highway 52 passes through, I was astonished to see a triangular shaped craft hovering motionlessly a few hundred feet from the highway, only at about 500 feet of altitude.  The light that I had seen was a unidirectional spotlight mounted on top of the craft, on some kind of pole or extension device.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A county sheriff&#39;s patrol car was parked with its lights off observing the craft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Although I had a camera in the car, I nearly had a panic attack from seeing something that defied my imagination.  I drove slowly by the scene and the craft continued to hover as I saw it in my rear view mirror as I drove away.  I saw no visible means of propulsion on either the underside or sides of the craft.  No vents, no heat plume, and absolutely no noise.<n>

Was watched closely by 2 witnesses who were puzzled as to what it was. Definitely was NOT a plane or even a satellite. Looked similar to a star, but was brighter and larger. Moved awkwardly through the sky, in a half circle pattern. Sped up near the end of it&#39;s flight. When it reached the other end of the sky, it disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I said &#34;it&#39;s a bright star&#34; My Neighbor said watch for a few seconds and that&#39;s when it started moving around the sky in a side/up movement, paused then moved straight down and then strait up. When the craft stopped moving we noticed small bright drops falling from the craft every two seconds if I remember it was about four of them.  At this time we woke up two other households. They witnessed the same movement we saw earlier with the up and down side to side. Before the craft vanished it turned a bright orange color and then vanished.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I saw the same thing a few months later in Sunriver Oregon on New Years Eve working the late shift.  about five minutes after 12:00am in the NW part of the sky, the same location the first sighting was seen I noticed a star that should not have been where this was.  I radio&#39;d other people working &#34;Want to see a UFO&#34;!  Most on the evening shift came running out and saw what seemed to be a UFO. A small group of the bar croud whitnessed the same thing.  A bright object moving sporadically then dropping small bright lights out every two seconds, turned orange then vanished.  This lasted about 10m minutes after we first sighted the craft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The final UFO sighting was in the summer of &#39;07.  I had to respond to an alarm at one of the golf courses at approx. 1:00 AM.  I showed up the same time as the local police, we checked over the club house to find a false alarm.  As we were wrapping thing up I saw a very fast moving bright light moving from West to East and asked the officers &#34;What do you think that is&#34;?  She said a satalite, Jet, and by this time it had moved from the Cascades to Easten Oregon and the final response! &#34;Don&#39;t know&#34;.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;d like to know if anyone else has seen these objects during these time frames.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Warmest Regards Central Oregon Sightings<n>

I was outside at my fire on the shoreline after the whole family went to bed after midnight. There were 2 parties going on in the bay where my cottage is and a few camp fires spotted on the shore. I was gazing at the lake when I thought I saw someone in the lake standing on a shallow rock ledge about 250 yards from shore. There was no moon out and the sky was partially cloudy. The silouette appeared to be glowing a white-green colur at the surface of the water. I watched it thinking must be a reflection, then after about 5 minutes there appeared to be a single white spot light directly above it about 20 feet off the water, again I thought must be someones cottage light reflecting to the water. After about 5 minues there was some blinking between the 2 lights as if going from the waters surface to the light 20 feet above. I again thought maybe kids with flashlights in the woods along shore on the other side of the bay about 400 yards away. After watching awhile longer I looked to the left end of the bay and saw 2 more objects again one larger light orange colour on the water surface with a spot light again 20 feet overhead, I watched all three objects appear to blink in blue and red colours horizontally outwards and back to the centre. The objects appeared to look like a cigar shape almost translucent like you could see an outline however it was see thru. There was all types of different lights flashing in no apparent sequence just mainly blue and green yellow and red lights. I was starting to get a shiver up my spine because numerous times I heard noises around my brother in laws trailer next to the cottage. He was sleeping in the trailer so I thought he was making the noise that night. I was watching the water and noticed the first object I spotted was gone however the other 2 to my left were still there but no more blinking only 2 orange lights again. Straight thru the bay I could see another similar object which appeared to throw a green glowing haze along the water surface and change positions left and right. The flashing lights seemed to get more active when the object approached the cottage having a party. After about another half hour of watching all the strange lights all of a sudden there crept in what seemed like a large fog type mist over the whole bay and I lost sight of all 4 objects. My brother in law told me next morning that he thought something was scratching the trailer walls and he kept his golf club by his side all night he said did not sound like racoon and he thought he could hear movement around the trailer.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous;  provides no contact information.

I am a truckdriver and I was relaxing with my head out the window of my truck and I saw a white object streaking toward, how can I discribe this, let me see, an object in the sky that looked like hole with a white halo around it. The best that I can make of it was that the lights was on the top of it and the light rays were reflecting off the top of the object back into space creating a halo so to speak. Anyway, I counted a total of 17 of these objects fly into it (the halo) and dissapear. I took it they landed on the top. That is what I observed. I know that their is not a ship of ours up there or an orbiting platform of any kind that we have to my knowlege.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Just as we started to go to bed I was looking at stars to the east and suddenly there was a VERY bright flash of light. This light was not accompanied by any sound and seemed within decent range of where we were camped. The light was very bright and then quickly formed into four (4) distinct circular shaped lights: two on one side and two on the other. The new lights were shaped in a very strange, hard to explain way: they were very well formed light sources and the light from them stayed in a round shape as it came shone out from the craft (in fact we never really saw a &#34;craft&#34; per se).<n> <n><n> <n><n> This object flew at a much quicker pace than any of the airplanes we&#39;d see that night and moved towards the west. About 6 seconds into al this the lights went off and became a &#34;pinpoint&#34; kind of light...looking a bit like a satellite does. It then moved VERY fast westerly and then completely disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> All of this really intrigued me so I stayed up for another two hours and saw a total of six (6) of them all moving in the same direction. Some just quick, small points of light and others looking like fluttering wings made of light...very blinky and fluttery and fast in their light. Two of them changed colors from white to red to blue and back, but most were just white. After a couple of hours of this I went to bed perplexed and very intrigued.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The colours were red, green, and white. It was along side a mountian on Saturday night. Then for the next 3 nights it moved directly infront of our living room window along another mountian. We would be able to see it only around 22:30 and stay around for a few hours, and there would always be at least one promenant one...and lil ones that looked farther away in the distance. I personally counted at least 6 lil ones....Then the last night I observed them was on Tuesday August 22, 2006  and when I was watching the closer one ....it started to move eratically and make shapes...almost looked like a worm ...on how fast it was going...it totally freaked me out.... why are they here and why are they staying in almost the samw spot all the time....<n> <n><n> <n><n>

We seen satellites and falling stars..and witnessed a couple of strange things actually..but i dont know if i should just talk about them all at once..The one that caught my eye when i was looking out to lake michigan was very dim at first..i could see it coming our way from about 5 miles away probably..i noticed it first because there was a very bright planet next to the direction it was coming from. As it got to where me and my brother were it was very bright..brighter than satellites are and it wasnt that high up as a satellite is..id say it was about 1,000 ft. maybe..but didnt look too high...maybe because of the brightness of it..and i also had binoculars with me but i couldnt make out any shape because it was hazy looking in the binoculars..so i ran to the other side of the house and it was still there, it was traveling on an angle..going northeast. As it was getting to where i almost couldnt see it anymore it started to pulsate..on and off to dim to bright again about 4 times it did this..and then it was gone..to where i couldnt see it anymore..and then about 15 minutes later,time was prolly around 11:10PM- i noticed this very fast moving object, it had to of been going 2,000 miles per hour..this thing was cruising..it was bright and pulsating also..This one was above my house but way up..but still very bright to be noticed. I ran to the other side of the house but it was already gone..not from the speed of it but i beleive it just disappeared. The third object about 11:30--12 midnight- i seen coming from the northwest was very bright moving pretty fast but not that fast..then it got to where i could hardly see it..like a speck of salt..but i could still see it because i have very good eyes. This all happened in the same night, and the time between seeing each object was close together.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

8/19/06 21:30|Tacoma|WA|Oval|5 to 7 seconds|3 silent objects flying at extreme speed, first resembled tiny stars but loomed larger as out-of-focus, orange "oval" lights|10/30/06|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/052/S52082.html|145|ndxe200608| 3 silent objects flying at extreme speed, first resembled tiny stars but loomed larger as out-of-focus, orange &#34;oval&#34; lights<n> <n><n> <n><n> Let me preface this by saying that I&#39;ve never ever seen anything in my 30+ years that could not be satisfied with some kind of reasonable explanation.  I&#39;ve never before seen or experienced anything that I felt was convincingly supernatural, extraterrestrial, etc.  I am open-minded but skeptical; I am willing to accept the possibility of just about anything being true, but I need to see some hard, scientific evidence.  I majored in biology in college, I work in a medical laboratory, and I am certainly not a flighty person.  Two days ago I would have laughed at the thought of posting a UFO report on the web, and yet here I am.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This all took place last night, Saturday, 8/19/06, at about 9:30 pm in Tacoma, WA.  It had been sunny and clear all day, and the night sky was clear too.  It was warm in the house, so I went out onto my deck in the backyard for some cool air. I reclined in the lounge chair on my deck, facing southeast.  I looked up at the stars, as I like to do, and noted that I could see more stars than usual.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Suddenly, I noticed out of the corner of my eye some movement in the sky directly above my head.  I focused my eyes on the object(s) and at first interpreted what I saw to be a shooting star (by the way, my vision is 20/20).  But then I noticed that there were 3 of them, traveling together (2 were close together, side by side, and the third was slightly ahead (i.e., south) and east of them).  I thought, &#34;Wow, 3 shooting stars?&#34;  They were at this point so far away that they appeared exactly as tiny stars lightyears away, and they were moving as fast as shooting stars.  Not slowly like satellites - they were moving at great speed.  I watched these &#34;shooting stars&#34; for a second or two, waiting for them to burn out.  But they didn&#39;t.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They did not burn out.  In fact, they grew larger in appearance as they traveled and presumably grew closer to the Earth.  What started out looking like tiny white stars shooting across the heavens quickly increased in size until they were maybe 100 times larger than they first appeared.  As they loomed larger their appearance also was transformed, from tiny white specks to, eventually, much larger &#34;ovals&#34; that were light orange in color.  What&#39;s interesting is that as they enlarged they became more out of focus.  It was difficult to distinguish the exact shape or form of these objects, because they appeared as light only (not terribly bright, and not glowing or radiant light -- it was more self-contained), and were so out of focus.  Not blurry or hazy or furry, but out of focus, as though they were traveling so fast that their light was reaching my eyes at a slower rate than at which they were moving.  That&#39;s the only way I can describe it.  I know that nothing travels faster than light, but I imagine that, if something were able to move faster than light, this might be what it would look like.  My brain struggled to assign a shape to their form:  &#34;oval&#34; is what came to mind but this is not entirely accurate.  They were somewhere in between oval, disc-shaped, and boomerang-shaped.  There was no flashing light, no trail behind them, no beams, and absolutely no sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I watched these 3 objects travel across the sky heading south, weaving back and forth slightly (side to side) as they moved.  Then they seemed to swoop down and then continue on in a southwest direction.  Even though they wove from side to side slightly, they maintained their basic formation (basically lined up along an east-west axis, but with 2 close together and one slightly ahead).  At one point, as they flew off into the southwest direction, the 2 that had been closer together moved apart and then returned back together.  They moved extremely quickly and effortlessly across the sky, with great ease and fluidity; they appeared to be extremely agile, smooth, powerful, and with a definite sense of direction or destination (they were not traveling along a rigid trajectory, or meandering or switching directions or moving randomly).  Their flight path was fluid; they appeared to swoop down across the sky, from outer space towards our atmosphere, and then they continued on heading south west.  I watched them until my view was obscured by the roofline of my house.  I jumped up and ran to the edge of my deck to see if I could catch another glimpse of them, but they were gone.  All of this took place in the span of about 5 to 7 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I watched this all unfold, I felt scared, sick to my stomach, awe-struck.  I was overcome with an awareness that I was witnessing something not of this world.  I&#39;ve been racking my brains for some earthly explanation for these objects, that can travel and change altitudes and weave back and forth at tremendous speed, with such agility, all in complete silence.  I&#39;ve never seen a quality of light like that emitted from those objects as they drew closer.  My heart was pounding.  I called people excitedly on my phone, to tell them what I had seen.  I sat out on my deck for some time afterward, searching the sky.  I was scared but felt almost ecstatic to have witnessed something so incredible.  I imagine that others must have seen it too, and I hope that they&#39;ll report it.  And if there is some reasonable, earthly explanation for what I saw, I&#39;d like to know what it is.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

NO PLANE I know of can make the ZIGZAG like a z like it did without moving forward a little bit,,,,and it did it twice. then was gone behind some clouds....the z it made was approximatly maybe a half mile to a mile...I dont know how high it was.....but ive seen planes at the  altitude I believe it was at....It could have been a satilight being moved..? but why the z actions it made? were there anyother reports of it?<n>

I was admiring the huge trees along our block, and upon looking up noticed something between branches, it just caught my eye as I looked up.  As I walked further to a point between the trees, a clear unobstructed view, I say what I term as a large phone booth object at about 70 degrees from southern horizon.  I stopped rubbed my eyes, shook my head. and it was still there.  It was a silver to whitish color except for the top 1/8 which was a brilliant yellowish light. I stood for a couple minutes trying to get a good look at it. I estimate the altitude to be about 1500-2000 ft.  It had no wings, no rotors, and stood perfectly still, there was no wind it was dead calm.  I tried to listen and could hear nothing.  After about 3 minutes it finally hit me, this was definitely not normal and defied any aerodynamic craft I have ever scene.  I started to get scared, and proceeded towards the store, hoping it had not seen me, keeping my eyes on it, when the next moment it started to accelerate and then took off East at a speed that was unbelievable, before I knew it it was out of sight.  I would estimate its size being aprox 20-30 ft tall by 15 to 20 ft across.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

(Something very odd going on in that department!)<n> <n><n> <n><n> Anyway, almost as soon as I looked up and almost directly overhead, I saw what I at first thought was a very bright planet - until, that is, I realized it was moving quite slowly on a roughly north to south trajectory. And very quickly after that realization the object swiftly flared brighter and brighter until I became rather alarmed - I would estimate its lumens quadrupled - and then suddenly its intensity dropped off as though somebody had thrown a switch, but it was actually still faintly visible via peripheral vision.  In other words to still see it after it flared out, I had to look slightly to the side of its trajectory.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;m thinking it was a satellite of some sort reflecting the predawn sun as it rolled in orbit - it seemed to be at satellite height - but at the same time it seemed to move too slowly to fall into that category.  The brightness of the object when it flared was astonishing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is the second time I&#39;ve seen this object (or something similar) flaring overhead.

8/19/06 00:15|Woburn|MA|Cylinder|5-6 seconds|Bright, hazy clyindrical object appearing and disappearing in Boston area|10/30/06|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/052/S52077.html|155|ndxe200608| Bright, hazy clyindrical object appearing and disappearing in Boston area<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was sitting outside shortly after midnight, August 19 (the night of the 18th), 2006, when a light in the sky caught my attention. The object was large; it was probably almost about a half an inch long from my perspective, which would seemingly be a huge &#34;craft&#34; or object considering it appeared very high up in our atmosphere. The object radiated as a blue-white light, and although it appeared as somewhat of a haze (I couldn&#39;t make out any specific edges or details of the object), it took the shape of a cylinder, with its height being about one-third its length. When I first saw the object it was moving slowly; however, at the altitude it appeared to be flying at its rate would be quite fast. The object then sped up as it made its way across the sky, at a rate that was much faster than any airplane I&#39;ve seen at a comparable altitude. After about five seconds or so, the object made one last acceleration that had to have at least tripled its speed, and disappeared as it moved upward and seemed to leave the atmosphere. The last acceleration of speed before its disappearance is what has stuck with me—it seemed straight out of a science fiction movie. Nothing that I’m aware of could move that fast. I’m a sane person, with no prior UFO sightings or unexplainable phenomena in my past. I spent most of my time in the 24 hours after the incident trying to convince myself of some rational explanation, and I’ve realized that no known human craft or atmospheric event could have accounted for what I saw. I want to know what it was, and if anyone else saw it! Some other details concerning the event: 1) It was a clear night; more stars than are generally visible in my area were visible on this night. I took this into consideration while trying to determine the object’s altitude. The fact that it was an illuminated object with no real shape other than a hazy cylinder caused me to believe that it was very high up in our atmosphere. 2) The object made no sound. 3) Regretfully, I was alone at the time. I was outside for no more than two minutes when I saw the object; my girlfriend and three of my friends were inside the house at the time. My only regret in this experience is that no one was there with me to experience and validate what I saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The light was very, very bright and about 4 times as big as the light on an airliner. (We are in a flight path, for flights coming from the east over the Cascades, so we know what they look like.) It did not make any sound we could hear. At first we thought maybe it was a  meteor falling, but then it stopped falling and changed direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Just before the first of two sky watches was held, a bunch of us headed for the parking lot for our lawn chairs and jackets.  Someone yelled to look up at the eastern sky, and we observed an object that I could not explain -- it was a tiny dot that would flare brilliantly (white) into what I saw as an almost triangular shape.  I swear I also saw what looked like two faint stick-like protuberances on either side.  The object then went back to its regular very faint dot, then flared brightly a couple of more times before becoming so faint that it eventually disappeared.  I frankly was so taken by the beauty of the thing that I didn&#39;t pay much attention to speed (it was moving from north to south).  It would be interesting if some of my fellow witnesses would come forward and give their own version of what they saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I found that this was the best sighting (for me) of my three days there.  I sat for several hours in the sky watches and did see some objects that did not behave like the airplanes, shooting stars, and satellites I did observe in the beautiful crystal-clear night skies outside of Trout Lake.  I suppose you would call these UFOs since I could not identify them!<n>

I grabbed the binocs and watched it and by this time it was moving away from me at a west/n. west direction.  The strange thing though is that this light, flashing white and red was not in a regular fashion like a jet and the light was bouncing in my view....like not steady at all, it would be high then to the side, then lower, very eradic.  I&#39;ve actually seen this several times and I noticed someone else a couple months ago reported a similar sighting wondering if anyone else had seen this.  I have several times and this is NO PLANE or helicopter or star in my opinion, this thing moves~travels in a very eradic way.  I also see dozens of jets and other small aircraft on a daily basis being right near and under the flight patterns, so I know what they look like and how they behave in their flight patterns. I watched this bouncy light as it went off towards the Olympic Mountains and out of my view.  I can&#39;t imagine no-one else seeing this thing, so would be interesting to see if there are any other reports.  There were commercial aircraft in their normal flight patterns above this thing when I was watching it...not even close to the same.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The line of sight was unobstructed by any trees or clouds in the sky. There was a tree to the left of the object that we were able to tract how far the light was descending. There was no sound. The light was 10 times bigger than any other star in the sky. We were standing underneath a street light and quite shocked when we noticed the unusual behavior of the light. We then blocked the street light out of our vision with our hands and noticed the other stars in the sky. It was not a plane or satellite as first two osbervers have seen both on numerous occassions in the night sky.

H elooked and said, &#34;yeah its bright, its probably the top of a tower.&#34; As we kept driving towards the mountains I kept watching it and it was getting closer and brighter. As it got closer I could see two balls of light side by side. Then it began coming closer till it was right above us. I opened the sun roof and we pulled the car over to the side of the freeway so we could stop and watch it. It was directly over head and it was in a triangle shape. There were two white balls of light in front, and behind those two but alittle closer together were two slightly smaller balls of light. It was still quite light outside, and despite the size of these balls of light, i could see no craft that would be connecting the lights. And in the middle of all thses lights was a signel blinking light.We watched in awe as it moved out of sight. I live in LA near two major airports and this is nothign like i have ever seen. The only colors were white, no red blinking lights like what are normally on aircrafts.This aircraft moved very quick, but it seemed to slow down above our car like it knew we were watching.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I looked out my window and off in the distance I see this flashing light. It also dident move at all for the first ten minutes i was looking at it. and then for a good 5 to 10 seconds it was gone and came back. as i am typing this i can still see it. it is moving arround very fast there is no way it is a hellicopter or plane.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
8/17/06 23:08|Cedar Lake|IN|Other|10 seconds|Floating lights in a rooftop formation|10/30/06|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/052/S52027.html|169|ndxe200608| Floating lights in a rooftop formation<n> <n><n> <n><n> While returning home from town after picking up pizza, we forgot to drop off a movie.  I began to turn around in a vacant golf course.  When I turned North into the lot, there was a bright series of lights directly in front of us and just over our heads.  The sky was light blue with thin whisps of clouds.  Our windows were down and I was talking on the phone to a friend.  My daughter and I were amazed at what was in front of us and I expressed this to my caller and daughter by saying , oh my god, what is in front of us.  I said are those planes, they can&#39;t be planes, what is in front of us.  I leaned my head towards the open window for any sound.  My daughter was already amazed by what she saw.  We both were excited and stunned by what we thought was a UFO.  My daughter actually yelled it&#39;s a UFO.  I think it&#39;s going to land.  My other daughter in the back seat said she couldn&#39;t see anything and was frightened telling us she wanted to get out of here quick.  I told my caller that she needed to step outside and look north, there are some kind of lights in the sky, but it was already fading away while I was speaking to her.  What my daughter and I viewed was a multiple light formation containing six individual lights that were very bright in the center and grayish on the outside.  My daughter (age 15) said that she could see a thin gray outline like it was a craft.  I did not view that myself, but I was also looking over at her and glancing back to my other daughter while talking on the phone.  It happened very quickly.  Five of these lights were in the formation of a rooftop with one light at the peak and two lights on each side.  The sixth light was centered a short distance below the peak.  They all stayed in this formation and seemed to float moving only slightly up and down as if they were suspended in air.  We had the impression that whatever we were seeing was attempting to land in the field or empty parking lot.  We thought it was a formation of jets but they were way too close to each other.  With the windows down, there was no sound of planes either.  And there was a plane flying below them iin a slanted east to west direction which my daughter pointed out when I asked if they were planes.  No, she said, that&#39;s a plane below them, this is a UFO!  It was obvious these sets of lights were significantly different than a plane light. Then all of the lights seemed to close at once as if they each had a sliding door that closed from our right to our left.  Each light left a very small sliver of light like a piece of moon.  The formation then seemed to move slightly up and west.  It had no shape of an object, like the side of a plane would have or anything of that nature as it turned.  It was just those slivers of light that moved as one.  They didn&#39;t move out of our sight, they disappeared out of our sight.  It was as if they were the same backgound of the sky but with slivers of light.  I guess you would say whatever it was now seemed to be transparent.  My daughter was asking me if I could see the thin gray outline of it too because she could and she knew it was an UFO!  I had glanced away and found it difficult to see it again, but she watched for a second or two more but she said it was gone...and just disappeared.  VERY VERY WEIRD and VERY VERY COOL.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Now, let me tell you.  There is an air show scheduled this weekend in Chicago. My family did view a jet flying over.  My husband could hear the jet when it went over. I was in the car alone earlier and saw a jet overhead too.  I recognized it as a jet because jets are obvious with there beak style nose and slim body.  I thought that maybe there was an air show somewhere this weekend and that was why a jet was in our area.  And that is also why my first thoughts at seeing this formation was that it has to be jets in formation.  However, when we were viewing this ten seconds of lights there were no sounds of planes/jets, no visuals of a plane/jet either while it was facing us or when it turned/moved or whatever it did to leave.  And I don&#39;t think jets just disappear.  This was truly the coolest thing we have ever seen and I was glad that I saw it with someone else. Excitedly I called a family member and my other daughter called a friend.  I thought about calling someone somewhere and reporting it, but who?  You don&#39;t want people to think you are some kind of kook or something.  I also hoped that maybe someone else had seen it and it would be on the news or in the paper.  I don&#39;t know if this is an official site to report UFO&#39;s or if it does any good to report it at all.  But it was definitely awesome to see something that unknown and interesting!<n>

They appear to be from Beal AFB and/or somewhere south.  They hover like stars in the sky and can bleep in and out as needed.  They emit many colors and seem to be a bit unstable.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I now know that the light is a scanner system for the surface of the earth.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I borrowed a telescop from a friend and took it to another friends home to try.  As I did,,, I noticed that they seem to be aware of me watching them.  As I drove home about 10 miles. I could see and feel one at my back all the times.  I had to go see my mother.  Even though I had to talk to her, I was afraid to tell my mother as she wouldn&#39;t have believed me,,, nor would my wife.  THEY DO NOW!!!!!!!!  When I set up the scope at my Mothers home,,, a large craft dropped out of the sky and hovered just behind the tree line.  That was all the evidence my mother needed.  She was at once astonished and then she scolded me and said &#34;believe me son,,, you don&#39;t want to keep doing this.  As usual I didn&#39;t listen,,, perhaps someday I will.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I went home and got my son,,, we dove 2 miles to a clear spot in the canyon.  It was there that my son and I watched a craft hover over head at 800 to one thousand feet, and just drop to the ground.  No sound????????  no movement not even any heat..  My son and I had a real bad feeling and chose to leave then.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is no joke. I would advise any skeptic not to look if you don&#39;t want to know.  These are war games they are working on or,,,they are really in combat.  See for yourself.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My son is a believer now,,,, and my wife and mother are too. THIS IS REALL,,,, I was in the military many years ago.  I can tell you that I believe they are about to make this public.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have never seen a ship that can defy gravity, has somekind of radar or defense beam, and appears to be able to fly at 50 to 80 thousand miles an hour.  I can blink out to invisible!!!!!!   The place is in the greater Sacramento area in the foothills of the Sierra Nevadas.  It happens every night but Sunday (Even Aliens need to go to church).  If you want to see the show,,,come and get it.  It brought around a skeptic like me.  Please,,, don&#39;t aim a telescope at any of the craft.  When they scan,,, they see the return beam from the reflection. I am certain thats why they took a close look at my son and I.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I must look like a shoulder fired missle.  I would be nervous too.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I think they are X22-A&#39;s and several other manufacturers.  I love the home team.  I just which I knew who the home team in this case.<n> <n><n> <n><n> These are US owned and operated though.  Call it a Former Marine&#39;s gut feeling.<n>

The light did not waver as to intensity the entire time.  What was of concern was the manner of movement, it would move to the left and right, up and down.  At one point we saw the light come to a complete stop, move up and down then it proceeded on its orignal flight path.  This is the first time I have ever seen anything like this.  I am ex Military and Law Enforcement, I am pretty up on anything that flies.  This was moving like NOTHING I or the others present had ever seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
8/17/06 22:05|Midvale|UT|Other|40 minutes|Strange objects in the night sky over Midvale (Salt Lake City), Utah|10/30/06|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/052/S52024.html|172|ndxe200608| Strange objects in the night sky over Midvale (Salt Lake City), Utah<n> <n><n> <n><n> August 17th, 2006 -- a few minutes after 22:00 MST  This was at night, no moon, slightly hazy but the stars could be seen pretty well.  I was sitting outside of my house in Midvale (Salt Lake City) Utah having a cigarette.  After casually gazing at the southern sky for a few minutes I started noticing objects appearing from the east.  My first impression was that it was a flock of white birds, illuminated by the city lights, flying to the west.  But then they formed into a perfect triangle, changed course slightly, and traveled west then disappeared into the sky.  Frankly, I thought I was just seeing things or they were in fact a flock of birds.  Another wave of these white objects then appeared, formed into 3 triangles, then headed to the west.  At this point, I was convinced I was seeing UFOs.  I am 30 years old and have never dreamed that I would witness something so strange in the night sky.  Then I started seeing other types of objects.  They were very big objects that looked liked grey clouds, but they all had sharp edges and were with the same exact shape, these flew side by side and headed of towards the western sky.  They started coming wave after wave, mostly the white objects that were sometimes accompanied by the much larger grey objects.  At this point I was getting quite scared and simply could not believe what I was seeing.  Then I saw a group of red orbs that formed into a cluster ball, this was surrounded by some kind of light that resembled a corona or aura.  This headed in a slightly different direction but still slowly to the west.  When it traveled, it passed behind my neighbors house, then reappeared on the other side then faded after it traveled for a bit.  I was already stunned by witnessing the previous objects, but this one just blew me away.  After that happened there was nothing in the sky for a few minutes, then the waves of the white and grey objects passed close overhead.  This went stop and go and the entire experience lasted around 40 minutes.  During the time I was on the phone with my girlfriend and brother describing what I was seeing and was astounded to say the least.  I have always been a skeptic.  I don&#39;t believe in ghosts, voodoo, psychics and such things.  I have always had doubts about UFOs, but I always believed they could be possible.  I never thought that in my life I would see something like this and hopefully I will always remember.  This could not have been anything man made.  The way the objects were moving in the sky almost looked like they were alive.  They were completely silent as they grouped up in formation and flew towards the west.  It is hard to say how far the objects were considering that I have no idea what they were.  All of the objects were kind of faint, but you could still make them out because of their movement.  One of the white object clusters blinked several times then disappeared.  I sincerely hope somebody confirms this event, it was awesome and I would like to compare sightings.  I called FOX news to see if anyone else reported, but they said no.  I made this call at 23:15 MST.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Made quicker darting movements then went in a fast line over our building.  Glimpsed from below as it passed over, was diamond shaped (could tell from the 4 lights).  2 red lights looking like Automobile side mirror lights in newer vehicles - red lights had right angle shape, defining the diamond.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About 30 minutes later, another craft spotted, this time going from NNE to SE sky.  Was dim at first and when passed noticed it had lights in triangle pattern, with one red, one green, one BRIGHT pulsating light, pulsing in sequences of 3.  Unsure of whether this was a plane but either craft emitted no sound and this craft did not match similar viewings of planes in the sky at night.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was the size of a oval table with radius around 1 meter.<n>

After the first 5 seconds of focusing in on both lights, the second one disappeared. These looked to be outside of our atmosphere as the light looked to be reflected from the sun. If the second one vanished that fast, it must have dropped into the atmosphere very fast and out of the suns path. The one that stayed in my vision the longest, appeared to make a sudden corrective change but still heading north. The light was bright white. I thought it might be a satellite, however there were two of them and they were close together going in the same direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The objects appeared oval shaped when still and we they continue to move sideways, they appeared as fireballs again. Another fireball appeared and did the same routine as the other set of objects. The objects didn&#39;t make any sound because it was a quiet night. Then they all vanished and didn&#39;t appear again. The color of the objects are bright yellow. The objects seemed to be over Gary, Indiana near Cline Ave. and Chicago Ave. There could possibly be more witnesses on this event due to cars driving near the area.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I had just bought a new telescope on the 14th and was star gazing at about 10 pm.  There were two passerby&#39;s at about 10:20 who saw the high altitude craft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was outside setting up my new telescope since it was a very clear night and my new telescope&#39;s laser sight was sighted in and ready for use. I first sat down for a smoke then I saw the ufo. It appears to be similar to the last high altitude one I saw and it was the same approximate time, except that this one circled counterclockwise at least three times over the course of the viewing. The circlular flight path was probably at least 5 - 10 miles round, probably more like 20-30 miles. I saw the object when it was at the high altitude to the east through a telescope for a second, the shape looked almost like two D&#39;s piggybacking and was slight bit greenish tint to the light. I saw stars go by right next to the light on all sides so the craft appeared to be only as big as the light. I was surprised to see it appeared as though there were no other dimension to the craft other than the light itself.  When I view planes with a telescope or binoculars at night, they have a gray area where the lights arent and you can see stars get blocked by other parts of the craft not lit. This was not that way at all. Airplane lights also light up part of the fuselage which was not evident on this craft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I heard nothing in the way of aircraft noises, no jet engines, propeller noises or helicopter noises.  F-16&#39;s from Selfridge always make a roar when flying around. Two people came walking by, a man and a woman, and they were pointing at what I was looking at. We met up in my side yard and watched together for a couple of minutes. It was dim then got kind of bright white, then dimmed when I turned my back to get my telescope (wanted to see it again while it was brighter) then the passerbys said that the object dimmed to red and then to off and disappeared to the East over Saint Clair Shores. The walkers both said there was no way that was a plane. The male walker said that he thought the craft looked to be almost in orbit, or much higher than commercial craft. The female walker was telling me that she saw the same kind of light show from craft recently and slugged her companion in the shoulder for telling her that her sighting, which he did not see, was a sattelite.  On this night, the man admitted that this couldnt be a sattelite or an aircraft. All three of us were mildly excited about the UFO, and the couple walked on after about 20 seconds of the craft not being visible.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As the walkers left a couple of minutes later I saw the craft come back again from the north heading southbound then turned to the east then north again, this circlular flight path was the smallest of the night and the craft was the lowest it had been to this point. When it got to direct north of my position it disappeared behind trees.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then about 20 seconds after that I saw a white shape, very dimly lit that looked saucer shaped and it looked about the size of a private jet, maybe a little bigger. This was to the Northwest which I had not seen anything in this area before. This time it was much closer but much dimmer and the craft&#39;s surface was all the same dim lit greenish but mostly white color. The object was at only a few thousand feet altitude, looked kind of like the letter D resting on its back and it shot east at incredible speed with non-linear accelleration. The acceleration kind of bounced (hard to describe) then disappeared behind some trees.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The wind was from the West at gusts to 20mph, but this object went fast against the wind and the movement looked unreal. At very first glance it appeared almost to be a white balloon in the dark, but the movement was so unorthodox and against the wind and the speed at the end of the acceleration was too high for anything manmade I am aware of. I am guessing that the craft was the same craft in both instances, one higher than the other, but I do not know for sure. For one thing it appeared to go from a double D to a single D (no pun intended)shape, but in the last closest sighting, the color was similar, just far less intense. This portion of the sighting was quite wierd and so beyond my experience that I still have a hard time admitting what I saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date of the event may be approximate.

I went out side and looked trying to find them and while trying to find them I spotted this object to the east of my location. I watched as it slowly went east-northeast very slowly and then it stopped. It stayed in one location for about 30 seconds and the jets came back around and came into my view under the object. I estamated the alitude of the object at about 15 to 20 thousand ft, as it went east over the mountian range east of my house. It appeared to be a circular object and was very bright and then dem. I thought this was odd and watched two more jets come around into my view. At that point in went inside and go my binoculars and came back outside and looked for about 15 seconds until I spotted it again and put the glasses on it. As I watched it the jets just kept coming around in circles. There were four of them, two each close to each other, maybe 20 seconds apart in my view. As the went by they were always under the object. As the jets came around the object went higher. I watched until I could no longer hear the jets or see the 0bject in my view through the glasses. The jets were military and I could make them out very well when it first started. I have watched many objects at night here in AZ but never reported them. They are always to the east southeast, in the direction of Phoenix and the air force base.This was the first time I have seen an object in the day light that was that clear and close that I could tell that it was not an airliner or military jet. I watch jetliners going over at night and can see them clear enough to almost tell you what the company is.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
8/17/06 04:00|Georgtown|TX|Light|20 min|2 bright lights hovering over Interstate 35.|10/30/06|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/052/S52049.html|182|ndxe200608| 2 bright lights hovering over Interstate 35.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;m a truck driver and noticed in the distance approx 10 miles down Interstate 35N bound, notice one bright white light in the sky. A couple of min. went by and the steady light seperated into two bright steady lights. As I got closer I could notice the lights were hovering over Interstate 35 as if just observing the traffic lights. As I got closer I also notice 3 very small blue steady lights approx. 50 ft away from the 2 main white lights. As I got eventually directly under the lights I rolled down the window and looked out for a better view and one light turned off (not faded slowly). Seconds later the 2nd light turned off.  There was not sound. And I know that other vehicles had seen the lights. Every vehicle had slowed down from 65 mph to about 45mph to catch a glimpse. The lights did appear to be very close to ground.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
8/17/06 00:15|El Paso|IL|Light|15-20 Minutes|Bright Flashing Light In Western Sky w/ Multi-Colored Lights|10/30/06|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/052/S52157.html|183|ndxe200608| Bright Flashing Light In Western Sky w/ Multi-Colored Lights<n> <n><n> <n><n> At approximately midnight on the night of 8/16/06, the morning of 8/17/06, I was preparing to go to bed for the night and was making my rounds making sure that the doors were secured.  While locking our westward facing sliding door I noticed a stationary and flashing light that seemed to be bigger and brighter than the surrounding stars.  The size and brightness appeared to be at least twice the size of stars near the position of the light. It appeared similar to a street light from two miles away.  The somewhat large size and the quickly changing colors are what cought my eye.  The light appeared motionless long enough to be video taped for several minutes.  The sky was partly cloudy with a half moon near the eastern horizon.  With the video camera zoomed in on the light it appeared diffused with a very bright center region with multiple flashes of red, green, purple, and white lights around the edge.  When I first saw the light I assumed that it was Venus but it appeared brighter and bigger with multiple flashing colors.  I will attempt to download the digital video in the near future.  The light was positioned west by north west from my position at approximately 25 degrees from the western horizon.  At approximately 12:20am on 8/17/06 I stopped recording and went in the house to go to bed with the light still in the same position.  I have assumed that the light was Venus but crop circles have been reported 60 miles west by north west of my position and thought that I should at least report my experience.  Total vewing time would be about 20 minutes.  At one point a commercial flight passed within the &#34;vicintiy&#34; of the light without making any noticable flight path changes.  Venus?  Or Intergalatic Crop Dusters????<n>

We noticed what we at first thought was a star, a pulsing blue/white light. As we both looked at it, it appeared that a red light danced first to the left and then the right. The light did not appear to move, and although we live close to an AFB, we wrote it off as not being a plane. It did not move at all. We saw the red light/s blink several times, and then tapped on our neighbor&#39;s window. She came out and confirmed that yes, the light stood still, and yes, the red light went left and then right (she said this without us having mentioned it). The light then seemed as if it were getting lower. It started appearing smaller and &#34;sinking&#34; about 30 minutes after we noticed it, until it dissapeared behind neighboring buildings. The light did not appear in photographs or on video we tried taking.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Through the window to my left I noticed a bright red flashing light, stationary in the western sky.  I expected it to move, but it didn&#39;t.  As I watched it for a minute or so the red light changed from a single red light to a somewhat circular array of less intense lights that did not flash.  I could now see red, white and blue-green colored lights.  I thought my eyes were playing tricks on me so I got up and went outside with binoculars.  As I watched it would alternate between the two light paterns.  After about a minute it started to move toward the east.  It moved slowly at first and rapidly gained speed as it passed overhead and went out of sight to the east.  It was a very quiet night with no wind and we did not hear a sound.  It accelerated to a speed faster than a jet plane.  A moment after we lost sight of it,(my wife was standing beside me watching this also, we saw what looked like a very bright meteor drop almost straight down, about 5 degrees to the left of where we had last seen the odd lights which had passed out of our view behind trees.  The meteor was bright yellow and lasted only a second.  It may have had nothing to do with the lights we were watching.  Most of the sky was very clear and full of stars.  There were some clouds low in the sky to the west.  We could not see the actual shape of the object, only the lights.  We saw the lights against a clear sky, not through clouds.  Whatever it was it appeared to be quite high in the sky.  I would guess between 25000 &amp; 45000 feet.  My wife and I are both retired.  We live on a mountain top at the end of a dead end road, about a mile from any neighbors.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I told my dad and he saw it and said it was a plane. After 15mins he came back out and said it wasnt one but he didnt know what it was. I considered it being a radio tower but there is none out that way. I called my friend and he came over and got it on his phone. I took some pics but I havnt got them developed yet. I do know there was increased air traiffic. I called the Ky State Police and reported it to Ashland. They called me back and gave me a number which didint work.

When all of a sudden I saw a bright white/orangish light that appeared to be coming from a north westerly direction at a high rate of speed.In the blink of an eye it vanished.I initally thought it was ball lightning due to the lightning storm that was taking place farther north of my location.My thought at the time was &#34;cool&#34; I just saw my first ball lightning.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Tonight on 8-16-06 at about 8:49pm I was again standing on my front porch smoking and just happened to look up and saw the same light! It was very bright and white/orangish looking. This time however it was almost straight overhead and again appeared to be traveling very fast and was visible for about 2 seconds when it blinked out. I&#39;ve seen many things in the night sky including airplanes, satellites,ISS, meteorites, fireballs and comets but this light looked different and did not appear to resemble any of those things.<n> <n><n> <n><n> *I am wondering if anyone else in the Spring Hill,Tn area has seen anything like this?<n>

At first we thought it might be a satellite, but then it started changing speed and direction.  It seemed to randomly wobble back and forth, and slow down and speed up.  Whatever it was, it was pretty high up.  No shape could be seen, just the light, which was as bright as some of the brightest stars.  As it approached the western horizon, the light stopped and stayed in one place while it slowly faded away.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

They seem to like to hang out in our woods by here at night and flash lights like lightning across the treetops, once I even seen a hovering ball of light trying to get me to follow it, it was about 5 inches in diameter and came from nowhere and hovered and headed towards the woods, it pulsated 4 or five times in about the same amount of minutes, but usually they just flash lights all night and I can feel their presence in the house late at night, but have yet to see an actual extra-terrestrial in a body form, I have only heard them and felt their presence. It seems very likely that they are truly trying to show me something I have been wanting to know.

It was able to change direction and disappear and appear again quickly. There is no possible way it was another aircraft.  We could see the shape of the other plane. But this had no shape. It just appeared like a spark in the sky around the plane and then it disappeared and we did not see it again.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

We were just talking and I happened to look up at the sky. Dusk was just ending and night beginning. The sky was also almost completely cloudy. While I was looking up I noticed a reddish-orange light to the east. It &#34;zoomed&#34; very quickly from the eastern horizon to the western horizon. The closer to the west it got, the more I could see it&#39;s shape...it was somewhat disk-shaped/oval-shaped and glowing a warm orange color. It also left a small trail which I assume was due to its speed and probably a trick on the eyes. Almost to the edge of the western horizon it disappeard in a sort of orangish flash. It was completely silent.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I talked to my coworker about it, and she suggested it might have been a shooting-star/meteor. My father is a hobby astronomer so I have seen my share of meteors, even in the daytime...the huge fireball kind. But, this was unlike any &#34;meteor&#34; I&#39;ve ever seen. The way it vanished in a flash of light and the definitive shape of it was interesting. Also, it seemed so close aboved our heads...if a meteor were that close it would have been EXTREMELY bright...and this wasn&#39;t. It was semi-bright and seemed to glow. Plus, if it were a meteor, I would assume that it would have had to be very low for a meteor to be UNDER the clouds. Finally, it didn&#39;t come from an angle...it came horizontally all the way from one horizon to the other.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It has always been my dream to become a ufologist...so if this is the real thing...AMAZING. It was unlike anything I have ever seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I happened to look up and saw an unlit/black diamond (from my angle) with a red blinking light on the bottom point.  Not sure if there was one on the top.  It flew or glided about 30 feet above the empty little feild where just the dim lights were on after the game.  It seemed to come from the trees and slightly decend but it kept going until it crossed the field and disapeared over the buidlings.  It was probably about as big a large door way in a school building or a possibly a very large trash can.  I would say it was going at about twenty mph if not slower.  It made no noise, i would have never known it was there if i hadn&#39;t turned my head to look.  The game had ended maybe 45 minutes before and in the summer months since it was dark outside, it had to be around 9 to 10 pm. 9:45 maybe.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date is approximate.

A friend and I like flying model planes. In the summer heat we typically go out late and fly until dusk. Naturally we are looking up at the sky as it darkens.<n> <n><n> <n><n> One day last week we are flying, and my friend Jim asks me &#34;what is that bright planet overhead.&#34; I look up and see a &#34;star&#34; a couple fists width due west of Zenith that has to be as bright as Venus at sunset.  But, I know there is no star or planet that bright in that part of the sky.  So, I tell my friend that I have no idea; maybe an iridium satellite?  After a while, my friend says the &#34;satellite&#34; hasn&#39;t moved, and I take my eyes off my plane as long as I dare to confirm that no movement is detectable. We decide that we just don&#39;t know....maybe it is a slow moving satellite that we have no sky reference to detect motion.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As it darkens, the star/satellite disappears, and we don&#39;t say anymore about it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On Tuesday, August 15, at 7:50pm CDT, my friend calls me on the phone and tells me &#34;that thing&#34; is back in the sky, and &#34;in the same place.&#34;  I go out on the deck, and there it is again...same light, same brightness, same place...best as I can tell. I laid my back down on the house deck and aligned the object with a mark on the handrail to see if I could detect motion....I couldn&#39;t. I&#39;m interested, so, I ran into the house to get the binoculars.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Outside with the binos 15 seconds later, I lay down on the deck to steady myself, focus, and....I can resolve a disk at 10x;...circular and bright, definitely not stellar in any case. Reminds me of Jupiter through a low power view, perhaps 50 arcseconds in diameter to show a disk at such low power.  Now I&#39;m really interested, except that the binoculars fogged up in the humidity in just a half minute, and I can&#39;t see anymore.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So, I trot off to the shed thinking of what instrument I could grab for a quick view and mentally settle on 80mm f/5 &#34;shorty&#34; refractor that is mounted on a Bogen camera tripod and ready to snatch and view. It takes about 10 seconds to get to the shed door, and as I look up to fix the object from that location, it is completely gone.  The object dropped from what was probably about -3 to -4 visible magnitude to absoutely nothing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Phone rings...it&#39;s my flying friend, and I know what he&#39;s going to say....he has a telescope and says that he had the object sighted in the viewfinder, but when he looked into the 40x eyepiece...it was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I don&#39;t know what the object was, but I can say for certain what it wasn&#39;t.  I wasn&#39;t a planet, a satellite, a comet, an asteroid, an aircraft, or a star.  I&#39;m thinking high altitude balloon?<n>

It was above and behind a large thunder storm. Could see the glare of metal from the sun but no signs of wings or a tail, somewhat cigar shaped, didn&#39;t seem to be moving at a great pace. I momentarily stuck my head in the door of the house to tell my friend to come and look at this object, he came out and it was gone. Given the view, which was unlimited, there was no way that it could have disappeared that quick as the time delay was roughly 10 seconds or better. Perhaps it was a satellite close to the hemisphere. It was not a plane and it just disappeared. No noise noted.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I stopped and watched it, thinking it might be a jet - but it stayed in the same spot, behind the clouds, for a number of minutes. The object was extremely far away, but I could tell that it was metallic. I thought I saw it wavering back and forth a little bit, but it was hard to tell as it was so far away. I stayed in the same spot and watched it for about five minutes, at which point clouds rolled over and I lost it. I couldn&#39;t find it in the sky after that point, but the object never fully came out of the clouds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous;  provides no contact information.

The object was no more then 3 to 4 feet across, and vaguely shaped like an hourglass on it’s side. It was slowly rotating and hovering parallel to the phone lines next to the highway. It was metallic with silver and red patches on it. It was hard to tell if it was making any sound because the car windows were rolled up, but no sound was heard through the windows over the sound of the car engine. It was moving at about walking speed but its rotation and movements were extremely regular. We only saw it for a few seconds before we passed it in the car. It was such an odd sight that we have a hard time remembering exact details. On later reflection, we both thought it was odd that we didn’t stop the car to take a closer look, or to take pictures.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I looked up and saw a HUGE sphere in the sky.  It was perfectly still, and made no sound.  I only looked up because of some birds--I wouldn&#39;t have noticed it otherwise--it blended almost completely in with the surrounding sky and clouds, but you could see the edges of it fairly clearly when you were looking straight at it.  It wasn&#39;t reflective at all, and I didn&#39;t see lights.  It was weird--I remember thinking it was almost like there was some kind of computer generated surface on the object that matched it exactly to the color of the sky and cloud cover, but you could see that the clouds didn&#39;t match up on the edges with the sky, and that they were moving a little differently than the real clouds.  I pulled my car over and got out to watch it for at least 15 minutes.  It didn&#39;t move.  I had my young children in the car with me--they had an after sch! ool appointment, so I had to continue on into Lincoln.  For the record, I know what a weather balloon looks like, and this was way too big and the wrong color to be a weather balloon.  I have no idea what it was, or how much longer it was there.  I should add that this was within 5 miles of the Nebraska Air National Guard base, within 45 miles of Offutt Airforce base in Omaha.

Irregular intervals.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Aprox distance: 2-3 miles  I had first seen this flash to the North of Mt adams out of the corner of my eye. I thought it was a meteor. Aprox. 30-45 seconds later I saw another bright single flash a little further south from the first. At this point I asked the attention of my friend 19 year old son, I told him just watch toward the mountain, which was faintly visible in the darkness. It flashed again, this time a little further south aprox. 20 seconds from the last flash. We continued watching, the flash occured again, this time a little further south and slightly higher in altitude. Mind you, this is passing between us and the mountain at this point(also:there are NO roads at that altitude on Adams, I was trying to rule out possible explainations at this point)as we continued to watch there was one final flash, this time, just above and to the south of the summit. This flash appeared to be brighter with the edition of a large streak that appeared to shoot west and upward. This was the last time we saw the object/light. Two days later I saw the Indian Ranger and said briefly what I saw and before I finished he said&#34;UFO, I saw it to&#34;  No sounds or shapes were apparent.<n>

It wasn&#39;t until they lined up in a row and then shortly after created a &#34;v&#34; shape that I thought otherwise. We watched them for at least 10 minutes they would go far away and then come back all the while shifting there positions from close together to far apart to lined up into different configurations. It was weird! I really don&#39;t know what they were, but it peaked my curiosity! I don&#39;t believe in UFO&#39;s, but I don&#39;t know what the heck they were. Thought the UFO community might be able to make sense of it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous;  provides no contact information.  PD))<n>

We saw it leaving heading south at an extreme speed. We tried to reach the saucers speed but it was impossible, it would swerve over to one side and fly across to the other. The night was clear and the moon was half a moon. It was flying @ a lower level than other airplanes or helicopters. The weirdest thing is that I took a picture wit my cell phone camera &amp; it came out blurry but I could see a blurry swerving light. Moments later I checkd the pic again and the image I got was dark and nothing came out:I sent it to my email but there was no picture. The other saucer we saw was a triangular shape with 3 white lights and a red one in the middle. This sightings were all seen around midnight and 1am.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD))<n>

It was, and looked liked like, a window or rectangle floating above the north end of Seattle, WA.  I was on the east side of Lake Washington driving west across an over ramp from I-405.  It seemed visible enough that this would have been reported on the news.  I heard nothing about it.  Therefore, I chalked it up as something unusual but since no one else saw it, it would be like talking to a brick wall if I tried to explain to anyone what I saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n> However, later I talked to someone that saw the same thing quite a few years prior.  It isn’t really anything fantastic enough to report so we both just left it alone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I lost sight of the one I was looking at because of traffic behind me and no place to pull over for a longer look.  But it was there, just sitting in the sky and not moving. It had definite rectangular shaped perimeter to it and from I saw there was clear sky looking through the inside of the rectangle.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Has this type of event ever been reported before?  After reading a sighting by Col. Phillip Corso he mentioned he saw a UFO fly straight up from the ground and through a rectangular opening in the sky and it was gone.  He reported this while on active duty in the army.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((name deleted))<n>

It&#39;s very dark in the driveway, no street light.  I can see lots of stars for being in town.  From NE to SW a huge &#34;falling star&#34; flashed across my upper perihelial vision, since I wasn&#39;t looking directly into the sky.  It had a large &#34;misty aura&#34; around it.  About the size of my fist at arm&#39;s length.  No sound as it disappeared behind the tall hill beside &#34;Castlerock&#34; (lava outcrop).  I don&#39;t know what I saw but it didn&#39;t leave the Feeling in me that it was actually a meteorite - mostly because of that huge glow.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was there for aporx. 3 mins and then it just disappeard.  Then i had my brother come ourside and in like 15 minutes a helicopter flew over head towards were the object was.<n>

It was still the first inning. Pedro Martinez had hit a batter and forced a run in, the Phillies catcher was up. I believe the time was about 7:40 P.M. I went into the livingroom to close the blinds and I saw a square shaped object moving from north to south. I overlook the Verrazno Bridge supporting towers and the object was somewhat above the height of the supporting towers. The object was square in shape and moved at about the speed of a dirigible. Not seeing an airplane in the area, I went back to the bedroom and got my glasses. I thought that the object might be a box kite but I discounted that because of the height. Back in the living room I saw that the object was now closer to the bridge. It was grey with a black design of some sort along the top and bottom. When it reached the area of the tower closer to Staten Island the object turned to its right, to the west, and continued in that direction until I could no longer see it. When it turned I could see that it was narrow. I thought that it might be an advertising banner being pulled by a plane but, as I indicate above, there was no plane in the area. I then thought that it might be a weather balloon despite its shape but a balloon could not turn as it did. I estimate that I am about 1 1/2 miles from the Brooklyn side of the bridge and the object was another 1/2 mile to 1 mile beyond that. Unfortunately, I own neither a camera nor binoculars. The sky was still light as the sun did not set until about 7:55 PM.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

We are a very mature French couple and we did not trust any storie about OVNI&#39;S until this day August 14 2006 at 12.35 noon local time .<n> <n><n> <n><n> EVENT : Going back to our country side by car and after passing the little town of st vallier de thiey located in the south of france above grasse , our attention was attired by a circular metallic gray object flying slowly in the sky at about 1000 metres high above the highest mountain dominating the town .The object was located few kilometers away from us but Difficult to give a real distance . Anyway , the object looked bigger than a regular plane.  Suddenly after few seconds , the object emitted a very bright light wich made us blind for few seconds . After that , we saw him again at the same place and look at each other . but when we looked at him again , he disapeared totally . We looked for it for few minutes but no trace at all .<n> <n><n> <n><n> I must precise that we are in summer time and that the sky was totally blue with no cloud. This object attired our attention because he flew and look differently than what we generaly see . As I flew a little in the past time, I know this was not a plane or a balloon. As we were in our car , we did not ear any noise.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is the end of our 15 seconds lifetime little story  wich we will never forget.<n> <n><n> <n><n> best regards to everyone&#39;s.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Note ; I will send a drawing of the approximate position and shape of the object to the reporting center soon as possible .<n>

The light was long and grew size as light progressed. It was white in color. This encounter didn&#39;t last very long. We ran inside. So I went back outside to see if I could see it again. I did that time it was long and still grew in size as it progressed. Except I saw something that was a disk shape inside of the light. Also, this time it was pulsating green and red.

The moon was just past it&#39;s full phase and lit up the night quite well, making stellar photography difficult.  The park is on the northwest outskirts of my town and the light from it is blocked by trees and low surrounding hills, making for a reasonable observing site.  The nearest airport is 12 miles away at Edinburgh and the flightpath for it crosses well to the south, with aircraft already low on their approach.  Flights practically cease after 11pm.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I was waiting for my telescopes tracking systems to calibrate i was looking to the northeast to see if I could catch site of a meteor or two.  I noticed what I at first took to be a satellite since it moved in much the way satellites do, just fast enough to be noticed and on a silent, straight course across the sky.  However the reason I noticed it so quickly was that it was quite bright, too bright to be a satellite and yet far too fast to be a planet.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I grabbed a pair of 10 x 50 binoculars and followed the light across they sky for about a minute, and the reason for the brightness became clear.  The binoculars resolved the light into 3 lights in tight triangular formation, giving the impression that they were fixed to one craft moving on a southerly course.  The lights were unblinking white and never varied in position, size or intensity.  I was unable to discern what they might be part of, the distance being too great.  I had to return to my equipment for a few minutes and when I once again looked for the object I was unable to find it.  I would assume it was somewhere near the full moon by this time and I would have little chance of seeing it if it were not already over the horizon or hidden by the haze of the town lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I realized it was moving back and forth and up and down rapidly. I watched it do this for 20minutes before I woke my husband. He agreed that is was strange that it didn&#39;t move over a very large geographical area and that the movements were very erratic. Too erratic for a conventional aircraft. I did call the FAA and Kiro T.V. I had no way of takiing a photo of it so the televison station was not interested. We only saw 1 object and it had blue and white and red lights not all visible at the same time. It seemed to hover and then make short up and down and left and right movements.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

We spott|10/30/12|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/093/S93795.html|242|ndxe200608| A friend of mine were returning to my moms home in Texas city, after departing his girl friends home in League City Texas.  We spotted two star like lights that followed us all the way back to Texas City.  No matter which road we took or turned onto the two lights were following us.  We sat in the car for about 25 minutes until about midnight talking about what we had experienced.  The sun roof of my friends Dodge Shadow was open.  We were listening to a talk show about UFO&#39;s coincidentally at the time of all this that night.  I looked up and saw a very bright metallic looking saucer shaped craft. It made no sound whatsoever at all.  It seemed to float and was descending over us at about a 45 degree angle. It looked to be about 40&#39; in diameter, and was no more than 20 or 30 feet over head.  I was so astonished, I could not even tell my friend who had driven us to where we had parked across the street from my moms home what I had seen.  My friend was looking forward and did not see what I had seen.  When I called out to my friend his name, he looked over at me and acknowledged. I was trying to get him to look up, but it was too late. I caught out of the corner of my eyes the last bit of the saucer descending over the tree tops in the yard of my moms next door neighbors house. I finally regained my composure enough to tell my friend what I had seen.  I told him that he would not believe me.   He replied to me the following:  &#34;You are not going to believe what I just saw.  Then he explained that he saw what appeared to have been a flying saucer that headed straight towards us.  It hovered in front of the car, and was also dead silent. It then made an astonishing maneuver and went straight up at an incredible rate of speed.  I told my friend that what we had just witnessed had to be the two points of light that resembled stars, that had followed up all the way from League City.  He told me that we should make a report of what we had witnessed. I told him th! at no one would believe us. I told him that they might want to! have ou r heads examined, and that we did not have any actual proof to confirm what we had seen.  I was not going to go exploring the neighbors back yard in fear of what the apparent Dennison from another world might decide to do to us. The man on the radio said that if you think about extra terrestrial, that they might come to visit you since they know you are curious about them, just as they may be about us. The man said they have an exceptional since of understanding and would know that we mean them no harm, and if we want to see them they would make their presence known to us. My friend and I discussed what the man was talking about all the way from his girl friends house. My friend said that he did not mean them any harm, and that he would like to see them, I told him likewise. So I believe that we got what we wanted to see. My friend and I are night people, and we do not drink alcoholic beverages, or use drugs of any kind.  I was in the military, and I have seen just about eve! rything that the Air Force has that fly&#39;s.  What we saw that night resembled nothing I had ever seen before.  The craft I saw had no running lights and just looked like two saucers highly silver luster ed against a clear night background sky.  It shined no light upon anything other than it&#39;s self.  I have never seen anything like it before or since. Everything I have mentioned in this report is true and as accurate as I can remember what we had experienced. I do not care about what anyone would think of me anymore. I know for a fact what I had seen, and I know that it was real. I am presenting this to you because I want to make this truth known to the proper authorities. The craft I saw exhibited non of the characteristics listed in the description of features listed below. It was just as I have described it in my explanation here. I remember all the details clearly just as vividly as when it had happened back in 2006. I regret that we did not have a camera to take any phot! os.<n>

I do not drink nor take drugs which would interfere with my vision. I hesitated for several weeks to report this anamolous phenomenon because sky conditions have not been ideal -- thunderstorms and clouds, not to mention the urban light scatter that makes observations in Atlanta difficult.  However this sighting has repeated itself a dozen times in the last few weeks and I felt compelled to report it.  In each occurance several hovering lights have been observed out of my bedroom window which faces almost due east.  This view looks out on a main air traffic corridor in and out of ATL (Hartsfield-Jackson International) and PDK (Peachtree Dekalb).  On these evenings I would observe the normal comings and goings of the aircraft, with their landing lights, wing lights, strobes, etc. and what I observed was obviously not an aircraft.  I would see one perhaps two lights hovering in position from just above the horizon, perhaps ten degrees, up to almost directly above.  On one or two occasions the light would appear just after a flash like a strobe,  On others the strobe flash was diffused by a high overcast.  The lights, which varied from a reddish white to a bluish white, would remain stationary for thirty seconds to five minutes, then would fade and in their place a line of lights would appear, usually canted from the horizontal, like a wing making a turn, or sometimes three red lights would appear in the same spot in the shape of a triangle, equilateral or isocoles, then would morph back into a light and move quickly, probably too quickly for an aircraft, to the northwest or southwest, DIRECTLY ACROSS the flight patterns of two airports.  It is extremely difficult to estimate altitude but would not be surprised if they were manuvering over fifty thousand feet.  As I mentioned the cloud cover made it difficult to track them completely across the sky but the consistency of the pattern is remarkable.   It did not seem to exhibit the flight characteristics of an airplane (unless a Harrier jumpjet which is highly inprobable) or a helicopter or a satellite.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

At the same time I was on the phone talking to a friend whom lives in Las Vegas.  During the time we were outside, we spotted the occaisional meteor.  I also saw a satillite.  We were facing North-North East.  From the North an opalescent, round object, approxmiately 40 feet (12 meters)in diameter appeared from the North heading in a Southernly direction.  The sky was cloud free...in consideraton of seeing other aircraft in the sky, I would say it was approxmiately 2000 feet in the air.  At first I thought it was a large helium, party balloon.  After looking at it more closely, I realised it was a round, solid object.  It traveled fairly fast...I would say it was traveling faster than a jet approaching SEATAC. (We live one block from Aurora Avenue (Hwy.99) between a major avenue and a cemetery.)  At the same time I was telling my friend on the phone what I was seeing.  She too was fascinated by what I was telling her and I gave her a &#34;play-by-play&#34; account while I was looking at the object. I watched it until I could no longer see it in the distance.  I felt frightened and fascinated at the same time.  Also, it had a fuzzy glow about it and no sound seemed to be coming from it.  We were very excited to see it and I wanted it to fly more around my area so I could enjoy the moment more.  Tonight, I am feeling very lucky to have seen such a thing.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Object was moving in a box like pattern stopping at each corner for a few moments before moving to another position. Object vanished by dropping below the tree line then moving vertically at an incredible rate of speed until it was no longer visible. It was witnessed by two people. Within 10 minutes of the sighting four military craft were sight. They flew over head at a very low altitude and at a very low speed. These aircraft were interceptor/fighter type planes and were easily visible and very loud.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It travelled much faster than the airplane and up and down like a healthy life support machine, but in a impossible movement for a object moving so fast. It looked out of control. Im sure it must have been caught on the radar of Bristol Airport. It was so close to the plane.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

At about 11:30am, I noticed what appeared at first glance to be a star in the sky.   Then I noticed that it was moving very slowly and stopping and sliding slightly left, then right and stopping in a very solid stopped position - hovering.  I was able to get my video recorder and capture close to 8 second of video of this before it slipped behind trees and out of view.  This object appeared to be very high in the sky, maybe 20,000-30,000 feet.  When I went back and reviewed my tape, I had a chance to have a better look.  This thing was white in color, not silver.  It almost had a shape of a hot air balloon, but it was definitely not, just this general shape, kinda like an ear syringe but thicker on the downward spout of it.  It was very round on top, then an appendage of some type down from the bottom of it.  Very odd.  The downward appendage seemed to angle off at the very tip.  No sound at all.  Not very fast, yet very deliberate moves and changed direction.  I want to mention that one hour later, there was one huge &#34;X&#34; shaped comtrail in the area of this UFO. Maybe airforce had been there to investigate?  Or Maybe since I was paying attention to the skies I just noticed what&#39;s always there.<n> <n><n> <n><n> If anyone else caught this or knows what it might be, it would be cool to compare notes.  My hunch is that it is some type of suveillance drone.  It did have a similar shape to those UFOs recently seen by airforce in Mexico though via infrared.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

On Sunday, August 13, 2006, we were playing our last round at the Witch course on Highway 544, northwest of Socastee, S.C.  Just before teeing off on one of the holes, me and two other people playing in our group spotted a shiny spherical object between us and the clouds.  Upon observing the object, we saw that it would reflect light, then it would not...seemingly in a pattern. The object was on a steady, but not noticeab;e fast track across the sky.  We did not hear a noise emmiting from the object.  We were kind of in a hurry because there were people playing behind us, so we did not keep looking at it for a long period, but we did get a picture.  I downloaded the picture from the camera and found the object in the picture.  It was not reflecting light when the picture was snapped, but it is visible in the picture.  I brought the photo into photoshop, and increased the color saturation, and the object really stands out!! I am attaching the photos. If you look at the photo, you can see a faint &#34;aura&#34; around it like in some other UFO photos I&#39;ve seen...it also appears to be perfectly spherical.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It came from NNW headed ESE as it crossed in front of the moon.  I watched this for about 60 seconds and I couldn&#39;t see it anymore.  It was moving as fast as a commercial jet would move but a jet would make noise and wouldn&#39;t be that bright.  It was like a spotlight, very bright, as bright as the moon.  I also spotted a conventional aircraft moving in a parallel path to the object but about 30 degrees distant.  The plane was obviously a plane and the UFO was obviously NOT a plane.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

At first I thought oh a satillite and continued to track it since satillites travel only in one direction, but all of a sudden the star like object stopped, and reversed slowly for 30 seconds and stopped again and the faint star started to light up the sky into a oval glow and out shined the other stars in the area and flew out to outer space very fast, afterwards a orb like object followed it out too. It was fasicinating and eerie.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

As we watched them we noticed that the number of disk like objects would fluctuate between 3 to 5. The disks were moving in a very eratic pattern and were moving closer to us. The bigger of the objects that stayed in view at all times was a reddish and blue color. The others were bright flashing white lights. The objects would emit beams of white light back and forth to one another. This activity went on for about 30 to 35 min. During thid time there was alot of static on our Baby monitor, and we could not get the objects to show up on our cam corder at all times. They would show up and disappear. When they showed up on the cam corder that is when you would hear the static on the baby monitor. The objects did however show up on our still shot camera.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My Fiancee has lived in Canada her whole life and this is not the first time that she has saw things like this. She has told me about several sightings that she has saw. I have a little over 8 years with the United States Army, and this is definately not the first time that I have saw these types of things in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I was traveling about 77 miles an hour and a glowing disk passed in front of me left to right or west to east and disappeared over the east horizon.  It scared the hell out of me.  The car shook as if a fighter jet had left me in a wake...i slowed regained composure....and it returned from south of my car and passsed over the top and shook the car in a wake again and turned NE into desert floor.  I actually stopped on the frontage road and got out of my Escape and used my digital camera to try and capture it floating over a slight rise in the desert floor.  THe picture zoomed in looks more like several lights and possibly metal between them....it is from a great distance as I could only zoom so far, and I guess that it was over a mile or mile and half away.  It was not a jet.  It did not have sound except the air it displaced and it had no lights other than it appearing to be a giant white &#34;M and M &#34; candy shape, about three to four times the size of my car.  It disappeared instantly while I was taking the third picture.  It was very dark.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD))<n>

I was staying at the Sea Gypsy hotel, which is right on the beach in Lincoln City, OR. I had spent most of my trip just sitting in our room in front of the open window watching waves for hours. My partner had settled into bed, lights off, and I was still sitting at the window drinking coffee. Around 12:30-1:00am I leaned out the window to have a smoke and was looking up at the stars. From the South over the Pacific Ocean I saw what I thought was a bright, large group of stars. As they moved North, I noticed that there were six of these stars, all perfectly 6 pointed in shape, with no tracers from stars look you usually see. There were almost blue they were so white, and WAY more intense that the brighest star. These 6 &#34;stars&#34; were spinning individually, and they all spun in a perfect circle together as if orbiting something. Then all of the sudden they started spinning faster and would rotate from large to small to large to small orbits around this invisible center. It did this while traveling North in a spiral direction. Very hard to describe. Zoomed off faster to the North Pacific and disappeared. I sat there for 2 or 3 more hours and saw nothing like it... although I did see planes and a couple shooting stars, but this was unlike I have ever seen. I get home and tell my sister about this, and she tells me at least 15-20 years ago she and my aunt saw something exactly similar over the open ranges in Eastern Oregon. I know others saw what I saw... I saw 3 people walking on the beach that night, the 1 man alone freaked and yelled up to me to ask if I had seen that too, and he confirmed with the other 2 walkers that they had also seen it. We were not near each other, nor do I know these other witnesses. I also heard from the man at the front desk that other UFO sighting have regularly occured along the oregon coast. Definitely not a plane, rocket, satellie, meteor... or anything else that can be explained! Oh, also I could n! ot see a nything that these may have been attached too, so I don&#39;t know if they were 6 individual or attached to something much large that was invisible to the naked eye! And there were NO tracers or trails from these lights of any kind!<n>

I was facing south east and the light moved from my right to left under the moon and then stopped and went back to my right but this time over the moon. I didnt think it was a meteor or anything. It moved too fast for any of our aircraft or any that i know of. It did not leave any kind of streak or trail, but just a focused light point that was much bigger than a star in the sky is.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I dont think this is an alien spaceship, just something weird in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It traveled at a slight arc at increasing speeds, then it became ever brighter, like a pulse, then it returned to it&#39;s previous size and light intensity until it suddenly disappeared. The whole event lasted no more than ten seconds. We didn&#39;t no what to make of it and were a little freaked out. I can say one thing in that it was not a satellite or a meteor, as I have witnessed both of these, and what we saw didn&#39;t fit the bill.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

While enjoying a vacation in the White Mountains we were standing outside on a deck watching a meteor shower. Then something strange occured from the West there was what appeared to be a plane flying by. I noticed that it&#39;s headlights were on so I assumed it was getting ready to land. Then the &#34;headlights&#34; turned directly at us. They shined at us briefly, 3 seconds, and then the object continued on its path. This is where it got very strange the object stopped in mid air and then changed directions. There was no delay it stopped in it&#39;s tracks and began heading the opposite direction. The object began moving in a somewhat zig-zag fashion across the sky. It would head North, then South, then West almost as if it was climbing stairs. It then vanished. There was no noise. When the headlights were not facing us it appeared to pulsate.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have always been opened to the possiblity of UFO&#39;s I no longer have any doubts.

I saw what I thought was another jet airliner going South, and I squinted to see wings but I could see none.  I also thought it was strange that it headed for a cumulous cloud and went right into it instead of flying around it as all the other planes did.  I looked for a minute or so to see if it would emerge from the other side of the cloud, but it never emerged.  I have no explanation for what I saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Around 7 pm last Saturday, after a 2-hour phone meeting, i noticed a red triangle on my left hand about halfway between the  thumb and the wrist. It looked like a burn. The triangle is exactly 1&#34; wide on bottom side and 3/8&#34; from the center of this side to the top with both ends narrowing into a perfectly very thin point, particularly visible on the left (wrist) side. It looks just like a UFO! The  triangle seems burned on the skin but there is no pain, heat or blistering.  The bottom of the triangle (the widest side) looks or appears slightly curved down just like the shape of a craft seen in profile. Three days later it&#39;s slightly redder than it was that first day but otherwise unchanged. Have taken photos of it. This is not my first unexplained marking but it&#39;s the most artistic one!<n>

What I saw was a rectangle in the sky sitting over Seattle Wa. It looked so obvious that I thought there might be something on the news or people talking about it. But there wasn&#39;t. I told a few people, but you can image the response someone gets for seeing a rectangle in the sky. This was not a UFO. I only had a very short view of this due to traffic and trees. The shape of this was like a rectangle drawn on a piece of paper. It was just hanging there. I could not say the size of it but there was definitely enough size to it to make it easy to see looking across Lake Washington over to perhaps the north Seattle area.(appox. 4 to 5 miles...maybe less).  I was thinking that it might be a gate to another dimension. I am 58 years old and have never reported a strange sighting before. It was a bright and clear, blue sky, summer afternoon. That rectangle was there and I will never say otherwise.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.  PD))<n>

The moment I saw this airplane a flash occurred in this small portion of the sky. I could see a red glowing object half the size of the airplane, just ahead and below the nose of the airplane. The airplane was flying south to north, while the object flew east to west. It seemed to just miss the airplane as it shot downward to a slightly lower elevation. After the two crossed paths, the glowing subsided and the object appeared to take on more of a solid, flat, rectangle shape. Both the airplane and the object appeared to be traveling at roughly the same speed. The object continued in the same direction as I got up to get a better view. I took a few steps, looked back towards the sky and saw only the airplane. The object should still have been visible at the speed it was traveling due to my large view of the sky. I am certain from my viewing angle that this event took place directly above the delaware river/philadelphia area which was three miles away from my vantage point.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

No stars visible in sky. Through front room window facing East I saw a bright Eliptical shaped light low in the Eastern sky just above neighbor&#39;s roof. Resembled aircraft with red and green running lights. Saw red and green light in flashes. Object was not travelling across sky but appeared stationary.Ran outside to end of the block at Esperanza Blvd. and W. Paseo Solana to observe looking Northeast. Object Rose almost imperceptibly slowly in the sky to a greater height gradually changing shape and size,to a round shape,the back to somewhat of an elipse, growing smaller and larger and smaller again (very slowly)  until it appeared to my perspective as a pinpoint of light, like a large star. At this point I saw that there was another identical craft in a line directly beneath the first one but at a lower altitude.These lights did not pulse but remained at a steady luminosity. Second craft only observed during the pinpoint of light phase. Second craft was observed for a good period of time and was definitely present and was not a reflection or trick of the light.Importantly, My position was in very close proximity to the Mt. Whipple observatory atop Mt. Hoplins,directly to the South. Running lights were no longer able to be observed from my perspective when the craft had reached these higher altitudes. Craft apparently were travelling up and away toward the Northeast from my position, since Light apeared to grow smaller, grow larger, get smaller again and then wink out. Observed phenomenon for a good 10 to fifteen minutes from around 5:05 to 5:20 am from  when I came in and imediately noted my impressions. Have previously witnessed Belgium triangular style craft over Marcola Hills (Springfield) in southern Oregon in fall of 1997, and had quick glimpse of boomerang wing craft over this location last year.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

At first I thought it must be a shooting star but it was so different and the more I thought about it the more I realized I had just seen something that had to be a UFO.  I litterally thought as I walked out of my door, &#34; I wonder if I&#39;ll see a UFO today since I&#39;m walking the dog by myself,&#34; and as soon as I thought it, there was this ball of light that stretched itself shortly across the sky like a rod, like a star wars light saber, and then just dissapeared in a split second.  It was right there in my field of vision right when I thought maybe I&#39;ll see a UFO.  The light was crisp and uniform, there was a definite point of origin, no streaking tail or breaking up, just a pure band of luminessence.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I will be sitting in the back of my truck and i will notice that it was moving in circles. So Saturday (8/12/06) i grabed my fathers video camera and I have video of it.. My little sister was there watching it with me when i was filming. but there was no talking. While watching the video it changes colors. you can see it moving like crazy then it will change into a blur, like a haze around it.. I showed it to my mom the next day and my brother and his friend and they tell me that is messed up.. It you look at the North east part of the sky in the holland area you will see it.. matter a fact it was there just tonight, and i am sure its still there.. I am almost positive that it is not a satalight, plane, planet or star. The video that i took there is VERY VERY little movements of my hands, i used my trucks side wall of the bed for stability.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

She simply said look at the pretty lights, they were comming from the lake and our car suddenly stopped.  I tried to recrank the car but noting happened and the radio was on the fritz.  The crafts were directly over head about twelve in all with pink and purple lights underneath.  suddenly they came together above the car and formed a triangle.  Then we heard the jets but we could not see them.  The craft slowly moved out over the lake when we saw the jets emmit some kind of beam at the craft which then slowly pitched to the side and fell out of the sky an into the lake.  the car then cranked, but before i could go about 200 soldiers came from the surrounding woods along with two men in suits who were in charge.  they told us that we were trespassing and we would be arrested if we did not leave imediatly.  I Stated that we were on a pubilc road and the man said i we did not cooaperat we would be killed.

I thought i was halucinating then checked my eyes and looked again and it was still there penduluming back and forth moving forward west like we were but slower, i said to ben &#34;look a ufo a ufo a yellow ball like thing in the sky look&#34; but he refused and was the one driving and i persisted &#34;look look their is a yellow orb in the sky moving back and forth moving forward&#34; but he refused to look he didn&#39;t really think much of my opinions. I never really thought to report it for what can they do and w! e out drove it  and it wasn&#39;t able to be seen, i forsure saw for quite a few minutes this yellow orb and have fathomed my own opinion on it. I was just watching a show on ufo&#39;s and thought a real report as to how this one was moving or whatever could help since they were going through reports. I can or could take a lie detector on seeing this thing mutiple ones actually and this was the only time while traveling or ever that i saw one, and i really saw it, under just the classification a yellow orb, it was to me looking like a orb like i fathomed a being being in it but it radiated light like it wasn&#39;t a craft. It was an orb of like energy, i fathomed that a being could be in it some how super powered and uses like an energy orb to protect it in space, or possibly a supernaturally powered being that is supernaturally activated. Like seriously the powers like flying beings experince in dreams your telling me none ever became supernaturally powered since the dinosaures. My pr! icipal is that to gain the superpowers you have in your dreams! like fl ying you have to be who you are in your dreams, the same ways not thinking about food or drinking since if we talk stricly good and evil it is evil to harm or kill an innocent being and we subconciously recognise that since plants are innocent beings especially seed that get eaten that is evil to eat a baby being. But in anycase you can tell i am making my way to the truly good line of life and not harming any of the innocent plants or animals, and i feel i may have been contacted with how slow it was going for a reason, who ever they are with how much death of innocent beings there is i have an idea we will be hearing from them, they may be really holy beings that don&#39;t eat anything at all and just take water and why they appear as orbs of light is they have gone fusion like the sun with the water in them some type of special fusion from being really holy, and who knows what type of being it could be , maybe one from a group a species that became immortalized and supernatur! ally powered enough to travel space flying and some stayed behind. ANyways as for profacies i feel the days are upon us and we will be hearing more from them, there will be leaders that stand up agist evil strickly like how the baby plant is an innocent baby and it is evil to kill it and stand up for all life and posiibly become supernaturally powered. oh i forgot i did have one other contact. i was at my house and one night i saw this white light jumping from tree to tree and heard abnormal sounds coming from the woods, there are woods off the back of my house at n6c 1x3 and it made a weird eching sound and it looked at one second like a white light body of this baby human that may be wild but looked like a ball baby sized of white light and it scared me it seemed very fast and the weird sound scared me and i can take a lie detector on either of these occurances, it dissapeared and i th saw the light reappear deeper in the woods, i was scared for i know its wrong to smoke ! and i thought it might be a being like made some of the shallo! w crater s on the moon that are wide for such shallowness from fushion meditation and i was smoking and i could heard the leaves move and then their was a creak from the fence like something was bhinde it , and it had been moving between treees in front of me, and that dissapearing move i thought it might have locked on to it&#39;s reappearpoint and was going to attack me for harming the one year old plants leaves when i should be holy for the planet then it made a sound and did the dissapppearing move and i heard another sound from behind the fence  and i pretty much ran in but as far as sky ufo&#39;s that yellow orb thing was the only time but this white light being or glowing being i saw a few times. i think it might be a holy protector of the planet i think that came to contact me to help my life. i saw it a few differernt days, it was white like lightening enery. I wasn&#39;t even thinking of that i had comppletely forgot, but i was thinking it some enlightened animal and it wasn&#39;t a sky uf! o but i am not lieing and i wrote this just like this you got the second on me remembering it&#39;s been like a year or more since then so i dunno how i forgot but i was thinking of just that sky ufo i had seen anyways if this helps you then good. When i went in i was sure to lock my door at night.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I went outside for a cigarette and notice a really long line that resembled a plane exhaust trail, the problem was that my husband could see it too from where he was in Sanford about 10 miles away. It was as far as the eye could see in both directions running in a north-south direction but it just stayed there in a long line. We have always lived near airports and this was not like any vapor trail we had ever seen from planes before. It&#39;s still out there right now as I write this and it has hardly disappated. The wind seems to have no affect on it. It&#39;s really strange. Normally, when a plane goes over you see the trail but it only trails a short distance behind the plane and disappates quickly. This one isn&#39;t doing that. Wish I had been outside at the time whatever it was had passed over. Very strange. Maybe it was nothing but it is just strange enough that I had to post this to see if anyone saw what caused the trail.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

8/11/06 21:10|Indiana|PA|Unknown|2 Hrs|Second night of UFO activity in skys over Indiana, PA. White light seen moving at quick pace|10/30/06|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/051/S51647.html|287|ndxe200608| Second night of UFO activity in skys over Indiana, PA. White light seen moving at quick pace<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is the second day in a row that a UFO was spotted over Indiana, PA around 9PM EST. Friday night Aug 11th 2006 we went to leave my house to go for a walk as we normally do on weekend nights. Upon leaving the house I spotted a very bright light over the east horizion. from my location appeared to be 2 inches from the horizion at about a 30 degree angle from my location and it probably was over a mile in the distance (numbers are a pure estimate, unsure of real distance, height, and angle it wsa at from my location) at first I thought it was an airplane going in for a landing at Jimmy Stewart Airport, which was very near where the object was spotted. However, the object stayed in a fixed location for 10 minutes. Upon noticing this we decided to go find out what it was. We got into my car and proceeded to drive up Highway 119 but did not take the Clymer exit which would take you to the airport. I continued to drive down 119 and saw the object again after about traveling 1 mile down 119. It appeared to be in the same location still, but not sure exactly how far it was from me. We did notice at this point the object was moving, it appeared to be traveling parallel to my car as it traveled down 119. I was headed in the direction of punxsutawney, PA. At this point we slowed down and came to a stop off the sholder of the highway and the object was moving at a quick pace then came to an abrupt stop. I figured I would get back to the airport and see if I could get closer. I turned down the first exit I could find and continued back to downtown Indiana. At this point we lost track of the object because of our location. Upon getting back on to Philadelphia St and proceeding east back towards 119 I took the clymer exit this time and headed towards the airport. When we got there we did not see anything in the sky and decided to return home to see if we could see anything there. At home there was nothing to bee seen, however I noticed an interesting vapor trail in the sky that looked like no plane one I have ever seen. It moved in a very defined line and make very quick turns in a very large S shape from what appeared to be from where we originally saw the object directly over our location and through where town is. I compared them to other vapor trails created by planes that night and compareing the rate of disipation of a known plane one to this, this trail had to of been made very quickly to maintain its definition over that large of a distance. Although a little freaked out we proceeded to go to town to do our walk. At around 9:55 PM while walking down church st facing west we noticed a very similar bright object in the sky. I stopped and watched it closely lineing it up with a power line to detect movement, and it was either riseing in the air or coming towards us relatively quickly. I pulled out my camera phone to try to take a picture and it just flicker out and was now not visible again. We continued to walk towards the Sheetz convienance store near Indiana University of Pennsylvania at this point and the object was lit up again. Once again it was moving towards us at a relatively quick pace. My girlfriend at this point was getting very scared and we decided to get into Sheetz as fast as possible. We ran towards other people who were walking in that direction to at least be near others, at this point the light just flashed out again. We spent about 8 minutes in sheetz before deciding to get back to my car and drive back home, the car was about 3/4ths a mile from where we were now. We started to walk up 6th st towards downtown Indiana and while doing this in the same location in the sky looking towards Indiana Mall the light just flashed back on again and was moving once again. We moved quickly into town which a festival was going on at the time, so there were lots of people around. At this point we lost track of the object so moved quickly to my car, which was in my work&#39;s parking lot about 1/4th a mile away Quickly got home, where the light appeared again over the hill behing my house. At this time I pointed it out to my mother, sister, her boyfriend and her friend. We watched the object for about another 10 minutes as it randomly got bright, dim and eventually disappeared. This is the second night in a row an object was in the skys. The night before (Thursday night) we had a tringular large UFO fly directly over our house at a quick pace, but slow enough to watch it for 30 seconds in detail. The objects seem to always appear in the summer around 9PM in august. It is the only similarity to all the objects I&#39;ve seen in the past few years here, but they are definatly appearing more often now the ever before.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
8/11/06 17:30|Ashford Hollow|NY|Oval|ten seconds|Two flying blips of light caught on video.|10/30/06|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/052/S52011.html|288|ndxe200608| Two flying blips of light caught on video.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My wife and I were shooting stills and digital video at Griffis Sculpture Park in Ashford Hollow, New York, about 30 miles south of Buffalo.  The sky was mostly clear.  Neither my wife nor I noticed anything strange at the time--not until we looked at the video footage later that day.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was using a Sony Handicam on a tripod, taking a shot of a large metal sculpture, zooming out.  A blob of light is seen coming from the top-center of the frame, gets slightly brighter, then fades out quickly.  This first ufo is visible for perhaps a few seconds.  Then, a few seconds later, in the same shot, another blip of white light seems to appear from somewhere behind the sculpture, and streaks toward the left and up slightly, very quickly, lasting maybe less than a second.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A jet plane (can&#39;t tell if it&#39;s commercial or military) is also in the shot, its vapor trail clearly visible.  It seems to be climbing at a rather steep angle of ascent, but I&#39;m not sure.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have the original digital tape and an uncompressed .AVI file of the relevant footage that&#39;s about 40 megs.  Let me know where to send it.  I&#39;d love to have some experts try to figure out what they are.  As an amateur photographer, I&#39;m pretty sure they weren&#39;t lense-flare or airplanes.  The first ufo might have been a meteor or satellite, but the second ufo shot &#34;up&#34; unlike any meteor.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

This is the day after the discovery and break up of the alleged &#34;terrorist plot&#34; to blow up airliners bound from the UK to the U.S.A. Airport security was in the highest state of alert.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Times and altitude are to the best of my recollection. I didn&#39;t make note of the possible significance of this incident until later in that day.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were flying in an Airbue A319 at 36,000 ft. about 2 hours before (east of) Sacramento, Calfornia.<n> <n><n> <n><n> United has Air Traffic Control (ATC) piped over audio channel 9 so you can listen with head phones. ATC called out to another passenge plane who was flying at 33,000 feet that there was &#34;traffic&#34; at his 10:00 o&#39;clock position and about 1000 feet above him at 5(?) miles. The pilot responded that he was looking.  ATC called again and said the &#34;traffic&#34; was about 2 miles and now almost at his altitude.<n> <n><n> <n><n> That he should descend 200 or 300 feet, and to report the traffic when in sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The pilot said he was looking and then exclaimed that he saw him and that he just passes to the left of him very close and that he really saw &#34;him&#34; and stumbled and hisitated like he wanted to say more but held his tongue.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Shortly after that, ATC calls out to &#34;ALL aircraft flying between 30,000 and 40,000 feet to report in, state their altitude and ID themselves, I assume that ment to set a specific IFF code on their transponders. About 10 aircraft called in  and then there was silence for a short while before the normal ATC chatter started back up..<n> <n><n> <n><n> Local Sacramento time was about 09:00.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After thinking about this I thought this may have been the case of an unknown flying object, with no flight plan or nor IFF. Initial thought that a hijacked plane at 33,000 feet rather that a UFO.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I reported this previously but got no response from your agency.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Three lights to begin with. One light on one side and one light on an opposite side. Each light would pulsate and change colors but did not change distance. A third light would somewhat appear in between the other lights but would fade in and out at times and would not be a constant or timed light. The light would move at a very slow speed in a southwesterly direction and would slow pulse and change colors. A very dim out line of the object seemed to make a &#34;V&#34;. There was no noise at all. The lights were directly over our house. Once they started a move in a southwesterly direction the speed and intensity of the lights seemed to increase and before the object made a  departure the lights came together and then went apart to the distance it originally started at and then the departure was  white light and then it very swiftly left heading west and climbing in altitude.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
8/10/06 21:25|Indiana|PA|Triangle|10 Minutes|Tringular object with three lights seen passing from east to west over Indiana, PA at 9:30 PM EST|10/30/06|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/051/S51632.html|293|ndxe200608| Tringular object with three lights seen passing from east to west over Indiana, PA at 9:30 PM EST<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was going to leave my house on Ringneck Ave. in Indiana, PA at around 9:30 as I walked outside a bright orange light was glowing over the trees at a distance of about 5 miles from me in the sky. I thought at first it was a planet in the sky so I stared at it to figure out which one, but I noticed a slight wobble to it. It appeared to be moving slowly towards me. It was in the eastern sky at the time I first noticed it. As I watched I tried to squint to make out anything thinking it was maybe a helicopter, but when I squinted it seemed to have an odd shape to it, and it was not blinking like a normal helicopter was. About 2 minutes later my mother came out and asked what I was looking at, I pointed the object out and said it seemd odd. At this time it was getting closer. At about 9:30 PM at this point the object was getting closer and you could see visible horizontal movement as the object got closer to us. It took about 2 minutes from that point to reach a point where we could see it visible moving at a fast pace. It was completely silent, and almost looked like a cruise ship moving in the sky how it was floating by. As it got closer the front had a bright orange light on it, which is what I assume I could see from the distance originally. I coult also make out two lighter lights behing it tailing it. These lights formed a triangular shape. The shape was an elongated traingle the front was about 3 times the disance from the back two lights were apart. At this point the object passed directly over the house and you could visibly make out a very dark black shape of a trangle with two lights on the back, one on the front and what looked like smaller lights around the side of it as it passed.  It continued to move to the west passing over the hill behind our house. It took about 1 minute to pass from where we could make it out to where it was no longer visible. There was no noise at all coming from the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

This is the day after the discovery and break up of the alleged &#34;terrorist plot&#34; to blow up airliners bound form the UK to the U.S.A. Airport security was in the highest state of alert.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Times and altitude are to the best of my recollection. I didn&#39;t make note of the possible significance of this incident until later in the day.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were flying in an Airbue A319 at 36,000 ft. about 2 hours before Sacramento.<n> <n><n> <n><n> United has Air Traffic Control (ATC) piped over audio channel 9 so you can listen with head phones. ATC called out to another passenge plane who was flying at 33,000 feet that there was &#34;traffic&#34; at his 10:00 o&#39;clock position and about 1000 feet above him at 2 miles. The pilot responded that he was looking.  ATC called again and said the &#34;traffic&#34; was about 1 mile and now almost at his altitude.<n> <n><n> <n><n> That he should descend 200 or 300 feet., and to report the traffic when in sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The pilot said he looking and then exclaimed that he saw and that he just passes to the left of him very close and that he really saw &#34;him&#34; and stumbled and hisitated like he wanted to say more but held his tounge.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Shortly after that, ATC calls out to &#34;ALL aircraft flying fetween 30,000 and 40,000 feet to report in and ID themselves, I assume that ment to set a specific IFF code on their transponders. About 10 aircraft called in  and then ther was silence for a short while before the normal ATC chatter started back up..<n> <n><n> <n><n> Local Sacramento time was about 09:00.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After thinking about this I think that was the case of an unknown flying object with no flight plan or nor IFF.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ar<n>

I presumed it was a landing light since I could also hear the sound of a small airplane which would have been SE of me and inbound to the local airport. The reflected light was extremely bright.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I went on deck I looked up to where the sound came from to look at the plane and I saw a craft which was not at all an airplane.  It stopped making any sound and stopped in mid-air.  I &#34;felt&#34; it was looking at me!<n> <n><n> <n><n> It appeared to hover over a building located approx 200 mtrs away altho I&#39;m sure it was past the physical ridge of the island.  It had a window area which looked like a cartoon version of human teeth; 1 row upper 1 row lower.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It emited a color of red then changed colors to yellow to green to yellow then red. It blanked out all color and moved east (50 mtrs as I saw it) and stopped again and repeated the color sequence.  It moved once more, stopped, and repeated the color change.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It then moved off slow but steady toward Puerto Rico then gathered speed as it left.  It disappeared from my view into clouds.  It made no sound once I had it in my sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The next day I, along with many others, saw 3 water spouts in the exact places of the light changes from the day before.  We thought these water spouts might enter our anchorage and were making preparations to move into the safer pond area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

I looked up at the sky at what I thought was a shooting star.  The object was coming straight down right above my head.  I noticed that it was cylindrical - It looked like a fat cigar kind of shape.  It was very, very bright silver and it seemed seamless. As it was dropping it was going round and round on itself.  It then hung motionless in the sky for about 10 seconds.  It then tipped as airplanes do when they take off.  It picked up an incredible amount of speed and then just disappeared - One second it was there the next it was just gone.  It had no sound at all.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Today August 11 I have noticed heavier than usual jet activity over this area but although these jets move super fast you can see them get smaller and smaller as they accelerate and they make a lot of noise.

The yacht was moored at the furthest end of the river, I travelled there with two friends of mine; all of us are in our 40’s.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We arrived at the boat ramp just before midnight; it was a very clear night, with no wind.  As Whitianga is in the country, the stars there are very bright and we had often seen shooting stars.  The countryside there is very hilly with a mountain range between us and Auckland on the opposite side of the river.  Auckland, our biggest city is about 100km from Whitianga.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I reversed the car down the boat ramp and proceeded to unload my inflatable and the rest of the gear with Barry.  After about a minute I heard one of my friends, Peter yell out.  He said, &#34;What is that!&#34;  Barry and I turned around; Peter was looking at the other side of the river.  We replied, &#34;What?&#34; Because we couldn’t see anything.  Then, after about 2-3 seconds, a huge bright light, absolutely massive, lit up the entire sky for about 2 seconds then went of again, after 2-3 seconds it came on again.  It did this 5 times, including the time that Peter saw it without us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The light was so bright, and covered such a vast area that I could only imagine that a nuclear explosion could cause something like that.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After the fifth time, there was a pulsating light that covered a very wide area of the sky above us and was traveling over us, it was not very bright, but we could see it, and it also made a very low kind of growling noise like a dog snarling, but duller, it passed over us and was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had seen UFO’s on two other occasions, but both Barry and Peter were skeptics, needless to say, they aren’t now.<n>

It looked like the size of a satellite, but moved much slower.  It had no flashing lights, but it had an intense white light coming from it.  Mostly the light was from the bottom, but it would be from the sides as well.  The stranger thing about tonight as opposed to last week was that the object was shinning an intense light downward when suddenly an airplane not very high in the sky was traveling towards it, heading east.  As the plane got further east, suddenly there was no light and the object disappeared, but before it did it flashed a bright light like a flash from a camera.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I see satellites all the time and can definately tell the difference between that and most jets.  This object tonight and last week seemed much slower then satellites.  There was definately no strobe lights of any colour coming from these objects.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I have no know medical conditions (i.e. macular degeneration, diabetes, epilepsy, etc.) that could possible account for my observation.  I hadn&#39;t had any alcohol, nor any other drug (prescription/recreational) substance, nor do I have a history of using any such substance.  I don&#39;t wear corrective lenses and I have really good night vision. I am alert &amp; orientated as to person, place, and time.  I believe this statement is given to the best of my knowledge and of my own free will, without seeking any personal gains.  I feel strongly enough about my experience as to overcome any and all concerns / reprocussions that might arise out of my making this statement.  And, I had washed my car earlier that day so the windshild was unobstructed! I was proceeding East bound on Route 52E just prior to the Regents road off ramp.    I could see military planes in the pattern at Miramar Air Station. I noticed a white light at approximately 2 O&#39;clock middle (not high or low).  The light appeared to be between me and Miramar.  Initially the light appeared to be stationary and looked like a star and then it took off and I saw it start to accelerate at an incredibly fast rate of speed until it was out of sight.  All this happened in less than a second.  I was flabbergasted and I had to pull over to the right shoulder and come to a stop just prior to the exit sign.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have taken three semmesters of Calculus based college Physics and I am familiar with Newtonian mechanics as well as optics, and I have taken the Nikon school of photography.  I am a primary health care provider.  Prior to this sightening I was a disbeliever in UFO&#39;s.  I&#39;ve seen numerous shooting stars, I am familiar with the F-18 Hornet, F-14&#39;s, F-15&#39;s and numerous other Fighter &amp; civilian plane/jet flight characteristics.  I&#39;ve seen missle test flights, and NASA rocket launches.  I solomonly sware that I can&#39;t account for this visual sightening based on any of my life&#39;s experiences.  It wasn&#39;t an optical illusion or reflection or something that can be explained on my perspective in relation to its course of motion.  And, it was traveling at such a high rate of speed that I can&#39;t even conceive of anything going that fast!!!  I don&#39;t know if it is a space ship or whatever it is but I can tell you that it had enough of an impact on me to motivate me to make this report which I wouldn&#39;t ordinarily do unless I think it was pretty significant!  Because it went from a stand still to an acceleration it is difficult for me to explain its flight characteristics as a natural phenomen.  I would say that it is a UFO.  The was no visible trail nor any sound coming from it that I could hear.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous;  provides no contact information.  PD))<n>

8/9/06 05:00|Chatsworth|CA|Triangle|15 minutes|5:40 a.m. 8/9/06  HugeTriangular Craft Seen flying over  Chatsworth, Ca|10/30/06|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/052/S52835.html|314|ndxe200608| 5:40 a.m. 8/9/06  HugeTriangular Craft Seen flying over  Chatsworth, Ca<n> <n><n> <n><n> Hello,  This first sighting of this triangular craft,was on 8/9/06. The time was 5:40 a.m. I looked out my bedroom window, that looks out to the East, and saw a huge bright yellow light, that was hanging in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The light wasen&#39;t moving,so I grabbed my digital camera, that also takes videos. My bedroom, is on the second floor, so I could see this bright yellow light very well.  The distance was very hard to determine,I put it just in front of the mountains.  I don&#39;t have a tripod,so as you know, it&#39;s very hard to capture something in the night sky.  The craft started moving, and I said to myself &#34;come this way.&#34;  I was surprised, it did come my way, straight towards me,  that&#39;s when I started to video this bright light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The digital camera I have, doesn&#39;t give me the greatest quality, but, as  you can see, there is something there in this video. As I videoed this craft flying towards me, I took the camera away from my eye, to see just how far away this craft was,I was shocked to see it was almost to my house.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This story sounds hard to believe, but, it&#39;s definitely is the truth. I&#39;m sorry I had the screen on the bathroom window, because, when I took the pictures of this craft, flying over my head, the flash on the camera was set on automatic, so it went off, and it left me with a picture of the screen,and the reflection of the flash.  But, I did manage to get a good picture of it, from my bedroom window, which also shows smaller white objects attached to it.  The video is also empressing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This craft was silent, except for a very low rumbling, or roaring sound., and the size had to be at least 100 feet in lenght,and at least 150 to 200 feet wide across the back.  It was pitch black,so it does make the size hard to determine.  If anything, it might have been larger.  When this &#34;FANTASTIC&#34; craft, flew over my house and yard, I saw that the tip of this craft, came to a sharp point, and, was not rounded. There were large circular lights on the bottom, that started from just behind the nose, then ran horizontally, across the bottom.  There were 3 or 4 rows of these circular lights. The colour of the lights were of a dim off white, with a tinge of yellow.  There was also, a tiny green light,thatI noticed just off to the right side of the craft,but it didn&#39;t look like it was attached to it. There appeared to be a black void between the craft, and this small green light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The lights didn&#39;t reflect off the bottom,they looked like they might have been recessed,and I could see what appeared to be something, that looked like grill work, or something, that looked like that over the lights. This huge craft crossed the street, and headed West,and as slow as it was traveling, which I failed to mention,was about 25 to 30 miles per hr. &#34;IMAGINE THAT?&#34; What was also incredible, was how it banked to the left to go South, without slowing down, or speeding up.  It was as if it pivoted on the left tip, and came round,so that the front of the craft moved to the South. It continued to fly South, over the top of the high hill, across the street from me. I lost sight of it, as it past behind a tall tree that is in my yard, but I could still see the lights that showen through that tree, as it continued traveling South, until it was completley out of my sight.  If you are interested in seeing the picture, and the video, you may contact me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> SIGHTING:  Chatsworth, Ca  Thank You,  ((name deleted))<n>

We looked up and there was a freaky white (circle) light falling in the sky.   It was way to close to be a shooting star!  It was there and then it vanished behind an apatment building.  The person I was with said that it was a UFO, but just to be on the safe side we both made a wish and put our hands in our pockets, just in case it was a shooting star.  We tryed to call a hotline one hour after it happened but it was out of service....  so I went online and found you.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We are both college aged kids just up late visiting my boyfriend at work....  nothing special about tonight.  All I know is that it was really creepy, and I just want to know if anyone else saw, whatever it was. Bloomington Indiana is the mecca for all freaky migration...  alot of strange things go on here.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

When i went to my car about 50 feet away from the front door of the apartment, which i couldn&#39;t find it and needed to sit down (front passenger side). I looked over at the front door of the apartment because I thought saw someone in the corner of my eyes open the door thinking it was my girlfriend but no one was there. But right above the roof, when i happened to look up(maybe about 20-30 feet from the roof) I saw 2 triangular shaped objects about the size of 3 6-foot man that can fit in a triangle, spinning around each other with a light on one corner of the 2 triangle objects. when i stared at it, i was still blinking my eyes but kept my line of sight straight at the objects trying to identify what kind of object it was. But after realizing that the wind was stagnant and no sound was present except for the air condition that was behind the apartments. I saw the objects slow down from the spinning motion and paused for 1 second and took off to the left going up....quickly, very fast and awakening. then after about 10 more seconds, the wind started blowing for the next 5 to 8 seconds and stopped again. but the objects did not make any noise or sounds.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

At first we thought that the where shooting stars, but they were not acting the same and left no trail behind.We know they are not sattelites we watch for thoes all the time,and they don&#39;t dim from being out of the suns light.They are very fast,and can make extream vector changes. they go dimmer and brighter and seem to know when you are paying attention,they will dim until you can no longer see them. We have seen them single, and also one time two together. Also we have seen them speed up to regular air craft then slow and go a different direction.We have been seeing these in all areas of calgary se down macloud and west off glenmore.and at diffrent times late evening and early morning 1030 pm to 500am .We have herd only a hum sound a few times. Twice in one spot we had a hair raising feeling. The second time we saw a weired white shape or shadow in a feild that was Followed bye two strange noises that sounded like a mix between a horses noise when they breath out and the air viberates off their lips , a throte rummble and a angry snake hiss all mixed in one sound .I stoped lookingmade him role up my window I was scared. We turned the car to point the head lights in to the field. My B.F said that the thing took off at an extream speed through the fieled when he started the car.We could not see it and the feeling was gone we left.The first time we went we were both uneasy like you are aware of bad intent and your body is giving you warning. It was not just fear of unknown.It was a strong feeling to leave it took alot not to speed away it was such a scary feeling. We herd shuffling sounds in the feild and a thump on the fence post near us we left, we were both shook up.We will continue to go out we are planing to bring some friends this weekend.we brought a video camera th! at I had charged the battery all day and tested before we left but it&#39;s charge was gone when I went to use it.I will try again on camera our friend have high power benocculars and night vision glasses not to metion some really bright flash lights. I hope to get some concreate evidence on bothe the lights in the sky and the shape in the field.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I saw the crescent moon and stopped to take a look. I notice some colored lights traveling from the southwest to the northeast.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We have several airports in the area and I see jets flyover all the time. But this was no jet. It was traveling very fast and high and the lights were multicolored and blinking erratically. The object was traveling from the southwest towards the northeast. As it passed over me I expected to here it, as I always hear the jets, but it made no sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was moving in one direction, but not always in a straight line. It would zigzag at intervals between traveling straight. I watched it for at seven to ten minutes when it suddenly blinked and disappeared in a flash before it reached the tree line!<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  One of four reports witness submits in five days from Cross Roads, TX.  We do not know what she is witnessing, but we would be surprised if all four objects were &#34;bona fide&#34; alien craft.  PD))<n>

I was walking so I stopped to see if it was me  or the light moving.  It continued to move for another half second. Then it stopped.  Then in grew in intensity and simply disappeared.  I waited for it to come back, thinking it went behind a cloud.  No clouds.  Lots of stars, but no clouds.  It was the about the size of the brighest star in the sky, at about 45 degree angle.  I held my hand up to just the distance it travelled, about 5 finger widths to the right of what appeared to be venus, (star had a tinge of redish to it).<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I glanced up at them and observed MUCH higher in the cloudless blue sky a jet plane (we are in the Dallas area so there are LOTS of planes). Hundreds of yards behind it a dark orange sphere was following it. At first I thought maybe it was one of those advertising signs that planes drag but then I realized there was no apparent wire and of course, why just a ball and no words? I pointed it out to my husband and just as I was trying to get him to see where it was it just disappeared into thin air. The plane continued on its way. Maybe what I saw was a child&#39;s balloon and it just popped right after I saw it but then why was the motion in perfect rhythm with the plane?<n>
8/8/06 14:09|Fremont|CA|Disk|25 sec.|strange shiny silver object flew fast over the hill, stops, then disappears|10/30/06|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/051/S51593.html|321|ndxe200608| strange shiny silver object flew fast over the hill, stops, then disappears<n> <n><n> <n><n> OK. I don&#39;t know how to explain this. I just saw something fly over the hills behind my house. I usually sit on the back porch in the afternoons, leaning against the screen door, looking at the cows on the hill. 10 minutes earlier as usual I was quietly observing them. Then from over the hill this silver thing flies in a fast, straight line, just over the hill. It kept moving forward a little, but seemed to have stopped and turned around. It stayed in place until it found a direction. It started moving to the right slowly. I was standing up by this time and moving closer to the fence. By the time I got to the fence the thing disappeared. It was gone. It didn&#39;t fly over the hills again, it had already moved a good way out from them. Unless it moved faster than I could see... I saw it and then it disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was thinking, maybe it was a balloon? But the wind was going over the hills in the other direction. When it came over the hills in my direction it was coming fast, then it stopped. It still moved upward and north the last time I saw it. I distinctly saw the shape of it and it wasn&#39;t round, nor was it oblong, it was not the shape of a balloon. It looked like a &#34;flying saucer&#34; with a lid on it. It was flat and shiny on the bottom, and the top looked like an oval cut in half and attached to it. It was definately bigger than at least eight big black cows put together. I saw its dimensions after it flew over the hill and turned around abruptly. It moved to the left, then back to the right, slowly moving toward the Bay and shifting direction, until it disappeared. It was silver and shiny and distinctive in the clear blue sky. There was nothing else up in the sky at that time. Nothing flies that low over the hill in the direction toward my house. I can&#39;t think of anything that would move so erraticly. It sure wasn&#39;t a bird or a plane.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

A co-worker of mine was explaining how rainbows form inside the ice crystals of stratus clouds.  I looked up at the sky and my attention was immediately grabbed by an small object flying through the sky.  It was very small, but I could DEFINATELY identify it&#39;s color and shape.  It was oval shaped...almost like the shape that a ball assumes if you put pressure on it.  It was not as flat as the stereotypical &#39;flying saucer&#39; shape...more round.  I immediately thought to myself...&#34;that looks like a freakin&#39; UFO&#34;!!  I stared and stared as it flew rather quickly across the sky...in front of the clounds.  It&#39;s color was a very dark, steel blue.  I tracked it across the sky with my finger.  My other coworkers were returning from their lunch breaks also.  I was pointing and screaming...&#34;Look! What is that? What is that?&#34;  My coworkers were yelling back at me, &#34;Where? Where?&#34;  I I was freaking out, jumping up and down, yelling &#34;Right there! Right there!&#34;  But no one saw the stupid thing.  I was in shock as it disappeared from sight behind the roof of our office.    I am still in shock that no one saw it.  I&#39;ve been running around the office trying to talk with the people who were out there...and they look at me like I am nuts.  I am submitting this report because I want to know if someone else saw something, or if there was a weather balloon, or jet fighter flying over Lancaster County, Pennsylvania at 1 pm on August 8, 2006.  I know people think I&#39;m imagining things.  I really want some type of affirmation.  I know what an airplane looks like.  I know what jet fighters look like.  THEY ARE NOT ROUND!!  Was it a weather balloon?  Can they travel that fast?  This thing was not floating.  It didn&#39;t hover.  It didn&#39;t start and stop.  It didn&#39;t fly sideways.  It flew in a straight line.  It was fast.  IT WAS OVAL shaped!  It was DARK BLUE!  I am a college educated professional woman.  I don&#39;t believe in extraterrestial abductions and all of that sci-fi stuff.  I would really like to explain this.  I know people think I was hallucinating.  Perhaps I was.  I hope that someone out there saw it also.  I hope that it has an explanation.  If not...then I need to do some serious thinking.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

8/8/06 05:20|Oviedo|FL|Light|20 seconds|On a very clear night, a star-like light flashed three times heading south overhead and vanished.|10/30/06|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/051/S51598.html|325|ndxe200608| On a very clear night, a star-like light flashed three times heading south overhead and vanished.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My job has me working until 1:45am and I don&#39;t get home till shortly after 2. I wasn&#39;t tired, so I stayed up late to work on a computer project. I went outside to the front of my home at approximately 5:15 to have a cigarette. I was standing in the driveway of my home, facing the house (so I was facing east / northeast) and looking up at the stars. I was amazed with how clear it was. Usually I can only see a certain number of stars due to light pollution in my area. This night was incredibly clear though, and I could see constellations I only see once every so often. I noticed an airplane fly by. It was high enough so that you couldn&#39;t hear the engine, but you could still clearly make out the red and blue lights on the wings. It went off into the distance and there it was obvious there were no more aircraft in sight. As I stood there a few minutes longer admiring the stars, enjoying my cigarette, I noticed a pinpoint of light almost directly overhead. This was much different than an airplane. With an airplane (especially at night), you can always see the wing and tail lights which are often red and blue. This was a single white point of light that appeared. It flashed overhead for about 2 seconds, then disppeared. About 10 to 15 seconds later, it appeared again, heading in a southerly direction. It flashed again for 2 seconds and disappeared. Then, after another 10 or 15 seconds had passed, it flashed again. That was the last time. If I had to measure the distance between the flashes, I would say it was equal to the amount of sky that two adult hand widths would cover side by side, extended at arm&#39;s length. I followed the path of the light to see if it flashed again, but it did not. This is what made me even more suspicious because there were still stars in the sky above where the flash would have appeared that were clearly visible. There were no clouds over the house at the time and, again, I was amazed that the sky was at clear as it was. I wondered if I could have been seeing a satellite, but it didn&#39;t make sense that it would be flashing or that it would only flash three times and disappear. The brightness of the flash was about equal to the brightness of Mars or Venus on any clear night. Less than a minute after I spotted the light, I went inside to look at the clock on my cable box. I used this clock specifically because the time is set by my local cable company and it would make sense that it would be the most accurate clock in my home. The time was 5:22.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

At first thought it was a shooting star, see those almost everynight.  But then thought it was an airplane with a very bright light, stayed motionless and soundless.  But the light was in a shape of an elongated diamond, too perfect.  Stared at it for about 20 seconds.  Ruled out flares as daylight was starting to show up, would have seen smoke.  Airport is nearby, 20 minutes away, so airplane landing or taking off, I can hear, but this didn&#39;t hear nothing, had to be up past the clouds, when it went away, it gave off a very bright light, I could see my shadow as if someone was shining a light on me 5 feet away.  Still wondering what I saw was an actuall UFO or a satellite coming down being burnt away or a test military aircraft, either way there had to be other people besides me seeing that.  Am very curious to know what I actually saw though.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

But these craft are training over our skies every night of the week (Exept Sundays) in Sacramento CA. Up in the foothills and the Sierra Nevada range we can see them in formations of two, four, and six over the Central valley. I think it&#39;s because we are at a higher elevation. I THINK THE GOVERNMENT IS ABOUT TO MAKE THIS A WHITE WORLD PROJECT. They are operating without regard to who is watching them. I believe they are manned craft as opposed to UAV&#39;s.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They look a bit like bright stars and Planets at first and tend to wobble a bit when you look at them. But watch for the red tail of light followed by a range of colors that sparkle off the craft. Usually they work in groups of 2 and can sit still for hours, only to move as quickly as 50 thousand miles per hour in a second. One night I watched as more than 8 gathered in a circle in the sky. A lone craft then dotted in and out of visibility across the sky. Each time it reappeared it did so it came back with a flash of light. Almost like a &#34;Top Gun&#34; Training flight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I don&#39;t believe that these are UFO&#39;s. These craft are US Military in their training style and seem to be guarding our coastline as well. I have never seen a beam or ray fired from any of them though.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They make no noise, usually move in a circular pattern, they blink out at times and reappear in a different area within a mili second. Although they appear small, at times they can get close and appear the size of a house.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It is the most interesting right at sun up. One of the lead ships stands like a beacon over the North Valley (Beale AFB?) and waits for them all to gather like children after recess. If you watch very closely, you can see the craft streak across the sky just beyond the Hue of the morning sky to this lead ship. 50 60 thousand miles an hour.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What our Government has in it&#39;s secret arsenal now may be the biggest jump in tech. ever. Anti Gravity machines than can disappear and seem to time travel.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It&#39;s up there,, every night.

Life  is in sea and oceans, on the earth, why it can not be in skyey, where is moisture, sun light, oxygen? I saw like a star which acts as simple living structure (e.g. like a fish): after standing in place it made curved movement and dissapeared. Like a fish in the lake.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

We were performing a surveillance operation. I observed three bluish white lights in a column formation (I would estimate spacing between objects to be 800m and the altitude to be 1600m).  The objects were traveling from the south-by-south west to the north-by-north east. I brought this observation to my partner’s attention.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Our first thought was someone had fired a few rockets, but the altitude and flight path was not consistent with such an event, although the speed of movement was. We watched as the object covered a distance of approximately 50k with consistency of speed, direction of travel and altitude.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were discussing amongst ourselves what they might be when in an instant they came to a complete halt. A fraction of a second after stopping, all three objects blinked and then accelerated out of site (The first appeared to be in a very steep if not completely vertical climb). The second object moved in what appeared to be a level trajectory due east. The last moved in what appeared to be a gradually increasing altitude north.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It took approximately one second for the objects to be completely out of site. We switched to IR and still had no visual contact. Obviously, we discussed the issue amongst ourselves but did not report it to higher for obvious reasons. We have no idea what these objects were and unfortunately where unable to determine a shape.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I was looking out over the ocean and enjoying the stars. It was a very clear night. I saw what I thought was a shooting star.  It was red and moving very rapidly. The only thing that was odd was that it was red (every shooting star I have seen was green or white). As it neared the horizon, the trajectory changed to a horizontal movement from the right to the left. After a second or less it suddenly doubled back at aproxamitly 15 degrees and went back out into space at a speed 10x what it was going when it came in to view.  We both had goosebumps for hours!  It was a amazing experience. I am no longer a skeptic.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

It looked like a snake shaped but it was also horizontal rectangle.  It seemed to have a white circle on one end as it was moving so fast into spirals, figure 8, zig zag, and it was just moving into all kinds of shape as this snake shaped or worm shaped so called star was moving around and jumping around.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have seen this before in the past and it is very curious.   I would like to know what this could be.  It is interesting that it looks like a star but what got my curoisity was the multicolor of it and it seemed to move the clouds as it moved down, down more than a gravitational force I think.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I also see helicopters that fly behind the mountain trees where I live which come late in the night or and early am, and they fly down .   I do not know what is behind these mountain trees, as far as I know it is just mountains but it is curious to me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So, this is what I am reporting, a star that when seen with binoculars is quite different.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thank you,  Vicky<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous;  provides no contact information.

I could not understand what it was, it was not moving, and a reflection did not make any sense.  Then, after about 20 seconds it just...........disappeared!<n>

We noticed what appeared to be a round bright light. It was moving from North to South at a very high rate of speed and at a low altitude, left no con-trail and no other shape was visible except for the light.  The object&#39;s distance from me and altitude made it visible below the top of telephone poles on the other side of the 4 lane road.  It covered the distance between several poles in a matter of seconds. The object then appeared to turn left and upward then disappear.  As we pull out onto Hwy 1 heading south we noticed an object that seemed to be hovering with a strobe light. It would strobe about 10 times real fast then quit for a sec then start over.  we watched it for about 2 - 3 minutes as we were heading south until it started moving in the same direction as the first then it disappeared<n>

I can only report the following.  I&#39;ve attached the Oct &#39;06 Ruidoso News article (Alto, NM, is just north of Ruidoso) for your reference and as a refresher to me, as I&#39;d forgotten the month.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was the night of Sunday August 6th, in the wee hours, so the article is correct in siting August 7th.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It is my (&#34;Alto resident&#34;) friend in the article that saw it &#34;over the Ranches of Sonterra&#34; and my cabin* which was near the theater.  She mentioned it at lunch the following day.  It&#39;s not mentioned and might not be useful to you, but I bumped into a fellow ROS neighbor of mine immediately after hearing about this ufo over my cabin over lunch.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I don&#39;t know what possessed me to mention it to my neighbor (I guess I was excited) but she said a friend of hers had just mentioned seeing a craft over residential Ruidoso.  This friend had been on a late night dog walk and saw what appeared to be a lit structure on their narrow, dense, tree lined street.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first glance, they thought it was new construction with lights on, then realized a structure was not possible there.  My neighbor said they took a second look and saw an overhead door close.  That&#39;s all I know about that siting, and don&#39;t know if it was even reported.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The local paper told us they waiting until October to post the article, until they &#39;had room&#39; and after they&#39;d heard from Holloman AFB. Oh, and the article is cut off in the 1st column on the 2nd page.  The omitted line read something like &#34;....from as far away as Phoenix.&#34;<n> <n><n> <n><n> *PS:  For the sake of full disclosure, I experienced contact in June 2009, 3 months before I sold this very cabin; loud humming craft overhead, greys in my bedroom and all.  Not relevant to August 2006 and I did not report that either, but I can personally report no strange dreams or contact or anything unusual on the night of August 6th 2006.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Hope this helps.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((END ADDENDUM))<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date is approximate.

It sounds like nothing I have ever heard before, almost like a low pitch storm warning sound. It is coming from the woods which are pretty much desolate and vast. I called 911, and the operator told me a few officers reported hearing it, but none of them knew what it was. None of our neighbors could figure out what it was. I am a cement mason, and I am famaliar with the sounds of different machines, and the sound is neither machine nor human. It happens at random times throughout the day but at nighttime it gets real eerie and loud. The other night I came home at 4am and it sounded like it was above my roof at my house. I was seconds away from calling the cops. I do not know what is back there, but to my understanding if it is not human or machine, it just might be E.T.. or Jesus???<n>

They came in because they saw 3 different flashes of light &amp; it scared them. I (the Mother) thought it might be lightning so I went out to the pool to extinquish the tiki torches surrounding the pool when I looked up &amp; noticed 4 very bright &#34;stars&#34; in the distance. Because I swim at night alot, I know that I&#39;ve never seen these stars before. They were in a straight line &amp; were changing colors. (red, blue or green &amp; white)I went inside &amp; brought out my binoculars for a better look. They were stationary for about 10 minutes &amp; then I watched one of them move (very quickly) higher that the other three &amp; stop again. Then I noticed 2 more to the West of the other 4. I observed them for several minutes. Occasionally one of them would rapidly change positions so that the line was no longer straight. After about 30 minutes of watching this I went back inside the house because the fire ants were biting my feet &amp; ankles &amp; my kids were very frightned. The objects were quite a distance from my home so I couldn&#39;t make out a shape. I live approximately 10 miles from the gulf coast in the country away from any bright lights &amp; the objects were to the South appearing to me to be over the gulf. I wish I could have gotten a closer look but my binoculars are not very good &amp; my children were upset. I did not see the flashes of light that the kids had seen before I went outside. I separetly asked both of them to describe the flashes to me &amp; they both described the same thing. They said it was just a bluish white flash of light like a camera&#39;s flash bulb going off only much, much bigger. If someone wishes to contact me, I don&#39;t have any objections to that.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

As I walked out of my house, I was greeted by a beautiful full moon which was slightly orange at the time in the NE sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I walked to the rear of my yard, I noticed what I originally thought was a very large planet in the N sky (about the same size as the moon that night).  About a minute or two later, I returned to the spot where I seen the &#34;planet&#34;, and stood and watched it for about another minute.  Just then the circle pulsated very brightly, and made an arching movement in the sky.  As it was making this arching movement, the circle got smaller and smaller until it vanished which took approxiamately 5 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The sky was very still and clear that night with no wind or clouds.  Total time of observation was about 4 to 5 minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

What was unique about this was the color was blue green. When we got home I looked at the object thru our binoculars. Now I could see that instead of 1 light it was composed of 4 lights that were rotating. The object remained almost stationary for the entire sighting. At 23:15 it dropped below the tree line and I couldn&#39;t see it anymore. I have about 15 minutes of video of the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object seemed to be about 30 degrees up from the horizon. As I watched the object, a bright star rotated into view close to the object and then set during the hour and 45 minutes of observation.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

When the motion of the object moved it closer to me, i got a chance of seeing the bottom of this object when i relized it was a round shape because it had rectangular lights aligned in a circle arround the bottom of it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> one further realization was that the manuevers it was doing (although possible to a stunt plane) were not possible, even so when the object appeared at the end of a &#34;pendulum swing&#34; to have dropped straight down.<n> <n><n> <n><n> AS far as the color i coudn&#39;t tell since the object was seen at night, and it&#39;s lights were seen clarly but not the color.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As far as Sounds, this object didn&#39;t make any sounds.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was going really slow - and the lights were (i believe) blue &amp; white. I went outside &amp; looked at it &amp; heard NO NOISE at all! and even though it appeared to be going slow - it covered a large distance in just a couple minutes it was out of sight. Imagine a hammerhead shark - the &#34;wings&#34; were curved like a partial C, and then the &#34;tail&#34; part was very very short. The wings looked ot be 4 times as long as the little stub of a tail. the lights alternated, one color then the other. It may have been green &amp; blue - very bright. I went outside thinking it was a plane of some sort, and we do have lockheed martin &amp; other military contracter factory -type places, but after seeing it I didnt think it was a plane at all. There was no electrical problems/interruptions - but the satellite went out - as it has been a lot with no weather conditions to cause it. If you want to talk to me let me know &amp; if i miss the call i can call you back (no need for collect call).<n> <n><n> <n><n>

They were all white/grayish, and not extremely bright nor very dim. I slowed down and rolled down my windows and opened the moonroof to take a better look, as I was on a deserted street. One reminded me of a cassette tape turned on its side; rectangular with an even row of what looked like square holes or dark rectangles. The next one was very round and was the same color as the one before it. The next was harder to see, as it was further away, but it appeared to be the same as the first one, only slightly shimmering (possibly due to vantage point and shimmering city lights?). After quickly arriving at my destination, I parked the car and asked my friend if she could see what I saw. By that time, the first object had disappeard, but she could see the second and third objects in the same position they&#39;d been in before. We were on our way somewhere, so we quickly lost sight of the other two objects and do not know what happened to them.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Some of us ran over, and the object that they were looking at had disappeared by the time we got there, but one of the guys had taken a small video of it, and some pictures on his digital camera.  It was yellow, like a light, and seemed to jump around in the sky.  Up, down, to the left, right, diagonal, etc.  This was during the day, and the sun was out.  Then it just disappeared, as if someone just turned off a light.  It sort of resembled the shape of a jellyfish.  Two of the people said that they had seen it earlier in the day.  I was waiting to hear about it on the news, but I never heard a thing.  I&#39;ve never seen anything like it before.  Of course, a few of the people thought it was a reflection of something, or a military something or other.  I just don&#39;t know.

My house is on the fringe of the countryside, at the edge of Wayne county and bordering Washtenaw county.  I was alone when I witnessed this.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Just as I opened my garage door, my attention was caught by a flash of light. It was brighter than most meteors I’ve observed before.  This object entered from the North at about 20-25 degrees above the horizon.  It had a plasma type trail wider, brighter than anything I’ve ever seen and it was traveling faster than any known object I’ve witnessed, such as meteors or conventional propulsion craft.  The air had a slight electrical discharge and a very faint crackling sound as it appeared out of nowhere in the sky as it headed from the North to the South covering about a third of the horizon in travel distance, over what would be from my direction looking North East toward I-275 and the area North East of that highway.  This would be in the areas of Livonia, Southfield on up toward Warren, Michigan.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first I thought it to be a meteor, however, I instantly looked to the end of the flash and noticed a shape appearing that of a craft about a mile up or more, possible disk shaped with a corona type discharge around the craft, making it look like it had some sort of field generation effect around the craft. From my vantage point it had stopped in midair, just pass the I-275/M14 interchange for about 1-2 seconds, then traversed back the way in came, but much slower like an aircraft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It zig zagged  to the East direction, went straight up, zig zagged some more in the same direction and again went further straight up, taking what appeared to be an orbit like a satellite with the same speed as one, heading toward Lake St. Clair, Canada.  The entire event lasted about 15-20 seconds.<n>

8/6/06 02:00|Trout Lake|WA|Formation|2 min|triangle pattern of stars moving from South to North|10/30/06|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/051/S51562.html|349|ndxe200608| triangle pattern of stars moving from South to North<n> <n><n> <n><n> Hi My Uncle lives on Guler Rd in Trout Lake Washington. Our family has been coming to Trout Lake since the family settled there in the many years ago. We always camp in my uncles back yard during the Trout Lake Fair and on Friday/Saturday nights we play guitar, sing, and stargaze. Often we are up until 2:00 or later watching for shooting stars and we did so again this weekend.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Sunday morning 8/6/2006 at 2:30 am my wife and I were in uncle&#39;s yard looking up at the Milky Way and facing east. The weather conditions were perfectly clear and great for watching shooting stars. Out of the South appeared a triangle pattern of stars from behind the trees at the edge of the yard. This formation about was about eighty degrees up from the horizon and slowly began to cross our wide open view of the sky from South to North in the direction of Mount Adams.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We first thought this was our eyes playing tricks on us because the lights were the same intensity as most of the stars except they were all three moving North in a formation that moved without deviation of speed or shape. This was not a solid object but rather three points of light as we could see the other stars in the middle of the triangle as it moved.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This was a large Triangle, lead across the sky by two stars and the third one following at spacing slightly larger than the other two, but exactly equally spaced in relationship to the first points of light, then forming a triangle.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Since there were several friend and family all camping in my uncles yard I began yelling for a friend Buddy to get up, knowing he had just went to sleep in the back of his pickup truck next to us. He got up and came to where we were standing and we asked him what is that? Do you see what we see? He said yes, those three stars are moving!  At this point the formation was crossing the Milky Way but still bright enough to watch them. Buddy watched them with us until they were blocked from our view by trees to the North. The entire time it took the three points of light to cross the sky took about two minutes. I have looked at the night sky for years and I have never seen anything like it. It left my wife and me with an uneasy feeling about how weird it was, and then we went to bed<n>

At first we thought is was a plane, upon closer inspection and gut feeling, something wasn&#39;t right about it. Then our attention was diverted to a new form. It was a glowing, blinking redish orange orb far off in the sky. We thought it was Mars but again something wasn&#39;t right, so we decided to go home and get a camera, and it began following us, and dissappeared 2 or 3 times. We then got the camera came outside, and from how far away it was, it seemed to have jumped a length of five miles around to our north. We took a few pictures of the red one, and noticed some extremly odd shapes appearing with it, then suddenly it refused to show up on the camera.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I put my head out the window.  I couldn’t believe my eyes.  The sphere made no sound going faster than my car.  I would say 100kmph.  Once the shpere over took me it just vanished.<n>

My little Toyota is parked in behind the fourplex of my street in the alley. I was looking up and seen a star glow a little brighter than the other stars. It disappeared slightly behind some clouds. Then it reappeared. It then took off like a shooting star. The object must have been very high up. It had a full color spectrum to it as well (Like the color of an ordinary incandescent light bulb). No noise, as it was way too high in the sky. When it took off, the object streaked across the sky. It is the second unusual sighting that I have had in this town. The first one happened in August of 2001.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Earlier in the evening on this date, a large dark rain “cloud” had moved in from the west, moving northeast and was positioned in the Northern sky.  Within this rain “cloud”, which looked to be several thousand feet in the sky, and maybe several thousand feet in area, my coworker and I saw what appeared to be three white lights which appeared to be just skimming the underside of the cloud formation turning in a clockwise direction.  What I mean by skimming is how I think a light source would be observed just inside the bottom of a cloud formation without exposing itself to anyone from the ground.  They were more like seeing a light source in a fog or haze if you can imagen a view like this.  They were white and dim in places and brighter in other places as they were traveling closer and further away from our angle of view. The three lights were in a triangular pattern circling and synchronized with each other, meeting in the middle of the triangle formation moving in a clockwise direction.  Imagen three circles in a triangular pattern with rings touching each other and you can get an idea of these lights.  My coworker and myself watched these three lights for about twenty minutes before we decided to get back to work to finish up the night shift, which ended at eleven thirty. During this time while we were both looking at this event we were also scanning the horizon trying to find any kind of light source such as spot lights or other lights coming from the ground in this area which could have been projecting these lights from the ground. We were unable to observe any ground effect lights which could have been causing these lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Of course this cloud could have been smaller or larger than described.  There was nothing really to reference this cloud’s actual size that we could see in this area to give us a true indication of its size, but from past experience observing storm clouds and rain clouds like this it appeared to be very large in area as well as height.<n>

Was me and a friend. She is the one that spotted it. At first it looked like a pin point of bright light almost like a airplane headlight. We continued watching it until it came into focuse. We both noticed its color, white metallic or sliver metallic color. We both seen that it didnt have fins or wings nothing like an airplane at all. Then we noticed that it was rounded almost pill like, we both then said a cigar! We watched this thing just glide along, no sound at all was present. The back ground was in residential neighborhood. Like stated we were in the hot tub. This object was low enough to give us this detial but not low enough to tell if there were people or windows or writeings. Although to me it seemed almost solid. Also noticed that the object left no trails like a plane.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was over the street in front of my sisters House and over houses in the residential area. When I first spotted it…it gave a bright White Light. So bright it almost was blinding as I was sitting in the Hot Tub. My Friend’s Birthday was that day and she was there to also witness it after I pointed it out to her. After 30 seconds or so we seen this Long Rounded at both ends no wings no Tail, no Chemtrail (Smoke) that I could see, and no Wire or antennas plus just real &#34;LONG!&#34; I didn’t see any writing of any sort. It seemed to be moving slow or just gliding through the air, but at that size and bulk it could have been going much faster.  It seemed to be solid and a bit metallic white.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was also no noise that it made. This Cigar shaped craft was flying really low. It was 70-85 feet in the air just over the tops of the tallest trees The Tallest trees being 45-50 feet tall. It was a sight no one would forget. I watched this craft for 4 and half minutes! Watching it with my friend. It was around 5:40 pm.. There were only a few clouds, and when it reached a cloud as I watched it go behind the cloud, and waiting for it to reappear it just was gone. No it wasn’t a plane or a Blimp, Weather balloon, or swamp gas. Any more information would be wonderful. Thank you.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have also seen this craft before with my sister but she refuses to get involved. Hope this helps.<n>

At the time of the sighting i was on top of the Windsoir Wheel which is a ride similiar to the London Eye at the time i was at the very top of the wheel.

It was the only object visible, remainder of sky was a consistent morning grey.  I observed it move very slowly. It was extremely large.  I went and awakened wife.  Together we watched it move for several minutes, when it became obvious it was not a plane, far too large, or a planet, movement lateral and then vertical to line of vision we went and got binoculars.  What a shock.  It was a huge circular shape with lights evenly spaced aroung entire circle and appeared sky grey inside circle.  At one point on top of circle  was a brilliant light ( what we were observing with naked eye) that almost gave the appearance of a diamond ring with the light being the diamond.  We took turns observing this for over half an hour. Occasionally the huge light seemed to change position sweeping over the surface of the circle. We also got a compass and lined it up with the object it was just a hair east of the northeast marker at about 60 degrees. Toward the end of the sighting it appeared to either break into two like objects or be joined by another larger but lilke object approachin from behind the first. It vanished quickly moving away from our vision.  Most amazing was its size---it had to be incredibly large!!!!!!!!!!!!  There may hve been some magnetic disturbance, we had a very difficult time stabalizing our compass.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It may have lasted 1 to three seconds. My first thought was lightning, but the sky was clear. My second thought was, someone had an extremely bright spotlight, but this was a pure white light. I walked to the front gate (my yard is surronded by a privacy fence)in time to see a rather large fireball with a long trail of sparks or burning debris and a long plume of smoke which lingered for about a minute or two. The last thought to cross my mind was a plane on fire and about to crash. The object appeared to be at 2 o&#39;clock high and about 60 degrees to the northeast. The angle of entry may have been approximately 10 or 15 degrees. It may have entered over Lake St. Lair or just north of Windsor, Ontario, as I am only 9 miles west of the lake. I am curious to know if this was space junk or something else and if anyone else had seen this fireball also, would it have showed up on airport, or Doppler weather radar? I checked with the National Weather Service in Pontiac and an Astronomy website, but neither had any reports on that morning.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was around 4:30am when a huge flash of light lit up the sky and we all looked up and saw this trail of smoke probably a couple of km long.  This smoke trail was (30,000ft Plus)very high in the sky.  Then the smoke started to disappearing (the was alot of stars and it was a clear sky.)  But then a star started to move westward direction and very high speed.  On a clear day you can see those tiny jet planes very high up and moving. This &#34;star&#34; was moving at around 8 times that speed until we couldn&#39;t see it any more.  The Flash startled us and when we saw the smoke we thought it was a comet or something that burned up but that &#34;star&#34; made it feel like it was something pretty unreal.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

We observerd the lights for approximately 3 to 5 minutes.  The object/objects appeared to be of high altitude, emitted no sound, and were approximately the same light magnitude of Denebe, or Vega which were nearby.  Myself thought it to be two seperate objects in formation.  The other two witnesses thought it to be one object with smaller, dimmer lights running in a line between the two main lights.  We observed the object/objects until they either disapeared into some cirrus clouds or dimmed out.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I thought at first it was an airplane light and the airplane would have been very low and close but there was no sound. The light was bright and intense for about 5-10 seconds and then it dimmed...not out but dimmed. The light then proceeded eastward into the sky. I was watching the trajectory carefully as a plane would have disappeared along the horizon at about a 3 or 4 oclock heading but this light moved at a much higher level 1 or 2 oclock heading. The light just faded into the clear sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Somewhat like thunder the the sky , It was a burst of the brightest blue light i have ever seen in my life. then it was gone i looked out the window to the left of me and there was 4 round balls of light in a line like this ( \ ) you could tell there was a object behind it but it disapeared so fast i could not make it out.I came home and called the federal avaition department in washington and they said that several piolets and people reported seeing it and that it was probley a meteor . Well im sorry i dont belive that ,I have never in my life seen anything like this and it scared the crap out of me. And just like i told them im not on drugs .<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Suddenly, my older daughter and I observed 6 brilliant, globe-like lights in a (stationary) semi-circular formation. The formation was several miles away, above the mountains. You could have blocked it out holding up three fingers. There was an open space on the lower right hand side of the formation. Three seconds, and it was gone. I would calculate from a distance, that the formation was the size of a Ferris Wheel. Considering that this was in a rural setting, there is nothing that would cause this type of visual effect. Strange as it was, I felt the event important enough to report.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

They were whitish in appearance, not shiny or bright white. There was no sound and no contrails. They were moving slowly from SSE to NNW. After viewing them for about 20 seconds I ran to get my husband (who is an aeronautical engineer) to see them, by the time we returned only one was visible and it was soon obscured by trees, I believe the other one was already obscured by the time I got my husband out there, he was not able to locate the last one before it disappeared into the trees. There were large cloud formations all around and the ground temp indicated by my thermometer was about 97 degrees. There was no wind. Obviously I have no idea of the altitude of these craft. I would also like to say that I worked for the Air Force for 27 years and I know an airplane when I see one, these were not airplanes!<n>

I caught the red light - so I was at a complete stand still.  I was facing southwest.  The sky was relatively clear.  I noticed this grey egg shaped object - flying west to east.  It had no wings - no tail.  At first I thought it was a helicopter - but it did not have the necessary parts (main rotor, tail rotor, etc.) - it was egg-shaped.  It wasn&#39;t a plane - it had no wings or tail.   I was at the stoplight for approx. 2 minutes.  In that time, it flew from my right(west)to my left (east)and continued eastward.  I am not able to determine speed - I did not hear any unusual noise - no was there any trace of a trail - there were no lights or beams coming from it either - and there were no other aircraft around it.  There was a woman in the car next to mine - she rolled down her window - I know she saw it - her mouth was wide open - and she stuck her head out to view it.  There was no time to share information - as soon as the light turned green I had to move fast.  I called the San Francisco Chronicle and reported it.  I have scanned the local papers and even Googled ever since -  but it apparently didn&#39;t make the news.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Altitude seemed to stay very constant. The object had a red blinking light on the bottom and a white one on top, was oblong shaped, not far off from a cigar shape. There were also blinking lights around the entire craft. We ruled out helicoptors, blimps and other objects becuase of the time of day and slow speed. Maybe we are wrong, but it seemed to just hover slowly, making it&#39;s way west, north west.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I&#39;ve ruled out planes, satellites, comets and meteors, and even! halluci nations as i was accompanied by a friend. this leaves only the things of &#34;fiction&#34;, either something man made that has been kept out of public knowledge or something made from an older, more intelligent species, who are probably here to try and stop us from killing ourselves and our beautiful planet. this has been a memory that will always remain at the front of my brain, i still think about it almost every day.  in fact it effectively changed me from a hopeful skeptic to a full fledged believer. in less then a second.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

As I was admiring it and the moon a blinking light caught my eye and as I was staring at it I was wondering if maybe it was a plane. After I put my dog in the house I ran back outside to look again and thats when I notice there was 3 of them. At first they were all flying in a triangle then one of them disapeared. So here I am watching the remaing 2 ships, as far as I could tell they had red and white blinking lights which went around in a cirle. The lights were blinking quite fast as they went across the sky. I looked like they were deliberately flying at the same speed with one of them flying slightly behind the other but higher up, the other was flying ahead of the other but lower. But the were definitly flying together. I don&#39;t know if they were trying to find a place to land or not because they soon disappeared behind some trees. I was outside watching them for about 45 mins. I thought the light were blinking way to fast ato be airplane and I have never seen 2 planes flying together like they were.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Under a clear sky filled with stars (or at least as clear as it gets in the Los Angeles area) I looked straight up, as I often do, for a panoramic view, and to scan the sky for any oddities or any airplanes. Suddenly, the burst of what appeared to be the tail of a small comet, or shooting star, shot across the sky, very high up, and from a thumbnail perspective, left a trail perhaps three to four inches long.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This was a bright fiery white burst and by all appearances, was indeed a shooting star, as far as I could tell. However, it is noteworthy because they are relatively rare in the Los Angeles area since they cannot always be spotted from beneath the suburban and urban skies. This one had a long tail and left a trail of sparks.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was nothing to obliterate my view and the appearance of this is apparently what I saw.

You did look but didn&#39;t seem too impressed.  We were in a big herd of people so it wasn&#39;t the best location for stargazing.  Anyhow - I&#39;ve been on this UFO kick the last week.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Today I searched for a UFO sighting database and then searched for the gorge. and found this comment:<n> <n><n> <n><n> 8/3/06 00:00<n> <n><n> Gorge, WA<n> <n><n> Light<n> <n><n> 15 - 20 Minutes<n> <n><n> UFO at a Dave Mathews concert at the Gorge in George Wa.<n> <n><n> 10/30/06  . .<n> <n><n> <n><n> I knew it was not a plane.

I at first thought it was an airplane, but the object circled in a way that an airplane cannot.  The lights remained stable in relation to each other as the object moved.  It was high enough that at times one or more of the lights were hidden by the clouds.  It moved more like a kite than a plane or helicopter, yet the lights were large enough that I doubt a kite could have held them at that altitude.  The object moved in a straight line, curved, stood still, moved up and down.  There was no sound.  After about five minutes it disappeared behind the tree line, and I did not see it again.  I do not know how long it was in the sky before I first saw it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am a forty-five year old white female, a teacher, college-educated.  I have never seen a &#34;UFO&#34; before.

A friend and I were lounging in my pool, just chit-chating and I was looking up and began to focus on what I thought was a bird.  Then I realized the bird wasn&#39;t moving; I stood up and really began looking at this thing which looked like a dot in the sky.  My friend couldn&#39;t see it at first, but when she focused in at exactly where I told her to look, she said, &#34;yes, yes, ooohhhh, that&#39;s weird, what is it?&#34;  It wasn&#39;t until I got the binoculars that we could see that it was sort of dome or bell-shaped.  It was really far away and we couldn&#39;t make out an details.  We watched it for about a half an hour, then the night sky faded it out. Wonder if anyone else in the area saw it.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I mentioned this to my friends that night - most sad I&#39;m crazy or I made this up and one did say that it could of been an asterroid. I only wish my camera was available, and if it was, I wasn&#39;t fast enough to get the photo.  It was amazing! Please get back at me regarding this issue. I would like to know if this WAS a UFO.

It was high in the sky, so at first I thought it was possibly a commercial aircraft. As it began moving overhead, it began to slow down noticeably. At this point, I called to my wife to watch with me. Once it was directly overhead, it stopped entirely. It was at this time that I noticed that the red light was surrounded by four white lights. If the red light was a square, the four white lights would be at the corners, one light at each corner. They were high enough that I could not tell whether they were physically touching or simply in close proximity.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The five lights hovered for about thirty seconds. Then, simultaneously, the four white lights shot off in separate directions, each one traveling toward one of the four cardinal compass points. They moved fast enough that after only a second I could no longer see them, but slow enough that I could track their progress until my view of them was blocked by surrounding trees and houses.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The red light remained stationary for another thirty seconds to a minute, and then vanished. When I say &#34;vanished,&#34; I don’t mean that it moved off, or that it faded away. It simply disappeared, as if someone flicked a light switch.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I’m sorry that I could not describe the shape of the objects.

They just lit up slow one after another like a traffic stop light. These lights were so bright I thought the lights were going to continue on down into my neighbors back yard.

The weather was warm and the sky was clear of any clouds. I noticed a jet passenger aircraft crossing the sky from the southeast headed northwest. I could not estimate the altitude but the aircraft was fully visible. As the aircraft moved out of sight, I noticed a silver object in the sky, crossing over the aircraft&#39;s flight path and moving from northeast to southwest. The object was at a much greater altitude than was the aircraft and the shape was impossible to make-out, although the closest guess would be round. The object continued to move across the sky and left no contrails or exhaust clouds. I continued to watch the object move off. My home is near the landing pattern for a large international airport and I am used to seeing commercial aircraft of all types on a daily bases, but I did find this sighting as very unusual.It is actually the first time that I have seen something that I must say was unexplainable.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

The object was a very bright white slash of light about the length of arc that a dime would subtend at arms length.  What caused me to be very surprised at the sighting was that I could detect no wings or tail assembly.  It was totally cloudless blue sky and no contrail was observed from this &#34;object&#34;.  Just after noticing this the pilot came on and announced that we had leveled out at our cruising altitude of 31,000 ft.  This meant that the object was considerably above us in altitude and if at 5 miles distance would likely have been at well over 40,000 ft - and unusual altitude for a commercial flight in good weather.  In any event, the object paralleled our course for about 2 mins and then appeared to receed to the north without ever changing the aspect ratio of its profile....thus it changed direction without appearing to turn as does an airplane.  I was able to follow this bright light until it completely receeded from sight about 2 mins later.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

In the center of the town is Offut Air Force Base, so perhaps the crafts that I have been seeing are somehow military-related.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Lately, me and several people I know have been seeing strange lights in the sky. The first occurence happened on probably about the tenth of august. My friend was in a park with his girlfriend, and they were staring at the sky, looking at stars that were out. Suddenly, their attention was drawn to a bright light that was hovering in the sky. It seemed to dance around in the sky for a few minutes. My friend then noticed several aircraft approaching the light. The light then took off directly into the sky and dissappeared from sight. The aircraft that had chased the light away then flew a grid in the sky and flew off out of sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Since this date, Me, my girlfriend, the two people stated above, and two of my other friends have seen strange shape-changing craft in the sky, all sightings occured on the same road, Harlan Lewis road, known as Base Lake road to the locals.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The first occurence I witnessed was on about the 18th of august. Me and my girlfriend were driving home and making a turn onto Harlan Lewis Road. We saw a helicopter approaching in the distance. As we drew closer to the helicopter, we thought it was changing shape. We were soon driving under this aircraft, which now resembled an X with several flashing lights on it. It stayed as this shape only while directly above us, then changed into the shape of an Airplane, and it changed the pattern of its flashing lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The second occurence what on the 23rd of august, when me, my girlfriend, and two of my other friends were driving down Harlan Lewis Road. One of my friends pointed out a helicopter that was flying not too far from us. It then flew behind some trees, out of view, and when it emerged from the other side of the trees, it had changed into the shape of an airplane, and also changed its light pattern and color. The other friend in the car didnt pay any attention to the sky during this, so he never saw anything. But everyone who did see it was 100% convinced that the aircraft changed shape.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Also, all of the described objects above made no sound at all, as a plane or helicopter would.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was zig-zagging very rapidly, in a way that no normal aircraft could have done. I woke up my husband who also saw it. We could not see the shape of the craft itself, just red, green, white light and its unusual movement.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

I actually feel frightened as I type this report.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I remember it was really late at night most likely around 3 a.m in either July or August of 2006, I remember this because I was still on my summer vacation before I left for college.  I remember my mom was taking our dog outside to use the bathroom and I went out with her.  I remember there was a bright light and our dog became very afraid.  I remember looking up and seeing what seemed to be a diamond like object with the upper triangle shape being larger than the bottom.  I remember there being lights on the object which were very bright.  I also remember being chased by creatures, this is where I became the most frightened, it seemed like a nightmare!  I remember running in our front yard with my mom away from the creatures which had large heads with particularly big foreheads and they were wearing white dress/nightgown type outfits that fit them very loosely.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After running I don&#39;t remember anything after that except for waking up in my bed. I&#39;ve yet to ask my mom about the experience because part of me would be horrified to find out that she remembered some of it too. I would love to believe it was a dream because of how fearful I feel when I think about it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

And i seen what looked to me as a moving star, so i kept an eye on it, and noticed two more of these &#34;Stars&#34; following at the same speed, making a perfect triangle. It moved at a pretty decent speed, and turned slightly i watched it until it disappeared behind the clouds. Was thinking if it could be some planes in formation, but decided it couldnt have been. Due to the fact that it stayed in a perfect triangle shape the whole time even while it turned, And the lights never blinked, they were a solid light, unlike planes, which have blinking lights...<n> <n><n> <n><n>
