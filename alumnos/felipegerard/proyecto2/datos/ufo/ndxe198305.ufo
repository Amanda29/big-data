5/31/83 08:00|Muskegon County (Northern part)|MI|Disk|30 minutes|We observed a large, round object "hovering" over the highway in late may of 1983.|2/18/01|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/016/S16357.html|1|ndxe198305| We observed a large, round object &#34;hovering&#34; over the highway in late may of 1983.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was late May in the Early 1980&#39;s. My cousin and I, both 13 at the time, observed a large round &#34;saucer&#34; type object over the highway while staying at a nearby campground. The object was observed while gathered around a campfire. We were singing songs with approximately 10 other &#34;campers&#34;. It was about 8:00 in the evening. Someone noticed the object in the sky and we all stopped singing and became entranced with the object. It was very Large, perhaps 100 yards wide, and had lights all around it. (It looked like a &#34;UFO&#34; looks in most hollywood movies) The object just hovered over the highway and campground for what seemed to be a half hour or more. In that time no one said a word and we all were motionless and entranced with the object. The few cars that were on the highway at the time the object appeared had come to a complete stop and no other cars appeared. It seemed as tho time were standing still ...other than the fact that we could plainly see the object and that we were aware of our surroundings. After the object began to move away, everything went back to &#34;normal&#34;. The singing was started again and the cars on the highway took off. No one mentioned the object we had just seen. Later that night, I woke up and got out of our tent to use the restroom. I then observed the object several miles away in the sky, did my business, then just went back to sleep. My cousin and I did not discuss this at all until approximately 5 years later. (and have since discussed it about every 5 years or so) We both recalled seeing it and all the same details of the &#34;sighting&#34;, and, to this day we are 100% convinced that we what we seen was most definitely some form of &#34;alien&#34; spacecraft. We did not see little green men and don&#39;t recall being &#34;abducted&#34; but we are sure this happened and would like others to know!<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

5/28/83 21:15|San Bernadino|CA|Disk|10 minutes|Disk shaped UFO appeared at over a concert in Southern CA.|7/5/08|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/064/S64255.html|2|ndxe198305| Disk shaped UFO appeared at over a concert in Southern CA.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have been searching online and cannot believe that no one has ever actually reported this. This was possibly the largest mass sighting of a UFO ever. In May of 1983 I flew out to San Bernadino, CA to attend the US Festival 83. It was a very large 3 day concert featuring some of the biggest names in Rock music. While attending this show on the first day, I heard someone say they saw a UFO, I looked but didn&#39;t see anything at that time...I believe that it was about 2 or 3 PM but it was 25 years ago now and the exact times are a guess at this point. I watched several bands and then it began getting dark. I believe that the Australian band Men At Work were playing when I noticed a Dark metallic disk shaped object hovering about 25 yards from me just below the low cloud cover we had that evening. It just floated there silently for approximately 10 minutes. Many people attending saw this object (one girl even began screaming) and even the singer for the band made some comment about the object between songs. Then the disk silently began to rise at a very slow speed and disappeared into the low cloud cover. I wouldn&#39;t even report it except that there is photographic evidence taken by a photographer from the concert and it is on a website that commemorates the 3 day show.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.

I LOOK OUT THE WINDOW ABOVE MY BROTHERS BED AND SAW THIS HEAD AND BODY HOVERING LIKE SUPERMAN. I STOOD THERE STIFF; ALL I CAN SEE WAS BIG BLACK EYES AND A LARGE HEAD. THIS THING WAS WAVEING AT ME! NOW I NEVER KNOW WHAT THIS THING LOOKED LIKE, BUT WHEN I SAW PICTURES OF IT I KNEW WHAT IS WAS, EXACTLY WHAT I SAW. I JUMPED OFF THE BED, GOT BACK INTO MY OWN. I YELLED AT MY BROTHER TO WAKE UP, AND I SAID LOOK AT THE WINDOW. AND HE DID AND HE STARED AT IT FOR 45 SECONDS, AND HE GOT SCARED AND TRIED TO WAKE UP MY DAD. MY DAD SAID GO BACK ASLEEP IT PROBLY A CAT. MY BROTHER AND ME WERE SCARED WE SLEPT IN OUR PARENTS ROOM FOR THE NIGHT. NOW ME AND MY BROTHER NEVER TALKED ABOUT IT SINCE, UNTIL TEN YEARS AFTER, I ASKED HIM ABOUT A HE TURN WHITE AND A FEW MINUTES LATER HE LOOK AT ME AND WAVED THE SAME WAY THAT THING I SAW. AND I GOT SCARED BECAUSE THE NIGHT WHEN IT HAPPED, I NEVER TOLD HIM IT WAS WAVING AT ME! SEE I THOUGH SINCE I WAS SO YOUNG, I WAS SEEING THINGS.

5/20/83 21:30|Valley City|ND|Other|15 minutes|An object comprised of 4 or 5 metalic orbs in a row, moving West to East, and returning every 5 minutes following a parallel path.|5/4/04|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/036/S36688.html|4|ndxe198305| An object comprised of 4 or 5 metalic orbs in a row, moving West to East, and returning every 5 minutes following a parallel path.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A friend and I were walking through a park in the early evening of May, 1983.  We were both 17 year old high school students, and just strolling and talking together on a warm, clear evening.  As it got dark we laid on the grass to watch the stars.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We saw an object moving from West to East --- seeming to be at a similar altitude but faster speed than a commercial aircraft.  However, it was visible against a starry sky, seemed larger than a jet, and it had an obviously different shape.  The object was comprised of 4 or 5 metallic balls connected in a straight line, front to back.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What really caught my attention was the fact that it would move across the sky from our left to our right and disappear over the right horizon, only to return in five minutes or so from the left horizon again --- but higher in the sky.  This happened maybe four times --- each pass starting higher in the sky.  It gave the impression of the object possibly mapping the earth.  And the fact that it always went left to right started my friend and me on a discussion of the possibility of there being more than one craft versus one craft circling the globe at an incredible speed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This sighting took place in an extremely quiet, rural town of 7,000 people.  If a jet came overhead or a truck passed on the interstate on a quiet night you would hear it.  This object made no noise.  There was also very little light polution in our location.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have never heard another account of a craft shaped like this one --- several orbs in a row.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

5/17/83 05:45|Tallahassee|FL|Unknown|10 minutes|Faint light zips back and fourth across sky|7/16/06|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/051/S51205.html|5|ndxe198305| Faint light zips back and fourth across sky<n> <n><n> <n><n> While standing outside with my dog, I noticed a light in the sky which looked to be moving quite quickly due to it&#39;s apparent FAR distance. The light was very faint and at first glance seemed to be a satellite, just a pin-prick gliding in a southerly direction away from me... as I watched it, it&#39;s brightness seemed to fade and then suddenly started jerking around in the sky- It seemed to be VERY far away, as I said earlier,(Like a sattelite in orbit) and was making 90 degree turns and sudden stops... it was very impressive as well as the 10 minute duration of the display. This continued untill a SECOND light came across the sky towards it, though this time it was most definetly an airplane of some sort with trademark blinking lights and flying in an even and steady path... as the blinking light of the air-plane approached the jerky &#34;UFO&#34; light, it instantly darted downward and over the horizon, while the air-plane continued on a straight easterly path. I observed this looking south/south-east from the north of Tallahassee, Florida.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

We exited the vehicle (a 1979 Datsun 210) which is when I saw the object moving across the sky. I previously was in the back seat and could not see what the others could see.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object we saw moved very slow, about 15 miles an hour, and did not have much sound to it. It was at tree top level (about 100 to no more than 150 feet above) Lights shot from the pointed end to the back of the object and then again to the forward point in different colors. It made a low humming sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As it passed over us, we manuvured around the tree&#39;s, backtracking from where we had come from to get a better view of the object. We then ran to see it from around the tree&#39;s and the object had now dissapeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Cars were now coming and we ran back to our car, jumped in, and left the sight area. None of us ever forgot that experience.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

We were stopped at a light and in the distance less than a quarter of a mile away we see a spacesship suspended above a reataurant.  There were rectangular shaped windows with a bluish light shining thru the eight windows. within seconds a honing sounded and the craft moved back and disappeared within seconds.  We failed to report the incident, but later learned that a police officer witnessed a similiar event.  The only reason I am reporting this years later is to find out whether or not other people from the N.Y. area witnesses this phenomenom.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I watched a program 3 years later on ufo sightings and it was reported that a number of witnesses reported spacecraft in and around Conneticut, Long Island, and Westchester.<n>

We were crossing Waterloo Bridge,London when we were halted by traffic.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As we sat waiting suddenly to my left a space craft, disk shaped and silver in colour appeared to just drop out of the sky and hovered in front of us to the left of our car. It was huge, hovered in a tilted position, at this point i could see windows all around the craft like portholes, i am sure something was looking out.At the bottom of the craft i noticed a kind of eluminous blue light, like an electric blue colour but softer. I looked to all the people crossing the bridge. It was as though some of the people were frozen. The ones that were frozen were the ones who were pointing up to the craft in amazement. The others appeared not to see the craft at all. These people continued on but appeared slow, it was almost as though time was standing still, like a photo. Suddenly it just vanished. Just shot off and was so fast that it was like magic. I was in shock i looked at my boyfriend and said &#34;Did you see that&#34;. He asked me what, he had not seen it, which was amazing as he was the closest to the object. I then looked at my friend and said &#34;Did you see that?&#34; She looked terrified and said &#34;Yes&#34;. I told her i was glad she had seen it too as if i told people that i had seen a flying saucer they would think i had  gone mad. But the fact that we had both seen it made me feel more comfortable. My friend refuses to speak about this event to this day she acknowledges that we saw what we saw but doesnt wish to discuss it further.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of the incident is approximate.

5/10/83 23:15|Bremerton|WA|Triangle|5 seconds|Triangular-shaped object moving in perfect silence in the night sky|5/12/11|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/081/S81193.html|10|ndxe198305| Triangular-shaped object moving in perfect silence in the night sky<n> <n><n> <n><n> This incident happened many years ago.  I did not report it at the time, but wrote down my observations and kept them in my personal records.  This is what I wrote at the time.  All of a sudden I&#39;m hit with this urge to go outside and look for the Araki-Alcock Comet.  No sooner do I locate the Big Dipper, where the comet is supposed to appear, than I see something quite different and quite inexplicable.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Soaring silently across the night sky is what appears to be a single object, or perhaps three objects moving in tandem. It moves due north at a very rapid speed without making a sound. I wait for a time to see if there are any sounds of jet engines.  There are none.  All is silent.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What I actually saw were three faint points of light suggesting a triangular structure.  The lights are grayish, like no aircraft lighting I have seen before, and they are steady - not pulsing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> All three lights move at the same rate of speed.  One is in front and two are directly behind, horizontal to one another.  The three together suggest the &#34;therefore&#34; symbol used in philosophy.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The eerie thing is their rapid steady speed and their total silence.  And their dimness. Also - if the object was moving at the same altitude as an ascending jet (from Sea-Tac Airport) it would have to be enormous.<n> <n><n> <n><n> (Two days later, I wrote the following)  I still can recall the incident vividly, and in retrospect I can see that my description of it was somewhat jumbled in my attempt to get it down quickly.  I feel I should add, or rather stress, the following points:  Whatever I saw gave the impression of being a single triangular object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was a clear and starry night, at least two or three hours after sunset.  When the object came into my field of vision, I was standing in a short driveway that passes directly in front of my front porch.  I was facing north.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was the object&#39;s motion that initially caught my eye, for it made not a sound.  It was almost directly overhead, traveling at a steady high speed from south to north.  I watched it until it disappeared behind the branches of a large cedar tree in the front yard of my neighbor&#39;s house.  The object was visible to me for a total of no more than five seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My initial impression on seeing the object was that it was a single, solid triangular-shaped craft.  Only later, after examining the possibilities, did I also realize it could have been three separate objects moving in perfect unison, with each separate object representing the three points of the triangle.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I still believe it was most likely a single, triangle-shaped object of a rather impressive size.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After the object disappeared from my view, I waited for a time, listening for the sound of a jet engine or engines.  It never came.  There was nothing but silence.<n> <n><n> <n><n> For the next two or three minutes, I went out and watched the same area of sky where I had seen the object. It never reappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> (I am a journalist and news reporter - in other words, a trained observer.  I did not report this incident at the time it happened because the Internet was not available and also because I thought it would jeopardize my career, which was just starting at that time.)<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain anonymous; provides little contact information.

5/5/83 19:45|Riverside|TX|Circle|15-20 seconds|A red and orange ball of light above the trees.|6/12/07|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/056/S56521.html|11|ndxe198305| A red and orange ball of light above the trees.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A single orange and red ball in the sky was seen by two other friends, my brother and me, while walking up the road returning from fishing in the evening.  It appeared to be about the same brilliance and color of a road flare, producing a consistent discharge of flickering light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The thing just sort rose up from behind the trees or maybe off the horizon but it seemed close (approx 100 meters).  It was silent and kind of danced around in a slight ‘zig zag’ pattern bobbing up and down to the right before changing direction left, then leveling to a straight line and blinking out.  It was at what seemed about tree top level in altitude but it was really hard to determine.  It was strange looking at it.  Judging the true distance and altitude was kind of tough because it looked unreal, literally, like ionized gas, or a hologram.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I don’t suppose this is relevant but we were all engaged in very a heated debate discussing the possibility of intelligent life originating elsewhere and the chances of its traveling here, two on one side, one taking a more neutral stance and one the opposite, shouting religious and scientific contentions to support one or rebut the other.  At least one other witness can corroborate and the other two probably would if they could be located; although one was stating disbelief in the whole UFO phenomenon at the time of the encounter.  Despite that strange irony I to this day state, that the object remains simply unidentified.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

Traveling it late evening, from Santa ana Mex to Hermosillo Mex (actual point of sighting was about 110 miles south of the Arizona Mexico border.)i Remember being quite angry that i was on this trip and was looking at the night sky (to the west) when, all of a sudden a Massive formation appeared to the west of the hiughway we were on. i am guessing the formation had to be at least 100 miles long it covere dteh whole western sky....it was in the shape of a football and transpererent what we could see was the outline of it...it was like the threads of a football were traced in a blueish white light my uncle and i were the only ones awake...but as soon as i saw it i yeled LOOK LOOK! everyone woke up and saw it...my uncle stopped the car and we watched..as it was stationary above the silouette of a long mountain range..we could not believe our eyes...it did nothing but just sit there...no movement or color change in the light then after about 5 minutes it simply dissappeared..it did not move at all..it just, vanished. after it did a few seconds later to the southwest a flash of light called our attention as we looked in the direction there was nothing..just then a cascade of lights...like sparkles from a firework display as they come back down to earth appeared in a cone like fashion..like something had crashed the lights fanned out at the top and came to a point below..this happened for a split second then dissappeared behind the mountain range..i am only guessing that these were two seprate objects but ic could have just been two occurences of the same object...nonetheless this happened over 15 years ago but i remember it clearly..strangely, when i ask my family members if they remember the inbcident they dont...they give me a look  like im a crackpot but i know what i saw and they did too no other memory in my life is so cle! ar and p recise as this memory becuase i knew it was important. even as a child. i have spoken about this experience to people. they seem to think that it is impossible even to UFO believers..they state that the sheer size of the object i described was just plain silly (im gussing it was about 100 miles long it almost spanned the whole length of the western sky! it was absolutely huge)i have also searched the internet for similar accounts but have never found one.<n> <n><n> <n><n> also, we could not hear any sounds at all..and we were the only ones on the higway (this highy from Santa Anna to Hermosillo is about 120 miles long..even now it is very remote, back then there was nothing at all for miles and miles).<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date may be approximate.

Mon attention a été attirée par le bruit d&#39;un hélicoptère de l&#39;US AIR-FORCE. A son bord, un militaire équipé d&#39;un télé-objectif. En regardant dans la direction qu&#39;il visait, j&#39;ai vu décoller 3 soucoupes, à quelques centaines de mètres de taille supérieure à un 747. La forme était celle d&#39;une madeleine retournée (gros renflement de l&#39;hémisphère inférieur). La matière n&#39;était pas celle des avions normaux, si brillante, on aurait dit de l&#39;opale blanc laiteux ou peut-être de la céramique.

5/1/83 21:00|Chesterfield|VA|Cylinder|2-5 minutes|The date of this sighting is unknown, so I did best guess. This is among many many sightings I've had as a kid. This is the most memora|5/11/05|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/042/S42560.html|14|ndxe198305| The date of this sighting is unknown, so I did best guess. This is among many many sightings I&#39;ve had as a kid. This is the most memorable.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Coming home from church on a, probably, Sunday night, I was riding in the back of the car with my sister. My mother and father were in front of car. I was about eight years old. I was watching the night sky, looking for more of what I saw alot of, bright lights that would chase each other through the sky and come together again in a huddle.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Now, I did not see these bright lights every night, but on occasion along with the very frequent meteorites, I would see these bright objects. I&#39;d often ask my father what they were. I asked him if jets or helicopters in the military could do that. He&#39;d tell me, no... and that he had no idea what they were.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This night it was a full moon out. I was looking out my window and my sister was gazing out of hers. I was looking at the moon when I noticed a light off to the right of the moon blinking. It was more than one light, in fact it was a few rows of lights that were of varying color. Then, I noticed that I could see the lights reflecting off of a metallic surface. I also noticed the entire shape of the craft was cylindrical. A flat cylinder much like the same proportion of a tin can of cookies. It was hovering over the tree tops. It was, I noticed, above the trees as high as the trees were tall.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The strange part was yet to come. I was excited to finally see one up close! The craft moved to where it was slowly moving along side the car over the tree line. In my point of view it was getting closer to the full moon. When it got just in front of the moon two beams of light lit from it, much like a car&#39;s headlights. The craft slowed to a stop. The wierd thing I remember about the lights is that they stopped as if hitting some invisible object. I cold actually see the ends of the light beams. Then, the two beams crossed over forming an elongated &#34;X&#34;. The craft then slowly moved back the other way and finally out of sight as our car got further and further away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My sister to this day remembers it. My parents only remember the strange lights we&#39;d see, I don&#39;t think they actually saw this event, but they remember me continually talking about it. I know that strange craft fly the skies, folks.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Over the years I&#39;ve talked with many people who have told me what they&#39;ve seen. Sightings in Charlottesville... Waynesboro (one I saw on here, I swear that I&#39;ve talked to a lady about.. the one that talks of the spinning rod and ring over a person&#39;s house)  I can&#39;t claim that &#34;aliens&#34; as we think of them, exist. I think it&#39;s very possible, but what I do know for sure is that there are things in the skies that are not usually seen during the day that fly. Crafts of some sort, no doubt, that someone does not want us knowing too much about. Hey, keep up the information, the research, too many people know all of these things are true. Never stop your pursuit of the truth.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I often wonder why there are alot more science fiction movies and shows coming out in the past 10 years? Anyone else taking notice  it?<n>
5/1/83 19:00|Washington County (rural)|MS|Diamond|2 hours|Diamond shaped craft sighting followed by missing time  500 Lights On Object0: Yes|3/19/09|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/068/S68839.html|15|ndxe198305| Diamond shaped craft sighting followed by missing time<n> <n><n> <n><n> In the spring of 1983 I was driving to through a rural area of Washington county, in Mississippi to see my father and his brothers, who were having a semi-annual get together in a cabin in the woods. I was 16 and planning on stopping by for a few minutes on my way home from work. I was within a few miles of the cabin when I saw a light in the sky, peripherally, to my left. It was bright white with a smaller green light just below and seemed to be diamond shaped. It was descending rapidly, but not straight down. It arced slightly in the direction from which I was coming. It disappeared behind the trees very quickly, the entire sighting lasted only seconds.  I can’t say how far away it was from me, but it seemed to be approximately a mile.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Simultaneously with the sighting my car suddenly died. It coasted to a stop on the dirt road. There were no houses nearby, and I was so upset about being stranded in the middle of nowhere that I wasn’t really concerned about the strange lights I had seen, and assumed I was just having car trouble. The last memory I have is my hand on the key, turning it in the ignition to no effect. In the next moment (or so I thought at the time) my hand was still on the key but a feeling of disorientation and confusion washed over me. I knew immediately something was wrong but I had no idea what. Instinctively I tried the ignition again, and to my intense relief, it started right away. I started driving in the direction of the cabin again, feeling quite shaken but not knowing why. When I arrived my father told me about the electricity going out in the cabin and while I don’t remember why, I had the impression it had been an odd event in some way. But I wasn’t concerned until I gathered it had happened a couple of hours before hand, which prompted me to look at my own watch. I was stunned to see it was about 2 hours later than it should have been. I quickly made an excuse about feeling ill, and I did feel nauseous at that moment, so I could go home. Right then I felt an overwhelming desire to leave the area, it felt extremely unsafe being there. Strangely though, I felt no qualms about leaving my father and uncles there, I felt no threat to them at all.<n> <n><n> <n><n> For a long time I tried to convince myself that I had somehow fallen asleep at the wheel, and imagined the whole thing. I told no one what I had seen, sure that they would think I was mentally unstable. A few days ago, some 26 years after the event, I told my husband of many years of what had happened to me as a teenager, and his unquestioning belief in me has led me to explore my experiences further.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Although I didn’t consciously dwell on what had happened to me, it did affect me. For the next several years after the event I was unable to sleep unless the bed was pushed against the wall and my back was against the wall, literally. My anxiety levels were sky high, especially at night. I had frequent insomnia and nightmares, a problem that continues to plague me to this day. My most disturbing nightmares all have the same theme, involving the extinction of mankind at the hands of an alien race. I know this is not a memory of any kind, but a manifestation of deep seated anxieties that for some inexplicable reason , I never tied to the event until I spoke about it with my husband.<n> <n><n> <n><n> To this day I have no memories whatsoever of what happened to me during that missing 2 hours. I currently hold a masters degree and enjoy a fairly wide breadth of knowledge but have never been able to come up with a reasonable explanation.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

5/1/83 17:30|North Kansas City|MO|Other|2 minutes|Something Above Us that Day|12/12/11|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/085/S85158.html|16|ndxe198305| Something Above Us that Day  Okay, I&#39;m actually going to say this just because I know what I saw was real, and 2 other  people saw it. I haven&#39;t told anybody about this, really, because I saw it as a child around 8 yrs.  of age.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am an artist and have always had a very creative imagination...but I don&#39;t believe in  ghosts, and I dont believe in anything I can&#39;t figure out.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I guess not understanding as a child, it was easy for me to overlook or dismiss what we  were looking at...  But always wondering in the back of my mind, I now am an adult with  children, and I scoff at the unexplained.  I call it the un-understood. I never have nightmares,  and am very mentally organized about what I understand.  But this, memory of when I was a kid  still stands out with no explanation. I remember it well, even watching my father freak out.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It must&#39;ve been like 1983, driving northbound toward North Kansas City MO.  It was my  father, my brother &amp; I singing...as the song ended, we all looked at each other still laughing, in an old fashioned Ford truck.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was then, that I saw something- or I guess we all kinda looked up at the same time..and  saw what seemed to me as a round airplane hovering above our truck. (of course I was a kid  and didnt know what it was)<n> <n><n> <n><n> My dad yelled out, &#34;Whoa,! Do you guys see that?&#34; we were like, kind of taken off guard, but we answered &#34;YEAH!&#34; because there was definitely something huge,  and hexagonal shape with a cross of blue or green lights. but it was only above us so, we could  only see the bottom of it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The lights were in a plus shape surrounded by a hexagonal or octagonal shape. We stared  at it for what seemed to be the longest red light ever.  Then it went up, up, still we could only  see the bottom..and then it flew away (south west) so fast behind us, that we couldnt see what  the heck it couldve been for sure.. but now I am sure that what I saw, I have never seen again,  nor have I ever seen anything fly that fast ever. Im sure my father and brother wouldn&#39;t mind  validating my story, and I would be glad to take a polygraph.  This is the only thing I have ever  seen that I could not explain.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This may not be a big deal but I know it&#39;s real. Sorry to have wasted your time if it is of no  help.  For us, it was the ultimate &#34;UFO&#34; experience.<n>
