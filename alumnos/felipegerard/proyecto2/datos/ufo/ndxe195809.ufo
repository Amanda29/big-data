9/25/58 19:00|Phelps County (rural area)|NE|Disk|3 to 5 min|Big object approached across field at dusk, stopped nearby, then abruptly flew off.  ((NUFORC Note:  Two witnesses.  PD))|12/7/06|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/053/S53793.html|1|ndxe195809| big object approached across field at dusk, stopped nearby, then abruptly flew off.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Noticed a light moving very slowly at the far end of a flat farm field while parked facing east on a dirt road at a rural intersection waiting for a friend to meet me.  It was so low that I assumed it was a farm tractor working until it got closer and there was no sound (quiet late dusk with car windows open, wind calm, warm).<n> <n><n> <n><n> As it neared at perhaps 5-6 miles per hour, the light was no longer showing on the huge dark oval and it still appeared to be just above ground level, and I realized crickets and other night sounds stopped.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object drifted to a stop near a large old tree about 400-500 feet east of me along the road. Relating size to the old tree which was perhaps 40 feet tall, the object was easily 3 times taller and at least 10-12 times further across than high...a smooth oval with a flat bottom, too dark to find any detail at all.   But no dome on top  It just &#34;hovered&#34; for a couple of minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I heard a car coming before headlights appeared over a small rise in the interesection road.  The object began to move in its original direction (south) but rising and the dark became a white light again as it silently accelerated, and the night sounds resumed as it banked to a southeasterly heading.  The light got smaller and smaller and disappeared into the distance in less than a minutes (still climbing at an estimated 30 degree angle.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The approaching car was my buddy, and his observations of the part he saw matched mine.  We discussed it excitedly as we drove in one car to a nearby town, and we did tell our dates a very abbreviated version.  They didn&#39;t react much, probably because we were so matter of fact about it, and we never mentioned it to anyone else. I don&#39;t remember even thinking of it for quite a few years.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I lost touch with him a few years later, but the incident&#39;s been on my mind a lot in recent months.  The memories are still vivid and wonderful...but  I&#39;d really like 2 questions answered...(1) why haven&#39;t I ever heard of an even remotely similar experience, and (2) how on earth could I have dismissed it so matter of factly as I was (and am) an avid UFO fan?   The craft shape was unlike any photos and drawings I&#39;ve seen (the uninterrupted arc, no dome or anything) and the total lack of anything dramatic happening.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Didn&#39;t land, but was less than 3 feet above ground until it departed.  The immensity of the thing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Apparently it was unaware of my presence but left when the approaching headlights were approaching.<n> <n><n> <n><n> PLEASE NOTE:  This was nearly 50 years ago, so the dating shown may be very inaccurate.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report provides no telephone number.  We have written to him, requesting that he have the other witness also submit a report.  PD))<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))<n>

No structure apparent.<n> <n><n> <n><n> During a clear noon with no clouds and dense blue sky, I looked straight up (12 o’clock) and observed something slowly moving across the sky at apparently extreme altitude.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I stared at it for a good 15 min with my school mates.<n> <n><n> <n><n> No structure could be seen. No lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> No color, just an extremely bright solid white dot crossing the sky with a brightness rivaling the sun, but NO glare.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This white dot appeared to be not much smaller than a dime at arms length.<n> <n><n> <n><n> To me it looked just like “a White Hole in the blue sky.”  My best description!<n> <n><n> <n><n> Incidently, there was also a Nike missle base not far from this location.<n>
9/14/58 19:30|Ashland|KY|Circle|45 seconds|Near observations of a slow moving silent object and ground effects.|2/14/08|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/061/S61348.html|4|ndxe195809| Near observations of a slow moving silent object and ground effects.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A sudden high wind outside attracted my attention. Thinking it was a storm that had blown in I looked outside as tornados were known to strike the Ohio valley. The time was twilight and early fall in the year 1958. The leaves were still on the trees. I looked out the back window which afforded a view from 90 degrees up to 30 degrees to the next hill which was 600 feet away. The trees were being blown downward. Our house was located just over a hill on Ray street in Ashland, Kentucky. A sustained downdraft was something that I had never seen. Prior to this event the air had been still. It wasn&#39;t cold enough for a fire. Looking up I saw the leading edge of a near object. By near I mean that there was no way to determine just how high except that it was close to the ground. As a minimum it had to be higher than the average terrain. Three hundred feet might be a good estimate. The direction of motion was north to south. The leading edge was a wide curve, the left edge did not block the horizon. It was only lit from above since it was twilight so the details on the underside could not be seen. Being a child at the time I yelled for my mother. She saw the receding edge of the object. It simply passed over at a constant speed. The axis of motion was east by at least 500 feet. The trailing edge going out of sight It had a thickness but that was seen only for an instant as the viewing angle decreased. Wind was not blowing in my face as I did not have to squint nor was wind blowing into the window. So how could you have a noise of wind without me being in the blast? On the passage of the object all wind effects ceased. Here is what was missing, no turbine whine, no motor noise, no fuel smell, no nothing. Silent and dark except for the trees being lashed downward. However the force downward was not sufficient to break off the limbs which sets the maximum force to less than that necessary to break off mature poplar tree limbs. That was about the weakest trees there other than apple perhaps. So from ! the heig ht and transit information and a good guess that it was 300 yards across you should be able to decide on a weight of the object since it was balanced by a constant downward force. I didn&#39;t notice any change in the downward force from edge to edge. Normal force from propulsion is concentrated at the center falling off to the edges. Or it is high at the edge and still in the center riding on a bubble o higher air pressure.I feel like someone who has seen something but can only say canoe in the sky. Not enough information. An object like that was part of the air force experiments at that time and Wright Patterson AFB is nearby. However circular aircraft were not that big. It is not possible to move that much air and not have some kind of audible infrasound. That was fifty years ago. My mothers story changed with time. My brother and his friends said they saw three moving back and forth over the Ohio river moving east. I really didn&#39;t believe him at the time. He didn&#39;t mention his experience until we told the beginning of ours. My memory is accurate from that time. What has faded a little are the visual memories. Conclusions? You can&#39;t say what it was. Only that it was. You can&#39;t extrapolate the origin. Consider a bright flash in the sky that rivals the sun. What could it be? An exploding meteor, a collapsing magnetic star, an unknown massive high energy particle, a tiny black hole, something we might not understand for hundreds of years, a blood vessel pressing on nerves in the eye. It is not always an explanation that fits our experience. What did we see in 1958? An object that changed position with time. An object that was opaque and had mass. An object that balanced its mass with a uniform downward force. The downward force ended rapidly with the passage of the object and that the ending of the downward force was not abrupt. The object was close enough that the entire object was never seen in its entirity. The front edge had passed from view before the back passed from view. I wish there was more. It is only by comparison with future discoveries that might give meaning to the event.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.  PD))<n>
9/7/58 19:00|Arthur|ND|Unknown|5-15 min.|Two lights of alternating color traveling and stopping at unexplainable rates of speed.|10/31/03|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/032/S32442.html|5|ndxe195809| Two lights of alternating color traveling and stopping at unexplainable rates of speed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> First noticed 1 light to the west of our farm house,it was motionless and it was changing several differnt colors. It was dark and the land is very flat our veiw was in no way obstructed, but we could make out no shape or source for the light. It appeared to be 1/2 - 3/4 mile to our west 50-100 ft above the ground. Suddenly from our South-East a bright white light crossed a great expanse of the sky in an arcing path at an unbeleivable rate of speed and came to a stop next to the light we had first observed.They remained this way motionless,altrenating colors for several minutes.Then just as quickly as it appeared the second light left in the same path it had taken to join the first light.The first light then left in a path that took it due west and arcing up at a high rate of travel.Even though this happened some 45 years ago, and I was only 5 years old, I rember it like it was yesterday. I don`t remember it because of the sighting, I will always rember it because of what happened to a five year old boy later that very night and again the following winter of the same year! After 45 years of trying to explain what happened to me later that night and again about two months later,( to myself)I beleive I may have had two encounters with the source of those lights. There are only two logical explinations for what I experienced. Either the sighting caused nightmares, or I was abducted by them twice for approximately 2 hours each time. I sincerely think I was abducted because of several things that point to me not being asleep, before , during,or after the encounters.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>
9/1/58 21:00|Perry|IA|Triangle|15-20 seconds|Triangular formation of red objects flying soundlessly across the sky.|6/24/14|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/110/S110526.html|6|ndxe195809| Triangular formation of red objects flying soundlessly across the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My sister (11) and I (14) walked out into our back driveway well after sunset.  It was fully dark and there were few or no clouds in the sky.  We were on a childish mission at the time. We were just out of the door when my sister said, “George…look!”, while pointing upward. There, north of where we stood, against a dark sky filled with stars, was a formation of red (fiery but dull red) objects (12-15) arrayed in a filled in equilateral triangle traveling across the sky.  I was transfixed and rapid-fire questions were zipping through my mind.  Geese?  Aircraft?  Sun reflection?  What is altitude?  Speed?  Why are they making no noise?  They traveled north to south in roughly 15-20 seconds.  I noticed slight changes in position between objects as they flew.  That observation told me that they were individual objects.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Both my sister and I were very savvy science oriented kids.  These objects simply didn’t meet any criteria that related to “normal.”  Can you imagine standing there dumbfounded while examining every possible source in your arsenal of “normal”.  No noise, not cloud reflection, simply doesn’t fit within experiential normal.  I had seen B52’s flying at altitude.  They appeared to move slowly across the sky.  I had the impression that these objects were at a high altitude and traveling very fast. In retrospect, I think the “red” color was frictional heating.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We ran in the house hysterical telling our mother that we had just seen UFOs.  She eventually believed us and called the local newspaper the next day.  An article appeared in the Perry (Iowa) Daily Chief concerning our sighting.  I suffered endless harassment at school because I didn’t know how to recognize…Geese, B52’s, fighter aircraft, balloons…blah, blah, blah.  The same crap every UFO experience receives.<n> <n><n> <n><n> That experience is indelibly etched upon my mind.  That is the moment at which I knew beyond any doubt that UFOs did exist. Extra terrestrial?  Who knows?.  My sister and I witnessed a technology that just didn’t exist in that day and age in the known human realm.  Further, it was apparent that each object in the formation was guided by an intelligence.<n>

I saw a saucer shaped craft ahead of me. It was visible because of a light going around like a light house. It was low on the horizon. I observed it all the way home and got out and looked at it for several minutes to get a good look. I went in for a binocular but it was gone when I came out. Later a newspaper reported it saying that seven people had reported it to the &#34;authorities.&#34; The direction of the craft was due east from Fargo.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date of event is approximate; witness elects to remain totally anonymous, and provides no contact information.
