The man in the truck had one arm and this head outside the truck window and was looking up at the saucer. My younger brother got up at this time and looked out the window beside the one I was looking out, and also saw the saucer. The saucer stayed in place for about 30 sec. to a minute, then took off across the Allegheny river and over a Quaker State tank/drum on top of the hill, within a second. We tried to wake our mother up, but see told us to go back to sleep. The next morning we asked other kids on the block if they saw anything, no one did. The saucer looked about 30 feet long and about 15-20 feet high. It appeared to be made of a silver metal, with a dark gray circle around it. Appeared to be a large window (very dark) just above the ring around the saucer. Their were lights on the top and bottom of the saucer that were yellowish/white and they pulsated (may have been causing humming sound). I was 11 years old at the time, and my brother was 9. This vision has always been very clear, and I have never seen another since.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

It was first seen at about 2500 Yards distant and only about 600 feet in height but continued to get closer, as the distance decreased I quickly realized this was not any aircraft of our technology.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was a crystal clear morning with no clouds and the sun was low in the east as it hit this object it looked like polished aluminum or stainless steel, it was not real large my best guess as to its size would be about 45-55 feet round but slightly cone shaped it had lights around bottom edge and they were rotating what looked to be in the opposite direction of the crafts rotation.   It came to within 120 yards of our home and then just stopped and hovered over the roof of our next door neighbors home and stayed in that spot for about 7 minutes and that’s when  I called my mom and sister to also watch this object and we all observed it until it decided to leave.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It went straight vertical and went out of sight with no sound of any kind. I look back on this event and to this day can’t understand why not one of us had taken any photos of this thing, we all had cameras but neither my sister, mother nor I thought to grab one and get pictures.  As close as this craft was it should have photographed extremely well.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I often think back and wonder if this thing had us hypnotized in some fashion.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.

4/15/75 02:00|Tifton|GA|Sphere|15 Seconds|Spring of 1975, 20 miles North of Tifton, Ga. at 2AM while driving South on I-75|10/11/05|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/046/S46902.html|6|ndxe197504| Spring of 1975, 20 miles North of Tifton, Ga. at 2AM while driving South on I-75<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was living in Tennessee in early 1975 and had decided to move to the Ft Lauderdale area.  My wife and I were traveling South on Interstate 75 in the Spring of 1975, we were making a trip to the Ft. Lauderdale area to check things out.  I liked driving at night because there was a lot less traffic and much nicer traveling.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I remember very clearly that night I saw the UFO, there was no mistaking what it was.  It was approximately 2AM in the morning and my wife had fallen asleep while I was driving South.   I remember it was a very beautiful night that night and there was not a cloud in the sky.   I even remember sticking my head out the driver side window to look at the constellations a few times.  It was South Ga. and there were no city lights and the stars were magnificant that night, like I said, not a clould in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then, all of a sudden, the entire Interstate highway in front of me was completely lit up as though it was daytime.  The road is very flat in that part of S. Ga, so I could see cars for several miles in front of me on both sides of the road.   I was amazed that the whole Interstate was suddenly lit up in a manner very similar to the light when a large lighting bolt lights up everything.  But there were no clouds or lightening bolts that night, only perfect weather.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As the light stayed lit, I began searching the sky and my view from left to right trying to figure out where all the light was coming from... Then I saw it perfectly through the rear passenger window, as it was just hovering in the sky.  It was enormous!   At first it looked like a full moon because it was a perfect sphere, but it was 10 times the size of a full moon.  It was only a couple hundred yards from the Interstate, and it was very low to the ground.  I couldn&#39;t believe my eyes!  I knew exactly what it was the second I saw it because I knew we don&#39;t have any technology that is perfectly a sphere, can hover like that, and 10 times the size of a full moon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> And, the colors were amazing.  The whole sphere was a solid bright green color, and all around the perimeter the light colors appeared to be a red and organge flashing of colors.  My guess was that the perimeter colors of the sphere was reflecting the propulsion system as they went completely around the sphere.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So here I am, still driving but totally focused on looking at the amazing, huge, bright colored sphere.  Then, as I was looking at it through my passenger rear glass, it went from standing still in the sky to shooting 180 degrees across my front windshield.  It went from standing still, to completely across my horizon in less than 2 seconds.  I had no doubt whatsoever what it was knowing that we have never had technology that can move that fast.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then, I noticed that I was just approaching an Interstate exit, I was in the area of 20 miles north of Tifton Ga.  The exit had one of those very tall gas signs which use to be so popular.  As I was approaching the exit, my wife suddendly woke up in an absolute panic.  She started screaming, stop the car, stop the car, the car is on fire!<n> <n><n> <n><n> I immediately said to her to look at the tall gas sign, as I wanted her to see that the sign was complete enveloped in a type of smoke from the UFO.  She saw it, but it took me a minute to convince her that the car was not on fire.  But what really happended was that she was smelling the smoke left behind by the UFO as it tore across the sky at light speed and the reason I asked her to look at the tall gas sign, was because she was sleeping when I saw the UFO and I wanted whatever proof she could still see, I filled her in on the details later.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Oh yea, one more thing that always amazed me, the smoke actually smelded like honeysickels.... Really!  It did not smell like smoke at all, it was absoultely the sweet smell of honeysickles.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This UFO what I now believe to be &#34;a mother ship&#34;, but that would take more explanation.  Maybe another time, as this is the first time I have ever told this story except occasionally to friends.<n>

I had traveled with a friend to Georgia to pick up her children.  Her ex-husband decided to come back with us, so we ended up with two vehicles. My friend and her ex were in the car ahead and I had the children with me.  I remember quite a cars on the highway with us.  I can&#39;t remember how, when, or why, but the next thing I remember is standing outside the car looking into the sky.  Everyone was standing outside their cars looking up.  There was a huge ship in the sky with lights on the underside. It would pulse red then bright white.  Four smaller ships emerged out of the larger.  The four smaller ships put on a performance I&#39;ll never forget.  They would fly at ubelivable speeds towards each other and just when you knew they were going to crash they would veer off into different directions, or just stop as they came together seemly as one and hoover then shoot off in different directions.  It is hard to describe in words the flying feats they performed.  It was as if they were performing for us.  I&#39;m not sure how long this went on but the next thing I remember is the larger ship hoovering just above the trees and people from the highway entering. The next memory is driving home (Orange, Texas) and one of the smaller ships following all the way.  From that time forward I have experienced many encounters, usually a small ship, sometimes white light, but usually red.  The details of these encounters I prefer not to discuss online.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((FOLLOW-UP COMMUNICATION FROM WITNESS))<n> <n><n> <n><n> Dear Mr. Davenport,<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;m not sure of the exact date, but it was between March and June of 1975.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Sincerely,<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((name deleted))<n>

One was a math major, one a criminology major, I was a special education major (now an RN), and I don&#39;t remember what the other was majoring in. We were all women in our early 20&#39;s.  We were far from any population centers, no lights from towns or rest stops, when we spotted an orange globe, or sphere hovering motionless in the sky. At first, I thought it was a Union 76 ball, but immediately realized that there was no gas station around, and the thing was so huge, that I knew it wasn&#39;t a logo. It was orange, but then changed to red, then dark red, back to orange, to yellow, to pale yellow, then to white, and back to yellow, orange, red, and so forth. We started to pull over to get a better look at it, and it took off straight up. It moved so fast that it couldn&#39;t be followed with the eye. It seemed to leave a trail as it passed through some part of the sky, maybe as it went through some thin clouds. I&#39;m not sure about why it left a short trail at one point, only that it did. It paused, was stationary for a few moments, then disappeared. It didn&#39;t &#34;fly away&#34;, it was just there one second and gone the next. The whole episode lasted maybe 5 minutes at the most. I had never seen anything like that before, and haven&#39;t seen anything like it since. Even after 30 years or so, the thing is burned into my memory. Are there any other reports like this one? Oh, and it was completely silent, as far as we could tell.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

It caught my attention because it was a very bright object and it did not appear to be a plane.  Suddenly it stopped moving and sat still in the sky for two or three seconds.  It then moved straight up and stopped again beneath a cloud formation.  Next a light from the object projected up onto the cloud for a second and then was turned off.  The object then shot up thru the cloud and I lost sight of the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFOR Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

I noticed a round light over the Millstone Nuclear Power Plant.  I was watching it while we drove.  I noticed that it appeared to be jumping around in the sky.  I asked my then boyfriend to stop the car and look at it too.  We parked the car and watched this round light jump all over the sky in a random pattern.  It would then hover and move again.  We watched this for awhile and then though it would be fun to watch it from the swings at the beach.  We drove to the beach watching it, parked the car and watched it.  Sat on the swings not moving and watched it.  At one point we got scared because it moved move over the area we were sitting at and hovered.  It was still far enough up in the sky to be round but it was larger at this point.  Then while we were watching it got very bright and zoomed over the ocean at a great speed.  The light left a! tail that went away as fast at the light it self did. In a second it was gone.  We both remember this day exactly how it happened.  It was the one and only time we every saw anything like this.

The popular TV show MASH was on in our living room which faced Colorado Blvd, the street where we lived. My mother and two brothers were in the living room watching MASH, and I was in the family room watching another TV show. I could see and hear through our kitchen into our living room, where the rest of my family was watching television. I began to hear some excitement coming from the living room and went in to see what was going on. My whole family was staring out the window when suddenly my brother (17) darted to his room to get a camera and out the front door he went. I took his place at the window and was amazed at what I saw. Above the houses across the street and hovering, was a cigar-shaped disc, about 100-200 feet long, bright, with what I can remember as alternating white and red lights. Things began to happen very fast and the excitement was none like I’ve experienced before. We all were outside within seconds of me entering the living room to see what was going on. Once outside, my brother (17) easily scaled onto our roof via our front porch. My other brother (12) ran out into the front yard. I can remember my mother being very concerned, she kept me by her side as we continued to watch from our front porch. My brother’s camera was a cheap Kodak with a flash, but in the dark, he was unlucky at getting any kind of exposure. Anyway, we watched the craft through the tall trees, hover back and forth, over the houses, for about two minutes. The trees were not in bloom as of yet (my estimated date of 4/1 very easily could have been late February or March) and I could see the object through the trees. Another aspect that I am certain of is that I could see through the craft, I mean, it was a clear starry night, facing Mt. Rose and Slide Mountain, part of the Sierra Nevada Mountains which are easily visible on a clear ! day. At night, however, all one could see were the stars, and I can remember seeing the stars through the outline of the craft, which was bright orange-yellow. The lights I mentioned earlier went from one end to the other, through the center of the cigar shape. The strangest thing about our sighting is that is seemed very dark and quiet on our street for that time of night. Not one of our neighbors, who we all knew very well, were outside at that time, and not a single vehicle drove by. The episode, as I said, lasted about two minutes. The last thing I remember is that it all of the sudden disappeared, either from speeding away, or vanishing into thin air, I can’t say which. I am confident the year was 1975 for a number of reasons which I won’t get into here for this could get very long. I will say that this sighting has never left my consciousness. I rarely tell anyone and very rarely discuss it with my family. I can also say that the experience immediately (within one year) turned me and my mother into UFO buffs, of a sort. I can remember reading my first UFO book (Project Blue Book) I checked out at my school library (Vaughn Middle School). Ever since we’ve shared information and still do to this day, but we rarely venture into a conversation about that night. The experience has changed my life, and at the ripe age of almost forty-three, my interest has peaked so much that I have finally taken the time to write it down. That night we called the radio station and they thought we were joking. I told my friends at school and they didn’t believe my either. I do remember my mother telling us one of here friends from the hospital where she worked, spotted the craft. This person, according to my mom lived across Plumb Lane, so it made sense that she could have seen the same thing we did.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

As the objects came over head we could see the stars between the objects. There were several student employees in engineering school at Red River Army depot who witnessed this. They swore they would never repeat the sighting for fear of losing their jobs.  I you were to draw a line right down Hwy 8 south to north that was approximately the flight direction.
