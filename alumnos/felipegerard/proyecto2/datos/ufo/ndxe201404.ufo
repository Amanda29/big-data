Completely silent|5/2/14|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/109/S109061.html|1|ndxe201404| Pinkish verticle beam of light. 2 bright pulsating orbs and then a triangular shaped object with a hollow centre. Completely silent<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were sitting outside as the weather was so warm and pleasant.  We have a habit of looking at the stars and trying to pick out planets.  We noticed a pinkish reddish beam of light to the north east.  It  didn&#39;t move and sometimes stretched a bit higher.  I was looking to its right and  saw an object white in color get very very bright staying in one spot and then disappearing.  Somewhat how a lighthouse light would fade in and out.  We don&#39;t live near any ocean whatsoever.  He however did not see that.  A few minutes of watching it some more he looked in the sky and saw the exact thing I had seen but to the left of the vertical beam.  We really didn&#39;t think much of the whole thing thinking it might have been satellites.  All of a sudden I looked over my shoulder to the right was this massive triangularly shaped object.  It made no sound and had a tremendous speed.  It appeared red when I caught his attention and faded to a dark with white lines.  The triangle  had a ! hollow centre and perfectly symmetrical.  It roughly disappeared into where the shaft of light was.  A few minutes later the shaft of light disappeared as we&#39;ll.<n>

They were in a zigzag pattern all equally distant from each other.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The one at the bottom of the formation was much larger with a flashing red light in the center and flashing white lights on each side.  The smaller ones had red flashing lights only.  At first they were flashing in a pattern to each other then the large one began to move to a higher altitude and toward the Northwest.  The smaller lights lined up and seemed to escort the larger one.<n> <n><n> <n><n> One sped up to the front, one went to the side with the last two tightly following.  They moved very fast, staying in the same formation until they were out of our sight.<n>

Hovering over a lake until I took a flash photo, then headed towards and over us.|5/2/14|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/109/S109056.html|8|ndxe201404| Triangular object with 2 wings/ 3 lights.  Hovering over a lake until I took a flash photo, then headed towards and over us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were driving down Bullheadly road at about 9 pm when I saw two bright lights, brighter and different from any airplane lights I&#39;ve seen.  I told the driver of the car to keep going and not turn so we can see what it was.  As we got closer and closer (we are on a road heading right for a lake called Lake Iamonia) we noticed that it was not moving, seemingly hovering. We went right to the lake from and parked with our lights on.  It was hovering at the center of the lake.  I am not sure how big it exactly was, but it wasn&#39;t small, and it was hovering about 200 feet up.  It had two main bright lights on its wings and a smaller white light on the front. We watched it for about 5 minutes, just sitting there hovering.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I decided to take a picture of it to show people, but i forgot to turn off the flash.  Right after I flashed the camera (the photo is not that good) it started coming toward us.  We were still interested, so we rolled down the window to get a look.  The sound was a quiet drone, almost like an airplane that is very, very high up in the sky (just a reminder again, it wasn&#39;t high in the sky at all).  It wasn&#39;t going fast to start out with, but when it went over us and we turned around to follow it, it spend up gradually to a speed we could not even match with our car.  We also noticed as it was over us that there definitely was two wings, on the side of it there was small red lights, and it was a sharp triangle.  That was the last we saw of it, going out into the distance.<n>

The camera was facing West.  I live on the East Coast of Florida.  We were on the third story of our apartment when we seen the strange objects.  The objects were moving around each other as if they were &#34;dancing&#34;.  The objects began to lower down until they were out of sight below the apartment roofs and tree tops.  One of the objects was changing color from blue to green.  The other object kept a steady red color. They made no sound.  They looked like a glowing circle of light.  About 5 times the size of a star that you would normally see.  We could tell they were not far from the ground, maybe 40 or 45 feet high.<n>

Traveling slowly from east to west is my guess. Heading more northwest than west.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I watched it completely dematerialize over the course of about 3-4 seconds.  The sky was completely clear due to high winds.  No smoke from the Rancho Cucamonga fire was in the area.  You could see the smoke in the distance, but no smoke or clouds were anywhere around the craft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I saw this ship twice about an hour apart.

I told him to turn the porch light off as he came outside onto the deck.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then we watched 4 lights, hovering around in the clouds, then they grouped together, then one each flew in each direction, being north, east, west, and south.  They constantly done this and would even fly in random patterns at times.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I came back inside, and went back on the deck approximately 30 minutes later, and they were still doing as before.<n>

Not sure it IS  a sports complex out there, but the lights on the ground are similar to one.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As we drove south on I-10 and got more directly east of that complex we saw the lights start to move further apart and head in a south direction.  At first there were 2 lights, but as they moved south 2  more appeared and trailed behind those.  They were somewhat larger lights than you would see on a plane moving across the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The height seemed to be about double or triple the height of the sports complex lighting. As they moved south the first 2 lights rose higher with the last 2 remaining closer to the ground. It appeared to be a line of 4 lights at varying heights.  One of the lower lights dimmed out along the way.  We drove along watching those till they were obscured by the hills approaching the rest area by Casa Grande.  The ride from where those sports complex lights are to the rest area is approx 20 – 25 min.  We observed them the whole way down.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A couple times the lights would dim somewhat and then disappear completely. There was always at least one visible.   2 lights reappeared as we passed the hills (don’t know if they went out or which ones they were) and we followed those 2 lights- which dimmed again, one went out, one came back on, for a period of another 10 min., or so, as we drove west, up to Kortsen Rd, 8 miles west into Casa Grande.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We could  no longer tell if they were the same lights or 2 new ones as they would dim out, and then re-emerge further down the road.  All the time being the exact same yellow light and same size as previously observed. We then headed back north on Kortsen Rd. for about 2 or 3 miles to the big plant that’s out there.  We are now about 30-35 miles south of Chandler.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We sat and watched the 2 lights till they faded out, about 20 minutes.  At this point they no longer seemed to be moving, just sitting pretty high in the sky, well above where we had first seen them hovering over those sports complex lights, pretty low in the sky.  Before fading out we saw what appeared to be a smaller craft, which looked more like a plane with the regular small white and red lights circling these 2 yellow lights.  As it circled, it headed west, then south, and as it came around heading east again and appearing to be almost in line with these 2 yellow lights, the yellow lights went out.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The lights that seemed to be a small plane craft stayed out there moving slowly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We left after a few minutes and kept looking back to see if they reappeared but they did not.<n>

A plane, flys above this thing, which by the way hovers near the ground, so it&#39;s not a plane.  But as the plane flys over it, this thing moves suddenly.  So, wasn&#39;t sure if it was a helicopter, then again.<n>

It appeared to slow for a shooting star, and too fast for a plane.  I saw it for what was maybe 3 seconds moving at a steady speed north, then charge direction or stop.  Then I lost it while I was driving, and could not see it again.  The light to me appeared really far away, and dim, also odd as it was raining with overcast.<n>

It was definitely not any plane or helicopter I&#39;ve ever heard it sounded like a plane descending kind of humming whistle but it was constant and almost sounded as if it had a melody to it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Doing what any one would do if they heard something strange like that I walked outside to investigate I couldn&#39;t see anything but I could still hear the sound it sounded as if it was coming from everywhere at once.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I tried recording the sound but when I played it back you couldn&#39;t hear the sound (the recording device has bad audio).<n> <n><n> <n><n> Around ten minutes after trying to record it with no luck I went inside to get online and see if anyone else had heard the sound and my internet froze just completely stopped working. It wouldn&#39;t come back on until the next day I usually don&#39;t have internet problems so that happening is very uncommon.  At around 10:25-10:30 pm, I heard at least 4 helicopters flying over the area they hovered over the area for at least 15 minutes before dispatching.  I walked into my living room and  asked my sister if she had heard the sound she told me she muted the TV because she thought she heard a really weird melody coming from outside but didn&#39;t think much of it... she is not as in to the  UFO scene as I am.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Although I didn&#39;t see anything that would say UFO, I definitely heard something very strange and simultaneously lost connection to the internet which is in my mind definitely proof of something.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;ve had a couple experiences with UFO&#39;s in my life, but none as strange as this this sound was not from any mainstream aircraft.  It could of been a HAARP test but I don&#39;t know I am mainly posting this to see if anyone else has heard something similar.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

Is it possible that you may be able to shed some light (no pun intended) on this subject matter?  I think it could possibly be Military Drone training, due to the fact that we see fighter jets going towards the general direction of the lights; only to return after they are out.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.

I see unexplained activity in the same part of the sky often I started noticing these lights years ago &amp; I&#39;m not sure what is going on.  But there seems to be more activity lately. Kinda thinking there&#39;s some kind of colony in the woods some where close.  They fly too low to be unheard at the speeds they fly at major chance to see them is middle of the night look towards Sanders &amp; Wolf lodge wait to find a what would be a constellation moving maybe you will catch the dancing lights as we&#39;ll!<n>

4/27/14 23:00|Oakley|MI|Unknown|2-3 minutes|Two lights.|5/2/14|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/109/S109007.html|45|ndxe201404| I went outside because I seen two bright lights very low (just above the tree line).  I thought it was a low flying passenger jet getting ready to land or crash. It was moving very slow.  I was afraid that it was going to crash into the house.  The two lights were spread apart about the width of a passenger jet wing span.  There were no other visible lights on the aircraft.  When it was directly above me it sounded like a jet but it was very quiet (especially since it was so low).  My wife was in the bedroom and heard nothing.  I was on the phone explaining what I saw and to my niece and she said that she heard it.  When it was directly above me I looked up at the bottom.  It appeared to be whitish color with no markings. It was much wider than a underbelly of a plane.  My original thought was that it was some sort of military transport flying low to avoid radar.  Then I realized that there were no other light on it.  The two lights looked to be giant spot lights and they seemed to move as if it were searching for something.  I cannot explain what it was.  Once it went over the house I ran to the other side of the house to look out a window and it was nowhere to be seen.  I then rushed outside to look but it was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Addendum:  The size of the aircraft approximately 20 moons across from light to light.  The size of the bottom appeared to be about three of my fist on my out stretched arm. It was moving south to north and made a slight oblique move to the west.  The sighting was just east of Oakley. The craft flew over the Shiawassee river towards me.  The time was between 22:10 hrs and 23:00 hrs.<n>

The first pair we saw sort of chased each other and wiggled a lot, enough to make me think it might have been some space junk falling.  But it went fast and straight into the distance.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then there was a v formation of five or six going in the same direction on the same path about five minutes later.  Then a lone one.  Then another pair  went by side by side.<n> <n><n> <n><n> And then ten or twenty minutes later they flew back from the direction they had gone in a bigger v formation, they were not going the same way they had come more of 90 degree angle from some farther away point.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were star gazing on a roof when we spotted these.  They were silent and moved about as fast as I&#39;ve seen fighter jets go (Wich theses may have been?)  They were silent though. No physics defying movements.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The formations were not perfect.  It was really clear out.  The lights seemed like they may have been heading for the bellingham airport, but they were very low and we saw no planes or plane lights or shapes connected to the moving lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The lights did not leave trails.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke via telephone with the witness, and she corrected the time of the sighting.  She reports that it occurred at some time, she estimates, between 10:00 p.m. and midnight on Sunday night, April 27, 2014.  PD))<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((ADDENDUM FROM WITNESS))<n> <n><n> <n><n> Addendum to previous report:   When witnessing the event I was laying on my back with my feet towards the south west.  The lights crossed from left to right towards the north west. The final large V formation appeared from right to left many minutes later heading east.. These lights did not move directly above us as the first ones had but were towards the northern horizon and we sat up and looked behind us to watch it go.  I would compare the path of their first trajectory to the trajectory of the final V as a 45 degree angle.  The lights disappeared into the horizon before returning as he final V came into sight.  The sighting took place on railroad avenue from the roof.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((END ADDENDUM))<n>

It was fast but not like blinding fast.  flew overhead it was chevron, metallic and it looked as if I could grab it but it was above the clouds.  No sound no lights and the breeze was clam. I would say object was 40ft wide at about 400ft above me.  as I turned around to my wife it disappeared.  I have lived by airports, been in the military and I have never seen anything like this.<n>

The beam was a short spotlight, it didn&#39;t spread between the clouds, only right in front.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then the craft slowly went through the clouds, it wasn&#39;t fast at all.

At first I thought it must have been lights wrapped around trees on a hill until I realized they were moving back and forth in Z light motions.  There must have been 30-50 of them in the sky at least.  They looked like bright orange orbs and were moving in random motions and directions.  They were all close together. I sped up in my car down the road to get a closer look.  Trying to think of a logical explanation for them, I thought maybe they could be stars. I  then pulled my car over to attempt to video tape them, but when we got out of the car they all began to vanish.  They literally completely disappeared within seconds.  We managed to get the 2 or 3 of them that were left on camera, but moments later they were gone too.<n>

She asked me what it was.  When I looked I saw about 40 or 50 orange lights in the sky, which at first glance looked like lights on a mountain, almost like a ski slope all lit up.  But I knew there was no mountain there, it was the sky. When I looked at these strange lights at first they seemed to mimic the star pattern, I thought I saw the big dipper but then I looked at the actual big dipper and realized these were not stars at all.  The objects were bright orange and moving into formations and making maneuvers that no earth like aircraft is capable of making.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We pulled the car over and got out to get a better look without crashing the car.  That’s when I noticed these objects start to disappear.  It’s like they almost just vanished into thin air.  By the time I got out of the car and got my camera on my cell phone out all were gone except for 2 or 3 of these objects.  I managed to ca! tch them on the video but you barely make out what I was looking at.  We were both so freaked out about what we just saw that you can hear the panic in our voices on the video.  Trust me this video does not do what we saw justice, and I wish I could of clearly captured what we seen in full.  I literally thought it was an invasion because of how many of them there were.<n>

Witnessed by 5.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What I saw was orange orbs.  2 over about 20 min.  First one  below clouds that were about 2000 ft. It slowly came from the west.  First thought it was plane landing lights except it was orange.  No red,green or flashing beacons.  Just a slight pulsating to the orange light. Then it stoped and didn&#39;t move for several minutes.  That&#39;s when I got the binoculars out to try and see detail.  Only could see  orange slightly pulsating light.  Then it starting moving again only directly south.  Slow steady movement slightly pulsating then slowly fading out. I thought I could see only a red dot after it faded.  About 10 min. later here comes another one.  This came from the south heading north.  Only very bright and low.  Same pulsating orange orb type light.  It moved slow then faded.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What I saw was dull compared to what 5 neighbors saw.  They called me about 10 min. before my sighting to tell they saw groups of 3 to 5 orange orbs together slowly coming from the west then they turned south and went into the clouds.  They were speechless and confused at what they saw.  I said sure till I saw them myself.<n> <n><n> <n><n> No clue to what it was.  Only thing slightly different that day was thunder storms had built up during the day.  What I saw was definitely a unidentified aerial phenomenon!<n>

I live in Kenmore which is at the NE corner of the lake.  The first six were in very loose formation, three above and three below each other.  They started out to be a red orange - orange color and proceeded to move to the east - south east direction.  The further they moved, the whiter they became with less orangish color.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After about a minute, several more appeared from the same point where  we observed the others came from.  Over a span of about 5 to 10 minutes, we saw at least 20 of them.  Three or four of them were very close to each other and almost touched at times but most were separated by at least two to five or 10 degrees.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Their size was all the same, about 4 times brighter than the brightest star.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A few made irregular moves but most just drifted along over about a 3 minute period until they disappeared into a low hanging cloud to the south and east.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The last one we observed was around 9:15 pm, alone and at a much higher degree above the horizon, apprx 70 degrees from the South West, close to being over head.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It also began extremely bright orange- red and turned white,  disappearing after 2 or 3 minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  The sighting event occurred on Sunday night, April 27, 2014.

The light was too bright to belong to a plane, and was pulsing, rather than blinking, never going completely out.  It appeared to be very large, or somewhat close.  At first it moved slowly, heading north, then it almost seemed to shoot forward, or skip, for a moment before slowing down again.  My husband used his cell phone to shoot video of it until we lost view of it over the house.  I ran through the house and out the front door to see if I could follow it or find it again, but it was nowhere to be seen.<n>

It moved across the clear sky for ~10 seconds then vanished.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Only a few seconds later a second star appeared it too being white, circular, and had no other lights.

It was white, circular, and about the size of a star as were the previous three.  It too appeared from overhead just like the previous three, but moved west to east.  This UFO moved across the sky till I could not see it anymore.  It did not vanish.  There were no aircraft seen during these sightings, but I saw 2 shooting stars.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I enclosed a drawing to help explain my sights.<n>

What hit me at first was how bright it was.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then it changed color from yellow/orange to bright red, then back to yellow/orange.  It would take the light about 5 seconds to gradually change from one color to the other.  Then holding that color for 3 seconds before gradually turning back.  The brightness would kind of pulse on right before it went solid color.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It looked to be a single light source that changed colors.  Not two different lights that faded in and out and definitely not a spinning light. When it was solid red it was a very bright red, almost cherry like or fire engine red.  The light quality reminded me of super bright LEDs.  The light had a sort of uniform glow to it in all directions.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There were no other accompanying or secondary lights on what ever it was. I tried to listen for engine noise but I could hear nothing over traffic down the street.  I would have got my phone but I figured by the time I ran in and got it, it would be out of view.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I kept waiting for it to do something UFO like. Like change direction or take off suddenly but it kept flying in a straight line.  It was pretty high up, about where you&#39;d expect to see air traffic.  But all you could see was this ball of pulsating light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It could have very well been a plane.  But I&#39;ve never seen lights like that on anything. When it past, it still had the same uniform glow as if the light was being emitted in all directions.<n> <n><n> <n><n> If it was a plane, I&#39;d have to say it&#39;s something new.<n>

A friend of my 12 year old came to the door and asked that we go outside so she would know she was not crazy.  We then observed what she had been witnessing for the previous 10 minutes or so.  From the horizon north of us heading south/southwest a bright light red/orange/white (changing) would move silently across the sky directly above us and then somewhere between 90-120 degrees across would blink out and disappear.  As one was overhead, the next would come from the horizon.  The 13 year old girl did say that she witnessed two come at once with one blinking out before the other.  The rest of us saw one at a time.  There were 20 of us in the yard the witnessed the last 4.  I was able to video record with my Droid Razor Maxx three of them.  Links to the YouTube posting are provided.  Keep in mind that in the recordings I opted to stay zoomed in at all times other than! the beginning of one that shows one initially coming over the horizon starting spot over our house before I zoomed. Because I was zoomed in you it shakes (remember the flight path was direct and smooth) and you cannot see how quickly they came one at a time across the sky. I hoped by staying zoomed in there might be a moment something of importance might be caught.  My phone was zoomed in at 4x. Just as the last one was gone, I called 911 to report.  They had no knowledge of the event and did not call me back.  I called Wright Patterson Airforce Base, roughly 60 miles north, and they said they had no activity or drills going on that night.  Below is a weather report confirming what I perceived.  We had gentle winds from the west, not the northeast, and clear skys.  I am a professional in the finance industry.  The other adults that observed, along with the children ranging in ages, is a high school teacher and a sales vp for a manufacturing firm.<n> <n><n> <n><n> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TsYN9vdb0Gw&amp;feature=youtube_gdata_player  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=66j4DPRYjCU&amp;feature=youtube_gdata_player  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7s_tEJU0-c&amp;feature=youtube_gdata_player  CLIMATE REPORT NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE WILMINGTON OH 533 AM EDT SUN APR 27 2014   .................................<n> <n><n> <n><n> .THE CINCINNATI OH CLIMATE SUMMARY FOR APRIL 26 2014...<n> <n><n> <n><n> CLIMATE NORMAL PERIOD 1981 TO 2010 CLIMATE RECORD PERIOD 1869 TO 2014   WEATHER ITEM   OBSERVED TIME   RECORD YEAR NORMAL DEPARTURE LAST VALUE   (LST)  VALUE       VALUE  FROM      YEAR NORMAL ..................................................................<n> <n><n> <n><n> TEMPERATURE (F) YESTERDAY MAXIMUM         80    410 PM  89    1915  68     12       62 MINIMUM         48    508 AM  29    1919  47      1       35 AVERAGE         64                        58      6       49  PRECIPITATION (IN) YESTERDAY        0.00          1.58 1912   0.14  -0.14     0.00 MONTH TO DATE    5.04                      3.34   1.70     3.03 SINCE MAR 1      7.45                      7.30   0.15     6.94 SINCE JAN 1     12.99                     13.11  -0.12    12.54  SNOWFALL (IN) YESTERDAY        0.0                0.0    0.0      0.0 MONTH TO DATE    0.6                       0.5    0.1       T SINCE MAR 1      3.9                       3.5    0.4      8.8 SINCE JUL 1     47.5                      22.1   25.4     25.2 SNOW DEPTH       0  DEGREE DAYS HEATING YESTERDAY        1                         8     -7       16 MONTH TO DATE  262                       311    -49      301 SINCE MAR 1   1044                       977     67     1156 SINCE JUL 1   5288                      4804    484     4866  COOLING YESTERDAY        0                         1     -1        0 MONTH TO DATE    7                        14     -7       23 SINCE MAR 1      7                        14     -7       23 SINCE JAN 1      7                        14     -7       23 ................................................................<n> <n><n> <n><n> WIND (MPH) RESULTANT WIND SPEED   7   RESULTANT WIND DIRECTION   W (250) HIGHEST WIND SPEED    24   HIGHEST WIND DIRECTION    NW (300) HIGHEST GUST SPEED    31   HIGHEST GUST DIRECTION    NW (300) AVERAGE WIND SPEED    10.0   SKY COVER POSSIBLE SUNSHINE  MM AVERAGE SKY COVER 0.4   WEATHER CONDITIONS THE FOLLOWING WEATHER WAS RECORDED YESTERDAY.<n> <n><n> <n><n> NO SIGNIFICANT WEATHER WAS OBSERVED.<n> <n><n> <n><n> RELATIVE HUMIDITY (PERCENT) HIGHEST    71           500 AM LOWEST     25           400 PM AVERAGE    48  ........................................................<n> <n><n> <n><n> THE CINCINNATI OH CLIMATE NORMALS FOR TODAY NORMAL    RECORD    YEAR MAXIMUM TEMPERATURE (F)   69        86      1990 1986 1914 MINIMUM TEMPERATURE (F)   48        30      1996   SUNRISE AND SUNSET APRIL 27 2014.........SUNRISE   646 AM EDT   SUNSET   828 PM EDT APRIL 28 2014.........SUNRISE   644 AM EDT   SUNSET   829 PM EDT   -  INDICATES NEGATIVE NUMBERS.<n> <n><n> <n><n> R  INDICATES RECORD WAS SET OR TIED.<n> <n><n> <n><n> MM INDICATES DATA IS MISSING.<n> <n><n> <n><n> T  INDICATES TRACE AMOUNT.<n> <n><n> <n><n> --------------------------------------------------------------------------------      The U.S. Naval Observatory (USNO) computes astronomical data.

Video recorded.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Last evening, April 26th, from 21:30-21:55 a group of 20 gathered at a home in Greenhills, Ohio, witnessed 14 orange/red lights move one after another across the sky each to eventually blink out.  It was very unusual making no sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> All of them came from the northeast and moved to the south/southwest (the opposite direction of our current weather pattern.  Additionally, they would have been moving too fast to be floating.  They were more the speed of a fast aircraft on a calm evening.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We had plenty of time due to the number that kept coming to record videos and take a few photos.  Additionally, we were able to observe through binoculars.  I’ve spent considerable time through my life star gazing and have never seen anything like this.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I did call 911 to report.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((ADDENDUM FROM WITNESS))<n> <n><n> <n><n> Peter,<n> <n><n> <n><n> Below is an updated version of my submission including the weather report verifying the direction of wind I reported.

When I noticed it, I thought it moved.  I then watched it continue to move using 2 stars as reference points.  It continued moving until it passed between the 2 stars and finally left my site.  Is it possible what I saw was nasa&#39;s unmanned X37 moving in orbit?  A satellite wouldn&#39;t be visible to the naked eye would it?  I&#39;ve been watching the night sky more this week because of the 2 very bright celestial bodies.  I have also witnessed 3 aircraft that I have never seen before, within an hour of each other, headed the same direction.  All 3 were flying lower than normal, made less noise than expected, and wingspans didn&#39;t seem great enough. I couldn&#39;t see any of the body of the aircraft.  Each had 3 to 4 rows of white lighted squares on the bottom, under the cockpit, which made it look flat underneath.  A single round white light on what should be the wingtips, this is how I gauged wingspan, and 2 rectangular white lights at the center of what should be the tail.  Again, I couldn&#39;t see the bodies of said aircraft with exception to the lighted squares toward the nose.  Any insight into what these sightings are or might be would be very helpful.<n>

Planes and copters frequent the area and are always  audible.  I was distracted and so did not follow until it was out of view.

The second i saw it, the white light dimmed to nothing and the red lights stayed and the entire triangle shape morphed into the shape of a plane and i started to hear a  plane engine noise.  It looked like it was flying very low to the ground, away from the city towards the north east.  After maybe 5 seconds I lost sight of it over some trees and then proceeded to notice 3 bright white orbs above me, pretty close to the ground but above the altitude of the triangle craft,  one of them stayed stationary and the other two silently moved away in opposing directions,<n> <n><n> <n><n> After another few minutes of waiting to see something more, I got back in my car and finished driving home,  upon pulling into my drive way some 20 minutes later, I saw another white orb silently flying high in their typical spuddery zig zag stop and go motions.  First triangle shaped craft I&#39;ve seen, mostly just orbs.<n>

The movements were not in any pattern or sequence, though it did move quiet often at random. Then would hover a bit &amp; dart side to side again.  Some movements were in a sporadic jerky circular motion.

Shielding my eyes I could see 3 distinct objects cruising at a speed in a &#34;V&#34; or triangle position and they seemed to be moving incredibly fast for how high they were.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They were moving from SW to the NE, and were cross shaped, leading with the long ends.  My first thought was they reminded me of the large sand bill cranes that migrate over our area this time of year, but those are usually in large flocks, you can visibly see them flapping, fly in circular motions, fly MUCH slower, and you can often hear them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Whatever these were were much higher than I would expect a  bird to be and again, cruising at quite a fast speed.  They may have been fighter jets, possibly F-16&#39;! s, but they made no sound and there was no contrail.<n>

I was vacation visiting a close friend at the time of this incident.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was taking a photo of the Chik-fil-A billboard at the intersection of Interstate Highway 10 and DeZavala Road in San Antonio and didn&#39;t realize until after I got home that I had photographed a UFO. Two UFOs, actually.  (The reason I was taking the photos was because I thought the billboard was somewhat humorous.)  I took a total of 10 photos starting at 4:56:12 pm, as I was departing the Taco Cabana drive through on Interstate Highway 10 and traveling toward DeZavala Road.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The UFO doesn&#39;t appear in any photos until 4:57:57 pm, and was gone by 4:58:05 pm.  I have a total of three and possibly four photos that show one or both UFOs.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The first photo shows two UFOs, one above the billboard and one in the bottom right quadrant, behind a tree.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The second photo shows a UFO in the upper center and &#34;cookie cutter&#34; type hole the cloud, in the same size and shape of the UFO, and a second UFO now emerged from behind a tree in the bottom right quadrant of the photo.<n> <n><n> <n><n> If you look at the photos closely, there are also some smaller, lighter grey dots that are hovering in an arc--possibly circular formation--around the UFO in the top center of the first two photos.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This was not something on my windshield or camera.  If you enlarge the photos, in one image, you can see the overhead powerline in front of the UFO and the tree in front of the second UFO.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Again, I didn&#39;t know I had photographed anything until hours later.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am willing to share additional photos, if you need them, taken before and after the photos that show the UFOs.  I am also willing to discuss the circumstances under which I took the photos and answer any questions that you might have.<n>

I was driving so I saw it first.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As we were approaching Theodore Dawes and US 90 red light I saw a formation of orange glowing lights/balls of fire hovering.  As we got closer they began to disperse and three moved off in another direction and one hovered above our vehicle about 100ft up for about 7-10 seconds as we sat at the light.  I had my head out of the drivers window looking up at it for the full 10 seconds while the light was red.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was in a circle shape but not perfect, kind of like a ball of gas that was burning but not out of control, it was like a forcefield or entity.  Looked as if you could touch the object but it may not have been completely solid.  It&#39;s hard to explain the texture of what I saw.  As the light turned green I had to drive so I started forward but I could still see this orange glowing ball of fire in my side mirror.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It moved in a very controlled manner and sort ! of glided.  It also changed direction and hovered. As I continued north on 90 I saw the object in my rear side mirror until the trees obstructed it so I&#39;m not sure if it just disappeared or flew away.  I have never seen anything in my life I cannot explain except for this.<n>

PD))|6/4/14|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/109/S109929.html|110|ndxe201404| Several yellowish/orange spheres of light rising out of the southwestern sky of Boise, ID<n> <n><n> <n><n> On Friday, April 25, 2014, at approximately 2115 MDT, I went out into my front yard to turn on our lamppost light.  As I approached the post, I noticed strange lights rising out of the southwestern sky climbing at a rapid rate and seemingly in trail of each other.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first glance, I thought I was seeing the Idaho Air National Guard A-10&#39;s getting a little night currency.  A few seconds later I realized that they were not A-10&#39;s, and thought perhaps they might be guard helicopters?  After studying the phenomenon for a few more seconds, I concluded that the lights were not consistent in appearance or in movement of any kind of aircraft that I was familiar with.  They seemed to rise out of the southwest sky in trail formation at 3 to 5 second intervals appearing as round, reddish orange, balls of light with tiny black rectangles in their centers.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The first one that got my attention was soon followed by a 2nd ,3rd, and 4th.  Their movement progressed from my right to my left rising to about 4000 AGL and estimated to be about 4 to 5 miles south of me.  As I realized more were coming, I shouted to my wife to run and see what was going on.  She immediately confirmed what I was seeing and I dashed back into the house to collect my camera.  In my excitement, fumbling with the settings, I cranked off several seconds of video and a few still photos all of poor quality before they finally disappeared.  In all, I estimate  12 to 14 objects appeared over about an 8 minute period with irregular intervals of longer duration towards the end of the sighting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The lights reached their apex to the southeast of me and as the lights faded, the black objects in their centers appeared to tumble away in the diminishing light.  I asked my wife to go in and call the media but she was reluctant to do so.  We had been having rain showers prior to the incident and during the sightings I could hear sirens in the distance which were picked up on the video.  We decided to go back to our TV program and wait for the 10 o’clock news expecting that hundreds of people would be reporting the sightings.  Astonishingly, nothing appeared on the TV news or in the newspapers that evening or the days following.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A few days later I sent an email to friends and family describing what I saw and attached a few photos captured out of my very shaky video.  All had opinioned explanations of what they might have been like .... flares, fireworks or the like,  none of which matched the criterion of the scenario I observed.  It is not likely that flares or fireworks would rise out of the horizon, travel over several miles across a populated city and not draw somebody&#39;s  attention .<n> <n><n> <n><n> Commercial Pilot and Flight Instructor 10,000 Hrs.+<n>

As I got my camcorder position the object was moving from right to left in the sky.  I have no calculated measure of distance between my balcony door window and the position the object was sitting stationery in.  I don’t want to give an incorrect measure. I prepared my camcorder at 5:17 a.m. – 5:30 a.m. and videotaped the event I noticed for about 13 minutes. I spotted bright high beam lights bright enough to be blinding to the human eye, I noticed a blue color trying to detect the shape of this object unknown taking a guess maybe round shaped; I counted about 6 large round high beam lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was alone when I videotaped this activity in the sky this morning and this is not my first time spotting this type of activity.

The lights were as large and as bright as street lights, but in the sky and they didn&#39;t even come close to looking like the stars..<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first I thought they were planes, but there was NO way planes could move like these lights were.  The lights seemed to come closer and brighter and larger at the same time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The next thing they started to change formation from an octagon shape (like connect the dots)to a crooked line (hockey stick)<n> <n><n> <n><n> That&#39;s when I yelled to my husband and daughter to look outside.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The lights then started to move upwards, simultaneously and 1 by 1 they would dissappear.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have never seen anything like this in my life..  And I am still startled by it today.<n>

One large light appeared and then lights formed off of that one.  Then to the left of that light another large orange light appeared.  That light changed from one to two to theree to four then five.  All five lights were in a straight line with a slight curve and were still.  All the while the original lights off to the right were there.  Then they all disappeared.  This was over a 1-3 min period.<n>

I have seen unusual objects in the sky before, but primarily in my hometown of Santa Fe.  I am a frequent sky-watcher.  Living near an airport, I am very familiar with objects that are identifiable, like planes and helicopters and how they move and what lights they emit as well as sounds they make traveling overhead.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I went out to my backyard to check on my dog.  I looked up as I always do to check out the stars.  I was looking at the east sky when I noticed what looked like a star, a white light, moving slowly straight up in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I then saw a blinking green light positioned vertically under it, also moving up.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The lights changed position. They moved from being vertical to being horizontal to the sky line.  When this happened the white light changed color: turned orange-red.  The blinking green light began blinking red then green.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The began to move faster, as they picked up speed I could hear what sounded similar to plane noises, but different, almost a rumble.  The sound was loud compared to their distance away from my house.  I am used to hearing plane engine noise as I live near Double Eagle Airport, which is about 10 miles from my house.  Normally when the sound is as loud as I heard it, the planes appear closer to my location. The objects were traveling due west,not Northwest, which is where the airport is located from my house..<n> <n><n> <n><n> As the two objects began to travel west, dogs all over started barking as it flew overhead.  My own dogs were appearing agitated and looking up at the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They traveled together; leading was the orange-red light that was not blinking at all, followed by the blinking red and green light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I fixed my eyes on the space between the lights and something seemed fuzzy about the space in between, almost as if there was something being masked in the middle.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They begin to travel pretty quick.  I ran inside and then to the front yard which faces west.  I was able to watch them travel west until I could no longer make out the lights.<n>
4/24/14 20:30|Dauphin Island (off the coast of)|AL|Light|1 minute|5 lights in a up and down line going on one at a time then off one at a time.|5/2/14|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/109/S109038.html|132|ndxe201404| 5 lights in a up and down line going on one at a time then off one at a time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were sailing from the Venice, Louisiana, area to Pensacola, Florida, in our Catamaran sailboat across the Gulf of Mexico.  The night was very clear and there were lots of stars.<n> <n><n> <n><n> One of us noticed a bright white light over their right shoulder up in the night sky, they turned forward to check the boats position on the instruments then looked back to see the light and it was gone.  The other one of us was asleep but came up on deck about 10 minutes later to check on everything.  We were both noticing the stars when a very bright yellow white light came on in the sky to our right(South,Southeast). Then another bright yellow white light came on right below it until 5 total lights were on, in a line down with a space in between each light.  Then in the same order they had come on, they went off one at a time. It lasted less than a minute. We asked each other if we had both seen the same thing, we described it to each other and each of us had seen the same thing.  The one of us that had been asleep stayed up a while longer to see if it was going to come back.  After about 5 to 10 minutes, we had seen nothing more so the one of us went back to the room to sleep a while longer.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Almost immediately after leaving the deck, the lights came back, same pattern as before but this time they were over our starboard bow (Southeast) of the boat (front right side).  The one of us below deck saw the five lights go out, confirming that it was the same as before.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We did not see any additional lights in the sky that night.  We did not hear any odd noises or notice any other oddities while seeing these lights. We also did not notice any other colors with these lights, they just appeared bright yellow white lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We tried to rationalize the lights and decided it might be possible that a satellite may have been orbiting low in the Southern sky that night and maybe that was what we saw.  We also wondered if it was something odd flying from the Pensacola Air Force base, but we could not see any type of plane behind the lights.  We cannot find anything about a satellite but we did see a similar sighting mentioned on this website and on the web.  They sighted a pattern of lights off of Dauphin Island, Alabama, on March 23rd.<n>
4/24/14 20:30|Henderson/Las Vegas|NV|Sphere|5-10 minutes|I looked into the sky and saw two solid, white circular lights moving at the same speed, in the same direction.|5/2/14|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/108/S108899.html|133|ndxe201404| I was sitting in my car, after coming home from a dinner, when I looked into the sky and saw two soild, white circular lights moving at the same speed, in the same direction.  The light in front of the other one was more faint, and both lights were consistent with their brightness.  These looked very high in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I tried tracking these lights as far as I could, but eventually they faded into the night sky.   After observing more, I saw two blinking planes flying in the same pattern, in the same direction as the previous two lights! I was shocked!<n> <n><n> <n><n> After these planes were far in the distance, I looked directly up, and saw, YET ANOTHER faint orb travelling what seems to be very high in the sky, possibly above our atmosphere. It was moving in the opposite direction of the two previous sightings.  After this, I saw the last UFO, very similar to the previous one, and on the same path, except it was moving in the opposite direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have a video and picture of the first sighting.  I have lived in Las Vegas my entire life (22yo), and I know what planes (both commercial and military, we have bases near here) look like in the sky... the four orbs were NOT planes! I do believe the blinking objects were planes, but I found it quite curious they were in the same formation and flying in the same direction. :)  Maybe our military keeping an eye on things?<n>

PD))<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> KELOWNA, BRITISH COLUMBIA.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At 8:45 pm, I decided to go for a walk around the block for half hour to an hour.  I left my place and enjoyed a peaceful evening stroll.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was walking through a dark alley that cut through two apt building ending up at a old school that is across the road from the high school which has several large football fields.<n> <n><n> <n><n> While in the alley heading home, I talked briefly too a group of guys who claimed to have seen a UFO in the sky and if I hurried over to the field I could still catch them.  He pointed me in the direction that they seen the UFO and said they have to leave.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I hurried over too the field and did not notice anything and thought for sure I had missed them, shortly after about a minute of observing the sky I observed some lights that seemed to come from nowhere, I saw five bright circular lights in the sky that were in a boomerang like V formation, the UFO was in the very bottom part of the cloud layer and the clouds around the UFO’s lights vanished all around for hundreds of feet.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I felt a feeling of fear and astonishment when I first seen the craft, the lights were in the east direction moving south climbing in altitude, I observed the lights as they began to get smaller, the light started to pulsate and grow brighter when the UFO disappeared in a streak of light much like what a shooting star looked like only the streak of light traveled into space instead of the ground.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was still watching the sky and observed a light travel back from the direction in which it had shot away, the light was moving at super speeds because it traveled towards myself growing a bit brighter, the lights then slowed down and stayed stationary.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The sighting lasted for about ten minutes and occured just after 9 pm.  I could still make out the UFO when I left the school field.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I walked home very excited about what I had just observed and the first thing I was going to say to my room mate was if he wanted too come and take a look at a UFO in the sky near the high school, so I came upstairs gave his door a quick knock and entered his room.   I was instantly hit by a big gust of wind that made the curtains hit the roof and I almost blacked out, it felt like I had been drugged or was overcome by a deamonic dark presence,  I remember seeing a dark shadow creature come over me freezing me with fear.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I thought  to myself oh my god I just had my room mate abducted and I went to the living room where I noticed that 20 minutes had elapsed in 40 seconds, I looked around the house for my room mate and finally found him outside when I told him the things that had just happened, he didn’t think it was crazy at all.  I was overcome by an energy and dreading feeling that I had too get out of the house, I thought for sure I was going to be abducted and I did not want to put anyone’s life in danger.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I left the house and walked for about an hour too a picnic table at a small creek that was still in the city but it was late and I barely observed a vehicle.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At this time I was starting to calm down and was beginning to accept what had recently happened to me, I was a little bit on edge because I jumped when something came out of the bushes, it turned out to be a dog that stopped to take a drink out of the creek and continued on his way.  It was starting to get late, approximately 1 am, I grabbed my backpack and was about to head to the road when I heard something in the bushes again and thought it was the dog having another drink at the creek so I walked down to the waters edge to see if I could pet him and make a friend, I was mistaken because I observed two short human like creatures, around 4&amp;#8242; tall and a slender build, they had dark eyes that were larger then our own and no visible hair clothes to speak off. The creatures were dark In colour but not black, possibly a dark grey. I watched the ET’s run away from me running towards a carwash looking back at me for a glance, the one  jumped on top of a car with ease and ran over the top of it jumping down and continuing to follow the other  as they ran into the dark where I could not make them out.  I instantly thought” if they are running that way I am going this way” and I made my way to the brightly light highway that was nearby.  I was honestly scared of these things and all I wanted to do at this ! time was too feel safe.  I honestly don’t know what they were g! oing to do to me or why they ran away.  It has even crossed my mind that perhaps they were either coming to drink water from the creek or were stalking the stray dog that recently came from the path that the et’s were.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I accept now that we are not alone and am amazed at the fact that we have so many documented account of the same lights in the sky and the same creatures known as the Grey Aliens.<n>

I watched it, mesmerized, and then turned left onto Lerma road.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I pulled my vehicle to the side of the road &amp; observed it travel a short distance.

4/24/14 03:30|York|PA|Circle|15 seconds|Bright white circular light/craft in sky shoots down to 200-300 ft above ground, hovers, than shoots back up at extremely high speed|5/2/14|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/108/S108972.html|139|ndxe201404| Bright white circular light/craft in sky shoots down to 200-300 ft above ground, hovers, than shoots back up at extremely high speed<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was about 3:30 or 4 AM soon before I was going to go to sleep.  I have one of those green laser pointers and I thought why not go out and look at the stars for a little bit because it was one of the clearest nights it had been in a while.  To add to the darkness and clearness in the sky, one of my neighbors who always keeps his back light on happened to leave it off that night, so it was about the darkest I&#39;ve ever seen it in my backyard.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So I’m out on my back deck looking at the stars, shining different patterns and pointing out some constellations with the laser pointer for about 30 seconds to a minute, and all of a sudden a bright, round white light illuminates in the sky appearing to be about half the size of the moon at first.  From my position, I was looking up at it at about the 12:00 position but it was not directly above me, a little bit in front of me.  It was hard to tell how high up it was but it looked like it could have been star level.  Right when I saw it light up, it really took me by surprise and I was just thinking like what the hell is that thing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is where the story gets hard to believe.  After the object illuminated and appeared to remain still for a second or 2, it shot down from sky in in a complete vertical line to about 200-300 ft. above the ground (about 4-5 full tree lengths based on the trees it was above in my backyard), in only a matter of seconds.  When this happened, I was in complete shock and awe and dropped my laser pointer, just standing there and staring.  The light was so bright that it almost hurt my eyes but I couldn’t look away.  It seemed to be about the size of a car but completely round.  When it shot down, it was moving at speeds much faster than any type of aircraft that I’ve ever seen.  When it came to its stopped position, the light bent a little but then went back to its circular shape.  The light was completely white and like I said almost a little bit blinding.  Also, since I was looking up at it, it seemed like I was looking at the bottom of it and didn’t have a side-view, so the c! ircular shape that I saw may have just been the underneath of the structure.  It also emitted a soft, really low frequency sound as it hovered there but there was no sound when it was coming down.  It stayed completely still and hovered for about 5 seconds.  It truly felt like as I was staring at it, it was staring right back at me.  And then all of a sudden it shot strait back up into the sky vertically in the same path at an extremely fast rate of speed about equal to how fast it came down.  But when it shot back up it reached a certain point in the sky, and then paused for a second, then shot off westward at a sharp angle and then quickly disappeared.  One of the craziest parts to me is that I don’t even live in the woods or out in the middle of nowhere.  I live in your average suburban neighborhood.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Right after it happened, I went back in the house and went to bed immediately.  I thought about waking my dad up to tell him but it was really late and I was kind of trying to convince myself that I didn&#39;t really just see that.  I don’t want to tell a lot of people because I know that this story seems pretty crazy, but I know what I saw and I’m not lying.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

This was quite difficult to see given the light reflecting from Mars but by focusing it was quite visible.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The location appeared mostly constant but over time it would appear to move closer to the surface and then after a time move away again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I was observing this I noticed another light that was located in the seven o&#39;clock position much closer to the surface.  This light appeared to change position from at the surface to move towards and at times cover the surface or go behind Mars.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At just after four AM my wife got up and I immediately asked her to look at the this.  I did not tell her what I saw but asked her to look at Mars.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I wanted verification to what I was witnessing as I was wondering if I was seeing things that aren&#39;t there.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After a few seconds, she saw what I was seeing, only the lights appeared white to her.  I have no idea what these lights could be.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The only feelings I had were what in the hell was I seeing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This was visible to close to the time that Mars set around five AM.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We live at the edge of Edwards AFB and ten miles from any town, so it is quite easy to see objects in the night sky.<n>

I should have been reporting my experiences for the last 32 years.  2 years ago I had an extreme close flyby of a blue lightly glowing ball as big as my cab.  It darted across the highway in front of me and paralleled me on my right side and slowed down as it did. I have more questions and somewhat angry feelings with that one.  Primarily because I could have ditched my rig when it crossed in front of me.  Out of fear. Reckless &#34;ufo&#34;.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Sorry.  Tonight&#39;s encounter started as a ball of red light in the distance that did not move for a bit. I&#39;m approaching it at a few miles away..  So I&#39;ll just stay with what I saw and try my best to stay focused for you.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When it started coming more toward me eastbound along the highway it morphed to a green/blue.  No blinking lights at all.  It changed to a low lit white and then back to red.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was confusion in the cab with my gf and the iPhone and me not wanting to take my eyes off of it so nothing of worth was captured except us talking and I can&#39;t tell if the light in the video was the tower or not so..<n> <n><n> <n><n> I stopped the truck on the shoulder and this thing stopped moving too.  It was on my left near a tower with red lights and you couldn&#39;t tell the difference between the two.<n> <n><n> <n><n> More confusion in the truck and I was not responsive enough to obey the gf to simply take the phone and film.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It then changed to that Christmas green and it was a strange light.  Not a spotlight or incandescent type light. It was as if me eyeball was staring into a laser.  Best way to describe it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was a dancing brilliant blob if light and the way it shifted from red to green was odd.  Hard to describe.  Not like what I would see with a helicopter or plane.  After it changed green it started moving again eastbound following the highway.<n> <n><n> <n><n> No one was stopping to look at this thing!  It went low lit white real quickly after starting to move and by the time I stuck the phone out the window it was way behind me.  And just kept going.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I want to believe it stopped because I stopped.  But I have the gf who witnessed most of this but I don&#39;t think she was intent on really focussing on what was happening as I was.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The color morph was crazy beautiful.<n> <n><n> <n><n> One more thing, two really...  When it stopped i personally think it was mimicking the tower because of the sudden volume of traffic.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I also think it was doing a piss poor job of mimicking police helicopter lights.  I see them all the time here.  Not police helicopter lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was some kind of later like project ion in a blob form.  Like laser light in a semi incandescent form.<n>

While watching the object slowly move southward, approx. 3/10 mile as a deep ruby red color, it tuned into a deep blue color, still spherical or circular shape.  It was larger than a car and smaller than a house.  It was blue for approx. 10 seconds then turned completely deep red again.  It seemed to climb slowly to perhaps 300 - 350 ft., hover about 5 - 6 seconds then darted horizontally toward the northeast for a very short distance then quickly descended or dipped toward the ground toward Virginia Town Rd. and Fruitvale Rd. and out of sight.  We waited a while and did not see it again.  My friend thought it might be a RC helicopter but I know it was too big to be a model and moved to fast to be a model during the departure from the area. Flying a model requires line of sight and there are too many trees and power lines to fly in that area.  The red and blue colored light were bright and soft, a unique wavelength.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We rode through the neighborhood looking for anyone who might be flying a model.  No neighbors sighted outside.<n>

This is a follow up report.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We are still seeing the objects on a nightly basis.  Many more people are noticing them now.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have ready several reports of people seeing objects show up at dusk and remain all night long until the sun comes up in the morning.  That is the exact same thing we are dealing with in our area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Even before it is fully dark we are seeing these objects show up.  Some a solid white or orange while most flash Multi coloured lights of blue, green, red, and white.  Most stay in one one spot for the duration if the night while others fly around in circles surrounding the hovering ones. It almost as if they are supervising these Multi coloured ones.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We see some wobble around and bob around and the best way I can describe their movement is to tell you that they bob like a spider dangling on a web.   It&#39;s very strange.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Some will come down and weave in and out of the trees in the forest and if we shine a light in the tress to try and see these objects they will shut of their lights.  When they shut their lights off it looks like a kerosene heater going out.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My dogs act strange when they are around and lunge at the forest barking most nights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We are after having huge black triangles fly within 200 feet above our heads which are perfectly silent and if they went any slower they would fall out of the sky.  This has happened to my daughter and I twice while out driving around on our four wheeler.  Several neighbours have approached me and told me that they are seeing these things as well but said they won&#39;t tell anyone else because they don&#39;t want them to think they are crazy.  There are just so many and they come here every night.  This is a great place for investigators to come.  There is always something out there for them to see.<n>

I was traveling west on 75th Avenue when I noticed two very bright lights.  I thought it was just another car traveling because the two bright lights moved fluently and very smoothly much like a car with its brights on over the hills.  With so many hills in our neighborhood I thought nothing of it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I quickly realized I was wrong.  The two lights were not coming from a car but from a craft in the sky.  I realized it was a UFO.  The bright lights continued from west to east, fluently, over the trees and then made a right turn.  This turn  i would guess to be a 45 degree turn,  which allowed me to see two sides forming a v-shape.  It was moving at a steady rate of traffic so I would guess it was flying 45 to 50 mph.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I turned the corner, heading north on Jamestown, as the UFO was directly past.  I turned the corner and decided to follow.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was able to keep my eyes on it the entire time as I headed North on Harvard.  I immediately turned left. I could now make out the pyramid shape of the object from radiating off the golf course and also told me the craft  was now at 65th street between Harvard and Lewis.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At Lewis, the craft continued on till Riverside Drive then headed north following the interstate.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I got held up at the light and was unable to see it about a minute later when the five cars ahead of me had turned.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am certain others had to have seen this UFO in Tulsa and I am guessing it was the same craft that was identified in Kansas.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to provide no contact information.

4/23/14 21:16|Waipahu|HI|Sphere||Red sphere in night sky, flashes consecutive red/green lights at witness.|1/30/15|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/117/S117033.html|150|ndxe201404| Red Sphere in Night Sky, Flashes Consecutive Red/Green Lights at Witness<n> <n><n> <n><n> The following is what happened to me on 4/23/14 at 9:16 pm in front of my home on the island of Oahu-Honolulu, Hawaii:  On my way home alone from a nearby store, as I walked through my parking, I looked up in the night sky spotting a completley red sphere moving silently towards the northwest, at a fast rate of speed (its movement reminded me of a high traveling satellite).<n> <n><n> <n><n> As soon as I noticed the red orb (bigger than a helicopter, equivalent size to a small turbo-prop plane), I immediately realized it wasn’t a satellite, aircraft, or helicopter (it made no sound).  This orb seemed to notice me back (this was my initial gut-feeling), stopping dead in the sky at that moment.  Then it started quickly flashing a green light, then a red light, and then a green light at me, consecutively, around 6-8 times and then stopped, while remaining stationary in the sky above.  The colors reminded me of that popular electronic game in the 70’s, called Simon (best example of what the red/green lights looked like) with musical tones corresponding to it’s 4 large colored buttons when pushed; or the red and green colors of a traffic light.  However, there was absolutely no sound related to my sighting of this hovering red orb, it was completely silent.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It felt as if a message was being communicated to me directly, although I didn’t understand it. I mentally thought back to the object, “I don’t understand the message, what does it mean?”  As the orb still remained motionless in the sky above me, nothing more flashed towards me, nor did I get any other communication (gut-feelings/thoughts) from this object.  Next, I told the object mentally, “I believe you’re friendly, at least I think you are, but I’m not sure what it is you want.  I will tell you anything you want to know, you can ask me, but I don’t want to be abducted &amp; examined,” (laughing to myself now, knowing this sounds absurd as I stood in the dark staring at this sphere for around 5 minutes), although I was serious at the time this happened, and this was the dialogue running through my mind.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Shortly thereafter my neighbor came down the path, I instinctively knew I wasn’t going to share this with him (I don’t think he would’ve believed me anyhow), so I mentally said goodbye to the red orb, still remaining stationary in the sky above me at that time. Before I walked up my stairs, I greeted my neighbor who was unaware of the object.  As I walked up the stairs, I wondered if the red orb was still there. I called a close friend as soon as I walked in my place.  This friend said she believed my story, however I’ll never know for sure.  About a half hour later I did go back outside to see if the red orb was still there…it wasn’t.  I regretted leaving the encounter so soon.<n>

We thought it was a satellite at first but it was moving too slow.  I thought it might be the space station but it was too bright even for that and too slow.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then, as it moved above us, we noticed a red dot way out in front that must of been connected to the light because it moved like it was attached.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The whole craft must of been the size of a football field.  You could make out the shape like it was a triangle shape.  It was too slow for a plane.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then my friend noticed it was turning.

4/22/14 21:00|Cajah's Mountain|NC|Rectangle|1 minute|Driving on remote road, a rectangular craft trailed by a ball of light flew directly overhead about 45-60 feet with no noise.|5/2/14|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/108/S108911.html|168|ndxe201404| Driving on remote road, a rectangular craft trailed by a ball of light flew directly overhead about 45-60 feet with no noise.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My wife and I were driving home from my mom and stepdad&#39;s house on Connelly Springs Rd. between Cajah&#39;s Mountain, NC, and Rutherford College, NC, towards our house in Drexel, NC.  It was between 10PM and 11PM EST.  We were near a portion of the road where we cross over a body of water and there are a lot of trees and cover around.  My wife is in the passenger seat and tired, so she has her eyes closes and trying to catch a quick nap.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I didn&#39;t see the crafts approach, because of the trees.  But they appear to have came from my right and moving towards my left in a slightly forward angle.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The lead craft was a perfect rectangle with 1 consistent light in each corner and a slowly throbbing light in the bottom center.  There appeared to be a lot of textures on the bottom, also.  The textures reminded me of a large computer chip, with seemingly random bumps and links, none of which were lit and were only visible when the center light throbbed at it&#39;s brightest.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The trailing craft was much, much smaller and didn&#39;t appear to be more than a ball of light.  There was no visible wings, texture, or craft.  It was like a ball of white light gliding through the sky, but was keeping perfect distance slightly behind the rectangular craft (maybe 2-2.5 craft-lengths behind).<n> <n><n> <n><n> Besides the appearance of the craft looking like no Earthly craft I&#39;ve ever seen, the really odd things were the elevation, speed, and noise.  The trees lining the road are 15-20 feet tall, I would estimate.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Elevation:  The crafts were low enough that I was concerned it could have been a crashing plane, until I saw they were not losing elevation.  They couldn&#39;t have been more the 45-60 feet in the air.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Speed:  The crafts weren&#39;t going 100s of miles an hour, like you would expect an air-born plane or other craft to go.  They appeared to be slowly gliding.  Almost as if they were just cruising and so slow that it in-fact gave the impression they could speed up, slow down, or even stop as need (almost like a car).  To give you an idea of their speed: The road is 1 lane on each side and a dirt shoulder on either barely wide enough to pull a car on to before you get to the treeline, and from the time they appeared over the trees to the right and disappeared over the trees to the left was about 1 verse and chorus/hook in the song I was listening to (Outsiders - Eric Church).<n> <n><n> <n><n> Noise:  Like I said, my wife was trying to fall asleep in the passenger seat with her eyes close.  The craft were so noise free that she never opened her eyes.  I never asked her to, because I was in disbelief of what I was seeing and kind of frozen.  She never knew they were there, never seen them.  An Earth-made aircraft flying that close to the ground and pretty much directly over your head would make it impossible to sleep or even ignore.  I never heard a single noise from either craft.  Also, they never disturbed the trees.  There was no blowing leaves around, no pick-up of wind at all.  It was as though they weren&#39;t there.<n>

I routinely stop at the top of the North Carolina, Tennessee Mountain, called Sam&#39;s gap.  This is an area where truckers will routinely stops and shut down for the evening to sleep or take their 30 minute break, like I do nightly. I was standing outside my truck viewing upwards, when two other truckers started waving their hands and yelling lookup , lookup.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was already looking upward, however out of my peripheral vision, I saw a triangular craft, with red and blue lights at each point of the triangle flashing wildly, that literally went from one side of the sky to the other, blocking out the stars behind the triangle as it moved across the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> No sound what so ever, and it appeared to cross the sky in about 3 to 5 seconds.  It was unbelievable.  This area has no lights to speak of, other than the occasional truck passing over the mountain, so it is a wonderful area just see God&#39;s creation.  I have a college degree from Charleston Southern University, 1980, and spent many years in upper level management, managing service contracts throughout the Pacific Rim, but specifically in Kuala Lumpur Malaysia.  I do not know the other truckers as we just refer to each other as drivers, but we all threesaw this is triangular shape craft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After it passed over who is somewhat looked at one another in disbelief.  One of the other truckers stated that he was not going to say anything to anybody for fear of ridicule.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So I am really putting myself out here by generating this report to you Peter.  I am a nightly coast to coast listener and have been listening since the Art Bell days.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We appreciate what you do out there Peter.   Keep up the good work.<n>

Whenever they passed in the bright one&#39;s vicinity, they slowed down and dipped.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This went on for an hour.<n>

I then knew it wasn&#39;t a helicopter because it was too fast.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After moving at a slight angle to our right it curved its direction and starting heading away from us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My friend had said it might be a flare, but we all knew otherwise and it had been getting further and further away slowly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It looked like a fireball at first, but without any fire, then more like just a big orange ball of light, but was too far away to see any detail at all.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After moving further away it disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were shocked, but I knew it just was too far to see, until it came back into sight heading back in our direction.  It came back to the point that it had been at before, moving slowly compared to any meteor, but fast compared to a firework.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It then turned back around almost instantly without rotating and then slowly disappeared again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This lasted for about 8 to maybe 12 minutes in total.<n>

Tamalpais when I saw two huge rectangular shaped lights coming tpwards me with some kind of invisible object in between.  These two lights merged into one giant light which materialized into a giant upside down funnel looking cone which next took on the shape of a domed disc which kept getting thicker on the sides and more rounded while I watched it.  It started drifting toward a nearby hill and turned into what I would have to say is the identical Carlos Diaz plasma type craft seen in Mexico.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This object next took on the shape of an oval turtle shell looking object, kind of lumpy and rigid looking before finally turning into a long glowing orange object that looked like a croissant that you would get at a bakery.  It was a blinding fluorescent orange and slightly bent at the end and seemed to drift right into this hillside or go behind it and never reappear again.  Meanwhile I was seeing clusters of these orange lights appearing over this hillside for a solid two hours that just seemed to come out od nowhere all taking on an orangish glow.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Much of these objects just looked like four pointed stars and were consistantly appearing in pairs and clusters.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We are unclear as to whether this is a serious report.

Noticed a bright orange light moving across the sky.  There were several planes visible during this time too that were much smaller dots in the sky with blinking lights as you&#39;d expect to see on aircraft.  I&#39;m also familiar with what satellites look like too.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This orange light was a solid light that almost seemed to twinkle as it moved across the sky toward the south.  Much bigger in size than the surrounding aircraft flying in the vicinity, but still obviously distant in the clear sky.  After watching it move in awe trying to run to every rational checklist I could think of for about 3-4 minutes it just suddenly disappeared.  Like the bright orange light had been flicked off like a light switch.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My son witnessed this first event with me.  I told my husband as we loaded our kids in our separate vehicles, after visiting family for Easter.  He had just missed the sight and blew me off when I told him I couldn&#39;t logically explain wh! at I had just seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We drove around the corner approx 1/4 mi. to our home.  As we both pulled our vehicles in the driveway I noticed the bright orange light again!  It was back to the north of us again moving in the same direction the other light had.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This time my husband saw it too. We stood in our street watching this mysterious light move silently to the south for just under 5 minutes. Just like before it seemed to suddenly disappear.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My husband told me he was sorry for not taking me seriously the first time for he too could offer no plausible explanation.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We waited about another 10 min outside scanning the sky and only saw the obvious aircraft and stars in the sky.  Then I spent 15 min. inside trying to assure my son it was a balloon or something, because he was very unsettled about the sighting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I did not want him to worry so I fibbed and told him it was probably blown away from a nearby business.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I couldn&#39;t convince myself though because the object was way too bright to be a balloon, or a candle inside a plastic bag as my mom suggested wh en I called her and told her what we saw.  And why the twinkling effect then?  Was it surrounded by a material that bends light as it emits or passes thru the object?<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;m convinced this is not a case of mistaken identity. Something weird and curious passed thru the high desert sky tonight.<n>

It was actually spotted by one of my supervisors while we were on the tarmac at Ted Stevens not far from the UPS and FedEx parking.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When we first spotted it, it was moving about randomly low along the mountain slope in a weird, unpredictable circular pattern like it was pacing a bit before it started traveling across a greater distance and at a slightly faster speed.  The unknown object&#39;s bright white blinking light moved fast low on the mountains in almost a straight line after about a minute or two, still flashing.  The time posted is estimated.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It moved far too low and too fast to be any sort of small aircraft or military aircraft, or even a vehicle which might have made the most sense, but even then the light was too bright and flashing too constantly at such a distance, and they generally don&#39;t flash that bright while moving either.  It covered a lot of ground and seemed to disappear closer to the Cook Inlet by where i live farther south along the mountains towards Girdwood.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Note that had it been bright enough or a normal moving flying object i would have seen it past the last visible slope of the mountain chain in the south Anchorage area unless it turned around the bend out of sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Regardless it seemed way too bright and big for any sort of ground vehicle, and I can tell the difference between small aircraft, helicopters and higher flying jets at night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Unfortunately I was not able to get any videos due to the distance this object was spotted at, nor would the results be good with the camera on my smartphone.<n>

The tower closed at 9:00pm local time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was on the ground, having just stepped out of a restaurant on west International Drive in a relatively dark area.  We saw what appeared to be traditional red/green navigation lights moving exceedingly fast across the sky, east to west, in a downward arc.  Thinking this was an aircraft in distress, I expected to see an explosion as it hit the ground.  Instead, it stopped behind a building in the distance and climbed in a completely vertical approximately 200-300 feet, then it stopped and made and IMMEDIATE right turn to the North/Northwest.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In my experience, there is no fixed wing or rotorcraft that can possibly move at the speeds this object moved or execute the maneuvers of this object.

The sun had set behind me (to the west) but the sky was still to bright to see anything in that direction, thus I was looking easterly.  At the time I was looking through a 40 mm lenses and using an 80mm telescope which gives approximately 10X magnification.  At this magnification mars fills about ½ the visual field.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is when something transited from right to left (south to north) through the field of view at what appears to be Mars’s equatorial region.  This is to say, it was observed in the field of view beyond Mars and passed somewhere between earth and Mars, exiting my field of view well past Mars.  Indicating it was NOT on Mars, but between Earth and Mars.  (Perhaps, this object was in Earth orbit?)  This pass lasted for only a fraction of a second and the object appeared white (I am color blind, but it appeared white to Mars’s red body with white polar caps as I see them.)  This object was tiny, almost appearing as a grain of sand. I immediately pulled my head back to see with my unaided eye, but saw only Mars.  (Note: no other planets nor stars were yet visible due to the fading sunset.)  My binoculars (25X70) were next to my telescope, so I grabbed them and scanned the area but saw nothing.  The object was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At this point, I ruled a lenses flair, the angle of the sun and my telescope was incorrect.  Due to the recent freezing temperatures, there were no insects flying around and insects have never been visible to me through that level of magnification.  I considered a satellite, but the orbit seems wrong and the app on my phone did not show any satellites in that vicinity.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am not entirely certain this was a craft…I do not know what it was, but if others saw this, I would like to validate their sighting.<n>

As it turned I was looking for a strobe light like on a plane, there was nothing no noise either, then as it turned to the west holding its altitude of maybe 3-4 thousand feet,  the flickering fire looking light turned to a more solid appearing orange-yellow light.  I ran into the house to get my binoculars as quick as I could.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I came out the the object was farther away still going west, then it appeared to just nose dive and went out of site, a few seconds later I saw a second orange flickering light object farther away to the southwest towards downtown phoenix flying level for a few seconds and it too nose dived out of sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The third object came  approx. 20 seconds later with the same flight path as the first one.  And  again where the first one turned, this one did as well at the same altitude.  This time having the binoculars I started to look for it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As it turned away, I saw it, either it was oval  or round  being in a banking turn and out the back end of it where several maybe 6-8 equally spaced bright solid yellowish lights where the back end of it would be.  I had a good eyeball on it as it turned, then all of a sudden those lights I was looking at out the back of it went dark, yet I was still panning on a dark object in the sky afterwards for a few seconds more.<n>

I hoped for another day where it would come again while I was not alone so I wouldn&#39;t feel so crazy when explaining a huge flying flame right over my head with black gases rolling around in it to people. lol  I honestly keep it a little hush because it is so bizarre.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Well tonight, at about 10:20 pm almost exactly a year later, finally, I saw it again and it was moving through the same exact area as I saw it last time, my sisters yard.  It was not nearly as close to me as the last one was, therefor it wasn&#39;t as large, but the plus side to tonights odd fireball sighting was that my sister and my niece both saw the flying orange flame right along side of me.  My skeptical side thought Chinese lantern at first due to its size BUT I quickly changed my mind.   We watched it travel through the yard at about the height of the tree line, moving west in a straight line, not up, not down, but mostly straight, much faster than the one I saw last year, it continued a good straight distance then up a little higher to avoid some trees then straight again until it appeared to stop about a mile or two away where it hovered and began slowly changing colors from orange to red to green to a silver/white color while just hovering.  Seemed to be a little above the! tree line at this point and way below the skyline.  It remained in that same exact spot for at least 30 minutes.  After running to the front and watching it from our street for forever. We got in the car to drive to it and at one point had it in our sight directly in front of our vehicle about half a mile up a country road.  As we drove straight towards it we came down a hill and when we got to the top, a second or two later, it was no longer in front of us.. just gone.  Looked to the right of us, eastwardly, and there it was back in the direction of our house again where we had just left from about another two miles away.  Almost as if to avoid us.  How did it get from in front of our car to 2 miles away in another direction in a matter of 2 seconds? Again, I am so baffled. We all are! And Last year, even though my sister and niece experienced the huge white streak across the sky about 20 minutes after my first fireball sighting, I am so very glad that someone else finally saw t! he orange flame object that I saw last year! I just wish it wa! s closer like it was last year. Don&#39;t get me wrong... It was still very close but not nearly as close as it came to me last year. BUT This time my video worked :) and I have a lot of pictures. Im thinking it was so close to me last time that it interfered with my cell and it also knocked our cable out. This time, there was a little distance so my phone did not fail! But the same exact thing happened where it appears much much smaller in video and pictures than what we visually saw. Also the shape changes in the video and pictures than what we visually witnessed as well. Its so bizarre and I feel like a crazy person when I try to explain it lol A couple pics and the video showed two and three fireballs but we could only see one with our eyes. The shape and movement and all around appearance of what we visually saw is totally different than how it shows up in pics and videos. Its a blatant flame like object when you look at it but in the video and pics it shows up as an orange boomara! ng shaped object and sometimes orb like and even shows up as more than one object in some of the pics and video but visually we could only see one. It is so bizarre but almost identical to my experience last year. The object was way to close to be a meteor or plane.. It was right at the tree line. It most definitely was not a lantern. It traveled straight not up with no wind and too fast. When the video i have is played in slo motion the object is totally different than what we could visually see with our eyes. Matter of fact it wasn&#39;t even moving in a straight line on the slowed video but visually, with our own eyes it was traveling straight. The video shows erratic movements sometimes appears to be spinning and jolting up and down side to side but it must have been doing this so fast that we saw something different thru human eyes. When it left and hovered a mile or so away it changed to different colors. This is the 2nd time in the same spot that I have seen this and I a! m intrigued and baffled. Again, i have pics and video.<n>

Total time about 18 minutes|4/24/14|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/108/S108755.html|259|ndxe201404| 9 Very brightly lit (red and yellow) saucer shaped crafts. Total time about 18 minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At approximately 10:01 pm in Chico, California, I first viewed a very bright red light with a yellow one in the center.  I had walked out on the back porch and was watching this thing move very rapidly through the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I called my wife out to see if she could recognize what this thing was.  It was moving very fast.  There was NO way these were military flares because they were so bright but not only moving toward the North but were also rapidly moving upward until it blanked out of sight.  I would guess this object was between 10,000 and 15,000 feet up.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We thought the sight was over until about 15 seconds later a second one appeared and looked as if it was going a little faster but lower, then five to 8 seconds later a third appeared, then a fourth.  We tentatively watched these things wondering what they were.  I did call 911 and operator took the report and was teasing a little like we were seeing things until the 911 center started to light up.  I hung up with 911 and continued watching with my wife when in about 5 minutes went by and 911 called me back and gave me the number for the National UFO Reporting Center.  I didn’t know this even existed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We continued watching these “things” go by.  We moved out into our parking lot where we could see with a completely unobstructed view.  I a total of 15 minutes went by after 911 called back, my wife and I witnessed a total of (9) nine of these very strange and very fast moving craft.  I would guess these things (crafts) or what ever they were, was moving Northward at what I am guessing to be about between 4 to 5 times the speed of sound.   Not even a sound was heard but as they were going by so fast, again heading Northward but also climbing upward rapidly until they completely blinked out of sight.  Yes, I will be very honest with you, I would really like to know what they were.  	(Very Curious.)<n> <n><n> <n><n> I felt strange reporting what I saw because I know the operator thought at first I was some kind of a nut.  Then she said the 911 lines were all lighting up.  They, (these strange crafts) appeared to have 5 maybe 6 very, very bright red lights with a very bright yellow one in the center.  I have NEVER seen any military craft be able to move that fast and have that bright of lights under them.  There was NO aircraft strobe lights and way, way too bright to be aircraft marker lights.  After minutes of watching them, I was all worked up but now see no more objects in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke via telephone with this witness on two occasions, and he seemed to us to be a very sober-minded individual.  He reported during one of those conversations that the individual objects were appeared approximately the same size of a full Moon in the night sky, so they were quite prominent in the night sky.

We used a degree finder to be as close to  how much of an angle we were watching.  The degree finder gave us a value of 197° until each of them went straight up, so high as to we couldn’t see then anymore and basically they blinked out.  Again I am NOT sure as to exactly what my wife and I were watching.  She definitely did NOT get worked up as much as I did, because again I wasn’t sure what exactly it was we were watching.<n> <n><n> <n><n> OK, I do have an update as to the direction they were traveling.  You asked what direction the travel was.  As by compass the (Crafts) or whatever, they were came from the Southeast and was traveling I the direction of the Northwest.  I know you said you had sightings of the same things just South of Seattle Washington, but somewhere the (crafts) must of changed direction of travel.  Again, this started at 21:01 hours and this lasted about a total of 29 minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Contacting the National Weather Service about wind speed at our level, which there was NO wind on the ground but you want wind speed at 3000’ and 6000’.  The closest we can come with since all we can seem to get are recorded messages, but the wind speed at about 3000’ was North West at about 10mph.  At 6000’ they weren’t very clear but again North West at between 15 and 20mph.  You also requested to contact the F.A.A., that was a total joke especially in this area, all we could get were recorded messages, NO matter what department we pushed the buttons on the phone to get to.  All  we could get were recorded messages then when finished, there were NO areas to leave a message it just simply just hangs up.  To be honest, right now I am almost sorry I reported what my wife and I were watching and probably will NOT do so in the future.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We are trying very hard to do the right thing and make the calls you requested we make and all we seem to get is stonewalled.  I really don’t need this.  Right now we have about five (5) hours trying to report what we were watching.  Again like I explained, I did contact our newspaper office, again to get a recording.  And in the past 5 and ½ hours they have refused to return the telephone call, I know because of what it was.  OK, I am going to try to get six (6) radio stations involved and two (2) two Television Stations, and hopefully again we will NOT get stonewalled again.  Up here I already have over 20 people looking down their noses at us.  This is really making the both of feel like fools.  Again, you are right, I cannot possibly tell you the exact speed and height of the (crafts) we were watching.  I have a very close guess since we do have an airport very close to us and watch jet aircraft all the time and 1 and 2 times the speed of sound.  Normally, anytime this happens there is a very large sonic boom.  These (crafts) last night were totally and I mean totally silent.<n> <n><n> <n><n> You asked about the size of the (crafts) against a possible full moon, We both can tell you our guess they were at least 10,000’ feet up but they were large enough even at that height these (crafts) were would completely cover a full moon plus some.  And according what I could see against a very clear sky,  Above the very bright RED and Yellow lighting, the (crafts) appeared to be a saucer shape.  Again, the sky was clear as a bell.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We hope this answers some of the questions you had, especially since we are getting stonewalled where ever we have called, now we are getting laughed at by the media also.  I do know in Chico right now there were several more people I personally know witnessed the very exact same thing.  I have tried very hard to get them to come forward with you and submit a report also.  This is with NO avail, they are all too afraid of being laughed at.  Personally, I don’t give a d**** what other people think, this is what my wife and I were watching, and other that being stonewalled with the National Weather Service, the F.A.A. and the news media I just simply want you to know what we were seeing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My curiosity is very high to know exactly what those (crafts) were we were watching.<n>

I first noticed two bright orange-colored lights moving across the night sky as I was driving Northeast on E. 1st Avenue in the city of Chico, CA.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I immediately pointed out the lights to my 13 year-old daughter, who asked me what I thought they were.  I pulled the car over at the nearest safe place, at 1035 Village Lane.  We exited the car and immediately noticed that several other lights were appearing over the trees from the horizon.  We were facing the Southeast.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The lights would appear over the horizon from the Southeast and travel Westward.  The lights appeared in pairs as if they were in a formation.  The lights had a steady, light-orange tint to them and were fairly large.  It was hard to judge their size, but I&#39;m familiar with how bright and large Venus can appear, so I would approximate their size as if 5 or more Venuses were put together into a single object.  The objects would travel in a straight course, heading Westward and then disappear from the sky.  No noise was emitted from the objects.  We observed the lights for a total of about 10 minutes.  Most of the objects appeared to have a constant speed, with one object being fairly faster than the others.<n> <n><n> <n><n> During this period of observation my daughter took a one-minute video of some of the objects with her ipod.  She captured three or four of the objects as they moved through the sky.  I will email the video after finishing this report.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After pulling over at 1035 Village Lane, I called my wife (our house is close to where my daughter and I were making our observations) and asked her if she saw anything in the sky.  Both she and my 16 year-old son went to the front yard and saw some of the lights my daughter and I observed in the Western sky.  However, my wife and son both reported seeing other objects to the East.  They saw two dimmer objects compared to those seen the West.  They seemed higher and farther away.  First she saw two separate lights come close together and they appeared to cross each others flight path.  One light continued on its flight path, while the other turned into three distinct luminous objects, and then quickly merged into one object again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It is interesting to note that this observation was made in the medium-sized city (population 87,000) of Chico, CA.  The Chico Municipal Airport is not far away from the observed lights and the lights appeared to be fairly close to the usual air-traffic patterns of the airport.<n>

At about a minute into it, I had looked away and my son, ((son&#39;s name deleted)), said he saw a light chasing it and it disappeared.  I never saw it and thought perhaps he was just seeing the reflection from the Space Station since this was his first time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At about 2200 Hrs, I was looking to the south at about 50* center in front of me facing the south and I had saw a satellite.  Make note:  Between 21:36 and 2200 Hrs. we had seen at least 10 plus satellites that seemed to be going north to South and South to North passing the Big Dipper.  Can’t remember a time when there were so many in the sky in a short time. This satellite I saw in the south was going from SNW to SSE and then I saw what appeared to be another satellite about 3 fingers right behind it.  However, these two were going a little bit faster than the normal satellites.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I got my son to look and he locked onto them an then it appeared these were lights and the #2 was following in pursuit of the other #1 light.  Just as the #2 increased speed and a little distance the #1 light increased speed and disappeared as the #2 light disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have seen lights do weird stuff, but to see these two lights in the sky that were not lanterns and looked like stars or satellites move through the sky like they did and vanish was an incredible rush to share with my son at my age of 51.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thank you for allowing me to share my observation.  Not sure what my son saw, but we both saw this!  I just wanted to post this report in case others saw this.<n>

4/18/14 21:00|Richmond Heights|OH|Unknown|15-20 seconds|Two fast-moving, low altitude landing lights on nearly silent aircraft.|4/24/14|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/108/S108773.html|268|ndxe201404| Two fast-moving, low altitude landing lights on nearly silent aircraft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was about 21:00 on Friday evening, April 18th.  The sky was overcast. We were overflown by an aircraft with what appeared to be two white landing lights.  It looked to be flying low, maybe at about 500 to 1000 feet up.  It came roughly out of the north, flying towards the south.  We were in front of the Indian restaurant at the intersection of Wilson Mills Road and Richmond Road in Richmond Heights, Ohio.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Cuyahoga County airport is just a couple of miles north of that location between Richmond and Bishop Roads.  So  I just assumed it was a small plane or business jet taking off and gaining some altitude. But two things were unusual for me &amp; my wife.  First it was really clipping along.  It seemed to be going really fast for as low as it was flying.  And secondly, the darn thing was nearly silent.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After it was a bit south of us and we lost the two lights in the clouds we thought we heard a low rumble of a jet.  My wife noted:  &#34;Why do we hear it now and not when it was right over us?&#34;  I live about 3-4 miles southwest of Cuyahoga Country airport and we are overflown by their small business jets.  They make a lot of noise.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This thing was just too fast and too quiet to seem right.  I had read about the triangular UFO craft, but we saw no outline of the craft.  And it was just two white lights, not three.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had been a bit curious about the airport. About 4 years ago they put a 33KV, three-phase power feed from the intersection of Bishop &amp; Highland Roads which runs north on Bishop until it is next to the airport grounds, right in front of the Swaglok company buildings.  Then it runs down a power pole and into the ground.  No other customers tie into that power feed along Bishop Road, before it goes underground.  Maybe they have some machinery/technology that needs a lot of power.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There is also a company right around the corner from Swaglok on Avion Park Drive that does work on those &#34;memory metals&#34; - - - the ones you can deform and then they regain their original shape after being heated with a torch.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Might all be coincidence. Maybe there was a weird air layer that reduced the jet noise level.  But I don&#39;t think that was the case.  That was one low-flying, fast moving, nearly silent pair of white lights.<n>

PD))|4/24/14|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/108/S108800.html|272|ndxe201404| Two white lights, one beam &amp; amoeba shaped white object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was home alone with the exception of my 3 year old daughter. We have been experiencing some strange things around our home/property therefore installed 2 outdoor surveillance cameras a few weeks ago.  One points toward the street in front of our home.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I put my daughter to bed then walked through the kitchen past camera monitor.  Something caught my eye.  I looked at the screen and saw what appeared to be a large white item with no particular shape flowing above the ground in the front yard.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first I thought it may be a trash bag, until I realized the wind wasn&#39;t blowing to that magnitude plus the object wasn&#39;t moving around- it was stagnant above the ground in a flowing motion.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was a &#34;pole&#34; or light beam coming from the top of the object- comparable to a flag on a pole upside down.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I tried to figure out what this was, it proceeded to fly up in the air, go above and over my horse trailer, back down a little and out of sight of the camera.  I sat there, staring for a moment when I saw something else moving around the horse trailer.  It was like a light beam- a thin beam of light yet there was no change in width.  It was the same width as far as I could see it and also &#34;skipped&#34; some space in the beam.  Like a pole with occasional dead space.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I watched this beam move around the hprse trailer- like it was scoping something out- it moved above the trailer and &#34;did a little dance&#34; then back down and around the trailer again.  Then, 2 circular bright white lights appear in view of the camera in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I quickly took out my phone and began to record the monitor screen, not knowing if my husband had set the cameras to record.  The lights in the sky (one just above the other) moved together at first then parted and &#34;danced&#34; around and came back together. It hit me I should go outside to see what this was.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Again, we have been privy to strange and unexplainable situations since moving to this home 4 years ago.  I didn&#39;t feel threatened but did feel very! anxious I went outside quickly and looked up and around- nothing was there.  I ran back inside and it was all still there on the monitor.  I began to record again for a few moments when I decided to go back out and check again, just to make sure- nothing was there.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I go back inside and check the monitor- the activity stopped and was gone or no longer visible.  I admit to shedding some tears and I&#39;m a pretty strong woman, not one to cry at anything or nothing.  I was overcome with emotion and unsure of what to think or how to feel.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My background- I am a credible witness, in my opinion. I am an honest, respected &amp; well-known member of the community.  Contrary to living in MS, I am college educated and have established &amp; operate a non-profit organization that works closely with local law enforcement.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I would not expect anyone that knows me to say that I am weird, on drugs, a fabricator or dramatic. My husband works from home for a respected computer company.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have video and photos of this occurrence.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We see no UFO in the two photos sent.

We are in the age range of late teen to early 20&#39;s. We do not drink. I had already gotten dark.   My one friend said, “woa, look at that!”. In the west/northwest sky we saw a very bright red light.  It came up over the houses, and then began to silently hover.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We thought it was a parachute flare because it looked fairly low, however I know for a fact that most parachute flares only stay lit for 40 seconds.  It had that bright red fiery glow flares have!  They also make noise when being fired off when you’re at a close distance. This stayed lit for around 5 minutes.  It began to fade, but never came down.  In fact I believe it faded because it was going up!  Eventually it looked like it went up into the clouds.  It then disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Well, it was very interesting.  That alone made us excited.  Then after around 10 minutes later, the same light came back down briefly!  It hovered again for maybe a minute, then went back up again and disappeared.  Nobody else saw it from what I know. I don’t understand how somebody else could not  have seen it!  It was too amazing to be ignored.  This is the second time I have seen this type of ufo in my town.  The first was about two years ago.  We are close to several military bases including Site R, and Camp David if that has anything to do with it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I take my video camera with me wherever I go...of coarse on this night I decided to leave it home!  Never again will I make this mistake.<n>

It appeared similar to a well lit Venus.  (Meaning slightly larger and brighter than your average star in the sky).<n> <n><n> <n><n> But this object was much lower in the horizon than any other star and it was moving in a straight path towards us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It slowed down almost to a stop for several seconds overtop us and our campfire, which is when we learned of its shape and the two red blinking lights.  One on each&#34; wing&#34;and a single white/yellow solid light on the mid to frontal section, quite large and bright giving it the appearance of a star in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Also, we heard a very faint hum coming from the object.  Not soon after losing sight of the first object, we spotted a second object coming from a different area but displaying similar characteristics to the first.  And after the second passed out of sight, a third wa! s seen coming from a different location in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> These objects have become regularly seen between 10 pm and midnight on clear nights.but<n> <n><n> <n><n> On a regular night I havent seen many past midnight.  One other detail I have noticed is most if not all objects observed around midnight are travelling in a northward direction.  But then earlier in the night, the more random their direction of travel seems to be.<n>

Helicopters are common to fly in the area, and I like to check them out whenever I can.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So I stepped outside and listened to the noise in the direction it was coming from.  I saw a blacked out helicopter with a red light on its tail and a strobe on its front.  Okay... that&#39;s strange for a helicopter.  I had this feeling it was trying to be incognito.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then, I looked at a bright orange light ahead of the helicopter.  I immediately ran into the driveway to take a better look, then I noticed another orange light a great distance from the first orange light, except this one was more faint.  The lights moved at the same speed, same direction heading northwest, towards Faith, NC.  The lights never flashed.  Nor was there any sound.  Only the helicopter was making sound.  Planes fly around here all day and night, so I can detect aircraft real fast, but not these orange lights.  Something about them stumped me and I couldn&#39;t ever come to a conclusion what they were.  I have never seen anything like this before.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Seconds after the sighting I ran inside and explained to my mom what I saw, and quickly drew a picture of what I saw.  I&#39;m willing to show the picture as well.<n>

They met in the middle of 3 stars that formed a triangle,<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then came back down and flew low in the sky again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I got home I saw it again in the sky.

Out of the blue an immensely bright, very large white light appeared out of nowhere.  It was significant is size and was moving very quickly at a low altitude.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It appeared to be very close - no more than a few hundred feet up.  It was moving extremely fast and then it suddenly turned in a complete u-turn and then a second later completely disappeared.  It was over with before I could blink.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was with a friend and did not say anything because it happened so quickly.   I thought I might have imagined it but then my friend said &#34;Did you see that?&#34;.  I was a little relieved that she saw it too.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first I thought it was a fireball but the more I think of it, the more I am convinced that it wasn&#39;t....

He said that there was a shooting star falling out of the sky.  I took a look up in the south east direction from my Florham Park yard.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I initially saw what looked like plane, as it was the most logical thought.  Note that I do live near Morristown Airport, so I just assumed it was a low flying plane.  But it wasn’t flying like a plane.  It was moving a slower and there was a change of speeds.  It seemed to be flying at a steady pace at first, but then slowed down and with that change of pace was a slight change in direction.  Seemed odd to me.  This is when I thought it was more than a plane.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After it flew for what seemed like  a minute, I had a hard time making it out and seemed to have disappeared from my view.   In regards to the object itself, I would say it was just 1 color.  It was an orange color of lights.  It appeared to be diamond shaped.  I even said to myself that it looks like a kite with lights around it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In what might be a coincidence, after the object went out of view, there was a plane that seemed to be flying in that same direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My thought on that was it saw what I saw and was going to take a closer look.<n>

I was looking at the Yellowstone North Entrance - Electric Peak Webcam.  Surprised I saw a blue/white orb on the ground.  At first I thought it was a trough of water.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The bison did not seem disturbed at first but with every 2 minutes the webcam changed they moved away and so did the orb.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I kept watching the orb as it continued to move positions every 2 minutes along with the bison.  When it moved further away from the position of the camera I began to see a wide light coming from it like the reflection of the moon.  It was then when I noticed way out in the distance in the rolling hills another part of an orb.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After awhile where the end of the orb light was shining it began to turn a light red until it was a very dark neon pink with two bright white rectangle lights... one on each side.  This light became more intense for about 4 minutes.  Then it all totally disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It came back and I did take a print screen this time so I do have a few pictures of the red neon light and gold with the orb.<n>

It had what appeared to be a streak behind it at first site then just nothing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Initially I thought it was a &#34;falling star&#34; but second guessed what I said and what I just seen.  I have seen shooting stars, meteorite that light the sky up totally but each one move so fast and emit a &#34;blue&#34; glow and are either falling at a sharp angle or burning out as they cross the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This particular sighting did not have those characteristics and it seemed as though it had a streak at first then just vanished with what I thought was a flash after it disappeared way to the south.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The next day as I spoke of this to my brother, my other nephew said to me that he too saw the same thing.  He was next door and was just walking to his truck to go home from visiting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We are close to an Air Force Base and there a lot of unusual noises and lights around the area lately.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.

I was driving north on 31 not quite half way between Peru and Rochester...  Not too sure exactly where but it was about 10.03 pm  Yes I looked at my clock as it flew over me).  I just looked over to the west and spotted want I thought was a really bright star and to be honest, didn’t think anything of it.  I just kept driving. I looked over again and it seemed to be much bigger and brighter.  As I watched it (as well as try to keep my eyes on the road, it started to get closer.  It was very low to the ground and seemed to be no more than a couple of hundred feet up.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The bright light suddenly split into two lights (it probably was 2 lights all the time but as it was in the distance, looked like one).  I tried to see if I could make out any of the normal colored lights that all aircraft have on them but could not see any.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As it got closer, I realized it was big.. I could see smaller white light down the sides of it.  As I started to make out a shape (now take into account it was dark so as we know, eyes play tricks in the dark), I knew this was not a normal aircraft.. It was shaped like a boomerang with the two lights on the front end of it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I know that aircraft fitted with large landing lights have them on the wings just out from the main fuselage but it was not like this.  I couldn’t make out a nose cone or any kind of body behind the wing shape.  Ok, there are aircraft similar to this and I have seen them.  I grew up by a military aircraft manufacturing plant and have seen many many planes.  Regular design, alpha wing, reverse wing, old and new but this was not like any that I remember.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As it got closer I realized that it was going to go almost right over the top of me and it did... well maybe just a little ahead because I watched it through my windscreen.  It was huge and like I say seemed to be really low to the ground... a couple of hundred feet at most.  When I say huge, I have seen and been really close and on a 747 and also a concord and it seemed to be bigger than this.  It was way too low to be just flying around and why have your landing lights on if you’re not landing because there is no airfield close enough for something that big to land around there except for Grissom and that is way south.  As it flew over me I was expecting a lot of noise but nothing...<n> <n><n> <n><n> I tried to follow its path but as I took my eyes off it and pulled back my sun visor to the sun roof and be able to see it and then out of my side window..  It was gone..  I scanned around and nothing...  No lights, no shape, nothing. There were no other vehicles around, nothing in front except for one way of in the distance but I could not see anything behind me.  Crap... why is it always that way.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have no idea what it was.  Was it a plane that either I could not make out because it was dark but if so, why no coloured lights on it…  Or a strange design that I have not seen before...  Maybe it was Stealth tech because they are an odd shape.  A Vulcan bomber, they have the delta wing shape, or something else.<n> <n><n> <n><n> No I did not get abducted,  ((Passage deleted))  I have not had any strange antenna popping out of it.  What did I see, no idea so by definition it was a UFO.<n>

The sky was free of clouds.  When it accelerated, it did so smoothly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The color of the light was blue, but more white towards the center, and it was circular in shape.

4/16/14 21:00|Seal Beach|CA|Unknown|25 seconds|Orange/red orb closely followed by F/A-18 Hornet at high rate of speed from south to north in Seal Beach, Ca.|4/18/14|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/108/S108714.html|300|ndxe201404| Orange/red orb closely followed by F/A-18 Hornet at high rate of speed from south to north in Seal Beach, Ca.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was driving eastbound on Westminster Blvd approaching Seal Beach Blvd when I observed two craft traveling at a high rate of speed in a south to north direction over the Seal Beach Naval Weapons Station.  The first object was a bright orange/red orb that stayed a consistent brightness and did not have any of the FAA required strobe lights or any perceived shape other than being a bright orb of light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The second object i could identify and was an F/A-18 Hornet.  Living in the flight path of Los Alamitos Air Force base, I know exactly what an F/A-18 sounds like, as well as where its strobes are located as opposed to the similar sounding F-16 which hardly ever uses this Los Alamitos Air Force base which is in their direction of travel, which I&#39;d estimate being 4 miles away.  But due to the speed of travel and how they were not on a flight path I&#39;ve ever seen used, I&#39;m guessing that the F/A-18 was either chasing the UFO or they were traveling together to a location further inland.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;d also like to add that the ufo was FAR brighter than the strobes on the jet, like comparing a candle to a mag-light.  I&#39;ve seen a similar orb if light about two years ago hovering over the Long Beach Airport, as did thousands of other Long Beach residents.  That incident is well documented and was even featured on UFO Hunters on History Channel.  Likely the same object or another of the same type.<n>

Duration: a few seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 4/16/2014, my wife and I were driving northeast on AZ 77 approximately 1/2 mi northeast of the intersection with AZ 79 in the town of Oracle.  Writer observed 4 or 5 round shaped, orange-tinted lights in the sky, approximately 30 degrees above the horizon, in an easterly direction from our position.  At first, they appeared to possibly be some type of aircraft flying in formation, four across, covering an area of sky equal to approximately one fist held at arm&#39;s length.  The lights appeared at first to be stationary and about the size of aircraft landing lights. There were no other visible aircraft running lights.  I pointed them  out to my wife.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then, the four or possibly five lights, split off from formation, appearing to go upward, then disappeared.  I hate to make this comparison, but they looked very much like the preliminary aircraft first shown in the movie Close Encounters of the Third Kind, kind of streaking off in different directions.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I opened my moonroof, hoping to hear the sound of jet engines or something that might help identify the lights, but there was only silence.  As for distance from my vehicle, if I were forced to guess I would say the lights were within a few miles, but as you know it is difficult to estimate such things.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At this time, the sky was clear.  Temperature approximately 75 degrees F. at ground level.  Low humidity.  No moonlight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Upon arriving home I called the county sheriff&#39;s office to inquire if they had received calls about the lights.  The told me &#34;no&#34;, and transferred my call to your person at ufo center.<n>

4/16/14 20:20|Las Vegas|NV|Unknown|5 minutes|UFO Captured Over North Las Vegas.|5/8/14|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/109/S109114.html|303|ndxe201404| UFO Captured Over North Las Vegas.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Something that I initially thought was an airplane flew north going right past my house, but it wasn&#39;t making any noise and the red lights were a brilliant red and seemed larger than normal.  Within a couple of seconds it reversed direction for about a second or two right in its own path and then reversed again continuing on towards North Las Vegas and perhaps even Nellis Air Force Base.  That got me up and onto a raised cement slab near our fence so I could see better.  I was pretty pumped and shocked at the same time because it was clear right away that this was a UFO.  When you see it in 3D with your own eyes it looks much clearer and way easier to see than any video will show.  My adrenalin was definitely running.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Anyway, I was fumbling around, trying to get my camera out of my pocket so I could try to film this thing.  By this time 45 seconds or more before has elapsed before I could start filming.  Being the novice I am, I used the screen on the phone camera to try and keep up with it.  I think that was a mistake because I kept losing the UFO, especially when it would dim in brightness.  I also zoomed in and out too much trying to see it better. I apologize for being so shaky but this might be a once in a lifetime event for me and I wanted proof.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So anyway, the video speaks for itself and I welcome any comments or criticisms.  Whatever it was it was amazing!  I see a lot of aircraft living where I live including Air Force One when Obama comes to town but I have never seen something like this putting on a show like it did.  It also had to be moving pretty fast because it was at least 10 miles away and could be close to 20 miles away depending on where it was at times in the video.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I also reported this to MUFON, case 55529.  I have already been contacted by the Regional Director (Nevada) for MUFON and told that it is being investigated.  The video I shot can be seen on YouTube at:<n> <n><n> <n><n> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ber6A4y2Fsc<n>

UFO  had very bright red and green lights  that were  pulsating.  UFO stayed motionless for at least 5 minutes, gradually moved down to the horizon till building (2 story High School) blocked our view.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Lost sight of UFO until it rose above the building , once again it stood still in the sky.While it was in the sky a plane from the west came close to the object.  The Philadelphia international airport is only about 6 miles to the west of our location.  I assume the plane may have been a commercial plane.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Suddenly UFO moved quickly across the sky heading southeast ,came to a stop then slowly moved back till once again it dropped out of view behind High School across the street.<n> <n><n> <n><n> All of us could not believe what we just saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((ADDENDUM FROM WITNESS))<n> <n><n> <n><n> I reported a sighting on the night of the 16th to your website.  The next day I started to review videos that were taken using iPhones.  On two of the videos taken, one 9 second long and another that was 48 sec. long, it appears to be another object moving about the UFO I reported.  I did not notice till I watched the videos,that there was another craft.  During the video the craft moves around the reported UFO, which at one point the UFO brightens as the smaller craft seemed to be right next to it.  As this was going on a commercial plane was coming from the west, as it neared the UFO&#39;s vicinity,the small craft swooped towards the plane and looks like it almost touches the plane The plane probably just took off from the Philadelphia airport.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Sincerely,  ((name deleted))<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((END ADDENDUM))<n>

When I got out of car with my cell phone I then only realized it wasn’t a boat but these large round orbs coming up from the water.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was so nervous as the first two came towards me and went right over the mountains heading north east.  The other seven orbs made a straight line right up the coast. I was so nervous my hands were shaking.  These orbs seemed to change in size and color after coming up out of the water.  I was hoping to zoom in but my phone doesn’t allow that.  I’m sorry the video is so shaky.  I have seen many sightings living over the beach in Malibu...this was the first time I was able to record it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am standing on Latigo road recording this which is about a half-mile from the beach, these orbs were very bright and large.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am hoping you can have experts look at what I have and give an explanation to what I had seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thank you.<n>

The time was 9:38 PM when I saw the objects (sunset time on day of occurrence:<n> <n><n> <n><n> 8:12 PM)  I was driving due west down Main Street in Oakley, Idaho, when is saw an orange-red light with a trail following it.  The object looked like a flare shot from a flare gun, but this is implausible as there is no civilization in the vicinity of the sighting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I at first mistook it for a planet, perhaps Mars due to the coloration.  It had a similar size and radiance to a bright star.  The trail vanished very quickly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object was roughly 15 degrees above my eye level, and it rose perfectly vertically, then stopped and hovered, from my perspective, about an inch above the horizon, for 3-4 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After which it faded out without moving.  (While the object was close to the horizon it was unmistakably above the horizon.) 	I exclaimed and alerted my sister, who was riding in the passenger seat.  She looked in time to see an identical object, in the exact same position as the first, rising to the exact same height as the first, fading out to black without moving just as the first had.<n> <n><n> <n><n> While the object was still visible, another object appeared, slightly higher, about 8 inches to the right.  They both faded out, in the same order in which they had appeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I quickly stopped the car and started the video camera on my smartphone, I videoed for a few minutes but nothing more appeared. I immediately called the UFO hotline, and spoke with the man who answered, while driving west-northwest. We kept a steady eye on the western horizon for the duration of the 9 mile drive home, but no more objects appeared.<n>

4/15/14 19:30|Lordsburg|NM|Cylinder|15 minutes|A large stationary craft in the southern skies of New Mexico.|4/18/14|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/108/S108672.html|326|ndxe201404| A large stationary craft in the southern skies of New Mexico.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;m a 24 year old truck-driver, familiar with Aircraft and Military planes.  While driving I often look to the sky and try to identify passing air-crafts.  Today, while driving I-10 eastbound in New Mexico and talking to my sister on the phone, I sighted in the southern sky approximately 10,000 to 20,000 ft (altitude)  a large craft comparable to a Boeing 747, hovering in  a stationary point in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It appeared to be metallic with no Navigation lights or wings.  At first it appeared to be cylindrical, I stopped at an exit ramp to take pictures, but my phone was unable to zoom in far enough to take an accurate picture.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I preceded on down the highway, still watching said craft as it stayed stationary.  I then preceded to contact my uncle, an Aeronautical Engineer, to try and ascertain the identity of the craft.  When we could not conclude on the identity of the craft, he gave me the hotline number for The National UFO Reporting Center.  I then reported my sighting on the hotline number, all the while, still observing the craft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It had remained stationary yet it had now become silhouetted and appeared to have two separate parts of nearly equal size.  This entire episode lasted about 15-18 minutes.  The craft never moved, yet eventually I could no longer see it out the passenger window of my truck.<n>

The object’s shape was a half moon and was huge.  Its wing span was from the top star of Orion’s belt to the bottom star.  It was approximately 30000ft altitude.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We are situated in between two airports and constantly see planes flying over the night sky and this object was unlike any we have seen.  We have a full view of the night sky and this object moved from one end of the sky to the other in a matter of 20 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object was not an orb or shiny or had any lights on, this is why it was not a plane. The object seemed to camouflage itself to the night sky.  It was like you could see through it but had some sort of structure to it because we could see the shape of a half moon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It looked like a cloud but there was no clouds at the time and it was to solid but clouds break up when they move and this object was really moving fast and clouds do not keep their structure like that when moving.  It was weird, like seeing something from a Star Trek movie were they have a cloaking device on the plane.<n> <n><n> <n><n> No sound was coming from the object and some planes past over the same position later that evening and you could hear the planes.  You could fit 10, 747 planes in this object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I know what I saw and it was not a plane, swamp gas, clouds some natural phenomena or a drone (drones are not that huge).  This object flew across the night sky and made a turn at the end of the other horizon.  Nothing man made can move from one end of the sky to the other so quick.<n>

I yelled out,&#34;what was that&#34;?<n> <n><n> <n><n> My 10 yr old daughter went out on the front porch and came back in and told me she didn&#39;t see anything.  Less than a minute later the sound goes over us again.  I looked out the small window in our kitchen and saw the trees swaying and just assumed it was the wind picking up and echoing in the mountains.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The 3rd time we hear it, I go out on the porch. It sounded like it was right above us but I saw nothing.  The sound was a deep rumbling and I couldn&#39;t tell what direction it was coming from.  The sound changed from a deep rumble to a higher pitch rumble.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then I saw the craft come over our house, at what seemed to be the same altitude as a normal aircraft.  This craft however, was wingless and a dark grayish color.  Also, it was sort of egg shaped.  Not exactly like an egg, but it wasn&#39;t round either.  This thing moved f! ast like a jet but left no jet stream.  Right when I saw it, I yelled out for my family to come see. In a matter of seconds it was already almost out of sight.  I know how this sounds, but I cannot deny what I saw. I don&#39;t know if it was alien or government.  What I do know is, it was not a normal plane or jet.  I hope I&#39;m not the only one to see this craft.<n>

Colors were white, green, and red and were alternating colors in no particular order or rhythm.  Objects were low flying and fairly slow, and no sound.  Neighborhood dogs were barking, uncharacteristically.  The lights moved from view in our backyard over our house, so moved to the front yard where they could continue to be seen.  Ran inside to get a camera and were gone when returned.<n>

My six year old called a shooting star.  My wife knew it was neither airplane nor helicopter it was so fast and silent.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We pulled over and watched it cross the entire valley towards the 405 interchange in a matter of seconds and vanish as it blended with the lights of the city.  I saw an amber glow, my wife and son believed to have a more blue/white color.  I am color blind and may have a different perception of color.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Simple math tells me this object was travelling at least 500 MPH maybe over a 1,000 MPH and no more than a 1,000 feet above the ground.<n>

I awoke and went to the bathroom.  I decided to reset my alarm on my phone for an additional 15 mins of sleep.  As I was doing this standing next to my bed a bright light caught my attention out the window next to the bed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I pulled the shade further aside to get a better view and was struck by the odd apparently flaming object at a seemingly low altitude traveling from the south heading basically northward.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Since I had my phone in my hand I quickly was able to turn on the camera and take 3 pictures.  The pictures are at quite a distance and the screen in the window added reticulation to the images but it is clear there are no red, green or landing lights like might be on a low flying plane (I work close to the regional airport and usually arrive at work in the dark and I am accustomed to what a plane leaving or arriving at a fairly low altitude looks like in many varying weather conditions) and it appeared elongated in the direction of travel and appeared to be emanating flames in all directions.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Though we were experiencing a lunar eclipse atthis same time, the moon was in another direction and there were only spotty clouds and none in the area of the sighted object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Also no sound was noticed.<n>

On Tuesday, April 15, at around 3:40 A.M., as I was just about to open my car door and get in, I suddenly got the thought to &#34;look up&#34;.  I did look up directly at a very bright light in the northwestern sky.  It was bigger and brighter than any star or planet I have ever seen.  As I watched, I noticed it was moving slowly due north.  It remained bright for only a few seconds and rapidly faded to a very small and dim dot that continued north.  I watched it for maybe ten seconds, and then got in my car and proceeded to work.  I have to admit I was a little shaken by the experience because of my sudden impulse and thought to look up.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is not the first object I have seen and I have made quite a few reports here.  I seem to see things like this quite often, not really sure why.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I don&#39;t know what it was, but it was this single bright white light, MUCH larger and brighter than any star or planet I have ever seen.  I did not see any red or green directional lights as aircraft have.  I could not tell how high it was, but I got the impression it was very high up in the sky, maybe 30-40,000 feet or so.  It was difficult to judge the speed as well, but it moved about the speed an airliner would move at high altitude.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have seen aircraft high in the sky light up when they reflect the sun, but this was a full 3 hours before sunrise, so I do not believe that is what I saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Anyway, that is it, it was a very simple and short sighting, but it did shake me up for awhile that morning.<n>

They began to flash back and forth, in a seemingly inconsistent pattern.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The flashing was not like that of a commercial aircraft&#39;s blinking, but rather a smooth transition from dim to bright.  They were exactly the same color as a bright blue star.  One light would make a short flash, and then another would a few seconds later, but the pattern was extremely irregular.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object then began to move across the sky toward the right of the Big Dipper and increased and slowed in speed.  I tracked it with my telescope until it made a turn and headed over my roof, where it then disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Although it was too dark to make out a shape, I may have seen some thin wings. I couldn&#39;t make out the rest of the fuselage, however.  It was also completely silent.  I don&#39;t know whether or not the motionlessness was wind, true hovering or an optical illusion.<n>

Then, one of the lights flickered to nothing while the second light remained lit and descended even faster before disappearing into the northern horizon.  All of the sudden, my oldest daughter saw both lights (Still blinking) reappear in western sky within a minute after vanishing.  Then the two blinking lights slowly moved to the east above us, pausing for brief moments, only to continue moving eastward.  The blinking was very irregular, sometimes they remained lit (like to blend in with the stars), other times like a strobe, and blinking steadily as well. The lights seemed to remain right over us for sometime.  My oldest and I played a game with the lights (joking that we should try to communicate with whatever it was) as they moved right above us using our flashlight&#39;s strobe setting.  It was crazy as they were mimicking our own light pattern.  Eventually the lights moved closer together and further east as they finally faded out in the eastern sky?  I thought about weather balloons, planes, helicopters, satellites, but none of these would have that kind of activity! I even had my oldest daughter to confirm these lights, just before the vanished, then she found them in the western sky!<n>

You really had to look hard to see it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first I thought it was a huge bird but it got closer and you could tell it wasn&#39;t an animal.  It was black and blended into sky, and had white lights or dots on it but they weren&#39;t very bright.  It silently and slowly went right over the house.  It seemed like it was very close.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We paused for a moment because we thought maybe someone was flying a kite.  I went around the house to see where it went but I couldn&#39;t see it.  It didn&#39;t seem like anyone was flying a kite nearby.  It was a clear night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My friend and I are 22, and we&#39;ve known each other all our lives.  I am very skeptical, I don&#39;t know if it is likely that this was some sort of alien thing but I think its fun to entertain the idea.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My friend is more skeptical than I am and she and I were both a little weirded out by the experience.  I feel a little shaken up by it, and I wanted to tell the story because I just wanted it to be on record somewhere.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Denver is just not a place I ever expected to see a UFO, especially in a residential area.

It seemed to be about the size of a house, triangular In shape - altitude approx. 500 feet.  No lights except the moon reflecting somewhat off of it.  Very strange! I&#39;m still shaken!

As I stated in my report it seemed to be about the size of a house.  If it was to fly in front of the moon at the time it would have easily covered it.  It made no noise and that is what was unusual and it spooked me. It also had no lights of any kind...just like a shadow in the air.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I observed it for 15 - 30 seconds and as it went over my house towards Mt.

We stood next to the base of a one story building, which took up two-thirds of the view of the southern sky.  The eclipse took place a few degrees above the tiles of the roof, and just a few degrees below a cable tv wire.  The objects streaked through this view within these narrow sky boundaries.  They moved in a 10:00 o&#39;clock to 4 o&#39;clock path at a rate of speed fast enough to span this space in just a few seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I began tracking the one on the left, which seemed slightly brighter while it also trailed one that I only barely perceived that was almost immediately below the line of sight due to the roof. I was able to view it for only 3 seconds before it too was blocked by the roof.  It took place as the haze of the marine cloud layer was passing over the city, and the haze was backlit somewhat by the moon making the observation attempts by my friends very challenging in the brief moment they had to respond to me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I immediately tried to understand what the two lights were since they were not flying in a straight line despite having a velocity similar to shooting stars.  The precise movement of the lead one on the right couldn&#39;t be observed but I clearly saw the one on the left have subtle shifts and wobble-like movements as it rapidly traversed my line of sight and miles of the sky in those short moments.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

I believe the moon had just been fully eclipsed only a minute or so when I noticed a strange moving object in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The first thought I had was, “why is that plane flying with out any lights on?”  Then, I immediately noticed it wasn’t a plane. It looked to me like a cylinder perhaps 30 feet in length and maybe 8 feet in diameter.  This dimensional estimate is based on a guess I have made after reflecting on what altitude I believed the object to be flying at.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It appeared to me to be flying at the cloud level which I estimated to be perhaps 5000 feet higher than the private planes I observed flying over the city in the southern sky. Those planes were at a typical 5000 foot level.  So I am estimating the objects altitude at between 8000 and 10000 feet.  The city lights are the only thing that illuminated the object. In the dim illumination the surface of the object looked off white in color.  It was flying in a direction perpendicular to the length of the cylinder shape.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I also noticed that it was traveling at a rate of speed many times faster than any man made aircraft can fly.  It was traveling in a North West direction, approximately 3 degrees lower than the angle of the moon in the sky. It disappeared from view within about 8 seconds. I looked around my neighborhood to see if anyone else was outside watching the eclipse, and there was no one for me to inquire with as to if they had seen the same object as I.<n>

I took many pictures starting when the moon was full to when the moon was eclipsed.  The lights only appeared at the beginning when the moon was full.  I took the first picture of the full moon then went to take another picture with my digital camera zoomed in and noticed a white circle coming towards the moon on the left side of my picture.  I thought that was weird so i took a picture.  The next time minutes later i zoomed in and noticed that the white circle was moving up down right to left so i took another picture.  After this i noticed a second white circle light come in to my picture , while looking at the moon thru my camera, so i took a picture.  I have at least 5 to 6 pictures with up to 3 unknown lights to the left of the moon and bottom of the moon.  As i went thru my pictures after i notice to the right side and top there was a weird round thing that looked like a pl! anet, but it did not stay in the same spot.  The moon was still at the full moon stage to slight full.  This all happened with in the first 30 minutes.  I did change location for my pictures to the deck.  I did not see anything after the moon started eclipsing.  I showed a few people the pictures, like my 2 boys and a couple of people at work, of course they are skeptics.  I have never seen an unidetified light before, but while looking at the moon with out the camera, there was a light to the right top side of the moon that moved a little from left to right.  Not a plane.  I have seen pictures of other peoples sightenings and have been recently interested in this.  I did see that vancouver washington has had sightenings, I dont know if this is one or not.  But i am fascinated.<n> <n><n> <n><n> PS:  while looking into my camera while it was zoomed in to the moons view i witnessed the white objects come into my view , which means there were moving not a light from the moon.<n>
4/14/14 23:00|Burlington|WA|Formation||3 metallic ovals in triangle formation moving at rapid pace spotted flying low over Burlington, WA.|4/18/14|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/108/S108647.html|349|ndxe201404| 3 metallic ovals in triangle formation moving at rapid pace spotted flying low over Burlington, WA.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On the night of Monday, April 14, 2014, my partner and I were outside on our deck at our home in Burlington,WA, hoping to watch the eclipse that was suppose to be happening soon.  Shortly after 23:00 hours we noticed off in the distance at about tree level, 3 objects that appeared to be slightly floating in a triangular formation.  They appeared to us at that 1st distance to resemble large mylar balloons perhaps.  They had a football or oval shape to them, and they glided in perfect formation, in what looked like a triangle at equal distances from each-other.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As the moonlight hit the objects we could tell they were certainly not balloons, and instead had a metallic surface on each of them.  The light reflected off of them similar to how sunlight/moonlight would off of a chrome bumper on a car or other metal object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After they looked like they were hovering for about 10 to 15 seconds, they began a slow rise for another few seconds and then immediately began flying, without any sound at all, at a very quick pace towards us, still up at the top of the trees around our area.  It took them less than 10 seconds to get directly overhead, as they passed us the oval on the left side of the triangle rotated underneath the center oval, and the right side oval rotated over the top so that both the outside objects switched sides within seconds.  The entire time there was still no noise, and once the objects switched sides all three began to climb rapidly up and move away from us to the EAST and then they simply disappeared from our vision.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We looked for several more minutes all around our area in the sky but couldn’t relocate these objects at all.  From the 1st second we spotted the triangle formation until we lost sight of them due to them either flying too fast for us or them simply disappearing, it was roughly 45 seconds to about a minute.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As for my partner and me, we both work in the retail management world in the Burlington area, we live quiet lives for the most part and just enjoy looking out at the stars, and spending evenings on our deck during the spring and summer months.  We thought it would be fun to catch the Eclipse last night, and instead it appears we caught something a bit more than that.  Exactly what it was, we are unsure but it certainly wasn’t like anything we’ve witnessed before.<n>

I put other under craft shape because all we could see was a line of lights but I felt like there was more to the object that we couldn&#39;t see.  The object didn&#39;t move that quickly but made turns and maneuvers that didn’t seem to be possible from conventional aircraft.  After a moment or two it was gone but we saw it again after a few minutes passed.  I have never considered myself much of a “believer” and I don’t know what I saw but I saw something.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I looked at them for a minute or two, and noticed they were flashing and moving slightly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I yelled for my daughter and husband to come see.  The outer lights were flashing periodically blue and white.  a few were flashing orange.  One flew through the sky flashing slowing with a bright white light-looked like lightning.  My husband said it was a plane, both me and my daughter said a plane does not flash that bright, nor fly that in that manner.  The lights were all above mountain-but looked like they were far away.  With the brightness of the moon the sky was brighter than I expected, more like early evening.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I honestly thought it look like those lights were an outline of something invisible, like a ship- or webbed together.  It also appeared that the webbing was becoming smokey clouds.  After twenty minutes or so they faded away and the sky  became darker than dark-again, even with the bright full moon.  We tried to video tape with my daughters IPAD, it just looked like blurry lights.  My husband looked through his binoculars and could see them flashing.  Makes you wonder if they are protecting us, watching us or if its our imagination.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Just very strange and I am not sure what to think as Im writing this I looked out the window a saw a flashing orange and white light go straight up then awkwardly continued upwards like wiggling.<n>

At first I didn&#39;t think about how long the lights were, I was too scared something was going to crash in front of me.  The lighted figure went back up slowly then completely disappeared.  I watched the sky waiting for it to reappear, but it never did.  The only clouds that were in the sky were too spread apart and thin for the figure to not be seen behind.  The lights were rectangular with the farthest left light being a long rectangle, the next light was a shorter rectangle and the last light was all the way to the right and was a square.  Airplanes are long front to back, this figure was long side to side. I watched the sky the whole rest of my drive and even when I got to my destination and the figure never reappeared.<n>

The first was solid.  The second was rapidly flashing.  The flashing light disappeared first, followed by the solid light about 1 second later.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The elevation of these lights was about 3 fingers up from the horizon with my arm fully extended.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About a minute later, and slightly more west  a single red light was seen by myself, my mother.  Again the duration was just a second or two.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The elevation of this light was that of a full closed hand at arms length.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Again about a minute later my father, mother and myself saw an orange light approximately 2 fingers in elevation.  This too was only for a second or two.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After  a couple of minutes, at an elevation of a full closed hand at arms, my parents, my wife and myself witnessed a  single red light become 2, then 3, then 4, and then 5 lights. They emerged out of the first light.  These lights stayed for just a couple of seconds and were gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This occurred from our perspective to be 200-220 degrees on the compass.

I was for some reason one of the only cars on this stretch of street on broward boulevard.  i was talking to my fiancé because i had just left a dinner meeting, and I noticed a lot of what seemed to be airplanes coming along the flight path going east to fort lauderdale airport.  as I continued on I began to realize that the 7 objects were not all airplanes, the airplanes had flashing strobe lights red, green and white but I noticed 4 objects that were  red/orange and what I will describe as orb shaped they were traveling along a formation for lack of a better word, two were on my right and they seemed to stop and stay still and to my left the other two which were a little further west started to catch up to the two standing still, I was sure at this point that these were not airplanes, the other two then crossed over broward boulevard and met the other two orbs! and formed a connect the dots square pattern and continued north east right over my car... I was really excited at this point and told my fiance to hang up and run outside our house and look in my general direction of where I was driving, I noticed the orbs were still going but the airplanes were so far behind, it was an amazing and frightening sight.I rushed home grabbed my fiance and we drove back to where I saw them but as I knew...they were no where to be found…<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke via telephone with this witness, and she sounded to us to be quite sincere, and sober-minded.

We live fairly close to the airport and so it is common for us to view jets flying over at different altitudes and coming and going in all directions.  I happened to look up and saw a few jets pretty far up and than this object caught my eye.   The object was not near the other jets. It was different than anything I have ever seen.  It was shaped similar to a barrel shape meaning top and bottom where more narrow than the mid-section.   It was flying vertical with the narrow points of the object one facing down to the earth the other facing up.  It looked like bright whitish metal and it was moving at an incredible speed.  I sat there and watched this bright white metal barrel thing fly faster than the jets and than just disappear into a pinpoint.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

My wife is a physician and it&#39;s not easy to get her shaken up.  She also has excellent observation skills and notices details that most people would miss.<n> <n><n> <n><n> She also did not believe in UFOs.  Today is her day off and she was at home.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A couple of hours ago, she called me (at work) in panic/excitement and said she observed a UFO when she stepped out of the house to get the dog.  From her words, she thought it was a plane that was sitting so low in the sky, she thought it was going to crash.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then she noticed it was too big for a plane, didn&#39;t have wings and was not making any noise.  She said that it looked like a rocket.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was moving slowly above the neighbor&#39;s house at a bird&#39;s flight height and she could see it was grey metallic (matte - not shiny, but the sun was out, it&#39;s been cloudy).  She saw the width of the machine, it was smooth overall, but had a large visible structure located towards the end of the body that looked like a propulsion system and some large symmetrical multiple tail type structure.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The machine was about twice the length of the plane and proportionally wider than the plane.  She was on the phone with her mother at the time, but could not turn on the camera on iPhone - it was not working.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The machine then made a slow turn without changing altitude and went beyond pine trees on neighbor&#39;s property, blocking her view.  By the time my wife went around the neighbor&#39;s house, the machine just vanished in the sky.  The dog never even looked up and didn&#39;t notice the vessel in the air as it was totally quiet.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This whole event lasted for about 20-30 sec&#39;s.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Our house backyard has a small lake and nearby is a undeveloped forested area ~5 Acres.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I can email the picture that my wife drew of the object..<n>

I wasn&#39;t sure what they were so I didn&#39;t say anything because I&#39;ve pointed out lights before suggesting they were UFO&#39;s and always ended up sounding stupid.  Anyways, the lights were there one second and gone the next, in the blink of an eye,without a trace. I know they weren&#39;t planes because the lights didn&#39;t blink and planes couldn&#39;t fly away so quickly on a seemingly cloudless night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

We both tried to pretend it didn&#39;t happen and hadn&#39;t seen much until Jan 2014.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In January 2014, I asked my neighbor if she had seen anything unusual in the sky, and without missing a beat she said, &#34;You see them to?&#34;  I was relieved that I wasn&#39;t going crazy.  At first it was 1 or 2 every now and then.  Since the first of March no it happens a lot and I&#39;m not sure if they are all together or its just huge.  I can shine a q-beam outside and its almost as if they swarm the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They change colors red, blue , orange, green, white so far. They move super fast with no noise what so ever. Its as if they illuminate the woods because some nights its as bright as dawn. I have taken pictures but if I let camera flash it will disappear.<n> <n><n> <n><n> One night I counted 8 of them on all sides of the property. Its very desolate here and I have called nasa with noone contacting me back. I am writing this report because this morning the dogs were barking uncontrolibly and I shined a light around the woods and after I shut the light off for about 5 minutes something shined a light back and flashed it 5-6 times.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Ever since Sept 2013 the electrical on my truck is haywire and every appliance in my home we are building has quit at some point.  I am not a beleiver of aliens but something is happening here and noone can answer it.  My animals bark at it and my deer camera even took pictures of one that was so low it was above the trees.<n>

I kept telling my son that he must it be confusing them for helicopters but he kept insisting they did not look like helicopters at all till April when I decided to walk the dog at night with my son that I discovered he was actually telling  the truth and these flying objects did not look like helicopters or air planes.   For one they make no sound, they are able to hover on top of the homes at a very very close range, they seemed to come out of a bigger a mean a much bigger space ships, the shapes of their lights change and they take off with such speed that it is almost impossible to see them take off till you go back and review the ! video and realized they took off so fast you were not able to see it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I also will like to share an experience, I sort of put it together in a video that I am also attaching.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am able to see vortex, I am able to see the energy they generate, when they open up, the beings that come out of the vortex which then turn into these sort of rotating flowers. I can also see the interconnection in the sky, they are like big flowers that interconnect and sort of like watching people and/or helping healing or I just do not know why there is these interconnections.   I have several videos of how the vortex open up, then it is like these flying beings that then turn into rotating flowers and begin to assist people in healing, all while the person is feeling the pulling things out of their bodies, or their bodies begin to shake, feel hot rod entering their bodies all while I am able to see with my own eyes what is it that they are pulling.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I see DNA and atoms around me and others, the DNA strands are usually at the end of the snakes that I see, they carry them at the end of their tail, some of the snakes are huge, I mean gigantic.  I can see the infinite space and the tunnels where these beings jump into sort of machines and enter the tunnels and then the tunnel closes.  I am able to see when someone is ill, when they have attachments, when they are full of light, I can see the energy field when emerges and the material no longer is solid as we know it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had a vision after one day experiencing so much pressure on my head that I was sore for about 2 weeks the first time I attempted to meditate, I was told “You are awaken” In the vision, I want to believe it was God as I am a Cristian believer, came down from a tunnel or vortex and handed me a white electric ball, the ball hanged on my hands, it retracted and expanded and stayed on my hands without me touching it.  I was told that I would be able to fight dark matter with it.  After that, I realized my hands contained such energy that I can invade other’s energy field and pull what is been affecting them, it could be illness, faces of beings attached to them.  At times the vortex opens up and the beings come out and begin to pull the things out of the person while I am watching everything they are doing, the person can not see it but they always feel it in their bodies for I would think it was all a part of an illusion on my part.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It is dark matter, when someone is ill, it is dark matter and the flying beings that turn into beautiful pink rotating flowers that surround the person begin to pull the matter.  I am able to also pull the dark matter with my own hands without ever touching the person or by just praying/meditating next to the person that is ill.  I am able to see attachments on people some of them have a silvery color, others are black with really ugly faces; However, I am also able to see people who are full of light and are surrounded by beautiful flowers, the colors are either pure white light, crystalline pink and sometimes light blue.  I am able to see the shape and faces of such attachments, the color of people auras and their flowers.  I am able to see when the vortex opens and the beings descend, then turn into these beautiful rotating flowers that then surround the person and begin to assist the person in pulling the dark matter.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I see sort of machines taking off and despairing into the abyss, while I have my eyes close, I can see everything that is happening, when these things are stubborn and refusing to leave and detach, which it is far more easy to bring them but really hard to get rid of them. I can direct the things that have infested the person to leave but is not that they are leaving this earth, I can see the infinite space full of stars, galaxies, then they enter these tunnels and the tunnel then closes. Sometimes these beings, as crazy as it might sound, I can see them jumping into these sort of things that look more like a machine space craft, or I am guessing they get tired and come and carry their stuff with them and take off.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The last experience I had was three weeks ago while I was taking a nap, I was woken up to hands on my back, I immediately felt I was sort of open on my back, then something from the middle was pull and as soon it was pull, it went into a tunnel.  Even thought I was sleeping on my stomach I was able to see the what they pull out of my body.  Then I felt hands pushing my back together, that is when I truly freaked out and jolted back.  There is an open vortex in my room, it is there all the time.  The beings come out specially if someone is in my room.  A friend visited me and began to read a bible passage and as soon as he began to read the scriptures, the beings came out, turned into these beautiful flowers and stood right next to him sort of hearing or seeing what he was doing.  I asked him if he could see them, he said no but he could sense them.<n>

They went in opposite directions and met every 5 seconds.  They were not perfectly round like a flashlight or searchlight would be.  At times, it seemed like a lively dance.  The full moon was still in the eastern sky and it was cloudy but the lights were very visible.  We went into the house after two hours.  I went out again at 4:30 a.m. and they were gone.<n>

There was overcast so there were no stars out. I noticed two orbs of light twinkling.  They seemed rather close so I took the next exit and worked my way back to them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As soon as they were visible I parked on the side of the road next to Scripps Memorial Hospital (never been in this area so it was the only landmark I noticed).  I watched them glide back and forth and decided to get a closer look.  At the intersection of Melba and San Dieguito I parked and the pure white lights were directly above me... not positive how high but not terribly high....  They gave off a solid color but would grow brighter...pulsing, never going dim.  After losing my nerve I retreated to the memorial parking lot where I watched them until they flew away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> These lights were not moving as an aircraft does, nor did they make a sound like a helicopter (or any sound for that matter).<n> <n><n> <n><n> After I couldn&#39;t see them from the parking lot I went back to the intersection amd got a glimpse of them going further out towards the ocean.  That was the last I saw of them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.  PD))<n>

It looked like a UFO craft,  So I started waving and it just continue to go down like if it was landing on earth.<n>

He said he saw something changing colors and going up and down.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We live close to the airport for about 14 years and we are used to airplanes, but the object was not like an airplane, it did not move as an airplane, did not sound like it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I went outside with him and I saw when it came up from behind the tree and it did not went up too high (lower than an airplane route). It was not too big, disk shape and the lights were underneath it.  The colors of the lights were green (like a traffic light).  The part where the lights were I could see rotating.  Not sure if the lights were turning off one after another or if the entire set of lights were rotating so fast that it gave me the impression that it was turning off in sequence. No sounds whatsoever.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It went down again and within a minute it went up again but now the lights were red (again like the red on the traffic light).<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object floated on air each time for about 30 seconds and went down.  We waited for a couple of minutes and we went inside.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We live near Gatlin and Semoran on Orlando, FL, and there is a park on Gatlin with lots of green space. I&#39;m thinking it was trying to lend there.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Fabulous experience.  I did not went back inside to get the camera cause I did not want to miss the appearance.<n>

All different colors and suddenly all the bright lights shut off and it turned to only a few orange and red lights around it.  And thats when it came so close that i seen the shape. It was spherical almost like a ball.  But it had legs coming from the botton . It just hovers. Its almost like it doesnt even fly it just sits up there in the sky. And by then my heart was racing i was looking for my phone.  But i didnt have it on me.  So i kept watching it, but i kept staring at the sky, and thats when my girlfriend cane , and i pointed it out and she can see it bright as day and she was amazed at how bright! and colorful it looked. not even two minutes later the clouds were blown away and i seen it, floating there stationary again.

(I thought nothing of it) until I got off the phone.  Left alone I looked in the sky and still saw this &#34;Orange Object&#34;.  (During this time I noticed no movement)<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then it began to move...  Slowly from left to right, in a straight line.  THEN STOPPED.  It stood stationary for approx. 60 seconds then...  Was gone (the lights went out).  I have lived near an airport (most of my life) so I know what planes look like in the sky, (also I know what &#34;higher-elevated&#34; planes look like), that night after &#34;It Went Dark&#34; a plane went by near the same location, (I was able to follow the plane through the mist across the entire sky) but still the original object was not seen)<n> <n><n> <n><n> After several minutes of going in and out of the house, I saw noting.  Then approx 10 min later, I went out... THERE IT WAS...  I called for m! y mother, brother and his girlfriend...  They then all witnessed the strange &#39;Orange-Light&#39; in the sky.  They witnessed this for approx. 1 to 2 minutes when it strangely &#39;went out&#39; (disappeared).  Then at right about 10:15 (standard time) I was inside laying on the couch watching TV.  When out of the corner of my eye, a light or movement caught my attention.  *****It was Orange and moving across the sky!*******(I can&#39;t bold that statement)  I ran outside; and saw it continue to move across our sky-line (albeit closer than before).  however, faster... Then AGAIN stopping.  Holding steady then the &#39;Orange-Light&#39; going out and the object disappearing.  My family (witnesses) &amp; can vouch, that there were no drugs or alcohol involved!

Once the last 3 disappeared, the clouds immediately moved out and the sky was crystal clear.  These lights had no sound, and there was no blinking lights on them even though we live close to the airport, there were no planes at the time landing or taking off at the time.<n>

I honestly thought I was just seeing things, but decided to grab my Ipad and record the following event:  Recorded via Ipad(although unfortunately, 10 times illegible versus the naked eye) I was noticing multiple reddish-orange orbs pulsating and maneuvering at odd trajectories.  They were lighting up the sky- many many many of them!  It was as though some of them would hover and some would skip in the sky.  Sometimes leaving visual traces of their flight paths…..<n> <n><n> <n><n> Some would hover, some would move in right angles and zip amongst the sky, some were pulsating, some were moving in what appeared to be in formation- sometimes forming distinct geometric patterns, some flashing in and out of focus, some turning slightly different colors- such as green-amber glows, etc.<n> <n><n> <n><n> That very night, the moon had a very peculiar glow and a mist or cloud formation that took on the shape of a beautiful circle of clouds or something equivalent.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Just so you know, I am an artist and an art professor at a respectable college, and my eyes are very keen to subtlety.  I honestly thought that most of what I was seeing was perhaps due to retinal fatigue, but when I went inside after the orange orbs, I decided to Ipad-video record this event.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I do not claim to see little green men.  I do not claim to have seen an ET.  I DO CLAIM THAT I SAW SOMETHING VERY VERY VERY PECULIAR AND VERY VERY ODD, THAT SEEMS TO BE AN INCREDIBLE VISUAL PHENOMANOM- whether it was natural or something else (even UFO like)  I have seen footage of Japanese/chinese lanterns, Aurora Borealis, flares, weather balloons, jets (as my father was in the military- I used to live in Fort Bragg, NC), drones, etc,..     and NONE OF THESE FIT THE BILL!!  I have no clue what I saw but am absolutely confounded and mystified what I had seen!!!!   Anyways, I hope that I am not crazy, or that I will NOT be publicly humiliated by these words, as I was honestly hesitant about sharing my experience.<n>

It was by far the brightest thing n the sky other than the moon.  The Saturday before that I had seen 3 of them just after sunset moving east to west.  I really didn&#39;t think much of it then until my brother witness the ones I saw on Saturday 12th.  My brother who is a pilot that flies a personal jet would know these kinda things, I looked at him and said what the hell is that?  He could give me an answer.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The first set there were 3 spaced out evenly pretty much moving in a line and followed by two more lights whHih were side by side each other moving in the same direction and about the same speed as the first 3 lights but at the last second the two objects (lights) crossed each other path.  It really freak me out.  The best thing of it all, I got that on video.  Think God now people won&#39;t think I&#39;m crazy.  And as for all the other lights I saw pretty much came n groups.  If you would like to see the video let me know I&#39;ll try and send it to ya.  Do you think these lights are to do with the gov. or are they UFO.  Please tell me what you think.

There are no street lights in this area so it was quite dark.  As I was facing east, there was a brilliant fluorescent green fireball that streaked in a downward arch toward the north.  I just saw it for a couple seconds before it went behind a neighbors large tree.  There are mountains that line most of my east view and it arched below the level of the mountain ridge.  I didn&#39;t see any sign of the fireball after it passed behind the tree.  It appeared to be some distance away (about 3 miles), but was quite large compared to the usual air traffic lights I&#39;ve seen in this area (all manner of private, commercial, and military planes and helicopters).  As it was only green, it did not resemble any aircraft light I have previously seen, both in configuration, size, or hue.  As I have been around military aircraft my whole life and am a pri! vate pilot I am quite familiar with the color and formation of running lights and this was in no way one I have ever seen before.  It is pretty quiet here as there are no major roads or traffic around here, especially at this time of night, so it was quite easy to observe that there was no associated sound with this.  Shortly after seeing this I saw and heard a couple firetrucks speeding in that direction although I don&#39;t know if that is where they ultimately were headed, especially since there are no roads that I know of that would have taken them to the area I saw the light.<n>

So I&#39;m walking around and I take a gander at the sky because it looked beautiful, and I see what looks like a little yellow light bouncing around.  Shorty after seeing the yellow one, I notice a blue one beneath it doing the same thing. just bouncing slightly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I mentally debate if what I&#39;m seeing if actually moving at all, and my vision is observing it wrong, then all of a sudden the blue one does a full circle in a split second, just WOOOSH!, then back to where it was like it just answered my question for me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At this point my jaw is at the floor, and Im just watching waiting for more. So I look at the 2 lights for a number of minutes, I&#39;m going to guess 5.  I felt like taking my eyes away from the sky would have been a mistake so I kept my eyes locked.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After a bit of time passes I see in the corner of my eye, a tubular long object with a light along it that looked like a flowing lightening bolt. It was emanating from the body of the object and flowing like a beam of electricity. On both ends there was bright flashing lights too. I see this objecting spinning in full circles and traveling extremely fast while its spinning.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So it comes from out of my vision to into my vision along the horizon, so it blows right past the other 2 hurdling by, absolutely blowing my mind, then it disappears for a split second, completely black, couldn&#39;t see it, then it reappears, and the lights on it are going completely insane and flashing up a storm and skipping from one area of the sky to another like it was literally teleporting across the sky in different places. it disappeared while it was on the left side of the sky, then reappeared on the right side, lights going absolutely crazy the whole time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It did that off into the distance till I couldn&#39;t see it any more. At this point I am completely rethinking my entire life and what I believe in. The 2 yellow and blue ones where still there, bouncing. Then I feel a bump on my back and it was my cat, and he sat there with me, and acted strange, like he knew to me. Like he was trying to comfort me, and help me be calm.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So I took some deep breaths and tried to call somebody to try make some sense of what just happened. Nobody took me seriously after calling 2 people. Feeling like I&#39;m wasting my time I go back outside. I look up and I see a star sized light to the naked eye. It is flashing back and forth between red and blue and white. Flashing pretty quickly. I cant believe my eyes so I go inside and grab my camera.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After mounting my tripod I zoomed in as far I could, and the object became allot larger in the camera. It was a perfect circle. Spinning in one direction flashing, then it changed the direction it was spinning. The color flashes weren&#39;t consistant at all and where at times getting really fast, then it would slow down, and it would be brighter white, the faster it spinned.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After being fixated on that one for nearly 45 minutes, the spinning tube one came back just spinning across the sky.  I managed to snap one picture of it, where you can see the beam of light that went along the whole thing. It came and went allot faster than the first time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I took pictures and videos of the spinning disc till my camera died. Hungry for more I go inside and charge my camera in hopes to get more footage because I felt like I couldn&#39;t get footage that was good enough.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Once my camera was charged I went back outside and it was covered in clouds and I couldn&#39;t see a thing. While I was inside I did allot of thinking and this sighting changed my life in many powerful ways. I felt blessed. I feel like a fool for not reporting sooner, I thought it would be smart to do it, then to let it go unheard.<n>

Due to the brilliance of the light which was not bright as to see your shadow, but more like a deep blue that did not look natural causing me to be a bit fearful.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At the time of the incident, two passenger jets were observed flying somewhat within the proximity of the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I live not to far from Newark airport so this is a heavily air trafficked area.

I heard a fighter plane type sound approaching us but didn&#39;t see anything.  About 3 seconds later I see a fighter plane coming from the west heading northeast. The fighter plane was traveling very low and very slow.  If I had to guess I would say 2,000 feet in altitude.  I told my son and my friend &#34;look it&#39;s a fighter plane&#34;.  We watched it for about 8 seconds as it flied by directly above us.  Then a large gray object approached the fighter plane from the rear at a very fast speed.  The object had no navigation lights like the fighter jet had. It only had 4 very dim bar lights between the main body and the wings.  I thought it was going to crash into the fighter plane.  It slowed down suddenly about 3 plane lengths away behind the fighter plane. It followed the plane for about 5 seconds.  Then the object gained speed, made a hard right, and then a hard left, cutting off the fighter plane.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object could be seen more clearly when it turned because it banked left. Then you could tell that the object was shaped like a stingray without a tail.  It was gray and about 12 times larger than the fighter plane. 4 dim bar lights on each side where the wings joined the main body.  The wings were not fixed.  The wings rippled at opposite rhythm like a stingray.  The object took off heading northwest very fast.  The fighter plane gained speed and continued northeast.  2 seconds later another fighter plane coming from the west followed the path as the first plane but traveled at a faster speed.<n>

Their color was an orange-yellow. At first, the lights appeared to be in a stationary line (like they were side by side).   The lights appeared to be over the golf course at the end of property.  There is cell phone tower to the left of the citing, a crop field behind it, and a rural neighborhood development to the right of it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I continued to stare at the lights, (2-3 minutes) they began to slowly move.  It became clear that the lights belonged to a single object that was rotating clockwise.  I judged the craft to be as big as my house (a 3,000 sq. ft. modified split-level) and as low in the sky as the tallest type of stadium lights.  As the craft moved, it rose higher in the sky and the lights began to intermittently, slowly dim and then brighten again, though they did not return to the same brilliance I had first seen when they were stationary in the row.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After the object turned, I got the impression that the object was triangular in shape and that the lights had appeared in a row before only because the craft was facing me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After watching it for several more minutes, only one light remained lit and it began to move off to the north until it was too far away for me to see anymore.  As it moved off in the distance it appeared to be about the height of the mature treetops it passed behind, and it seemed to be about ¾ the height of the cell phone tower it passed.  Of course, it could have been much higher in the sky than those estimates, and my perception could have been influenced by a distance perspective.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In total, approximately ten minutes passed from the time I first walked outside and noticed the lights to the time I watched the last lit light disappear.  I do not know what the object I observed was, I am certain that it was not an airplane or an astrological  ((sic.  astronomical?) phenomenon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to provide no contact information.

They were in the sky as high as a radio tower.  By this time I had stopped my vehicle on the highway, and we were almost right under them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My fiancé told me to shut off the radio, and that&#39;s when I heard a very faint constant ticking sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As these things moved slowly by us and were a distance (I know this area well, and I gauged their distance by the road I had previously come off of), of 3 miles, when all at once I saw what I can only describe as a single firework emitting 8-10 strands of light coming down, and then it happened again 5 seconds later.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After this I only saw one craft for about 10 seconds and then I saw nothing.  I just couldn&#39;t believe what I saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The whole experience lasted about 3 minutes.  These were no type of plane, or stealths, I&#39;ve seen both these aircrafts and these things in the sky that I saw were just massive in size compared to those.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As we continued to leave we saw a woman turn onto Highway 54 and stopped her and asked her if she saw what we saw, she explained that she had seen the light show and thought it was fireworks.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After reaching our destination (which was a casino) I began telling an employee what happened.  And I began to tell her about seeing something in the sky she stopped me and said, &#34;I saw the same thing, but only one craft&#34; (and it was one and a half hours after our experience).<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is my report, I stand true to what I say, and if they&#39;re out there, we have the right to know.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After seeing this there is no doubt in my mind that something else is out there.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke via telephone with this witness, and she seemed to us to be quite sincere, eloquent, and sober-minded.

When they were over us I looked through the sun roof and they looked totally different, like a huge dark gray triangle.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They sounded like an engine with bad lifters, just that constant ticking sound.  When they got just over us there was a silent explosion of what looked like yellow fireworks, and one of them was gone, then another silent explosion of yellow fireworks,  and I didn&#39;t see either of them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then off to the north there was another explosion of yellow fireworks.   After seeing the initial explosion I looked at the water to see if anything hit it, but there was nothing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Later that evening we talked to another lady, who said she saw one of the crafts, and her sister saw the same thing.<n>

As I looked closer, it was three white lights in a triangular form that appeared to be fallowing me, but never moved out of formation.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Since I had recently moved to the area I told myself I was just imagining it out of fear because I was driving down a dark country road.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Tonight (4/11/14) while driving home I seen the three bright lights again.  They hovered above the trees in the same formation as I had seen before.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I thought about all the possibilities of what it could be but nothing logical comes to mind.  There is not a home in that area and it there were the lights did not pulsate or the view of them did not get obstructed in any way as I traveled further down the road, lights from anything that would come from a home or even a person in the woods would have been blocked by the trees in this heavily wooded area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I said before these lights hovered directly above the trees (not way up in the sky) they also did not have a beam coming from them, more like 3 bright white orbs in a triangular formation that moves but does not break the formation.<n>

The first light was then followed by a 2nd which made me think I was looking at an aircraft route, but then there was a dance.  The front light shifted right and the the 2nd left.  When my manager came out I grabbed her.  She wasn&#39;t interested and I was going to be the weirdo pushing the subject.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Shortly thereafter the objects were joined by a third which made it more interesting because they seemed to form a triangle from my angle.

Looking from my car the size of the objects looked to be the size of an 18 wheeler flying around with red and blue lights flickering around the object.  I was astonished and scrambled to grab my phone to catch quick video footage.

I saw a point of light pretty high in there NE sky probably at a 45 degrees angle up.  It was stationary for some time, at least 5 minutes, but then I noticed slow movement towards the East.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After a minute or so it then seemed to descend somewhat in a southeasterly direction and was getting slightly larger which made me realize it was getting closer.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then it slowed and switched directions and headed north.  I noticed that it was very visible with polarized sunglass but barely visible without.  It started moving north and ascending in altitude.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At that point I got out of my car and approached someone leaving the diner and asked them if they could see it.  He could not see anything but I could see it with my polarized glasses.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I took two photos.  I deleted the first as I noticed my iPhone camera could not detect the object.  The second one I kept to bring home and see if could indeed pull it out with some enhan! cement.  I was able to actually see a faint point of light in the photograph.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object must have been highly reflective being that I couldn&#39;t spot it hardly at all until I viewed it through polarized lenses.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Eventually the object seemed to accelerate slight and slowly vanished out of sight heading due north.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I tried to call a friend on the north side of town to see if he could see it but he didn&#39;t answer.<n>

Two.  Saw them at 5:20 a.m.  From my vantage point in WLA, one was holding a fixed position roughly high above direction of Inglewood.  The second object was more NW, toward WLA.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Both were equally bright, appearing to be a row of lights with at least one below. Lights were white, with smaller green and amber lights..<n> <n><n> <n><n> Second one began moving west slowly, passed overhead without noise, then out of view.<n> <n><n> <n><n> First held its position from the time it was first visible, then gradually diminished in intensity, and then disappeared around 5:40 AM.  Lights went off.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I’m sure they will turn out to be nothing...just some crows with flashlights, pulling a fast one, perhaps.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Did not appear to be LAPD or media helicopters.  Lights did not flash, and there was no noise.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Report was submitted by a relative of the witness.  Both parties are journalists, and one of them is well known to us, and we deem him to be highly reliable.  PD))<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((ADDENDUM FROM WITNESS))<n> <n><n> <n><n> What we saw here in L.A.---which NO ONE else apparently reported---was totally, totally anomalous.  Completely strange, I’ve never seen anything like it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Two very very bright objects.  Hard to tell for sure, but it looked like three, maybe four very bright white lights in a row, with one or two underneath.  A half-cross.  Hints of red/amber from time to time.  It also appeared that the lights occasionally seemed to move slowly into different positions before going back to original formation.<n> <n><n> <n><n> One object remained stationary the whole time, roughly over Inglewood, very high (one would think, interfering with LAX flight path), and the other moved northwest slowly.  I figured it was a helicopter, but when it passed overhead (very high), there was zero noise.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((woman&#39;d name deleted)) is the last person to believe in this stuff, but she’s the one who spotted them and woke me up.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Black helicopters with soundless blades?  That’s the only remotely possible “logical” explanation I can come up with.  But the stationary one eventually diminished in intensity, then just went suddenly and entirely out.  What helicopter roughly in the flight path of LAX turns out its lights in total darkness?<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((END ADDENDUM))<n>

I also steadied my head against the door frame to see how much it was moving, id say it was about only 1/10th of my fist at arms length.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I woke my friend &amp; got her to look at it, was away for about about 20 seconds &amp; she came through to the kitchen to see it &amp; after maybe another 20 seconds of her watching it with me &amp; she did same with door frame to see it move she pointed out it was moving west slowly. (it did not seem to get closer at any point maybe a little further away even) &amp; near 04:50 we both saw a clean white flash &amp; 2 lights appeared but it was very fast to the west maybe 5 fists to the right/west of the 1st moving light it was at 20-25 degrees horizon &amp; seemed allot closer, (the flash looked to be 1 fist in size up/down &amp; half a fist diagonally across it not just a round flash) then maybe 1 to 1 &amp; a half fists to the left of the flash we saw a two lights red/green appear(no white light just 2 separate distinct colours, not flashing &amp; the red light was leading) they were moving FAST, maybe 3-4 fists a second from west to east within 5-7 seconds it was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The first one then moved slowly till about a 04:52~ it went behind an obstacle.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The first light was maybe at arms length the size of a match head.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The pair of solid red/green lights were about 2-3 times larger.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Tried to take a picture with my crappy Nokia but it could not see anything.<n> <n><n> <n><n> No sound of bang or anything.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There were no other planes i could see moving about, they fly over normally later in the morning &amp; make a shit load of noise I think a flight tracker for the UK would show if there were.<n>

I noticed what looked like a very bright star in the NE sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then I noticed red and green blinking lights every so often so then I thought it must be a plane.  This object never moved, however; just hung in the sky with intermittent blinking red and green lights ever so faint.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I watched this for about 15 minutes and this object moved very slightly left to right but usually settled back in its original spot.  I can only think satellite or weather balloon, but truly have no idea.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I blinked my eyes many times and looked away from this object to make sure I was not imagining anything.  Looking at the stars in the sky, they were much fainter and certainly did not have green and red lights flashing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I thought maybe it was an illusion of clouds dancing off the bright star, but the other stars did not have any clouds affecting them nearby, so that theory was shot.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Again, I do not know what it was and maybe it was a satellite or weather balloon, but I felt it worth reporting.<n>

I asked my wife to pull up a little closer so we could get a better look, and she did very frightenly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We sat there and watched this flying object over five minutes as it just stayed in one spot.  It seemed like whatever it was noticed us watching and started moving slowly away.

I was in the front yard of my house and saw movement in the sky toward the north of my house.  I observed 5 glowing yellow lights (almost like a flame, but not flickering) in a rectangular like formation.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I immediately ran into my house and told my wife and 2 daughters that were home to come outside to look at the lights.  We all went out our back door of the house and I pointed to the area of the lights.  They all saw the same thing I saw, but it looked as if the lights began traveling northbound slowly.  One of the 5 lights looked as if it merger into one of the other lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There were no sounds coming from the lights or anywhere else-other than the sound of neighbors talking (the sound travels in my backyard at night).<n> <n><n> <n><n> At one point, I saw what looked like flashing lights of a small aircraft (green and red flashing light) was traveling from the east to west in a path going toward the lights.  As the flashing lights reached the far right side of the lights, the flashing lights disappeared.  The flashing red &amp; green aircraft lights didn&#39;t change direction, didn&#39;t turn- they just disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My wife ran back into the house to grab a camera to see if it would show up in a picture, so she thought to quickly grab her iPad mini.  She took several pictures, of which a couple clearly showed the lights of the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After about 4-5 minutes, the lights appeared to continue traveling in a northern direction, then disappeared.  They object didn&#39;t make any sounds, but the lights just disappeared within a few seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We&#39;ve not contacted anyone,or,organization about what we saw, other than a few friends at church who thought we were crazy.  I even sent an email to a doctor friend of mine who is a novice astronomer.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am a retired police officer, former Air Force Sergeant, who has never before seen anything like what we saw than night.  While I do believe in UFO&#39;s, I&#39;ve never before seen anything that I would consider &#34;Unidentified&#34;.  No one in my family consumes alcohol or recreational drugs.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Please let me know if you would like any additional information or have any questions.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Sincerely,  XXXXX<n>

It is interesting because a husband and wife reported seeing the exact same thing my children reported on the same 4/10/14 date and time.  We do not know the couple at all.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My children saw the object from Baker Avenue in front of our house.  This is across town my many miles from the other report.  They reported that the sphere was orange in color.  It traveled at the speed of an airplane and it looked to be the same size as a full moon.  There was no sound.  They did know how high or far away it was.  They also said the sphere suddenly vanished.  I am making this report so that others that saw the same thing have the courage to come forward too.<n>

It mostly hovered, occasionally moving up and down, then side to side.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After ten minutes it flew straight to the left, then seemed to lower out of sight.  It disappeared for about 5 minutes then shot out straight up.  I waited, but it never reappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> While the ufo was visible their were about 3 to 4 airplanes in the same vicinity.  1 of the airplanes seemed to be very close to it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I managed a couple pictures, but they ended up blurring, although you can distinctly see the colors of the ufo.  Several of my neighbors watched the spacecraft from outside their homes.  After all of the excitement was over I pulled into my driveway.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As i exited my vehicle a car pulled over and honked.  Thinking it was my room mate i waved, it was not.

He repeated &#34;Do you believe in Jesus Christ?&#34;  I could tell he was getting agitated so i said yes.  He stared at me for a moment and then drove away.  I could not see his face, but i do not believe he was an &#34;entity&#34;, maybe just a man scared about what he had just seen.

At first I thought it was a large meteor that had entered the atmosphere.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I ran back into the house to call my roommate to see the large entail it had left in the sky.  When we went back into the back yard less than 30 seconds later, there were two bright red flashing objects flying from the point at which we could see the assumed meteor had hit.  One went to the right of us and behind a tree and the other flew to the left.  They both left white streaks in the sky originating from the exact place where the meteor trail hit the sky line.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We watched the object on the left as it flew across the sky and at first thought it must be a plane but there are no airports in that direction and it was moving extremely fast.  There was a solitary red blinking light and it left a perfectly straight white line in the sky.  When we stood on the bench in the back yard to get a better view of the lines in the sky we realized that the large object that had come down came from a point in the western sky.  The two red blinking objects left trails from exactly where the meteor would have hit and shot out of the impact site directly back to the exact same point in the sky that the larger object had come from.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We continued to look to the sky for the next 30 minutes without seeing anything further than the trails.  We tried to take pictures of the phenomenon but the ambient light was too bright to register anything on our phone cameras.  The trail from the large object continued to enlarge for another 30-40 minutes before dispersing. Upon writing this, I can still see faint white lines in the sky from the two objects that flew out of the area we thought the meteor hit.<n>

The light had a reddish rusty tinge to it.  It appeared to be slowly moving towards the west, in a steady motion.  After roughly 30 seconds of observation it immediately changed its direction.  I was very startled and got an immediate rush of fear.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This object then appeared to sway back and forth in a slow steady way.  I got the feeling I was being watched. This object then stopped movement for a good 5 min.  I ran inside to grab my phone to take a picture. I was inside for less than a min and when I returned I noticed the object had changed position.  The object was too far up to get any good pictures. I then noticed that there was three distinct edges that had very dim lighting on them.  By now this object was almost above me, there were two closely placed lights that seemed to be on the underside of the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had another strong rush of fear and feeling it knew it had been spotted.

It was an oval-like shape of light that did not pulsate or blink, but was was constant.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Soon I noticed a green object that was almost the same, but slightly smaller and flying behind the first one.  They moved quickly in their trajectory and &#34;popped&#34; in and out of sight several times, reappearing in various locations (some times the same and some times different locations).  Once, when an airplane flew over from N to S (crossing over my head), they both disappeared and then reappeared after the airplane was out of their range!<n> <n><n> <n><n> Lastly, after they thoroughly swept the sky NW to NE, they reversed direction, moving further from my vantage point towards the horizon.  They did this multiple times until they disappeared over the horizon.  The blue one, on occasion, would turn a light purple color and even a dark red.   Near their disappearance, I was able to get a good enough sight of the green one through my binoculars.  I noticed that it consisted of a green core (an orb like shape) surrounded by several smaller red orbs that glowed dimly in comparison.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The only &#34;strange&#34; appearance are several small black marks on my ankles.  This could, however, be ink from a pen, but for some odd reason I have not been able to remove these &#34;blots.&#34;<n>

We live in a new subdivision built by Mason Homes; the subdivision is now called Lakeside Village (Phase 2 of Penryn Village).  Before we were to turn left onto Strachan Street which leads to our street, I happened to look at the sky.  I saw a few stars, but then noticed one large, brightly lit object – which at first I thought must be a star or planet.  But I quickly realized that it was far too large and long and bright for it to be that kind of object.  Next, I assumed it must be a plane.  I pointed it out to my husband, who was driving.  Then I said, ‘Is that thing moving at all?  It seems to be staying in the same place.’  My husband wasn’t sure, either.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Just to clarify: We aren’t SURE of the shape of the object.  If we were seeing a side view of it, we would say it was cigar-shaped.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We stopped the car for less than a minute just to see if we could tell whether or not the object was moving.  It didn’t appear to be – but of course we told ourselves that planes often don’t seem to be moving IF they are flying AWAY from you.  We both commented on how big the item was – far larger than ANY plane we’d ever seen near Port Hope.  Port Hope is about 60 miles ENE from Toronto – and the only big planes we ever see are jets that are very high up and, therefore, don’t appear large.  This particular object was very bright, as I mentioned – a lot more well lit than any plane I have ever seen in the sky. It was either a huge thing or very close and low.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We began driving again, turning left onto Strachan Street.  Then, when we got to our new road, Maple Boulevard, we decided to stop once more.  We really wanted to find out IF the object was moving, as it seemed to stay in the exact spot we’d first seen it in – getting neither larger nor smaller.  I also wanted to open the window to find out if I could HEAR anything; we hadn’t heard any sound at this point.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When we stopped the car for the second time, I began to press the button to lower the window – and suddenly my husband said (just as I looked up to see the object), ‘It’s gone!’  We couldn’t believe it. It had disappeared in the SPLIT second that I took to reach for the window button.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We looked and looked, and drove around our housing development site to see if we could find the object somewhere else.  We never saw it again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Cathy Carlyle 	(Patrick Gray – my husband PS The lights looked yellow to me, but my husband felt they were yellowy-white.  In either case, they were extremely bright.  It was the stationery aspect of the object that caught my attention first, after I’d seen the object in front of me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We couldn’t tell if the thing was our over Lake Ontario or just over the land.  Our development is just off the shores of Lake Ontario, and the land swoops out a bit.  It was night and we couldn’t see precisely where this object was.  NOW we are at our cottage; when we go home next Thursday the 17th, we will drive along and look in an attempt to ascertain where the object was situated – if we can figure that out!<n>

We were staying right on the beach in the west end.  On Wednesday night, just after sundown, I went out to my balcony to watch the stars and smoke a cigarette.  I looked up and directly in front of my POV in the sky, which was the second floor of the hotel, was a bright, orange, glowing light like the color of Mars in the night sky.  First one, then multiple glowing “stars” appeared after about 30-45 minutes of the first one.  At first I thought it was a flare, but it was too big and didn’t arc and burn out and fall towards the gulf.  These lights would dim and then just disappear only to appear in a completely different spot from the previous one.  At one point, there was a glowing orange light to my left higher up in the sky and simultaneously one to my right slightly lower and seemed closer.  The one to the right split into 2 balls, and the one to my left split into 4 balls.  This happened several times.  The entire event l! asted about 4 hours.  Also, when the glowing orange “stars” would disappear, there would be blinking lights all around - sometimes one, other times 2-3.  They, too, would just disappear and then reappear somewhere else in the sky.  These “stars” didn’t move they just glowed and disappeared or multiplied then disappeared.  However, the last one of the night glowed brightly for about 15 minutes then split into two orange “stars” and started moving towards our building.  They turned into (?!?) flying vehicles with flashing red and white lights.  When they were overhead, they appeared to be boomerang shaped with the lights being on the bowed part which seemed to be the front of the vehicle.  There was no sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We also saw this same night, in between the glowing orange “star” show, a triangular (right triangle) formation of three stars.  Then a forth one appeared in between the two stars that were farthest apart, for example a right triangle with “A” being the point, “B” and “C” being the points of the right angle.  This “D” point appeared between stars “A” and “B”.  A few minutes later, my son pointed out that the fourth star or “D”, which was not twinkling, was moving.  We watched it slowly move north, and then speed up once it was at what appeared to be a right angle to the right triangle.  It eventually flew over our building.  This object was made of white light, had no sound, and was maybe just outside of our atmosphere or miles into the upper atmosphere.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The really strange thing is earlier that evening, just when the sun was above the horizon, I was sitting on the balcony watching seagulls attempting to catch their dinner when one of them flew straight up into the sky (very high) and then flew straight out towards the horizon.  Now there were no clouds in the sky and no fog.  I continued watching this bird as its behavior just seemed odd to me, until it flat disappeared in the middle of its flight to the horizon.  The first orange glowing “star” appeared where the seagull had disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I took several pictures, but unfortunately, they’re not so great as my phone’s camera is really poor quality.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Once the orange, glowing “stars” finished their “show”, we noticed about 30 minutes later a bright red light on the horizon actually on the water.  It was motionless for approximately 20-25 minutes.  All of a sudden, it took off across the horizon line at a tremendous speed.  It appeared to be hovering above the water.  I have grown up on the coast and have never seen anything that big move that fast.  The distance had to be at least 6-7 miles out and there was no sound.  It had red and white lights.  It got to a certain point coming all the way across the horizon line and disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Whatever we witnessed, along with several other guests at the hotel, was like nothing I’ve ever seen (and I’ve seen the space station and satellites.  None of these objects or activities was even similar to what I’ve witnessed before.)<n>

I looked down to see what my dog was getting herself into and retrained my eyes on the laser pointer.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I looked up I noticed a very bright light directly next to the laser pointer.

The light was just at cloud level and moving much too slow to be a aircraft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Each time the light got brighter it seemed to become more intense.

It appeared out of nowhere. In an instant, the ball of light dropped vertically downward at super speed, then was &#34;sucked up&#34; into what appeared to be clouds.  The clouds were parted in the area the ball of light entered, the clouds surrounding the immediate vicinity of the light were illuminated, there appeared to be no cloud movement.  The ball of light dimmed to where it could no longer be seen. I cant say how far the ball of light vertically dropped, but if you hold a ruler to the sky, it was probably about 5 inches.  The drop lasted 2 seconds.  The suck up and fade out lasted another 2 seconds. Definately not a shooting star because:  way too fast, trajectory of drop was straight down and didnt follow curvature of the earth similar to what shooting stars exhibit, was in front/below clouds and was sucked up into them.<n>

Each object consisted of 3 horizontal, white lights.  I didn&#39;t think much of it at first and continued to the end of the street and turned around.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I removed my ear buds and began walking back while observing the three objects.  The left-most object began to pulsate, fading completely out of sight and then fading back into full view.  As it faded in and out, I noticed that the fading seemed to be accompanied by a strange cloud formation around the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> All the while I heard NOTHING.  Being only a few miles from the Johnston County airport, we frequently see low flying aircraft, but these were completely void of any sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was completely awestruck and this point, standing in the middle of my neighborhood street in full-body goosebumps.  I then noticed that the objects weren&#39;t actually stationary and that they were moving VERY slowly to the south.  I looked down to grab my phone, fumbling, trying to get the camera ready for video and when I looked up, all three objects had vanished.  I scanned the sky for a minute or two and finally saw them drifting out of view heading south. It was one of the strangest and profound moments of my lifetime.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;m a 37 year old software engineer and private pilot.<n>

Object appeared to be close.  500ft-1000ft away, 100ft above ground.  15ft to 25ft in size.  Total time of sighting was less than 10 seconds.   Object passed behind nearby tree convincing me that this was not a visual artifact.  Object was very close and appeared solid.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I stepped to either side to test my eyes.  Doing this gave me a feel of where the object was.  This action completely validated that the object was indeed there and very close.  I had a fight or flight response with goose bumps.   Absolute linear direction and speed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first I thought it was a bundle of balloons.  Then an Owl.  Then a puff of smoke.  But it set in this was a large solid mass moving deliberately and silently.  It was just right there.  Very Close.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The leading edges were rounded and visible as a grey sweeping line with mass visible behind, but I was unable to determine shape.  Moving at perhaps 30 to 40 MPH.  There was no wind.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My view of the flight path was not obstructed, but the object became faint and disappeared.  This is my one and only “UFO” sighting.  My overall impression is that the object was close, big and silent.  Maybe someone else saw it.  I am ½  mile east of the Austin Samsung plant.<n>

It was dark at this time and I could hear jet engines just to the south of town, which is somewhat unusual in this very rural region of the country.  When I looked upward toward the engine noise I saw a reddish-orange object that at first glance appeared to be a normal aircraft.  It was flying toward the southwest in a straight line at an estimated altitude of about 20,000 feet.  There is a 10,000-foot mountain range in the same direction(immediately west of town) that allowed me to roughly gauge the altitude.<n> <n><n> <n><n> However, what was unusual about this craft, in my opinion, is that it was not blinking at all; there was no evidence of flashing navigation beacons.  The light was a steady reddish-orange color, but too distant to make out any other detail.  The other unusual aspect of this sighting is that the reddish-orange craft was being followed (perhaps escorted or pursued???) by three jet aircraft that wer! e equipped with normal bright blinking white navigation beacons.  The pursuit craft were approximately one mile behind the reddish-orange craft and appeared to maintain that separation distance until all craft eventually disappeared over the mountain range to the west (Chiricahua Mountains).<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am puzzled by the lack of blinking nav lights on the reddish-orange craft.  I am under the impression that blinking nav lights are required by the FAA on all aircraft, especially at night.<n>

Right after I turned I noticed some lights up in the sky to my left.  The lights were illuminating a just around the top edge of this craft.  I stopped and got out of my car to observe it better.<n> <n><n> <n><n> That&#39;s  when I could then see a silohuette of the object and realized this ufo had to be massive in size.  It had a shape of a mushroom cap just a little boxier and just below that it had rectangle shaped base.  There was a row of lights that ran from one side across the top and down the other side.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was at one point when crossing the bridge going toward Seven Points that it was over the water and lower in the sky when two beams of very pale blue extended almost to the water.

I live at the north-eastern edge of Frankfurt, with my appartment balcony facing south-west.  One evening, about a week ago, around 10pm, I was on my balcony, having a look at the night sky to see just how busy Frankfurt Intl was, as the 11pm – 5am Flight curfew approached.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I could see the lights of one aircraft to my right , heading south-west, which suggested that  r/w 07 was in use that night.  To just confirm that I looked to where I would expect departing aircraft to appear, as they departed r/w 07. There was no traffic … but I did notice something.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was a translucent &#39;shimmering&#39; in the night sky, oval in shape, and the same size as I would expect a departing jet would be.  It was travelling from (my) left to right, just as if it had made a left turnout from the aiport. It was like a ripple in the fabric of the night sky.  I could switch my gaze between both the downwind aircraft and the object (which looked as if it was heading directly for the aircraft, even at the same height) without any problem.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It passed well behind the commercial jet and I lost sight of the &#39;object&#39; as it passed to the west.  The whole &#39;sighting&#39; lasted around 2 minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have never seen anything like this before.  As it had a size and speed agreeing with commercial traffic in the night sky, I immediately thought of it being some sort of stealth aircraft .<n>

The objects were south and east from me and had a horizontal bar shape with a central area that was larger and brighter, and they were moving, bobbing horizontally and vertically about. I stood outside looking at them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then I noticed that one was descending, becoming brighter and more easily discerned, and I could see that it was actually ring shaped like a diamond eternity band with a central, larger diamond. It was descending quickly, and I hurried to my car.  I traveled west on Hwy 6 going toward the 218 north entrance and continued to see the three objects, studying them as they moved when stopped at each crossing light, fearful that I might become distracted and have an accident.  One remained lower and brighter than the other two, but they moved somewhat together.  Minutes later when initially driving north on 218, I saw only one to my north and west, but eventually I saw two, the brighter and lower one behind me while I drove.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The one to my left and in front of me appeared higher, and it was going in and out of the clouds, so sometimes I saw it and other times I did not.  Highway 218 north became Interstate 380 north.  When I finally got to Cedar Rapids, I thought they would rise and vanish.  As I got closer to my apartment building off Wilson Ave, however, I could see two, both higher and less brilliant in light.  Then when I parked my car outside my apartment building facing east, a very bright red ring shaped object was hovering low and east of my apartment building over a hill.  I sat inside my car and looked right at it while I was talking to my co-worker on the phone because I was frightened.  She pooh-poohs the existence of UFOs but stayed on the phone with me until I walked away from my car and was inside my apartment.  The time was a few minutes before 10:00 pm, I believe, and the NCAA ! men’s championship basketball game had a couple minutes left.  I can&#39;t take pictures with my phone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am re-entering this to clarify that I initially travelled on Highway 218 north which then becomes Interstate 380 north.<n>

The lights were not bright; i could only see the outlines of the wings and the lights.  The lights on the bottom resembled angel eyes on tuner cars, much like a BMW type style.  The craft was a bit covered by the haze, but could be clearly seen.  The craft also did not make a sound, and moved about 100-125 KTAS (knots true air speed) along.  Also, the aircraft did not move in line with an approach or departure from the airport, as would be a giveaway if it was an aircraft. It moved at around a 45 degree angle from runway 34 departu! re end, right over the airport.<n>

It was still dark.  At first I thought it might be a star, but as I drew closer I realized it could not be.  As I continued to travel along the freeway I was watching it and it did not appear to be moving.  I considered that perhaps it was a signal light on top of a cell phone tower or similar but I was not aware of any such construction in the area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I got closer and it came clearly into view, it appeared to be triangular in shape and the size of a large plane.  It seemed to hover and didn’t have any speed like an airplane or jet would.  There was also no audible sound coming from it.  Although I did not lower the windows on my vehicle, I feel sure that had it been a plane of that size I would have heard the roar of the engines.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The other thing that struck me as unusual was that it appeared to have search lights on it.  They were very big and round and they faced down, towards the ground, not like the head lights of an airplane.  It did also have a red and green light on it which I understand is used to signal port and starboard on aircraft. I am not sure how many of these search lights were on this triangle as I did not count them, but I would guess at perhaps 6 or 8.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was unable to stop on the freeway, or to take picture whilst I was driving so I took the off ramp and drove around to where I normally park, hoping I would still be able to see it, however by the time I got around the building, I could no longer see the craft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I would very much like to learn what it is that I saw.<n>

Unlike most aircraft you see, its movement was distinct in that its movement seemed so effortless - (there was no loss of speed during its turn, no change in altitude, no roll, banking or any of the other traditional characteristics of powered flight.)  Underneath it had several dull, faint glowing white lights that appeared to be inlaid on the bottom and illuminated the outline of the underbelly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I compared what I saw afterwards to several online videos of F117&#39;s and B2&#39;s in night flight.

It was very close to my house it looked as if it went into the woods right by my house.  The size was a little bigger than a basketball.  It was moving slowly enough that I watched it go into the woods by my house.  It was not moving fast and quick, just flowing down to the ground.  I went out on Sunday to look around the field by the woods and couldn&#39;t get close enough with the ranger because of the mud from all the rain we just got.  Just gave up looking because of the fields being so muddy, I didn’t want to walk either.  Just thought maybe it was a shooting star.  Until I Saw the news on the 16th of April (Channel 2 St Louis) and saw these blue balls that someone else saw thought maybe I should tell someone about what I saw that Saturday night around 10:20 pm.<n>

Approaching Bee Caves Road, I looked to the east over Zilker Park, and saw a series of red lights, most flying in a shallow &#34;U&#34; formation.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Two of the approximate seven to nine lights were out of formation.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The lights didn’t seem to be moving or moved very slowly while staying very near each other.  I’ve never seen aircraft fly so close together.  The number of lights caught my attention first and then the fact that they appeared so close together.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The lights glowed a solid red and never blinked, as aircraft lights do.<n> <n><n> <n><n> By the time we pulled into Zilker Park to watch, only three lights remained.  Slowly they blinked off one by one.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About fifty yards away a man stood outside his car, dancing and screaming.  When he saw us he yelled, “Did you see that?”<n> <n><n> <n><n> My husband and I hurried to meet him and he said he had watched the lights for about ten minutes.  We saw them for about three to four minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The stranger, our new friend, said they first appeared on the southern horizon.  We both watched them travel to the southwest.<n> <n><n> <n><n> He also said that twice he saw one light race to a second light and hover briefly before racing off at an unusually high rate of speed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My husband is sixty-seven and has practiced law for the last forty years.  I’m almost sixty, attended graduate school and was a stay-at-home mother.  Neither my husband nor I have ever seen anything like this.<n>

They were orange/yellow, very bright.  My daughter thought that they were hot air balloons or lanterns, and asked if you could release lanterns in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I looked over and saw them, but was unable to pull to the side of the road at that time as there was a car directly behind me.  At first I thought it may be a plane, as 2 of the lights seemed to be travelling together, and remained parallel and equal distance apart, similar to lights on a large plane.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I told her that it was a strange color but I was sure that it was a large plane from WPAFB as the lights were travelling together and appeared to be turning together.  Then the lights split.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Her phone would not video while we were moving.  I drove into a subdivision where we could stop and get out, by then there were 2 lights left to be seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We got a picture from her phone, then the lights were all gone.  They were not moving like a meteor of falling star.  Two were originally close to each other then split while the two others were farther away, but still all four were somewhat in a cluster.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have never seen lights in the sky move like this, or this color.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were unable to see a shape other than a round bright sphere, lights moving in unison and then separating, then disappearing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I might add my father was an Air Force pilot, and I have lived on or near bases my whole life.<n> <n><n> <n><n> But these lights did not act like meteors, or planes and they disappeared while in the sky.<n>

I would guess the approximate altitude of the objects ranged from 3000 to 5000 feet in elevation.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The glowing objects started to disappear from the sky one after another even though they were at a distance that should’ve been observable if it were a plane.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I got out of my vehicle to try and record them, but my phone camera couldn’t really capture the glowing objects due to the poor lighting conditions outside.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There were no blinking signals (such as those seen on aircrafts), and I didn’t hear any type of aircraft sound.  The objects were dead silent, and hovering and a constant speed which seemed to be moving much slower than typical airplanes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I pulled up to some police officers at a stop-light 10-15 minutes after the event, asked them if anyone had called in about “weird lights in the sky” and they said no.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Approximate duration of sighting was 4-5 minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is the first time I have ever witnessed anything like this.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A little background about me:  I’m a U.S. Navy veteran who has seen almost every type of aircraft there is to see during my time out at sea.

There is a Coast Guard Base about 50 miles away in North Carolina and helicopters fly to the Norfolk Naval Base.  We also have the Norfolk Internationl Air Port where commercial planes land and take off so I thought nothing of it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Later I looked at the object again and it was closer at about the same angle. I wondering why it was so bright then concluded it must have its landing lights on.  I could not see the red and green flashing lights on the wings and thought the landing lights were blocking them I turned and went back playing with my dogs.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There were other planes in the area I could see their flashing red and greenl lights on the wings.   Some were making their turn for Norfolk Airport and otheres heading towards other places. I looked again and the object made a slight course change rather quickly.  It was not a big move but was abrupt.  As I took my dogs back to the house I glanced again at the object and realized it was not a plane.  The total time I had been and outside playing with the dogs and watching this object was about 10 minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> While in the house I grabbed my Nikon 10x50 binocluars went out side and observed the object through the binocluars.  At this time it was at about an 80 degree angle almost directly over me, I had to lean against a post on my porch to steady the binocluars. It was bright white with a haze around the edges and in the shape of a circle.  I called my wife and asked her what she thought that was pointing to the object she replied a plane.  I handed the glasses to her she looked and said on my God.  Then she said it was gone. I grabbed the binocluars found the object whchi had moved in a North East direction very fast it was no a pin point of light orange in color and about 20 to 30 degress.  It got smaller appeared to go in to a haze then it was gone.  From the time I took the glasses and the object disappeared was from 5 to 10 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have thought about this and believe the object was above the Earths&#39; atmosphere. The bright white was a reflection off of the objects surface.  That would also explain why there was no sonic boom when the object sped away.  I now believe that the object did not change color to orange but as it sped away the atomsphere gave the impression the color change.  I have observed this when I look at a star in that direction that appears to be orange.  This object must have been massive.<n>

I am 100% certain it was not, its course was not a straight line but looked almost like it were a fire fly trying to fly straight the speed was eerily constant and slowish.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I watched the light come in from the SW, I continued to watch it until it was the the NE of me, where it seemed to slow down and turn a bland orange color, and proceeded to disappear completely.

As I followed it with my eyes, there seem to be three or more white circular lights rotating around in a circle (like on an orbit path).  I thought of searchlights, but didn’t see the typical stream of light.  I thought of a helicopter searchlight, but there seemed to be no aircraft nearby.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I drove on out of my neighborhood, I tried to identify where it may have come from.  I never figured it out.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Tonight, I googled a group of words, and found this website.  I read a listing for 4/3/2014 out in another city (I believe).  They have a similar listing.

I was walking in the door and glanced up in the sky to try and see if it looked like it was going to rain, a Black orb/oval shaped object caught my attention.  The object was flying across the sky horizontally towards the downtown area, the rate in which it was moving looked faster than any fighter jets that i have seen flying.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The back object was moving rather fast, however there was no sound or flashing lights like airplanes, jets or helicopters have.  As the object was moving towards the direction of the downtown area (10-15 miles from my workplace), it appeared to rotate mid-air resulting in looking more narrow and smaller than it did when i first noticed.  After a couple seconds in this narrow appearance it rotated again and was back to the first observed shape.<n> <n><n> <n><n> From the moment I initially saw the object until it was out of view lasted about 15-20 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There were clouds covering the sky, and I am no expert of the distance of things, but it was well below the cloud line.  My guess is this object had to be between 1,000 feet - 2,000 feet in the air.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I rushed inside work to tell my co-workers what I had seen only to get laughed at.  Within a minute of entering the building, my co-workers &amp; myself heard what sounded like 2 fighter jets flying overhead &amp; the sound of the jets was going in the same direction as the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I do not know what the black orb/oval was that I saw.  The object made  No sounds,  No lights and a fast velocity, which was shortly followed by some fighter jets.  I can only describe the object as a U.F.O,  I&#39;m not automatically assuming Extra Terrestrial, I just can&#39;t explain what the object was.<n>

The main body of it was between a circle and oval shape with a circle in the bottom of it which was outlined by the light blue color noted earlier, it also had on each side what I would describe as silver rounded off piece&#39;s that could only be described as looking like ancient style ax heads they were attached but not part of the main body.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I watch as it came over head and slowed down for a brief moment then continued on it path heading from South Southeast, towards North Northwest, then as I watched it started picking up some speed and then it was gone.<n>

He asked me if I could see them from my house, so I went outside and yes, I could see 2 of them for a short time.  One of them veered off into nothingness, and the other one seemed to climb higher and then vanished.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When they disappeared from view, I came back inside to find my binoculars.  Here is what I saw: With the binoculars I could see 3 more.  At first I wondered if they were some kind of a very large bird, but they seemed to be so high up that it didn’t seem logical.  They were extremely white and bright with straight wings, but the ends were flat with slightly rounded corners.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then, I wondered if it could be a piper cub plane, but it was so very high up, that did not make sense either.  They simply cruised, sometimes curving back like a bird of prey might do, and then other times they turned direction and came back in a straight line.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My total viewing time with the binoculars was approximately 20 minutes.  I also wondered if it was a fleet of drones.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I must stress that the most important aspects of this sighting are that they were extremely white, that they were extremely high up, and that the wings were not bird like at the tips, but straight out, flat at the ends, with slightly rounded tips.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thank you for your time and all the work you do.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  The witness has amended the time to approximately 14:30 hrs..

The location is Jefferson, Maine, about 20 miles east of Augusta.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am a frequent watcher of the sky, and as I gazed up at this time toward the north, I saw very high up (several miles) at maybe a 70 degree angle from ground level to directly overhead  two white objects that caught my attention.  They were drifting, rather than flying in a linear manner as any airplane would normally do.  The motion seemed to be analogous to a hawk or eagle looking for prey far below, or perhaps a hang glider.  However, these objects were apparently around the height of normal jet plane, way too high for birds.  They were not drifting with a wind current as they were constantly changing direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I watched for a few minutes and then went in to get binoculars. Upon locating them in the binoculars, I noticed color--orange, yellow, and green from from front to back respectively. I continued to watch for awhile then was about to put away the binoculars inside the house when I went out again and saw many more.  I was able to count 16 in all.  Every one was identical in size, shape and color.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After watching some more, I called a friend who also has a keen interest in UFO sightings.  She lives about a mile from me, also in Jefferson.  When she went out she could only see two, but only in white.<n> <n><n> <n><n> While she reported what she was seeing, I was inside on my land line phone with her.  Eventually, they disappeared into the haze of the thin clouds and we lost sight of them after about one half hour, seeming to be moving to the east from north.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What struck me was their apparent random motion with respect to each other and also in rather looping circular motion individually, again, much as one might see with hawks or eagles.  The shape was like a small fixed wing airplane.  No sound was heard nor anything resembling a jet contrail.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am a senior citizen in complete control of my mental capacity.  My friend is likely a bit younger, but over 50.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke via telephone with this witness, and he seemed quite serious and sober-minded to us.

It was traveling South to North, heading towards my location at a steady speed.  It was not windy out.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was a glowing red circle or orb, it did not emit smoke, it did not leave a tail.  I just stood watching it come closer and closer and was mesmerized by what it was so much so that I didn’t want to stop watching it to get my cell to take a video.  It made no sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was approx. one story above the one story houses.  At it’s closest point to me, approx. 30 feet from me, it appeared to be between the size of a basket ball to a 3 foot circle which means it would have been larger in person.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It went between my house and the neighbors house at a steady speed.  I ran to the North side of the house and watched it continue North, it had already appeared on the North side of the houses and was traveling faster than I ran.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I did not feel threatened by this object at this point in time.  It appeared to be a red swirling ball of glowing gaseous liquid, but it was traveling at a constant speed and at a constant distance above the earth.  It appeared to be searching for something, ! or perhaps observing stuff.  I watched it disappear out of sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was hoping to see others, so I grabbed my phone, used the bathroom, and turned off the house alarm so I could go outside if I saw another one.  I went back and forth from the North to the South sides of the house looking out the windows to see if there were others.  Then at about 11:03 pm, I saw what appeared to be the same red glowing orb traveling from the North back South along the same exact path.  I activated my cell phone video but it’s shaky and the object appeared so small on the video compared to what I saw with my eyes.  All of a sudden I got an eery feeling because it seemed to be coming right at me and slowing down.  I decided to go outside to see it I could get a better video of it.  At this point, I am concerned as to not only what it is, buy why is it heading back toward me? As I walk outside and hold my cell up the object started traveling North away from me again.  At this point I am spooked.  I didn’t want to go outside, but feeling no threat and hearing! no sound from the object I thought I could just get a video of it as it went over me.  However, as I hold up my cell phone, the object starts rapidly traveling North again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I feel that it saw me and didn’t want to be taped.  The second video does not even show the object, despite my eyes seeing it.  During this time, there were no small planes in the area, but after watching it disappear out of sight the second time, I saw a small plane in the distance by the Vero Beach Airport.  I saw planes over the house earlier in the evening, they never fly that low, and I can always hear them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have 2 videos and have taken still pictures from the first video.  When enlarging the still pictures, one of them looks like a face, and one of them looks like a swirly thing that could propel something if it weren’t in a gaseous bubble?

The three lights were heading towards me going north.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first they were moving horizontally together.  The object on the left seemed to slow down and immediately started to fade out.<n> <n><n> <n><n> While this happened the object in the center made two sporadic movements.  It seemed to slow down and then move to the right and back to the left.  The object on the left continued to fade until I could no longer see it.  While fading in brightness, it still remained red.  I ran to my brother’s house next door to mine and rang the doorbell.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I continued watching the lights and the two remaining lit up objects began to fade at the same time.  My brother and his wife came outside but by the time they looked up the lights had faded.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I continued watching and in the horizon I could make out two objects that looked like parachutes getting closer to the ground.  They were far away from where I was but if they continued to fall they would have landed on the rims here.  Logan international airport is on top of the rims and would have been extremely close to the area where these object were heading.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I continued to watch in the sky for about 10 more minutes but did not see any other activity.  I came in my house and did not know who to call but remembered the UFO hotline that I heard about from Coast to Coast.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I called and gave a brief statement on the phone.  I called KTVQ news station here in Billings, but the lady I talked did not hear of any sightings or strange lights in the sky.<n>

White small, large red, white small, large red, white small, arranged like they would be on a plane.  Except they were much larger, all on one craft, not separate lights.  It was about a mile or less up and it was descending rapidly.

I came to the end of the road and made a left turn, went a few feet and looked over my right shoulder to see where it was.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was about 100’ high or less, in the backyard of a house right where I made the turn.

This should have been the back of the craft, yet it looked the same.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had a brief thought that it was some type of radio controlled toy, but it was too large approx 20’ across or larger, and the lights were so big that they touched, so 5 lights covered a span of 20’ or so.  I drove home resisting the urge to follow it.<n>

We are on a hill.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The dogs in our neighborhood were barking very erratically which kind of freaked him out.  He saw a large saucer shaped object (approximating) 3 miles away, 1,000 feet in elevation, 75 yards wide, 30 feet tall.  It was hovering over the water.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It had a very brilliant bright stream of red, white, and gold lights in a line around the rim of it and faint light coming from the top.<n> <n><n> <n><n> He yelled for us to come outside and my brother came out first.  It vanished as my dad was yelling for us to come out.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My brother did not see it when he came outside.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About 10 seconds later it appeared before their eyes.  Seemingly materializing out of thin air.  The rest of us came out and observed the object hovering over the watering looking as though it was rotating.  It hovered for about a minute and a half.<n> <n><n> <n><n> All of a sudden the right side tilted upward at about a 30 degree angle, and slowly flew to the left, still maintaining that angle, then sped up and disappeared behind the trees.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I tried to record it on my phone but it wouldn&#39;t focus and the craft would not show up on my screen even though I was pointing my phone directly at it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The observers were My Father ((forties)); My Mother ((forties)); Myself, Their Daughter ((twenties))); My Brother ((teens)); My Boyfriend ((twenties)), My son ((youngster)).<n>

My mom was on the mobile at the time talking to my grandmother, when we suddenly saw a bright object in the sky flying at a slow speed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We thought it was a plane at first but we then noticed it had no blinking lights.  It was more like a star in the way it glowed.  A very bright star.  Then it suddenly stopped its track and started lowering in altitude.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We live in El Hatillo, which is a big hill in the capital city.  There are alot of pine trees and the object almost got lost in the tree tops.  I bent a little to be able to see it.  My mom kept talking to my grandma narrating the whole experience.  She kept telling us to photograph it but I had my mobile charging in my room and my mom wouldn´t stop talking from nervousness.  In any case we we´re both to amazed to do anything but watch.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object remained there standind still in mid air (it never reached land) for what seemed a few minutes.  Then suddenly it dashed upwards at a 45 degree angle into the sky and disappeared.<n>

She called me out and said &#39;you&#39;ve got to see this.&#39;<n> <n><n> <n><n> I run outside and in the sky nearly overhead is this point of white light- reminded me of how the International Space Station looks at night when it passes over, but this was broad daylight!<n> <n><n> <n><n> My mom said at first it was just floating around in various circles for a couple of minutes- at first she thought it might be a bird, but it looked like a point of &#39;light&#39; and was way too high in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was watching it now and it danced or circled a bit in the sky, then started moving in a stark straight path overhead.  From my vantage point it moved about 6-8 foot across the sky, which could&#39;ve been 50 or 60 miles at its elevation- it was way up there- way up above where a balloon might fly or a bird might soar.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It stopped- and it just looked like a round pin point of fairly bright light, like the ISS or a bright satellite.  It stayed stationery for about 15-20 seconds, then it started moving back in the opposite direction in a straight trajectory.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We both watched it move across the sky- it went behind some thin cirrus clouds and as it moved further away, then it became visible again as it moved on past the clouds, and then farther away out of our eye sight.  In another 30 seconds it had moved completely out of our sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We watched this object for about 8-10 minutes.  I&#39;ve never seen anything like it in broad daylight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;ve seen satellites at night and the ISS, but this was something that moved very differently.   It didn&#39;t move &#39;fast&#39; but at a steady pace, plus with it&#39;s dancing/ circling earlier in the viewing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was a bright clear day, no wind, light, high cirrus clouds.  Luke AFB is about 15 miles from me, but I don&#39;t think this was anything from them- they fly F16&#39;s and F35&#39;s out of that base.  However, today there were NO air exercises from Luke.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I tried to video it, but the sky being so bright, the object being bright, yet small, I couldn&#39;t get it to show up on the screen.<n>

We were talking about something or other and out of the corner of my eye I noticed something strange.  At first glance I thought it was a flock of birds in a “V” formation but after I looked closer, I realized they were lights with a reddish-white glow.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There were approximately 10-12 of these lights forming the shape and the V was not a solid shape, with each light moving individually and the “V” shape was changing as well, with one side becoming longer and almost straightening out into a full line as it flew across the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After I noticed it, I pointed it out immediately and the other two people witnessed it as well.  It was a clear night and the lights stood out greatly in contrast to the sky.  The entire event lasted about 20-25 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The lights came from the north-east sky and travelled of in a western direction.  The lights came overhead of us and past us and then just disappeared from sight.  They didn’t appear to move away quickly as they were before but they just simply disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am a business professional with a college degree and I have never experienced anything like this.  I can usually explain most things of this nature but the way this craft moved was the most inhuman thing I have ever seen.  So fluid and quiet, no sound from engines and each light in the “V” formation was moving independently with all the lights finally almost completely straightening out before disappearing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Definitely strange and most certainly not anything of this world.<n>

While locking my front door as I left my house, I quickly glanced up in the sky northward.  Above the trees and houses about 4-6 blocks north of my house, an orange ball of light appeared and then fell slowly, almost like a shooting star but without the tail.  The ball of light was much larger than any stars in the sky, had an amber color, and made no sound.  I realized the orange glowing ball wasn’t a shooting star, or plane, because the object fell below the tree lines and was much larger and brighter than any stars I have experienced previously.  I called my friend, and told her I saw something strange without giving her any details.

I was talking on the phone to a friend.  I turned right onto a dark, but fairly well traveled back road to continue about 10 minutes to my house.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I noticed on my left, right at the top of the treeline at the power lines was this really big &#34;thing&#34;.   It made no sound, &amp; resembled a house or something with a bunch of windows on it.  I say windows because there was light being emitted from these windows that put out a sun ray type appearance.  It reminded me of a 2 story house that had every light on in every window.  It made no sound at all and was very low.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Below all of the &#34;windows&#34; with white rays coming out, there were sporadic, blinking, red and yellowish/orange lights.  It was JUST SITTING THERE!  If I had to estimate the size, I held up my Samsung Galaxy S4 at arms length, and the &#34;thing&#34; was maybe 1/2 it&#39;s size.  But there was no movement, nothing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had slowed to maybe 5 mph, if that, and was describing it to my friend who I was still on the phone with.  I had stopped in the middle of the road and was fumbling with my phone, in the dark, to try to get it to camera mode to take a photo, but 3 cars came up behind me and I had to start driving again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I got to my house, still on phone, and was on my deck just outside my back door, and I could see the &#34;craft&#34; above the treetops slowly gliding ESE towards Rte. 6A in Dennis by the beaches.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This thing seems to glow almost orange from within, and the white rays along with the blinking yellow and red lights continued.  If I dime at arm&#39;s length, this would have been the size of the craft as I watched it from my deck. It made no noise, and was very slowly gliding away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The entire time I was describing it to my friend on the phone.<n>

It also was changing altitudes it would get really high then slowly come lower.  At its lowest point I saw 2 triangle shaped objects really close to each other, they were circling around one another as they both were zooming around,  I&#39;m talking they were hauling butt, they would zoom left then right over and over for 2 hours, towards the end I saw the object change color and shape it went from orange to a whitish blue and had a teardropped light with 2 arbitures coming from both sides forming a spider leg type appearance my friends saw this change too.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We also thruster pulses.  Say if it would go left we would see thruster pulses coming from the right.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were also around cows, the cows began mooing really loud as the object would get closer.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Also the object was emiting pulse type lights around it.<n>

It disappeared before I could take a picture.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;m still astounded as to what I saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Did anyone else besides my family and I in baltimore city, MD, see this event?<n>

I almost ignored it till I realized it was not a reflection (No tv or light on in my room).<n> <n><n> <n><n> Watched as red light shot off west and blue one arced downward.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Told husband who suggested kids with roman candles trying to be funny, but there was no sound to go with it (and the lights were close enough where, if they had been fireworks, there would have been noticable bangs).<n> <n><n> <n><n> A few minutes later, the lights were back.  Red light made a big circle while the blue one hovered, then arced downward again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This happened twice more, in slightly different locations (like they were moving in a pattern towards the west).<n> <n><n> <n><n> Around 23:50, they vanished.  Watched until after midnight but no more lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Witnesses were myself (female, age 36, master&#39;s degree, writer stay at home mom) and my husband (32, male, aerospace/aviation engineer by training and teacher currently).<n> <n><n> <n><n> The weather was overcast and humid and the geography is the edge of the Gulf Coast where it runs into the Pineywoods.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We&#39;re in suburban neighborhood but with woods and a huge state park nearby, along with several creeks and a river.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The lights themselves looked about the size of a car headlight when seen from my bedroom window, in terms of size not brightness.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We do live near an airport but I can guarantee, as can my aerospace/aviation engineer husband, plane and helicopter lights do not behave like this.<n>

I was holding my tablet above our heads and looking at the shapes on the constellations, when all of a sudden my tablet which was at 90% charge shut down, and we were unable to get it back on.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We then decided to grab our phones from our pockets to download the same application and continue were we left off, but our cell phones were both off and unable to turn on as well.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So we just started looking at rhe sky thinking nothing of it when my mother opens the back door and says to my father the lights in the house are flashing on and off rapidly.  We then notice both house&#39;s next to ours are doing the same.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So my father being retired law enforcement starts to access the situation when he says to my god, look at that.  Me and my mother of course look and we all see this triangle shaped craft that kind of appeared out of nowhere.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was coming from one horizon to the other.  When it became closer to us we realized the massive size of this craft and how low to the ground it was.  It couldnt have been more then 5 or 600 feet up.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As it slowly moved over our block the flickering of the lights became more rapid and then as it came overhead the lights were completly out on the entire block, it became almost pich black.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As it heads toward the opposite horizon it gained altitude and then completly stopped in the sky.  Then the triangle separated perfectly in half.  It hovered there for two or three minutes and without making any sound both halves went in opposite directions at an incredible rate of speed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Once the craft took off almost instantly the lights in our house along with every house we could see turned on at the same time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have never heard my father say anything about ufo or anything close to it.  Being a police officer, it could have jeopardized his career and credibility.<n> <n><n> <n><n> But my parents and I could find no reason for what could have caused for such strange things in what seemed like the longest 15 minute of my life.<n>

It looked like it was hanging there motionless!  I pulled over and stopped to see what it was and to see if it really was motionless.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Once I was stopped,I could see that this object was actually moving very,very slowly to the west.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I got a pretty good look at it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was roughly tadpole shaped with a little nub of some sort sticking out on one side.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was not at all smooth looking like a helicopter or plane.  It had a lot of angles all over it so it looked kind of lumpy.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;m mildly color blind,but this looked thing like the color of an old penny...metallic,but not very reflective at all.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It had no wings, no windows, no propellers, no rotors, no landing gear and no markings of any kind.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It kind of reminded me of a clenched fist where the knuckles were the angles mentioned above.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This thing looked too bulky and non-aerodynamic to fly! It was at about the height where a helicopter would fly...low enough to see well.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was hovering over the part of Cassadaga swamp that curves around the end of the hill towards Stockton and Stockton State Forest.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I looked at it for a moment and asked myself &#34;What the hell is that?&#34; Lacking an answer (and a camera) and having time constraints,I moved on.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I kept watching it through the trees until the terrain obscured it from my sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I entered the intersection with Ellery - Centralia road I looked back over my shoulder out the drivers side window.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was the object...looking the same...but now moving quite quickly toward where I had just come from.<n> <n><n> <n><n> If I&#39;d had a camera I would&#39;ve probably turned left and tried to get some pictures of it. Who knows what might&#39;ve happened then! (Even though it was April Fools day I don&#39;t think this thing could have been any kind of hoax! There&#39;s noone to prank out there over the swamp!)  I told a few people about this and,a few days later,this one lady said her husband works with someone who lives near there.<n> <n><n> <n><n> She said that this person supposedly saw the same object on the same day I did. I dont know what time they saw it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Over time,a lot of strange things have been seen around Cassadaga Swamp and the surrounding area!
