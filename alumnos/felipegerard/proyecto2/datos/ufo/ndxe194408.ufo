He said it was like no plane he had ever seen as it was much bigger than anything of that time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Immediately, my grandfather and his friends ran back to a barn and stayed in there until they were sure the saucer had gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> For many years he thought it must have been a new German bomber, as he had never seen a German plane in the war at all as he was in such a remote location. It was not until he moved to Canada in the early 1950s and UFO hysteria gripped North America that he believed what he had seen was a spaceship.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am entirely confident that my Grandfather saw what he claimed to have seen as he was a very honest man and was a policeman for 18 years.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.
