I was still on the third floor steps when I looked west up to the sky and i saw something very amazing!  I saw a &#34;V&#34; shaped craft with yellowish reflectors or lights heading east.  It was going the same speed as a plane.  I thought to myself &#34;are those a flock of bird? Is it a plane?&#34;  I watched it go by over my head and kept blinking my eyes and shifting them because i was amazed at what i saw.  If it was a flock of birds i was waiting for them to move a different direction as they always do.  I also looked for the blinking red lights that they have on a planes.  It didnt do or have either.... It was wierd because if you didnt look up you wouldnt notice it since the lights were very dimly lit or they kinda reminded me of reflectors and the Craft itself was almost transluscent although you can tell it was like matted black color. What it reminded me the most was the creature in the movie &#34;Predator&#34; looked like... sort of reflecting its surroundings, but yet you still are able to see the shape and color. It was still light out and i was able to see the shape which was like a &#34;V&#34;... with lights under it or reflectors.  It was going at a speed as a plane then it speeded up ... before it disappeared it tumbled (like a fighter jet pilot would do for fun) then POOF... it disappeared into thin air.  There was a plane heading towards it and i thought it might hit it, but it disappeared.  I KNOW that pilot had to have seen it.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

First noticed when it was straight up (90 deg.). Object moved slower than a jet at cruising speed, but faster than a piston- or turboprop-powered aircraft. Color was very white. No sound. Object lost to view due to ground lights interfering with view as it moved to the south. Immediately afterwards two jet aircraft were seen (and heard) moving in formation from NW to SE. From speed and formation, they appeared to be fighters. (Note: nearest base for fighters is Fresno ANGB,the 144th Fighter Wing with F-16s) I am a future USN officer, and am familiar with aircraft day and night, as I live in the traffic pattern for Fresno-Yosemite IAP.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I kept watching it and  saw it was not flying it was hovering over a field and as truck went by it it appeared to be triangular in shape with a flashing white light on it&#39;s rear and a steady green light in front of the white flashing one.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In front was a large light array which dimmed to a dull reddish glow by the time the truck went by. It made no noise that I could hear and was just sitting in the air over this field. It was very dark that morning but it looked like a triangle shape against the clouds. We drove past it with no other incident.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Iremember thinking it must have been a star because iit wasn&#39;t moving.I didn&#39;t think anything unusual about it other than the intensity of the light(lack of sleep, sick with cold, restless baby were factors )Then, I looked away and almost immeditely my husband was in a panic and started freaking out , baby starts crying, and my husband said, Did u see that? did you see that? and i saiid what the light? and he said yeaah, i looked to where i seen the &#34;bright star&#34; and it was gone. It was a clear night and and i could see other stars in the sky where it had been but dim in light by comparison. I had just missed it when i looked away to tend to our baby.my husband who seen this bright diamond light come directly toward us in the sky and lit up our bedroom the silence fell among us and we could feel and hear these rythmetic vibrations (whommm... whommm... whomm) I will now turn the commentary to my husband, Here is what my husband has to say from the time i looked away (I hadn&#39;t told him of the &#34;bright star): we had both seen the bright lite but my wife was unable to stay focused on it due to rockin the baby back to sleep. I had become fixiated on the bright, twinkling object that had now begun moving in a fast &#39;swirling&#39; motion-like a merry go round with bright lights that were the color of candles with a purple twinge to it. At this point maybe 5 min. had passed. As my wife looked away the object then dashed toward out house at an exceptionally fast speed, with the bottom of the object looking like a lit up honeycomb with lights. Then it was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The object had a bright (white) center to it and it emitted sparks to the side and back of the object as it fell with an amazing speed.  It dissapeared below the horizan in the direction that would take it over Newport Beach in a line with Long Beach and then Point Magoo CA.  It could have landed in the water infront of the LAX airport.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It looked like a sparkler being thrown through the air (exactly like)and not like any of the image I have seen on any asteroid or space junk as there was no tail  or illuminated glow around the object suggesting fire or great heat.  Just the sparking that did not form a tail or any sort behind the object.  Of course it was a dark night and if there was smoke I would have not seen it.  It happened so fast that if you were not ready there was no way to warn anyone to look that way or the other to catch a glimps of it.  It moved at an incredable speed and there was no glow from an impact when it hit earth.  It also had no curve to its flight as it went straight in.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

With fear of the unknown I slowed my car to a crawl and went into some kind of hypnosis in which I jumped out of my car and was takin into the alien craft. While in the alien craft they preformed funny little tricks with me, called me names, and hasseled me. Now you can imagine how i felt, like a bag of sundried apricots, they started to talk to me in some sort of goofy langauge and to touch me, im not going into detail but you can only imagine. I haven&#39;t been able to go to the bathroom right since. If you could please look into this and see if this has happened to anyone else it would make my heart turn happy.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thanks for your time, ((name deleted))<n>

I’m not sure of the height, but the object would have been hidden by a quarter, placed in front of me at arm’s length.  It seemed to &#34;float,&#34; moving slightly back and forth.  I immediately thought it was a hawk soaring on thermals, as I’ve seen them in this area before. This lasted about 5 minutes, and then the object moved away from me and was beyond the horizon in just a matter of 3 to 5 seconds, without leaving any type of contrail.  That’s when I realized it wasn’t a hawk, nor an airplane, because of the great speed at which it disappeared.  I’ve watched high-flying jets and they literally take minutes to travel from directly overhead to the horizon.<n>

The sky was not totally dark yet, I would say it was about 20-25 minutes before max darkness.  When the Space Station was approx. 60 degrees above the eastern horizon I observed an extremely bright light develop rapidly about 5-10 degrees to the left (north) of the Space Station and apparently slightly below the equivelent elevation of the Station.  The light developed rapidly to a brightness about ten times the magnitude of Venus, about 4 or 5 times the brightness of a landing light.  It lasted for about 4 seconds and then rapidly dimmed to a glowing pinpoint as it traveled very slowly from my right to left.  The trajectory appeared to be about 10-15 degrees apart from a line directly between me and the object, I could not tell if it was coming toward me or going away (although my initial impression was that it was coming toward me), and I estimate it&#39;s position as somewhere over northern Montana. It continued to dim and vanished as it moved slowly.  It appeared to move much more slowly than a meteor, although the shallow angle might account for that.  It was the brightest thing I have ever witnessed in the sky other than the moon or the sun.  I have witnessed many meteors but my first remark to my mother, who saw the object also, was, &#34;what the hell is that?!&#34;  I thought it might be a module that, according to the NASA website, would soon detach from the Space Station and burn up in the atmosphere, however that would most likely appear to be UNDER the trajectory of the Station, and I doubt they would do it over a populated area.  I have been an Air Traffic Controller for the FAA at six different control towers for a total of 21 years, 4 years before that on a carrier in the Navy, I have close to 1,000 hours of flight time with Commercial License, Flight Instructor, and Instrument Flight Ratings, am a qualified Weather Observer, and have never seen anything like it.  If it was a meteor it had to be very large, but appeared to be moving MUCH slower than a meteor.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness is aviation specialist, and commercial pilot, and we found him to be exceptionally credible.  There were no Iridium satellite flashes at the time of the event.<n>

As I went outside I heard a cat crying out in pain. Long story short, i found a stay cat that was reall just skin an bones.... it ate 5 cans of cat food... :\  But as I was feeding this poor kitty, I saw a bright white light off in the distance. I would say it was SOUTH WEST of true north.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is not the first UFO I have seen in these parts. Last time I saw a UFO WEST of my location.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I live OUTSIDE of Edmonton, Alberta.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am near 2 SMALL air ports. So I see alot of planes. I even remeber once I saw a black unmarked helecopter as a child that flew no more than 10-20 feet over out house... I never thought about the importance of that incedent till recently. See as how thoes unmarked helecopters have been reported many times when it came to UFOs and even more CATTLE mutalations. Altought as far as I know I personly have not heard of cattle mutalations in my area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Anyways, as I was feeding this poor cat, I saw a bright light off in the distance. Off in the direction of SHERWOOD PARK. It is a town outside of Edmonton. I wanted to eyeball this light as long as I could, but trying to keep attention to the poor sick cat and the fact that small trees where in my way. I did not stay entirely focused to it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I would say about a minute or 2 after I saw the bright light, it just vanished.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I would say it was VERY far away, but it could not of been a star consider how low it was to the horizen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This time of year up here it gets dark quite quickly, and I can honestly say I have never seen a star that was that bright at this time, or even moved around for that matter.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This bright object moved around a tiny bit within the 1 to 2 minutes I watched it. It did not move in random patterns... But I would say it moved UP... not UP UP like into space or the atomsphere, but UP....<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was a LARGE distance away, but no plane or anything of that nature could produce such a bright light from that far away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I really wanted to get my binoculars, so I could view the object, but being only human, I could only help the poor starving cat. I lost site of the object, (from my view from beyond the trees) quite quit.<n> <n><n> <n><n> All the trees around here have lost thier leaves, but I still was not wearing my glasses. But for a bright object to dissapear like that within the time period and direction it was moving and the fact there was no red or blue lights, which rules out any airplane, just leaves me boggled.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I lived on farm land, and from whats I have noticed on this web site is that sometimes &#34;Advertizing lights&#34; can be a factor in a UFO report. But let me tell you this, never have I heard or seen or even considered the fact that advertising lightings will be within or around the area of Edmonton, Alberta.<n> <n><n> <n><n> OH, and if your wondering, the stray cat is at a SAFE shelter now. :) By now he will of been adopted.<n> <n><n> <n><n> If I had to estimate the distance of the object I would say......<n> <n><n> <n><n> Quite far.....<n> <n><n> <n><n> From my current location, I would say I was still a large distance away...<n> <n><n> <n><n> Even if I got over to the closest highway, I would still say I was still 1/6 distance away from it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was far... but very bright.<n> <n><n> <n><n> FYI: I also saw this object, while an Meteor shower was occouring, and I can tell you that this was no Meteor.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

High altitude orange object observed nearly straight up from viewer and slightly east, first thought to be a satelitte moving from south to north, but object slowed, stopped and then made slow steady movements east then south then north and repeated motion with some variations. Visible stars (that didn&#39;t move) confirmed the motion and actions of the light. Could have been a very high altitude DEA or customs craft, but there was no sound. Sighting occurred one hour before sunrise in totally clear skies, three hours after a thunderstorm. Object faded away after five minutes of the movement. Location was above Key West NAS, but was very high. No pulsating light..solid. Photo taken, not yet developed. Not expected much, due to light levels and high altitude, even with lens extension.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

A bright flashing of red white and another unexplainable color were displayed but in more of a sequence of rotations around the object though it was to far away to determine the size, shape, or color of the craft im sure it was nothing commercial......we observed it for quite a while and it never moved and unbenounced to my knowledge there are no towers or structures with these lights that far out in the ocean or that high in altitude off the coast of south carolina....i just went and looked to see if the lights were still there but some substantial cloud cover has rolled in since i started typing this.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Both lights were identical and brighter than plane lights and not blinking as a plane&#39;s would.  I&#39;ve never observed anything quite like this and called my Mom out to witness the event.  The sky was partly cloudy with a bright moon as we viewed the two lights appear to move about the speed of a low altitude plane, but there was no sound whatsoever.  As the two lights went behind some trees the first one disappeared, but we viewed the second light continue in its path and appear to move in front of the clouds.  We watched the one remaining light continue off into the east and into heavier clouds while glowing very brightly.  Occasionally the solid orange light would flicker slightly but continue to glow brighter than anything I&#39;m use to seeing in the sky.  I deliver newspapers at night and am use to viewing planes at night as well as meteor showers and even satellites and I&#39;m positive these were not astronomical in nature, and not any kind of aircraft I&#39;ve ever witnessed before.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I figured that they must and went in and forgot about it. About 30min. later I heard some people outside and decided to check it out. I watched the children that were making the noise and before going inside I looked up and noticed another similar light moving in the same direction but it was a little further west than before. As I watched it I saw it go from a south-to-north direction, into a more norteastern direction, but it was soon evident that the object wasnt moving northeastern, it was gaining altitude. It only lasted a few seconds before it dissapeered into the sky going almost straight up. The light was the same color as the rest of the stars and about the same intensity as the most intense stars.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
11/27/04 18:30|Lewisville|TX|Egg|an hour|Bright lights in Lewisville, TX|12/3/04|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/040/S40834.html|27|ndxe200411| Bright lights in Lewisville, TX<n> <n><n> <n><n> Peter, at your request I am entering an extended, more detailed report of what I saw on Saturday night near Dallas.  Lewisville is a city just north of Dallas, maybe 10 miles from North Dallas.  I had been shopping that evening with a friend and my son, we got home around 6:15 or so.  I put all my bags down and went out to the patio.  There, I saw my neighbor, Rich, outside on his patio.  He was looking into the sky, nothing unusual for any of us.  He asked me to look at what he was seeing.  I looked through a break between the tree and the building next to my apartment building.  There is a 4 foot, or so, space between them.  I looked in the direction of what seemed to be the north-western horizon.  There were balls of light going up into the air.  At first I asked if they were balloons, Rich explained that he had been watching them for a while and didn&#39;t think they acted much like a balloon.  I continued to watch them, as I watched more and more would come up into my line of vision.  Altogether, there would be anywhere from 9 to 15 of these individual balls of light in a group.  This group would move upward towards the stars, but always staying in formation.  The formations were nothing I have ever seen before.  There seemed to always be a &#34;lead&#34; ball of light, then two or three in a pattern behind it.  Then the other 6 or so would be in a half circle behind the lead balls.  (weird!).  As I became increasingly curious about what we were seeing, I began to realize that they couldn&#39;t have been balloons as they went a great distance into the sky.  Once they got up high enough to where you had to bend your head backwards to see them, it resembled a moving constellation.  It would be like watching the Big Dipper move across the sky.  At that point, Rich and I were very interested in what was happening.  I called a friend of mine, Jennifer, and she came out to her patio.  At this time, my son Jake came outside to see what the fuss was about.  We all stood there and watched another group go up into space.  This group acted the same way as the first.  Then, a third group.  With the third group, my son noticed that the &#34;lead&#34; light would stop, or appear to stop, and wait for the others to catch up.  At one point, there were two smaller balls of light that seemed to be &#34;playing tag&#34; as my son discribes it.  One was in front of the other and the front one would zig zag from left to right and the one behind it would &#34;chase&#34; it.  Very interesting to see.  On the fourth batch, we had two pairs of binoculars out (myself and Rich) and we couldn&#39;t get a much clearer view of them.  Almost like they were either too far away to actually see, even with magnification, or they were so bright that it seemed distorted when I tried to see them.  During the second group rising, Jennifer noticed a very odd, very thick and extremely white fog (for lack of a better word) on the horizon.  She pointed it out to us, we all saw it and watched as it rose, but it rose staying intact.  Unlike a building fire smoke, this seemed to stay just as white and just as thick as it was when it was lower on the horizon.  This display lasted approximately one hour.  I will never forget the way that these objects seemed to have a purpose, a direction.  They seemed to almost communicate in that they all knew where to go and how to take their place in &#34;line&#34; (although they never traveled in a straight line).  The best way to describe them, for me, was moving constellations.  Very bright, very large (although there were smaller ones as well), very organized objects in &#34;flight&#34;.  When asked how big they seemed to be in relation to a star, my feeling is that the brightest star in the sky that night, was half the size of the objects passing by it.  This was the most awesome, curious thing I have ever seen and I hope to one day find out what it could have been.  Please let me know if you have any information.  Thank you.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Second report from same witness.  We post both reports.  We spoke with this witness, and we found her to be exceptionally credible.   PD))<n>
11/27/04 18:30|Lewisville|TX|Light|1 hour|My friends and I saw up to 40 lights in the North Texas sky.|12/3/04|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/040/S40817.html|28|ndxe200411| My friends and I saw up to 40 lights in the North Texas sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On 11/27/2004 around 16:30 I was arriving home from Christmast shopping with friends.  I live on the third floor of an apartment building in Lewisville Texas (North Dallas).  When I reached the top of the stairs something caught my eye in the sky.  I turned and saw about 8-10 objects in the Northern horizon moving up and to the east.  Just to the Northwest of these lights was a low hanging strange like smoke that moved in the same direction of the lights.  I watched lights for about 30 seconds, thinking they where balloons.  Then I went into my house.  Immediately upon entering my house I received a telephone call from a friend of mine that lives on the second floor of my building, come outside on the patio immediately.  By this time, her son was on the patio as well as my neighbor that lives directly below me.  We began to watch these 10-12 of these objects in the sky.  My friends looked at them with binoculars and we quickly decided that they where not balloons but some type of light.  They seemed to launch from somewhere on the horizon and move up and to the right.  We watched this set of lights until they we could no longer see them anymore.  This went on for about an hour.  I would say we saw a total of 4 sets of these lights.  We where so amazed with the lights and the strange looking fog on the horizon that we failed to take any pictures.  Living near DFW airport we are use to seeing lots of airplanes.  We did not see airplanes last night, we even joked because we saw airplanes flying in different points in the sky.  At one point 2 of the lights almost played with each other by jerking back and forth, like they where playing tug of war.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with this witness, and we found her to be exceptionally credible.

But as it passed over, it seemed to change direction slightly toward the East-Southeast before dimming out as it reached 30-40 degrees above the horizon. Definitely not an aircraft. Possibly a satellite. But when it dimmed to barely visible it stayed that way for several seconds before going out completely; not like an object with the sun being reflected off of it, which should have dimmed out completely right away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((ADDENDUM FROM MUFON/OREGON))<n> <n><n> <n><n> Probably satellite sighting<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is in reference to the above previously reported sighting. Based on a &#34;Starry Night&#34; computer simulation of satellite orbits, a crossing of the International Space Station occurred from 18:25 to 18:31 on the night in question. This very closely coincides with the witness&#39; observation from Salem, Oregon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am suggesting that this sighting is a _probable_ observation of the International Space Station.

It trhilled us all to know someone else had a sighting the same night we did.You said she was in lewisville, tx which is in the same direction the craft we saw would have passed over if it continued on the same path. How interesting!After our sighting of the low flying double triangle craft at malakoff,tx we came back to our home in athens and got my binoculars. As i told you we continued to see extremely heavy air traffic coming in from the south appearing to be at different alititudes.We drove toward the south then i stopped off of hiway 287 on 488, there was another aircraft coming toward us. I watched it with my binoculars. As it passed over i could clearly see a single triangle shaped aircraft with a white light on each corner and a red blinking light on the right tip.A green blinking light on the leftThe more i think about the aircraft at malakoff, if you took two of the single aircraft and connected them where there should be some kind of thrust output,then turned it sideways that would be exactly what i saw at the roadside park.I stated that the malakoff aircraft had 4 white lights, all the others had 3 lights, maybe when they docked with each other two of the lights on the rear are covered up by something.Then again maybe the single triangle aircraft were usaf stealth fighters following the aircraft i described at malakoff,tx.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was drifting west bu the wind was out of the west. Then it stopped for several minutes. It was about a mile of less away and probably in the range of 800 to a 1000 feet in the air. It had no gondola on the bottom and it glowed like the moon would glow when it&#39;s full. The coloring was that of the moon but with some tinted areas on the surfaced of pale oranges and blues. It seemed to be lit inside the object. I grabbed my digital still camera out of my car and took three pictures of the craft, then went into the house and got my cam corder. When I came out it was gone after about 30 seconds. No ballooon can move that fast. There was no sound qat all. When I got back home to Illinois I downloaded the three images I took and they  were blank. That has never happened before or since with my camera.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I origionally thought it was an interesting cloud formation -- a small blob about the size of a full moon with a sort of comet tail -- I didn&#39;t think anything of it while i was loading my car for a trip into Longview.  While in my car heading east on SR4 I noticed the formation was still there! (a little lower in the sky) It looked just like a bright comet... tail and all.  About 2 minutes into the trip I remembered I had my digital video camera with me in my computer bag.  I started shooting blindly out the windshield but quickly realised that this was not going to work.  About a mile and a half up the road was a viewing area/turn out that faced the Columbia River where I got out and got decent shots of the fireball.     I have about 90 seconds of fair footage (I am NOT a video film photographer by a long stretch!).... I only wish I started filming a lot sooner.  I reported this to the local astronomy group (Friends of Galileo) who didn&#39;t hear of anything expected to be fallen from the sky in our area.  I am sure it is space junk but it was pretty amazing.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I was walking to my car on my lunch break (I work 2nd shift) and I happened to look up at the moon. The clouds were moving off the moon and I saw what looked like lights or delierately moving pieces of light that had cloud around them. At first they were coming from the dark of the sky towards the light of the moon the lights would collide and go off in 4 different directions. As I watched I noticed they weren&#39;t generated from a ground source because there was no trail to the ground. I noticed that the lights moved deliberately but not always in the same pattern sometimes three of the lights would come together and the 4th would come just after. I called back into my office and asked two friends to come down and look at this. As I waited the lights started to fade away becoming less distinct and the pattern of their movement became more erratic. My two friends arrived to see a little of what I saw. They saw that the objects didn&#39;t have a ground trail like a search light would and they saw the lights moving in patterns but as we all stood there the lights disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

We made our way up to Gifford Pinchot National Forest to find the perfect tree for our home. We did, and I took pictures as my husband and step-son cut the tree down.  The discovery was made this afternoon, Sunday, Nov. 28, 2004 when my husband uploaded his camera to see the pictures I had taken.  The picture and the little green circle is what caught his interest. Among the mist of trees and brush is a small green circle. When my husband enlarged the picture of the little green circle, two eyes and a nose can be seen.  Even though it is green and comaflaged within the trees and brush, it does not look like part of the scenery.  I would appreciate your input and your thoughts or if I am totally out of my mind.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thank you for your time,<n>

Stopped when vehicle stopped and appeared to hover.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was only one object. It was similar to an egg silver in color with what appeared to be a orange stripe on the side. It would stop when the cars occupants stopped and speed up when they came to wooded areas so that it appeared the object was trying to beat them to the clearing.It was &#34;similar to a blimp but a lot smaller minus the passenger area.&#34; One witness thought she saw what appeared to be green writing on the side.<n> <n><n> <n><n> *****----my experience was so similar, my husband and I are a bit freaked now.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was Black Friday, the day after Thanksgiving this year 2004. My husband and I were driving our kids to his sisters house for her to watch them while we tried our hand at Black Friday shopping. It was about 4:30/5 in the morning. We were traveling south east on route 20 in Sussex County Delaware. I noticed this bright ‘star’ on the left side of the road above the woods. My husband commented about how bright it was. I said yeah…it must be the north star…but no that wouldn’t make sense since we were traveling south east. I’m VERY interested in the stars and the sky and UFO’s and such so I kept staring at it because it was so bright…then it crossed the road and was on the right side of the road…I said to my husband “Um…its on this side now…” (I was in the passenger seat) We kept traveling on route 20 towards Millsboro and it was following us. I made the comment as such. It would seem to stop in the sky…then speed up to keep up with us…it stayed in view of my passenger side window the entire time on 20. It was very high in the sky, so that all we could see was like a round..ball of bright light. When we came to the 113 junction to make a right, the object was going straight and made a sharp right, like a 90 degree turn to stay with us. This scared me a bit. I said to my husband “Holy sh*t, its seriously following us…” We were a bit uneasy…but continued on 113 for a bit then turned into the old Acme parking lot to get to his mothers development, on Mitchell Rd. The object was now above a wooded area near the railroad tracks behind the development…to the right of her home. We took our kids in and we came out and I observed the object was still there. I said to my husband “Its hovering over the woods there”…we left making our way down by the bowling alley on Mitchell Rd in town in Millsboro. I looked back and sure enough there it was, following us again. I exclaimed to my husband, “Its following us! Atleast we know its not after the kids (relief)” We turned onto route 24, going from Millsboro to Long Neck to Rehoboth. The object  followed us the entire way, doing that stop in the sky, speed up thing as if to keep up with us, but not pass us. There were just a few other cars on the road near Mountaire in Millsboro, I told my husband I didn’t care how fast he had to go, he had to keep up with another car…I didn’t want to be the only car on the road for fear of giving whatever was following us an opportunity to perhaps ‘beam us up’ We stopped at a stoplight and then my husband accelerated very fast  to see if the object would do the same, it did. Near the volunteer fire company on 24, I could see the object a little clearer. It was soo bright that it like ‘twinkled’ blue and red but so so bright..like the florescent blue light, bright. I noticed as we passed the new high school and nursing school that it would dim, them brighten..then dim..then brighten…I peered close and it reminded me of a lighthouse light..turning…like it was TURNING, the light would dissipate then come back as if it made a full circle. It was too high in the sky to be a helicopter, there was no noise and a normal aircraft would NOT follow our path to Kmart at about 5:30ish in the morning as it was. When we made our right turn onto rt 1, again, the object made a sharp right turn to keep up with us but now it was visible in my husbands driver side window. We went to Kmart and the light stopped right over Kmart. I don’t know if anyone else noticed this since everyone was so preoccupied with getting in line for holiday shopping but I wonder if anyone else traveling the road DID notice. Though it was kind of frightening it was absolutely fascinating to me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> And now since reading such a similar story in the same vicinity, whoa, its mind blowing.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
11/25/04 23:30|San Marcos & Escondido|CA|Light|2 Minutes|SMALL ORANGE LIGHT - flew low over Hwy 78 and then South along I-15 (nearly overhead) with seemingly no visible craft attacted to it.|12/3/04|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/040/S40780.html|47|ndxe200411| SMALL ORANGE LIGHT - flew low over Hwy 78 and then South along I-15 (nearly overhead) with seemingly no visible craft attacted to it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was returning home from a Thanksgiving dinner at a friend&#39;s family house. That friend was driving while I rode in the passenger seat, looking out the window and just checking out the passing landscape while we talked.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were northbound on Interstate 15 at about 11:30pm. Just before we headed up the hill towards the city of Escondido, California, I spotted an orange light in the sky above the mountains. The reason it caught my eye is becaiuse the night sky was cloudy and the clouds were actually fairly low. So, I knew this light had to be very close to the ground. I looked at the horizon and quickly tried to determine whether or not what I was seeing was actually on a mountain or hillside on the horizon. As cloudy as it was, the light pollution was bright enough to darken the horizon and I could tell that this light was indeed in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Next, I tried to see if it was moving. At first, I couldn&#39;t tell because it was so far away. It could have been stationary, but after a few moments, not only could I tell that it was moving, I could tell that it was flying to the East. It appeared to be over State Highway 78.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The light seemed to slow and get brighter. It seemed to pick up speed, but I knew it may have been flying at the same speed, just now it seemed faster because it was actually coming our way. So, for this report, I wouldn&#39;t say it changed speed. I think it stayed pretty constant. As it got closer, I peered out the passenger window, as it was now off to the right side of the highway we were on.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I noted something strange. The light wasn&#39;t flying back West. I would have expected that if it were a plane coming in to land at a local airport. I live in this area and I know that there&#39;s a flight path leading back towards Palomar Airport. Planes sometimes circle over this area a take a Southwest bound approach towards the airport in Carlsbad, California. If a plane was making it&#39;s approach, the light should have cut back to the left and soon I should have spotted other lights. I should have seen a red or a green light, maybe a flashing light. I didn&#39;t. All I saw was a single orange light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The light flew directly South along the I-15 now, just off to the Eastern side of the highway. I watched it first out the right side of the windshield, and then out the passenger window. It wasn&#39;t over the highway, but close enough to it that it was about to pass us directly overhead in a few moments.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My next thought was that this must be a police helicopter. I&#39;m used to seeing a single red or a blue light, but not just a single orange one, so I tried to peer up at it as it passed overhead to see if I could make out a dark shadow of the craft&#39;s shape.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was also as it approached that I was able to tell that it was flying really low and at a good rate of speed. I compared it to the traffic coming at us in the opposing lanes, all the traffic traveling southbound along the I-15 on the other side of the center divide. The light seemed to be moving just as fast, if not just a tick faster. So, I&#39;d say somewhere bewteen 60-90mph.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It passed right by us and almost directly overhead. It passed a few blocks East of our position on the highway. With the low clouds and enough light pollution from the city of Escondido to make the clouds almost glow, I should have been able to make out a vague shadow of a craft attached to that light. We were definitely close enough now.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I could not. The light wasn&#39;t that bright, but even as low as the light was... that&#39;s all that appeared to be there. It was just a single orange ball of light up in the air.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I looked back over my shoulder as we passed the local ice arena. I couldn&#39;t believe what I just saw. I should have been able to see the shape of something, but all that I could see was a single orange light. I can&#39;t explain how I was able to tell that it was low, other than this. There&#39;s just something about the way you look at an object in the sky and if the background behind moves fast, then you know it&#39;s close. If it moves as slow or seems to hang with the background, it might be that far away. This light was moving by us, but there was enough of a contrast between it and the low clouds above it that I could tell it was fairly low.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My guess... I would say this was just 3 to 4 times above tree top level.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I don&#39;t know where it was going, but we were getting onto the 78 at this point and I no longer saw it behind us as the landscape soon obscured my line of sight with the light. I wonder how many other people may have seen it. I wonder if it had sound. I was traveling in a vehicle on the highway, so I have no way of knowing. The trouble is it really didn&#39;t stand out too much. The light wasn&#39;t very bright. It was about as bright as you&#39;d expect for a normal navigation light on a plane.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Probably the only reason I saw it was because I try to be more observant of these things now. I&#39;ve already had a couple of UFO sightings before. This wasn&#39;t the most specatular, but the fact that this was just a single light, with no apparent craft attached to it, was strange enough for me to post this here tonight.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I live directly under the flight path for Palomar Airport and I&#39;m accustomed to seeing aircraft flying overhead as they make their approached. I looked up in the distance and I saw one little light in the distance.  It was bright orange and appeared to be stationary or moving very slowly over highway 78. I was very puzzled what this could be? A plane or helicopter would have distinctive flashing lights, but this was just one orange light all by itself and no aircraft attached to it! After a minute the light seemed to drop in heighth and disappeared from my view heading in a southeast direction. I dont know if I saw a UFO, but it definitely was out of the ordinary and now I&#39;m going to look at the night skies a lot more and keep my camera handy!<n>

Please note that I am writing this on behalf of my 12 year old Son, normally I don&#39;t believe in these things (having never seen one) what was so convincing is how excited he was along with the youth worker (Ministry of Children and Family Services) I thought the two of them couldn&#39;t have possibly seen the same thing, if it was all made up!

It was about as far up as a small aircraft would travel. As it passed over it seemed to be standing still, I was standing next to a fire and it seemed to be watching what was going on. It had no blinking lights at all. It had no tail ,no wings,after a few seconds it continued on to the southeast and did not make a sound. It seemed to be quietly gliding on the air. The craft stopped right over my head as I had to tilt my head all the way back to see it. It was NOT an airplane.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I was driving westbound on I-80 freeway and turned off at Truxel Rd and was turning south (left turn), heading back over the freeway.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I straightened out the wheel, from the direction I just came from, I noticed a very bright unusual looking whitish amber colored light up in the sky. I estimate it was maybe 400 to 500 ft up. at about 35 degrees up from the horizon. At about a distance of a mile or so yet down the freeway. My first thought was its just a helicopter flying low over the freeway. Then I looked for the usual blinking marker lights around the big light which didn&#39;t look like anything I&#39;ve seen on a helicopter before. That&#39;s when things didn&#39;t add up in my estimations of distance and speed and relative size of a chopper. I could pretty much see that the light was too large for a helicopter at that distance and it was closing fast. The light itself was not the usual bright spot light, with its search light spot ray pointing downward. More like it was the entire craft itself.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I remembered I had my digital camera with me and realized I could take a picture of this thing. It was in its case and I become really excited as I fumbled with the bag losing precious seconds trying to negotiate a moving vehicle and open my camera case at the same time. I slowed down to maybe 10 mph from about the 20mph that I was up to crossing the overpass. By the time I got my camera out and rolled down my window so as to not get flash reflection, it had caught up to me, I stuck my camera out the window, turned it back behind me and up. I immediately saw the bright light in the view finder screen. Holding the camera with both hands and trying to keep it still I pressed the button but the flash didn&#39;t go off as I expected so I just thought it &#39;misfired&#39; and I pressed again. Neither time did I get a flash. I must have batteries too weak to fire the flash on my camera I thought and then it dawned on me that I didn&#39;t hear anything like a helicopter. This thing made No Sound! Then when I got home I pressed &#34;review&#34; on my camera and to my surprise it started playing back a video of what I saw and was trying to take a picture of. I had inadvertently captured 3 seconds of it in two very short movies of it. It turns out In my haste to get a picture I must have turned the mode selector button on my Kodak CX7300 past &#34;camera&#34; one notch to &#34;Video&#34; mode.  Although the video is shaky and brief you can slow it down in Quicktime by manually dragging the playback head back and forth to see the light&#39;s path overhead relative to tiny more stationary lights below it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I counted a total 22 frames of the object spread out over two seperate clips in a timeframe of 2.5 to 3 seconds. I actually saw it for almost 30 seconds total.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Note that my date on the file is correct the actual right time was never set on my camera.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
11/24/04 21:30|New York City (Manhattan)|NY|Light|0:45|Night-time sighting of UFO over Midtown NYC.  ((NUFORC Note:  Possible landing light on an airliner approaching local airport?  PD))|5/24/05|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/043/S43454.html|56|ndxe200411| Night-time sighting of UFO over Midtown NYC<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had just come from a gathering on West 38th Street and was walking back to my home on West 43rd up Ninth Avenue. As I reached 43rd I turned east towards 8th avenue. I live between 7th and 8th. Halfway down the block, I looked up into the sky, it was clear and I noticed a bright object making circles in the sky.  The light was a bright steady white.  I stopped and continued to watch as the circles that the object made tightened and at a speed that no air-craft I know of could make, not even a helicopter.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Let me say that it appeared that the object as far as I can tell was at an altitude of several thousand feet, so that the circles it was making encompassed at the beginning, I would say aproximately a mile or so in diameter and doing this in just a few seconds, as the circles it made became smaller perhaps several hundred feet were being covered.  And this is what convinced me that this was no ordinary plane.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I stood watching a man was walking towards me and I said out loud purposely to catch his attention &#34;Yes, no doubt about it, that is a U.F.O.&#34;  and I pointed.  But at that very   moment, before the man could turn around to look, it winked out!  And that was very strange.  Is it possible that this craft was aware of my observation of it from a relatively dark street below and did not want to be pointed out to others?<n> <n><n> <n><n> Have been interested in the subject of UFO&#39;s since childhood and this made me since that time a keen observer of the sky and what usually is in it.  This was like nothing  ever observed before and the nature of it&#39;s movement convinced me beyond a doubt that this was indeed an Unidentified Flying Object, since nothing I have ever seen or heard of when it comes to aircraft could have possibly duplicated what this object did.  That it was under intelligent control I have no doubt either.  Have seen balloons and other objects subject to wind currents many times in the sky, this was like neither of those.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Remarkable that far from being in a remote rural location this happened right over mid-town Manhattan!   Will submit a graphic image of the observation soon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Possible landing light on an airliner approaching local airport?  PD))<n>

The object would steadily and slowly move over the ocean and over oak island and frog island. The light would be bright and it would fade away. Whenever it would come back it would first be a little white light ,it would slowly move across where i was looking and then it would turn into a bright orangey light. This was over a period o an hour and a half and it may still have been there after i left. This is really hard for me to explain to you and totally new ground for me.

11/24/04 20:30|Antioch|CA|Fireball|15 minutes|3 fireballs dropping smaller balls of light seen in the north sky moving east over antioch california|12/3/04|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/040/S40760.html|58|ndxe200411| 3 fireballs dropping smaller balls of light seen in the north sky moving east over antioch california<n> <n><n> <n><n> e bright lights, red in color spaced equally apart. the lights were in a straight line at first moving in a upward and eastward direction. then the fist light stopped, and the other two continued on. they seemed to be dropping smaller balls of fire-like lights out of the bottom goig straight down. the dropped lights burned out shortly, about 5 seconds.  the two continued about halfway accross the sky moving higher as they went. one light stayed still for about 5 mins and dropped several of the little fireballs and them moved onward abruptly. a few moments later the light went out all together. the first one that had atayed in position slowly went out, like it burned itself out, slowly getting weaker and weaker. what would have been the middle light was still bright and strong and appeared to be very high in altitude, but still very bright. brighter than an airplane light or the brightest star in the night. the size of all three light were much larger than aircraft lights, like looking at a very big bonefire in the distance. the lights dropped from them were weaker in brightness, but you could clearly see the movement and the red glow. i would estimate they were at least as high as a comercial jet in the sky. this was whitnessed by my entire family as we were called outside by my uncle who was having a ciggerette break. every one coul;d clearly see the movement, see the lights stop and hold position and see the lights dropp the other small er lights out of the bottom. the ages ranged from 8-70years. the location was the backyeard of my granparents house in antioch california, looking towards the north. the lights traveled in a northeasterly direction. the entire event lasted 15 to 20 mins. the lights started very bright and and low and as they dropped thier loads they grew weaker in color and brightness untill they went out all together.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
11/24/04 20:00|Nevada (above; in flight; 37000 ft.)|NV|Unknown|40 Minutes|Starlike objects made impossible maneuvers while I was on a flight at 37000 feet|3/19/09|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/068/S68854.html|59|ndxe200411| Starlike objects made impossible maneuvers while I was on a flight at 37000 feet<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was on a United evening flight from Philadelphia to Los Angeles to have Thanksgiving at my girlfriend&#39;s parents&#39; home.  I was seated over the wing on the starboard side of a Boeing 767.  The captain had just come on the radio to say that we were flying over Nevada and knowing that we were getting close to our destination, I looked out the window over the wing staring at the millions of stars in the sky when I noticed one particular object that seemed to be moving with the aircraft at least 50+ miles (approximation) as it was visible just off the far edge of the wing.  I thought possibly this was simply an optical illusion, so I focused on another object only to watch it move to the rear of the wing and out of sight.  I then refocused on the moving object keeping pace with the aircraft when it suddenly had a burst of acceleration. Mind you we were flying at 380mph (I asked the pilot when we landed) and this object sped forward at least 4 to 5 times that speed because it was out of sight in less than a tenth of a second. I thought the event was over when the object came back on its same trajectory in reverse then moved forward at the same rate as the aircraft. It performed the same maneuver several times then shot straight up in a vertical motion at the same speed it used when it moved forward and backward. Only a few seconds later it returned in a downward trajectory at the same rate and stopped at the same altitude just off the wing. That&#39;s when I noticed two other objects performing the same maneuvers. It almost seemed like they were playing a game of &#34;catch me if you can&#34; moving upward, downward, forward and reverse in Nano seconds. It was an amazing sight to behold. I looked around to see if anyone else had noticed this event but most of the people on the flight were sleeping, or had their window shades closed. At one point all three crafts met stood at the same location for a minute or two, then without warning one moved forward, one moved rearward, and the third flew vertically. All t! hree cra fts were flying at well over 600 mph during the maneuvers. I was absolutely amazed by what I was seeing, three UFO&#39;s performing a series of maneuvers impossible to be normal, jet aircraft -- and of course being in very close proximity to Area 51. After approximately 40 - 50 minutes of maneuvers, all three craft took three different trajectories; up, forward and rearward and then they were all gone. It was an amazing event, and one I will not soon forget. This was only the second sighting I have had, the first in 1976 when I experienced a glowing, golden orb that followed my car at low altitude (approximately 50 feet) parked itself in the sky in front of my home, then landed in a field around the corner from my home (see August 15, 1976, Hatboro, PA). Just for the record, I do not drink alcohol when I am on an aircraft because it dehydrates your body. I drink 8 ounces of water every hour that I am on the flight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD))<n>

11/24/04 07:20|Allegan|MI|Unknown|1-2 minutes|Bright light/enormous aircraft hovering over Allegan County|12/3/04|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/040/S40784.html|61|ndxe200411| Bright light/enormous aircraft hovering over Allegan County<n> <n><n> <n><n> On 11/24/04, while driving south between Grand Rapids and Kalamazoo on US-131, I saw an extremely bright light in the western sky.  Its size and magnitude were 5 to 10 times greater than Venus, which is often visible in the eastern morning sky.  It was about 7:20 A.M. and I was between exits 59 and 55 (Shelbyville and Martin) when I viewed this light. It appeared to be lower than planes should fly. It remained stationary, apparently hovering. Within perhaps a minute I came parallel to it and passed it. Looking through my back window, I perceived its outline enough to know that it was the largest airborne object I&#39;ve ever seen and quite close.  (I&#39;m afraid that I&#39;d subconsciously invent details if I tried to describe what I THOUGHT its shape could have been.  All I can say with certainty is that it was long and immense.)  I called my fiancé on my cell phone and described the object to him. He said to call him back if I found out any information about it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I would have to imagine this object was seen by the other motorists on the highway with me. Realizing that my curiosity about this would probably be met with scorn or, at least, disinterest, I was hesitant to contact anyone. My curiosity bested me and I called Aeronautics in Lansing, but hung up in dismay over how to credibly word my inquiry. The next day I contacted the Allegan County Sheriff&#39;s Department. Their dispatcher said she had received no calls regarding this and suggested I call Dodgen Aircraft/Padgham Airfield. The gentleman I spoke to there also had no information.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My best guess is that it was some sort of military aircraft, although I have no idea why such a thing would be hovering over Allegan County. I have seen nothing about it on local news websites. Any information would be appreciated.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

WHILE ENGAGED IN CONVERSATION THE DRIVING OFFICER STOPPED THE VEHICLE IN THE MIDDLE OF THE ROADWAY AND ASKED ME TO LOOK TO THE NORTH AT A BRIGHT ORANGE LIGHT THAT WAS APPEARING OVER THE YUMA AREA. AFTER REALIZING THAT WE HAD STOPPED IN THE MIDDLE OF THE RAODWAY WE DECIDED TO MOVE APPROX. 1/4 OF A MILE UP THE ROAD PAST AN INTERSECTION TO STOP AT A CIRLCE K. AS WE EXITED OUR VEHICLE WE WERE APPROACHED BY TWO MALES SUBJECTS ON BIKE&#39;S ASKING WHAT THE FORMATION IN THE NIGHT SKY WAS. WHILE TRYING TO EXPLAIN OUR DISBELIEF SEVERAL OTHER WITNESSES INCLUDING THE CIRCLE K EMPLOYEE WALKED OUT AND OBSERVED WHAT APPEARED TO BE A V-SHAPE OR CHEVERON SHAPE FORMATION IN THE NIGHT SKY. THE FORMATION APPEARED TO HAVE BRIGHT GLOWING CIRCLES FOLLOWING THE SHAPE OF THE OBJECT. AS WE INVESTIGATED FURTHER THE OFFICER I WAS WITH ASKED OUR COMMUNICATION CENTER TO CALL OUR LOCAL MARINE STATION TO SEE IF THEY HAD AIRCRAFTS IN THE AIR. WE WERE ADVISED LATER THAT THE TOWERS WERE DOWN AND NOTHING WAS UP IN THE AIR, WE WERE ALSO ADVISED THAT NOTHING HAD APPEARED ON THERE RADAR SENSOR. THE OFFICER I WAS WITH IS A 22 YEAR RETIRED MARINE WHO HAS EXTENSIVE KNOWLEDGE OF AORCRAFT AND BY HIS OWN ADMISSION HE SAID THAT HAD NEVER SEEN SUCH TECHNOLOGY LIKE WHAT WE WERE LOOKING AT. THE OFFICER AND MYSELF STILL IN DISBELIEF GRABBED A SET OF BINO&#39;S. AFTER LOOKING AT THE OBJECT IT APPEARED TO HAVE SOME SORT OF VAPOR ADMITTING OUT OF IT. IT WAS LEAVING SOME SORT OF VAPOR TRAIL BEHIND THE OBJECT. AGAIN IT LOOKED TO BE V-SHAPED WITH BRIGHT ORANGE LIGHTS OUTLINING THE SHAPE. THE MIDDLE OF THE OBJECT WAS BLANK, THERE WAS NO FORMATION ABOVE THE LIGHTS AROUND OR BELOW. IT LOOKED LIKE A V WITH LIGHTS. AFTER SEVERAL MOMENTS I REALIZED THAT I NEEDED TO PHOTOGRAPH THE OCCURANCE. WHILE ATTEMPTING TO LOAD MY DIGITAL CAMERA THE OTHER OFFICER ADVISED ME THAT THE OBJECT WAS MOVING AWAY FROM US AT A MODERATE RATE OF SPEED. AS I LOOKED BACK THE OBJECT WAS ALREADY OUT OF MY VIEW. THE OFFICER THAT HAD CONSISTANCE SURVAILANCE SAID THAT HE COULD STILL SEE IT. AFTER ABOUT A 30 SECOUND DELAY HE SAID IT WAS OUT OF HIS VIEW. IT WAS AN EVENT ETHER ONE OF US HAVE EVER ENCOUNTERED. THE SHAPE LIFTED STRAIGHT AWAY FROM US UNTIL OUT OF OUR VIEW. IS THERE TECHNOLOGY OUT THERE LIKE THAT? THE OTHER OFFICER DESCRIBED THE EVENT AS BEING &#34;IN THE RIGHT PLACE AT THE RIGHT TIME, OR THE WRONG PLACE AT THE WRONG TIME &#34;, HE WENT ON TO SAY &#34; WE JUST SEEN SOMETHING I DONT THINK WE WERE MEANT TO SEE&#34;. WE ARE STILL UNSURE WHAT EXACTLY WE WERE LOOKING AT BUT THE EVENT IS SURE TO STAY WITH US A LONG TIME.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

As we approached the exit gate to the field we noticed  approx three objects in the sky. The sky was extremely black closest buildings to the field had to be at least 5 miles or so away in any direction. The objects were moving extremely quick with a burst of purplish - white light. The objects started out kind of ball shaped as they passed us they flattened out a bit. There was a quiet humming sound in the air as they passed us but hardly loud enough to hear. They must have been about maybe 1,000 feet up I guess. they flew out and up and then vanished against the black sky, everyone that saw it with me asked everyone else if they saw the same thing , everyone was a little weirded out to say the least , but the objects never stopped , but the fact  that sound was almost nothing really worked us up . It was pretty exciting to all of us. Im only 18 years old , and what I saw was not a joke , was not some Goverment thing , what I saw, waht we saw looked like something just passing through. The weirdest thing that happened was our radio got fuzzy and the truck seemed to was to go faster then slower then no where as the objects passed over<n>

It looked like a cross between white and grey, like the color of an airplane. At first I thought it was an airplane, but then a little puff of air came out of the back, and it shot forward. It was still in view, because I saw it over a wide open airport take-off place, and I continued to watch it, then my mother saw it. It seemed to turn around, then a little puff came out the back again, and it shot forward. It hovered in one spot for a long time, then floated out of view.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date of sighting is approximate.  PD))<n>

11/20/04 02:11|Boca Raton|FL|Unknown|45-60 Minutes|Sleeping Male Vanishes From Home Late AM  ((NUFORC Note:  Investigated by MUFON/Florida.  Report unconfirmed..  PD))|12/3/04|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/040/S40712.html|80|ndxe200411| Sleeping Male Vanishes From Home Late AM<n> <n><n> <n><n> At approximately 1:15 Am on 11/20/04 my wife &amp; I retired to sleep on the second level of of Boca Raton, Fl home after watching TV in our first floor den. As I often do, I put on our TV in our room which helps me to get to sleep. As I watched a National Geographic special I became groggy. Knowing that keeping the TV on all night bothers my wife, I grabbed the remote and switchd off the TV and quickly fell into a deep sleep. In what seemed an instant after doing so, I was awakend by my wife who questioned me as to &#34;where I was&#34;. My immediate response was &#34;in our bed&#34;.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My wife then explained to me that she awoke because she sensed that I was not in bed with her. She then stated that she searched the whole house and even walked to the guard house in her pajamas of our community to see if anybody had been permitted to drive to our residence to pick me up. She was told nobody had come into the community.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Upon her return, she burst into the room and found me in our bed. She stated that my car was in our driveway, and that my walllet, cell phone and money was just as I had left it in our kitchen when we went upstairs, which further upset her. She knows me well enough to know that if in fact I left our home for some reason, I would have taken these items with me. We do not live near any stores or establishments that one could walk to.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I awoke, she further explained that the covers in our bed on my side looked exactly as if I had pushed them down and left the bed. Realizing that she was not kidding, I informed her that I just turned off the TV and fell asleep. She then reconfirmed that she searched our entire residence and that I was not physically present.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I glanced at the clock and it was about 2:30 am when she stormed into our bedroom and awoke me with this shocking news.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I tried to comfort and console her at this point and confirmd that to my knowledge I had not left our bed, not even to use the bathrooom.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Not really sure what had happened, we went back to bed. When I awoke, I asked her to confirm what had happened and that either her nor I were dreaming. She confirmed it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Somehow, I do not think either of us actually accepted this event as reality because we awoke and did not talk about it. As a believer, I felt that I needed to let soembody know and help me to understand what might have happened. So I searched the web and found this site to report incidents. I called and was instructed to file this report as I am.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I consider myself of sane and sound mind and am a local business owner.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was also instructed to have my wife file an incident report which will be done first in the am. I am aslo willing to have this event scrutinized by any means required to validate it including onsite investigation, cameras, lie detectors anything.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It almost seems like something out of the Twilight Zone and I feel more confused than anything.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am not sure what really happened, the evidence has it that I was some how physicaaly missing form my home for 45-60 minutes without my knowledge.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was told to examine myself for any marks, and did not find any. However, from the base of my throat to the middle of my chest it is mildly red, as if I had been exposed to the sun. I can tell because when I press teh area, a brief mark apears such as when one gets a sunburn and presses the afected area with a finger. The rest of my body is unaffected.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I welcome any comments and or suggestions.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((ADDENDUM FROM MARY MARGARET ZIMMER, ASSISTANT STATE DIRECTOR FOR FLORIDA))<n> <n><n> <n><n> Sleeping Male Vanishes From Home Late AM<n> <n><n> <n><n> This report was submitted by the witness, ((name deleted)).

11/19/04 17:30|Orlando|FL|Sphere|2 minutes|Sphere of light descends, emitts blinding bright light across city, then shoots up back into atmosphere at light speed|12/3/04|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/040/S40737.html|84|ndxe200411| Sphere of light descends, emitts blinding bright light across city, then shoots up back into atmosphere at light speed<n> <n><n> <n><n> AT 5:30 AM on 11/19/2004, I noticed an object in the sky the size of a pea. (If I were to hold up a pea as high as I could and look directly at it.) It was a clear night but was still dark out. With no clouds to use as a reference, it was difficult to tell how far up in the sky this object was relative to where I was standing. I assumed at first it was a low flying aircraft on it&#39;s approach to the airport coming from the EAST. I thought this was an aircraft possibly in trouble due to the speed and angle of descent compared to most other aircraft that are approaching Orlando&#39;s airport. This object came to a sudden halt without making noise and hovered for about 3 seconds before separating into 3 pieces. It was more like the original object kept its size and shape,, but 2 objects broke off the sides of the sphere at the same time. The movement of both side objects was very symmetrical. These 2 objects left a weird trial of what seemed like smoke but was hard to tell. The larger original object never seemed to emit any trail or make any noise. What reminded me of booster rockets off of a shuttle or a multi staged rocket left me to believe at first that this was some sort of secret launch that went awry or a secret shuttle mission that launched however, I knew that all shuttle launches during take off execute a pitch and roll immediately out into the Atlantic so as to be far from land in the event of an emergency. Keep in mind,, I still don&#39;t know how far the object was in the sky relative to where I was. Even know I can see the shuttle burn from a day or night time launch from Orlando, the distance would be too far from the cape to see individual rocket boosters fall off. These 2 objects that broke off did not emit any light but the light from the Original object was enough to see these two objects separate from the original at the same time and leave a trail of what looked like white smoke. So far still no noise. Then, 3 seconds after the 2 mini objects broke off,,, a light so bright started to shine everywhere. It wasn&#39;t blinding like the sun,, however, it shined brighter. It lit up the whole sky and the neighborhood, brighter than the 12&#39;oclock sun. I stood still and was able to continue looking at the source of the light. The object was still in the same spot in the sky. I thought this was a nuclear blast of the air burst type however, the light kept shining for about 35 to 40 seconds. This light wasn&#39;t vibrating or sporadic,,, like you would see in fireworks,, or a flare or a meteorite in the sky. It maintained a constant candlepower without the strobing effect. I remember looking all around to see if this light was concentrated in a specific area. The whole sky and everywhere I looked,, this light was shinning. If it wasn&#39;t for me knowing where the object was in the sky,, it would of been hard to tell where the light source was coming from directionally since it appeared to be coming from everywhere. After what seemed like 40 seconds,, this light shrinked back to its source in the sky. The strange thing was that the brightness of the light remained the same while the area it was covering started to shrink back to the object. It took about 5 seconds from when it started shrinking, until all you saw was the object still hovering in the same spot in the sky. Then within a second, this object shot right back up into the atmosphere at what appeared like light speed. It left in the opposite direction, not directly up, more like up and eastward at an angle. The trail it left didn&#39;t appear to be smoke. It was more like the trail you would see if you waved a kem-lite in front of your face in the dark from left to right as fast as you can. It took off so fast without noise that it left a light trail for about 2 seconds. According to local radio stations and the local CBS TV affiliate, (www.local6news.com) hundreds of people in Orlando that were traveling to work or on the road reported the blinding light. Most witnesses said it lasted between 30 to 50 seconds. Some drivers were running through traffic lights because they couldn&#39;t tell if the lights were green or red. A meteor scientist from Brevard county on the east coast said he witnessed the object that morning and gave coordinates that put the object directly above OIA. (Orlando International Airport)<n>

It was around 10 p.m. PST in Gaston, Oregon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were sitting on her bed looking out her window to the East hills when just above the hills we saw 3 lights.  They seemed hover for a bit in a triangular form but then they started moving randomly.  One dropped vertically quickly then moved to the South on the horizontal like a right angle.  This really surprised me.  I have never seen anything move this smoothly or quickly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The lights changed colors as well.  We saw them become red, blue, green and whitish/yellow.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I must say my behavior changed dramatically for a couple days following the event.  I don’t know if this has anything to do with what we saw or not but thought I would note it.<n>
11/18/04 20:45|Sequim|WA|Unknown|45 seconds|deep, throbbing, sound heard; nothing sighted|12/3/04|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/040/S40697.html|87|ndxe200411| deep, throbbing, sound heard; nothing sighted<n> <n><n> <n><n> I would like to know if anyone else noticed this.  Last evening (November 18)  at approximately 8:45, I began to hear, over the sound of a radio broadcast on my computer, a wierd, deep, almost physical, &#39;thrumming&#39; noise.  I muted the computer and could hear it somewhat better.  I stepped out onto the back porch to see if I could locate where it was coming from or see anything.  My dog stepped out with me.  It seemed to be receeding as we stepped out,  but it was coming from somewhere overhead. My dog, who was hoping that she was going to get to run off a racoon, stopped mid-stride and immediately assumed a &#39;Down&#39; poslture.  She looked straight up, however, from this position.  She appeared  afraid to move for a few moments. My husband stepped out onto the porch but the sound had faded away by then.  I and my dog are the only ones that heard it but it was very strange.  It had the same sort of pressure/air pushing  sound that a Chinook helicopter makes when you hear it coming off in the distance.  However, it was very much slower than the sound of rotor blades. And, it was different from a Chinook sound in that it seemed much, much, bigger.  It actually scared me a little and I&#39;m not a fearful person.It was a clear night but, from my vantage point, at least, there was nothing to be seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I was the first one to see them and told my wife to quick come over and look at what I see. We saw three very fast moving lights when we first saw them they looks like they started at the same point on the horizon moving in a erratic (from left to right and up and down while moving north to North east and out away from earth pattern they looked like they came from the pacific down south of us and was moving from left to right and the two lights on the left took turns taking the lead and the 3rd light moved more to the south east and out and as the other two went more north and out I say they went out because the lights looks like they got smaller but still did not move in a straight line within 4 minutes the lights seemed to fade into the background of space. My wife and I were so freaked out we came inside to turn on the TV.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I stopped to get the mail and noticed lights in the sky above.  There were four separate round lights in sort of a circle formation. They were sort of low (below the clouds and well below an airplane that was passing very high in the sky at that time.  They moved counterclockwise incredibly fast and then moved in, toward each other and then away-almost like a dosedo in a square-dance. There was no sound. I then noticed another set of lights over my neighbors house about one hundred and fifty feet away.  Those four lights were doing exactly the same thing.  I thought it must be some reflection of some gizmo on the ground.  But I live on 11 acres.  My neighbor has ten acres.  My neighbor on the other side has 55 acres.  And behind us in a 30 acre preserve.  I could see nothing that would be causing this phenomenon. I began to drive down my road-which is a private road about two-tenths of a mile in distance to my house.  I noticed the left set of lights seemed to be following right above my car. I was in a panic and quickly turned around and sped back to the top of the driveway.  I tried to dial the police on my cell phone but I was not able to get it to work.  My cell phone always works at my property.  I used to have AT&amp;T wireless and switched to Verizon because it always works where I live.  In fact, before I had stopped to get the mail, I had just been on the cell phone.  I didn&#39;t know what else to do, so I went to my neighbor who also had those lights above her house, but whose driveway was much closer to the main road.  I skeed her to come outside and asked her if she knew what those lights could be.  She was freaked out and in disbelief.  I want you to know that my neighbor and I are both lawyers, and neither of us are prone to believing anything other than hard evidence.  We chatted for awhile both agreeing that there was nothing we could think of that could explain what we were seeing.  I joked that if I get beamed up, she would at least be able to explain my disappearance to my husband.  I finally got up the nerve to race down my driveway and into my garage, and I thought, that was the end of that.  I have absolutely no knowledge or experience with UFO&#39;s.  But the next day, my cell phone would not work..anywhere.  I finally removed the battery and waited an hour.  When I replaced it, the phone worked.  As I thought more about it, I decided to check the internet to see if anyone else had reported seeing the lights.  I was chilled to read some similar accounts of fast dancing white lights in formation, though not at the same time or place.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

As I looked up and saw it, I noticed something out of the corner of my eye. It appeared very small and very high. I had trouble making out its shape but felt fairly confident that it was moving too slow to be an airplane. Since I could not make it out with my naked eye, I went and got my camera with digital zoom. It took me a while to focus in on it because it was so small. Once I was able to zoom in I recored two circular shaped objects. They seemed to be connected but their distance from each other changed and their orientation changed often. They never were very far from each other. I was able to tape about a minute worth and then lost them. Other jets were flying around so I know it was not jet propelled - at that height there would have been a condensation trail. Very curious -co-workers looked at the tape and agreed it seemed unusual. One guy told me about some people in Orlando area seeing something yesterday - don&#39;t know if that is true.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was so close to me that I could throw a golf ball at it and hit it. When I rolled down my window to watch it as it passed right in front of me, it did not make a sound of noise, it kept heading west over a small hill until i could not see it any more.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

My Mom, Dad, and sister were all outside on the front pourch. Its was already dark because it was like 6. but anyway i asked them what they were doing and the said that there is a circle in the sky about this size O or a little bigger. I looked at it and it was changing colors, like lights were blinking on it red green and blue. It didnt move for a whole hour just sat there we watched it the whole time. We also had binoculars so it made somewhat a little more definite. after about the first hour we notice that it was going South East very very slow. when it got to a certain point it just turned white and we noticed another small one below it, It was doing the exact same thing but it was a little fainter, this one was following the exact some path that the bigger one took. The bigger one after a while started to look like a star like it was disguising itself as a star becasue it had stoped changing color and was just white. We didnt watch it long enough to see if they disapered or anything. But we have never seen any stars out that way or that low and my dad constatnly looks out that way because he watches the planes come in. He is the one who spotted it first. personally i think it was a good siting, but not a very active one. except for the blinking lights<n>

There were several amber lights in a row.  It appeared to be 2 separate objects because of the distance apart.  The lights went on and off in some sore of pattern.  I watched as I was driving and the lights continued going on and off in a pattern of sorts.  I slowed way down (I was only going about 30mph just after an exit ramp) to look closer and the lights just went out.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It quickly seemed to move off horizontally in a westerly direction, as we drove southbound away from it. It looked like it may have been about 500 - 1000 ft. high and about a mile or so distant from our position. It&#39;s possible it could have been a helium balloon, but it looked round and seemed to travel quite quickly, despite the apparent lack of wind. I lost sight of it as we continued driving further away. I looked at my watch and noted the time and also the location of where we were at so that I could report it.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

At first i thought i was watching the international space station.  The light was one of the brightest stars in the sky but moving just fast enought o realize it was not a star.  Then i realized the light could not be the space station because it was going the wrong direction.  I followed it while driving and then it just disapeared.  It was as if it had moved far enough to the west to not be illuminated by the sun.  The light was about 45 gedrees high and moving in a straight line.  It did appear that the color was constant, a white/blue color.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It caught my eye as I was on the phone staring out my window.  Then I saw lights blinking from it making me think it was a plane.  Then I realized that it&#39;s not moving much, if at all.  The lights were blue and red and white as far as I could tell.  At first it looked as if it was about one thousand feet high in a mostly clear sky.  Seemed to be hovering there for the longest time and then took a very slow northwest direction.  It was too fast to be a star, too slow to be a plane and a helicopter just didn&#39;t make sense because it was to high and for too long to be searching for someone without a searchlight.  I called the local news and tried calling the airport.  I walked outside to get a better view to see if the window could&#39;ve been causing the blinking/twinkling effect, but the lights were still blinking with an unobstructed view.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I remember seeing a couple flashes of light in the star field and being frustrated.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I said to myself &#34;come on now lets not play hide and seek&#34; just then I spotted what looked like two saucer shaped craft at about thirty thousand feet. They were huge I could make out lights emanating out from the edges, while coming to grip with the fact that I am looking at real UFOS suddenly through my field of view at about five hundred feet flew a totally silent black triangle. I only saw it for a moment because I was looking through the binoculars and it was so close. At this point I put down the binoculars and went down to my mothers apartment to tell her whats over the roof I think she was concerned that I was going crazy. Sitting in amazement over what I had just seen I started to feel frightened, cotton mouth, heart racing, the works it felt like I was being probed while sitting in that chair. My mother calmed me down and I gained my composure back, I said to myself no more star gazing tonight!. The following night I called my sister to talk about the event, she is a spiritual healer (healingthehologram.com) I told her that I felt like the aliens probed me. She told me to ask what the alien called itself the name Ether came to my mind weird!. We talked for hours till 9pm and I felt much better. As I hung up the phone I looked up and out the skylight and this time gliding at about 200 feet and 20mph rotating slowly was another huge silent triangle with orange plasma round lights on each corner, there is no doubt that they knew I was looking at them, it flew directly over head then turned 90 degrees and flew off WOW up close and personal!<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous;  provides no contact information.

It was about 7:15 pm. Still sitting in the driveway, I looked out of my window - northern horizon. I saw 2 golden glowing lights that I thought was an airplane. I said to my daughter, &#34;Look at that airplane!&#34; She turns her head to look, the light on the left dims and disappears, then just as it disappeared another appeared directly over the remaining light on the right. Then I said &#34;What are those planes doing?&#34; At that time my daughter and I both saw the upper light dim and disappear, the final light instantly disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We can see the beautiful night sky each night and we see lots of planes, meteors etc. But the location of these lights were out of the ordinary.

The reason for taking 7 fotos is that, I just want to prove wht i saw was something strange, and not a photoshop edited.  But I cudn&#39;t upload da fotos right away, because, back in 2004 in country like Myanmar (burma), most people don&#39;t know what Internet really is, and the dial-up speed is super slow.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I shud have post them a few years ago, when i moved out of my country, but I couldn&#39;t find these files...but today I got them back fortunately, and i&#39;m sending them to you guys.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;m not so sure wht exactly is in these fotos, but i believe, these fotos tht i provide you, will help you with your study of UFO.

Right after the launch the camera went back to the B52 for about 3-4 minutes.  During this time there was a black circle hovering in and out of the frame right next to the plane.  It would come in from the right of the screen and hover near the front of the plane and next to/ under the wing.  Then after a few seconds would go off screen, then return again.  This lasted about 3-4 minutes.  The commentators said nothing about it, they must have seen it.  Maybe it&#39;s nothing, but it&#39;s worth looking in to.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We looked at the video, and the object appeared to us to perhaps be a fly, walking on the inside of the cockpit of the chase/photography aircraft that photographed the launch of the X-43a.

This is not unusual because there is an active airfield on base, however as the lights got closer I noticed that the aircraft looked different than the regular military aircraft.  I pulled over to the side of the road and got out of my vehicle, so I could observe the craft in more detail.  The craft was approximately 3000 to 5000 feet in altitude.  It was triangular in shape, and the entire bottom of the aircraft glowed a dull hazy orange with about 6 or 8 brighter orange lights on the exterior of the craft.  The brighter lights were not strobing as are typical with normal aircraft.  While observing the craft it seemed to slow down and hover directly overhead.  I would guess that it was about the size of a large jet fighter or perhaps a little bigger.  No sound was coming from the craft, which would not have been the case with a typical helicopter or jet aircraft.  After 20 to 30 seconds the craft again began to move southward.  At that point, I got back into my vehicle and proceeded north 300 to 400 meters when I noticed a second person pulled off to the side of the road, out of his vehicle, and observing the same craft.  I am a physicist who has worked on the naval base for 15 years and have never observed a craft like that before.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It had no wings, no lights, but appeared to be a smooth circle--may have been bottom of a craft.  As it hit the edge of a cloud a big reflectiion from the sun shot out momentarily.  The craft then started to move slowly upwards (about 10-20&#39;) when strange dark straight lines appeared next to it.  I then realized it was approaching the bottom of another much larger craft--the lines were part of the larger ship.  The larger craft was completely invisible to the eye from where I was except for the lines.  The circular craft proceeded to enter a dark, cloud-edged opening and on into the ship and all disappeared. --ss<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date of sighting is approximate.  PD))<n>

The sound was in my head, i asked my friend after and he confirmed that he had heard the same. The object was hovering and started moving away as a jet approached from behind, i knew it was a jet as it was much smaller than a passenger plane.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We watched the chase and discussed what we had seen, it was strange that when I got my mobile phone out to film the object, my battery went.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There were reports of strange lights in the skies in the area the same week.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Cheers<n>

This hum was even inside of me like a great vibration.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I heard my 13-year-old daughter scream and I ran into her room. Her light was off and she was sitting up in bed with the blinds open and said that something flew by her window with a long white light following it that caused the whole sky in front of her to turn white. It then flew up into the sky and disappeared. She said, it made everything in the sky white.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I looked outside and only got to see the stars and nothing else.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I then asked her a few more questions and from that, she said that she felt a hum in her body and sat up, which is when she saw the &#34;big thing&#34; fly by and the white light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Our neighbors felt the hummmmm but didn&#39;t see the lights because their apartment sits in front of the building and not in the back like ours.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Placerville, California ia 42 miles east of Sacramento and 50 miles west of Tahoe on Highway 50.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I&#39;m not even sure if my date is that accurate, but I do recall it being around winter time...<n> <n><n> <n><n> My friend and I were on my way to my brother&#39;s house, when he noticed an orange ball drop into the atmosphere.  At the time he pointed it out, I thought it was a street light, because it appeared to be the same color as one, but soon noticed that it went from hovering to moving at an exceptionally fast speed to our left.  We followed the ball for a mile or so and saw that we were actually gaining on it until we ended up behind a grocery store.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was very clear that we were much closer to the orange ball now.  It appeared about half dollar size from our viewpoint and was hovering over a patch of trees.  It moved closer to us (what seemed a very gradual speed) until it was right above my friend&#39;s parked car and much lower to the ground.  The thing seemed only a matter of feet above us, and had a bright orange light in the middle with blue-ish lights surrounding.  It hovered over us for some minutes, and made no sound at all.  It shortly took off with such a speed, that neither my friend nor I could recall which direction it left in.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There were a series of strange occurrences that my friend and I experienced throughout the next several weeks, but I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s relevant to our experience, as we were experiencing some paranoia.  I developed what seemed like scratches on the back of both of my shoulders (in semi-symmetrical lines of 4), but they seemed to be under my skin, as I could not feel them.  They lasted over a week and vanished.  My friend and I both awoke to doors slamming when we were home alone, with no explanation.  My friend also claimed to develope the scratches some weeks later, but I didn&#39;t get to see them before they went away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.

By the time we were about a mile from the object we assumed it to be some sort of aircraft from Ellsworth AFB. We quickly changed our minds when the odject appeard to be Three lights aranged in a tri-angle, The lights looked like a very large street light except that there was a dark body behind the lights and it appeared to be hovering at about 1500 to 2000 feet, which Helocopter pilots dont like to do becouse they loose ground effect.  So we drive untill we are undernieth the object at which point were really freaked out we roll the windows down to confirm that its not a helo/ Harrier/ JSF X-plane Ect. and no sound was heard besides road noise, my friend sits on the door and looks over the top of the truck at the object and i Look out my open window to confirm that its not a reflection or any thing else. At this point we are driving about 60 mph next to a commercial truck whose driver looks at me with this wild expression as we both look back at the object it moves slowly tward the north and then just kind of winks out of view. To this day it is the only thing like it that i have ever seen, wether it was something from Ellsworth or not I dont know, I just thought that I should let somebody know.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.

It crossed the sky horizontally over the mountain and I stopped seeing it when it whent behind a low cloud.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I would like to say that this isn&#39;t the only sighting I&#39;ve seen.

The objects seemed as if they were chasing each other ~ at one point they were lined up ~ the 3rd object caught up to the 2nd object leaving 2 objects visable.  Then the 2nd object caught up to the 1st object which left one object in the sky.

Anyways, we were on our way back home coming down Main ST which turns into Hwy 107. We were on our way down the hill in town in the 25MPH zone. We were approaching the bridge which turned into a 35mph zone. My Dad was driving and I just happened to look up through the moon roof(slightly tinted) and saw a silver, round shaped craft above the vehicle. It wasn&#39;t hude or anything but it was hard to tell how big it was since I couldn&#39;t tell how high it was away. But by the looks of it and amount of detail, it was very very close...I thought a few hundred feet tops.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had to make absolutely sure it wasn&#39;t a relfection or something off a pop can in the car or something so I opened the moon roof completely and there it was....in plain sight. I quickly looked at my Dad and told him to look above the truck. He had a big smile on his face when he saw it, but he focused more on keeping the vehicle on the road. I watched this craft float side to side and doin small curved motions from the right side of the vehicle to the left...then back a ways...then zip forward. From underneith the craft I saw what looked like segmented plates, piled on top of each other. It zipped around above our car from Main ST to Hwy U which I think is like 4-5 miles...maybe more. But anyways, this craft followed us right outta town into the 35mph zone....around a big curve where this road basically turns back into a highway and then around another curve into a 45mph zone, and around another curve into a 55mph zone. I couldn&#39;t see any markings or anything..but I could see the segments very clearly...and the very bottom segment looked more like a thimble than a smaller plate. As we turned on Hwy U towards home, I whipped around in my seat and looked out the back window only to see this craft flying about 80-90 feet above the ground, altering its course about 45 degrees to the left(West). This is when I could say that, if this craft didn&#39;t change altitude, then it was about 20-22ft in diameter max, and about 12-15ft in height in the center max. The craft made absolutely no noise. I am very very curious to know how many other people saw the craft above our vehicle that day, as there were other vehicles on the road that day. It was still pretty much completely light out at the time this event took place. I am sending a mspaint picture I whipped up of what I saw through the moon roof the entire time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Also, the roof was completely open just as a reminder, so it wasn&#39;t a reflection.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.

I was looking at the ground when I noticed this bright light on the ground moving towards me, so I looked up and the next door house, which was empty, poured out this bright light. It was all lit up like a huge spotlight was on the other side of the house. Then I looked over the house and it appeared that an object was hovering above and a couple houses down.  It was a noiseless, barrel shaped object with a white glowing end.  It looked like it was white kind of like the space shuttle.  It made this &#34;chh&#34; sound like the special effect sound of the astronaut jet packs right before it disappeared right before my eyes.  I wondered if I should go out and look for it when I had 2 very strong thoughts: 1: They&#39;re not here for me and 2: You have to go back to sleep.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The next day I told my boss of it and either that day or the next he emailed me an internet news report from the local station WNDU out of South Bend, IN that said crop circles had been reported in the next county:  Cass County.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

It was coming in and out of the cloud cover and covered about 1/3 of the sky in under less than a minute.  It appeared to be about a mile up, and my guess it was about 30 feet wide. It did not fly exactly straight, and at times changed course to avoid something. It was not eratic in motion.  Many craft have been seen in this area like this, but this is the first early morning one that I have seen. Definitely not a &#34;morning star&#34; or airplane.<n> <n><n> <n><n> To note, I am a medical professional, and am drug tested annually.  I never have done drugs, and very rarely drink.  This is not the ravings of some mad-man. The object was basically this shape:      ____ {____}<n>

I heard nothing.  From the time I realized this I started counting seconds.  I counted approximately 40 seconds when it was out of sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The morning was completely overcast and the flashes were very low in the sky.

The second I saw this I got chills and was freaked out. I was out stargazing when this happened. There was three craft. Perfect triangles. They were grey. No detail could be seen, even through binoculars. They had no lights. No sound. When I stargaze, planes go over at 10,20,30 thousand feet and I can always hear them. But these were silent. I read some other reports from seattle and these seem the same except for the lights. They were in my field of view for 10 seconds and went from west to east. They flew a perfect straight line. I saw no turns. I was a air traffic controller in the navy til about two months ago. I know my planes very well and this scared me. I have no idea what they could have been. I know speeds and know about the sound barrier. But they sure were close to it if not over it.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I noticed some lights out of my drivers side window, they were almost right above us. It was a little cloudy outside so all i could see was the lights, like they were right above the cloud cover.They were circles of lights and they were spining in opposite directions of each other and made up one big disk like shape. At first I thought that they were just some lights from town from an advertisement or something, but the more we drove through town we realised that the spinning lights were staying right above my car, off the the side, up in the sky.  I got scared and said that it was following us. My boyfriend said that there was nothing to worry about, but I was so scared that I  pulled over into a store parking lot, and of course there was noone else around that i could ask if they saw the same thing.  But as we sat there, I looked out my front window and it was right above us lingering in the clouds.  I got so scared I took off, and left town.  I was doing about 80mph and it was still following us.  My boyfriend said that he saw something black flying in front of it, but couldnt make out what it was.  It stopped following us as soon as there was no more cloud cover.  A lot of people ask me what kind of drugs I was on. and it hurts my feelings, because I KNOW what I saw and it WAS following my car. Hopefully someone else has had a similar experience and believes my story.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Silent, no engine noise.  Initial altitude approx twice that of small airplanes.  (We live near two small airports; planes were in the air at the time, could hear one engine off to the west)  The spheres were shining dull/opaque orange, fuzzy, somewhat like chinese lanterns.  Their formation was very rigid intially.  They gained altitude (got smaller &amp; dimmer) as they progressed south over the ocean off Point Mugu Naval Airstation.  The two spheres then seemed to close the gap between them, while the front sphere appeared to stretch the formation upward.  As the formation dimmed in the distance, the front sphere appeared to shoot upward. The rear two spheres stayed together and drifted in a more westerly direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Conditions were dark evening, very clear starry night. Just finished looking at the moon off to the west and was heading inside when the formation drifted into view from over my house.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When they were closest to me, I got the impression (not clear vision) I was seeing in through a round, riblike structure.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first sight I yelled to my son to get his video camera.

This light was not normal with any aircraft that we have ever seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Light was not seen again until approx. 30 seconds later and appeared forward many miles ahead of us and 10 degrees to the left. Observed another few secounds then notified air traffic control.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Air traffic controls reply &#34;no aircrafts forward or above our area over the next 125 miles&#34;.  Other air carriers were asked by air traffic control for any unsusual white lights. 2 others reported seeing the white light which was now south west of us over 90 degrees in less then 30 seconds. (This type of movement was extremely fast). I know of no aircraft able to move in this manner or switch directions so quickly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Light was again gone after an estimated 4 pulses. Appeared again south of us, northwest of RAP vor at 01:28z. Pulsed three times , never saw it again. Air traffic control gave us 2 phone numbers for the UFO hotline.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with this witness on several occasions, and we find him to be exceptionally credible.  He is attempting to have the 1st Officer on the flight submit a report, as well.  PD))<n>

While I was watching, 3 or 4 similar objects flew in from different compass points to join the first, they then seem to form up and flew west and disappeared. It was difficult to see any lights as they moved quickly, but a red light on the first craft might have been visible, although very dim.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

On 11/13/04 at around 10pm to 10:30pm, I was passing through Circleville, OH on my way to Ohio Furnace, OH. As I neared Circleville I noticed three bright, fire colored orange lights lined up in a row. They were front to back from my point of vission. Very quickly however, the lights went out one at a time from back to front. The best way I could describe this is to have you imagine three radio tower lights on a mountain, and a cloud comming from behind at a brisk pace and obscuring them. Anyway, the lights proceded to come on, and go out repeatedly, never showing in the same location twice, and never together again either. This made it very difficult to count them. I can say for sure there were three, but there could have easily been more. I didn&#39;t stop, but watched this &#34;weird&#34; occurance until I could no longer see the lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My question is did anyone else witness this, and is there any military installations around this area?<n>

I witnessed the &#34;red lights&#34; on 10/31/04 from Frankfort, Illinois, and since then, I have been watching the skies at night whenever it was possible.  I saw a ball shaped object in the Northeast sky that was flickering between red and white lights, it was a super fast flicker, and it rotated where the flickering came from on the object.  It would flicker in one spot, and then a second later in another spot, but on the same object, traveling at the same speed.  I don&#39;t know how else to describe it.  I called my husband (in Frankfort), and asked him to look, he was unable to see it.  I watched it travel east until I couldn&#39;t see it anymore, (only because I was driving, and literally couldn&#39;t view it anymore, but I don&#39;t know if it disappeared).  Minutes later, while still on my phone with my husband, it came into view again, this time traveling from the east to the west.  It was the exact same object, traveling at the same speed.  Again, I lost view of it in the western sky only because I was driving, and couldn&#39;t watch it and drive safely.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I know it seems weird that I have observed something again, but obviously something is going on, and it has peaked my interest to observe and watch the skies whenever I can.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was a clear evening, no clouds in sight. Both my brother and I were outside talking, and looking up at the sky. I stopped in middle sentence and asked my brother &#34;what is that&#34;, with sheer excitment in my voice. We both saw something flying overhead. At first my brother thought they might be geese flying overhead because of the V pattern.  I grabbed my binoculars and noticed that this was a craft of some sort. This object appeared to be gliding with no sound.  It seemed to be a large craft flying at an altitude of 1000ft. It was a Vshaped object with what appeared to be white circular lights, I would say maybe three on each side with one at the point of the V. The lights were not bright at all, very dim glow.   It was heading in the eastern direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is one of three sightings I have seen in the past year.  A few months ago my sister, brother, and I were outside and saw a circular craft, this also had a dim glow to it, and last year I saw a grey triangle craft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I now keep my eyes to the sky every night waiting to see what type of craft I&#39;ll see next.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

At least nine (9) that my dad and I counted.  I was watching just joking with him, &#34;hey i bet theres a ufo or something.&#34;  But it was not funny, out of the sunset sky glowed an intense bright red orb. However, it slowly faded away to the point where it was no longer visible and then it slowly returned to its intense light.  It then slowly faded away again and never came back. When the light faded, there was no object visible like any craft of any saort, it just was like an orb slowly fading away and back.

The night after the first day I went home and downloaded the pictures I took to my computer.  As I was going through the shots to see which ones I was going to delete, I noticed a small bright, white spot that appeared over an F-16 Thunderbird jet.  The picture was not that great and I was going to delete it, but decided the more that I looked at that little bright white spot the more I realized that it just didn&#39;t look right.  So I decided to take a closer look at it.  I zoomed in on it and when I did, it became more interesting.  I went through the process of trying to figure out what it wasn&#39;t (dust, lens flakes, etc) and after scratching my head, was left with the thought of what it might be.  The accompanying photo is what I captured on file - you decide?<n>

Its shape was rectangular, with a dark line dividing it in half, almost like a kite. At first its color was a faint blue. It did not move in a straight line, its trajectory was erratic, dipping and rising quickly back up. It flew close to the horizon. About five minutes after it vanished, it came back again, traveling north to south like it had before. At first, it was rectangular and blue like during its first passing, but the &#39;kite-like&#39; appearance changed to a simple white star-like point, and continued south. Either its appearance was distrupted by the atmosphere (though the sky was clear), or it changed shape.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

My luck i had a camera in my hands because it was too fast to go in to get the camera. It was cloudy and the top of the craft was in the cloud but i saw the bottom and the lights, 2 white lights and in the front was a red one. If you want a picture contact me in e-mail ;). Feel free. As i am writing this my pictures have not devoloped yet, but i will get them tomorrow. I can&#39;t wait! I hope this picture does not come out bad ;). Ok sorry about that now back to the ufo stuff.

I noticed that it was slowly moving so my next inclination was to think that it was a plane as we live only a few miles froma small airport.  But it was moving much too slowly to be a plane so close to us.  I called my husband&#39;s attention to it.  It would stop moving then move a little and so on.  Then it SHOT off....gone just like that.  It was gone so quickly that I thought it had to have been covered up by a fast moving cloud.  But I looked around at the sky and there were no clouds.  It was weird.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

The sun was shining and there were a few clouds in the sky, a very nice day.  I was looking northeast from the car.  My husband stopped for a red light at Broadway and Transit Rd...and that&#39;s when I saw it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I spotted an object, elongated like a cigar, which appeared to be metal, silver in color, the sun shining on it.  There was no sound at all that I could hear and I didn&#39;t see any windows or wings.  It traveled in an southeasterly direction.  I then spotted a plane traveling northwest and I thought they would collide, but the plane crossed in front of it.  I wondered if the pilot saw this thing.  The cigar shaped object traveled slowly and steadily......then suddenly stopped in midair for a second, then moved in the direction from which it came.....no turning or anything.  I couldn&#39;t take my eyes off it.  I had never seen anything like it in my life.  My husband continued north on Transit Road and I kept my eyes on the object.  By now I was babbling like a maniac.  Then it stopped again for a second, and moved again from where it came.......I kept my eyes on it as we traveled....and I saw it once again stop and start traveling again..but then we were so far I couldn&#39;t keep track of it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Continuing on to Main Street, I noticed before and after the doctor appointment that there were quite a number of planes in the sky, with their white exhaust trailing after them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am thoroughly puzzled and amazed.  I don&#39;t know of anything that moves in the sky, stops in midair, then goes in the opposite direction, without turning.  My husband suggested it was a blimp, but even blimps have to make a turn to go in the opposite direction, don&#39;t they?  He didn&#39;t see it at all because he had his eyes on the road going north.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It most certainly was NOT a balloon, nor a blimp.  It had no wings.  I can&#39;t determine its altitude, but as I recall, the plane looked a bit larger and I could see the plane had wings.  That&#39;s about all I can remember about it, but I can&#39;t forget it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> An internet friend of mine who lives in Canada said that the next day she also saw something in the sky that looked like what I described.  She lives in Stoney Creek, Ontario, but I&#39;m not sure if she was in Stoney Creek at the time she saw it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date of sighting is approximate.  PD))<n>

I immediately went back in and got a co worker to come outside and look at the fighter jets making contrails...As I was counting the fighter jets (I counted (8) eight within relatively close proximity, My co-worker says &#34;What is that??&#34;  I look up and see a PERFECT Circle (appeared to be Silver); Going VERY, VERY Fast - Probably 3 or 4 times faster than the jets... We continue to ask each other what it is as it fly&#39;s across the sky taking only about 20 seconds to fly over head and into the distance where we could no longer see it.  My co-worker and I agree we had never seen anything like it before ...It didn&#39;t have wings, and it didn&#39;t leave a contrail like the fighter jets; The 8 fighter jets in the sky seemed to excititedly change course shortly after it passed by... I was almost as impressed with the number of fighter jets as I was with the flying object... I have never reported a sighting like this before in my entire life.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

There is a large Bayer factory next to the highway, and in the distance, past the smoke stack, I could see the object in front of some clouds.  It looked like it was really far off in the distance, however it was very distinct, anyone looking could have seen it.  The airport is some distance away further north, so I am not ruling out it was an airplane.  But, it didn&#39;t look like it was moving.  After I changed lanes by about Front Street, I could not see it anymore.  Just seemed strange, I could not see any lights on it, the whole thing just seemed to reflect in the morning sun.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It looked like a bird, but it wasnt moving at all,and it was kinda far so it was hard to tell exactly how large it was. I saw it for like 3 seconds, and i pointed it out to my girlfriend, but when she look it disappeared behind the clouds. Then 30 seconds later i saw it again and i pointed it out to her. We looked at it for another 15 seconds, but then the train kept going and it either disappeared behind some clouds or a building we went by.(i dont remember exactly) There were other people on the train, but they seemed to keep to themselves as i was pointing it out to my girlfriend. They might have noticed me pointing it out but nobody else looked up to see as far as i know. There were only a couple people by us who would have noticed. San Fransisco has a lot of hills, so i contemplated it being the top of a very tall light or electric post on a hill, but i saw nothing under it, and it was pretty high up,in front of the clouds, i would estimate 500 ft? But i am really bad at estimating, so i could be wrong. I also would like to stress that they were clouds, and not the fog San Fransisco is so commonly used to.<n>

My brother, cousin and I were aboard my fishing boat. It was late in the evening and we were returning to port after spending the entire day fishing. I was steering the boat and the other two were out on deck when I suddenly heard them screaming exciting. At first I thought they spotted a whale shark but my brother came running up to the captains house screaming ‘look at that thing off of the portside. I quickly exited and noticed a cylinder shaped object about ½ mile from us protruding from the water. It was sticking straight out of the water about 45-50 feet and looked to be about 4 feet wide. The object quickly disappeared under the water and reappeared a few seconds later closer to my vessel. It elevated to the height of 60-70 feet within 5-6 seconds and stayed stationary for a few seconds and submerged again. It reappeared again moving further away but the height of the object rose to a great elevation, It begin moving in the direction the bow of my vessel submerging as it was moving.  It was completely under water when it was near my boat. We looked in vain to see what this object was attached to be nothing ever broke the surface of the water. I reported this incident to a friend that works for the coast guard. He said he knew of nothing that would that be capable of supporting such a cylinder and elevating itself above the water and submerging in a few seconds. I’m hoping someone else has reported seeing a similar object here. Any help will be greatly appreciated.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We have written the witness, inquiring whether the object might have been a periscope of a nearby submarine.  We are awaiting a response from the individual, and will add any further comments we receive back from him.  PD))<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((ADDENDUM TO ORIGINAL REPORT))<n> <n><n> <n><n> Mr. Davenport<n> <n><n> <n><n> I just received your last email regarding your request. I’m inclined to say no to any attention this may bring to family and me. I think the size of the object rules out a periscope.  This object was the size of a support pylon you would see under an overpass. It was huge.  My estimation is that object was at least 4 feet wide, circler and appeared smooth and black. I really have no way of knowing the distance of the object except for dead reckoning. Without embellishing the size I still think it broke water and rose to a height of 45-65 feet. The ascent took several second and it remained stationary before it slipped below the water. The lapse of time between submersion and resurfacing was 30-40 seconds and within that time frame it moved 300-500 yards while it was underwater. It did indeed change directions. As the object surfaced and submerged it did cause a wake and disturbance in its area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Its velocity I guess was approx 20-25 knots when it made its final descent as it moved. At no time did we see what the object was attached to if anything at all.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I did not make an official report to the U.S. Navy for obvious reasons. Mainly I didn’t want to suffer any ridicule and I do not want nor am I seeking publicity. I just want a logical explanation as to want we saw. Quite possibly it was something in military in nature.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I do know that it moved in a conscious nature. Something controlled the manner in which it moved. I hope my email sheds some further light and answers some of your questions. Thank you for your time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> P.S I made a typing mistake regarding the time the event took place. It was about 6:00 in the evening and not 2 PM.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Sincerely,  ((name deleted))<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((END ADDENDUM))<n>

The object rapidly swelled to several times its regular size as if going from the size of a grape to the size of a grapefruit) Immediately after it swelled, it dissapeared completely.

I saw this airplane looking object in the distance and it got closer and closer. My sister yelled &#34;look!&#34; i looked and that airplane like object turned into a triangle! It had White sides and a big brite red light in the middle, i looked. and it hovered over us. it was amazing. Then i was walking in to get a camera and i was on my way in going up the drive way. My sister screamed again. I paused, and 2 sides of it disappeared, it only had 1 side and i big red beam in the middle now and my sister screamed again and it started blinking rapidly and fast we couldn&#39;t look at it until it stopped blinking. Then it stopped and took off at great speed of my guess about 500 mph. Then it was too late to get the camera so we went inside to tell my dad. He complained it was an airplane so we ignored the sighting. It was a quiet night and my dad was watching television with us. 30 Minutes later we saw the same blinking and our 5 dogs were barking. My dad always keeps a look-out outside when the dog bark so he looked out and yelled &#34;Oh My God!&#34; and My sister and I came running we looked out and the same type of ship with 3 others of the shape ship were in the sky. We ran out and it repeated again, 2 sides dimmed out and only 1 side and 1 big red beam. My sister yelled &#34;thats the ship dad, thats it!&#34; and then they took off at great speeds. My dad, sister, and I will never forget that moment. I do not know what those ships were, if they were government or beyond this world. I do not know. I don&#39;t believe in aliens at all! However i do believe in ufo&#39;s for sure!<n>

I previously reported seeing objects that appeared to be stars that were low to the ground and when magnified they appear to be some type of energy balls that rotate and pulse and glow like a welding machine. They seem to be motionless to the naked eye but on video can be observed to slowly arc upwards over time. I also have seen strange vehicles which could be normally explained as some type of airplane. Last night I saw one of these orange hovering balls over some nearby houses and when I stopped the car to film it dropped to the ground like a spider on a web. Then when it saw I wasn&#39;t leaving it rose up and started flying slowly away. Anyone else would have said it was just a plane but when I zoomed up on it you can clearly see that it is 3-4 of these little welding balls traveling together not in formation but as one unit seemingly fused together electromagnetically or something. It is beyond all of my comprehension of how this is possible. But in slow motion you can clearly see them individually but moving as one. And kind of pulling at each other as they go. This craft moved away from me just above the horizon until it vanished from view. As I drove away I could see it (light up) again and start circling back to where it had started from. In the 2 inch video window of my camcorder all you could see was a light but on the TV screen at home it is plain to see and as it vanished it seemed as if the spheres broke apart and went in different directions. As I drove along I could see these things almost everywhere. Noone seems to believe me even with the video and laugh it off telling me to watch out or I will get a probing. It is alarming to say the least and it is just like what people had said they had seen but had no proof. I have the proof that the &#34;Truth is Out There&#34; as they say on the X-Files. I have started calling myself Spooky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  One of many reports from same source.  Possibly not a serious report.  PD))<n>

When we were about 6-7 miles north, of the city, I was looking up in the sky watching for the usual airline traffic from the airport. I used to live in Sioux Falls not too far from the airport and loved watching the planes and am well aware of all types of conventional air craft. The day was clear and sunny with just a few lines of whispy clouds. I was watching one jet fly over, east to west and then another came along also, east to west. A little higher in the sky, I noticed a bright round, white,light like a nickle at arms length and, I am estimating about 60 degrees off the horizon to the south and a little west of the city. It was very bright and appeared to be flashing though, it could have just been the reflection of the sun. At first I thought it was another plane but it didn&#39;t appear to be moving and didn&#39;t have a contrail as the other planes did. I asked my husband if he saw it and he said he did. It appeared to be moving in and out and above and below the clouds and would fade out from time to time. When the second plane came over, I noticed another light of the same type lower than the second plane and on the same course. It disappeared after about 5-10 seconds, the other one was still visible. I pulled to the side of the road to get a better look and try to get some pictures. It disappeared as we drove on, then, it reappeared and I pulled off onto the off ramp and drove down another highway looking for a gravel road so I could park and watch it. It was still in the same place in the sky and still doing the same things. By the time I had found a gravel road, it appeared to be higher up but still in the same place and barely visible, then it was just gone. I did notice another plane come from the airport, circle around at a lower altitude in the direction of the light but, don&#39;t think this pertained to it.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I looked again in my rearview mirror and it was right on my bumper. I looked at the clock on the radio and it was fine and the radio was still playing.  I looked in the rearview mirror again and the lights were swaying back and forth still in a line.  The movement was super smooth, like a pendilum on a clock.

However, having seen them last night, I recognized them. With my binoculars only, I can make out the rapid movement of the objects (without actually going anywhere, they just move rapidly back and forth and side to side, a bee-like movement). I can also see the quick changes of colour. I can make out red, white, green, blue and yellow. Once again, these things are not of this world. I have never reported nor seen any kind of supernatural sighting before in my life. But this I am sure of, it is definitely something.

It was dark but the eastern horizon was starting to light up. As I was opening the gate I noticed a very bright light aprox. 10 degrees on the southern horizon. I recall thinking to myself that &#34;Venus sure was bright this morning&#34;. As I drove south through the pasture (aprox 1/4 mile) to the spot I park my truck the light got even brighter and appeared to change colors so rapidly that I couldn&#39;t distinguish what color it was. I stopped the truck just before I reached my destination because even though the light didn’t appear to be moving there was a 200 ft high ridgeline 1/4 of a mile to the south of me and the light was getting very low on that horizon. I grabbed my 12x50 binoculars off the seat of the truck and opened up the door and braced myself between the open door and the cab to steady my position while I viewed the light. There was one small tree on that open h! illside and the light was slightly above and to the left of the tree. It was stationary and didn&#39;t move in relationship from the tree. It did however during the next ten or 15 minutes get very bright then dim. Several times it totally disappeared only to reappear in the same location a few minutes latter.  Every time the light dimmed it would blink very rapidly. Through the glasses the light appeared to get larger and sort of pixilated as it got brighter. It also appeared to change colors but it did it so fast that I could not distinguish which color. I watched this for quite some time and was so fascinated by the event that I didn&#39;t remember that I had a video recorder in my hunting back pack. By this time the sky had brightened considerably and the light had disappeared. I got the camera out and was getting it ready when suddenly the light reappeared. I got a few seconds of video and managed to catch it getting brighter than dimming and the rapid blinking. I also zoomed i! n on the light for a few frames. It dimmed once again blinked ! and disa ppeared for good. It was bright enough by this time to see an object in the sky but nothing was there. I waited several minutes but saw nothing more of it so I decided to go hunting as planned. When I returned home and reviewed the video in slow motion I was quite surprised. It appears to me that instead of disappearing the light leaves upward at a 45 degree angle at a fast rate of speed. I&#39;ve never seen anything like this and though I don&#39;t know what it was I do know that it wasn&#39;t a star, satellite, airplane, helicopter or balloon. I might add that I wasn’t planning to report this to anyone until several close friends who saw the video encouraged me to do so.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Report received by MISSOUR INVESTIGATORS GROUP.  http://ufomig.bravehost.com<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We express our sincere gratitude to the MISSOURI INVESTIGATORS GROUP, and to its Director, BARBARA BECKER, for their having shared this report with our Center.

Aurora extraordinary in colour.  &#34;PULSATING BALLS OF LIGHT&#34;<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have seen strange things on the highways at night driving.  My dog had reacted to some of the stops that I have made in a very peculiar manner.  He growls.  He never growls.  There was not a single thing that I could see, but that doesn&#39;t mean that he couldn&#39;t see something.  Lately the Aurora up here in Winnipeg Manitoba Canada have been spectacular.  I have seen the start of the Meteor showers expected this time of year and I also saw the moon lined up with two planets last Tuesday.  The Aurora that I saw was unexplainable.  I have lived in Northern Manitoba where the Aurora is the usually the most vibrant.  I had never seen anything like I did on Hwy. 6 and 68 on the night of Tuesday November 9,2004.  I saw multiple shades of colours which is usual.  But I also saw &#34;balls of Aurora &#34;PULSATING&#34;.  Now I&#39;m not an astrologist but for some reason that seems strange to me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They were very unreal in the colour and the way that they moved it seemed as if they were moving in a wave motion with &#34;pulsating balls&#34;.  The colours were of the usual green but very bright and then there was a very light yellow but also bright in colour.  As it moved away from the &#34;pulsating&#34; ones it was a very vibrant purple almost violet in color and then white along the edge of that and then the &#34;pulsating balls&#34;  The moon looked as if it was &#34;blurred&#34; (double visioned)but only partially. The two planets were almost perfectly in line.  The middle one was just a little off.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I accidentaly gave my wrong phone number in the UFO report.  The one submitted here is correct.  Could you please contact me regarding this as well as the one I sent about the UFO.  I am very interested in finding out what this is all about.  I am a little curious.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I would like to add something to the e-mail about the UFO.  The car lights dimmed and everytime I tried to get an actual connection with the cell phone, the object dissapeared.  When the connection was broken (sometimes for unknown reason) the object would return sometimes closer than before.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Avon is located South of Rochester NY and East of Buffalo NY.  We had just entered Route 20 where it separates from Route 5. We were heading west.  This is a 2 lane road through a large open field, and a route I regularly travel.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My friend wanted to show me how his new high powered green laser pen worked when pointing it at the moon.  The moon was at about 11:00 and fairly low in the sky.  My friend put the laser up to the windshield so we wouldn&#39;t get back splash from the laser into our eyes.  He pointed it at the moon.  A second or two after pointing it in that direction suddenly the laser hit an object flying by the moon but relatively close to us, maybe a couple of miles away at most. When it hit the object the light from the laser began sparkling and spashing in all directions as if it had hit a prism or similar object of glass.  I thought he had hit the side of a plane and told him to shut it off as we would get into trouble.  After he turned it off, there was nothing in the sky except the moon.  We looked for a plane but nothing was there.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was enough background light from Rochester and Buffalo to allow us to see an object as large as the one we had seen.  Note I was still driving, perhaps 30-40 mph.  We thought this was an abbarition and he again lit the laser.  This time nothing happened when he shown it at the moon.  By chance he moved it around and at the same elevation, but now about 1 oclock he again hit the object.  He followed it for a moment, then shut it off.  We realized that there was something there that did not reflect light as any airplane we knew of might.  Also it was not visible to the eye except with the aid of the laser.   We became a little shaken and I hit the gas and got out of there quickly.  It was cold that evening and so we did not open our windows to listen for sounds. Because the object was only visable with the laser, we could not determine its size, and because the field is mostly open we had no reference point to be sure of the size or the distance from us.  Still knowing the ability of the laser to light a large area a couple of miles away, we knew it had to be relatively close.<n>

My granddaughter got out of the car and started shouting for us to hurry and get out.  There was a long object with white lights on it in the western sky.  As we watched the object changed into two white lights and one red one and looked like a plane.  As it headed toward us, the glow of the lights made it easy to see that it was disc shaped.  At the same time there were lights in the northeast that looked like stars that were playing with each other.  Then  after the disc passed there was an object with three lights in formation that also passed directly overhead going in the southeast direction. There was no sound and it floated.  I have never seen so many different things at one time.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I observed what at first I thought was a very bright star. After it caught the attention of my girlfriend also, we had a closer look. It was definitely not a star. This thing was changing colours, every colour of the rainbow actually. At first it looked like just red and white but when I got it on video, it is definitely much more. Looking with the naked eye, it seems to be one object, looks somewhat like a bright star blinking rapidly. When I looked in my binoculars, it looked like 2 objects very close to each other. Moving very rapidly and wildly. It looked more like some kind of weird electrical force than a UFO, but definitely nothing I nor the people with me had ever seen before. I got out my video camera and zoomed in on it. On video, it shows as one ball of light, changing colour and moving rapidly in every direction, like the movements of a bee or some kind of insect. The binoculars may have been splitting it into 2 or maybe they got a closer look at it and it is actually 2 objects. Whatever it was, it was not from this world. I got about and hour of it on video. It lasted for well over 2 hours, I ended up waking 2 other people that were here and they say it too. When we went to bed at 5:00, it was still there. It is now the following evening and I don´t see it. I just looked at some of the case files on www.ufocenter.com and found one with almost the exact description back in May, also here in Vallarta and also over the Bay. It said that some of the locals know about it and apparently it has been there off and on for years with no explanation. Shouldn´t someone look into this? It is defintely a very odd phenomenon.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I happened to look out the window to the north and observed three white starlike lights in a equal sided triagular form moving in unison slowly across the sky. They looked like the background stars and I would not have noticed them had they not been moving. The lights must have traveled across a large expance of sky before I saw them. In a few seconds, the top light and the bottom right light just went out and the third one on the left fizzled out. Like it went behind clouds. I got the impression that it was way out there but plenty large enough to make out the shape. I think it was located above Sierra County, Ca to our north.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I noticed one around the little dipper that was twinkling very brightly.  Then I realized it had different colored lights blinking so it couldn&#39;t be a star.  It was stationary though.....I looked around and spotted more.  I went into the house to ask my husband what he thought.  He agreed that the one by the little dipper was unusual. He said it definitly had different colored lights on it and it was not a star.  At one point I saw up to five but then some clouds rolled in and only 3 were visible.  They stayed in the same spot for over 1 hour - then I went to bed.  They had red, green and blue lights blinking on them.  They UFO&#39;s were too far apart to be in any formation.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We do have an an airport pattern that runs over our house but these were not airplanes.  They were very high up in the sky but stayed in one spot. They were not stars as the lights were different colors and blinked at different times and the lights were in a horizontal line.  I did not see an outline of the craft so I do not know it&#39;s shape. Both my husband and I tried to locate the objects with binoculars to try to get a better look but couldn&#39;t.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I decided to do a little sky gazing while out there.  I located the galaxy andromeda in the northeastern sky quite a bit east/south east of this galaxy I saw three redish glowing lights.  They were one on top of another, spaced incredibly equally apart.  I remember thinking how odd it was how exactly perfectly spaced they were.  I did see five aircrafts, not circling them, but flying in between them.  The sky was perfectly clear that evening, about after an hour of them not moving. I went inside.  I periodically went back outside every twenty minutes or so, until 23:00.  The only odd thing that happened was the last couple of times I went outside the lights were now white instead of red. They were there for a full two hours, that I had seen, then the last time I went outside they were gone.  However the two hours that I did see them, they did not move what so ever.  And they were not stars.  I am a very frequent sky gazer, I know what I saw was a very odd occurence.  I honestly don&#39;t know if this has anything to do with it. But the following morning both mine, and my husband&#39;s car did not start.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

She clearly spotted 4 windows on the object. The object was very brightly lit. The object was not making any sound. My son got out of the car and saw it too. She thought the color of the object was silver gray. My wife just rushed inside the house with my son and did not look back at the object as she was begining to get very aprehensive.<n> <n><n> <n><n> She also said that she had seen a bright white light en route home from the sitters but did not think much of it at that time.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Slightly above the far side of the valley, I looked out my window, and say two very bright lights, one slightly, though directly above above the other. After watching, a third one appeared above and slightly to the left of the other two. Then the lowest one started to move to the left, and unfortunately it dissapeared behind some trees. I (being in the top floor of a dorm) tried to run to get a better view, but the other two &#34;twinkled&#34; out. At that time, it reminded me of a video I have seen that was taken from above a town it New Mexico or Colorado (I don&#39;t remember, but it was the one that many people caught on tape, and the military said that they were very bright burning flares). I then saw where the three lights were, there appeared three red lights. As I saw these, they slowly went together and after being one red light for a short time (1-2 sec) it dissapeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

When we first sighted it, only a couple of us were convinced it was a UFO.

Last night as I was coming home right after dark I saw what I thought was an airplane. I refer to them as mosquitoes because they have at least six or eight white lights that extend from them. I was about a mile from my house on a big hill where you can see for miles. I saw the first and then a few hundred yards behind was another and then another. This was to my left and then to my right was the same thing. And as I watched in dismay they all went straight towards the direction of my house. And trying to be scientific about all of this I thought OK what a coincidence. Then I watched several of them dropping toward the ground until they went behind the trees. Then two of them that were still in the air turned off their (running lights) and became these yellowish/orange balls that I have been seeing. And yes I was freaking out and no I was not drinking. And the worst part was I had to go home right by there. My house is surrounded by thousands of acres of tall thick wilderness so anything could be out there. I started watching as I turned on my road and sure enough about halfway down I could see through a small clearing some sort of blinking white lights which were on or near the ground. When I stopped to look they turned off as if I was seen. And not no but hell no I did not go to see what it was. Later that night I could see a glow back there like from a town but there is no town in that direction. I could hear what sounded like machinery which reminded me of an oil well pumping station. But to my best knowledge there is not a well back in that creek bottom either. So I went inside and pulled the covers over my head and hid. I have been seeing and filming things nearly every night for about a month and have no explainations. My friend at work said maybe they are some type of military helicoptors or something which would be fine as compared with the alterenative. I only know that I hope it is one of ours and not one of theirs. But I suppose they mean us no harm because I have definitely been seen watching them......I have video but am unclear where to send it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  One of many reports from same source.

I quickly ran outside to my terrace and called to my children a 15 year old and a 5 year old. The three objects were gliding towards the east and went up higher and higher . I ran and got a digital camera but for some reason could not see the objects through the lense. Finally I got a photo . The objects were a brownish color with protrusions but as they got higher they formed an L shape formation and became round in shape. But when we zoomed into the photo two objects were perfect triangles and one was egg shaped. I am a 41 year old mother of three.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Both agree that it flew in a swift horizontal line across the sky.  One person described it as a flying constellation int he form of a triangle...the other said he saw no lights resembling a constellatiion but more like a dark mass shaped like a cigar.  Both saw this shape in the same direction at the same time.  It flew slow enough to see it yet fast enough to determine that it was something out of the ordinary.  Once it went behind a tree it was too difficult to find it in the sky agin because of it&#39;s ability to blend in with the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Behind the two jets a ways back I saw a white/silver orb following behind the jets. It was about the size of a dime at arms length. It followed along behind the jets for about 3-4 minutes, long enough for my school friends to see it too. Shortly after the sphere was lost to view a green helicopter, the same shape as the Maryland Police helicopter but NOT a police helicopter, followed along the same path but much lower and much slower. It may have been a coincidence.    This was reported to me by my 12 year old son. I have transcribed it as told.<n>

As I lingered to watch its tail die out a very, very, very large flying what would one call it, a craft I quess passed effortlesly with not a sound directly over head. It appeared to be a sting of triangelish lights conected together at a perfect diagonal. connected to the lights were long tubes at different lenghts almost reminisent of a revolver chamber on a pistol. I would surmise the object to be about the width of 30 jet size airplanes and an undetermined length. It was hard to comprehend anything that size flying. It did not huver, it did not speed off it simply floated effortlessly towards the east and dissapeared. I have never seen anything remotley like this and can not imagine anyone creating something that looked like this. I will never forget it as long as I live, and feel very fortunate to have seen it. I only hope others did as well.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I noticed it was abnormally still-normally alot of activity(QT and all night car wash and I am by two Hwy 152 and Hwy 169.  It was strange and I was thinking about that then continued to look around- and started to look up overhead, towards the left-I &#39;sensed aspatial disurbance and was observing it when it &#39;uncloaked&#39; and became visible.  It was very low in relation to me and I am in parking lot by interstate, the building is 3 stories tall.  It seemed so incredible I couldn&#39;t believe it and re confirmed but it disappeared(blink of an eye) then reappeared, re-cloaked, uncloaked then cloaked where I could approximate the trajectory but could not physically see it.  It was so quiet I couldn&#39;t believe what I had seen.  I have seen stealth3,4 times.  I have seen a few photos of &#39;triangles&#39; and one video with some sound-this was neither.  It appeared very dark blackish or some deep reddish tone to it, when I could id a triangle shape and movement it seemed like it was not in a power up mode-it had a faint slightly luminous perimeter and throughout the triangle body there was a non random pattern. but equilateral spacing like dots on a triangle-seemed odd but it was faint and it moved with no resistance that was apparent, NO engine sound at all!  I felt surreal, like it was like a  symbiotic type ship-organism and I was being &#39;introduced&#39;-without a face to face meeting-preparing me to accept this.  I think I might see them again and I do not know if they are harmless or harmful.  I felt mentally racy but like the physical was in slow mo, excited/unsure, scared with the unfamiliarity but not threatened to run off-but I was not trying to signal this ship either.  felt like a dream state, somewhat disorienting but handled calmly.  Like a time displacement effect-if they can exist. I have worked with MRI and resonance and know there are subtle shifts a body would feel and this ship had an effect just not sure what.    When I could visually make out the ship then in a moment the faint light/luminousity would manifest.  Then it would drop in intensity a little then more and so on.  Still in awe<n>

Montreal Expos hosted the annual all star league game.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At midnight Nov 7th ( sunday night, our telephone rang , my 17 year old son answered. It was his sister on the phone telling him to &#34;wake Mom, there is a magnificent aurora outside&#34; He folloed her request and imediately came to get me out of bed to come out to look with him. I love all celestial phenomena and since I had alredy been woken by the telephone, I got up to look with him. Before I even opened the back door, I was obvious that there was something spectacular overhead, as I could see incredible distinct rays touching down on the horizon behind our home. I opened the door and we both observed that the rays were now all around us , 360* ! &#34;Wow ! He exclaimed...What is Northern Lights anyway ?&#34; I told him that there are many theories, that it didn&#39;t matter because this was not northern lights. And as the verse resounded in my brain, the words spilled out of my mouth...&#34;And the glory of the lord shone &#39;round about them, and they were sore afraid&#34; &#34;What..What... What the hell are you talking about ?&#34; &#34;Mom you are freaking me out&#34; I recound the sighting that his father and I shared on that night in 1982 ... It&#39;s exactly the same ! What we saw last night was a central swirling light emiting source. Rays of light radiating from its periferal. It had several central lights like that from an airplane or boat would have in indicating port or starbord sides . There were six or seven such lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In our initial sighting , these such lights seemed to be hovering and moving in and out from this central port of swirling mist/cloud.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Last night , I was really spooked, as I was sure I knew this was the same thing, which we had observed so many years ago. We are sure this was a sort of mother ship, with several anex/scout type craft that seemed to be doing reconaisance flights. The Indcredible lights , rays and swirling effects , we concluded , are perhaps a kind of cloaking...radar block ...I don&#39;t know.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My daughters account, will no doubt be more spectacular, as she was out in the woods of Ile Bizard , calling and communicating by cell phone with other friends in other regions whom she also allerted of the phenom.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My husband wakes every morning at 4:45 am, I got up with him, and the light rays were still prominent in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This morning, I have spoken to a few people who have heard of, or that they observed nothern lights last night. Their sighting was much earlier , aprox 8:00 pm and in the area of the laurentian mountains, St.Sauver area. Their party did dispute the idea that what they witnessed was not typical of any norther lights they had ever seen in their region before.<n>

However, as my eyes focused on the object, I quickly realized that it was not consistent with a bird.  It moved &#34;smoothly&#34; across the sky, and no type of movement that would be consistent with flapping of wings was visible.  Moreover, even though the object was not well lighted, its shape seemed to be peculiar.  It appeared to be either triangular, or &#34;boxy,&#34; in shape, although that is a subjective analysis.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I do not know what the object was, but I do not believe it was either a bird, or any type of aircraft.

I was walking my friend to his car which was parked at our garage located in the back of our home. Crossing the back yard I had happend to look to the southern part of the sky. That night the &#34;Northern Lights&#34; were visible in the sky. As I looked to the South part of the sky, I noticed 2 bright red lights flickering in the distance. They seemed to be only a few blocks away, could have been miles, but they seemed close. I pointed it out to my friend, and we watched it for a while. He said it was a plane, but I said it&#39;s moving way to slow, maybe it&#39;s a helicopter. But there were no other lights on it. Just two red lights that would blink or flash one after the other. My friend told me to stop talking about it, because he had to drive 40 miles alone back to his home. I don&#39;t know what it was, but it was awesome.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

They all vouched for this, and swore it on their parent&#39;s graves that they saw something. Both three parties said they saw a (hard to explain) shape (disk) in the sky that was not entirely visible with three rotating rings attached to it. All rings had white dots (lights) attached top it as it stayed in the air hovering for about one minute. My father stopped the car along the road, and both passengers (mom and brother) stepped out. They watched it for a while after it disappeared into the clouds and out of visibility. Knowing my parents, I thought they were pulling my leg, but as they swore it on their parent&#39;s graves I am 100% certain that they saw -something-. If you can explain this to me PLEASE DO, I do not believe in UFO&#39;s as in alien vehicles, but I cant think of any reasonable explanation for this. I asked m,y dad if it looked like it were a laser-show, and he denied it for there were no visible beams and it looked solid. My brother estimated the size as about the size of three ferris-wheels in diameter, yet my father can&#39;t estimate for he doesn&#39;t know the altitude. My brother drew me a picture, and it showsa number of dots around the outer radius and in the center it also has one. I don&#39;t exactly know how to explain it, but if you want more information, just mail, call, fax, whatever you like.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Sincerely, ((name deleted))<n>

PD))|11/9/04|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/040/S40531.html|226|ndxe200411| Many unusual lights on one object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At approximatly 2030 hours MST 11/07/04, there was an object in the North Eastern sky that was about the size of a nickel. Though there is no way to estimate distance. Call it the size of a thumb nail with the thumb held at arms length.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The unusual part of the object was that it had many red lights that flash around the perimeter in a half arc (Northern half). There appeared to be about six or eight of them although they were difficult to count as they flashed in a random manner. If this object was at a great distance from where I was standing, that would cover a very large arc. The object appeared to be green, although there could be flashing green lights also. It had green highlights that came and went. They too appeared to be random as to placement. It also showed a great deal of yellow although the red and greens kind of overpower the yellow. Further, the yellow seemed more concentrated at the middle of the object. The colors were not opaque, they were distinct and bright.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My first thought at seeing it was an airplane with navigation lights and the cabin lights on brightly. However, it didn&#39;t move. Not in any direction. I was visiting a friend at his house and called him out to view it also. He saw the same as I and got his binoculars. What we then saw was the same thing, just a little more clearly. The most powerful he had were 7 X 50&#39;s. We watched it for about a half hour when some cloud cover moved between us and the object and we could no longer see it clearly at all. (Although it was still vaguely visible.) One of the main points being, it did not move in all of that time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have since come home and can still see it but not clearly at all. I have to look though tree limbs as well as the cloud cover.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The second part of the evening that is interesting is that we saw what appeared to be the Northern Lights, but.... they went from the western horizon in a complete arc around to the east. I&#39;ve seen the Northern Lights many times from here, but NEVER in a 180 degree arc. An odd part of that is they appeared to start from the horizon and arc up to a single point just slightly south of overhead. I have seen the N/L&#39;s jump and shimmer all over the northern sky, but never arc to a single point overhead here in Montana. Both the eastern lights and western lights as well as those from the north all arc&#39;d to that single point.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Just to mention, that point was no where near where we saw the object. It was in the lights, but in a much more easterly direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I still wonder about airplane, but have never seen one of those with an entire series of lights that flashed in a large arc. Nor one that appeared to be an disk.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Such fun. I have never seen anything like it in either case.<n> <n><n> <n><n> To add, my location is about 8 miles east of the town of Lavina, Montana out in the hills. There is no possible local lighting that could have caused that.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We express our gratitude to the witness for the original report, and for the follow-up, which allows us to close this case.  PD))<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((ADDENDUM FROM WITNESS))<n> <n><n> <n><n> But, was wrong.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thank you for your response, Mr. Davenport.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Tonight the sky is clear and I went just went out and looked again. Sure enough, it is there. So you are correct. (As you knew, I&#39;m sure. lol.)<n> <n><n> <n><n> I do kind of believe the Northern Lights affected what I saw last night (wondering about which being partly why I included that in my report to you) for I had never seen coloring quite like that.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Yet the star is there in the same place and while not as bright tonight (northern lights have not been turned on at this time) it does have the chromatic effect and the coloring is there, merely not as pronounced.  Which must be why I have not noticed it before. I do watch the sky frequently.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Be assured, if I see another &#39;flying star&#39; I will contact you again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Be well.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((END))<n>

I saw it out of my drivers window and across my field of view at the corner of my eye to where I had turned my head completely to the left to look out the window because it was something not normal. I saw a small intensely bight object flying horizontal at a slight parallel angle of travel to my vehicle which it was traveling at a faster rate of speed. It was hard to discern the true distance or size as it was so small seemingly softball size in relation to my depth perception and traveling above the housing/tree line. The object was traveling faster than my speed, creeping across my field of view for two seconds and my eyes and head following it to the front windshield pillar when I quickly turned my head slightly look at my wife in surprise asking her if she sees that and pointing with my right hand while driving with the left and looking at the object, as I did that I see the object accelerate extremely fast at now seemingly a 45 degree angle where previously parallel to my travel. The acceleration was very linear and extremely fast, with acceleration far faster than an unknown aircraft I saw at Andrews Airforce base which was clearly an aircraft, greenish-grey which was made little noise, slowed, turned, hovered, and accelerated to a sonic boom. This on the otherhand when the object accelerated within this brief time second or so, the light just dissapeared as though it turned off or went so far out of view to where it was no longer visible. The light did get smaller as it seemingly accelerated away from my position and was at a slight upward angle but so fast as it got so small I couldn&#39;t see it or the light turned off. The light of the object was intensly bright with greater intensity with a unusual white-ish color at its center to where you could make out a inner sphere with an outer intensity lessening to a faint white yellow-ish/orange color and to its edge of intensity of a greyish color. The light intensity did not light the sky or leave a smoke trail, nor a light trail as it accelerated. There was enough light at dusk to see. There was no outline of a larger aircraft, it did not strobe, it was not a spark or flash, it was very low to the ground, it accelerated in speed and was not a shooting star or a stationary object and there was no noise I could hear coming from it from inside the car. I would note the travel path did not waver and was at a consistent straight line path of travel and it accelerated along its path.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was as large as my finger at arms length and looked like a comet without a tail. It was so weird that I told my daughter that if it hit it would be a dinasour killer. It continued WSW and when we returned to our vehicle it had moved to just above the horizon in 35 or so minutes. I felt that it was at the upper atmosphere since it remained visable for so long. We took numerous pictures with a digital and a throw away camera. Our friends , father and daughter also watched it for several minutes before it went behind trees and horizon. There was no following tail, no noise, nothing else in the sky, clear evening, no wind and it was traveling opposite of where winds normally originate. I&#39;m sorry but this is unexplainable to me . We checked the internet for comets, strange objects or anything else and found nothing so we went to this site and called in a report.

As we returned to our truck the ? moved acrossed the sky in a wsw direction. It took the shape 1/2 hour or so to reach a point within a few degrees of some lage trees on the horizon. No noise, clear day-night, no contrail or streamers-tail. It was so weird I told my daughter it looked like a comet and if it was to hit it would be a dinasour killer. When we returned to the truck we showed it to our friends, father daughter and took 15 or so pictures as it moved just above the horizon. When we first saw it the size was about finger length directly above us. Since it was still visable after 30 oe so minutes I believe it was a comet. We went home and checked the net to try and find out what it was, no luck. we transfered the photos to my computer and after zooming up they show an elongated shape like a cigar cloud or comet without much tail. I will send the pictures when I return from Denver on Friday. I wish we had the camer when the ? was overhead, this was strange.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke to one of the witnesses to this interesting event, and we found him to be seemingly quite credible.

It passed beneath the dispersed contrail of a jet, but appeared to be at some altitude(maybe 20,000 feet?).  Object was 5 or 6 times longer than wide and blunt at each end.  The rate of passage from my perspective was similar to a jet airplane, but the impression was that it was not being propelled so much as gliding.  It was first spotted by my 5-year old grandson, who asked what it was.  I looked up expecting to see an airplane.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I thought at first that those things I&#39;ve seen are just balloons, but one thing I&#39;ve noticed are the red flashing lights on its &#34;ring&#34;.  The things are moving seesaw-like while spinning at the same time.  They glide by twos, 2 on the upperside and 2 underneath like they were on a parade.

A few degrees above the horizon I saw what appeared to be a &#34;falling star&#34;, i.e., a streak of white light moving downward. There was another white light just to the right of that, which I assumed was a star or planet. However, a few minutes later, I saw a series of lights in the same area of the sky that behaved oddly. I had traveled about five miles farther north, and it seemed that the lights I witnessed were now closer to me, i.e. somewhat larger and brighter, and a little higher in the sky. First, there was one light that seemed to be stationary, but appearing slightly larger than Venus on a clear night. What got my attention was that suddenly a second light appeared beside it, separated by a little distance, then a few seconds later a third light appeared, the same size, brightness, and distance apart, so there were three in a very straight alignment, parallel to the horizon. Next, the light on the left end of the formation dimmed and went out; it took about 1/2 second to fade out, it didn&#39;t just blink off. As soon as it had gone out, a fourth light appeared on the right end of the formation, so there were three again. It was exactly the same size, brightness, and distance apart as the others. After a few more seconds, they each faded and dimmed out, one at a time, in sequence from left to right. After that, nothing. I have seen airplanes and helicopters in the night sky before, and this set of lights was like nothing I have ever seen. I would definitely consider this a sighting of &#34;UFO&#39;s.&#34;<n>

One appeared on the left, one on the right. The one on the right dissappeared, the the one on the left. About two minutes later, 3 more lights appeared horizontally in the same area. All were stationary and very bright. As one dissappeared on the right, another appeard on the left. No more than 3 were visable at a time, but 5 lights eventually appeared, all positioned horizontally.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was odd, that afterwards, we saw what could have been 3 jets(blinking lights in the sky, followed by the sound of jets once they moved), hovering around the area. They spent approximately 5 minutes flying around the area of the bright lights, before heading south and out of the area. We saw a similar appearance last night, but the three lights were lined up vertically and we have seen the same thing numerous times repeating the same patterns since January.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I just got out of the car when something in the shy caught my attention. At first I thought it was a spotlight pointed skyward and reflecting off the clouds. But I soon noticed that it appeared to be more than one light. The lights would converge and get slightly brighter. Then they would shoot outward spinning in a counter clockwise motion then coming together again before repeating. It looked to me that there were four of these lights. The lights were soft, diffuse, white in color and would become elongated the further they moved away from their convergence point. My wife saw this also, she called the local police to see if anything was going on in the area but they said no. We live in the country just outside a small town. I did not see any beam of light coming from the ground like you would normally see with a bright light and I would assume you would need a powerful light to illuminate the clouds as these clouds were very high. The only variance I saw with the lights was that sometimes the lights appeared to shoot farther out after coming together. My wife said she thought the lights changed shape slightly but I could not tell. This lasted for about 20 minutes. To be honest I have no clue what these lights were, I wondered if they may have been coming from above the clouds. Anyway, although there is probably a natural explanation for what we saw, we thought it was strange and having never seen anything like this before we wanted to report it.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I was driving north on PCH, coming home from work.  I sawe a white bright light, bright like reflcted snow, come down at almost a complete perpendicular drop. It appeared 100-200 meters above the beach level. It was the whitest light I have ever seen.  It appeared small, diamond shaped, with a small tail.  What could have been around 1-2 football fields in length from the ground, was a sudden disapearance of the object.  It was moving at a speed that no man made object could move (I believe), being so close to the water.  I had my windows up and music lightly playing, but I heard no crash of a landing or saw no impact into the ocean or beach.  I advise someone ASAP to search the water off-shore for anything unusual.  As soon as the object disapeared, the &#34;check engine&#34; light on my car came on, but my engine did not fail to stop.  After careful thought, I ruled out the posibilities of what it could be : not an astroid/meteor, no fireworks, not a plane or a helicoptor.  I was about 30-40 miles away from camp Pendleton, but I have never heard of anything from that army base ever - EVER - leave north and become visible to any civilians.  What I saw was no hallucination, I was not under the influence of any illegal substance, was not tired, and was sober and sane.  I just hope that this report does not go unnoticed for any more than a day or so after I give it, because most likely any government official/organization will do what they can to erase the evidense within hours or days.  This can be something big.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

They caught my attention as I have a large security light and these were some what brighter. At first I thought they may be aircaft landing lights as Airborne express is 25 miles north of my home. Frequent fly overs late at night are the norm. I also have worked there and these lights were spaced to far apart to be a aircraft. ALso as close as they appeared I saw no wing lights and no noise was heard as should have happened with the estimation of the distance from me.  NO operations go on at Airborne this time of the week. I thought maybe it could be a training flight from there and got out of my car to await the flyover. Suddenly they just disappeared. THis is in a rural area and I heard a number of dogs barking off in the distance.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

My friend pointed out that there were lights in the sky.  He pointed to the North Western sky, and there were 2 very bright (in relation to the airplane I saw in the sky, and the stars) stationary orange lights.  The two lights faded out, and one light appeared in the sky.  This light faded out within about 5 seconds, and about 2 seconds later another identical stationary orange light appeared to the North of the previous light.  This pattern continued 3 or 4 more times with the light fading and another reappearing in the sky to the north of it (about 2 inches apart on the windshield of the car we were in, to give an approximation of distance).  After the lights disappeared another light was spotted about a minute later in the Northern sky (much further from the previous sighting).  This light lasted about 3 seconds, and disappeared after a tree got in our line of sight of it (we were driving, and I assume that it faded out as the rest of them).  We all spotted 6 or 7 bright orange stationary lights in total.  Wether or not they were the same object or not I am unsure of (keep in mind there were two lights at first, and they both disappeared at the same time), but if it were the same object it would have to have been moving EXTREMELY fast to travel as far as it did in the sky (between lighting intervals).  There was a plane overhead in the sky at the time of the sighting which looked much much dimmer and smaller than the orange lights and which moved along at a relatively slow rate (in comparison to the distance of the lights between lighting intervals)<n>

I remarked to my wife that this was a very bright &#34;star or planet&#34; which was in the sky almost directly overhead.  As I watched it, it began to move at a tremendous speed to the southeast, climbing almost straight up.  It rapidly grew smaller and eventually faided to a pinpoint of light and dissappeared.  All the while I was watching this object, I was trying to get those standing around me to be able to see it.  It was moving so rapidly, I do not know if anyone else in the group ever caught sight of the object before it became too high and too dim to see anymore.  It was the color of white light,as I said earlier, about the size of a close large planet which might be viewed in the sky at night.  It was much brighter than any of the other star patterns in the sky.  It left no vapor trail of any sort.  The night sky was clear with no clouds.  The moon was not visible in the direction the object sped off.  It did not traverse the horizon, but instead appeared to be travelling upwards.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was bobbing up and down and wobbling back and forth and side to side all the while moving linearly from my right to left. It covered about 5 - 10 degrees of arc in that easterly vector.  The surface of the craft was like  polished black granite. The shape was circular about 30% high as wide and the sides seemed to be made of flat triangular sections that reflected the sun in a clear blue sky as it bobbed and wobbled. After watching for about 20 seconds I left to get my binoculars for about 20 seconds and when I got back it was not visible. There was no audible sound from inside the house during the siting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Temperature outside was about 60 F.  No wind. Slight haze on the horizon. No other visual observers present. Described the experience to my father as it was happening.  Have always felt that I would one day see a UFO out this window as I sat there. Was happy and excited to unexpectedly see it. Disappointed that it disappeared before seeing it through the binoculars.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I had received a call on my cell phone, and was driving about 5 minutes past the last exit for Lakeland when my husband grabbed my arm and pointed at something in the sky.  The object was round with a short trail.  It was gold in color and bright, both the trail and the round object.  It seemed very far away.  We thought it was a comet or shooting star at first, but then the trail instantly turned off...is the best way to describe it...the round object kept moving for a few seconds, then also instantly disappeared.

Now there were 2lights about 30 degrees off the horizon. I told my wife who was in the car with me to look at what I was seeing. We were meeting a car so she admonished me for not watching the road. I turned to face the oncoming car to make sure I was in control of the car. I again turned my head to look at the lights. This time I saw 4 lights in a row parallel to the horizon. Again I checked for traffic saftey by looking ahead. I again turned to face the lights. This time there were 2. While I was watching them they individually vanished one at time, just like as if someone turned of a light switch. The lights were perfect spheres sharply outlined with the light coming through a surface much like a frosted light bulb. The color was a pale orange glow. Their size was similar to a round automobile headlight when viewed from 20-30 feet away. My wife felt they were considerably bigger. We turned down the first road to the west to investigate the general area and drove 2 miles. There was no sound associated with this experience and no further sighting took place. I am a pilot and I have never experienced anything like this before or since. The weather was perfectly clear. They were not landing lights or navigation lights on an aircraft. Their glow did not change except to vanish instantly.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Grand Prairie is a suburb of Dallas.  There are always planes flying around and I enjoy watching their lights at night.  This night was different than any other I had evr witneesed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I looked toward the east-northeast over Dallas and saw a star configuration of three stars perfect aligned, one above the other.  I noticed on either side of the middle star and equidistant on each side of that star, two objects which I could not discern as they were so far up.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The objects appeared to pulsate with a red,blue,and white or silver lights which were lined up vertically and in that order.  I thought it was odd that they did not move as planes do as I see so many from my neighborhood.  As I stood and watched these objects, I noticed they started moving in what appeared to be a lateral fashion in quick motions.  They moved in step with one another.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After watching these lights for several minutes, I went a got my wife, my 14 year old son, and my cousin who was visiting us to come see if they could tell me what they saw.  They were all astounded by these lights as well.  They witnessed what I did.  No one had any explanation.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The three stars aligned vertically were probably part of a constellation but none of us had ever seen pulsating or alternating lights in a constellation before.  That what led us to belive that we were witnessing something unusual.  At least to us it was.  The objects appeared much larger than the vertical stars.  It was just impossible to tell how far up in the sky they were.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I hope I have described this to some degree of specificity.  Never in my life have I seen such so this is my attempt at a description of unknown objects. We watched them for approximately an hour and then went back in the house.  I tried taking a digital photograph of them but the pictures did not come out as the objects were too far away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Based on the description, we suspect that celestial bodies would have to be ruled out, before we could conclude that the objects were, in fact, genuine UFO&#39;s.  However, that is just a guess on our part.  PD))<n>

As I was taking the exit, there is a car dealership located right at the curve.  I was talking to my daughter on the cell phone and noticed a gold object, shaped like a saucer which had a lighted dome and muted colored lights at the bottom.  It was huge and situated behind the bright lights of the car lot.  At first I thought it was a gimmick to attract customers to the dealership.  Then it moved very slowly, coasting back and forth from left to right.  I screamed as I realized it was the real thing...a UFO.  I parked my car and had a better view.  I described it to my daughter and said I wish I had a camera so I can show her how it looks.  I&#39;ve had a camera phone but never used it, so I completely forgot I had a camera until my daughter mentioned it.  I drove out of the parking lot and told my daughter I was going to take a snapshot of it.  As I moved closer to the object, in a matter of 3-4 seconds, it faded and disappeared in the night sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report describes self as holding a responsible job.

So, given the positions of lights on this plane, and the fact that it was completely silouetted against the sky, i could see that this thing is an equilateral triangle.  It could still be a plane.  Just one of those completely triangular ones.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The thing passed again 10 or 15 minutes later, heading in the opposite direction, not flying as low (but still low).

I proceeded to drive to a local cafe which had a drive through window and continued to notice the two lights that were fixed in the northern sky. The food order that I had placed took a considerable amount of time (about thirty min.), and I became to be interested when I noticed that these lights could not have been from aircraft as they had stood completely still for slightly more then a half hour. After I collected by food I intentionally drove to a dark secluded parking lot in Harrison Township which is just outside of my mount clemens where I had initially observed the lights, and I parked and gave careful consideration to their continued existance.  Upon closer observation and comparision to various stars that appeared in the same area as these lights I could see that ALL of the stars that were in the sky were so lacking in their brightness in comparision to the lights that I had now been observing for an hour that there was no way that they were anything except that of being man made in their nature.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After about two hours of careful observation the lights still remained in exactly the same location as when I first observed them, fixed very high into the northern sky. After the two hours of my time had passed, I tired and retreated for the night, last viewing the lights at around six a.m. eastern standard time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Bio of the observer:  The observer who relayed the above account is ((personal information deleted.

The sky was cloudy due to a cyclone in the Arabian sea.

Astronomy enthusiast and stargazer since 10years. And extremely interested in any kinds of flying machines , visit my room and find posters of all kinds of warplanes. (thats why I can easily concude that the UFO I saw was not a normal one built on existing earthly technology. Why would the USA be spending billions on the F-22 if it would have owned the UFO I saw, which was so noiseless and RADAR invisible. Moreover,  newspaper reports of unidentified RADAR signatures in the Air traffic control was NOT reported, that means the the UFO was: 1)Invisible to RADAR 2) Noiseless  Note, I on another site on the net, have come to know of a similar sighting of a similar type of UFO in Jaipur, Rajasthan , India, at october 2004. (note that I live in Bangalore, Karnataka, India)  (Note: the weird noiseless flight, and the prescence of rather big circular yellowish light emitting things underneath. . makes me almost sure that the UFO I saw was similar to the one in phoenix Arizona in 1996/97 , later when I searched on google for pictures of UFOs on the internet, if I could find someone who had in the past photographed the kind of UFO I had seen, I was surprised that the photos of Phoenix, AZ were somewhat similar to the one I had seen.)<n>

I&#39;m now attending college for culinary arts. I have lived in a high rise penthouse apartment for almost 27 months now. What I saw this morning was different then anything I have ever seen in my lifetime. I&#39;ve seen shooting stars from my apartment balcony which faces southwest. I look out my huge window daily and nightly to catch glimpses of the beautiful philly skyline that i have from my apt. I can see the airplanes turn and descend then land at the airport from my apt. Especially on clear nights I can see them coming and going extremely well as they pass back behind the skyline.Another thing is I&#39;m constantly checking outside for good shots to take of the changes in the season with the leaves and the city with my digital camera. This morning at around five am I got out of bed to get a drink of water, as I was pouring the water I was thinking to myself what a cool night it was and how it was probably really clear out. so I walked over to my balcony window and looked outside as I drank my water. I noticed it was extremely clear out and almost twilight. Although it was still dark out I noticed that it was going to be a clear day to come. I could see the blueness of the sky along with some puffy little clouds about too. As i was looking at the blueness of the sky and thinking to myself how it was pretty amazing how I could see the color in the sky even though it was still dark out. Then I noticed two extremely bright lights that were very close to each other. they were too bright too be planes and on clear nights you can clearly make out the shapes of planes, and also see the flashing lights on most of them. Although it was clear there wasn&#39;t much to see of any stars like in the summer time. these were not moving at all, if so very slow then. Not stars, not planes, not a helicopter, these were way too high up for that. They were extremely bright though, I was thinking to myself that someone else must be viewing them also. They were almost as bright as the moon when it is half full. I watched them for about ten minutes looking about thge rest of the sky at the same time looking for stars or planes to try to determine what it could be, I knew it wasn&#39;t something normal, it was interesting enough for me not to want to go back to bed, so I proceeded to go and quickly charge my dead video camera battery for a few mins. I then returned to record the footage. They were still there too close together to be airplanes, and besides they weren&#39;t moving, but they weren&#39;t stars. i taped them for about ten to fifteen mins. I zoomed in on them with my cam. very bright white light surrrounded with what looked like some type of fire or electronic field of energy. Then they both dissapeared for a moment, or so I thought, that&#39;s when I noticed that they were indeed moving because they had passed behind a cloud briefly just very very slow. I started to wonder if they could be sattelites or something, but why two so close together, and why did they move so slowly, yet seem to never change the distance between them. Then I thought maybe some type of anti-terrorism patrol craft that the military is testing or something. what better time to do it then 5am when normal working people aren&#39;t quite awake yet, and the partiers are sleeping. Not as much chance for someone sighting it. I&#39;ve seen numerous planes in the sky flying about the city around a month ago with what looked like spotlights on them flying around the philadelphia skyline, but they were moving quickly enough to tell that they were defintly moving. They also were much, much closer to the ground. These I don&#39;t know what they were. In read some other ufo reports and there is one on sept. 23rd 2004 in Hartland that sounds very similar to the two objects that I saw. I remeber starting to get tired after watching them for about thirty minutes and turned the camera off and went to bed. I should have stayed up to finish watching them but was too tired. Please respond to me and let me know if anyone else has seen what I saw. thanks ((name and number deleted))<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Venus and Jupiter.  PD))<n>

It was still very much dark outside, but clear.  Much clearer than usual.  There wasn&#39;t the typical pink haze above Richmond.  My attention focused directly toward the Eastern sky where I saw what would be two stars.  Most stars aren&#39;t very bright and even the North star had never glown this brightly. The lights we&#39;re side by side and at a slight angle.  I want to say that they moved slightly, much like hovering in one place for an extend period time.  I pointed them out to my wife, who had just gotten out of the shower and was quite alert.  She agreed that it was not normal and became more or less scared enough to call her sister at 5:25 in the morning.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Venus and Jupiter.  PD))<n>

Then three red/Orange lights in a triangle shape came down from it slightly (about 5x it&#39;s heighth)Then we went to the front yard to get a better look.  The red/Orange lights were no longer there, but the bright light continued to dim and brighten.  It began to blink and then move about the sky in a swinging motion.  Suddenly it just disappeared.  I have no idea what that could have been, but I&#39;ve never seen anything like it.  It was really weird and the whole thing lasted about 1 minute.  I&#39;ve continued to look for it for a while, but haven&#39;t seen anything.  I&#39;ve never been interested in this sort of thing, but now it is hard to ignore.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

If this was one object then it must have been moving at the speed of light because by the time the first light was disapearing, the next one was there.  when the last of the four lights dimmed out i focused on the area that the lights were in, i was able to spot out a solid very faded white light, going in the oposite direction as before and was going behind the trees, me and my gf ran down the driveway to get to the porch, which over looks a large field, sure enough after a couple of minutes i could see the object coming out from behind the trees, the faint white light, began to dim out at this point, we waited and waited i think about five or ten min went by when the bright orange flash came again, it was huge this time, it apeared to be about the size of a dime from my perspective. two very smaller orange lights then shot towards the ground at 45 degree angles from the object, then the large light dimmed again, then about a min later we saw the four lights in the sky to make a quarter circle, from 12 o&#39;clock first then down to 9 o&#39;clock, on another note none of these objects made any noise at all, and when u can even see a plane or helicopter in the area, u always hear it before u can even see it, and that was the end of the exp. that night but i asure you its not nearly the only strange activity that ive seen out on the farm<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of the event is approximate.

I looked up and I saw an object flying northbound. It was a set of circles that formed an open end triangle much like a &#34; &gt; &#34; sign. This object was flying not as high as commercial jet but not as low as private small aircraft. The reason I know this is because shortly after the sighting I saw a commercial jet flying northwest of our location and about one minute later we saw a small private plane traveling east of us. This object was really moving much faster than both of these aircraft. The circular lights that made this formation were not like regular lights, there were no center of brightness the whole circle was evenly lit. There was no sound coming from the object it seemed to just be gliding across the sky. I wondered if it was maybe a balloon but then little before it disappeared the formation of these lit circles changed, they seemed to form an almost circular shape. At the high speed of travel the object changed direction several times, very fluently and smooth- unlike an airplane the angles of change were not like an aircraft at that speed. I told some friend’s but- I don&#39;t tell people anymore. They just don&#39;t believe.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

As i walked and got nearer the object, the tree no longer impaired my vision it then began to catch my eye, the colour was bright orange and glowed like a ball of flame.It had appeared stationary, however it then began to move quickly vertical and horizontal passing overhead, it was difficult to tell how high or close it was, there was not any noise associated with the object,it appeared to travel very smoothly and without effort.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had a very powerful spotlight with me and decided to direct it at the object, to my amazement it instantly vanished.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have always  been sceptical of this type of sighting but will in the future keep a more open mind.I am sure it can easily be explained?<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report elects to remain totally anonymous.

The bright yellow went dimmer, and then we could see some red lights on the outer edge.  It then went brighter, and then the bright yellow disappeared for a second or so.  It then came back and stayed for about 10 seconds. It then made a 90-degree abrupt turn towards the north.<n>

I was looking between some large Queen Palm trees, so those managed to give me a feeling of scale. There were no clouds that I could tell, the stars were out. The sky was a bit hazy. We are near John Wayne International Airport so I am always seeing and hearing planes flying overhead, usually on takeoff, and usually flying from east to west (opposite to this things flight path) I also have a strong understanding of visual recognition of aircraft from many years working at/near air bases - I am in the aerospace industry. Note that we are about 1 mile south of Interstate 405.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At about 6:45 PM, I saw a motion in the sky that attracted my attention. It was moving from the west towards the east, straight in front of me. Since I was looking west, it appeared to move up in the sky. It was moving at a high velocity compared to the aircraft I usually see flying, perhaps twice as fast or more. It flew up to almost directly overhead, then turned abruptly to the southeast. It appeared to be increasing alitude, although that is a bit speculative. It flew between the fronds of the palm tree, and finally up over the roof. By the time I got to a better viewing angle, it was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The vehicle itself looked triangular in shape and was black/gray, looking more like a mottled gray shadow against the black sky. It seemed as if the bottom of the vehicle either had a slight glow or was reflecting lights from the city below, as there seemed to be a bluish mottling over the bottom surface. The leading edge had a number of fairly dim lights, perhaps five to seven. I think there were a couple of lights on the trailing edge, but I&#39;m not certain of that. There was no sound whatsoever, although aircraft engines were heard a few minutes later as a airliner flew over. The size of the vehicle seemed impressive .. I see aircraft through our typical haze all the time, including planes flying around tonight, and this seemed much more diffuse, so I think it was fairly high up, higher than typical commercial aircraft. The overall impression was a large triangular shape flying high above the normal traffic pattern at a high velocity, but that could be way off. I did notice a decrease in traffic around that same time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Bear in mind I do not think this was &#34;alien&#34;, more likely some sort of secret military surveillance vehicle.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness describes himself as an engineer.

Eve/Nov. 4 6:25 PM my freind, ((name deleted)), was driving in a Boeing semi-truck southbound past Brooks, Oregon on I&#39;5 (just 1/2 hour ago) spotted a large white light (round/ball-shaped) in the night sky. (I don&#39;t have all the exact details but he called me on his cell phone in a highly excited state to give me some basic info.) Apparently he could see the object out of one of his windows and said if he&#39;d had his arm stretched out it would be about the size of a quarter. Thus, it appeared MUCH larger than others stars and typical night sky objects.  The object seemed to be keeping pace with his truck as he continued south on I-5 and for a time seemed not to be actually moving at all but it looked so big and odd that he elected to keep his eye on it.  All of a sudden the object shot across the sky at an extremely fast speed then stopped.  He said it came to an unbelievably ABRUPT stop.  It hovered in that spot for a few seconds then shot across the sky again in a different direction and came to another abrupt stop. I&#39;m not clear how many times the object did this but he continued to watch it.  All of a sudden he said the object faded to black and disappeared right where he last viewed it hovering.  He said he never saw it dart away instead it was like it faded to black.  Because ((name deleted)) is on a tight trucking schedule he is not able to make a report himself this evening.  He will be back home in Auburn, Washington on Saturday afternoon, Nov. 6 and will e-mail you then with more precise details.  I&#39;m not sure if I got every little fact straight here but I thought you should know the basics as quickly as possible tonight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We express our gratitude to the source of this report for submitting it.

I saw the usual yellowish orange ball to the east of me when I noticed a blinking light near it. It either came out of it or was circling checking it out. It kind of darted back and forth then slowly headed my way. I filmed it as it passed over a little to the south of me and as it went by I could hear a faint roar like a jet. But the sound kept getting louder behind me instead of in the direction of the objects path as would be expected. I turned around and about 3-400 feet above me was some huge craft several hundred feet across with two large lights in the back of it heading in the direction of the orange ball. At first I thought it was two fighter jets going to look at the ball but soon realised it was one vehicle and it was moving way too slow for a jet. A jet would have fallen out of the sky moving that slow. I jumped around to film it and got about 10 seconds of video before it went behind some trees, that is how low it was. As I watched the video, all but around 3 seconds was jumping and shaking but in slow motion there is definitely something there. But no dicernable shape is visable. But the lights I thought were flames were blinking. They stayed on but blinked intermittently through the white light. It was strange and I showed the video to people at work and they had no answer either. I saw a show on the Phoenix Lights the other night and clear as day was the same type of lights as the object passed overhead. I am open for suggestion and have video footage if you are interested.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report provides no contact information, so we cannot contact the party, and have little evidence for linking this report to any other.

What struck me as odd was that it appeared much closer and brighter than any of the other stars.  The object had a very bright white light and appeared to alternate smaller lights of flashing red and pale blue.  I got out my 35mm gear, mounted a 300mm lens, and heavy duty tripod to aid my viewing.  Using the focusing screen&#39;s center fresnel as a reference point, the object moved very slowly through the field of view; the camera was completely rock steady.  Over the course of the next two hours the object continued to exhibit the same light patterns.

As we came to the intersection I noticed what I thought to be a low flying plane. It was a very bright white light. It went behind the trees on the mountain then came back out and took an arched dive. It landed halfway down the mountain.  The traffic moved and we lost track of it.  The electricity went out at the same time in a three mile range.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

This report involves a single object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I use a Panasonic GS-12 mini-DV camcorder. I had the shutter speed at approximately 1:200, and manually focused.... (I never fish with 1:60 normal shutter speed or auto focus). The cam has 20x optical/200x digital zoom, I had it set to around 60x. It was a mostly clear night and I was filming out my front window toward the East (had glass and screen down). The moon was rising and at about 45degrees. I didn&#39;t observe the object until reviewing the film.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The whole thing takes place in well under 1 second. The object enters the frame at 7:00 position (quickly), then it seems to pause/stop for the slightest fraction of a second before accelerating at incredible speed at slightly less of an angle.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The interesting things to me are the apparent change of direction and acceleration. These factors, (as well as object size to camcorder zoom ratio) decrease the odds of it being something immediate to my position (bug,bird,debris,etc). It&#39;s behavior is inconsistant with a plane or satellite.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I higly reccommend anybody curious to get out their camcorder and give this a try. MANUAL shutter, MANUAL iris, and MANUAL focus help a great deal. Also don&#39;t zoom way in... try to keep it as much in the optical zoom as possible.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I encourage anyone handy with photo or video editing to PLEASE examine this. I am including my highest quality mpeg of this event as well as 1 jpeg of the object when it&#39;s apparantly still. And 1 jpeg just as it starts to accelerate. (e-mailing to ufocntr@nwlink.com).<n> <n><n> <n><n> In the future I plan to record in tandem with a friend across town (parallax is really what&#39;s needed).<n> <n><n> <n><n> Video edited using Pinnacle Studio 8.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report elects to remain totally anonymous.  We have viewed the video footage, and our suspicion is that the object is not inconsistent with the flight of an insect in proximity to the camera.  However, it the camera was focused at infinity, that might militate against our theory.  On the other hand, the object crosses the entire disc of the Moon in approximately 1 second.  If it was in proximity of the Moon, some 2000 miles in diameter, that angular velocity would translate to 14 million miles per hour, which seems unlikely to us, given that the object appears to change its course halfway through its passage across the disc of the Moon.  We would like to correspond with the source of the report, but he/she will have to contact our Center, since we do not have contact information for the party.  PD))<n>

The sky, then, was unusually clear (meaning that any stars were visible at all; I certainly couldn&#39;t see anything in the sky dimmer than major stars, e.g. satellites).  I noticed a hovering red light in the distance -- a helicopter, maybe a plane.  Then, two points of light entered my field of view almost directly overhead, travelling from west to east.  My first thought was military aircraft, because the points, which were yellow, were travelling in tandem with a constant distance between them.  Then the points of light veered away from each other somewhat before coming back together, essentially flying two gentle arcs before returning to their previous arrangement.  I realized, as the lights vanished (not exactly over the horizon, but out of view), that they were travelling far faster than aircraft.  That&#39;s it.  I&#39;m writing this because the lights seemed unusual; I&#39;m certainly not conviced I saw UFOs.  But I&#39;ve seen plenty of shooting stars, airplanes, and satellites, and these weren&#39;t that.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It seemed to be just barely above the house. The sound was that of the typical movie flying saucer sound from a &#39;50s outer space flick.  It was an extremely loud, very high-pitched whoop, whoop, whoop sound...very rapid and very squeal or beep-like. We thing about 80 or 90 decibels. The sound was accompanied by chaotic bright white flashing lights.  The object flew over extremely fast...I jumped out of bed and ran outside - hoping to get a glimpse, but it was already gone...just a residual sound in the distance.  A light fog was beginning to form outside, but I should have been able to see at least the flashing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have never heard anything like this, except in the old flying saucer movies.  We&#39;ve lived here for the past 8 or 9 years, right near Fort Lewis, and within 30 miles of the McCord Air Force base, and see and hear many aircraft, but nothing like this...so loud, so close...and so strange.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We are both in our late 50&#39;s, college grads, and wide awake at the time of this happening. Although I believe there are such things as UFOs, I have never seen any and my husband is a skeptic. We almost couldn&#39;t believe this was happening, because it was just too &#34;Hollywoodish.&#34;<n>

Object moved at a high rate of speed in an irregular zig-zagging North West - South East direction while on the main West - East direcion. The shape was like a boomerang, lighter than the surrounding dark, star filled sky and the leading edge was lighter than the rest of it sort of a misty see-through glow. The object seemed solid from point to point. No blinking flashing colored lights. No windows. No trail behind. Absoloutly silent. It moved much faster than a plane (prop or jet) or helicopter. Altitude was up about where small airplanes fly. About five minutes later, a helicopter with red and blue strobe lights (patrol) flew through the airspace that the object went through.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I called me spouse outside in time for both of us to watch as this VERY LARGE, diamond-shaped craft approached and traveled directly over our house. It moved slowly with almost no sound. A low hum could be heard, although were you inside a house or doing anything outside that made even a slight bit of noise, you would not have heard the hum. The object had a red light in the middle of it&#39;s massive belly that slowly blinked on and off. Looking directly up at it, a blue-green light on the left tip, a white light on the right tip and white light on the top or front tip. The back tip of the diamond was also a red light, though fainter and not blinking. It was an awesome sight, this huge, silent diamond slowly going over our heads. We have not seen it since, though we have seen very bright, red and white lights that hover, then move, then hover some more within one mile from our house. Another witness also saw the red and white lights and feels it was definitely triangular-shaped, possible diamond-shaped, and when he attempted to follow the lights they would move about.<n>

My son is 25.  On Nov 3rd, 2004, at 8:45PM, I went to deliver an ATV to my son&#39;s rural residence.  There was no one home, I waited, he arrived a few minutes later.  When he pulled into the driveway, he drove all the way to the rear, near the barn, where I was, and told me to get in, that we needed to go around the row of trees that bordered the north side of his property so that I could &#34;see the lights&#34;.  He seemed urgent, I got in and when we drove around the trees there were the lights he was talking about.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Seven bright yellow-orange lights arranged in 2 groups.  The left group was almost a straight line of four lights, the right group of three lights was slightly seperated from the other four, and was triangular in shape.  The lights resembled sodium street lights in color, but very intense.  We observed these lights for what seemed like four to five minutes, through binoculars that my son had in the car, as we are waterfowl hunters also.  Through the magninification of the binoculars the lights were very visible, and appeared bright form edge to edge, being circular in shape.  This was odd, as most light sources are brighter in the center than the edge.  After approximately four to five minutes, the lights began to go out from right to left, one by one.  The last remaining light stayed bright for about 30 seconds, then slowly dimmed from view.  The lights never moved, and seemed to be hovering over the farmland.  We waited an additional 3 or 4 minutes to see if they would re-appear, and did not.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The sky was clear and eventhough the Phoenix Sky Harbor Airport is near-by there weren&#39;t any commercial aircraft overhead when I took my photographs.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Approximately an hour later I down loaded the 19 railroad images from the Microtech 16MB &#34;Digital FlashFilm&#34; card onto my HP Vectra VL420 DT computer. While reviewing the photos I had just taken of the locomotive, I noticed that in the upper left corner of the 5th picture in the series were three evenly spaced white/light circular objects with a dark triangular object beneath them. It almost looks like the dark object is pursuing the three light objects.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I didn&#39;t notice the objects when I was taking the pictures and don&#39;t recall hearing any aircraft type sounds. There was a busy street near-by which was producing quite a bit of road noise.

It was flickering and I thought that maybe it was just a plane or a helicopter, but it didnt get any closer or futher away from us the entire 20 minutes we were watching it. There were two small stars around it that we were comparing it to, and they didnt move at all but what we were looking at did. It would be completely still and then move left or right or in a circle, drop down or move up, it was weird.  But it didnt move from the general area that it was in. It flickered the entire time, almost like a plane but you couldnt see any definning caracteristics.Then the clouds moved in and blocked our view. And to make it even stranger, weve looked the last three nights, and it&#39;s not there anymore, so that rules out it being a star. Unless it burned out, but do they move around when they burn out.? I don&#39;t think so. This was a very weird thing that happened and now has me interested in finding out if anyone else saw it. I&#39;ve seen countless shooting stars, eclipses even meteor showers but never anything like this. What we saw was in the direction of the Virginia, Pennsylvania area. Im 25 years old and my friend that saw it with me is 23. We have never saw anything like this in our lives. I mean in the entire universe there has to be something out there, and I think we may have saw it. Im not some wierdo that claims to have been abducted or had some strange encounter. Im a strong minded person and I know that what I saw wasnt a star or a plane or anything of this earth for that matter, if it was it was something Ive never seen or heard of. What we saw has enticed me to go and buy a telescope, and made somewhat of a believer of me. Ive always thought about what might be out there millions of miles away. I just hope that when we find it, we dont regret it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Venus.  PD))<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

After spotting the pulsing light that seemed somewhat orange-white, I observed that it moved up and down, in a zig zag, moved to the right and left, sometimes hovered.  For about 15 minutes my father and i discussed the strange movements over the telephone while the craft zipped around.  The craft was high above the treeline, probably in the area of aircraft flight patterns.  It was also observed the craft became stationary for some time when for some reason, aircraft traffic increased.  At least 7 flights passed in the area of the sighting.  It started to look like a regular junkyard in space.  If this was a military flight, I&#39;m impressed with the technology.  If this was something extra-terrestrial...why didn&#39;t the other aircraft seem to be aware of it?<n>

The higher one was brighter than the one below it. They weren&#39;t flashing(or moving) and they weren&#39;t flickering like stars. They were both brighter than stars normally are- save maybe Jupiter on a dark night when it&#39;s visible. But they were way brighter than anything else in the sky- almost looked like landing lights from two planes coming in but like I said they weren&#39;t moving. I sat there and watched them for a while- probably a half hour or so. They never moved- and they were still bright after the sun had started to come up and the rest of the sky got lighter.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was large in comparison to the jets I can see taking off from the airport.  It looked like a teardrop sideways and was very orange/red with a tail behind it.  The color is what caught my eye looking out of the window.  Watched it until I couldn&#39;t see it anymore because of a building obstructing my view<n>
11/1/04 21:00|Morgantown|WV|Unknown|approx. 5 sec.|beam enters my room|11/9/04|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/040/S40425.html|317|ndxe200411| beam enters my room<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was approximately 9PM, and I was in my bed watching television. Directly above my bed are three windows with 12&#34;x&#34;12 glass panels. The television was to the left of my bed. Suddenly, my attention was drawn to the floor approximately four feet from the desk my television was on. What I saw was a beam moving very quickly in small circles in one concentrated spot on my floor. The circle motions it made were not perfect, the best I can describe them as were &#34;wobbly circles&#34;. The beam was solid, pure solid light and approximately an inch wide...it was fairly thin. The color was a pure white with somewhat of a blueish tinge around the outside of the beam. The beam itself was bright, but did not seem to emit any light beyond its edges. My room was NOT filled with light, only this beam. I was able to watch for about 5 seconds before I fled my room in a state of total panic. I was not able to tell exactly which of the three windows the beam was aimed through, but assuming that had it beamed straight into my room onto the wall parallel it would be 90 degrees, I would estimate that it hit my floor at a diagonal angle of about 60 degrees. When I got downstairs, I looked outside to see any evidence of a craft (I have never to my knowledge witnessed a UFO) and there was none. There were no aircraft of any kind besides high-flying commercial planes. I did not tell anyone in my house about what I had seen. I wasn&#39;t sure if my mind was playing tricks on me or what had actually happened, but I saw something. When I checked the area later, there was no evidence whatesoever of the beam having ever touched my floor.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Two days later, on November 3, 2004, I witnessed one more anomalous event which I believe may be connected, and this time my younger brother was also witness. A PITCH black figure, which appeared to be two dimentional, in a very humanoid form quickly passed across a window and wall which were directly in front of where we were sitting, about 12 feet away. The figure had NO discernable features in its face, no clothing, no hair. Just a round head and human like torso were all we were able to make out. It was impossible to make a height estimate. It was for certain INSIDE our house, not a reflection from outside. The sighting of this &#34;being&#34; lasted 3-4 seconds. There was no logical explaination for what we saw, it was most certainly paranormal. I have seen a figure like that once before and I am certain it was of the same nature.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with this witness via telephone, and we found her to be a seemingly quite credible witness.

11/1/04 20:30|Fuquay Varina|NC|Triangle|5 - 10min.|Huge, slow moving, silent, black triangular shaped craft flying at very low altitude.|12/16/05|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/047/S47746.html|318|ndxe200411| Huge, slow moving, silent, black triangular shaped craft flying at very low altitude.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was new to the area at this time and was by myself driving on a two lane road outside of Fuquay Varina, NC.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was a crystal clear night without a moon when I spotted four large round lights glowing softly off to the right side of the road ahead about a quarter of a mile away.  They seemed to be motionless at first and my first thought was that they were lights on top of a communications tower because of the numerous towers in the area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then I realized that tower lights were just small blinking lights there to warn aircraft of their position.  These lights were large, about 3&#39; in diameter, they didn&#39;t blink, and they had a soft glow like a child&#39;s night light, not like a spot light, and they didn&#39;t light up the ground or anything around them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then I noticed they weren&#39;t stationary, but they were moving very slowly towards the road that I was on.  I started to slow down and realized that it was going to cross over the road right over my head if I slowed down enough, which I did.  I rolled down the windows of the car so I could hear it but there was no sound at all.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There were trees lining both sides of the road that obscured my sight of this object as it got nearer to me but I finally slowed down to the point that I came to a complete stop on the road.  I hadn&#39;t seen any other cars on this road at all and hadn&#39;t passed any houses for miles, so it was pretty much an isolated and deserted part of the country, so I was safe to sit at a stop on the road with my car idling, windows down with my head out the window and looking up as the front of this thing appeared over the tree tops and slowly and silently floated overhead.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It wasn&#39;t more than a couple hundred feet high at the most because it wasn&#39;t much higher than the pine trees alongside the road.  Its speed made me think of a blimp cruising along.  It was black and blended in with the pitch black night, making it very hard to see the exact shape of it inspite of being so close, but I could make out what appeared to be panels on the uder side of the craft as the front disappeard over the trees on the opposite side of the road.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It continued to glide in total silence at a very slow speed until the back of the craft appeared over the trees on the right side of the road and then disappeared over the treetops on the left side of the road.  I couldn&#39;t see the whole craft at one time because of the trees so the exact size and shape is hard to determine for sure, but because of my occupation I can be considered a very reliable source for size and shape estimates, and I believe what I saw was in a triangular shape and was at least 300&#39; long and 150&#39; wide.<n> <n><n> <n><n> And the strangest part about it is that as it passed over me not more than 200&#39; to 300&#39; overhead, I didn&#39;t see the four large round lights that first brought my attention to the object.  I was directly under the craft so they might have been located on the sides and not visible from where I looked up at it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have only told a few people about this experience because nobody seems to believe anything that can&#39;t be explained, and that things that don&#39;t fall within our general knowledge of things just can&#39;t be true and must have been imagined.  But I know what I saw and I didn&#39;t imagine anything.<n> <n><n> <n><n> And this wasn&#39;t something that was in the distance either.  It was only a few hundred feet away from me at the most.  It was huge, totally silent, moving very slowly, and because it was either painted black or made of a very dark material it was almost invisible against a black night sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;m glad I finally found a place that I can tell about this experience because it&#39;s been on my mind for the past year and seems so significant that it should be told.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident in November 2004 is approximate.

There were two luminous white dots that were in the southeast and looked liked they were over Malibu Canyon.  One was slightly higher than the other and I watched them for about a minute and they did not move.  They appeared as bright as Venus, however they were much larger.  After about a minute, they pulsed brighter and then they both faded at the same time! I stood there looking in the same area of the sky after they faded to see if I could detect anything moving, however I could not detect any objects moving.  This is not the first time I have witnessed a UFO. I am an amature astronomer and I am very familiar with the night sky and what I saw was not a plane, helicopter, satellite, planet or star!<n>

Next day, I have a slight sunburn and my eyes are really red.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Sighted extremely bright star in the distance after pulling into a parking lot.  I kept watching this object as it seemed to hover in the distance.  At first I thought it was a helicopter whose lights were coming towards me so I watched it for a bit.  It then started coming towards me after about 6 minutes or so and I noticed suddenely two lights appeared, (or were turned on) red and blue, and they started blinking.  I got out of my car and looked straight over at the object as it came toward me and proceeded to come directly overhead and it moved extremely slow.  I noticed there wasn&#39;t any sound that I can remember coming from the object.  As it went directly over my head for the life of me I can&#39;t remember the shape of the object.  This is unusual for me since I am a professional web designer who takes pride in remembering details.  As I was standing there looking up at the object, two elderly ladies came out of the building but didn&#39;t notice the object at all.  The distance from me to the object was approximately 400 feet.  After I looked at the ladies I looked back at the object as it kept moving slowly.  I looked back to the ladies then looked back at the object again and it was gone.  Immediately after going inside the building I noticed my skin was burning a bit and didn&#39;t think much about it until today the day after.  My face appears red, just like a minor sunburn.  It is also still burning a bit and my eyes are also red.  This object was spotted off highway 81 in Bristol VA near the exit 7 area.  Earlier that day near road 700 I saw a black helicopter off in the distance, I had also saw one close to my work place even earlier that same day.  I would think nothing of this except for the fact that I saw the strange object and now have a slight sunburn to prove it.  Unfortunately I did see this object by myself and the elderly ladies didn&#39;t even look up from something they were both reading.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Thought it mught be a weather balloon, but official wind data from NOAA that day indicates winds out of the NW (the direction needed to push a balloon to the east) only at altitudes above 12,000&#39;.  So if the object was at or below 12,000&#39;, it was moving agaisnt the wind.  However, even at 12,000&#39;, the object&#39;s velocity would have been over 310 nautical MPH, approx. 7x the highest recorded wind speed for that day.  My calculations would have to be off by a magnitude of 10 (I&#39;m a mathematician) for this object to have been a balloon.  I can mathematically prove it was not.  I am e-mailing a photo on which I have marked it&#39;s location in each of the 19 shots.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The sky was blue and clear, with strong, gusty winds. About 11:40, I noticed a white object appear above the treeline in front of me. At first, I thought it was a toy balloon or maybe a plastic bag that had been blown aloft by the wind. It became apparent that the object was not being tossed about by the wind, but was proceeding from north to south, straight as an arrow and contrary to the wind direction. It passed almost directly overhead, reflecting the sunlight as it passed. It appeared to be shiny, opaque white, not self-luminous. There were no wings, fins or other protrusions visible. The shape was a short tube with rounded ends, like a vitamin capsule or maybe an aircraft drop tank. I watched it until it disappeared in the distance to the south. I estimate that it was at least several tbousand feet high, as there were jetliners visible in the sky at the same time on approach to LAX and Ontario airport. The airliners appeared much higher that the object. The speed of the object reminded me of a military jet making a pass at an airshow, fast but not supersonic. There was no noticeable noise from the object, but there was a lot of background noise due to the wind in the trees. At one point, the object passed over, or maybe through, a cloud of dust which has been carried aloft by the wind, and it appeared to either make a wake throught it or cast a shadow on it as it passed.

11/1/04 05:30|Taylor Mill|KY|Disk|3 min|On my left hand side, out of my driver window there was an extemly large circular shaped object sitting around 100 feet up in the sky.|12/12/09|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/072/S72828.html|325|ndxe200411| I was driving down 3L highway early in the morning on my way too work.  The speedlimit there is about 45 miles per hour.  During the morining hours people usually go around 55 miles per hour.  I was coming through what I will call the cut in the hill on 3L highway borderline Taylor Mill and Ft Wright as I was getting ready to cross a bridge.  The bridge does not look like a bridge but just part of the roadway.  I was headed northbound.  On my left hand side, out of my driver window there was an extemly large circular shaped object sitting around 100 feet up in the sky.  It was dark in color and fit closely with the darkened sky. There are really no street lights through the area or at least there was not at the time.  As I noticed the object I slowed my speed.  So did the three or four other cars behind me and in front of me. There is a passing lane.  No one passed.  Others had to see it as well as myself.  I recall looking up and seeing very dimly lit light! s.  There were three of them and they were in the formation of electric stove burners.  The color was very dim orange.  From what I gathered the object was huge similiar to Independence Day UFO&#39;s in regards to its&#39; size.  The bottom of it must have been what was visible to me. It was not even hovering.  If an object were to hover you would see some slight movement.  This thing actually sat in the sky as if it belonged there. At that point I looked in the backseat of my car at my two infant childen and decided not too stop.  If they had not been with me, I would have pulled over.  At the time I was in a custody battle and never reported the incident.  As I went further down 3L and approached highway 275, I lost sight of the object in my rearview mirrors.  I was hoping once I got onto the highway headed eastbound and on the bridge, that I would see it again and I did not.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date is approximate.
