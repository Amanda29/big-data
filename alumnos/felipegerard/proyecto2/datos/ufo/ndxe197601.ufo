I said to my co-workers, &#34;lets go over there and view the area were the event happened.&#34;  I was told you could not get in there because the millitary had closed the area off.  I thought it would make interresting reading in the local paper that evening but nothing was ever said about it.  So as a result folks kind of put it out of thier minds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> However, later that spring, there were reports of a small strange being in the local paper dubbed &#34;the creature&#34; sighted and reported to the Millis and I think Dover Police by some High School students.  the drawings looked very much like our little friends that everybody sketches today.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It has been a long time since this incident but I bet you could get more info from the town locals there.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I would be more than happy to speak with any investigatore of this sort of thing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date may be approximate, although the witness does not indicate that fact.

1/11/76 23:00|Fairbanks, Trans Alaskan Pipeline haul road 250 mi N of|AK||10 minutes|Large white light traversing tundra that approached myself and friend.|11/23/99|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/011/S11108.html|3|ndxe197601| Large white light traversing tundra that approached myself and friend.<n> <n><n> <n><n> While working as a truck driver on the Trans Alaskan Pipeline construction north of the Prospect Creek construction camp my assistant and I were on break reading by the interior light of our truck.  We were about one half mile from a group of about forty workers putting support members in the ground for the pipeline.  My partner pointed out a bright light on a mountain directly across from us about 40 miles away.  As we watched the light it appeared to &#34;step&#34; down in four moves to the bottom of the mountain.  It then came towards us accross the treeless tundra (light got larger than the moon which was visible), stopped, and went back to just a bit to the right of the original mountain site.  The light did this three more times (about three seconds each trip) as if searching the tundra.  As the light came closer the last time, I turned on the spotlight and directed it towards the light.  It approached us coming to about a quarter mile away and slowly came closer.  The light was then about three times the size of the moon.  As it was getting closer we got scared, shut off the spotlight and sped off down the haul road. We could see the light at its present size accompanying us on our left side the two miles to the construction camp.  We slid in to the warm-up shack and ran inside where there were about ten men  on break.  We all went outside to see what it was but it was gone.  The next morning at breakfast it was found that many people had seen this &#34;light&#34; and truckers coming up the haul road could see a large red light on the back of the craft.  No description of the body of this craft was given because of the darkness.  I was transferred to another camp a couple of days later but was told that many people were interviewed by Air Force representatives from Eilson AFB in Fairbanks.  I have always wondered if this event was recorded anywhere as it made a firm believer out of me.<n>

I am 40 years old now.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My Dad had just left 10 minutes before hand for work at the sawmill.  My Mom, sister, brother and I were out riding our olympic snowmobile in the field near our house.  Everyone decided to go inside and I thought I would go for one more round on the field.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I turned around in the yard and headed back down into the field when I saw, above the trees and back a ways (i really couldn&#39;t say how far..like maybe 500 yards or so) at the far end of our field, a bright glowing , all red craft of some kind.  It&#39;s shape was saucer like but it also flared out on each side like curved protrusions.  I was absolutly flabberghasted...couldn&#39;t beleive my eyes. (I was interested in ufo&#39;s even back then and used to take books out of the library on them quite often)<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was stationary in the sky and I can&#39;t say if there was sound because of the ski-doo engine. This object was all the same brightly glowing red colorthroughout....no other lights or changes in hue...all the same. Of course it scared me instantly cause I thought it might come after me....so I turned that snowmobile around as fast as i could, went back up to the house, jumped off her and removed the key before she even quit moving I think, ran into the house, jumped up onto the kitchen cupboard to see if i could see it again through the window, but it was gone.  If it had still been there, I would have deffinately been able to see it from that vantage point.<n> <n><n> <n><n> That experience has run through my mind over and over ever since.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of the incident is approximate.

She was walking across the parking lot of an apt house on haywood lane, when she became aware of a large, bronze triangular craft floating right over her head. she said it was completely silent.  she stood in awe watching this thing until it flew past her. she said nothing about lights or any other traits, just that it looked to be bronze and it was a triangle.<n> <n><n> <n><n> my niece has a very high-IQ and is not known to report anything like this for any reason other than to report what she has seen.  about 20 years later, i happened by &#39;coincidence&#39; to find another person in the Briley Pkwy area of Nashville who claimed to have seen the very same thing during the same year.

1/6/76 01:00|Cannon AFB|NM|Disk|Weeks|Air Force scrambles armed fighters after "bogeys" and subsequent cover-up (1976)|10/30/06|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/051/S51565.html|7|ndxe197601| Air Force scrambles armed fighters after &#34;bogeys&#34; and subsequent cover-up (1976)<n> <n><n> <n><n> This event was for me a culmination of about 2 weeks of unusual activity during my duty as USAF personnel at Cannon AFB, NM.  Preceeding this, there were reports of cattle mutilation near Gallup.  I personally interviewed at least 20 witnesses.  While minor details of the craft would vary - and a few of the descriptions were of a small red sphere - the basic description/behavior of the main sightings were virtually identical.  I also spent an evening interviewing a family of 5 who spent the previous evening watching the &#34;silver discs&#34; hovering over the field behind their house in Clovis.<n> <n><n> <n><n> One of the more interesting episodes was when aircraft were launched near shift change.  I worked swing shift and on Friday nights if aircraft land with avionics problems, swing shift worked over rather than calling in midnight shift from their weekend.  As usual, we had verified sorties by Job Control and there were no scheduled training flights.  When I heard the sound of F-111 afterburners, I ran to the loading dock to see if they were ours (not Nellis or Mountain Home F-111&#39;s) and saw the &#34;CC&#34; designation on the tail as two Cannon AFB F-111D models launched abreast.  This was the first time I had seen 111&#39;s launch in that formation - it was definitely unusual.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Our shop dispatcher immediately called Job Control, upset that our weekend would likely be postponed as we waited for the aircraft to land and likely land with repairs needed.   ((name and rank deleted)) hung up the phone and told us that the launch was no training sortie - it was a &#34;hot scramble&#34;.  This means the aircraft were launched with live ordinance!!  When we inquired as to why, he said they were tracking bogeys.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Again, I ran out to the loading dock platform and began scanning the skies.  I saw nothing.  I went back into the A-shop waiting area and ((name deleted)) recalled that a buddy of his was the radar operator on duty.  We called the &#34;radar shack&#34; and got him on the phone.  He said he had never seen anything like this.  The bogeys would appear and disappear, seemingly without cause and would occasionally move at incredible speeds over and near the base.  We asked him if it could be a radar malfunction.  He said &#34;negative&#34; - the radar was in perfect working order and he had run diagnostics.  He also was a seasoned operator and I do not believe it was an error on his part (after all, we DID scramble two $26,000,000 aircraft after something).  I jotted down the phone number to the radar shack - on the off chance....<n> <n><n> <n><n> The two aircraft landed about 90 minutes later and surprisingly, had no repairs that would require us to work over.  I left the shop and went to the Airman&#39;s club on base, had a few beers and played some fooseball.  I left for the barracks and arrived in the CQ (charge of quarters) area at around 02:00.  I noted the phone on the desk and decided, what the heck.  I dialed the number to the radar shack and here is my account of what transpired, with my comments:  (ring-ring) VOICE (excited and loud): &#34;This is Capt.((name deleted)) - IDENTIFY YOURSELF!&#34; [OK, in the USAF you do not answer a phone that way.  Even Generals do not answer phones that way - it could be the President.  Everyone is taught protocol - &#34;This is &lt;rank&gt; &lt;name&gt;, ma&#39;am or sir.  How may I help you?&#34;  Also, the odds of a Captain being in the middle of a cow pasture in a small radar building at 02:00 on a Friday night is really slim.]  ME: &#34;This is ((name and rank deleted)).&#34;  [I almost hung up.  I knew upon hearing his voice I was in trouble.]  VOICE: &#34;State your business, ((name and rank deleted))!&#34;  ME: &#34;I was wondering if there were any more bogeys sighted?&#34;  VOICE: &#34;Who told you there were bogeys sighted?!?&#34;  ME: &#34;I spoke to the radar operator earlier - we scrambled two aircraft...&#34;  VOICE: &#34;I don&#39;t know what you are talking about - there were no bogeys and no scramble.&#34;  ME: &#34;I saw them take off...&#34;  VOICE: [Begins to yell and curse - like a sailor!  I mean REALLY bad - very hostile towards me].  Who is your C.O.?  [In the USAF, we don&#39;t have a &#34;C.O.&#34; or Commanding Officers - we have Squadron Commanders but since my father was ((deleted--military))  for ((XX))  yrs., I knew what he meant.  This was my first clue that this guy was fishy.]  ME: ((name deleted)) sir.&#34;  VOICE: &#34;And what is your serial number?&#34; [Strike two - no such thing as serial number in the USAF at that time.  It was replaced years earlier by the SSAN - social security account number.  NOBODY called it serial number because that was a throwback to the &#34;brown shoe days&#34; of the Army Air Corps - which was very past tense and a history the modern Air Force would just as soon forget.  But again, I knew what he wanted so I complied without questioning the use of terms.  At that point, I knew this guy was not USAF.]  ME: &#34;((number deleted))&#34;  VOICE: &#34;What you are talking about never happened.  You are a lying &lt;curse-curse-curse&gt; and I can prove it.  I&#39;ll have you  busted - yell-curse-yell-curse.  I will be watching your every move, Airman.  You are not to mention a word of this to anyone, ever.  AM I CLEAR??&#34;  ME: &#34;Yes sir.&#34;  VOICE: &#34;We know where you work, we know where you are - if you communicate any of this bullshit story you have concocted, I will make sure you end up in a place worse than Leavenworth.&#34;  [Leavenworth is as bad as it can (legally) get for an errant military person.  I fully took this as a physical threat.  It was not spoken plainly but it was as clear to me as it was to him.]  During the days after this conversation we received an order from the Base Commander, citing USAFReg 111-(?) which I looked up in the base library.  Basically, it says that no information regarding any unidentified flying object can be communicated to anyone under threat of court martial.  I also kept running the conversation with ((name and rank deleted)) over in my mind.  Something was wrong with it all.  I also became upset with his conduct.  As an officer, he stepped over the line - big time.  I began considering bringing him up on charges of conduct unbecoming.<n> <n><n> <n><n> With anger and indignance as emotional bulwarks, I began to search for this ((name and rank deleted)).  Despite an exhaustive search on and off base, there was no such person.  I thought maybe the guy at the radar shack knew him.  When I called for him, I was told by his Sgt. that he had been transferred out.  I told him it was important I get in touch with him and was told he had been sent TDY to destinations unknown.  I detected this Sgt. was &#34;touchy&#34; about this situation.  His voice and behavior were showing signs of stress.  When I said that I didn&#39;t reacall him mentioned having orders, the Sgt abruptly ended the conversation.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So, who was this ((name and rank deleted))?  I don&#39;t know but I suspect he works for a non-military, extra-governmental agency that is directly involved in the supression of the evidence surrounding UFO phenomenon.  I never heard from him nor do I suspect anyone was actually watching me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Several days passed by and the UFO sightings seemed to diminish in frequency.  One night, after midnight, I was driving back to base from Clovis on Hwy 60.  I noticed some flashing lights over the base that seemed to be hovering.  I figured they are Jolly Greens (Sikorsky HH-3E helicopters) that land there to refuel from time to time.  (BTW, I am an aviation expert and private pilot in addition to fmr. USAF)  As I approach the exit to the base, I notice the lights - 2 sets - are still hovering over the base.  This struck me as curious because they would never hold that long over the base at this time of night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I begin to wonder if this could be UFOs.  I begin to watch intently, glancing at the road occasionally.  As I move closer, I can make out 2 outlines of disk shapes, with a perimiter of multi-colored lights that appear to be on the very edge of the disks.  They are either moving around the ship or strobing in such a way to give that impression.  The objects also are moving - hovering - moving.  I notice that there seems to be no acceleration curve in their movement.  It is instantaneous, linear ON-OFF.  I make a correllation - the speed the lights appear to be moving &#39;round the ship increases, then the ship moves - then the lights slow down again.  I see bright blue lights out of the corner of my left eye.  The power lines along the hwy. are exploding (or maybe a transformer) and huge blue balls of arc light are thrown onto the hwy in front of my car.  I reflexively dodge them.  Looking back in the rear view, I notice a small fire is beginning.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I look back at the skies over the base.  Only one ship is left.  Regret letting the other &#34;get away&#34; and watch the last ship without averting my gaze for anything.  Yes, I call them &#34;ships&#34; because now, I believe that is what they are.)  The lights on this one begin to rotate faster and faster until the multi-colors &#34;meld&#34; into a ring then ball of bright white (this happens in like one second or less - multi-color ring &gt; meld to white ring &gt; burst into incredible PURE WHITE ball of light- like no light I&#39;ve seen) and it streaks past horizon in a split second.  On the flat desert, clear night, 500&#39; altitude (est.) - you figure the speed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I pull over and open the driver&#39;s door of my Buick.  Dazed - absolutely stunned - my world has just been turned on its head.  Everything I know is wrong.  There is also something like a &#34;force&#34; that compels me to commit every detail of this evening to memory because one day it will be important.  I don&#39;t know why but it will be important one day.  The next Monday, the Clovis newspaper had a small report of an &#34;unexplained blackout&#34; on the east side of town that night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((name deleted)) Consulting Engineer Fmr.

Gardens - somewhere downtown when we noticed that everyone on the streets had stopped and were looking up at the clouds.  My dad pulled over and we got out and saw flashes of lights behind the cloud cover, yellow, blue, green, red just various colors flashing one after the other which made the cloud looked colored. My mon got scared and jumped back into the car and told us boys to get in... I was amazed as I continued to watch until my dad told us to get in.  I&#39;m not sure of the exact date but I was there when it was reported all over the papers and dismissed as a weather balloon... yeah right!  I was very young then, but I won&#39;t forget the colors within the clouds.<n>
