I thought i was seeing satellite photos being taken. Then I noticed across from it, at a distance of possibly 100 feet, the same thing, and again at a third p[oint, making a triangle shape.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In between the lights, was darkness, no stars could be seen.As we watched, we could see this object, which may have been up to 2000 feet in the sky, was moving very slowly to the east.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date of sighting is approximate.
