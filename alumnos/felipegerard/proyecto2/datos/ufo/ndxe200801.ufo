Not really sure what it is i saw, there we no lights coming from either object, and they moved so fast it&#39;s like they disappeared. The is one other witness that was in my truck with me that also see this<n>

I saw what appeared to be two small dots hover up into the sky.  I was in the industrious part of Irvine where there are many buildings, so the horizon line was out of sight to me.  These two dots appeared to be disks.  One was more aggresive than the other and they would glow a very bright blue/white(similar to those new headlights cars have nowadays) and a few times turned very red(just like a brake light).  Four other of my co-workers witnessed this as well.  About one hour later, another co-worker who moves our trucks for us(we work in a warehouse) saw the objects as well.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I work nights and our shift takes lunch from 9:30 to 10pm.  When I saw these objects I waved a co-worker over to see them.  I also work near an airport, John Wayne, and remember thinking that those dots were planes.  But they were far to high in the sky and they seemed to be rising and hovering in the same area.  As stated before, they would glow extremely bright.  The &#34;dots&#34; looked more like a disk from time to time, mainly when the would glow brighter.  Seriously, I have no explanation what they could be.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I ran outside to see neighbors across the street looking outside too. Then I could see the craft were 2 Apache helicopters flying very low at 500-1000 ft. They were flying in formation and obviously were not in whisper mode. They had no visible lights or typical lights on, I could only see them due to the light reflection. I thought this was strange since there are no bases nearby. I could hear them for about 5 minutes before they flew over the development. No other aircraft were visible in the vicinity at the time.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I would guess that the altitude was around 1500 –2000 ft.  The object was moving in a very straight line, with no changes in direction that I could tell.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was no sound, and no lights.  I thought this was odd, because my location is approximately 3 miles due west of Port Columbus (Ohio) International Airport, in-line with the runways.  Planes are regularly approaching or taking off directly overhead, all day, everyday.  Today they have been on the approach path.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Adding to my concern was the realization that the wind was blowing the opposite direction that the object was moving. See below a copy of the National Weather Service report for Columbus, OH that I cut and pasted below.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is the first time I have ever seen something like this that didn’t have a rational explanation.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 31° Overcast	Feels Like27° 	Reporting Station: KCMHRelative Humidity: 33%Wind: 70° (ENE) at 8mphGusts: 0mphPressure: 30.3inYesterday&#39;s Precip: inYesterday&#39;s Low Temp: 15°FYesterday&#39;s High Temp: 46°F	Dew Point: 5°Visibility: 10miCeiling: 9000ftHeat Index: 31°Wind Chill: 23°6hr Precip: in6hr Low Temp: 16°F6hr High Temp: 28°F  Raw Report Data: KCMH 311951Z 07007KT 10SM OVC090 M01/M15 A3031 RMK AO2 SLP276T10061150<n>

It was as large as a small jet but it was round and I watch it passed and go out of site. It was maybe 150 feet about the water. It had no lights. It passed just by the power plant next door.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Upon looking up, I noticed what looked like a perfectly round white balloon travelling in a perfect straight line in a westerly direction. This caught my attention as I knew balloons don’t usually travel through the sky this way.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I mentioned to my co-workers to look up at what I thought was a balloon, the object was continuing in the straight line but was slowing to a complete stop, at about 15 degrees from directly above us, towards the north. We agreed that the object was being too stable for a balloon that was at that high altitude. At this time, my co-workers mentioned that the object was actually spinning in an elliptical fashion, like an egg being spun on counter, with a slight wobble.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After pausing at the spot for about 15 to 20 seconds, it proceeded to slowly rise at a very steep angle until it was out of sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We scoured the Net the following week for any indication of other people seeing what we saw, or if it was any other explainable phenomenon, natural or otherwise, but did not see any reports.<n>

The reason for this is because there is a municipal airport runway behind our building that is used for sky jumping. So as we where looking for jumpers we saw an object that the first witness thought was a balloon. The object was moving horizontal in a westerly direction, too fast and straight for a balloon, then slowed down to a complete stop where the other two witnesses noticed that it was spinning (this is how we could see the shape was oval because it looked like and egg spinning on the counter). Then it just slowly ascended into the sky where it vanished from view.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We waited for a few days to see if it would be reported, but have not read or seen any thing in the local news or online.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous;  provides no contact information.

When i heard i noise, I looked outside to see what it was and there was a circular object moving at speeds I have never seen before. (miles with in 15 seconds)  There was only one small white light that was not blinking.  The object was just over the tree tops, I thought that it was going to hit the trees or my barn.  It didn&#39;t have anyway of seeing, there was only a small little white light on what looked to be the bottom.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When it passed through, I heard it when it was only about 50 f.t. away.  It passed over me so fast that i couldn&#39;t get a good look at it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I went around my barn in the direction it was coming from and it was almost 2 miles away.  Then when it went over the mountains the was a very bright light coming from were it had went above the mountain.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then there were 2 planes that came a minute or so apart from each other and 2 or so minutes from when I had lost sight to the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I do not know if the other planes had anything to do with what I thought was a UFO.<n>

I was driving eastbound on I88 going through Lisle, Illinois on my was to work.  Just to my slight right so probably a Southeastern direction I was this solid light.  The light looked as if it was many miles away and somewhat high in the sky.  It was round and was very white but looked filtered as if it was through clouds or fog around it, but there were no clouds at that time.  As I watched the light it suddenly became 4-10 times larger then its initial size in less then a second.  A few seconds later the light returned to its original size and as I was grabbing my video camera I looked up and it was gone.  This all took place over a period of about 10 seconds.  I am a firefighter and I have never seen anything close to this in my life.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Large lights. NO SOUND AT ALL. I closed the door, and had my daughter come to the door and check to make sure that I wan&#39;t a nut, and she saw the same thing. Very scary. We closed the door and went back to the patio door, just in time to see this object leaving. Very wide, and one large light in the back middle portion of this thing. Still heard no noise. This thing was just above the top of the trees, so it was very close. Was low enough to shine the lights into house.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

1/30/08 21:00|Advance|NC|Other|approx=3-4hrs|Organized movement of mulitple lights/objects....in a circular pattern.  ((NUFORC Note:|2/14/08|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/061/S61355.html|18|ndxe200801| Organized movement of mulitple lights/objects....in a circular pattern<n> <n><n> <n><n> January 30 8:45pm – 1:30am   I go outside every night. I always look at the stars. I love to try to find the different constellations in the sky…On Wednesday January 30 at about 8:45 I was watching the sky and I noticed a particularly bright star in the southern sky that I have never seen...and didn&#39;t see the night before… as I was watching it seemed as if the star was getting closer and moving slightly...I did work all day so…I rubbed my eyes and the stars light had expanded into a crescent shaped light. I called for my boyfriend and my father to come out side and see….The more I looked at it there was no way that the light was high enough to be a plane and it seemed to be hovering and moving slowly. I went inside and continued to look out the sliding glass door. There was a light coming from the top of the tree line coming from the north traveling south. The light was not a color that I know but it reminds me of halogen head lights. Sort of blue-ish. But not like a light on a plane…not blinking…just steady…but to clear to be a headlight. The object continued over the tree line and then began traveling towards the crescent shaped light.  As the object passed by there was a series of lights on the back of the object. I again called for my family they also saw the object but could not identify was it was and there was no sound at all for it to be a plane or helicopter….and moved to slow…across the sky…it was so strange. I continued to watch and multiple smaller objects began to appear. Similar to the one that had come from the tree line and but smaller in size moving faster with more erratic type of movements. There were probably 7 or 8 of them at different points in the sky. They seemed to cross the sky in formation…and to move with purpose as if they were being instructed to do what they were doing…..They hovered at a point for a moment and then they began to fly around the sky going in a circular patter flying from west to east passing close to the crescent light and then moving on, sometimes moving in a zig zag pattern. At one po! int an o bject came from the crescent light. There were three small bright lights it hovered for a moment. My eyes caught a bright flashing light coming from the woods. The light was a sort of off white color…it streaked across and then the light went up into the sky….I saw the same object that I saw leave the crescent shaped light begin to move to above where the lights from the woods were. It hovered around there just above the tree line and then it would move back to the crescent light. Then back again….this continued for a while…While this was going on the other objects were continuing to move in their circular formation. They would occasionally dart around. But for the most part they made their circle around the crescent light. I was beginning to become very frightened. Normally you can hear things in the woods…Animals scurrying around leaves blowing….something…..but it was dead silent. No wind no nothing just the cold and these moving lights. I finally had to make myself go to bed this was about 1:30am. But I was so frightened I slept in the living room. I don’t know what those things were….and I don’t know what they were doing but they weren’t planes…and they weren’t helicopters. There is a small airport close to our house…and I see planes and such all the time pass by often….I have looked at the sky at my home every night of my life and I have seen anything like these things that have been happening. The next morning…when I was driving my daughter to school I the clouds were in the sky but I could see little silver lights…while I was driving…as I was turning into her school my car shut of for no reason…my car is in perfect running condition…and has never shut off before….I am just really scared with all the things that have been happening….like this for instance.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have been noticing these lights in the woods…down below the tree line…but I had been passing them off as light coming from the woods from my neighbors or car lights just to make myself feel better about them. But when I saw the light streak and then go into the sky I know now what I have been seeing is not car lights or light from neighbors….About 4-6 weeks ago I was outside and I saw a bright light flash in the tree line…it wasn’t a camera it wasn’t a car b/c there is about 6 acres of trees that way….The light wasn’t coming from the ground it was coming from about halfway up into the trees….I was even with me and I was standing on the second story of the house on the deck….facing out over our pond….and the light came from the trees on the backside of the pond. I called for my father….and he came out and saw it flash again….I kind of jumped back….he was amazed as I was because of where it was coming from it just didn’t really leave any explanation for what it was.  The type of light it was it really what was so odd….it isn’t a flash it pulsed….grew stronger and then vanished….but the light that we saw that night was the same kind of light that was on these objects….then moments later I was going back into the house to get our flashlight…and the light pulsed again.( from the same place that the light went up into the sky on Wednesday night) there is no way that someone could have moved that fast through the woods its over 100yd from the place the light pulsed the first time to the place where I saw it the last time….its thick wooded area with creeks and tress brush. And there was no sound. Dead quiet. The light didn’t pulse again that night that I saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Yesterday I went to take my daughter to see my grandmother. I asked them if they had noticed anything odd in the sky last night. I asked them because they live about 1/10 of a mile from my home.  They both said no….but my grandmother said that the week before she had seen a very bright strange light that had gone down into the trees and then moved back up into the sky….She said that she was so astounded because she had never seen anything like that before.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I don’t know what all of this is….but I know its something…I am having to laugh at myself a little to keep myself from being so frightened…because I have seen what I thought might be a UFO before and thought…oh cool a ufo look at that. But I am really really frightened by what took place on Wednesday night at my home….These objects moved to organized with too much purpose…they moved like they were doing something…. Last night it rained…I didn’t see the lights in the sky because of low cloud cover but I did see the light in the trees.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am 25 years old. I have lived in this house most of my life. My father is 50. My boyfriend is 22. My grandmother is 83<n>

I live out away from the city and right before I reached my street I saw a light flying through the night sky and dismissed it as a helicopter since it seemed to have a spotlight. Then I realized that it was flying much too fast to be a helicopter. It flew in a giant loop from parallel to the main street, then made a right turn and flew across to where there is a lit up cross on a hill. At this point another flying object which had three lights and also flew much faster than anything I have ever seen appeared and was following the first craft. They both turned right, finishing the loop, and as far as I could see...disappeared. I don&#39;t know if these were military craft being tested or what, but they definitely were nothing normal to our area. We do have an airport down the road but the planes going/ coming there NEVER come out this far and do not fly as fast as what I saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

My daughter and me were out in order to watch the transit of the space station.  The Space Station was due to pass by on the north at about 7:30pm that night.  We waited until the space station came by.  As the space station approached from the West and just as the station passed due north we both noticed a bright flash at about the same level as the space station.  Then we noticed another flash at the level below the space station.  This happened just as the space station approached due north of our location.  Just after the second flash, the space station disapeared behind the earths shadow as the Sun was at 20 degrees below the horizon at this time.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was traveling in a SSE direction. I took photos, due to the range I did not zoom in. So they don’t do the object justice. Let me know where to send a copy of the best photo taken. It was within view for approximately 8-10 minutes, until we lost visual over the trees.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

At 12:40 we heard a noise like rustling leaves that got louder and louder. We looked to the southwest and in the sky was an sphere-like object that was descending at about 25 M.P.H. onto a pasture. An orb of flourescent purple light was rotating around the object inside what seemed to be a kind of tube. As the object slowed down, so did the speed at which the purple orb revolved around the craft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After it had sat there for a couple minutes, another sphere shaped craft came down and landed next to the other. The second craft made the same noise as the first. They seemed to be docking with one another.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At about 5 minutes they both made the rustling noise again. They did that for about 45 seconds, and then they flew off into the air much faster than they had landed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We checked out the spots where they had landed the next morning. Under where the craft had landed, much of the grass was now dry and brown.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Probable hoax.  PD))<n>

After about 20 minutes of watching, it began to move around in zigzag and circular patterns.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As it moved around and came closer, we were able to discern the object was crescent shaped.

In particular, I was shocked that not more have been reported (regarding these crazy lights that fade and appear again) but I read the Monee report and felt relieved that someone else had been noticing this.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This has been going on for MONTHS and I just am now getting around to reporting this. Who else do you report this to?? At any rate, this is what I have been experiencing on a REGULAR basis.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I work in Kankakee and live in Beecher. Every night when I travel home, I take a certain route (typically I-57 North to the Peotone/Wilmington exit and then take Cicero [Rt. 50] North until I get to &#34;Beecher Blacktop&#34; Road and travel east on that road until I get to &#34;Will Center&#34; Road I believe it&#39;s called.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Since it is dark out where I live (mostly cornifelds and some houses but no street lights for long stretches at a time) I can see all the stars very clearly and helicopters on occassion or small aircraft flying along with commercial aircraft flying at higher altitudes in the distance.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I would say at least 2-3 times a week back in October, November, December of 2007 I have noticed these &#34;lights&#34; that appear in a &#34;V&#34; formation but are spread pretty far apart. It&#39;s like they are &#34;pointing&#34; towards the race track (Balmoral Race Track). The lights will sometimes be 2 or 3 and the most I have seen was around 7 lights that are very distinct and very bright. And then all of a sudden, it&#39;s like someone turns the lights out. But they fade out typically.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It is really hard to describe. The one night, I was on the phone with my boyfriend and I saw these BRIGHT lights that were not moving, they were not planes, the only thing I could think of was maybe a helicopter or two (or 6) but they were just hovering. Not making a sound. But when I pulled into the area where I live, I got out of the car and there was NO SOUND. I know when a helicopter is in the area because you can obviously hear it coming/going. There was NO SOUND coming from these lights and they were constant.<n> <n><n> <n><n> One light in particular (on this night back in October 2007) seemed to be &#34;leading&#34; the other lights. There was a dominant light and it remained constant in its shining and brightness. The other lights (from what I remember 6 others) had formed a &#34;V&#34; shape and it was perfect spacing and it was pointing towards the race track. One of the lights in the V formation would fade out slowly - completely disappear. Then another one would go out. Then another. Then one of the lights that &#34;went out&#34; would come back on.  IT WAS SO STRANGE!!!  Like I said, I was sitting on the phone with my boyfriend and he was asking me to tell him what they were doing. He said to stay there and observe them. I didn&#39;t like the feeling I was getting of &#34;being watched&#34; but I stayed and watched a little more. I knew they weren&#39;t stars as I know where all the stars are and how bright they are, etc.  I couldn&#39;t stand it anymore and went in the house, all the lights in the sky remained where they were.  Very weird.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Other nights when I have driven that route (traveling towards Balmoral race track in Crete, IL) the same thing would happen where there would be 2 or 3 lights one night, 3 or 4 the next night and then they wouldn&#39;t show up at all. The light would be VERY BRIGHT, constant, and then ALL OF A SUDDEN they would shut off.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I was sitting there looking up at the stars, ( the sky was clear and no wind) a typical thing for me to do, and all of the sudden there was this dark thing flying over our heads.  Just as I said what the heck is that, my 10 year old son looked up and saw the same thing.  It was moving at a slow steady pace.  It was dark out so there was just enough light to make out the outline of this object.  I say object but really it looked more like some kind of creature, not an inanimate craft.  As far as size goes, being dark it was hard to judge the distance in height, but it appeared to definitely be above the tree line but lower than an airplane that is usually way up there.  It was probably about 20-30 feet in length and 15 feet wide. Around the time of the sighting, an airplane did go by on the other side of my house, it was flying kind of low as it was coming in to land.  It had all it’s lights on and I would say this thing was probably as high as that plane.  It was dark in color, kind of an ashy blackish brown color.   From my point of view, (directly under it) it didn’t appear to have wings, and was sort of lumpy around the edges, kind of like a blob.  It’s belly looked to be very smooth and flat, sort of like the belly of a stingray.  It had no lights, no sound, it was totally silent and was gliding very smoothly through the sky.  It had what I would describe as a tail although it just looked a little more narrow than the body of it. We were able to watch it for about 3 -5 minutes before it was out of our view.  I know this was not a bird, not a balloon, it was not a hawk or an eagle, or a flock of geese.  It reminded me much of a creature  from the ocean, such as a whale.    I don’t have any photos of it, when I saw it I couldn’t take my eyes off of it.  I was stunned and very curious.  I have drawn a picture to the best of my artistic ability (which isn’t saying much) but you will be able to get! the ide a.   I have been looking now for it to come back and if it does I will get an actual picture of it.  Thank you.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The story of my sighting Witness #2 It all started when my mom looked up and I looked up too, and what I saw was … a dark colored unidentified flying object, flying slow through the air and it was heading north.  When we went in we looked up to try and see if we could see it again but we never did.<n>

It was a triangle shaped craft with 3 lights. A 4th light was off to the left of the triangle. All of the lights were an Amber or Orange that were very bright. The 3 lights on the triangle were around 20 or 30 feet apart and the light off to the side was around 50 to 70 feet away. They were hovering, not moving, and made no sound from what I could hear. We went into a store for around 5 minutes and when we returned, the craft was gone. As we turned onto the next road and headed east. As I tooked into the sky to find it again, a small light caught my eye. The sky was extremely clear, not a star or cloud out. It was dark, however, and very black. The light that was off to the side of the original triangle was following us down the road but at a safe distance. The object was high in the sky in front of the car and was still the Amber or Orange color.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I dimly saw other crafts behind it, but I couldn’t get to see them very well. Then my brother came and saw another that seemed to have 2 bright white lights, then a third appeared as if the craft’s angle was changing. This one also appeared as a triangle, and headed westward.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The object was obviously high above the earth and did not appear to be  moving from it&#39;s general position. Which was not far above the tree line and to the SE of my position when first noticed it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I went and grabbed my astronomical binoculars and returned with it not having appeared to move. I focused on the craft and clearly made out intense bright lights which varied in pattern and color. The colors appeared to be red, green and white. The white light seemed particularly intense. There was a variation in speed of color change and pattern change. As well as varied patterns. Though hard to be certain it did appear to be a circle perhaps a sphere? But due to some of the patterns and the manner they appeared it seemed a circle. Honestly hard to be sure of a dark shape against a dark sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The lights however were very visible and easy to make out as well as certain patterns. For example a circle of light alone made up of lights appearing to be on the edge of the craft. As well as patterns appearing on what appeared to be the bottom and a mixture of the two. It did seem to move but not in a rotational &#34;flying&#34; manner. It seemed to only move across the sky very slow as though stationary. As it was first noticed from the front walk and was followed over the hours to the side and back.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was another witness whom I called out to confirm what I was seeing and followed it off and on for the duration as well. They too used astronomical binoculars and actually were kind of startled. They could make out the lights and the changing of patterns and intensity as well. Though never under the impression that it was the ISS as I have observed it. We confirmed the ISS was not in the area. Further when it is it does not exactly linger. Likewise with satellites which it could not be for several reasons. Nor was it any type of airplane or helicopter. First it was far too high and second I live near an airport. I know what a plane and a chopper in the sky look like. Not to mention both actually went by as well in the course of the night and the difference was glaring to say the least.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The sighting actually continues as I write this. This is now 1-30-08. It appeared in the same place and followed the same path tonight. I would imagine it could have been there last night too. It was overcast so I don&#39;t know.<n>

Clear blue skies were present. I was outside my office and I looked up at a passing commercial jet.  As the jet passed over, it flew by a stationary bright (white in color) object, I could not tell the actual size or altitude of the object. Based on my observation it appeared to be slightly larger than the jet with no wings. It did not have a well defined shape, but it was close to rectangular with lumps on each side. It was sort of blurry with no sharp edges.  I don&#39;t think it was the same altitude of the jet because the passing aircraft did not alter course. The object could have been above or below the aircraft. The distance between the jet and object was about the width of a pencil held at arms length. At first glance I thought maybe it was a clump of balloons; however when I took out my cell phone camera to snap a picture and looked back u! p, the object had vanished.  I knew where to look because the aircraft contrail was still present.  I searched for it for another 5 minutes, but could not locate. I wish I had kept my eyes on it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Note:  This event occurred in January 2008 and had made note of immediately afterward.  I’m just now reporting because I wasn’t aware of this site.  Also, I&#39;m a retired USAF SNCO (1981-2001) and very familiar with all types of aircraft.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It headed North for approx 15 seconds, than disappeared again behind tree line.   Have never seen anything like this...must of been 10-15 times the size of a normal airplane in the air within at least a few miles of interstate.  It didn&#39;t look like any blimp I have ever seen..wasn&#39;t oval at all, but more sphere like with a smaller top.  I am embarrassed to say that it looked just like pictures of UFO&#39;s I&#39;ve seen in the news latey.  I couldn&#39;t believe myself.  I am not the type to report this, but it was just to amazing not to.  I am a professional.  A ((deleted--thirties)) year old married mother.  I am a ((deleted--health care professional)) and my husband is a ((deleted--health care professional)) in Jacksonville.  I would most definitely not make this up.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This was not a blimp..growing up in Florida, I have seen many, many blimps, rockets, space shuttles, etc...especially since my father was a ((deleted--aerospace worker)) and I lived in Cape Canaveral most of my childhood.  This thing was going very, very, very fast...much, much faster than any blimp could travel.  It was traveling so smoothly through the air with no sound.  It was soooo unusual.  I am unable to express how different it was than anything I have EVER seen.  It was going maybe much faster than a jet plane could, but it was almost like a &#34;glider.&#34;   Tried to take photos of if, but I was driving alone, and they didn&#39;t come out too well on my camera phone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I tried to call FAA to find out about it..but couldn&#39;t get anyone to answer me.  It was stopping traffic...it was just like NOTHING I have ever seen in the world.  It was amazing and very, very big.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I would love to know if anyone else reported something yesterday morning.  It was approx around 10:45am ET.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thank you.<n>

It is a clear blue sky day and the highway is next to the Atlantic Ocean.  The ocean was calm and less than 12in waves crashing the shore.  Out to sea, I could see three large freighters anchored off of Port Everglades, approx three miles off shore. Some small recreational boats numbering less than 5 were crossing the horizon heading north and south and out to sea to weed line for fishing. Out to the NE I would guess approxmently 7 to 10 miles I could see two very large standing tall white cylinders and two to three white cubes next to the cylinders.  It looked like tall buildings out in the ocean; I would say that they were 8 to 12 stories high and 4 stories wide. The 2 to 3 cubes were ½ the size.  There are no oil rigs off of Broward County; this was not a ship, a cruise ship, boat, and water spout or condominium refection from the shore line.  I don’t know what it was, but it was out there, on the ocean like a city on the sea.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It seemed to have been in close proximity above my house (based on the sound).  The sound which woke me from sleep was VERY loud and VERY deep...it was nearly deafening!  Once I had been woken, it lasted for probably 8 to 10 seconds.  I can&#39;t say how long it had been there since I had previously been asleep.  But then, it departed FAST!  It was so fast that within a second, all noise was completely gone!  The sound changed and you could tell it became very distant VERY fast (and sounded almost as if it had sucked the atmosphere as it departed, if that makes sense).<n> <n><n> <n><n> Whatever it was, was way faster than any plane I had ever heard!  I was afraid to go outside at first (this thing was seriously loud, it had shaken me up!), but after a few minutes (after having heard it depart at such an astronomical speed) I went out to look in the sky and saw nothing and no trace.  There was a full cover of very white clouds in the sky though (which was weird being it was at night, and that they were so bright) but none of them seemed to be disturbed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There is supposed to be a military facility that deals in top secret aircraft outside of Rockwall Texas (away from Mesquite).  My guess is, it was probably a very VERY fast military craft (faster than ANYTHING made public).  I guess that the sightings in Stephensville, TX may also be accounted for by whatever inventions are going on outside of Rockwall.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I just thought I&#39;d share this.  Would be curious to find out if anyone actually saw it.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

No calls were made to the police relating to this crash, so no other eyewitness reports could be found. The object did not appear to be a plane crash, it looked more like a strange falling object or a shooting star that had come WAY too close to earth, and possibly burned up while falling. I personally still beleive this could have been an Unidentified Flying Object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.  PD))<n>

It proceeded at a very alarming speed to the horizon, paused for not but a second and changed direction heading NW I believe. It was very agile in that its speed and turn were impeccable. The object appeared to move over miles easily, I&#39;ve not seen any &#34;shooting stars&#34; or meteors in my time to stay on an even level as if it were in flight. The Light was very quiet and the event couldn&#39;t have lasted for more than 6-8 secs.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have heard rumors of a satellite that should be coming down and also of various fragments entering our atmosphere.

I went in to get the vid cams, and started filming, The first light.  the brightest was like a plasma ball. With an electric storm inside of it. The one to the east, same elivation. Was like a blue diamond, then a blur, then a jet shape, and was morphing all over the place. The other one was west, and was a little bit higher, this was about, 65 degrees high. And was multi coloured, red green bright blue and intence white. And was morphing.  I have a good few hours of dvd video and 8mm footage of this event.

At first it was coming towards us, flying really low &amp; slow, and then it kinds turned to our left, its right. We followed and turned to the right with it along the rode, now it was on my left side, the driver side. It kinda went in that direction for a little bit, still really slow. Then it slowly crossed over us and then was on the right side. It was flying so low, it looked unbelievable. I felt as though i could just reach out the window and touch it. A little bit later it slowly got higher and higher and then it was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I saw the object for about 5 seconds before it was nearly going over my home but it was slightly to the north of me. This thing went by at an unearthly speed, did not change directions and was completely silent. I watched the object streak away from me heading southwest. I estimate the object traveled horizon to horizon in 10-15 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The atmosphere was very clear at the time of my sighting but there were a few scattered low clouds. The object seemed to be flying just above the low clouds and was flying parallel to the ground.  It was extremely hard to make out the shape due to the brightness and speed but it appeared to be a classic saucer shaped UFO. There was an amazing bright white glow around the object as it passed by and it was stunningly beautiful. I did have a camera phone in my pocket but obviously had no time to attempt a picture.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It’s been about two hours since my UFO sighting and my heart is still racing with excitement. What was most shocking to me was how low this UFO was flying for such a remarkable speed and that it was silent! There must be others who witnessed what I saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

My fiancée was already seated in my car.  As I rounded the car to the driver’s side, I opened the door and proceeded to get inside.  Before I had entered the car, I glanced upwards (in the fluid motion of getting into the car, my head looked upwards) and saw the object.  There was low cloud cover, and the clouds were slightly lit from either the moon or the sunset, although not brightly.  Between the sporadic cloud cover, I witnessed an extremely fast bluish-white light traveling from my left to right.  The object appeared to be relatively low to the ground, but above the cloud cover.  There was absolutely no noise.  The first time I saw the object, it lasted for about 2 seconds.  Since I could see the trajectory of the object during that time, my eye continued along the sky to where it would have been if it were not obscured by the cloud covering.  A few seconds later, I witnessed it again between the clouds in the same color and speed as previously seen.  Since I am familiar with fighter jets in this area of San Diego, I am familiar with the relative speed at which they appear to be traveling to the ground observer.  This was significantly faster, and without the usual accompanying sound that jets make.  Additionally, it appeared that the object was completely glowing, or possibly I could only see the flame produced by the object.  It may be important to note that I have better than 20/10 vision, somewhere approaching 20/5 vision.  In the short time I saw the object, I could not see anything traveling in front of the object, such as a rocket, although this could be possible.  Also, the “flame” appeared the have a gradient of color from white at the top to blue at the bottom, not from end to end as might be expected from a jet or rocket flame.  Also, in comparison to the diameter of the flame, this would be an unusually long flame, as it appeared to have a length approximately 10 times i! ts heigh t.  Also, although observed very briefly, the ends of the object appeared to not be pointed, but rather slanted toward the top of the object.  There didn’t appear to be any trail left by the object, although it was so bright that visually it left a slight optical trail.  This was far brighter than what you would expect even a full moon would reflect off a reflective object.  The moon, however, at that time, was below the horizon and not visible.  Sunset had been approximately 45 minutes earlier.  I will e-mail a diagram showing my best estimate at the distances and my position at the time of the sighting.  The red arrow on the diagram shows my position and direction of viewing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It may also be helpful to know that I have never reported a UFO, nor do I claim to ever have seen anything unexplainable before.  Honestly, this seemed to possibly be something manmade, perhaps the Aurora which I have heard about.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Were not sure about the exact location, but it was somewhere between Kettleman City and Buttonwillow. The sky was pitch black and stars were visible. My wife and I both saw a glowing fireball of light in the sky moving from east to west. The fireball was very bright with a blue tinge. It appeared to be low in the sky moving in a perfectly horizontal streak. The instant we saw it we thought it might be a shooting star, but then it continued to last for about 15-20 seconds. The light did not dim or arc as a shooting star typically does. It continued horizontally and then split into two bright lights. Next, the two lights immediately moved in opposite directions and disappeared. We were shocked because it looked nothing like a shooting star and it was definitely not an airplane.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Additionally, a pilot who landed approximately 10-15 minutes after the call reported seeing nothing abnormal while flying to the airport.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

While sitting in the left turn lane I had the feeling of being watched (my hair on the back of my neck was standing up) so I paused at the intersection and looked upward into the sky. There it was off to my left, a solid white, extremely bright circle with a slightly smaller bright circle of light off to the right connected by a line of bright whiteness again.  It looked like a dumbbell sort of. I looked down at the road to refocus my eyes and rubbed them for 3-5 seconds and looked up again and it was still there.  I have never ever seen anything like this.  No one else was around or on the roadway.  I am not sure if this was one ship or two connected together.  I was terrified and drove off making my U-turn and heading down to Dunkin Donuts.  I did not observe any other aircraft in the area and the object(s) blacked out the background.  They were just slightly smaller than the size of a water bottle cap held at arms length.  To my eye they were about the size of my thumb at arms length.  I would estimate the altitude of the object(s) to be anywhere from 1000 ft. to 10,000 ft. It was difficult to tell.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am very level headed and am a Civil Engineer with amateur Astronimical Experience and have never seen anything like this.  Each object had to be at least as big as an individual airplane.  I did not see the object(s) move at all.<n>

We had just finished setting up the Barbeque for a late dinner. We were in a suburb called Harris Park, Sydney. The night was beautiful with not a cloud in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I was cooking some sausages on the barbeque I noticed a very small but slow moving object directly above us. It was moving in the East direction. It appeared just as a light. I thought at the time that it would be a satelite as aeroplanes have both red and white lights blinking while flying. As it dissapeared in the East direction. I noticed another object moving at the same speed heading in the North direction. This object was moving at the slow same speed but was brighter. I told my friend to look up and check it out. As we were watching it, the object sped up and dissappeared. My friend didn&#39;t know what it was and neither did I at that moment. As we were speaking about the idea that it could be a spaceship or UFO, my friend just had is eyes pealed to the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I was finished with the cooking, my friend noticed something brighter directly above the house. It was very bright of white light, like lightening light during a storm. As the object seemed to get lower and lower above his house we noticed that the light that was coming from this UFO was reflecting its light off the street and houses. The UFO made no sound, unlike helicopters or aeroplanes do. My friend grabbed his video comera and filmed as much as he could. I was amazed too. It would of been about 3-4hundred metres away and shining brightly over us. I thought it was an angel of light but my friend was convinced that it was a UFO. It moved very slowly and headed in a Northerly direction. It was brighter than a night of a full moon on a clear night. We watched the object move north slowly and watched it dissappear over the horizon. Since then my friend always carries his video camera at night and believes that we were visited by UFO&#39;s. I told him that even though they may seem like they come from another planet that they could come from Earth. To this very day, my friend and eye meet up regulary and watch the footage he filmed over a case of beer, wondering if something like that would ever happen again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness provides no contact information.

The light appeared unusual as it bounced up and down slightly a few times then stayed stationary.  The light proceeded to move up and down and then sideways.  I ran inside to get my camera and came back out to get some photos and the light continued to hover in the sky.  There was no sound associated with the light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I took several shots with my camera changing the settings and going in and out with the wide angle the red light proceeded to move towards the north getting higher and moving farther away.

It was stationary so we thought it WAS a  police helicopter. Then it dawned on us that our police dept most likely doesn’t  own that many helicopters! They had flashing lights but were not flashing lights on the ground like police helicopters do when they are looking for someone etc. They just hovered ther and were very bright.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As we merged onto I85 we saw 2 then 3, then 4 more similar objects/lights in the distance all what appeared to be exactly the same distance away from one another. We live in the city, at the end of a street  near a hospital ,with helicopters landing and taking off many times of the day and night, so we know what they look and sound like day and night.  We are also very familiar with the airports traffic patterns and what several airplanes coming in towards the airport on the horizon look like.  This was not like that. These objects hovered like helicopters had flashing lights of red gold and white all at the same altitude over the distance of about 10 miles altogether.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As we drove down the road, (about 8-10 miles or so, we saw all of the lights remain where they were, but began to notice in between them were VERY small objects (tiny red lights) that travelled at very high speeds  between the brighter larger main objects. We stopped the car and witnessed several of these small objects travelling very fast in different directions.   Our son became worried because we were shocked and very interested to the point that we stopped the car, so we continued on to the grocery store and went inside.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was dark.  I heard a deep rumnbling that seemed to come out of the sky.  This may seem weird, but after hearing this deep bass sound out of the sky(maybe),There3 were lights in the sky.They were&#39;nt anything I&#39;ve ever seen. I&#39;ve heard sonic booms.  It wasn&#39;t that. Actually ,right nnow I&#39;m baffled.  It was like there were lightd that manifested themselves in just a fraction of a second. It was nothing of this reality.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
1/26/08 18:41|Low Moor|VA|Unknown|5 - 7 seconds|Low, large, fast, maneuvering aircraft with strange glow and configuration over I-64W.|3/19/09|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/068/S68279.html|75|ndxe200801| Low, large, fast, maneuvering aircraft with strange glow and configuration over I-64W.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Was driving from Clifton Forge to Covington, Va. on I-64 W after getting off work and going to the grocery store.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Weather was overcast, just before a winter storm warning, with low, solid clouds, cold temperatures, and poor visibility. Sky was fully darkened.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Was driving due west on I-64 when I observed from the far left, an aircraft of some kind, which flew from left to right (very south to very north) over the interstate. The aircraft was approximately the same size as a typical fighter aircraft, but didn&#39;t have running lights. First off, there were no flashing lights at all (required by FAA), and also no solid wingtip lights, if there were any wings. Second, the aircraft had a distinctly large, bright, diffuse aft glow, orange to peach in color, oval in shape like a figure &#34;8&#34; laid on its side but not that precise. This gave the impression of what might be jet engines, but it didn&#39;t seem as bright or cherry-red as engines, and was more large and amorphous, less like two distinct circles, like you&#39;d observe on a fighter aircraft at night. Also, there was a fore end glow, rather large but smaller than the aft end glow, also peach or orange in color but less bright, and either pointed-oval or cone-shaped, like a cockpit with the light on. It gave the impression of a structured craft with a general shape of a high aspect ratio cone, but the glowing features were not bright enough to illuminate wings or a fuselage of any kind.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The aircraft flew approximately over Alleghany Regional Hospital, perpendicular to the interstate, over the interstate, until it reached Valley Ridge Road in front of Alleghany High School, where it took a sharp turn westward, to follow Valey Ridge Road. It cut the turn rather abruptly, kind of &#34;skidding&#34; through the air and wobbling from left to right a couple of times to overcorrect its path to a straight line before proceeding due west to the right of I-64 along Valley Ridge Road toward Covington, where I lost it. When it cut the right-angle turn, the glow seemed to brighten, but that could have just been me getting a straight-on look at it&#39;s aft section.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What struck me was how low, large, fast and maneuverable it was. There is a mountain behind the high school, can&#39;t be more than 1,500 feet high. I saw this thing silhouetted against that mountain as it flew off, so it was definitely lower than the ridge. It looked like it had to hand a fast left to avoid smacking into the ridge. Approximately the size of a large jet fighter only larger, and very fast and maneuverable... I&#39;d say the whole sighting lasted maybe 5-7 seconds. There had to be lots of people who saw this, it was over the interstate at a very busy time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This could be related to some daylight sightings of Osprey aircraft operating in Lexington a few weeks ago. Could this have been an Osprey at night? I don&#39;t know. Somehow I don&#39;t think so, because if you saw this thing move, it moved more like a cruise missile or sophisticated UAV or something. Also, there was NO (and I mean absoluted ZERO) sound at all coming from this thing. That produced an eerie effect. After I lost it, I looked at my car radio and marked the time as 6:41 PM.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Anyone else who saw this, I&#39;d appreciate your views. Thanks.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.  PD))<n>

The rest of the pieces almost seemed to disappear before going below the telephone lines and houses across the street and out of view.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My son spotted this on 1-28-08 in the evening sky almost dark at 6:00 to 6:15 PM.  He ran inside telling me to look at these huge strange lights in the sky so I slipped my shoes on and immediately went out to see it and called my wife out to see it and we were all stunned.  The event lasted for approximately 4 or 5 minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We immediately turned on the news and flipped through the local channels looking for something but nothing on the news.  We turned on the news radio expecting to hear something but there was nothing.  I called 911 and reported it to the local police who said they had 1 call preceding mine and that 2 of their officers were on the radio reporting having seen the same thing.  We wanted to make sure it was not the Shuttle but looked up on line and it appears the shuttle is still on earth.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We searched all local and other news on the web and found nothing.  Continued to watch our news and nothing but reports of the dead spy satellite that was due to crash into earth in the next month.  That story broke exactly 2 hours before we saw this.  The next day nothing in the news or the papers nothing on the web.  This seems odd to me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am guessing it was a satellite breaking up and maybe these were large solar panels but they must have been huge.  I am not sure if anyone reading this can estimate size and distance but they appeared to be about an inch or so long in a photograph when entering the atmosphere above telephone lines across the street from my house so looking up about 50 feet in the south west sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I estimate they must have been much larger than a jumbo jet.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They were so large all I could think of was the international space station having some problem.  Please if there is any news about this please let me know.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thank you.<n>

Thinking that they were meteorites, I continued walking, until I noticed that they both were not flying in a set path, but were instead moving rather rapidly, I continued watching, occasionally the light would die down to a small, almost pinpoint light that flashed about every second, but eventually the fire would flare back up and the objects would continue to fly, one even discharged what I thought was a ember that quickly died out and vanished.<n> <n><n> <n><n> While I was alone on the ground, I noticed an airplane with two headlights and a large wingspan flying above me, observing the UFOs, they eventually went over the horizon, and while I lost my visualization, the plane did not, and continued to follow them for as long as I was in the area and even after I left, I would assume after leaving Fullerton, the objects flew over Brea, and eventually the City of Industry, but that is left up to speculation based on their flight path at the time of the sighting.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The orange color seemed to be some sort of energy, as it would trail behind them slightly as they moved around.  The two objects would hover for short periods and then slowly rotate as they moved a different direction (you could tell they were rotating because of the trail of material).  Each oval turned off and then back on at least three times during the time period we were driving down the street and watching them at the stoplights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> One of them appeared to start moving down, then disappeared, then appeared high above the other one.  I&#39;m so glad there were three of us to see them - no idea what they were.  During the period, there were two aircraft in the vicinity.  One of them began to circle the area and continued to do so after they disappeared.  They appeared to be commercial airplanes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Note that it was very dark outside even though it was early.  There has been terrible rain and the skies have been nearly black with rainclouds.   Also note that there were many other witnesses who saw these objects as we were driving.

As she was driving in Yorba Linda, CA @ approximately 6pm 1-26-08, she saw a bright ball of fire coming down SW of Yorba Linda. It looked like something entering out atmosphere, very hot. It had a &#34;tail&#34; of flame trailing it. As she was watching it, another &#34;object&#34; appeared directly behind it, looking identical to the first. While watching them, she said they both suddenly disappeared, then within seconds reappeared, disappeared again, and then reappeared. She also noticed a plane flying nearby the falling objects, possibly observing them. Once the objects were out of site, or had possibly crashed, the plane started circling above where she believes the objects crashed. If you have any insight to these &#34;UFO&#39;s&#34; (Unidentified falling objects), we would love to know more. Thank you.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((names deleted)<n>

In the sky ahead was a bright, glowing light falling toward earth with a bright tail of light/fire. First we thought that it was a falling star, but both of us realized quickly it was far too large and too close to the earth for that.  We said to each other, &#34;its going to crash into the earth&#34;. Then it stopped falling and hovered.  The tail of light extinguished and the main ball of light remained very bright. It faded in and out and then traveled horizontally very quickly. It would dissappear and then suddenly reapper a few miles to the side.  And then dissappear and reappear back in the original place.  Another glowing light seemed to be circling around it in a wide pattern.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Both very bright lights, brighter than airplane headlights. Farther away from these two was another light.  It was blue and very small. It seemed to be circling these in a very wide pattern and we thought it to be airplane watching the phenomenon. But, soon afterward thought it too was related to the UFO.  We didn&#39;t pull over and kept driving toward them, but, they got lower to the horizon and we lost sight of them behind trees as the road we were on dipped. When we got back to an unobstructed spot, the lights were gone. The event lasted about 5-10 minutes. Despite the highly visible, quite spectacular display in the night sky, not one report of it could be found on news stations or in the OC Register. We ourselves called into FOX and left a voice mail about the sighting.  No one ever called us back.  In discussing it&#39;s location, we estimate that it was approximately 50 miles away whichi would make it over LA County even though we were seeing it from Orange County. There was! a storm coming in that night and the glowing orbs seemed to be near the edge of the cloud bank that could be seen far off toward western horizon toward downtown L.A.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We originally logged this on another UFO reporting website, HBCC Run by Brian Vike, on 1/26/08.  We saw that many others also logged this same sighting on that website as well.  Background on us:  I am a licensed psychologist and have my own practice and my husband is a vice president in a computer voice over IP company.  We are both in our mid forties.  Our 5 year old son was in the back seat of our truck with us at the time.  I don&#39;t know if this sighting changed anyone else&#39;s lives that witnessed it, but it sure changed mine for the better.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

This surprised me.  I watched as it approached to see if it might be a helicopter.  As it approached, I could see that it was taking on a disk shape with  a bubble on top.  I do not know what distance I was from it as I had no  reference point for size other than trees.  There were no clouds near it although it was a partially  cloudy day.  I started to go in and get my wife but as I was watching it vanished.  Just winked out.

One of his sightings he captured on video, and we consider it to be a very interesting case.  PD))<n> <n><n> <n><n> Distant white spheres seen by crowd on college campus<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was attending the Stan Romanek presentation at St Cajetan&#39;s Church on the Auraria Campus near downtown Denver. Shortly after 4:00 PM (4:15?) a break was called (the program ran from 2PM to 6PM). Many people, including me, went outside. It was a very nice day, mild (in the 40&#39;s), partly sunny, very light breeze. I just looked at the sky casually, but then I noticed a lot of people were looking and pointing and yelling about something in the sky. They were all looking north or northwest. I asked someone to point them out to me; it took me about 30 seconds to notice them for myself. They appeared to be white. Most people said they looked like spheres (in fact, some said they were PERFECT spheres) but to me they looked more flattened, like a disc would look; however, I wear glasses and my prescription is 4 years old and I know I don&#39;t have 20/20 vision with them anymore. A few people had cameras or cell phones with cameras and were trying to take pictures. I saw that one person has already posted their report and included 3 photos. They do look more rounded in the photos, so it was probably my eyesight that made them look more flattened somehow. A couple of people thought they were balloons, but I did not think so for 2 reasons. First, they did not drift together in the same direction like balloons would be if carried by the wind. They would change direction, go into and out of clouds, and move in opposite directions to one another and stop and hover, then move again. There were 3 or 4 initially, then only 2, then only 1. Then I went back inside because the program was to resume. Either the other objects took off so fast I couldn&#39;t see them, or they disappeared, or went behind a cloud or two. Stan was outside for a few minutes and also saw them but said it was hard to tell whether &#34;they&#34; were there for him and the crowd, or whether it was balloons or whatever; he didn&#39;t watch them for long and went back inside. He asked the crowd later how many people saw the objects and a lot of hands wen! t up, pr obably more people saw them than didn&#39;t. Last summer at the UFO Watchtower, where Stan also was, there was a similar looking sighting--bright white color, very distant and high in the sky.<n>

It was covered and wrapped in a teal green tarp very tightly. The object was a disk like shape with two symetrical fins coming off the front or back. The general size was roughly a little larger than a private prop plane. There were two cars infront of the truck and two behind all with different plates. All the vehicles had tinted windows and were white in color. From what my wife and I could see all the occupants of the vehicles were clean cut white males in what appeared to be white button down shirts. They made efforts to stay closley grouped as not to have any other cars come within the formation. The shape of the craft had a similar shape to that of the ships depictded in &#34;Independence Day&#34;. The whole situation was rather odd when we began to think of everything as a whole. What better way to hide something than in plain sight. The object was secured on a steel tube frame and was like I stated earlier very tight. No surface area was exposed and and the object hung over roughly 3-4 feet on each side of the bed. It was positioned at an angle on the truck because of its size. Traffic was rather heavy that day and I am sure others had the same thoughts because several people ahead of me on the road slowed down to take a second look.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous;  provides no contact information.

Last night while on my porch just after midnight I noticed an object that was more spherical than a plane would appear and significantly larger -- I would estimate about 5 to 6 times greater in size than an airplane would be at that distance.  I watched it for about five minutes and it did not move, nor did it become larger or smaller as a plane would have had it been moving.  It was spherical, gradually changed from white to yellow (much unlike the flashing of airplane lights) and emitted and aura and lights in hues of red, yellow-orange, white and occasionally blue around its periphery.  It appeared to emit an occasional small beam of white light, though not in any discernible pattern or consistent direction.  The best way to explain the emitting colors would be to compare it to a child&#39;s sparkler on the fourth of July.  This craft/light was silent, which again is quite unlike any airplane I am accustomed to seeing, particularly on nights as quiet and still as last night was.  After approximately five minutes, possibly a bit less, the light simply went out and I was unable to see it.  There was nothing obstructing my view of it so it is impossible that its view was obscured by a tree or structure.  The sky was clear and nearly cloudless (I could see many stars) so it&#39;s not possible that it went behind a cloud, either.  I came out several more times over the next two hours, camera in hand, but it did not reappear.  Unfortunately my husband was already sleeping so did not witness it with me.  I am quite curious to see if anyone else has reported seeing similar stationary lights in Portland recently.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I called it in to the local police because i thought something crashed, i never heard a thing, and i honestly thought we were being bombed or something.

A dime sized white light appeared in the sky. I thought it was a star but then it grew in size and changed its shape it resembled a salad plate in its new size and shape. It made the gauge cluster in the car I was driving go dim. This encounter lasted for about 30 seconds before the object sped off  high into the sky in a easterly direction into the clouds of the night sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Jan. 25th,2008 I saw a bright red star west of Albuquerque, NM. IT seemed very high. I stopped to look at it and noticed it was moving south, but not as fast as a jet would travel.

After about 20 minutes, I noticed it had not really moved, but now seemed to be flashing in someway, so I figured it was just a helicopter hovering, then again I wondered why it was there for so long. One thing I know for sure, it was not a star, and I’ve been gazing at the stars since I was a kid using my telescope. Upon arriving home I saw nothing more of it, but here is where it gets interesting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My 12 year old daughter was coming back from a birthday event in Newton (at aprox 10pm), she and 3 other kids, along with the mother saw a &#34;very bright&#34; light and it seemed to be near them, perhaps following them (of course this was according to the kids being that the mom was driving and could not tell for sure).  Ok, so my 12 year old daughter pulled out her 7.1mp camera and took several photos of this object. The first one is &#34;very interesting&#34; (you be the judge), but the next few photos were not so great, (i.e. look like a photo of a star perhaps).<n> <n><n> <n><n> I wanted to send both photos your way just in case you felt it was news worthy.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Again, I did not see the object as clearly as my daughter did, but her photo seems to look alot like a &#34;UFO&#34;, well at least from there perspective, it was an Unidentified Flying Object, right?  Please review the photos and let me know what you think?  Thanks.<n>

I was traveling in the county on Whitesbridge rd. When just so I desided to take a glance at a field on my left. When I looked I noticed a huge bright ball shaped white-blueish colored light above some trees it was like nothing I ever saw. It lite up the whole sky. I stopped to get a closer look and when I did I noticed right above the light was an large dish shaped object.I could not tell the color of the disk just the outline of it. It had to be about an acre long. On the dish there was many different lights all shaped like circles and flashing. The color of those lights were red,blue, and green. The ship just seem to sit there.Then all of a sudden all I saw was a bright flash of light zoom across the field before and their was a loud humming noise as it left. This is not the first time this has been seen. I have encouraged other people to report their sighting.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was approximately 4:40 p.m. and the weather was overcast with some sunbreaks but mostly low, billowy gray and white clouds and a light gray cover that completely obscured the Cascades and Mt. Rainier from my view.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As the traffic began to move, I saw a yellowish orb (shaped like a tic-tac from my vantage point.) exit a gray cloudbank to the north, and move at a constant velocity and altitude above what I presume were, the foothills of the Snoqualmie forest in the Enumclaw vicinity.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Within seconds of seeing the object, I made a quick glance to my right to make my turn onto Pacific Ave heading south. I looked to the east and fortunately I was able see it again, between the telephone poles, in about its last 1/3 of visible travel before it entered a white cloud bank to the south.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had no time what so ever to try to grab my cell phone camera and miss the opportunity to witness and/or try to identify what I was seeing. I estimate the distance from my vantage point to the object at approximately 15 to 20 miles, (using Google Earth).  At that distance, I could not make out any surface features, hear any sound, or observe any contrails or changes in its color, shape, or trajectory.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When the object disappeared into the white cloudbank, I immediately looked at the clock in my truck, which is accurate to a minute or so.  It was 4:40 p.m.   I started to write down this info as I drove south down Pacific Ave.<n> <n><n> <n><n> From my vantage point with the hills visible behind it, the objects trajectory and size reminded me of one of many film clips I have seen countless times on television, of jet aircraft flying nearly nap of the earth, dropping ordinance with the desert hills in the background.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In contrast, less than 5 minutes down the road at the intersection of 72nd and Pacific, I looked up and saw a 727 looking jet liner very high in the sky, but obviously low enough to clearly recognize as an commercial aircraft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I grew up in Lakewood WA, very close to McChord AFB.  I have observed many aircraft fly at varying altitudes around Tacoma for over 30 years.   I soloed a crusty Cessna C-150 at Shelton Airport in the summer of 1986.   I became proficient at recoqizing aircraft, especially F-16s, F-15s and F-18s by their vertical stabilizer orientation at very long distances.  I feel I would have recognized the profile of the object as a fighter jet or a light plane at that distance except that it travel much to fast to be a light plane.  Also, even though there may have been a break in the clouds, a glint from an aircraft windscreen does not look like a yellow orb.  Fighter Jets don’t fly along the Snoqualmie Forest.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My conclusions are that it was either:  1) Ball Lighting 2) Super secret Boeing aircraft developed over the decades from captured Nazi plans and prototypes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 3) An example of the yellowish appearing, cigar / orb shape UFO seen and filmed throughout recent history.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Midway through the flight, in clear daylight, I saw a cigar shaped craft, or missle, silver colored with fins in the back, going at an incredible rate of speed about 100 yards under our plane.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was going from north to south.  It had a slight shake which I attributed to the fantastic rate of speed it was going at.  There is no way for me to accurately say what the speed was, but it was gone in a matter of seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I wasn&#39;t drinking and it was very clear out.

Using the binoculars it was clearer and we could see there were 3 in a triangle shape. Observing the closest one noted that within the circle were electric currents which also changed colours.  A very strange event,  I have never seen anything like it in my life.  After a while noticed a 4th one in the distance.  They all moved but the one we had been observing was getting smaller as if going away at a angle into the distance. Just incredible.

At exactly 11:00 P.M., I was driving home on Cheyenne street,(1 street away from my house) when I witnessed a flying disklike object hovering over the trees.  I stared in awe at the object because of its two very large, bright yellow lights symmetrically apart from each other, but definitely attached to the disklike object. I began to slow my truck down and pull onto the side of the road because it looked as if it were very close, almost as if it was going to land in the forest. I was in a rush to get home and seeing this object made me pull over because of it&#39;s size, lighting, and location it was hovering. It remained hovering for 2-3 minutes and suddenly vanished.

This was before the sighting I am reporting myself.<n> <n><n> <n><n> He described the shape to be triangular but smoothed around the edges like a guitar pick and having 5 or 6 blue lights. It made no noise at all and just hovered about his vehicle then disappeared. Around 21:15, I spotted a figure in the sky, three lights in a row, a diagonal line. The line faded in and out twice and then completely disappeared. Ten minutes later, the object came around again but this time actually had more shape to it, its aura cigar like in shape. It first appeared as a small red dot-like shape in the sky then got increasingly bigger. It glowed red and looked as if it was spinning. I could kind of make out the shape of the central point, which was like an oval ring or halo. I started freaking out and telling someone about it and as soon as I started to it kind of just faded away, shifting into the sky to the left of me. Another in the same area, its position to the south, spotted this object, which is the general direction of the town of Bel Air where my associate spotted the object directly above him. The colors described were different so I decided to count them as two different sightings.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I would rather submit little personal info as possible though I have included my email for further contact.<n>

I told the people with me but they hadn&#39;t seen it. The obhect was neon-green ringed and had a slowly spiraling pattern on it.  It was an incredible 14 feet away from me, I was startled, as it caught my gaze it moved incredibly slowly over me, something bugged my eye so I rubbed it, looked back up and it was no where to be seen.  I felt somehow trapped staring at this disk-like object...I had never seen anything as eerie as that before.  I looked around before consulting my friends to see if anyone else was startled, only a few amount of people were talking and gesturing toward the sky where I had seen it.  As it caught my gaze, I felt as if nothing else was going on around me...all noise was drowned out.  This is no fake report, I don&#39;t waste my time with things like that, what I saw baffles me even now.  I hope that you can give me some sort of logical explanation...the craft made no sound, no quick movements, no anything!<n>
1/24/08 21:00|Fredericksburg|VA|Unknown|constant|bright object high in the sky, rotates and hovers constantly. almost like an insect.|2/14/08|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/061/S61184.html|106|ndxe200801| bright object high in the sky, rotates and hovers constantly. almost like an insect.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;ve seen this object or craft many times throughout the years in 3 different locations where I&#39;ve lived in Fredericksburg. Object appears high in the sky, appearing higher than most planes fly and definitely higher than any helicopter. (and moving FAR differently than those crafts.)  At a glance it appears to be just another star but if you set your eyes on it, you begin to notice movements not unlike that of an insect of some sort. It will start in one spot, hover around in circular motions and end up back in its original spot.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Although I&#39;ve seen this object many times, tonight is the first night that I&#39;ve noticed the lights. I always thought it was just putting off one beam that stayed in place but tonight I can see that the lights seem to be rotating around the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Very bright like the light from a large star but definitely not a star. I dont know anything about weather balloons or satelites but I dont think they operate like this. I just want to know if anyone else in the area has seen this.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The last thing I&#39;d like to say is... a few years ago, I was living with my parents and saw this object (or one like it)early in the morning, about 2am. My dog began barking loudly and fiercely soon after I spotted it. Not barking at the object but something off in the woods almost directly under where the object was located. Needless to say, I was alarmed quite a bit. Soon after, he got worse.. howling and I looked in the direction he was barking and saw, from what I could tell, was a man running in some sort of metal armor but was so quick that he was gone within seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About 3 days later, I got home and my dog had broken his chain and was gone from sight and didnt return. The next day, I went riding around to look to see if he had been hit by a car on the main road. Sure enough, it appeared he had been hit. The strange thing though is that, any time previously when he had gotten loose, he NEVER strayed nearly as far as where I found him. Maybe I&#39;m just paranoid but my instinct told me that the night with the object and the barking had something to do with it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So maybe i&#39;m just paranoid but I&#39;d love to hear from some other Virginia people about this. Thank you.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I was in the passenger seat. We stopped at a stop sign facing the southeast sky. I saw a huge bright light “fall” in an arc path from left to right very quickly like a streak.  I thought it was a falling star, so I drove in the direction of where I thought it fell. As I drove toward the area, I reached a clearing in the sky so a good part of the sky was not occluded with trees etc. This was about 2 or 3 minutes after seeing the light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I looked up, there was definitely a circle of lights. My mind was thinking “falling star” so I thought they were helicopters that were around where it fell, but as I watched them, they were all in a perfect circle, all completely still and there were at least 6 or 7 lights.   The circle was covering a huge area in the sky.  We continued to drive in the same direction, but we weren’t getting any closer to the area or the circle of lights, so we went home.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I called the local news station to see if anyone else had reported something, or if an aircraft had gone down.  The person who answered the phone said I was the second person to call, but then I never heard anything else about it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is the first time I have ever seen anything like this.<n>

As I got to the far side of the bridge and could note the traffic light, I noted that it was green.  Then I immediately noted another green light/ flash of light beyond and above the traffic light in the far distance.  This light appeared to burn green and streaked downward toward the horizon in a fast streak, changing to yellow as it fell.  This was much more vivid in color than any other meteor/shooting star that I have ever seen, but it did follow the same trajectory.  It was just much lower to the ground than anything that I have ever witnessed, and it was bright enough to be seen against other bright lights from the businesses at the interstate exchange including a convenience store, a closed heavy equipment company with many outside lights and one smaller convenience store as well as headlights from oncoming cars (I think two were coming at the time).  The whole incident could not have lasted more than 1 to 1 ½ seconds, but it was vivid enough that I fully expected to hear a boom.  Upon contemplating, however, it was probably very far away.  It was abnormal enough that after getting the kids in the bed, I tried to find out if there were any expected meteor showers or if there was a known plane crash or satellite failure.  I could find no evidence of anything like this on the web or new sites.  I have never reported anything like this before, but I have also never seen anything quite like this before either.  I mainly wanted to post this in case there were any other similar reports.  A reply would be nice if anyone has seen anything similar in the central Georgia sky at about the same time.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

After about 2 seconds a third light appeared next to the other two but was double the distance from the first two lights and lasted for about 2 or 3 seconds and then all the lights went out simultaneously.

Then I heard the next day from a fellow employee that she heard on a 104.4 I believe? FM Talk Show radio...Out of Fla.,... that people saw lights and shapes with lights in the sky in Altamonte Springs, Fla. and Orlando? Heard again from a co-worker...please contact us if need be or our Son for further questions or possible video to help in a possible investigation in what might have been seen with maybe alot of indiviuals that are not crazy, or nutts, or wanting any kind of publicity..

It was in the East,later found to be moving West.From this distance we observed a small red flashing light on top.But the front was very brightly lighted with white lights.Our sighting begin about six city blocks away. By the time we were less then a block away we could tell the direction it was heading. It stood out to me because it was heading East to West in a flight corridore that flies jet planes North to South every hour into OHare and Midway at approx. 20 to 40 planes an hour.It appeared to my untrained eye to be maybe a mile in the sky.As it begin to fly over us as we stopped at a stop sign we observed two more same sized bright white lights come on making four lights straight across.The lights were so bright no shape of the ship could be observed. I looked straight up at it only to see the four bright lights.We proceeded to make a left turn at which time we stopped and saw nothing except a distant object going West miles in altitude and several miles away. If this was indeed the same vehicle it had increased altitude greatly and air speed in a very short time. Local papers carried nothing I could find regarding the story.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The light was clear/white. We were on 173rd st.going east.As we came to a stop sign one block from home it was floating above us heading southwest.Two round overpowering clear lights were on. As it moved closer two more lights same size came on. Now there were 4 in a row.They didnot shine down. They just kept us from making out the shape of the craft.It moved west right over us.Then in seconds took off north then southwest out of sight.Big to very high and small in seconds.It did not even seem to turn but just reversed direction. One small red light on top.No sound.Probably 5 miles in altitude and ten miles down range in seconds.The lights made it impossible to tell the shape of the vehicle.The two additional lights came on seperately like switches were thrown.This normally crosses the commercial flight path to midway and Ohare air ports in Chicago. No planes were present during this sighting.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was approxitimately 700-800 feet high.  No more than a hundred feet above treetop level.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I continued north at 65 mph  a oval vehicle came out of the left side of the cloud.  It had no wings or visible engines. It was silent.  We were now at Katonah and the craft lowered about 50 - 100 feet. It stabilized and continued moving north with me in a fixed position. It was ovular.  It had a cross figure in the front. This was brownish in three quarters.  The upper left corner had a white center and a solitary figure in the middle.  It followed me in a fixed position up to the point of Golden&#39;s bridge. It was roughly 1800-1830.  The craft then backed up without turning and floated up to the left side of the cloud.  It seemed to jostle as it was resetting back into it&#39;s position.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The cloud then looked more like a square hour glass.  It banked toward a north easterly direction.

The light quickly disappeared, and then came back shining even brighter with two, albeit much dimmer lights above it,  altogether forming a triangle of three white lights. It was incredibly foggy out and almost impossible to see anything clearly 20 feet ahead of you, so it could not be determined if the lights were on the body of a ship or craft. The lights stayed in our vision hovering over the water for almost ten minutes, at a time appearing to move closer to us. The reflection of the lights could be seen in the water, so it was apparently very close to the lake. The lights began to slowly fade, and then came back bright for an instant. Immediately afterwards right by the white lights two smaller bright red lights flashed, out of no where, disappeared, and then everything was gone. Also the whole incident was completely silent and no noise from the craft or anywhere else for that matter could be heard.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It may also be important to note that before the sighting, the friend I was with and I both watched on YouTube the ABC News report of a man called “Prophet Yahweh” who demonstrated or at least seemed to demonstrate the ability to summon UFOs. I know how this may sound but whether the clip was a complete hoax or not, the two of us went outside by the lake for the sole reason of wanting to spot a UFO, we did all the kind of believing and makeshift praying we could and after about 45 minutes and having somewhat given up, witnessed what was previously described.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Lying down I was staring out the window.  The window faces north; at about 1:00 in the eastern sky I saw a bright twinkling light.  It reminded me of a distant fire fly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I assumed it was a plane, but it did not move to the east, or west, nor did it come toward my home.  From this distance it appeared stationary.  I realized it was probably not a plane because there was no flashing light, nor did I see green or red light as you usually do when you see a plane pass by.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I watched, it slowly disappeared below the tree line in the north eastern sky.  I didn’t think it could be a plane then, because the direction was going away from me.  I assume then, that I was not looking at tail lights at that brightness and sparkle.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The background was a tree lined hill and pastures.  There are no suburban neighborhoods in that direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Borden Carleton is just over the Confederation Bridge.  I was looking out the window of my work place and I spotted a large light in the sky.  The light was a yellow light.  The light started to flash slowly in and out.  Then the light went out and 2 amber lights came on.  They flashed for 20 seconds then the big yellow light came back on.  This figure was moving very slow in the sky.  Now its a very clear night with a full moon and absolutely no wind.  I ruled out that its not a plane because of how slowly its moving.  I figured it might be the coast guard or some sort of helicopter. The figure is over the water and moving in land.  I seen it move alittle to the right, then move back on its track.  I was on the phone with my girlfriend and telling her what I was seeing.  I told her to hang on a second.  I decided to go outside to see if I could hear what kind of craft it was.  When I went outside, I didn&#39;t hear a thing.  So that yold me it not a plane or a helicopter.  So, its a full moon so I waited until it passed over the moons light, and noticed that it was the same size as a jet but there was no sound at all.  Also it was moving really slow!!  Theres no way it could be a jet.  It was kinda like a diamond shape.  Skinny looking front that got really wide.  It was flying extremely low.  My question is, Why was this figure flying so low, was very well lit up, and why didn&#39;t it make any noise??  I mentioned it to drivers in the area approximately the same time period, and they didn&#39;t see a thing.  It was the weirdest thing I&#39;ve ever seen!  Seeing it didn&#39;t really scare me.  It was the fact it was so low and didn&#39;t make any noise at all!! Anybody help me out with this??<n>

I spotted what at first thought was 2 shooting stars. The lights bright white in color were equal distances apart which was very odd. Neither one went slower or faster than the other, but stayed at a constant speed parallel with each other. There was no spin or rotation to the object(s).  The object(s) went from East to West at a high rate of speed. There did seem to be a smoke trail from each of the lights. As the lights flew off into the western horizon they both disappeared. I have tried rationalizing what I saw, but with no results other than it was very high up, and if it was one object with two lights then it must have been massive. Too big to be a jet due to its altitude and size that I observed. My father whom was with me did not see the object he was looking elsewhere.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

As this light got closer I realized that it was a yellow light and there were no flashing red, green or strobe lights visible.  Upon further observation as this object got closer I realized that this object was flying in a vertical position with yellow lights down the center and on vertical arms on both sides of the main body. The object changed directions slightly to the South West onto a heading of approx 210 degrees heading towards Orlando. Further to viewing this craft I observed that there was absolutely NO sound emitting from it.  This craft disappeared into the South West without appearing to speed up.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Approximately a minute or so later I observed two more similar craft coming from the North.  These two craft followed the same flight path and were traveling at the same altitude and speed as the first one that I reported.  The only difference was that the second craft was not lit up near as much as the first one.  The third craft was lit up more than the second one but not as much as the first one.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have been observing commercial aircraft on a regular basis here in Florida and they fly overhead and continue south to Miami or Fort Lauderdale.  The three unidentified craft I observed last evening turned to the South West which was not the normal flight pattern for commercial aircraft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In conclusion I cannot name what I saw, but I can say, the three objects I observed were NOT AIRCRAFT (jet, prop. Or helicopter)<n>

The object was flying vertical and its body was lit up solid yellowish with best as I can describe objects on either side (wing-like) they were also lit up but not solid it appeared to be individual lights outlining the entire wing structure.  The object did not have any other coloured lights or flashing lights.  The object continued south then changed direction to south west.  It disappeared or it was not visible from the back.  This abject did not have any sound whatsoever as it was a quiet peaceful night here.  Within a minute or so I observed two more of these objects flying in the same direction (one was flying before the other and the first one was not as bright as the original the third one was a little brighter than the second) they also followed what appeared to be the same path as the original object again no sound.  What I found extremely interesting is they were all vertical.  We are on a flight path of several jet planes and small prop planes none of which use this particular path I observed with these three objects<n>

The objects were not moving and were blinking steadily. After about 5 minutes one of the objects starting moving East and towards us. It was going semi-slow but it moved past us and we saw a disk shaped object with a yellow haze around it (maybe a forcefield?). It had red blinking lights with green non-blinking lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> That one went off into the darkness. We then started watching the other 2 lights, and one of them started to go northeast really fast and away from us. All of a sudden it turned blue and stopped and started to blink. We then paid attention to the other one that was not moving. All of a sudden the first object came blitzing back from the east down away from us to the west and disappeared. I called my mom who was across town at home and when she went outside she and my other brother saw an object quickly change directions and flutter.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The 3rd object did not move, but disappeared after about 20 minutes. It was surreal, I was definitely sure that other people would have seen this.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I know the time was at 5:59 pm eastern time because I had just called my friend Matt.  I thought that the lights must have been a plane whose lights were pointed directly at us because they were very bright.  It was also traveling in a downward motion and to the west.  From our position when we saw this I estimate that the object was close to a mile or two away.  I also thought it was a plane that must have been making an emergency landing or was facing an imminent crash because it was lower and brighter than any plane I had ever seen before.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So before we turned into my neighborhood we proceeded north on Kellers Church Rd. We went over a small bridge, continues, went around one bend to the left then a second to the right immediately after where Scott Road and Kellers Church Rd. meet. We continued trying to eye out the object/plane through the trees and went through a small set of woods and then there was a clearing between that small set of woods and another north. In that clearing we found ourselves to be near an unidentifiable object which I have never seen before. We were slightly to the South West of the object. It was above the treeline of the new set of woods, sitting there, hovering. It did not move in any direction at that point. It was just sitting there. I estimate it was only 150-300 ft above the treeline, which is seriously low. I have never seen any plane or object do such actions. We slowly came to a halt and we were all dumbfounded. This object appeared to be almost a diamond shape, and we were seeing it from the bottom, angled. There seemed to be a dominant light on the front (which appeared the brightest) and two light on the side of the object. Those two seemed dimmer and less dominant. The way all the lights were connected made ! the obje ct appear angular and almost diamond shaped. The car at this point was stopped. I tried to make a video using my sister&#39;s cell phone but it didn&#39;t come out. There was a distinct point, about 20-30 seconds after we were in awe looking at this object in which myself and Annie (sister to my gf) both felt as though this object/plane, whatever had noticed us and the front light that appeared to be dominant began shifting itself towards us. I freaked out and told April, my gf, to please just go. I had a sickly feeling in my stomach and I had never, ever seen anything like this. She hit the gas and we proceeded through the second set of wooded area and came out 15 seconds later. As we were traveling through the wooded area I kept watch on the object which had a bright light on what I would describe the back of it. At least as bright as the front dominant light. (these light may have appeared more dominant because there were facing us more directly than the other two had). My sister described the top of this object as having a spherical structure to it. We proceeded up the hill which lead to deep run road. We made a right and proceeded to try and follow the object, ended up being more round about of a road and by the time we came closer back to our original location, the object was gone. I could not find it in the night sky. The only object I could see in the sky were normal, blinking, red tinted planes. Planes I could identify normally. This obscure object vanished. I have no idea what happened to it, but myself and the three other people with me saw something we had never seen in our entire lives. This object furthermore had no engine sound. Annie described it as a buzzing, humming sound. After the incident I told many people and was informed of other sitings in the Bucks County Area. Please write back any inquiry or information you may have for us, or if others reported siting the same distinct object in the sky. This testimony is 100% truthful, I want to know if others saw it, if this object was on a radar, ! whatever you guys do to figure this stuff out, please let me know the details of your finding. You may contact me, ask me questions, etc. I will fully cooperate and I am intent on learning of what this was.<n>

I was on the south end of town and watched the object move south above the town, then it turned west once it passed the airport (heading for Santa Clara) and slowly gained altitude until it was no longer visible.  The entire event took about 20 minutes.  There were 3 objects which all seemed to be attached to each other vertically.  At first I thought it was a helicopter with fire buckets, or someone on a parachute.  The topmost was a white sphere; the bottom object was dark and triangular.  It had no lights and made no sound.  As soon as I lost sight of the object, I saw a helicopter which circled the airport in the opposite pattern of the 3 objects, then headed in the same general direction.  The noise from the helicopter was very noticeable and it flew much faster than the previous object.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Appearing in front of a particular dark cloud I saw two lights that were diagonal from each other (taller one on top left, bottom one on right).  They were perfectly still and fixed in position, after a second they slightly got brighter but then dissolved, along with what could have been the body of the craft between the lights which appeared dark grey to black.  As the entire image faded, it never moved in its position.  The duration could not have been more than 2 full seconds.  The lights appeared to be the normal whitish-yellow that a standard plane or car would have, nothing special.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It appeared to be about 4 times the size of a 737 plane, as compared at equal distance.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was still fairly dark outside so the object appeared to be extremely bright and white against the dark sky.  It was somewhat triangular in shape with rounded corners.  The object never moved in a horizontal manner.  After watching it remain still for about 2 minutes, the object slowly moved straight upwards until I lost sight of it from my vehicle.<n>
1/23/08 04:00|Newton|MA|Disk|under 1 min|I took my dog out and saw a lit up saucer shaped space craft for about 1 min in the sky and then it just turned off like a lightbulb|2/14/08|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/061/S61298.html|130|ndxe200801| I took my dog out and saw a lit up saucer shaped space craft for about 1 min in the sky and then it just turned off like a lightbulb<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am going to be brief. I just spoke with you (Peter Davenport) on the phone and you you seemed very busy and asked me to report what I saw online. So here is what happened.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I live on the 1st floor of a 2 story house. I was in my bedroom with my girlfriend and my dog at around 3:45-4:00 a.m watching t.v. I am always up late . I was lying in bed with my girlfriend and my dog was acting really weird making all sorts of noise and barking and she is always very quiet at night. I figured she had to go outside to go to the bathroom. So, I took my dog outside my front door with my girlfriend to have a cigarette and let my dog out . My dog is very well trained like I said and was acting sort of strange and as soon as I opened the door my dog ran into my neighbor’s yard which is very unlike her. She usually stays in our yard and does her business in our yard. So, I ran off the porch to go get my dog and when I got her I noticed a light above my head about 2 streets down. When I looked up I saw a saucer shaped craft in the sky. It looked like it was about a football field and a half to two football fields high up in the sky. At first I thought it was a meteor coming down  until it just came to a complete stop. Also, how low it was to the ground it just seemed strange to me. Also, it was a strange color. Almost a color I have never seen before just lit up in the sky like a strange colored saucer lightbulb. I would describe the color as purplish orangish yellowish green, I know that sounds strange but it was glowing of all those colors and that’s the only way I can describe it . Anyway, as I said I thought it was a meteror until I really looked at it. It was very low to the earth and it was traveling in a strait line and then it just stoped and hovered in the sky . That’s when I got a very bad feeling and called my girlfriend over. This disk in the sky was going in a straight line and then it just stopped for like 10 seconds and hovered. Then it moved in a way I have never seen a plane or anything of that matter on this earth. After the craft went in the strait line then stopped it was moving almost at like 90 degree angles. It would move one way and then turn and go another way and th! en turn and go another way like it was on a street taking turns or something. for example it would turn right then move up in the sky and then turn left then move down. I have never seen any kind of plane or helicopter do this so i removed that explanation immeditly. So from the beginning, the craft went in a straight line like it was a meteor and then it just came to a complete stop, it hovered for around 10 seconds and then starting moving again in a hovering fashion and was hovering and taking strange turns. The craft  looked like it was one big light switching to different illuminating colors and after about 1 minute of watching it the light just turned off like it had a switch to appear and disappear and then it never re-appeared. It didn’t take off real fast like in the movies or anything or as one would think; it just turned off like a lightbulb. I went back into my house with my girlfriend and my dog and just had the creepiest strangest feeling. I was so creeped out I woke my roommate up but of corse just like my mother he didn’t believe me, even though he could see me and my girlfriend were so worked up. I wasn’t on any drugs or anything and I know I wasn’t hallucinating because my girlfriend saw it to along with my dog.  I have never believed in anything like this until I saw the craft this one night. I have not shared this and did not report it to the police because I didn’t want anyone to think I was crazy. Then I saw your show and saw all those other people with cases like mine and it jsut made me want you to know what i saw and know more about it. I  decided to call you and when you called me back I knew this was serious and thought i would write you a description of this &#34;craft&#34;. I know there is something out there. Can you share with me what you think this is. I dont live close to any airports and i just know it was something not of this world.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

As many airports are near my location, I can differentiate between planes and other objects. As stars cannot move at the rate of speed that the UFO did, it is safe to say that it can be ruled out as well.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was no discernable shape, it appeared that the UFO was at least 50 miles north of my position, maybe more. It first appeared that it was going west, however, as soon as I spotted it, it began going southwest. 30 seconds later, as it was just about to exit my line of sight (I was viewing it from my bedroom window), it stopped and hovered for about twenty minutes.  It then disappeared without a trace.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous;  provides no contact information.  PD))<n>

It changed colors, pulsating from red to green and back to red. Hovered in a single location of the sky, rather than following a trajectory, and smoothly drifted up and to the left or down and to the right intermittantly. Observed through binoculars; did not see additional detail of the object, but did confirm that there were not two individual light sources - the object itself was changing colors.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Co-worker who lives in the same area observed three similar objects approximately 5 hours later, skimming over the water.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was westward from us and we saw it for approximately 7 seconds.

1/22/08 19:20|Cuenca (Ecuador)||Light|1 minute|0020 hours GMT I saw a white bright pinpoint  light brigher than Jupiter travelling South to North 2.5 faster than a satellite,|2/14/08|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/061/S61108.html|134|ndxe200801| 0020 hours GMT I saw a white bright pinpoint  light brigher than Jupiter travelling South to North 2.5 faster than a satellite,<n> <n><n> <n><n> At 19:20 hours local Ecuador time (GMT 00:20 hours) I saw a white bright light but could not discern the exact shape travelling fast with no sound from South to North almost directly overhead, slightly East of me about 10 degrees, in a straight line. The light didn&#39;t vary in intensity nor color, it was a pinpoint to my naked eye but very bright, it was pure white and brighter than any star or even Jupiter.  I am located in Cuenca, Ecuador which is in the southern third of the country about 7 degrees south of the Equator in the Andes.  The sky was 3/4 cloudy but with breaks sufficient to track the light visually as it was well above the cloud ceiling.  I first noticed it while standing in my back yard simply looking up at the stars through the cloud breaks. The air was clear however.  I first saw the light about 30 degrees off the Southern horizon and was able to track it intermittently through cloud breaks until about dead overhead, 90 degrees off the Western horizon. The sun had set about an hour before so it was not sun reflecting off a plane and it was going faster than any plane again with no sound at all.  It travelled at a steady speed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was not a satellite as satellites go much slower than the light I just saw.  The light I saw went about 2.5 to 3 times faster than a satellite. I am an ameteur astronomer and know satellite an standard 100 mile low orbit speeds very well ever since the Russians first sent up Sputnik. I have never seen a satellite even close to the brightness of the object this evening.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have never seen aircraft lights resembling this light. I&#39;m age 61 and have lived in major airport cities all my life and I have excellent vision (corrected with slight prescription glasses).  I didn&#39;t have time to rush in and grab my binoculars it was proceeding so fast so I simply observed it.  It took about 60 seconds estimated time to pass from 30 degrees off the Southern horizon to where I lost it due to solid clouds about 90 degrees perpendicular and slightly to the East of where I was standing. There was no wind nor interfering noise to blot out any noise form the light source.  Cuenca has an airport but I know the standard approach and exit flight paths and since there was no wind there would be no reason for planes to deviate from the standard flight approaches and exits.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have no idea what the light source was but it was steady, silent, white, very bright, travelling straight and fast (over the clouds). I stood outside a few minutes to see if it would &#34;come back&#34; or if there were more and I didn&#39;t see anything moving in the night sky at all.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

To our 2:00 low at first appeared one orange light then another, then three or four more.  All the lights seemed to be connected in that as the first    one we saw appear, disappeared.  They all traveled in apparent trajectory of about 45 degrees.  They moved in a downward direction along this path.  We thought at first it may have been fireworks.  The angle was wrong.  The light was different.  And when they flashed they seemed to not “sparkle” like fireworks.  The night sky was clear.  The moon was full yesterday.  It was about 15 degrees Fahrenheit.  We can not believe we actually saw this.  All three lanes of the highway were occupied.  We are not the only ones who saw this.  We wonder who else may report it though.  Being in this kind of shock is pretty exciting.  Ironically tonight when I came home I switched on National Geographic only to see Peter Jennings reporting on UFOs.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The window faces dew south. The light was circular in shape as you would see a star in the sky but, much too bright and too big due to its closeness. I stared at it for about 15-30 seconds when it dimed and turned in the sky and headed upward leaving a shadow around the object as it left. Itlooked like it was an eclipse. I jumped off the couch and grabbed my jacket to see what it was. There was not a cloud in the sky and the moon was full and very bright on the eastern sky. I did not see the object again.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Last night I was sitting out on our fire escape between 6 and 6:30 PM. I looked out to the north and in the distance saw a bright white light resembling a giant star moving straight up into the sky. After watching in for a few seconds I called my boyfriend out to show him what I was seeing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Being a skeptic he was more amazed than I was about the light in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We also saw commercial airplanes around the craft and they looked tiny in comparison, as did the stars visible in the sky. It was moving relatively quickly and now moving towards us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As it got closer it appeared possible that there were two curved wings coming off of the flying craft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We watched it until it disappeared behind our 11-story apartment building.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was no sound we could hear coming from it.<n>

I was going to hit the snooze button, but all of a sudden I saw  a brilliant, bright light coming from a spacecraft or something that looked like the sun and that I had never seen before.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was filled with panic and curiosity.  The object was hovering above the tree line of my forest. It was as big 50 full sized moons, and it looked as though it was very close to me, hovering, pointing at me! It couldn&#39;t have been the sun because it was bigger than I had ever seen the sun and as we all know the sun rises in the east!<n> <n><n> <n><n> After figuring this out I ran to the other side of the house and saw that at the east the sun had not even come up yet! I figured that I was just seeing things and I went back to bed. I woke up again at 6:52 ish, and dashed to the window.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I saw a few lights from where they were before, like something was there, but then as it went completely away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then, the shadow of the house came up showing that the sun had finally come up.<n>

The wind was bad in warsop, mansfield, nottinghamshire, england. At the time of the sighting and the craft  did seem  effected by this ! it was a diamond shape, with two flashing lights which could still be seen up to at least 20 miles away after it had passed us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The lights were flashing simultaneously and were flashing quickly and brightly, they seemed almost ultraviolet ? The weather was quite bad but because of how low the craft was flying there was no mistaking that it was not of this earth ! there was no sound so it was definately not a plane or hellicopter ! As it got into the distance it didnt go down or up, the light just vanished.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As it went accross the fields --and im being very very serious ! a beam of light came down from the craft and hit somewhere in sherwood forest ? it was more of a quick burst of energy !! as though it shot the ground with an energy beam or something fell from it ?? It came from the chesterfield area and headed over towards lincoln ! the shape was a 3d diamond i could not see if it was spinning or not ! A lot more people saw this object and all were shocked to see something like this over our skies ! We did have a sighting of a similar object a few months ago, i didnt see it personally but i did see 3 royal air force planes fly over very low a few minuites after tha alleged sightingand they were definately fighter planes ???? I will definately be keeping my eyes open more now ! It makes you wonder whats out there and if the conspiracies are true ?????????<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

I was driving and toward the end of our journey we were on a straight stretch of the road. My brother spotted 2 lights that seemed out of place in the sky. The approx time of the sighting was 8pm. My brother told me to pull over. I pulled over and we watched the 2 crafts in the sky. The crafts were over the western sky, they looked slightly bigger than the stars. and we were looking just over the tree line on top of the hills. 1 of the crafts started moving at a perfect horizontal line the second craft moved vertically. The vertical craft went what looked like behind the hills. The craft that went behind the hills shot straight up and out of sight. The second craft hovering above the hills followed a few seconds later. The sighting ended at 8:03pm.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

We did&#39;nt think much about it except that it was strange. They did not move. Than seemed right after that this THING was hovering right above us! When we got close there were a lot more lights! It seemed to be surrounded with bright white lights. The shape was that of an OVERSIXED STEALTH, maybe 10 times bigger. It seemed to span across the entire Interstate. This was nothing like we have ever seen. Since we drive a Semi Truck we could not get a better look or stop. If we could have stopped I would have taken a picture. If anybody driving that way at around that time seen this thing, could you please post it. Maybe you could describe it better from a car. It really was amazing !<n>

We’ve seen strange stuff in West Kilbride before, once, we were on our way to the Library and a middle-aged man was screaming and pointing to the sky, saying he’d seen black objects hover in the sky and then fly off.

Conditions: Moon waxing gibbous, 96% visible, time of transit 10:46 p.m., moon distance 228,156 miles.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Weather conditions: Temperature 210F, DP 70F, RH 55%, wind 3.5-7.5 SSW. Sky very clear with visibility excellent.  Witnesses view of sky is unobstructed. Lunar disk very bright and crisp with barely perceptible atmospheric edge glow.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Witnesses: **names deleted** dinner guests and main witness **name deleted**.  I had left his dinner party early, around 9:00 p.m. and was not a witness. All witnesses are  professional, informed and responsible people between the ages of 30 - 45 with good eyesight. For example, **name deleted** is a journalist and an associate newspaper editor, **name deleted** is an attorney at law and as a hobby is a professional-level portrait artist. He has a very acute eye for detail.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Just after 10: p.m., as his guests were leaving, **name deleted** noticed that a small section in the lower right quadrant (between the 4 to 5 o&#39;clock position) of the lunar disk was &#34;missing&#34; and called it to the attention of the others. Someone asked if there was an eclipse expected. Sam answered &#34;no&#34; but called me at home at 10:13 p.m. to confirm that there was no eclipse (I dabble in astronomy and the next eclipse visible here is a total, February 20, 2008), and asked me to take a look at the moon. My wife and I immediately went outside and checked the moon unaided and with 10 x 50 binoculars. Nothing abnormal was visible on the lunar disk from our location approximately 2.75  miles south of the **name deleted** residence.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Upon closer observation **name deleted** determined the black area&#39;s shape was actually triangular with a slightly rounded apex rather than the eclipse-disk-shape they originally assumed. It was oriented with the apex pointed toward and slightly below center of the lunar disk. He noticed that the object was very slowly withdrawing from the lunar disk. By the time he retrieved his camera, a smaller portion was visible due to the withdrawal motion, and this combined with the brilliance of the moon, completely washed out the object when he attempted to photograph it approximately 4 to 5 minutes later with an automatic Sony 6 megapixel camera.<n> <n><n> <n><n> He also noticed, when he changed his position 30-40 feet, the object&#39;s position seemed to change slightly in relation to the lunar background. This slight but detectable parallax would indicate  that they were viewing a very large, nearly stationary object closer to earth than the moon, in silhouette, between his position and the lunar disk. There was no penumbral shadowing noted as would be evident in a shadow cast by a large object between the sun and moon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> He estimated the sighting lasted about 8-10  minutes. During the time of observation the object completely withdrew from the lunar disk. As it withdrew,  nothing of the object could be seen outside the lunar disk which seems to indicate a very dark, non reflecting, large object at a considerable distance. By approximately 10:19 p.m. the object was no longer visible.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Size / Distance Estimates<n> <n><n> <n><n> Lunar disc circumference = 6790 miles  -:- 360 degrees = 18.86 miles per degree at periphery of lunar disk. Witnesses agree that the illustration accurately represents what they saw. Measuring the illustration, the widest point of the object subtends an angle of about 18 degrees of the lunar disk, which equals 339.48 miles. (180 X 18.86) For calculation purposes object width is rounded to 340 miles and  the sighting-date moon distance of 228,156 miles is rounded 228,000 miles..<n> <n><n> <n><n> The easiest way to get some feel for the size/distance question was to set the distance and size figures as two legs of a right triangle. Using a right triangle with leg A of 228,000 miles and leg B of 340 miles, chart below was created by halving A and B dimensions then halving the results repeatedly.  At minimum, I feel that the distance/object size ratio data after the seventh iteration (inside the box - below 1781 X 2.6 miles ), could not produce the observed phenomena.  Witnesses feel that a small object of 100 - 200 feet and close enough to produce observed effect would have been detected by them due to the brightness of the moonlight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Distance       Object  Size (Miles)    (Feet) 	       (Miles)	  Feet)  			228,000				340 			114,000				170 		         57,000		                 85 			  28,500			 42.5 			  14,250	                 21.2 			    7,125		         10.6 			    3,562			  5.3 			    1,781			  2.6 			      890			  1.3		 			      445			   .65 	3,432 			      222			          990 			      111			          495 			       55				  248 			       28	148,000			  124 			       14	74,000			   62					7	37,000				   31 				3.5	18,500			   15 			 	If object was a triangle there is no way to know if its silhouette was seen in its entirety or if only a portion of it —or which apex it might have been.  It could also have been a square or rectangular configuration with only a corner of the object occulting the disk. Obviously the exercise above cannot give any accurate clues as to the actual shape, size, or orientation of the object in relation to the observers, other than it was probably very large and quite distant. The viewing opportunity-window probably was limited to a small area around the viewing position.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Illustration Caption  View looking south. Motion of moon is to the right. Object slowly withdrew from the lunar disk as indicated by the arrow. The object&#39;s withdrawal motion could be caused by the movement of the object descending, reversing or changing its orientation relative to the observer.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Also possible considering the estimated 8 to10 minutes of time elapsed, the apparent withdrawal motion of the object, if stationary, could have been due to the moon&#39;s normal track toward the SSW. although the observer did not notice any radial movement along the disk that would have been evident.<n>

It tumbled approx. two to three hundred feet. It stopped then  took off horizontally to the right. I watched it fly in and out of the clouds until I lost it. It was flying  at a rate faster than anything I have seen. I have been around aircraft for many years and this was not the norm.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have one picture, taken while it is tumbling that shows two sets of lights and with in each set are seven to eight  smaller lights. It is white, but looks solid and not quite flat with lights in the front. Another picture is taken that shows it flying horizontally, no fixed wing or jet engine that I can see, at this point it looked flat. Other pictures are when it is too high to see any detail and these pictures were taken before I even noticed it tumbling.  It was only upon enlarging  these photos did I see it above the rainbow.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Later in the evening , when it was dark, I was walking home from my parents place next door and saw six or seven lights high in the sky. No formation but  all seemed to be flying the same speed. They were not like the airliners or private planes with blinking/strobe lights. The San Jose Airport path is almost directly over head so I am very familiar with their landing prep. These were solid, possibly military.  They were headed north.  I do not know if there was a connection to  my earlier sightings.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We have looked at the photo, and cannot tell what the object is.  It could be a bird, trash, or anything.  It is unidentifiable.  PD))<n>

After blinking my eyes several times, I followed the object and it appeared to go from one state of very bright light to a little difficult to see.  After witnessing this approximately 3-4 times, I called my husband to look at the “UFO” with me, (I don’t mean little green Martians kind of UFO, but just an unidentified flying object.)  I witness every single day the airplanes and helicopters flying overhead, but this was just a different thing to witness.  It was so high up in the sky that I first thought it might be a balloon, but the light was something I have never witnessed before.  My husband was intrigued enough to watch with me and then my sister-in-law and niece pulled up into our driveway and witnessed what we were seeing; Although, I know this can’t be a little green Martian thing, it was very intriguing and wanted to say that I don’t know what it was.  It did not make a sound, the light reflection of the sun from the south of me might explain why it got so bright at times, but I think I would have noticed something in all of my 39-years of looking at the skies.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Another reflection I would like to share was that there was no dimension, not a noticeable tail, nose or wing of a plane and then it just disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

PD))<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> This investigation was conducted with the cooperation and permission of Mr. Peter Davenport, director of the National UFO Reporting Center in Davenport, Washington who took the original report of the witness through his NUFORC reporting system.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> The original report is as follows minus witness personal  information:<n> <n><n> Date: 01/20/08<n> <n><n> Time:05:58 am<n> <n><n> Duration: 7 minutes<n> <n><n> Sighting City: East Dublin<n> <n><n> Sighting State: Georgia<n> <n><n> Sighting County: Laurens<n> <n><n> # of witnesses: 2<n> <n><n> Shape: Oval<n> <n><n> # of craft: 1<n> <n><n> Description: Landing of a 3 lighted, fairly large craft with pulsing red to amber lights. No sound at all.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Description by witness narrative:<n> <n><n> <n><n> I  wasn’t going to report this until I saw that someone else from this exact same city experienced something similar just two months ago. So, I decided to also write a report since there must obviously be something going on here that is unexplained and I would like answers.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Earlier this morning (Sunday Jan. 20th, 2008) at approximately 5:58 AM I decided to look out my front door to see if the ground was covered with ice (we had a lot of rain last evening and freezing temperatures overnight), and as I was looking out the front door I noticed something completely strange to my left.  It was floating above the tree line across from a field approximately ½ mile from my front door. The lights were pulsating from red to orange (similar to flames from a forest fire) as this thing or craft was slowly receding behind the tree line behind the open field” “It seemed to have three large lights from the side I was seeing. And judging from the neighbor’s house down the road and the distance this craft was from their home and ours, it had to be at least the size of 4 or 5 homes combined, possibly even larger. A truly amazing sight and a camera was the last thing on my mind”.<n> <n><n> <n><n> “Anyway, I couldn’t believe what I was seeing, so I went to wake my wife up to verify what I was seeing. She quickly awoke when I told her that she had to see something that was going to blow her mind. I was hoping this thing wouldn’t be gone before we made it back to the front door. When we both got to the front door it was still there and was now half way down behind the tree line. My wife said “oh my God, what is that?” We both looked at it in awe as it descended behind the trees and seemed to have landed”.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ‘The area it seemed to have landed in is near a creek in a swampy area.  In a place people wouldn’t  normally go or have good access to. All I could think is why would someone or something be landing there”.<n> <n><n> <n><n> “ My wife and I stared in the direction for nearly an hour to see if it was going to fly away. She described it as being similar to the sun going down behind the trees due to the brightness it displayed and the red and orange colors, but this definitely wasn’t the sun, it was only 5:58 AM and was in the north west during the dark of night. She was only able to see the top half of the object and the lights as it was already landing as I awoke her. We both couldn’t believe what we had just seen. This definitely was like nothing I had ever seen, especially this close to our own home.. I must mention that I am prior military (US. Army Veteran) and I am very observant and have an IQ of 138. This definitely didn’t seem like any modern day aircraft that our military would have and even if it were, why would they land in the middle of the swampy creek area at 5:58 AM on a Sunday morning”? “As far as the shape of the craft, it seemed to be an oval shape and had no sound at all as we stepped out the front door to listen as it was landing. Another thing that was real odd was that this is in a suburban neighborhood with lots of yard animals and none of the dogs were barking at all and the air was dead silent”.<n> <n><n> <n><n> “As big as the object was and as bright as the lights were, we were expecting to at least hear the neighborhood dogs barking, but none were”.<n> <n><n> <n><n> “After waiting on the front porch of our home for close to an hour with blankets to keep warm, we finally decided to go back into the house. We were hoping this craft would come back up from the wooded area and would show itself once again while leaving, but it never did. And no, I don’t plan on going in that area of the woods and swamp to see it close up either. I will be keeping a guarded eye on that area for the next few nights and even months to see if anything else happens there”.<n> <n><n> <n><n> “All I can say about this is that we’re definitely not alone and these things are making themselves known. I’m just wondering why they aren’t trying to communicate more clearly if they are superior life forces. It\ almost feels as though we are like the ants living in the ant farm and they just observe us when they want to. A little food for thought there.”.<n> <n><n> <n><n> “Anyway, thanks for allowing me to vent about this here, because I surely can’t tell me friends(sic) about this. I’m not sure how they would take it”.<n> <n><n> <n><n> END OF ORIGINAL REPORT!  Upon receiving the permission of Mr. Peter Davenport to investigate this sighting report he sent this Field Investigator for MUFON the witness contact information.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I contacted the witness by phone and set up an appointment at his home for January 31st, 2008 at 3PM.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The primary witness is  married with two children, a boy  and a girl . He owns his own business. His wife  works at a local business. Their residence was very clean and modern.  East Dublin, Ga. is a very clean and prosperous appearing town located in Laurens County, Ga. long: w 82.9 and lat: n 32.5.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This FI arrived at the witness’ address at 1PM on 1/31/08  and spent the next hour scouting the area of the sighting and getting the lay-out of the community/neighborhood surrounding the residence.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Moving North passed the residence on the road they live , on the right side of the road at approximately 100 feet distance from witness” driveway is a high-end subdivision  made up of approximately 1 acre parcels with large,modern homes which are located in an open, spacious property with a view across its expanse of approximately ½ mile in most directions. The road upon which the witness lives dead ends 1.10 miles into another road that runs in a West to East direction.  100 yards to the East on this road is a Georgia Power Company grid line of tall electrical towers. On the North side of this road the grid can be seen running at the foot of a long ridge (hill) approximately 250 to 300 feet high in a West to Easterly direction. This power line grid crosses over this road in a South Eastern direction where a creek crosses under the roadway at a bridge and the creek and the grid together runs into and through a swampy, mixed forest area of several 100’s of acres. The creek has created a boggy, wet-land area and there are no roads, paths, or other entrances into this location, which is the direction of the witness’ sighting from his residence of 1.10 miles south of the creek.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Heading back South on the witness’ road I went to the junction with another Georgia highway and headed East for 3 ½ miles. This road lead me to a power substation in 2 miles from the resident’s road. I also noticed the other side of the ridge and swampy wet-land with several tree farms and cotton fields for the 3 ½ miles. Back at the residence, directly in front of it is a tree farm . This appeared to have a road that runs around the South border of the subdivision that may give access to the power-grid approximately 1 mile away that crosses both of the other roads in the area. However this land is posted with a locked gate with no contact information given on signs. Witness does not know who owns this property.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Leaving the neighborhood I drove back into East Dublin business district and decided to have lunch at a very small, one room restaurant . I enquired of the owner if he had heard of any UFO sightings. He had not.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I arrived at the witness’ residence at 3PM. He was warm and friendly but was still plenty excited about what he and his wife had witnessed the morning of 1/20/08 and began immediately showing me the area and recapping the event. Inside the home I conducted an interview and at first brought up the issue of the time of the sighting at 05:58 AM mentioned several times in the original report, inquiring  as to what he was doing up at that time of morning after a cold, rainy, stormy night, on a day most would “sleep in”. The witness stated he arose to check for “snow” as the local weather provider had said it was a possibility that night and he wanted to show it to the family.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This FI having checked the weather report, etc. before my interview, indicating according to the U.S. Naval Observatory Astronomical Department as follows: For the East Dublin area 1/20/08 @ 04:21 AM EST- winds had been out of the NW with gusts up to 20 MPH. There had been rain over the area for several hours: humidity averaged 81 % .  A severe weather system had moved across Georgia the evening of 1/19/08 and on into 1/20/08. Temperature averaged around 47* F. No snow recorded in the area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Sunrise 1/20/08 was @ 7:32AM EST. The Moon was waxing  Gibeous with a (95% disk surface showing/ illuminated and was 2 days before full which set at the “exact” time of 05:58 AM that morning 1/20/08(Thanks to MUFON ASD GA. MARK AUSMUS for exact moon charts) Charts on file. Witness said the sky was clear at the time of the sighting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Please note that the lack of animal activity (barking of dogs) that the witness originally reported does not seem to this FI to be in anyway connected to the sighting as most critters, especially family yard dogs would be bedded down after such a weather system that lasted around 12 hours  and 2 hours before sunrise.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Nothing appears unusual of this time frame(at this time) and the witness remembers seeing the exact time of 05:58 AM on the DVD player near the front door from which the sighting took place, which he showed me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The witness had viewed the object as he looked out of the decorative glass, front door panel, noticed the lights and opened the door.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Recapping( again) the sighting as recorded in the original report, I had the witness go over the statement about the size estimate . I discovered that what he actually saw were 3 large, bright red/orange lights encapsulated inside a half “dome” shape, rounded part to the top, and the 3 lights were inside, tapered back from the bottom to the top as if they were  3 panels of light. The panels of light appeared “fire like” the sun, rather than pulsating. Estimating the size of the object was based on a neighbors house approximately ¼ mile North on his road. I had him do a measure at arms length exercise and we determined the object to be 1 ½ inches to 2 inches at arms length, making the object 100 to 175 feet in length along its bottom at 1 mile distance.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The entire period of the actual event was 7 to 8 minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Next the witness took me outside to show the exact location ( again) where he saw the object and where his wife joined him on the porch. The direction was North, North East, not NNW as originally reported. It was NNE across the open area over the subdivision at approximately 3/4/ to 1 mile distance according to my compass readings and previous drive through observations. If the object had been floating down behind the ridge line off the other road north of the location, it would not have lit up the trees, like the witness stated to this FI, and it did light up trees located closer to a small pond located on the North East side of the subdivision. It appeared to come down behind the silhouette of one specific, large pine tree near the pond about ¼ mile away but the distance was probably closer to a ½  to 1 mile away in the swamp land. The witness stated that the object maneuvered “blimp like”, moving very slowly and drifting down from about an 80 degree angle above the large pine tree and there was sky line well below the object estimated at about 100 to 150 feet above the large pine tree. Again, I wish to emphasize, as this FI viewed the exact angle of the objects dissent, it would have had to go down in front of the ridge line located on  the  other road to the north , not behind it. Again, this ridge is 1.10 miles from the residence and an astronomical object would have went down behind the ridge.<n> <n><n> <n><n> That would put the object going down into the swamp off the northern border road.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I next spoke to the second witness, the wife, by phone at her place of business and her description was as the original report, but reiterated that “it looked like the Sun going down at Sunset”.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I asked if she had noticed anything unusual sense the sighting. She stated that their house lights had been surging up and down over that day and a few days following. At this phone interview (on speaker phone) her husband recalled with her that the automatic, dawn to dusk, mercury vapor light in the driveway had gone out as well during that time and had not come back on. This driveway light has sense been repaired and both bulb and sensor had to be replaced. The witness also remembered at this time that he had been having all the rechargeable batteries in their cell phones, remote keyboard to his business computer and the children’s electronic toys in his home office being drained of their charges. He would charge them up and next day they would be uncharged. This FI after returning to Savannah discovered that my brand new camera’s batteries were completely drained and I had put new ones in that morning before leaving for East Dublin. Coincidence? Maybe! Witness had also noticed an intermiten humming sensation/noise  in his and his wife’s ears for 3 weeks after the sighting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had the witness file a formal complaint with the Georgia Power Company and at first the customer service representative said that they are not able to look up previous  power problems. Instead they did a new report on the fact that witness was experiencing humming noise and “possible power surges sense the 19th-20th through the end of January 08. No mention was made of the battery drainage to Georgia Power company. A Ga. Power technician was dispatched to the residence that day. The witness inquired if they could explain the humming sensations and the power fluctuations, or any other problems for that time period.  The Technician’s log book indicated that 2 power sub-stations went out between January 20th and 21st, in the area. He unlocked the house’s power meter and did a few tests inside the meter ands stated it was working fine. The humming noise was not detected and the technician could only say that what had been happening must have been caused by the 2 downed sub-stations . The Technician could give no explaination for the substations failures. At this writing the only problem electrically , seems to be the continual drain of freshly charged batteries in the home. This FI nor the witness can figure this out at this time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This FI first speculated that the witnesses may have seen the “Moon set” as it did in fact set at exactly the same moment the object seemed to land in the swamp. However, the Moon set in a wooded area directly” behind” the residence and was about 120 degrees in the opposite direction in the West North Westerly location at the time of the sighting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The witness stated that the object never rose up after 1 hour . After approximately 30 minutes of waiting for the object to rise , a meteor, which the witness described as normal except that it was very short in duration with only a very short trajectory of about 1 to 2 inches at arms length appearing. They speculated that they felt it was connected in some way with the object. This FI does not.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As the witness’ children arrived from school on the day of the interview/investigation, he introduced me to them and I interviewed them briefly. They had not seen anything, but knew all about the details. The  daughter had had a “nightmare” about seeing the lights similar to what her parent’s had described and had drawn a picture (on file) of the object. She slept with her parent’s that night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This FI does not believe this was a “recall” experience by the child but simply that this incident has impacted this family in a stressful and negative way.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The witness claims to have a high IQ and so does his  son. The witness has been troubled over the fact that he cannot reconcile what he saw with what he knows to be normal and logical, He has stated to this FI that it affected him as he has become protective and concerned for the families safety more than usual.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This FI believes  the daughter has seen and heard her parent’s attempts to explain the incident and became fearful.  I told the witness to consider playing down the incident to help his daughter overcome her initial fears. He agreed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This FI has 35 years experience as a professional clinical counselor and 27 years as a Christian Pastor and I can say with some certain knowledge that the witnesses (husband &amp; wife) have experienced something that has disturbed their normal life in a dramatic way and this disturbance has spilled over to their children. I have checked back once per week with the witness as of this writing and they are still trying to figure out what they saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n> UFO TOOLS website gives this case with the evidence available at a 57.5% reliability, strangeness 14.29%, info quality 10%, certainty 00.82% Valle classification is FB1 possibly FB2 considering the electrical circumstantial evidence.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The probability of the object being a plasma ball over  the power grid would be highly likely except for the fact that it was first seen moving 100 to 150 feet above the tree line that hides the grid line from line of sight from the witness’ front porch. Along with the appearance of being a “dome” or half a circle/sphere with lighted panels ,this probability is slim .<n> <n><n> <n><n> FYI/ The witness mentioned the reason he made the report was because of another sighting in East Dublin 2 months prior. This incident also was reported to NUFORC on 11/26/2007. The report is similar at first examination and I can see why this witness of 1/20/08 was prompted to file his report.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was unfortunate that this FI was unable to gain access to the swampy area where the object went down to check for traces of its presence. However, due to the overall evidence of the circumstances and the insistence of the witness to remain anonymous, and the consistency of the testimonies and the adverse affect it had on the them and their children, I conclude at this time that this case should be classified “unknown”. However, this case will remain open for this FI and contact with these witnesses will continue until I am personally satisfied they have some closure.<n> <n><n> <n><n> David I.

So, I decided to also write a report since there must obviously be something going on here that is unexplained and I would like answers.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Earlier this morning (Sunday Jan. 20th, 2008) at approximately 5:58 AM I decided to look out of my front door to see if the ground was covered with ice (we had a lot of rain last evening and freezing temperatures overnight), and as I was looking out the front door I noticed something completely strange to my left. It was floating above the tree line across from a field approximately 1/2 mile from my front door. The lights were pulsating from red to orange (similar to flames from a forest fire) as this thing or craft was slowly receding behind the tree line behing the open field.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It seemed to have three large lights from the side I was seeing. And judging from the neighbors house down the road and the distance this craft was from their home and ours, it had to be atleast the size 4 or 5 homes combined, possibly even larger. A truly amazing site and a camera was the last thing on my mind.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Anyway, I couldn&#39;t believe what I was seeing, so I went to wake my wife up to verify what I was seeing. She quickly awoke when I told her that she had to see something that was going to blow her mind. I was hoping this thing wouldn&#39;t be gone before we made it back to the front door. When we both got to the front door it was still there and was now half way down behind the tree line. My wife said &#34; oh my God, what is that?&#34;. We both looked at it in awe as it descended behind the trees and seemed to have landed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The area it seemed to have landed in is near a creek in a swampy area. In a place people wouldn&#39;t normally go or have good access to. All I could think is why would someone or something be landing there.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My wife and I stared in the direction for nearly an hour to see if it was going to fly away. She described it as being similar to the sun going down behind the trees due to the brightness it displayed and the red and orange colors, But this definitely wasn&#39;t the sun, it was only 5:58 AM and was in the north west during the dark of night. She was only able to see the top half of the object and the lights as it was already landing as I awoke her. We both couldn&#39;t believe what we had just seen. This definitely was like nothing I had ever seen, especially this close to our own home. I must mention that I am prior military (U.S. Army Veteran) and I am very observant and have an IQ of 138. This definitely didn&#39;t seem like any modern day aircraft that our military would have and even if it were, why would they land in the middle of the swampy creek area here at 5:58 AM on a Sunday morning?  As far as the shape of the craft, it seemed to be an oval shape and had no sound at all as we stepped out of the front door to listen as it was landing. Another thing that was real odd was that this is in a suburban neighborhood with lots of yard animals and none of the dogs were barking at all and the air was dead silent.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As big as the object was and as bright as the lights were, we were expecting to at least hear the neighborhood dogs barking, but none were.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After waiting on the front porch of our home for close to an hour with blankets to keep warm, we finaly decided to go back into the house. We were hoping this craft would come back up from the wooded area and would show itself once again while leaving, but it never did. And no, I don&#39;t plan on going in that area of the woods and swamp to see it close up either. I will be keeping a guarded eye on that area for the next few nights and even months to see if anything else happens there.<n> <n><n> <n><n> All I can say about all this is that we&#39;re definitely not alone and these things are making themselves known. I&#39;m just wondering why they aren&#39;t trying to communicate more clearly if they are superior life forces. It almost feels as though we are like the ants living in the ant farm and they just observe us when they want to. A little food for thought there.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Anyway, thanks for allowing me to vent about this here, because I surely can&#39;t tell me friends about this.

I’m not sure how they would take it.&#34;<n> <n><n> <n><n> END OF ORIGINAL REPORT!  Upon receiving the permission of Mr. Peter Davenport to investigate this sighting report he sent this Field Investigator for MUFON the witness contact information.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I contacted the witness by phone and set up an appointment at his home for January 31st, 2008 at 3PM.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The primary witness is  married with two children, a boy  and a girl . He owns his own business. His wife  works at a local business. Their residence was very clean and modern.  East Dublin, Ga. is a very clean and prosperous appearing town located in Laurens County, Ga. long: w 82.9 and lat: n 32.5.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This FI arrived at the witness’ address at 1PM on 1/31/08  and spent the next hour scouting the area of the sighting and getting the lay-out of the community/neighborhood surrounding the residence.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Moving West past the residence on the road they live , on the right side of the road at approximately 100 feet distance from witness&#39;s driveway is a high-end subdivision  made up of approximately 1 acre parcels with large ,modern homes which are located in an open, spacious property with a view across its expanse of approximately ½ mile in most directions. The road upon which the witness lives dead ends 1.10 miles into another road that runs in a South to North direction.  100 yards to the North on this road is a Georgia Power Company grid line of tall electrical towers. On the South side of this road the grid can be seen running at the foot of a long ridge (hill) approximately 250 to 300 feet high in a South to North direction. This power line grid crosses over this road in a  Eastern direction where a creek crosses under the roadway at a bridge and the creek and the grid together runs into and through a swampy, mixed forest area of several 100’s of acres. The creek has created a boggy, wet-land area and there are no roads, paths, or other entrances into this location, which is the direction of the witness’ sighting from his residence of 1.10 miles from of the creek.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Heading back East on the witness’ road I went to the junction with another Georgia highway and headed North for 3 ½ miles. This road led me to a power substation in 2 miles from the resident’s road. I also noticed the other side of the ridge and swampy wet-land with several tree farms and cotton fields for the 3 ½ miles.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Back at the residence, directly in front of it is a tree farm . This appeared to have a road that runs around the North border of the subdivision but aerial maps indicate that it does not run far enough around to give access to the presumed landing area and falls short at least  ¾ of a mile from it, ending in the forest  behind the subdivision. Another road West of residence of witness does give access through a home owner’s property, but the witness is reluctant for them to be contacted at this time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Leaving the neighborhood I drove back into East Dublin business district and decided to have lunch at a very small, one room restaurant . I enquired of the owner if he had heard of any UFO sightings. He had not.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I arrived at the witness’ residence at 3PM. He was warm and friendly but was still plenty excited about what he and his wife had witnessed the morning of 1/20/08 and began immediately showing me the area and recapping the event. Inside the home I conducted an interview and at first brought up the issue of the time of the sighting at 05:58 AM mentioned several times in the original report, inquiring  as to what he was doing up at that time of morning after a cold, rainy, stormy night, on a day most would &#34;sleep in.&#34; The witness stated he arose to check for &#34;snow&#34; as the local weather provider had said it was a possibility that night and he wanted to show it to the family.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This FI having checked the weather report, etc. before my interview, indicating according to the U.S. Naval Observatory Astronomical Department as follows: For the East Dublin area 1/20/08 @ 04:21 AM EST- winds had been out of the NW with gusts up to 20 MPH. There had been rain/sleet over the area for several hours: humidity averaged 81 % .  A severe weather system with lots of lighting activity had moved across Georgia the evening of 1/19/08 and on into 1/20/08. Temperature averaged around 47* F. No snow recorded in the area. But witness indicated there was ice everywhere 1/20/08 Sunrise 1/20/08 was @ 7:32AM/ EST. The Moon was waxing  Gibeous with a (95% disk surface showing/ illuminated and was 2 days before full which set at the &#34;exact&#34; time of 05:58 AM that morning 1/20/08(Thanks to MUFON ASD GA. MARK AUSMUS for exact moon charts) Charts on file. Witness said the sky was clear at the time of the sighting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Please note that the lack of animal activity (barking of dogs) that the witness originally reported as unusual does not seem to this FI to be in anyway connected to the sighting as most family yard dogs would be bedded down after such a weather system that lasted around 12 hours  and 2 hours before sunrise.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Nothing appears unusual of this time frame(at this time) and the witness remembers seeing the exact time of 05:58 AM on the DVD player near the front door from which the sighting took place, which he showed me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The witness had viewed the object as he looked out of the decorative glass, front door panel, noticed the lights and opened the door.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Recapping ( again) the sighting as recorded in the original report to NUFORC, I had the witness go over the statement about the size estimate . I discovered that what he actually saw were 3 large, bright red/orange lights encapsulated inside a half &#34;dome&#34; shape, rounded part to the top, and the 3 lights were inside, tapered back from the bottom to the top as if they were  3 panels of light. The panels of light appeared &#34;fire like&#34; the sun, rather than pulsating. Estimating the size of the object by the witness was based on a neighbors house approximately ¼ mile West on his road. I had him do a measure at arms length exercise and we determined the object to be 1 ½ inches to 2 inches at arms length. This FI using www.ufotools.com their website calculations estimated the size at a ground distance of approx. 5000ft.(1524 m) at an angle of elevation 10 degress based on the terrain lay-out from the witness’ front porch at eye level. The estimated length of the object at the base of the ½  dome was approx.93.624 ft.(28 m). The altitude estimate was 882 ft (269m). FYI/ this FI is comfortable with the distant from the witness calculation of 93 ft. due to the fact the object could have been as close as ½ mile and as far as 1 mile due to the angle in which it was viewed across various landscape/terrain. There was no way to get an exact measurement from either side of the objects landing area. One being a neighbor’s yard that the witness didn’t want me to contact and the inaccessible swamp on the  other .<n> <n><n> <n><n> The entire time period of the actual event was 7 to 8 minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Google maps of the location will follow at a later date.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Next the witness took me outside to show the exact location ( again) where he saw the object and where his wife joined him on the porch. The direction was North, North West,  as originally reported. It was NNW across the open area over the subdivision at approximately 3/4/ to 1 mile (approx. 5000ft) distance according to my compass readings and previous drive through observations. If the object had been floating down behind the ridge line off the other road north of the location, it would not have lit up the trees, like the witness stated to this FI, and it did light up trees located closer to a small pond located on the North West side of the subdivision. It appeared to come down behind the silhouette of one specific, large pine tree near the pond about ¼ mile away but the distance  of the object was probably closer to a 3/4  to 1 mile away in the swamp land. The witness stated that the object maneuvered &#34;blimp like,&#34; moving very slowly and drifting down from about an 80 degree flat , right to left angle above the large pine tree and there was sky line well below the object estimated at about 100 to 150 feet above the large pine tree. Again, I wish to emphasize, as this FI viewed the exact angle of the object’s dissent seen by the witness, it would have had to go down in front of the ridge line located on  the  other road to the West , not behind it. Again, this ridge is  approx. 1.5 miles from the residence and an astronomical object would have went down behind the ridge.<n> <n><n> <n><n> That would put the object going down into the swamp off the Western border road.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I next spoke to the second witness, the wife, by phone at her place of business and her description was as the original report, but reiterated that &#34;It looked like the Sun going down at Sunset.&#34;<n> <n><n> <n><n> I asked if she had noticed anything unusual since the sighting. She stated that their house lights had been surging up and down over that day and a few days following. At this phone interview (on speaker phone) her husband recalled with her that the automatic, dawn to dusk, mercury vapor light in the driveway had gone out as well during that time and had not come back on. This driveway light has sense been repaired and both bulb and sensor had to be replaced. The witness also remembered at this time that he had been having all the rechargeable batteries in their cell phones, remote keyboard to his business computer and the children’s electronic toys in his home office being drained of their charges. He would charge them up and next day they would be discharged. This FI after returning to Savannah discovered that my brand new camera’s batteries were completely drained and I had put new ones in that morning before leaving for East Dublin. Coincidence? Maybe! Witness had also noticed an  intermittent  humming sensation/noise  in his and his wife’s ears for 3 weeks after the sighting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had the witness file a formal complaint with the Georgia Power Company and at first the customer service representative said that they are not able to look up  previous  power problems. Instead they did a new report on the fact that witness was experiencing humming noise and &#34;possible power surges sense the 19th-20th through the end of January 08. No mention was made of the battery drainage to Georgia Power Company. A Ga. Power technician was dispatched to the residence that day. The witness inquired if they could explain the humming sensations and the power fluctuations, or any other problems for that time period.  The Technician’s log book indicated that 2 power sub-stations went out between January 20th and 21st, in the area. He unlocked the house’s power meter and did a few tests inside the meter ands stated it was working fine. The humming noise was not detected and the technician could only say that what had been happening must have been caused by the 2 downed sub-stations . The  GP Technician could give no explaination for the substations failures. At this writing the only problem electrically , seems to be the continual drain of freshly charged batteries in the home. This FI nor the witness can figure this out at this time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This FI first speculated that the witnesses may have seen the &#34;Moon set&#34; as it did in fact set at exactly the same moment the object seemed to land in the swamp. However, the Moon set in a wooded area directly &#34;behind&#34; the residence and was about 90 degrees in the opposite direction in the West South Westerly location at the time of the sighting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The witness stated that the object never rose up after 1 hour . After approximately 30 minutes of waiting for the object to rise , a meteor, which the witness described as normal except that it was very short in duration with only a very short trajectory of about 1 to 2 inches at arms length appearing. They speculated that they felt it was connected in some way with the object. This FI does not.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As the witness’ children arrived from school on the day of the interview/investigation, he introduced me to them and I interviewed them briefly. They had not seen anything, but knew all about the details. The  daughter had had a &#34;nightmare&#34; about seeing the lights similar to what her parent’s had described and had drawn a picture (on file) of the object. She slept with her parent’s that night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This FI does not believe this was a &#34;recall&#34; experience by the child but simply that this incident has impacted this family in a stressful and negative way.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The witness claims to have a high IQ and so does his  son. The witness has been troubled over the fact that he cannot reconcile what he saw with what he knows to be normal and logical, He has stated to this FI that it affected him as he has become protective and concerned for the families safety more than usual.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This FI believes  the daughter has seen and heard her parent’s attempts to explain the incident and became fearful.  I told the witness to consider playing down the incident to help his daughter overcome her initial fears. He agreed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This FI has 35 years experience as a professional clinical counselor and 27 years as a Christian Pastor and I can say with some certain knowledge that the witnesses (husband &amp; wife) have experienced something that has disturbed their normal life in a dramatic way and this disturbance has spilled over to their children. I have checked back once per week with the witness as of this writing and they are still trying to figure out what they saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n> UFO TOOLS website gives this case with the evidence available at a 57.5% reliability, strangeness 14.29%, info quality 10%, certainty 00.82% Valle classification is FB1 possibly FB2 considering the electrical circumstantial evidence.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The probability of the object being a plasma ball  over  the power grid would be highly likely except for the fact that it was first seen moving 100 to 150 feet above the tree line that hides the grid line from line of sight from the witness’ front porch. Along with the appearance of being a &#34;dome or half a circle/sphere with lighted panels , this probability is slim . This FI contacted FI Brion Trainor/ a retired electrical engineer and team member of MUFONGA/ Coastal Georgia and he advised that due to the altitude the object was first seen and it’s coloration , that indeed, a plasma ball was very unlikely.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This FI also personally spoke with all 3 departments of Law Enforcement in Laurens County. East Dublin PD, Dublin PD and Laurens County Sheriff’s Department. None have received any UFO or unusual  aeriel  phenomenon reports as far back as memory serves them. I spoke either to the Chiefs or their Ranking officers and they were very cooperative and want to be contacted in the future regarding any such report and will contact this FI should they receive reports of this nature in their respected departments.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Also this FI has contacted a newspaper reporter to look into any media for that area that may have received reports for the sighting’s time frame of 1/20/08. Any information forth coming will be posted as received.<n> <n><n> <n><n> FYI/ The witness mentioned the reason he made the report was because of another sighting in East Dublin 2 months prior. This incident also was reported to NUFORC on 11/26/2007. The report is similar at first examination and I can see why this witness of 1/20/08 was prompted to file his report.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was unfortunate that this FI was unable to gain access to the swampy area where the object went down to check for traces of its presence. However, due to the overall evidence of the circumstances and the insistence of the witness to remain anonymous, and the consistency of the testimonies and the adverse affect it had on the them and their children, I conclude at this time that this case should be classified &#34;unknown.&#34; However, this case will remain open for this FI and contact with these witnesses will continue until I am personally satisfied they have some closure.<n> <n><n> <n><n> David I.

We were traveling south on the Garden State Parkway when we saw a bell-shaped UFO above the horizon to our front-left. At first we assumed it was a normal plane simply too far away to make out correctly. Then, while I was absentmindedly staring at it, it simply vanished.  I was stunned.  I began informing my father about what I had just seen when I noticed it had reappeared many miles west from where it disappeared. This happened approximately three more times in a span of about 4 minutes. (While this was happening, I was lucky enough to have my camera with me, so I started snapping a few pictures.) Then it finally vanished from plain view for about five minutes. Then I noticed a jet-fighter flying high in the sky, moving west to east over the trees on the right side of the highway. As I began thinking this could somehow be related to the UFO I had just seen, I noticed it was actually pursuing a UFO of the same description.  I witnessed this happen for about fifteen seconds when a second UFO appeared behind and slightly below the jet-fighter. Seconds later both UFOs vanished before my eyes and the jet-fighter was left alone in the sky. For the rest of the ride home, the sky remained UFO-less but I noticed at least a dozen jet-fighters in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I suddenly saw this huge bright object and I knew it was not a planet,  coming from the north and as it got closer, I could tell it was a rectangular shape as it had multicolored lights all around it and one solid green light underneath.  All of a sudden it stopped and a few seconds later probably 10, a second object which looked to be like the same as the other one pulled up beside it and there was a red beam of light, looking like a laser but much wider projected to the first object for another 20 to 30 seconds and then it retracted. About 20 more seconds the first object started moving south and then made a quick left and accelerated at a fast speed going east and then it just disappeared. The second object still hovering so to speak, rose upwards, turned and headed back in a north direction from where it came and also suddenly disappeared. This was very strange indeed and I never saw anything like it before and I still wonder just what was that red laser beam of light was and if they were transferring something or repairing something.  Both objects were, I perceive to be of a vast size.  I can&#39;t believe, no one else did not see these things.  I do not drink or do drugs and my mind was clear as a bell!.  However, now my mind is pondering on what I saw. Thank you for your time in listening to my sighting of two objects which I do believe were not of this world, but I suppose it could be anyone&#39;s guess or speculation.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
1/20/08 00:15|Memphis|TN|Sphere|10 minutes|I saw a bright orange sphere that hung in the sky for nearly 10 minutes!|1/21/08|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/061/S61023.html|180|ndxe200801| I saw a bright orange sphere that hung in the sky for nearly 10 minutes!<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was outside walking my dog when I looked into the northern sky and saw a bright orange light approaching extremely slow.  It was a sphere shape and would have been about as big as one of those lamps on top of a tower.  As it got closer it was obvious that it was some kind of air craft, not a meteorite or any sort of space debris just by the shear fact that it was moving so slow.  The object was high in the sky and didn&#39;t make a noise as it passed over.  I know it couldn&#39;t have been a plane, because any planes that come into this area of Memphis are preparing to land at the International Airport and would be much lower.  The orange light that the craft emitted was bright like fire, but constant like a light bulb.  The craft took nearly 10 minutes to cross the sky, as I had time to call two of my friends while I was watching it!  This was the most eerie, awesome thing I&#39;ve ever seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.  PD))<n>

This occurred to me to be unusual and I continued to look at the object thinking at first that it might be some type of comet, or a really slow shooting star trailing debris.  It looked like some points in the string were brighter than other points.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I continued to observe the object for several minutes it changed shape and appeared to condense into a sphere shape.  I am unsure if it was a single object or several smaller objects.  There was a very bright star in the background, and a tree in the foreground.  I noticed the object moving  from side to side (in an east west manner) relative to both of these objects.  I do not recall it moving above the star though.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I walked south a bit more to get out of the lights of my complex and try to get a better look, by that time the object was smaller and dimmer and I can’t be certain if it was my eyes playing tricks on me or not, but it looked like the object (it looked singular at this point) had dimmed and was moving back and forth in a very small area very rapidly.  It was at this point I discontinued my observation after several minutes had passed.  The object, in addition to changing direction several times, appeared to brighten and dim several times.<n> <n><n> <n><n> If I had to draw my own conclusion I would say it was some type of balloon, or a group of balloons strung together that was released from the ground.  Why someone would release balloons at 9pm I cannot say, but that still doesn’t explain why it initially appeared so bright.  reflection from the lights below can only explain so much and at this time of evening it is pretty dark outside and the lights of La Mesa not that bright unless they were all foil type balloons.  My other thought is that the bright star I observed may have been a satellite, and it could have been damaged and trailing debris in the atmosphere, I am uncertain and I have reported the incident as best I could.  With two possible conclusions.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.  PD))<n>

It sounded muffled and steady. I ignored it though it sounded odd.  The sound continued and what was strange is that it the sound was steady.  It seemed to call my attention.  I continued to ignore it.  About 5 minutes later I decided to go to my window, pull the curtains and look.  What I saw was a black round craft hovering between my house and my neighbours&#39; house.  I could see the craft clearly.  It seemed to be hovering right above the roofline of the two houses.  From my perspective I could see the bottom of the craft,  which had 3 distinct bright yet muted lights shaped in a triangle formation.  As I continued to look at the craft,  it moved over the roof and left my view.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have since seen the exact same vehicle in a stephenville picture.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous;  provides no contact information.

Friday the 18th I was driving home from skiing and was about a mile from my house when I spotted a white light in the sky.  I followed it for a few minutes and then headed home.  When I arrived home I noticed the light was exactly like a spotlight, but there was no beam coming from the ground, and this light was going in a perfect circle.  After arriving home, I called my dad out to take a look and he was bewildered as well.  It was a bright white light in the sky moving in a perfect circular motion moving towards us.  I might add we live a few miles away from Willow Grove Air Base, but this was not in that direction.  You could also not see the beam, which is very peculair because on such a cloudy night it would have been visible.  It was as if this light was coming from above the clouds shining down.  It lasted for about 20 minutes that I saw and then disappeared a little after midnight.  I kept looking until about 1:00 AM to see if it came back and it never did.  I really don&#39;t know what to make of it.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The sky was dark black, with normal stars appearing as stationary, pure white twinkles, but then this ball was a circular mass infused as a bright white/blue light encircling it. I gasped, and tried to focus my eyes on it, but we were walking in the middle of a park at the time and before I could see more, tall trees obscured my vision and there was nothing in that spot in the sky when I got around the trees. My boyfriend saw nothing, he was looking at the ground.  It&#39;s just, the size of the ball really scared me because compared to the stars in the sky it was just so abnormally huge. Like if the stars, from where I stood, look like specks of dust, this looked like a softball. It seemed like it was traveling down, falling or just zooming downward toward the left of where I was facing. The size of this blur terrified me because it just seemed so out of place in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

1/18/08 23:00|Graham|WA|Triangle|one minute|Small triangle craft with lights observed hovering above tree top outside of home.|2/14/08|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/061/S61216.html|191|ndxe200801| Small triangle craft with lights observed hovering above tree top outside of home.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This was an account given to me this evening by my daughter as we were at a restaurant eating dinner. She has no interest in UFO&#39;s and is a typical 13 year old liking shopping and Hannah Montana. I am a pure skeptic myself but she rarely is untruthful and I can always tell.  In my opinion she was not lying nor would she have a reason to be untruthful.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Here is what I can remember from our conversation. She was in bed last weekend which would be around the 20th of January I guess and it was around 11 PM at night. She heard a large gush of wind and looked out her bedroom window. She then witnessed a triangular shaped craft hovering just above a tree in the front of her house. She said it was &#34;five feet&#34; away but from her description it was more then likely about twenty feet away from her window. It apparently made no noise other then the initial gushing from its decent.<n> <n><n> <n><n> She drew a picture of it on her napkin and it is a standard triangle with little lights making the triangle form on the bottom and one larger light in the center of it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I asked her why she did not go get her mom or grab her camera but she stated &#34;I couldn&#39;t take my eyes off of it. It kind of made me stay there.&#34; Which I take is that it mesmerized her in some way.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I said she knows nothing about UFO&#39;s but I have seen a few programs on the History channel discussing the triangle craft sightings so I got pretty interested as it was a near perfect description of the footage seen on those shows. I asked her how big it was and she tried describing the size. The best I can come up with is an estimate and it was not very big. Maybe twenty feet long and able to hold two people max.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I asked her what it was doing and she stated it was hovering over the tree top. She said she blinked her eyes and it was gone &#34;disappeared.&#34;  This event occurred in Graham WA in the area between Highway 7 and Meridian St which is still rural and heavily wooded. It is funny because just a few weeks ago, in our local paper, they had an article on Dennis Kucinich UFO sighting and they said it occurred at Shirley McClain&#39;s home in... Graham WA.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Again, I do not believe in aliens and personally I think this is the next &#34;stealth&#34; fighter of its age and will be unveiled soon. For decades people reported the Stealth as an alien spacecraft until it lost its top secret status. The same thing will happen for the triangle crafts and I cannot wait as this technology is astounding.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This account does not end here either and this is where I started to wonder if she was making this all up. She said she saw the craft again the next night! She had a sleep over at her friends (they live four miles away) so that would make the first account happening last Friday for the record. So on Saturday they get into her friends parents hot tub outside and she sees the craft again off in the distance about one hundred yards away. Her friends who thought she was crazy before saw it to and it simply descended from the top of the trees downward toward the ground and out of sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This account was given to me two hours ago by my daughter and is accurate. I believe she saw the craft both instances and that McChord airforce base, which is near by, is performing tests on the triangle aircraft in Graham, Washington as we speak.<n> <n><n> <n><n> If you need more info or need me to speak with her again for more detail let me know as this is all I have.<n>

I could not get a good judge of its altitude but the object appeared to be quite large, had no lights and made no sound.  It was not a cloud. As it moved away from the moon, it grew dimmer.  I ran back in the door to get my wife. By the time I stepped back out, it was no longer visible.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

1/18/08 19:45|Red Lion|PA|Circle|15 minutes|The objects, one in a very luminous gold color and the others in a silvery color moved very fast and randomly from a starry dust.|1/21/08|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/060/S60976.html|199|ndxe200801| The objects, one in a very luminous gold color and the others in a silvery color moved very fast and randomly from a starry dust.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Approximately 7:45pm on Friday, January 18, 2008 I was heading towards my residence on Pleasant Grove Road/Intersect Route 74 and noticed strange activity in the sky.  There was a large bight star-like object to my north and out of the corner of my eye to my east there was what appeared to be a shooting star, but not your every day shooting star it caught my eye about 30 seconds later there was an explosion of star-like dust in the east where this star-like object fell.  I turned my attention towards the bright glowing light to my north and it was no longer heading away from me, it was moving towards the east towards the explosion of star-like dust.  As this bright object was approaching the east I notice two objects shoot out from the east where the starry dust came from.  One of the objects headed towards the far east traveling south and the other headed towards the object that was flying in from the north east.  The large starry like object started to lose its brightness.  Again, another star-like object fell from the sky in the same area where the first star-like object fell.  There were other planes in the area that had flashing red and blue lights and I knew for a fact that it was not a plane or commercial plane messing around in this area at this particular time.  I sat in my car and notified the York County Police of this incident.  There was nothing they could do so they gave me a number to call to report this matter.  After 15 minutes all three objects were out of sight.  I proceeded up my driveway to the west and noticed yet another occurrence happening as I reached the hilltop.  There were 3 tiny objects, silver in color bouncing off of each other in the random direction but in a closed radius.  I did not look behind me to see where the other objects were located and if they were a part of the same similar occurrence.  All three object disappeared in a cloud of sparkling dust.  No falling like stars were sighted when I saw this going on.  I continued to my house so I could ty! pe this statement up as fast as I could.  I received a call from a male correspondent from the number I was given by the police department.  He asked me to call my neighbors to see if they saw anything--I told him that I came home and told my mother only to have to look at me like I was a fool.  There was no way I was going to call my neighbors and have them think I was crazy too.  I did not have a camera or a video recorder on my person at the time of the sighting so it is my word that has to be taken in to consideration.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is not the first time there has been activity in the same area as I saw earlier tonight.  It was around 1994 around February/March when I first had a sighting and I knew exactly what was going on when I saw this incident tonight.  Please take this statement in to consideration.  I am sure I am not the only one who has seen the same things seeing how we live in an enclosed farm area.  Thank you.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
1/18/08 19:40|Madison|CT||10 - 15 seconds|While on Greenhill Road in Madison, Connecticut, coming from Killingworth, Connecticut, at approximately 7:40 P.M. last night, on Frida|1/21/08|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/061/S61001.html|200|ndxe200801| While on Greenhill Road in Madison, Connecticut, coming from Killingworth, Connecticut, at approximately 7:40 P.M. last night, on Friday, January 18, 2008, I saw a round light fall from the sky.  The light was not colored.  It did not blink or make any noise.<n> <n><n> <n><n> If the sun were a basketball, this object was the size of a baseball.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My first thought was the object was a shooting star.  But the sky was dark last night. And, I honestly do not know what a shooting star is.  My second thought was that I saw a meteor or some debris from an airplane Then, as I watched the trajectory of the object, the object moved northward, toward North Madison. I watched this object move for about ten to fifteen seconds. What bothered me was that the object did not fall straight downward.    The arc created was at least 1000 arms in length – perhaps even some several thousand arms in length.  (I am a terrible judge of distance).<n> <n><n> <n><n> I pulled my car over to the side of the road and waited for a crash:  the object just disappeared out of my sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I’ve never seen anything like it.   The object was not an airplane or helicopter.  It was moving way too fast to be either.  Nor was the light source originating from the ground:  there was no light beneath it.  More specifically, if someone had beamed a flashlight or advertising light into the air, there would have been traces of light underneath this beam.  There were none.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I probably would have just shrugged the entire incident off as being a shooting star or meteor – and it’s entirely possible that’s what I saw.  However, when I turned on the TV at 9:00 PM EST, to the Larry King Live episode regarding the sightings in Texas, I figured at a minimum, I needed to report this.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Because of the speed, it would be arguable the light was an aircraft crashing toward the sky.  Because we were driving we were not able to hear any sound.  The object was visible for approximately 1 to 2 seconds, then had passed the horizon.  Estimated speed would be 3000 - 5000 MPH.  Unable to determine elevation.  Did not see shape of object, only the light.  This is a rural area and where I live, there are few streetlights.  I see airplanes flying overhead on a regular basis.  I have also seen hundreds of &#39;shooting stars&#39;.  This was neither.  It did not have any flashing or blinking lights like an airplane would have, and it did not have a tail like a meteor.  The light was also more yellow than a meteor.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I think it is just a plane then it is just keeps on going. Then I get up and look at it and the lights were so bright I could see the shape and it was circler and the lights were brighter then the moon, and I was thinking airplanes lights can&#39;t be that big so I got up and told my family, they thought I was kidding and made fun of me. But then I looked at it and saw the shape and the lights. I knew it was an U.F.O<n>

I saw a very bright light first assumed it was a plane that had just turned so as its main light became visible suddenly to my location but thought it was taking an odd path away from either hbg airport..also noticed it seemed to be going going down and appeared to be accelerating. It then was obviously moving very fast....from my vantage point it  seemed like an oblique east to south south west rapidly descending trajectory. Assumed it was a meteorite... could not find any other reports of this.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

In the SouthEast, I looked up at the moon.  The moon was to the right of the object, about two &#34;hands&#34; away.  I saw what at first appeared to be a satellite moving toward the south.  It moved for a few seconds, and then I could make out something directly behind it that was dimmer and seemed to be attached to it.  I am an amatuer astronomer, and have spent many nights watching satellites passing by.  What piqued my curiosity was that this object made a complete turn, and after a few seconds made a u-turn in the opposite direction.  The more I watched it, I was able to make out some detail, even though it was a small white-blue point of light with something attached to its rear.  For a second it seemed that there were four or five much smaller white lights surrounding it as well.  Then I lost sight of it because there was a few whisps of clouds that eventually obscured it.  Time interval was roughly one minute.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I had not heard the news reports of local UFO sightings yet, so I hadn’t suspected anything unusual.  But when I saw it go by again, I looked for the source.<n> <n><n> <n><n> To my amazement, there was a gigantic dark shape higher than an airplane and about ten times larger.  It was much longer than it was wide, had a pointed head and very unusual indents and I don’t know where the light was emanating from on the craft.  It did not have wings like an airplane.  The clouds covered the vehicle or it sped off before I alerted any more possible witnesses.<n>

DO THE RIGHT THING. Report what u saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Still trying to wrap my brain around this, but here goes:<n> <n><n> <n><n> Firstly, I live in a beautiful location, facing the mountains.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Friend of mine was respecting my rule to open kitchen window to smoke and blow it out, when she started screaming for me to come immediately. It took me all of 2 seconds to reach that window. What we saw was mind blowing. The sky was completely illuminated. You could literally see the tops of all of the trees as well as 3 layers of colors above them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> One  layer  was baby blue, another  was gray , third was almost white. (truthfully can’t report in which order…..sorry) The big or little dipper (not sure) was clearly illuminated in the sky to our left as well as tons of other stars we had been unable to see earlier due to the oncoming storm.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We could not take our eyes off these bright objects!  The large one, was over the little one and had a red lights underneath it. It appeared to be in the shape of an octagon, but it kept darting so quickly that I can’t swear to that. The large shape kept hovering and darting all around the little light and then it just took off, like lightening! It was so quick that I could have sworn I saw a stream behind it, but it could have been my eyes adjusting to that incredibly quick exit. I don’t know. I do know that the little light kept shining and moved sporadically and much slower than the big one. I then brought my 5 year old to the window and asked him what he thought. (He was not privie to anything we had just experienced.) His retort was “Mommy, It looks like an eye and I don’t like it looking at me, can I go back and do my lessons on the computer now? “  I , unlike my pal am exhilarated. She is on the other hand, terrified. Go figure. Who the hell is gonna believe either one of us, eh? Here is the testimony of my terrified friend in her words;  I was smoking out the window when I saw this bright light in the trees out back. It kept going up and down gradually. Next thing I knew it was on top of the tree tops again. I saw an octagon shape at that point. It started going up and down through the trees and that’s when I started paying more attention, When the lights started going up and down faster I admit I freaked and shouted to my friend to come and see this for yourself girl. That’s when I saw the octagon shape with lots of white, green and red lights. We both stared in disbelief. We knew at that moment that we were bonded for life, cause no-one would ever believe what we saw with our own eyes tonight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous;  provides no contact information.

It was shining light from the sun or its own it appeared.  It came from north east headed south then west slowly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After observing it for 5 minutes it appeared to be a disk to long disk shape and I got a feeling whatever it was it was observing me.  I ran to my car to get my binoculars. Then it took off north west.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About 2000 feet or so I guess it would be the altitude of the object. The mountians tops at the mountain it came from is about 4000 feet.  The direction was from NE over the mountains slowly sweeping down heading West then up again over the mountains heading NW then speeding fast.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was gone after it went NW.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The flight patterns here I know from years of watching and that object took a different one.  May be a military flight pattern but disk shape?  It did not make noise.  Even planes at 2000 feet make some noise.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous;  provides no contact information.  PD))<n>
1/17/08 08:00|Half Moon Bay|CA|Changing|3 hours|Orange lights and triangles over field south of Half Moon Bay.|1/21/08|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/061/S61028.html|213|ndxe200801| Orange lights and triangles over field south of Half Moon Bay.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On the day of this incident, a friend and I went to explore a field and empty reservoir in this field. We wanted to come back to it that night, and enjoy the moon and conversation away from town life. We came back with another person that night. We walked to the end of the field for no reason in particular, and noticed 2 orange lights over the trees. They were moving quite slow, sometimes not moving at all. They appeared small, as if they were planes. They would head east away from the ocean. They would circle around and disappear behind the hills. They usually appeared in twos, separated by quite a distance. They would always appear from behind hills or trees. They sometimes appeared from nothingness. They would sometimes turn off the lights, and then appear with light configuration like jet planes. They had up to 7 lights, most commonly 2 headlights with “wing” lights and up to 3 lights in the back. But they were too low and too fast and silent, and were not jet planes. At times we could see up to 6 in the air. We called our friend and he came with his girlfriend. We watched the triangle and squares and diamond crafts fly around, like bees. They would often change path, and were just observing. It seemed that other crafts would appear in the paths of other crafts. We had a flashlight, and when I flashed patterns on the field one turned its headlight toward us and changed course to fly directly above us. They were triangular in shape when we saw them from below. From the sides, they appeared oblong and very large. They appeared very bright, and I do not think jets or prop planes have these bright of headlights. Our observations were mildly disturbing, and 4 of us were convinced they were UFO’s, but the only girl with us was still skeptical. This was about to change. Over a hedgerow cypress forest, 2 lights, dime sized to us only 1,500 feet away, hovered for maybe 2 minutes. There was a faint glowing aura in the trees below. They moved slowly around, and we could see one turn away and he! ad for t he ocean. The other continued closer to us, within 600 feet, following a drainage ditch it seemed like. It hovered to the highway, and looked at the traffic from about 700 feet up. It then went over the hills and disappeared. We could see it with binoculars, and it had a bright halogen like head light, and a green light on the back with a red light above it. On the back were 2 white lights, with a red light underneath each one. It looked like an observer. The red light blinked very faintly. After this one had left, we didn’t see anymore that night. We left to pick up some food.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I could hear no sound from the lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My windows were rolled up, however the military has jets flying over this area very often and if they are low enough to the ground you can hear them with the windows rolled up.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Also, later that day, while traveling with a coworker in his suv truck, I observed a jet flying overhead and noticed how loud it was and how small in comparison it looked to the lights in the sky I observed that morning, and the jet was flying pretty low.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous;  provides no contact information.

I cannot give them a true color as we know it…they were not white and not yellow.  They had a very “warm” hue, yet bright and steady.  There were no blinking lights like in aircraft I’ve seen flying.  The shape was between a triangle &amp; horseshoe.  Not as sharp as a triangle yet more pointed than a horseshoe.  The area is very close to a military base so I am VERY used to aircraft, but what was most odd about this is that it was not the sound that caught my attention - but how inordinately low &amp; how methodically it was flying. There was an odd, methodical  steadiness of the lights and movement.  The other odd thing was once I noticed it, I could then hear a soft (almost muffled) sound. The closest description I can give is that it sounded more like a soft muffled whooshing than the engines of a plane, military plane or helicopter.  In hind-sight when I think of the soft whooshing sound &amp; lights I would almost describe the combination of the two as an “energy“ of some kind.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Needless to say I had a very conscious thought that if I didn’t know better I’d say that is a UFO…..but then low &amp; behold (almost as if it heard me) it literally hovered for just a second (no more than 2) right above this exceptionally large pine tree that stands out above the tree line and hung there in a complete stopped position.  As I started to move further out onto my drive to make sure I was REALLY seeing this “plane” just hovering, it lowered straight down.  No angle to the lowering, just a straight line down at the same methodic speed it had been flying.  Having asked a question or two (while trying not to make anyone think I’m crazy) I have determined there is actually about a 30 acre field within ¼ mile of where it appeared lower straight down.  I stood there for about 4 minutes waiting to see if it would come back up. I went back into the house I immediately told my boyfriend what I just experienced.   Another VERY important note is about 3-4 minutes after I came back into the house I heard an exceptionally LOUD boisterous military aircraft engine fly directly over my home.  I again ran outside to see what was going on &amp; though you could clearly hear the military plane (&amp; the house was vibrating from it) I could not readily see the aircraft.  Now this we’re used to hearing regularly - NEVER so close above the house but it undoubtedly flew directly overhead.  Again in hind-sight I can’t help but think it was following or looking for it.  One other important note I‘d like to make, it was not flying from or towards the military base…if I had to give it a direction it appeared to be flying towards the Hudson River.<n>

It was not moving when I first looked at it. It was hovering pretty low for a &#39;cloud&#39; (as the actual clouds were at a higher altitude) at the corner of my street. It was low enough to feel it could get to me pretty quickly if it needed to! When it actually started moving East the bottom part was trailing in the opposite direction that the object was going and was somewhat conical. The object was white and had a brightness to it like a little light from within but not super bright as I have seen a brighter object in the past, and this object pales in comparison. It was brighter than the actual clouds that it drifted past and appeared to be about the same size as a regular sized (when not too close to earth in it&#39;s orbit) full moon in diameter. So I get a few feet away from the corner and as I am still eyeing what I thought at first was a strange looking cloud. I notice this thing has moved with me, it&#39;s kept pace with me give or take a few steps, as it really began to appear to be following me fairly closely. I was heading for my local coffee shop to get out and get some fresh air and some decaf and instead I get stalked by some mysterious cloud like object! Well I picked up the pace to confirm that it was following and to see if it could keep up and I can walk very fast, so this was a good test! Sure enough it was keeping up with me up until I get to the tunnel/underpass which I had to turn into to get to my destination. So to see if I could lose the object at this opportune moment of quick cover I picked up the pace a little more to get into the tunnel and into my destination without it seeing where I went to. I get to the other side of the tunnel (approx. 40 feet in length) and look up to see nothing hovering anywhere. It would seem like I had lost the object, as I kept watching and I walked approaching my destination. I took one last look before I entered the drive to the local coffee shop and saw no object. It probably only took me 13 minutes to walk to my destination.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So I am in the coffee shop for about 20 to 30 minutes or so and decide it&#39;s time to head back home. While I was in the coffee shop I thought to myself I will walk back home a different way just in case this thing is still hanging around or hiding out somewhere near where I was walking before. So I walk out of the coffee shop and start heading toward the tunnel and there is the object but at a distance not as close as it was before when it followed me. It seemed it was in the part of the sky back near where it started following me near my home but on the opposite side of the highway from where it was originally. It was on the South side of the hIghway when it started following and now it was on the North side but back in the West from where I started walking.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So I walked South in another way to go back home instead of going the quicker way back, the way I came, to see if it would still follow me. For the first little while it did not seem to catch up but then in no time it was right behind me when I was about halfway home taking the side streets in a western direction after I had walked a little ways south. Since it seemed determined to follow me and since it seemed as if it had been waiting for me practically outside my door (thinking it may know exactly where I live, or it will because it&#39;s following me home now) I might as well slow down my pace to make sure it follows me home and I don&#39;t lose it temporarily again . I decided that because I would like to try and snap a couple of quick pictures of the &#39;stalker&#39; if I got back intact and inside to get my camera, but to no avail! As I felt a little threatened by it following me home I warned whatever it was that I was protected so don&#39;t mess with me. I also had the thought in my mind that as soon as I get to my door I&#39;m going to race inside and get my camera, beca use someone needs to see this! Seconds after this about three quarters of the way home I could no longer see the object, maybe my warning or threat of be caught on camera made it leave or something else did that I could not see!<n>

Just got off work, was walking torwards my car and happened to look up at the sky.  What I saw was 15-20 tiny pin dots in the sky flying around together in a group or cluster.  They seemed to be alluminated by something and were a glowing orange/red color.  They were very high in the sky.  Flying around similar to the way a group of birds would.  But there is no way they were birds because they were too high in the sky to be able to be seen.  I know these objects were extremely high in the sky because an airplane flew over head about 60 seconds after they were gone and it was about the same distance up, (maybe a little lower) and was much larger.  Whatever I saw must have been large in size to be able to be seen at this altitude.  After realizing that I might be a witnessing an UFO, I decided to watch one of the objects flying around.  So I focused on one of them....it did a few zig zags and loops and then completely vanished.  So, I decided to get someone to witness what I was seeing.  I went back into the building and found a colleage of mine, and brought them out to see what I had seen.  When I looked up, there was nothing in the sky.  Absolutely nothing, whatever I had seen was gone.  It did not take me more that 15-20 seconds to find my work colleage.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.  PD))<n>

He saw lights that were hovering over our home.  As he neared the lights (the lights maintained their position and he drove up to them) he began flashing his vehicle lights at the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was two orange lights that appeared to be on a flat triangular body.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As he flashed his lights the object appeared to turn as if to acknowledge seeing him.  He stopped his vehicle once he was in our driveway and ran into the house to get us (his girlfriend, me his mother, and his 16 year old sister).<n> <n><n> <n><n> We all ran outside and the object had moved to above the neighbors field.  We watched it as it moved around in the sky.  Several planes that appeared to be jets came and were circling this object.  A helecopter also came.  The object eventually disappeared but the airplains kept circling the area for some time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When the object was hovering near us, it made no noise at all.  It could back up or fly off at high speeds.  The lights appeared to change all the time as if they were flickering different colors. I am no expert on aircraft but I do not know of any aircraft that can make no noise yet hover and shoot off at high rates of speed.<n>
1/16/08 20:00|Fair Oaks (landings)|IL|||Triangle like object with bright white lights hovered over Old Collinsville Road near power lines and a cornfield.|1/21/08|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/060/S60991.html|226|ndxe200801| Triangle like object with bright white lights hovered over Old Collinsville Road near power lines and a cornfield.<n> <n><n> <n><n> First I need to apologize.  I originally submitted this report without cutting and pasting on Microsoft, so I am resending it.  Also, I have a feeling I accidentally put the year as 2007 instead of 2008.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At approximately 8pm CST on January 16, 2008 I took my dog out for a walk.  It was a relatively clear night, but very cold and no other people were out walking.  We walked to the end of our neighborhood (The Landings at Far Oaks) and stood in an empty lot.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Directly across from our neighborhood is a large cornfield.  The cross street is Old Collinsville Road.  My dog likes this empty lot and while she was sniffing around I glanced up and thought I saw an airplane flying low to the ground.  The plane appeared to behave strangely--- suddenly zooming up and then going low.  I kept watching and then it started coming towards me and I could not believe what I saw!  I am not 100% certain but I think it was gray and had 2 bright white lights in front.  On the side there was a red flashing light that moved alongside the craft.  I think triangle shaped is the best description, but it was dark and I was freaked out and can&#39;t be 100% sure.  Also, it was silent.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I panicked and ran home as it appeared to hover behind me.  While I was running I was too afraid to look back.  There were lots of lights on in several homes and one house seemed to be having a party (5-7 cars parked on the street).  However, I don&#39;t know these people and was too embarrassed to knock on the door about a UFO.  I also did not know who to call.  Maybe I should have called the police.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I then watched the UFO from my driveway.  It continued to go high and low and I couldn&#39;t find binoculars and didn&#39;t have a camera.  However, within about 30 minutes there were several airplanes in the sky and a large, dark black, very loud craft that I suspect was a military helicopter.  This craft was definetly chasing the UFO and stayed in the area back tracking for at least 40 minutes.  There were 2 small planes from a distance that seemed to be flying too close together, but I&#39;m pretty sure they were small personal aircraft and probably were looking for the UFO.  There seemed to be an unusual number of airplanes in the sky on that night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I lost sight of the object because I was too afraid to get in my car and follow it.  Today, I very much regret that I did not do exactly that, but I was alone and don&#39;t know my neighbors.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I wish that my name does not appear on the internet.  However, if you want to ask me any additional questions please feel free to call me on my cell phone listed above.  Although I&#39;m not sure if I would be able to  provide any more relevant information.  Today I am really wondering if  anyone else witnessed this event.  I will call this into the hotline today (1-19-08) or tomorrow as I am going on a short trip out of stae.<n> <n><n> <n><n> For the record, I have always believed in the existence of UFO&#39;s.<n> <n><n> <n><n> However, I NEVER expected to see one up close!!  I don&#39;t read about UFOs orwatch tv specials about them.  However, I did watch a special calledUFO in Illinois on the Travel Channel about 6 months - 1 year ago.  I was just flipping the channel and the show caught my attention because I had just moved here from out of stae.  The show was a detailed account over several hours about a flying object that police chased for several hours in the surrounding communities where I live.  I now wonder how many UFO sightings occur in the St. Louis area.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It seemed like seconds passed when three craft came through opening the clouds zig zagging towards the area i was standing in.The ships stopped and lined up and waited, and two more ships came straight down and aligned themselves with the first three. They were triangular and black with orange light behind them, they were right above the trees close enough for me to see the shape, the color and lines that looked like how the ships were built.I&#39;m positive they werent stealth planes because they don&#39;t stop in the air on a dime and they don&#39;t zig zag left to right. Also the ships made no sound and no vibration even though they were dangerously close. the ships turned to the south and slowly moved away over the trees.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

The sky was clear and it was sunny. I was looking forward when a very large object caught my eye in the sky. It appeared to move very quickly and it was much larger than any aircraft that I have ever seen. It was totally quiet, and although the sky was clear and the object was flying low, it appeared and disappeared from site several times. I watched it move very quickly Westbound toward New York City. There was a white streak that appeared and disappeared with the object. When I saw the object, I immediately called my brother and asked him to check the news for “breaking news” that someone else may have seen this object.  I did not want to report the object for fear of embarrassment, however, when I watched the evening news tonight, I now know that other people have sighted the same type of object in other parts of the country.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

As I walked, I looked up at the clouds to determine if it would rain soon. Among the clouds I noticed what looked like a circular platform. There might have been a rail at the top, but I can&#39;t say for certain.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There were no sounds and the platform did not seem to move. It appeared to be stationary.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Size of the platform is also indeterminate as I could not tell how far away it was. The platform was not directly overhead, but it was not low on the horizon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was talking on the phone when I noticed the platform and it remained in sight for at least a minute or two. I stopped to tie my shoe laces and when I looked up, the platform disappeared. It could be that the platform was lost in the clouds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I could not make anything out on the platform, other than it was a circular shape, very much like a platform or a stage.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

As i kept driving along, the lights became very bright and were blinking and the object seemed to take up one whole quadrant of the sky. Upon reaching my work , i watched the object from the parking lot.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The best explanation i can give is that it looked like a costellation was moving in an easterly direction while flashing its lights all the time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I thought it could be a formation of at least a dozen or more planes or helicopters, but there was no sound, the lights were too bright and it moved to uniformly. there is a national guard air base nearby but i have lived here for 35 years and never seen anythig like this.

We were having casual conversation and then out of the corner of my eye I saw a bright light in the sky moving very fast then suddenly the sky went completely black.  At the same time we both gasped.  I did not get as good a look at it  as my boyfriend did.  He saw two bright white lights next to each other (like this -----&gt; * *  ) flying very low (no flashing no blinking), and faster then we have ever seen any thing move.  Then instantly it was gone.  It looked like it flew into a black piece of felt and there was no trace of light anywhere it was just gone.  We were the only car on the road at that time and all of the street lights on the highway were out which we thought was quite odd.  Additionally we were well past Long beach airport and quite a ways from the orange county airport so we don&#39;t believe it was a plane.  Any insight into this sighting would be appreciated Thanks!<n>

Then about 30 seconds later I noticed two more lights above the other two lights. And about every 30 seconds the lower two lights would start to dim out and two new lights would appear above the two old top lights lights. At one given time there were 6 orange lights present. The lights seemed to stay in the same formation except for the fact that it would move up. Through a spotting scope you can see the shape of an object from the glare of the lights. They exited the sky with each light slowly dimming until they were all gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The craft was on the ground @ 1/4 to 1/2 mile east of I29 putting on a light show! In any case, we have never told anyone about it, partly because we did not see it flying, but more so that we could not really describe the shape .... in this Filers files  is a report fron Baton Rouge LA, and the decription is perfect! It was a saucer shape but made of rectangle shaped panels all around the sides flashing bright colors, as they described white, blue, yellow , red and green. While basically round, it had a &#39;jointed&#39; look to it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This was in the winter on a clear, moonlit night, and it had snowed recently, so the colors and craft were highly visible. In this area we have long tree rows which divide fields, and some of them are miles long. The object was sitting on the north side of one of those.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have always had the feeling that it is odd that we did not stop, but it was almost like something was telling us to &#39;move along&#39;.... very strange behavior for me. But we had a fairly long time to view it as the field it was in was in our direct view for several miles, with no obstructions to the view.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Anyway, just wanted to share that! My wife will be blown away when she reads the report in Filers Files!<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Source indicates that date is approximate.  PD))<n>

I was driving at 35 mph and spotted a large object with a bright white light surrounded by two larger red lights hovering just above the treetops surrounding Estes Drive Elementary School. It was approximately 200-250 ft. in the air.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There is a small airport close by, but this was not a plane. The object was moving extremely slowly in a straight line.  It made no sound, and the lights were steady, and did not blink. As it&#39;s a two lane road and I had traffic approaching and traffic coming up behind me I could not stop or turn around to get a closer look.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I reached the end of Estes Drive, at the corner of Estes and East Franklin (approx 1/4 mile from the sighting) I could see a pair of lights in the Southern sky splitting apart, one went to the left (the East) while the other rose to the Northwest.  The Northwesterly object continued rising and then switched course to the East.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;m providing a google map link to the location of the sighting  http://maps.google.com/maps/ms?ie=UTF8&amp;msa=0&amp;ll=35.941254,-79.044614&amp;spn=0.014662,0.030899&amp;t=h&amp;z=15&amp;om=1&amp;msid=115158618809161062506.000443ccc63531c403d95<n>

The closer the lights came the futher the  lights seem to be apart but attached somehow (as in 1 craft).  As it was more overhead I noted other lights in the shape of a T.  now there were three bright lights at the rear or top of the T equally spaced and four lights in a row out in front of three bright lights. The second light from the front seem to change color from white to reddish, blue, green then back to white for about 2 or 3 seconds and then stayed white.

As I paid closer attention I noticed that it was a perfect circle (it appeared to me) and not only one circle indentation in the ground but several smaller circles inside of it. My father in law brought his big diesel truck in the back yard and did not leave any tracks or impressions that lasted as long as this circular pattern has. It is about 80 to 100 feet across and I have documented it on video because it is so weird how it got there and there are no tracks that leave the pattern. I am not a ufo freak but this is not something that you see every day. I am contacting you guys because  the pattern is still there even after the rain and me cutting the grass over it.

It was cyclical; there for one second followed by 2 seconds of non-noise, then repeated. It faded in quickly and dissipated slowly over about 30 seconds. Whatever it was sounded as though it passed quite close to the house. There were no reverberations observed but they may have been masked by sound inside the house. Also curiously, no Doppler shift was heard, although the sound seemed to muffle as it faded out.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have never heard a sound like this outside of a recording studio before.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Only thing I could think of was it sounded like a jet engine low on fuel and cutting out and in, but there were no normal airplane noises associated with it.

I noticed something that looked like silver sphere hovering in the air to my left, which would be southwest from my location, and I tracked it from my 11 o’clock position to about my 7 o’clock position as I drove in the number one (fast lane) at about 75 mph.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There were no visible rotors, blades or cockpit. It looked solid to me and it was a good distance (1 mile?) away with a good amount of height (300 -500 feet?). I originally estimated its size at about half that of a VW Beetle, but I later changed my mind after comparing the size of the old Norton water tower, which is plainly recognizable as a very large water tower in the distance. I now think the sphere was larger – maybe 10 feet in diameter.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object caught my attention because it hovered in the sky much higher than a streetlight or radio antenna and did not look like a helicopter, airplane or balloon. In my opinion, the object had no visible means of propulsion (blades/ intake) and no visible cockpit. It was not an obstruction caused by moving traffic or other nearby obstructions. It was in the distance and initially not moving. To me, this is an odd phenomenon, especially on a clear day. As I observed, I watched it maneuver upwards in a reverse “J” – it must have gained in elevation about one or two hundred feet in less than a second.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It then stopped or slowed dramatically at the peak of its ascent and moved to the right a bit.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I looked at the object for about three seconds before I lost visual contact due to moving traffic. I could no longer “spot” it because it was now behind me to my left. I looked at a map of San Bernardino and it looked as if it was in the direction of the old Norton Air Force Base (San Bernardino International Airport). I had to take my eyes off the object because I almost drove off the freeway.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At the moment of this observance, I was in the number one (far left) lane with no obstructions from westward traffic or streetlights. My car was clean with no spots on the windshield, there was no glare from the sun and I was sober and alert. The entire event (while short) caused me enough stress to almost crash my car and I immediately called my family and friends to tell them what I saw. I don’t think it was a weather balloon because of the extremely fast movements (stop-maneuver-stop). I don’t know what it was; it was an unidentified flying object. I noticed a change in color from silver or grey to dark grey or black - this was in my opinion caused by the object&#39;s shadow, but I&#39;m not 100% sure.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am a 32-year-old married white male that has experience in practical special effects for film and television, I have 20/15-eyesight with no physical impairments and I am an avid outdoorsman. I am also a local to San Bernardino County and I have driven the 30 freeway hundreds of times in all conditions.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I did something on the spur of the moment and flashed my Jeeps Headlights on and off several times, What happened next is very odd for this place, and something I&#39;ve never seen before on any aircraft. Those sixteen lights that were shining straight down were nt strobing at all,then the instant I flashed my lights at him ALL SIXTEEN LIGHTS TURNED BRIGHT RED FLASHED ON AND OFF THE SAME AS ME THEN REMAINED RED!! true I know It&#39;s not a Travis Walton Story,but, It&#39;s Mine and It&#39;s True they were&#39;nt trying to hide at all.

We were counting them (we counted eight of them) when my son said, &#34;Look at that airplane!&#34;  To my left up in the sky there was what looked like a white ball traveling at an alarming speed.  There also appeared to be either a flashing white light on this object.  I watched it for about 20 seconds, then it disappeared behind a cloud, came back out the other side, and I watched it for at least another minute.  Even my 6-year-old said, &#34;Mommy, that doesn&#39;t look like an airplane.&#34;  At approximately 8:05 AM, almost 20 minutes after we spotted this object, we heard a news report on the radio that some people in Texas had seen what they thought was a UFO, but that federal officials are reporting that it was an &#34;aircraft in the sun.&#34;<n>

After six am, I noticed a light in the sky just a little north of the highway but off in the east.  I looked at it for a bit and decided that it was probably a star- but it just didn’t seem like the right place for one- not too mention I didn’t see any other stars.  So, I just watched it as I traveled east.  As I headed east, I went onto the Basin Bridge, also known as the Atchafalaya Swamp Freeway.  Light began to break and I watched the light, I had also thought maybe it was an airplane, but it had no Navigational Lights and it should have passed me by now.  At about 6:40 am, I was nearing the end of the bridge about the 134 mile marker and there was more light out side, when I could see that it was cloudy above this “light”, in fact it was very cloudy with the high altitude clouds.  And this light was actually not all that far up in the air…  It was stationary and I watched it until I was under it, I moved the truck onto the shoulder and I could not see it anymore, I looked in the mirror and I still could not see it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The area that it was over, is also the same area where the Natural Gas Pipe blew up in December. (I think that’s the right month.)  This is at mile marker 135 on the I-10.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I called this into the hotline just after I lost it…within a very few minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This one bright white light-looked like a star.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I looked to the East, where I have seen objects appear in the past, and I saw a light that was not a light in the usual constellation patterns. I look at the sky in this direction every time I take my dog outside, so I know right away if a light is appearing in a spot where there is normally not a light/star.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It moved around a bit, and then grew very bright, like a car headlight coming at me, and was very large, then dimmed to the brightness of a star, and then repeated the sequence again at least 3 or 4 times, while hovering and moving about slowly in random directions. It looked to be about at the height that a helicopter flies, but it definitely was not moving the way I have seen helicopters maneuver. It was about 4 miles away from where I was.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was in the US Army for 6 ½ years, so I have seen quite a few varieties of aircraft, and know when something is moving in the sky, in a non-traditional aircraft way.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Off to the right (South) of that light, there was a smaller object, which had a small white light in the center, and a ring of flashing colored lights across the center of the object. The flashing lights were mostly blue and red. This smaller object moved around in random directions more than the larger object did.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I watched it for about 20 minutes and then went back into the house.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

1/15/08 03:30|Quad  cities (near; over I-88)|IL|Unknown|10 minutes|The Craft had several brigth colored ligths, appear to be large, disappeared when it flew straight up, it's lights faded off|1/21/08|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/060/S60845.html|255|ndxe200801| The Craft had several brigth colored ligths, appear to be large, disappeared when it flew straight up, it&#39;s lights faded off<n> <n><n> <n><n> On January 15th 2008 at approximately 3:30 AM near the 30mile marker of I-88 in Illinois, I noticed a bright light directly ahead while driving East bound from Iowa. At first I thought it was some sort of plane, perhaps a small aircraft flying straight towards my direction.  After a couple of minutes I noticed that the object appeared to be larger and brighter, at this point I realized that the craft’s lights seemed odd since none  appeared to be what I’ve come to recognize as conventional aircraft strobe lights. The lights did change either color or brightness, I’m not certain which, it may have been doing both. However, they did not appear to be those of an airplane and I  then thought it may be a helicopter, but did  think it would be odd to see one near this location at just over 3:30 am.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I continued driving towards it I fixated on the object since it appeared to remain stationary over I-88, and I didn’t seemed to be getting any closer to it. It did appeared to be increasing and decreasing in size from time to time, it also became brighter and seemed more colorful.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After what might have been 5 minutes I noticed that the objected moved in a semi-circular fashion. It appeared to have flown away in an upwards direction and then circle back towards my direction while remaining higher in the sky than it had previously been.  It moved in this manner a couple of times and was very easy to keep track of since the sky was absolutely clear.   In this stretch of high-way there aren’t many lights and the moon was no longer present. The sky was absolutely dark except for all the bright stars and the craft that was flying/hovering around.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A moment later the craft was almost directly over my vehicle, at this point I came to almost a complete stop, pulled onto the shoulder and rolled my window down to get a better look at the object.  I became a bit anxious at this point since I still did not recognize this flying object, and it seemed to be moving in a fashion that it just doesn’t seem to fit any conventional aircraft that I’m familiar with.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I was looking almost directly up at the object, I could clearly see several lights that appeared to be located under a solid structure. The lights were different colors and I believe some seemed to be located around or near the edge of the object while other lights seemed to be fixated directly under the object.  It remained in this position for a few seconds, perhaps 10, and then appeared to ascend straight up. I assumed it ascended because it became smaller. Then all the lights appeared to have faded at the same time and then the object simply disappeared into a completely clear sky. I did not loose sight of it because it increased it’s altitude to the point where I lost sight of it and it did not fly off in another direction, or through a cloud, even though it pretty much appeared to have done just that . It simply dimmed quickly and vanished. Again, there were no clouds present what so ever and I was able to see stars in the exact spot of the sky the object had just occupied. Soon after I saw a couple of aircraft circling the area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> For the last three years I have driven this road nightly five to six times a week from Chicago Illinois to Iowa City and back. I have never seen anything remotely resembling this object, and while I have seen occasional small aircraft from time to time, none have ever behaved anywhere near this manner. I’m also able to recognize how planes of all sorts generally appear in the night sky because first of all I attended flight school for 2 years at Lewis University in Romeoville Illinois, and I later worked at Chicago’s O’Hare International Airport for ten years. I actually worked as the Night Hotel Manager at the Hilton Chicago O’Hare located directly in the middle of the airport itself. It’s a ten floor building. It’s the tallest structure except for the control tower. I mentioned this because I routinely spent my break on the roof of the hotel seeing aircraft land, take off, and fly holding patterns a countless amount of times. I also lived only ten minutes away from the airport itself.  So I’m very familiar with how aircraft look and fly and generally behave in the night sky and I’m convinced that what I witnessed on this Tuesday morning of January 2008 was not a conventional aircraft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There were other vehicles in the area, not many, but I’m sure others saw this object as well.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Please let me know, via e-mail, if you are aware of any other reports regarding this incident  Thank You,<n>

As I was watching TV out of the corner of my window this big bright light caught my eye.  This light was moving very fast across my window.  It had three big bright lights in a triangle shape.  Two at the bottom facing the ground and one facing the sky.  I have watched planes go across this window every night.  This object was flying the opposite way of these airplanes and a very high speed.  From my view the object looked like it was a couple hundred feet off the ground and moving downward.  I have never seen such a bright object cross that window before.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

We were passing through Sugarcreek on our way to Bellbrook (my home town) when we saw the strangest aircraft in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was large, black and triangular with one white light on each point.  It seemed to be hovering nearby.  It made an odd humming noise and was able to move very slowly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We pulled over to watch it and two others appeared in the distance, moving incredibly fast and moving in ways that you would not expect of an aircraft.  In fact, their movements struck me as being completely unnatural.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Even now I cannot conceive of how anything man-made could move in such a way. I looked at the clock. It said 1:40 am.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was no mechanical interference and we didn’t lose time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My Boyfriend and I have always been fascinated by stories of encounters with UFO’s though neither of us had ever seen one before that night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I still see them in that area every now and then, late at night.<n>

Initially we though nothing of it because it looked similar to a helicopter except the lights had an unusual pattern.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The red lights began on the left, moved to the front, and then moved to the right, this was followed by a complete fade of the red light into a very bright green light that encapsulated the entire object, followed by a bright white light.. This pattern of lights continued through the viewing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object moved across the sky until reaching a clearing directly West of us, it hovered for a few minutes and began moving up and down quickly. it continued to move in a horizontal and vertical pattern for about 30 minutes until 5 white lights approachedThere was also a few jets in the air flying around the object, which is unheard of in our area. The object finally began moving upwards and quickly shot up and dissapeared out of sight, moving at a speed I have never seen before and it went from a immobile hovering state to an incredibly fast upward motion. The helicopters immediately left once the object did.<n>

He went and looked through his Zeiss binoculars at the star.  The STAR (or whatever it was), seemed round in shape.  It flashed the colors red, white and green.  I suggested that we compare the star to the other stars around the sky.  There were also at least 7-8 others ones.  Some seemed further away. They were stationary and only moved as the earth rotated. We have looked at the stars at other times using good quality spotting scopes and these were definitely not stars.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

About a minute after I started looking up I saw an orange flash of light right behind the clouds. It was very long and a little wide in the middle. Very similar to a cigar with pointed ends. It shot from west to east across the sky. The color was orange but a dull orange, not bright. That was it. Lasted about a second. I&#39;ve seen meteor showers and &#34;falling stars&#34;. In my opinion this was neither one.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I suddenly saw a bright, white fireball in the sky. I ran to the window and watched it fall for a couple of seconds before it disappeared behind the trees. It was bright white and appeared to be on fire. The moving flames were white hot, however, not orange, yellow, or red. I felt no thud of impact, heard no sounds, nor saw flames of an explosion.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I ran to my car and drove east along our road to check the neighbors’ homes for flames or evidence of a crash site where a small plane may have crashed. I was basically looking for flames. Finding nothing, I hurried home and called 911 to report what I’d seen to the Crow Wing County Sheriff’s office. After discussing it with the dispatcher, I jumped on a snowmobile and looked for signs of an aircraft crash out on the lake ice, finding nothing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A short time later I received a call from the investigator from the sheriff’s office who had just checked Northgate Lane, further to the east. He, too, found nothing, and we concluded that we were looking for a needle in a haystack, and that I might have seen a meteorite.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was only tonight that someone told me there had been other sightings on that same evening in Texas, so for what it’s worth, I am submitting my report.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

The difference is that we (my son, husband, and I) were not very close and could not determine the size, nor did we hear any noise. This object was observed appearing, disappearing, and reappearing several times southeast of I-8 on our way from Yuma to Gila Bend. The object also appeared to emit two or three smaller bright objects, which hovered for a bit and then quickly disappeared. A very strange siting unlike anything we&#39;ve ever seen. A friend of my son&#39;s was driving from Phoenix to Gila Bend to meet us and also saw it.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

At first, I thought it might be Jupiter, but it was in the wrong place and even brighter.  The more I gazed intently, the more it seemed like two very intense lights side by side very high in the sky.  I checked for any movement and found none.  Then, it seemed like a low-intensity red light appeared on it&#39;s right side.  I observed carefully once again to determine if it might be an aircraft (helicopter).  The red glow was NOT blinking, but was constant.  It was cold, so I drove west and continued to observe.  I had to turn left, then right again, a manuver that took approximately 15-20 seconds.  Upon returning to a westerly course I resumed my observation, only to discover that the stationary, intense light in the western sky had disappeared completely!   I stopped and got out of my car in disbelief.  It was completely gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous;  provides no contact information.  PD))<n>

I would say it was from 3000 to 5000 feet up in the sky.  It had no particular shape and was not large, but not small. It did not have any lights.  Without knowing really how high it was, it’s size could not be estimated accurately.  It remained in place for at least 10 minutes.  Others must of seen it who also were driving south on SR 17-92  It was definitely not a plane or helicopter. I had to turn off 17-92 , but returned shortly thereafter and the object was no longer in the sky.<n>

1/14/08 14:15|Pomona|CA|Circle|20 minutes|Strange object high in the sky!|1/21/08|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/060/S60955.html|268|ndxe200801| Strange object high in the sky!<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is the second time that I have seen them the first time, was like this time, but many didn’t believe me because of all the dates it just had to be on April fools day!!! But, I still go with the story, because coming up with a lie is not my thing. Well, this is how it happened, I went to the back of the house because I wanted to play with my little puppies, when I just looked in the sky and started wondering about that day when I saw the UFO. Well, I don’t know how I knew they were there because I saw what looked like a dot!! At first I was like it’s got to be a plane but it stayed still, then it stared moving south, very slow, it seemed very high up! And the acqward thing was that airplanes were passing right at the bottom of it! That’s when I started thinking that it’s got to be a balloon or a bag! And at that moment I called my sisters and my brother because this time I wanted witnesses! They came out side and asked me what’s wrong I said you wont believe it remember what I saw on April Fools it there again! They started searching for it and I told them were it is! Then my sister Virginia saw it and she said, “What is that” I told her you see it? She said yes. Well a couple of minutes later my other sister saw it and my little brother! I was so happy that I had witnesses but that’s when another one appeared. I told them oh my god there’s another one!!! When I saw the other one I got so scared! Because I started thinking maybe we see them. Well the strangest thing was that the were moving at a very slow speed, at first one would be ahead then the other. But then they’d go back and it was just so strange. A couple of minutes past when one of them just took off and headed south and disappeared, but the other on were still there! Just moving slowly.Oh yes and another thing that really creped me out was that one of the object was showing a red light at times and the other one flickered a blue light! That was the weirdest part, it actually creped out my little brother, because how could! it show the light in the middle of the day!!! Well, the saddest part is I didn’t have binoculars to get a better look, especially a camera! But the next time I will be ready, because I really want to know exactly what they look like because it was so high up that I couldn’t take a good look at it! It just looked like a dot, but you could still see it so it means it was probably large. I just hope I can see them again because they leave me with so much amazement and wonders!<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

The object appeared to be about 1/100th or 1/150th the size of the sun. It flew from the point I first noticed the object latterly at approx. 40-degrees (in the skyline),  west to east for 30 seconds. At this time the object flew across the skyline and appeared to fly faster yet while ascending up to the stratosphere from a 90-degree angle straight up at which time it grew to less than the size of a balloon. It took approx. 5 seconds from the 90-degree turn for it to disappear. It was last seen heading NE to NW over the Santa Barbara coastal mountains.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As it crossed closest to my view it appeared bright white to bright gray. It looked to be a skinny triangle with one appendage coming off the top and it appeared to be fluttering and not flying. It resembled a boomer rang, but flying sideways with both points closest to the ground.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 10 to 15 minutes after I saw the object I noticed what appeared to be 2 military fighter jets in the same vicinity.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

At this point the object was white and quite bright I used my binoculars and was able to see two dimmer flashing red lights on the object, at this point the object was traveling North away from me i continued to watch the object and approximently two minutes after heading north it got slightly dimmer (i could still see both the white constant lights and the flashing red lights)this is when the object appeared to split into two different objects, with one veering west-northwest, and the other heading more north but veering East. At this point i lost sight of the objects. There were a couple children and one adult neighbor who i believe may have seen the object. I want to say that this is a VERY BRIEF explanation of what i saw this evening. I would feel much better to be able to physically explain these events. I know what i saw, and i have never seen anything like this before. The object did not appear to change speed, it was not moving fast at all which made observing this object unusual, i tried to photogragh it with my camera in my cellphone, but it was to dark (i still have 1 photo stored in phone) I hope that i can explain this experience to someone who can transcribe it. I believe what i saw, a just don&#39;t know how to write it. I am willing to talk to someone who is willing to do this. I want to follow through with this, I want to KNOW WHAT I SAW.............................THANX<n>

Followed tree top blinking lights for 5 to 10 minutes.|10/31/08|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/066/S66463.html|273|ndxe200801| I-40 westbound between Minefee and Conway, AR.  Followed tree top blinking lights for 5 to 10 minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Use the Google Map at this URL for reference... http://tinyurl.com/conwayarufo  You can use the Google Map &#34;Street View&#34; feature to see the terrain and understand my view that night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was heading east bound on I-40 at about 9PM CST on a clear night with star filled sky.  East of Menifee and west of Conway, AR, (Point A on Google Map) I noticed blinking green and red lights 2 or 3 miles ahead and on the right, just above tree tops.  My first reaction was a new tower had been installed (on a clear night you can see blinking red lights for miles from radio and cellular towers), but within 30 seconds, it was apparent that it wasn&#39;t a tower because it was moving, slowly, but it was moving.  As I got closer, (Point B on Google Map) I slowed down to 20 or 30 mph and rolled my passenger window down.  There was no traffic behind me, but there were a few cars passing on the other side of the interstate going west bound.  As I slowed, the object passed just above tree top some 50 yards south of my position right out my passenger window, approximately between hwy 64 and I-40 just west of what is exit 124 now.  Exit 124 was not open at the time, still under construction.  As low, slow and close as the object was, I could not make out any shape at all.  The only visible parts were 3 lights, alternating between red-green-blue.  The object was moving west, north west at about 20 mph no more than 5 feet above the tree tops.  I could not hear any sound from the object at all.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I accelerated, took exit 125 off of I-40, 1 mile down the interstate, onto hwy 64 heading west (point C and D on Google Map).  I again saw the object north west of my position about 2 miles away still traveling west by north west.  By the time I got back to my position parallel to I40 where I had slowed down (point E on map), a 2 mile round trip, the object had crossed over the interstate and was continuing it&#39;s path right at tree top, slightly faster now.  I would guess the object was traveling at 50mph now on a slightly more north bound path than before.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I traveled west on hwy 64 for another 3 or 4 miles.  The object was still in sight, but was steadily getting further away, mostly increasing distance west but also north.  I was traveling at 65 or 70 on hwy 64 West bound, so the object had to have increased it&#39;s speed to something above that.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I turned off of hwy 64 at Hogan Ln, (point F on map) the object was 3 or 4 miles north west of my position and was still visible, though the line of sight was intermittent.   The object at this point was roughly a mile north of the interstate and 3 or 4 miles west.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Upon reflection, I have to rule out an ultralight craft for 3 reasons.  First, it was an absolutely pitch black night, with no moon at all.  Flying an ultralight at treetop height would have been suicide.  Second, as I passed within 50 yards of the object, with my window directly facing it open, it made no sound.  I&#39;ve been around ultralights enough to know what they sound like and at that distance, I would have clearly heard the motor.  Third, the variety of speed the object was flying at was outside the parameters of an ultralight.  The object was at times traveling at no more than 20mph and at other times well above 70.  When I see ultralights flying around C. Arkansas, they&#39;re typically flying at about 30-40 mph.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I looked at it, noticing that it wasn&#39;t very high up, about 1/4 mile from the ground, about a 1/2 mile away from me, hovering over a field and some trees. From my view&#39;s distance, it was about the size of a small marble. I kept glancing at it, and when I realized that it wasn&#39;t moving I slammed on my brakes. I couldn&#39;t believe how bright it was, and I was so amazed that I exclaimed out loud to myself, lowered my window and checked to see if there were any other cars coming. It was like a huge twinkling floating spotlight. At this point the object changed from being one very bright light into 3 strobing white lights, blinking in turn. When it began to blink, the object silently began to move southwards, parallel to my path, and I started to drive again. It had crossed over in front of me, I was heading down a hill, there were some trees in my view. I kept braking to keep it in sight, suddenly it seemed to be heading more west, then east, then it distinctively was heading west, gaining altitude, and I saw an airplane about to intersect with it. At this point the blinking object was about the same size as the plane, a pinhead, they looked as though they met, but each kept going, and within seconds I lost the object over the trees, as the plane continued east. The plane&#39;s lights weren&#39;t noticeable, and it left a slight trail of exhaust. What had amazed me was that the object initially wasn&#39;t moving, was incredibly bright, and fairly low to the ground, then changed its lights, and moved silently and quickly, appearing to change its direction multiple times. When I first noticed it I knew it wasn&#39;t normal, there are never planes that low to the ground in this rural farm area, and any helicopters I&#39;ve seen out there are noisy and have more to them than lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I was riding a crew boat back to the Galveston Beach docks on January 13, 2008. It was a perfectly sunny day and no clouds where in the sky. The boat was traveling north, northeast  20-30 miles off the coastline. I first saw the object in the eastern skyline while lying down in the sun. At first I thought it was a bird that was flying high up.  But, there were no other birds around and it wasn’t moving. I turned to my friend next to me and said, “Look at how high that bird is man!” His first words were that it wasn’t a bird and he couldn’t tell what it was as well. The object was stationary for a good five minutes, so it being a plane was not possible. I kept looking at it trying to discern what it was.  All of sudden while I was looking straight at it, the object vanished and never reappeared. The object was white and curved at the top and flat on the bottom. Almost like a saucer but, it had a slit going through the side of it halfway.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I have been in the aircraft business for over 25 years, first in the Marine Corps then in the civil world. I am a pilot and I have been around all kinds of aircraft and helicopters. I live just south of a major airport ( DFW ) and I know what modern aircraft look like and I know all the flight patterns for the approach for DFW and the smaller airports in the area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Sunday aprox 11:50 am My daughter 15, her friend 15 and myself where driving North bound on Robinson rd ( cross street polo dr ) when I noticed something that looked like a big black box high in the sky, aprox N&gt;E&gt;  over Dallas. This object was really high in the sky, above the approach that airliners take to DFW or Love field. At first I thought it must be the blimp ready for the Dallas game that day. Upon further inspection while we sat at a red light in my truck it defiantly was a big Black Box shaped thing? I couldn’t make out much detail but it seemed to have what I would call notches like a cube on it. At this time the light turned green and we drove due north, at this time my daughter saw a jetliner on approach to DFW and it was way below the alt of this thing. When we stopped again at the intersection of Robison rd and Westchester it was still there and the plane had traveled quite away and was disappearing from sight. AS we sat at the red light watching this thing it just disappeared?<n>

Distance and height of the object is not known. I thought to myself &#34;thats a really bright start&#34;.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About 30 seconds after noticing the light an aircraft moved in the direction of the light coming from an easterly direction proceeding west at a steady speed (possible proceeding to Manchester Airport). I&#39;m positive it was an aircraft - it had a single white light and a flashing red light on and off every 1 to 2 seconds - and was moving in a steady horizontal dirction going west.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The light faded and then vanished. It did not move east, west, or north. I looked around for other stars in the sky and could only see one or 2 stars so I suspected cloud cover had obscured my view. Its now 5:55 am and the light has not come back.<n>

He was driving, and I was on the passenger side.  I was staring out of the window, because it was dark and I had never seen so many stars at once.  Suddenly one of the &#34;stars&#34; shot vertically straight down and out of my line of sight, almost like a bullet.    Immediately afterward, a second &#34;star&#34;, which was very near the first one, shot to downward and diagonally to the right at about a 30 degree angle.  Both disappeared out of my line of sight, as if past the edge of the Earth.  I told my husband, who used to study astronomy, and I asked him whether comets move like that.  He said no.  I didn&#39;t think about it again until I saw the Larry King Live report on mass sightings, so I thought I&#39;d report it.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I live across the street from the ocean and I was just  sitting there enjoying the beautiful warm evening looking around and up in the sky which I always do. I am always looking up. The object that I seen  looked almost like the number 8 turned sideways but slightly squared at the top and bottom and rounded at the ends. I would estimate that it was about 5,000 ft up and pure, and solid white with no wings, numbers, or markings whatsoever. It was not a plane, helicopter, blimp, or kite, or anything that I have ever seen before. As I was sitting there thinking what the heck was that, along came another one much closer about 2,000 ft. up and on the same path going southeast as the first one. I don’t know what is going on because I’ve seen a few strange things looking out over the ocean in the last year. I have to say that we sure are living in a fast changing, strange world lately!<n>

No sound what-so-ever (due to the apparent distance it resembled a firefly or some type of flying animal with a light emitting from it). But being out just under a mile it must have been large and very fast - faster than any jet or rocket.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It had but one light that I could describe--going by so quickly there was an apparent light trace (faded fast behind it) bright amber in color. A true UFO sighting by any standards - my first.<n>

Then I explored the NUFORC site further and read an account regarding a possibly similar “translucent” craft close by over Pittsburgh reported to have happened during Oct of 2006.  Besides that the whole incident is just bugging me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My daughter, a friend of hers, and I were traveling Pike Street towards the intersection of Rt. 980.  This affords us a view of the sky to the north of town and we can see part of Rt. 79N towards Pittsburgh.  The sky was overcast and a bit monotone with no visible stars.  It wasn’t dark yet.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I slowed to stop for the intersection, a large white light appeared over the traffic light at a fair amount of distance and it just looked like an airplane that was headed straight towards us.  I noticed that there were no smaller lights to either side though and pointed it out to the teens.  They continued to watch it as we made our right turn and came to another stop a short distance away.  I was able to look out the driver side window and saw that the object was getting very close and was about to fly directly overhead.  After it passed over, my daughter pointed out a man and an adolescent girl close in a nearby parking lot pointing at the sky in the direction that the object had been headed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I cannot begin to estimate the height accurately.  The object was under the clouds, not over them.  It was at an altitude that I would associate more with a small aircraft rather than a commercial passenger plane.  I heard no sound but the car windows were closed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The traffic light changed and while I made the turn, my daughter continued to look for the object out of the passenger side window but did not locate it again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When the object got closer before I had to react to the traffic light, I could see it more clearly and could eventually see the bottom of it.   I saw a large white center light surrounded by three smaller red lights within a silvery whitish outline of a triangle.  The outline gave the object an appearance of being “see-through.”  The lights were all rather muted and not exceptionally bright or glaring.  But I am the only one of us three that saw more than one light as it passed overhead.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When we discussed what we saw, the kids said that just a big white light flew over.  But I clearly saw more than that and I know I didn’t hallucinate.  Even a big white alone is rather unusual though.  There were no additional lights normally associated with an airplane and the teens are adamant about that aspect in their descriptions.   My daughter also remarked that it was odd that there were no other lights in the sky anywhere at the time of the sighting.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was about 4:00pm MST. The sun was to my left and starting to set. This portion of I-70 runs from the Southeast to the Northwest (where it jogs north before going into Denver heading West). I noticed a bright light to my front right, (looking through the front windsheild) it was fairly high in the sky. The brightness seemed to me to be from reflecting the sun, it was very bright. I couldn&#39;t dicern a shape. After about 30 seconds or so, it disappeared. I know this isn&#39;t much of a report. I thought I&#39;d report it in case anyone else in the vicinity saw anything similar...<n> <n><n> <n><n>

After doing so I went right into raking up the Yard. While raking the side of my house I noticed an odd bright egg shaped object above the elementary school behind my house. At first I thought nothing of it but after watching the object change altitude and location in the blink of an eye I ran to the front of my house and yelled for my wife to come outside.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My son and his friend came running over to find out why I sounded alarmed. I pointed to the object in the sky. My sons friends mom who had just dropped her son off stopped the car to find out why we were all looking up in the sky. When I pointed to the object she asked in an astonished cracking voice “what is it”.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We stared at the UFO in amazement for what had to be 5 to 7 minutes. During this time the object stayed in the same spot. The UFO then climbed in altitude straight up and out of sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After coming to grips at what we had just witnessed we realized that this UFO had to be very large because it was higher than any aircraft we had ever seen and was still being seen as larger than ten or more houses and as bright as a mirror reflecting the sun.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was not a plane.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was standing outside smoking a cig. There are always planes in flying over and past, going towards the LAX airport. So I looked up just to look at the sky. The stars are out tonight, due to very little cloud cover. So it&#39;s very, very clear tonight. Anyway, I was looking, west towards the ocean at the sky. I saw two planes off in the distances. Then i moved my eye towards the east and then i stopped and notice a bight light, that seemed to shimmer, yet it had no blinking light, like a planes or small jet, nor was it a helicopter. As soon as i saw it, i knew it was different. I thought maybe it&#39;s a balloon, but this had light around it and seemed to coming from it. Yet it had no locked shape or form, sort of round but not. I cannot tell how high it was, but i know it was at least as high as the plane, but it seemed a little higher up. from what i can tell this was not a balloon, nor a plane. It made no sound, not contrail. It moved faster then any plane in the sky, and they’re where at least three planes moving in different directions. It moved much faster then any of them and was across the sky before they where the same distance. I don&#39;t know what else to say, other then it was no plane and i have not ever seen anything like this before. It traveled in a straight line or path and yet the wind is blowing pretty strong here, so i don&#39;t think it was anything like a balloon.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

All of a sudden the two separate flying objects had just become one.  There was no sound, or crash, or any sign of what one would assume to be a catastrophe in the sky.  The new “morphed” aircraft started flying in a straight line across the sky.  I also noticed it was moving more quickly than the average plane.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The sighting took place in Michigan, it was about 40-50 degrees out.

I see planes go over my house all the time as Ontario airport is not to far away and this object was definetly not following any flight pattern..also knowing this as my mom is a pilot that flys in and out of ontario airport. It was to me what looked like a firefly going about 1,000 m.p.h. ALOT faster than a plane for sure. It&#39;s altitude was roughly about 2,000 feet. I have looked in the sky every night since then and have seen NOTHING going the same direction as this object<n>

My wife and I were watching the stars from the lanai (unscreened) and observed a UFO crossing the sky at a very rapid speed, faster than any aircraft manmade.  The object had bright lights, three of them total, one that appeared to be in the middle and one on each side.  The object was moving so rapidly that the lights looked deim.  The object was triangle in shape with rear of the object perturding outward.  The object that one point made a unusal manuever that could not be completed by a manmade aircraft.  At the rate of speed it was traveling to make a sideward movement as it did would have been impossible with our aircrafts.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It came to a stop and just hovered for a while, before it turned around a floated back.  I have no idea what size it could be, mayby like a hot air ballon, but most likely smaller.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

I was outside with my brother playing Frisbee golf while we walked his dog.  As he was explaining the basis of the next hole and I couldn’t pay attention to his words; all I could do was look at the sky.  Normally in the city you’re lucky to see a handful of stars and the only constellation you can ever count on is Orion’s belt.  Tonight though, outside of my brother’s apartment, I couldn’t help but stare at the sky in amazement.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I don’t know if it was the clear sky or my brother’s neighborhood but the sheer magnitude and number of stars was breathtaking.  As I was scanning the sky I noticed the odd triangular shaped light forms.  They were moving quickly, faster than the planes.  They were so low and clear and as I tried to keep my eyes on them they jetted through the sky and disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The whole time I kept shouting at my brother to look at them but they were moving so fast that he was never able to fix his eyes on them.  The three lights just totally disappeared.  I ran down the block looking for them, but they were gone.  I stayed outside scanning the sky for ten minutes after, looking for the lights or anything that I might have mistaken this spectacle to be.  I can’t think of any other explanation for it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was three triangular light forms, flying in formation.  They hovered for a tiny bit, which is when I spotted them.  Intrigued and confused by what I saw, my eyes followed the shaped as they sped through the sky.  I tried to absorb as much as I could about them before they disappeared.  Each triangular formation was actually composed of smaller lights creating the triangular form.  They moved together perfectly and quickly and I know they weren&#39;t planes because I could see planes moving in the vicinity.  It almost seemed like they were chasing the formation; it was amazing.<n>

We watched for a longer  time and it had green and blue blinking lights too.  It was hovering closely to the backyard and started to go away very quickly and hovered in different circular patterns.  After a while we saw another one of the same things a little bit farther away.  They seemed to be circling the moon but we don&#39;t know for sure.  every time we tried to take a picture it wouldn&#39;t work as if there was a force-field interference.  Even with a telescope, everytime we looked it seemed to disappear.  After about a half hour of hovering around the moon, it shot out a bright, white light beam on the earth.  We thought it could be a helicopter doing a search so we turned on the news but saw nothing.  If it really was the news or cops they should have reported it so we thought for sure it was a  UFO!  We know what we saw tonight and hope you believe us!!!<n>

I assumed it was an airplane that was heading straight towards us because it stayed in the same spot.  Then it suddenly started to move to the right ( the three lights were still visible) across the sky, then it stopped again.  The two outer lights turned off, the middle light stayed where it was for a few seconds the it shot straight up into the clouds, a few seconds after that the clouds lit up like an explosion.  No idea what is was but it was pretty cool to watch.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

There are no neighbors or street lights, so we watched it.  To be brief we watched this light do a variety of movements and break into 2 up to 4 lights then move back into one again.  We went outside to investigate, there was no light.  Walking back into the house, we both suddenly heard a loud, sharp electronic sounding screech which went on for 40 or so seconds.  The sound stopped for 30 seconds then suddenly started on the opposite side of the property 100+ yards away.  This sound bounced back and forth 3-4 times till it stopped.  Our 3 year old daughter says we met the &#34;yellow man&#34; and she talks about &#34;it&#34; often.  We have had 4 other experiences 3 together, just as distinct yet even more detail and more interaction with the subject.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I thought at first it was a helicopter search light, but then there was no sound and it was very quiet and moving too fast to be searching for anything.  It moved like a shooting star, but starting out slow and then accelerating away so fast I didn&#39;t see where it ended up, the light vanished.  I couldn&#39;t see or hear anything and my surroundings where quiet.  It wasn’t a plane because it was too low and there were no taillights.  It wasn’t a shoot star because again it was too big and there are never shooting stars in England.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

On January 10, 2008 while walking my dog, I saw the following after I had researched all unusually shaped aircrafts and found absolutely none that looked like what I had seen that evening.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object was a saucer shape with 4 rounded pods protruding from the sides.  It was white, possibly light grey in color.  Under each pod there were alternating dull red/blue lights under each pod.  The craft was approximately 200 feet above the ground, no sound just gliding.  When it came directly over me, there was sort of an emptiness to the environment sort of a black hole if you will.  It hovered over me for a few seconds then came a sound of the engine revving up.  The space craft then picked up speed, travelled approximately 2 miles then disappeared into the air.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After this incident, I looked up the hill where I was and saw a dark figure with a bright blue light that did not reflect light as a traditional flashlight would walking towards me.  My Labrador Retriever kept looking in the direction of this image and wanted to go towards it.  I ran towards my home all the while pulling the dog.  When I came into the house, the dog ran up the stairs and looked out the window and began to bark incessantly with his hair standing on end.  I no longer saw the image.  I did not want to call the police because I thought that they would think I was unstable.  I am writing to you at the prompting of a few friends who believe this will be helpful.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was very windy and the sky was completely overcast with low clouds.  As I drove nearer it was apparent the lights, which looked like white globes, were either stationary or moving very slowly above the highway, and they appeared to move apart as I closed with them.  As I passed beneath them, 6 very dim white lights became visible; four in a diamond shape between the globes (closer to the right globe than the left) and then two placed equally distant trailing west.  Unlike the two bright lights, the light from the smaller six looked indirectly lit, like distant windows appear in the nighttime.  The lights were then blocked from view as we passed beneath them.  My wife was with me but was not in the least interested and paid no attention to either me or the lights. Also, on the drive back to Tecopa I was astonished to find my night vision was restored--the halos I&#39;d become used to seeing around oncoming headlights were gone and I could actually see the road ahead as headlights passed. It only lasted a week or so, but man was that a great thing.  I don&#39;t know for sure that it was associated with whatever it was I saw in the sky, but I do know that my vision immediately after I saw the lights was a whole lot better than before.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I can submit a sketch of the lights&#39; configuration on request, IF I can figure out how to load it into this computer.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I was travelling north on Highway 377. Shorly after starting out north I observed a extremely bright, white light about the size of a motorcycle head light. The flashing light was white and very bright it was moving at the speed of my car just below the treetops. It was about 100 feet from my car and the highway. The flashing light stayed at the same speed as my car. I slowed down to 50MPH and the light slowed down, I sped up to 60MPH and the light stayed even with my car. The light followed me for about seven miles until I got to a clearing and then it raised up directly above my car close enough that it&#39;s light was flashing on the highway in front and sides of my car. I could see the light on the pavement outside my driver&#39;s side window flashing. That occured for about two blocks until I had to turn east on Highway 59. When I made my turn, it raised way up high, still flashing then flew southeast at a very fast rate of speed. After I went four blocks I turned north onto Old Highway 99 and drove 3/4 of a mile to my home.  The display of the milage turned red. I turned my car off in the driveway after the display turned red and then started the car again the display where the milage is was a row eights. I turned my car off and then ran into the house. The next morning I started the car and everything was fine, I took it to have it serviced that morning.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

This sighting seems more convincing than last posting in that the sparkling object has multiple lights, including a blinking series of lights at bottom and left hand side, almost like flashlight strength from helicopter.  The object&#39;s location in sky is right at sea/sky&#39;s horizon due east of Satellite Beach, lower and nearer than past reporting.  The movement of the object is small darts or pendulum like swings to left, right and up.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object is not on the same movement/trajectory up into the sky as was last reported of possible Venus/Mars location.  This object has not ascended but has rather remained in a hovering position at same eye level as a cruise ship that would be on the horizon leaving Port Canaveral.  This is clearly not a cruiseliner, but appears to be circular or some sort of patroling device due to the light projectory twinkling like a star and like it is looking intently for something over the ocean.  It is nearer to the surface and to the shoreline than last reporting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The movement is more pronounced as hovering or observing than &#34;ascending into the sky&#34; with Earth&#39;s rotation...it is now 31 minutes into my observation and the object is clearly some sort of craft due to the smaller light on bottom left, and movement resembling that of a darting insect, not a star or planet.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Hope this helps, it&#39;s bizarre, and I&#39;m returning to sleep.  If I wake up again I will submit another update of what I am seeing.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I live near the intercoastal so I always am looking into the sky around this time. However, when I walked outside I stopped at stared at a bright white star in the sky but to low to be a star. Im not sure how long it was there, but when i looked at it, it then shot straight down at light speeds and disappeared in mid air.  There was also a stranger in the parking lot on his cell phone. He hung up and we both said, &#34;What the **** was that?!&#34; We both stared in shock.  The circular white ball formed into two white balls and looked like a division symbol in the sky.  It had one large dot then a line in the middle and then another dot directly behind the other as it shot towards earth.  However, it looked like it would have landed close to the intercoastal waters or around the area where that scientology church is located in clearwater.  This thing went directly down and had no trail whatsoever, so we ruled out a comet. I am young, in great health and have no vision problems and do not follow scientology or science fiction.  This is one of the oddest things ive seen and has inspired me to do some online research like this.. But what was odd was that, whatever it was, it looked like it would have hit somewhere very close to that scientology building.  A few minutes later I heard an odd siren across the waters, they didnt sound like police sirens and were very brief... The hairs on my back and neck stand up when I think about it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous.  PD))<n>

While i was driving I saw a diesel truck parked on the side of the road, i thought that was weird. but in the far distance i saw about 5-7 lights light up in a row and start spinnig slowly to the right.Then all of a sudden they shot off in the same direction (south) and dissapeared. I immediately called my mom whom i just got off the phone talking with and told her what i saw, she thought i was tired from driving and told me it was most likely some airplanes. I was like that was no airplane! Then It happened again, only with fewer lights and I told her what was happening and she wouldnt say a word. i was like hello??Mom,Mom, are you there?? Hellooo?? She was like OMG! Is anyone else driving around you?? And I was thinking these people have got to have seen what I just saw, I mean You couldn&#39;t NOT have seen it.I sped up my driving and was on the phone still and remember seeing some lights and they kept shooting off. The lights would light up in the sky and would linger there for like 2-3 minutes and then slowly spin to the right and the spinning got faster because they shot off pretty fast.

It seemed like a helicopter based on flight speed and altitude (1000 ft or lower)  Then the object appeared to hover motionless above downtown area.  Then, it seemed to be getting very close to my residence after I pulled into my driveway.  I exited my vehicle, and walked out onto the street to get a better view.  The two lights were directly in line with my street (Koch St. in Bloomington)  Then, the object appeared to bank to the right, and I saw 4 lights in a triangle formation.  One light at the front, and 3 across the back.  It made no noise whatsoever, and slowly moved across the sky from west to east.  It then dissappeared behind trees and houses while I was looking at it from my backyard porch.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Her attention was then caught by what looked like a meteor shower in the western sky.  There were several lights that looked like stars blinking and falling.   She called me over to see this and it did appear to us to be a meteor shower although neither of us had ever seen one before.  When I got to the backdoor to look out, we noticed an object to the south that was much more out of the ordinary.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The first thing that caught my eye was how bright the object was.  This object had to be pretty far away, but it was clear to us that it was not a star or meteor.  We soon also ruled out the object being an airplane or helicopter.  This object was hovering in a small circular pattern.  Then the object would shoot to the east and circle around again.  The object would remain in a small area (small from the distance we were seeing it from), but it would hover and shoot to the east, hover and shoot west and so on.  The object moved very fast.  It was very strange.  Neither of us had ever seen anything like it.  The object blinked with lights and when it moved they seemed to disappear briefly and then re-appear. The distance the object moved in such short periods of time was unbelievable.  This went on for about five minutes.  I called my mother who lives about 7 miles away to see if she could see it.  By the time I got her on the phone, the object started flying directly east in a normal straight pattern.  It took off continuing east, but very fast.  Faster than any plane I have ever saw fly.  The erratic patterns the object made and the speed of it lead us to believe it was definitely a UFO.  It sent chills down my spine and my wife was in tears.  She wasn’t scared, just in disbelief of what we were witnessing.  Now we are wondering if the first group of objects we saw may have been connected to this one in some way.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My wife is a biology major working on her Master’s Degree for teaching.  I am a mortgage banker, so neither of us have any knowledge about the stars or UFO’s.  What I can say is that we saw something that was flying, had very bright lights, and speed unlike any aircraft.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The railroad runs directly behind my house. We sat down to take a quick break I looked at some constellations, I began looking for Orion. We got up and lit up a cigarette and started walking along the tracks back toward our neighborhood.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We saw a bright off white light just above the street lights running alongside the tracks. We both said it was probably a street light or a star but it was too big. We kept walking and talking about the day we had only taken a few steps when we both looked up and saw it had moved so we watched it and it kept moving towards the left and up at a sharp angle. It slowed down to a stop then turned completely around 180 degrees on a perfect axis.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It started heading back right then it slowly turned towards us and began to pick up a little speed. It slowly went over our heads and to our right shoulder when we stopped and began watching it. There was not a sound no dogs were barking and the object gave no sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was very low to the ground and we saw reddish white lights that blinked very slowly. This is when we saw the outline of the object it was long but thin it appeared to have a point at the tip with the brightest light on it. it flared out to either side with much smaller red lights. It had three lights (one on each side and one on the tip) and was kind of smooth looking. It gave off no noise if it was a helicopter or a plane we would have been able to hear the sound of the engines because it was so low to the ground.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We began to get very nervous and started walking very quickly trying not to trip and fall. We walked for approximately 15-20 seconds when we looked over our shoulder at it. It had moved a good ways away and we felt like we had to watch it, like something made us want to see it. We watched it go into some clouds that had just formed as it moved away from us. it had been a relatively clear day with low amounts of clouds and those clouds were very thin. It appeared to hover and it was gone. It didn’t fade away as if it was flying away it just disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> No dogs barked the whole way back to my friends hous house, we took a short cut through some peoples yards and most of them have dogs either inside or outside and not one even batted an eyelash at us. When we arrived at his house his dogs didn’t even look up at us. His dogs always bark and try to attack us if anybody walks in his house even if they know who it is. Immediately when we arrived at his house we wrote down everything and drew numerous pictures of the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I ran out and i saw 2 lights. Those lights were much too big to be an air plane or helicopter. They seemed to be the same color as a dimmed street light but in the sky. These lights stood still maybe even hovered. About a minute later other lights appeared forming a Horizontal line. Eventually the lights seemed to be moving in a diagonal manner. They later faded and disappeared into the night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.  PD))<n>

I (age 59) and my adult daughter and her boyfriend witnessed the same 1 mile long UFO, on January 9, 2008. It was about 6.30 pm, and the sky was already dark. I noticed a few aircraft in the sky, and then 2 cluster of lights, one cluster far behind the first one, but in identical path and following at identical speed. Then I realized that, even though the lights were far away, that it was one very large object, since it took up nearly one third of the sky. It wasn&#39;t going very fast, maybe 50 miles per hr. yet, at that height, while maybe only 1000 ft. up, it may have been going faster. It took about 5 minutes to go from the SE to the NW, and that was the precise direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 2. The curious thing is that while I didn&#39;t see any aircraft around it, there was maybe 9 or 10 aircraft in the sky, about 10 minutes later (I had went inside for about that long).<n> <n><n> <n><n> These aircraft were going in various directions, as if searching for the object (as if they could miss it -lol). Then the following day, there was nearly as many jets in the sky, -all producing contrails- and all day long. This was near Okmulgee, Oklahoma.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 3. I didn&#39;t consider reporting this until I saw the news article at the &#34;coast the coast&#34; website, in reference to the West Texas sightings. I had hoped that more Oklahomans would have reported this. I had saw two ufos many years ago, around 1983, at nite, about 30 miles west of Okmulgee. These were similiar to other reported objects, which traveled and then stop at the same time, and then shot off in opposite directions, going extremely fast, leaving long smoke trails. I was a total non-believer until I saw these objects. I haven&#39;t actively sought seeing such objects, and didn&#39;t think I would see another ufo, especially one that was at least 1 mile long. And curiously, though I was in awe of the object, I did not have any fear (though I cannot say the same for my daughter&#39;s boyfriend). I had hear about a very large object being seen by others, while listening to &#34;coast to coast.&#34; As well as the TV report of the large object in Phoenix several years ago. (I had wanted to see such an object, but very much doubted that I would. So this was a major surprise, as well as a wish fulfilled. And while I realize that psychologically, some would say that I subconsiously sought such, the fact that many others in Texas also saw the object confirms that this was not psychologically based. As well as my daughter and her boyfriend seeing such.)  4. And though I have told some people about these 2 incidents, I haven&#39;t had any experiences that have been disturbing. I do not seek to investigate such phenomena. I prefer to think of the ufos as being explainable, viz. part of the earth, or some advanced technology by human geniuses, or natural esoteric realities, such as angels and ghosts. Some relatives have seen the ufos that dance in the nite sky (while vacationing in northern Arizona), though possibly these may be remote controlled objects, or some intelligent phasma. They had not seen any unusual objects until recent years. To be sure, I have been a non-drinker all my life, and have never been &#34;on drugs.&#34; Nor have those relatives done so. Curiously, I would say that only 1 out of every 5 people are willing to talk about such, even after 5 persons have seen such objects, at the same time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Again, I hope there are more reports of this particular object, and detailed descriptions<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

This object was the probably the size of the Superdome or bigger viewing it from that distance.  The object was not trailing debris, and was maintaining level flight (not following the curvature of the earth) through out the sighting. The light was incredibly bright and did not dim as its azmith turned in passing.

It was 4:58, and as I waited I watched an airplane prepare to land as it flew overhead.  I live on a flight path and as I watched the plane at 2,000 feet traveling west, I caught the glimmer of an object much higher up above the landing plane heading east.  The sun was in a position to clearly reflect light from the object.  It looked silver with two cylinders attached.  There was a dark band between the two cylinders.  There was no noise, no vapor trail, and no perturbation of its straight flight path. It traveled from the northwest to southeast at a very high altitude.  Because I was in the shadows and the object was in the sunlight, I had a very good view of it.  I watched the object for a number of seconds and it was gone in less than a minute.  I looked on the web for similar sightings and found a near identical Italian sighting (SanRemo, Italy 9-29-2006, 20:08).<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thus, did anyone see a similar object at approximately the same time?<n>

It produced no noise. However it created a contrail which was approximately five(5)Miles in length and approximately 5ive(5)Miles in width which suggested to the two witnesses that it was not an aircraft of any known type and that it was unusually large. It did not appear to have wing nor engines.

The closest description(from the retired Pilot) is that the leading edge was extremely bright equal to kooking at the sun. it was more flattened in appearance than any other aspect of shape and wa irregular in shape. The mass of the object behind its leading edges was also very bright but  not as bright ad the leading edges.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It appeared to have an entry path of approximately 25Degrees of angle in descent. After it passed over Pikes Peak in an Easterly direction it suddenly changed direction towards the Southeast and its contrail indicated a change of direction toward the Gulf Of Mexico and the it was completely gone from the observers sight. There have been no news reports that the observers are aware of frommany local sources but is likely that  some unit of the Military tracked it via RADAR.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was still quite dark (sunrise that day was at 7:50 a.m.), but it was the first dry morning in some time.  The view at this point in my daily commute is one of the best views I get.  I can see west to the foothills, east to Mt. Hood, and north to Mt. St. Helens on an ultra-clear, summer morning. But on this dark winter morning, I was happy to be able to see the city lights so brightly.  These lights reflecting up at the flat thin clouds gave them a rosy glow. I would estimate the level of the clouds to be about 600’-plus. I base this on the elevation of the road at this point, (topographic map on-line gave elevations between 450’ and 500’) plus about 100-150 ft. of clear skies above me.  The road behind me was clear of cars, so I topped the rise at about 35-40 mph and let the car coast. I immediately notice, just a bit east and above my line-of-sight, four distinct sets of lights grouped in a small amount of airspace, and note that the rest of the skyline is empty. This immediately makes me think “news copters”, and something must be going on near the I-205, which I will cross over in a couple more minutes down the road.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My initial number of four includes a small airplane, furthest on the right, (quickly apparent by motion and lights flashing, gradually moves south out of my view), then two stationary pairs of lights in the middle, and finally, a helicopter, furthest on the left. The helicopter is easily identified by its motion and the main light (plus red and green flashing lights as I get closer).  My assumption is now, “Three News Helicopters” and my thought regarding the two stationary, level “helicopters” is, “Damn, those two guys are GOOD.”  It looked like the helicopter on the left was arcing around, or towards, the two others, at about the same altitude as they were. The movements of the helicopter emphasized to me how dead-set the other two were by comparison. The only distinguishing thing about the stationary lights was that they were round, white lights, set as a pair, side by side. The two objects were level with each other the entire time, and seemed to maintain the same distance from each other. I can only guesstimate: 50-75 yards?  I could perceive no shape behind the lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The road drops down gently but steadily, so even with coasting, I had a clear view of the skyline for a maximum of 9-10 seconds before trees blocked the view.  For the next couple of minutes I really didn’t think of it specifically, knowing that I would see the I-205 up ahead, and maybe figure out what was going on.  By the time I actually came to the overpass and dipped down over the freeway, I was more concerned with something happening on the ground rather than in the sky.  There weren’t any bright lights apparent, but as I came up the hill to the Stop Sign at 65th and Sagert, I did look up into the sky again, knowing I could linger just a bit, since there still weren’t any cars coming up behind me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I really craned my head forward to look up as high as I could, and amazingly, I could make out a hazy pair of lights. But just as I really focused on it, the lights seemed to dim out, and the clouds obscured them completely. So now my thought was, “S#*%!, What timing,… just in time to NOT see it!”  But, just a few seconds later, as I was making my left turn onto Sagert, I figured I’d be able to see the other pair of lights if I looked back over by left shoulder, which I was absolutely right about.  I could just make out the other pair of lights, and once again, just as I focused on it, the lights dimmed out quickly and clouds almost instantly obscured them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Right about now, I think, was when I sensed that things had changed.  As if the first one disappearing into the clouds wasn’t just bad timing after all. And I would have easily let the first one go, if seen only that once.  But seeing the same scenario, repeated just a few seconds later, in a completely different direction, was hard to write off so easily. It now felt purposeful.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I told two people at work that day, and my husband later that night.  I felt compelled to share my experience, but also compelled to make a diligent effort to eliminate obvious explanations. Since this is my normal work route, it was easy to return during daylight hours and take photos of the surrounding area. I parked and took photos from the intersection looking in all directions. I then drove behind the medical buildings and power substation and took more photos toward the intersection.  I could find nothing in the vicinity that is the right shape of light fixture, and/or tall enough to be seen from the initial distance of almost two miles. I also came back with my husband when it was dark enough to distinguish whether there are any other permanent lights in that particular view from the top of the road. There were none we could see.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I would have reported this sooner, but the only person whose opinion I would be interested in hearing on this subject, happened to be on vacation until Monday. He quickly recommended this site as the best place to report what I saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My background includes no special skills or training, but I’ve always been a sky-watcher. I pay attention and take note.  That’s my skill.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Now, what I really want to know is: What did the helicopter and/or airplane pilot see?

As I watched it moove across the sky anouther one became visable and they got close to together. I tried to keep my eyes on both of them as they mooved. I lost sight of the first one and then the second one and that was it. They were UFO&#39;s atleast from my prospective. What did I see? Anyone else report anything like this?<n>

The lights were just above the ground and appeared to be 5 to 6 miles away. At first we thought it was a fire because of the glow beneath it so my step dad who is a police officer called the dispatch to see if any calls have came in about a fire. The dispatcher said none have come in. We knew it wasn’t a fire when the lights came towards the ground and disappeared. Approximately 5 minutes later the light would come back up again into the sky where they would hover for another 15 minutes.  They repeated this process for about an hour. We were positive that they weren’t flares, planes, towers, or helicopters. The largest army Base Fort Hood is north of where our house is and the lights were in that direction.  So we might have thought it was some kind of military operation. We have never seen anything like this and what interested us more were the reports that came in a week later on the news.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The object then started moving at a fairly fast pace (like an aeroplanes speed) from West to east over Cardiff.  As we watched it we discussed what it could be.  It wasn&#39;t a balloon as it was moving to fast, and was traveling along a horizontal plane.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We thought it couldn&#39;t be a plane or something on fire as it it wasn&#39;t losing any height.  We watched the object for about 5 minutes as it disappeared into cloud to the east.

I have been a police officer for 17 yrs, have seen many extraordinary things, but I am still in shock over what my 2 sons and I witnessed. On the 8th of January 2008 at approximately 1920 hrs. I went outside to gather some firewood, looked across my property which sits on a hill facing the northeast, with a view of approximately 8-10 miles. I noticed these extremely bright orange or flame colored lights rising 300-500 feet above the horizon. The lights were horizontally aligned and spanned an area quite wide. I noticed they would disappear for a few seconds and would appear again at different heights as if they were in sporadic rows. The lights would come and go in various numbers ranging from as little as two and as many as 12. I became intrigued with the lights and called my 15 yo son as well as my 18 yo son to come outside and view them. I suggested to my sons that it might possibly be a fire off in the distance, but recanted as the lights progressively reached greater heights. I went as far as calling the Williamson County Sheriffs Office to see if a fire or something of  that  nature had been reported in the area of the lights. This call was documented and a Deputy was sent to check the area around 1941 hrs. We attempted to get photos of the lights but where unable. The lights disappeared shortly after the call to Williamson County S.O.  I would like to re-iterate the size and brightness of the object rivals nothing of man-made proportions, and my 2 sons could somewhat compare the brightness to the oil drilling rigs you see far offshore in the Gulf of Mexico. Thanks for your time and I hope this helps in your investigations.....<n> <n><n> <n><n>

1/8/08 19:00|Stephenville|TX|Oval|10 - 15 minutes|Summary of Radio news coverage for Stephenville, TX sightings 1-8-08.  ((NUFORC Note:  Several reports.  Extensive news coverage.PD))|1/21/08|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/060/S60863.html|347|ndxe200801| Summary of Radio news coverage for Stephenville, TX sightings 1-8-08<n> <n><n> <n><n> Hello Mr Davenport,  I am a former CBS reporter that is living near Dallas, TX, and not too far from Stephenville, TX, where, as you know there was a very dramatic sighting.  (I actually did a report for you a couple of years ago about a sighting I personally had in Amityville, NY that was very clear).<n> <n><n> <n><n> I did not see the incident myself. But I thought you would enjoy a compliation of what has been reported on mainstream media about this since it is getting a lot of coverage from both radio and TV stations in this area.  KRLD radio has had comments about this incident in almost every newscast since the 8th and has reported that they had a flood of calls about it. WBAP has been discussing it also, and there have been several TV News reports (I no longer get tv/ cable service, so I cannot tell you as definitively about that coverage, only what has been on radio and websites.)  I have compiled the following details from the news reports over the last week that were not mentioned in the report on your front page. These notes are taken from several news reports over the last week (1-8-08 until today 1-15-08).  Many talk shows have been encouraging callers to call into their stations. (KRLD news dedicated 2 hours to this topic today – and had several credible witnesses including a pilot and a Constable who witnessed the event.)  Many others, including a fire fighter, and other police officers reported seeing the object (and several others).<n> <n><n> <n><n> Witnesses have been describing the object as being either a dark brown, black or a grey color ranging from a white to dark grey.  It is possible that it may have been changing color, or to have had different colors on different sides of the object because witnesses even in the same location disagreed about the exact colors.<n> <n><n> <n><n> All witnesses agreed that there were orange lights on the object, but reports of white, red and yellow have come out as well.  All reports agreed that the lights were numerous, very bright and flashing or changing.  Several witnesses described something that could have been flames, and one person heard on KRLD said that she believed the object had “dropped” something behind it that appeared to be on fire.  Most witnesses said the lights were moving or changing position  Some reports have said there may have been a smaller second object, but the majority has said one.  The size largest size estimates described the object from ½ mile wide and 1 mile long, the smallest I have heard said “bigger than a football field” It was estimated to be flying at about 300 feet.<n> <n><n> <n><n> All agree that the object was smooth on the outside (no wings, no tail or protrusions of any kind) with a shiny surface, but again the color is in debate – All reports agreed that the object had a somewhat cylinder or oval shape to it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The Joint Reserve Naval Air Base is not far from Ft. Worth which does have significant flight activity, however their first response was that they had no knowledge of any aircraft in the air at that time.  There are some witnesses who spotted military planes in the area after the object had been spotted; some say there were chasing the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The next day there was a statement denying that the military had launched any planes at all.   Monday the naval base reported that this was “probably an illusion created by two commercial planes in proximity” and again denied that they had launched any of their planes in response to this object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There is a small airport just outside of Stephenville, however it is a small private airport which does not have capacity for anything larger than a twin engine plane.  The closest airports that could have ability to land a commercial jet would be Dallas Love Field, 110 miles away from the sighting, or Dallas-Ft. Worth International Airport , 100 miles away, and there are no matching reports of commercial airliners coming close, or flying that low in that area. (Which would be needed to verify the naval base comment that this was an optical illusion)  Witnesses say the object moved very fast, and appeared to disappear and reappear a few minutes later.  Most say it moved in a straight line, came to a stop and remained stationary for a moment, but it accelerated very quickly and turned sharply, or even appeared to be moving in reverse.  Witnesses report hearing noise from the military planes, but no noise from the object itself.<n> <n><n> <n><n> If I may add my opinion: The military claim that this was an illusion is not plausible for several reasons:  Tthe Object is consistently reported as being the wrong shape; there is a very large portion of the witnesses who are pilots or public safety officers of different branches – all of whom would be able to easily recognize a plane’s shape; and it was after sunset and the witnesses are consistently reporting the lighting as being dark.(i.e. the “reflection of light” wouldn’t have happened.  Finally, the object has been consistently reported as being not more than 300 feet above the ground, at that distance it is clearly visible to see the details on any airplane.  KRLD reported they had tried to confirm this with military bases throughout North Texas and even as far as Oklahoma but had not gotten any confirmation of any kind as to this being their air craft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I will also add, that WFAA<n> <n><n> <n><n> http://www.wfaa.com/sharedcontent/dws/wfaa/latestnews/stories/wfaa080114_mo_ufospotting.21892ccb.html<n> <n><n> <n><n> is reporting that there were several sightings over about a week which may be why there is some inconsistency as to the date of the sightings.  I believe that the majority of witnesses are talking about the sighting on the 8th, but that there have been similar objects seen over Stephenville over the last few weeks.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I hope this is helpful to you.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We express our gratitude to the young woman who submitted the information.

Altitude and size difficult to gauge, but closest craft that flew nearly vertical over car was low, possibly 1,500&#39; AGL.  Speed was very slow, but at times seemed to accelerate rapidly.  At least one craft observed appeared to be hovering for several minutes toward the west in the direction of Palm Springs.  At times, the white lights would flash two times with great intensity, then dim down. The Palmn Springs Film Festival is underway, so the thought occurred to me that it was some sort of promotional stunt for a film?!?

At the time we were skiing down mount Alpamis and had just reached th bottom of the mountain when a fellow student pointed out an aircraft which looked like an American stealth plane. After a few seconds we realised the plane was travelling too slowly to be an aircraft as it seemed to be blown by the wind. The object was around 0.5 km away from our position at the time. All the students I was with at the time witnessed this, so did a skiing instructor and a few Italians too. It seemed to be black/dark grey, with no lights and was not shiney. I estimate the object was the size of a small aircraft and was triangular with rounded off edges. The next day our ski instructor was interviewed by the local police who told him it was most probably a kite or baloon, but admitted to him that in the past few monts there had been more than 14 sightings of the same description. It was certainly not a kite as it did not weave around like a normal kite and it waS certainly not a baloon as its altitude did not change and was too big. The objects was at an estimated 400 ft above ground level and left no haze and made no noise, although during the event, a truck behind us was reversing and its sirens were going off.<n>

This morning one of the mangers came out of his corner office overlooking LAX and told me to &#34;come here, quick&#34;. He pointed towards the sky and I could see a small black dot against the clouds. He said I just saw this thing come from about 20 feet over the runway at LAX and ascend to where it is now at about 1000 feet. He said when it was over the runway it was about the size of a large truck because it could be seen in the context of the objects on the ground..<n> <n><n> <n><n> He had binoculars, and when I looked through them I could see what looked like a metalic object that was moving slightly, but hovering at around 1000 feet. It looked like a metal tube at one point, but then appeared to change orientation and at that point it looked like a disk shape with lights around the perimiter. The lights appeared to flash. Then the objust appeared to rotate and lights were shooting out from the midline of the object where they had been in a rotational pattern before. The object hovered there for about 20 minutes, staying just below the cloud level before we lost sight of it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We got pictures and will have those tomorrow.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Note: this is the second time we have seen this, but first time we didn&#39;t have binoculars. Three of us saw it and saw the same thing. This is no joke or b.s.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thanks<n>

1/8/08 07:30|Miami|FL|Flash|5 minutes|Frequent lights in the sky sightings in Miami Florida|2/14/08|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/061/S61269.html|357|ndxe200801| Frequent lights in the sky sightings in Miami Florida<n> <n><n> <n><n> To whom it may concern at NUFORC  I would like to report sightings in the Miami FL. Area from the last week of December 2007 through just recently as yesterday January 27, 2008. This the first time I actually had the guts to talk to someone besides my family about it. The first time me and my friend saw a bright steady light in the night sky we kind of freaked out sense we first thought it was a plain flying higher than usual but then it disappeared right in front of our eyes, we had our doubts, and a bit skeptical but intrigued at what we saw! On the first two weeks between the 6 and 8  of January 2008, we saw the many flashing lights not in a formation like military jets, besides the speed, the way they flashed, and making no noise what so ever. It didn’t look like it was one object because after the first sighting of lights, later on that same day, we saw two more similar flashing lights on the same flight pattern. The lights were headed northeast on the right side of the constellation. Then after we saw those sets of flashing lights. My wife starring at Orion’s belt for some reason, she noticed a reddish round shaped dimming light at a very high altitude moving slowly between Orion’s belt and the a yellow bright star or planet in the night sky. I felt amazed and something made me keep a closer watch sense then. On the 23 of January, my brother and I were talking about the lights and I was hoping that he might have the chance to see something and at about 7:30 PM, he and his wife saw two pairs of flashing lights Identical to what me and my wife saw before. He pointed out that what was very weird was the way the lights flashed, he said they didn’t look like anything he had seen before in his life! And just recently as the 27 of January, my family and I saw a bright light that appeared from no where and traveled right in front of us a very high altitude but close enough for us to see that it was no commercial plain nor did it make a sound! After 10- 15 minutes it just faded into the night and vanished. We were hoping to see it light up ! again, b ut it never did! So now after all these lights in the sky you can say, “I definitely got me wondering why have there been so many sightings all of the sudden, in Arizona and Mexico recently and now Miami? It is difficult to  believe it and say, “Ah forget it it’s a military plain or something man made! I got so many questions, such as if and when I see un-identifying lights again in the night sky”! What to do? 	Do I take a pictures, or film it? 	Do I call the Airport and ask if they know what it is? “Will they tell me if it ain’t a plain? I don’t think so”! 	Do I call the news stations? And without a picture or footage, will they take me seriously, and will they report my call?  Listen I know I’m not crazy, cause I wasn’t the only one that saw them and couldn’t identify what they were, so… I have an XL2 Cannon Digital Camera and believe me, it is fully charged and ready to get footage of these lights in the sky as soon as they come way!!! Thank You…<n>
1/8/08 05:00|Springfield|MA|Formation|2 minutes|1 large light  center, 3 lights on either side  1 additional light off to right side, width of 5 c-5 aircrafts side by side.|2/14/08|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/061/S61062.html|358|ndxe200801| 1 large light  center, 3 lights on either side  1 additional light off to right side, width of 5 c-5 aircrafts side by side.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At 5:00am on January 8, 2008 I stepped outside to get a.m. newspaper and looked up when I heard a low droning noise above.  Sound was much lower than typical aircraft that pass over, and not as loud as jets or c-5 aircraft that I am familiar with hearing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The morning sky was crystal clear as was evident when a shooting star passed directly under the object I saw and was very bright, and there were many stars out.<n> <n><n> <n><n> An object was approaching from the west and moving toward south east.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object above looked to be approximately the width of five C-5 aircraft and was moving very slowly.  I saw one large central light, that appeared to have more than one color and on either side of the center light there were 4 smaller lights, spaced out at regular intervals of perhaps 200 ft  between and 1 light off the right side set back and apart from the rest.  All moved at the same uniform speed while approaching me and moving over me.  The lights were dim, as if behind a cloud, although there appeared to be no clouds in the area.  I assumed it was very high in the sky.  I cannot estimate height, but from where I stood it appeared to be the width above mentioned.  I was unable to see a distinct form of airplane(s), only the light formations.  I initially though that perhaps this was a large aircraft with jets flying on the sides in formation, however, the object remained in the same configuration while it passed over me, and after passing directly over the 8 lights on either side of the main central light started to change configuration in that they circled around each other, but remained at the same speed as the object.   I then thought that there were no way these were jets flying in formation because the lights could not have circled around each other.  They continued to do this until they were too far off in the horizon for me to see.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

There was no blinding lights like what people say, it didn&#39;t look clean and shiney either. It moved very slow and was about 2 and 3 stories high in the air and there was a sound that came from it(like a radio wave sound). It was about 60 feet from my car. It came over a house, it moved about 5mph and move to the middle of the street and stopped( it was facing me).It scared the heck out of me and I wasn&#39;t going waiting around to find out was else was going to happen. I took of quickly and called my husband and and asked him to go out and tell me what he saw. He said that there was nothing out there but that entire weekend choppers flew in the skys all day. Before then they were not doing that. That night and the entire weekend (at night)there w! as a light that would turn different colors but it was was still directly even with our street. I am a business owner dont want to be contacted so please don&#39;t contact me. I just wanted to say what I saw.

Goddard and other towns west of the city this morning because of what Westar officials are calling &#34;a transmission event&#34; at the utility&#39;s substation in west Wichita.<n> <n><n> <n><n> &#34;We don&#39;t know for sure exactly what happened,&#34; Westar spokeswoman Erin La Row said Tuesday morning. Reports of multiple transformers blowing at Westar&#39;s substation at 226 N. Hoover may not be accurate, La Row said. &#34;It&#39;s been described as a &#39;transmission event,&#39; &#34; she said, though she could not provide more details yet.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Widespread power outages were reported west of Ridge Road in Wichita, as well as in Goddard, Garden Plain, Cheney and Pretty Prairie, she said.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The outages are affecting homes, businesses and schools, officials say.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At least four schools in USD 259 lost electricity and went to backup generators, district spokeswoman Susan Arensman said: Peterson Elementary, 9710 W. Central; Wilbur Middle School, 340 N. Tyler; McCollom Elementary, 1201 Waddington; and Levy Special Education Center, 400 N. Woodchuck.<n> <n><n> <n><n> &#34;We might have more schools&#34; lose electricity as the morning progresses, Arensman said. &#34;This thing is obviously changing as we go.&#34;  &#34;Pretty much all&#34; of the traffic lights in northwest Wichita are not working as a result of the outage, a Sedgwick County dispatch supervisor reported. But traffic appears to be flowing smoothly despite the outages, Patrol West Bureau Sgt. Guy Schroeder said. Police have been sent to high-traffic intersections, he said, but no problems have been reported.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

There was very little light pollution and the sky was the clearest I had seen for at least a week.  The Object was a &#34;round&#34; greenish-blue ball that moved from the North to the Southeast not in an arc, rather in a straight line.  This was not a shooting star as it moved extremely slow, I would estimate the altitude at 13,000 ft, and as I indicated earlier the trajectory was not in an arc.  Judging by the trajectory, this object may have landed in a nearby Tennessee State Park.  Upon following a truck to the Hurricane Mills, TN exit at a fuel stop there I asked him if he saw the same object and he indicated as such that he had seen the same object.  I travel a great deal in my Job Duties, often at night due to the lighter traffic around metropolitan areas of Knoxville, Memphis and Nashville, TN.  I have seen other aerial phenomenon during the other that I travel but none not quite as unusual as this.  First the color of the object, speed and travel path.  This object was not of earthly origin.  I told this story to my girl friend who said I should contact your website, which I have and am thankful to &#34;air&#34; this matter in your forum.  I have a PhD and am not deranged or a mental case, again thank you for hearing me out.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

I believed it was a shooting star until all of a sudden it stops completely. My friend in the car asks me what I was looking at and I just pointed up in astonishment. As he looks up the light pulls off to the south at an abrupt speed like one of a shooting star. My friend says make a wish and I tell him that was no star that it came to a dead stop. I was then shaking and burned out as fast as I could. No Idea what I saw except it was circle shape and like a deep blue color.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The size of the light was about three time that of a planet&#39;s viewed from earth (like Venus). The object faded from very bright intensity to dull (like how bright a star is) about 2-3 times as I watched it. It made no sound at all, so I doubt it was a helicopter, and there were no blinking lights, so I don&#39;t think it was an airplane. At first I thought it might be a satellite, but it was not traveling in a straight line. First, it was moving to the north-west, and as I watched it it changed direction and came towards me in an east direction. It continued at a steady speed, which was faster then an airplane could go, passed almost directly over me, and continued on in an easterly direction, until I couldn&#39;t see it anymore because a house blocked my view.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The object was a glowing yellow orb approaching very slowly in the sky. This orb must have been about 10,000 feet in altitude. As it came closer,I noticed this orb had spike shaped glowing projections coming out of it. It continued onward to the west until it was out of sight. This happened again on January 10, 2008. This time two others saw the orb with me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.  PD))<n>

It seemed to be hovering low because it was a overcast morning and this was for sure below the clouds. It headed north towards the Phelps Dodge Mine then it took a sharp ninety degree turn and headed west towards Pima ,AZ. I watched the object until it was out of sight. This object did seem to move at a very slow speed and was definatlely not a helicopter or plane , very weird!!<n>

As I was staring out the window I saw an extremely bright light. What I saw looked like a comet but without a tail. It got brighter and brighter and closer and closer to land. I could tell that the object was spinning while at the same time it was giving off light from the center. The closer it got to land other lights, smaller lights started appearing near it. They also looked like they were spinning. They seemed to be arranged in groups that were approaching land. In that moment I ran to wake up my family so they could see what I was seeing but by the time they were up the objects had gone farther up into the sky. I couldn’t believe what I was seeing. Initially I thought they were starts but soon after I knew that they were nothing like stars.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

On January 5th, 2008 evening time around a pm, I was standing in the balcony with my father and I just could not believe what I saw. Some twinkling lights in a circular shape high in the sky. It wasn&#39;t so high as I could judge the distance because of the size. My first impression was that its a UFO but my father kept saying its a helicopter or a plane but I was sure it wasn&#39;t. I tried to capture it with my phone camera (2MP) but it wasn&#39;t too bright.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I kept thinking what was it. I have seen tons of UFO pictures and videos so it straight away strike my mind. I researched about it on the Internet and found  a similar picture and I was amazed that it was a UFO only. Heres the link to the story and coincidence is that it was seen in India too and to in Himachal Pardesh which is near Chandigarh. http://www.greatdreams.com/himalayan/skull3.html Please scroll down and you will see.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am informing you as I am one of those who really believes in UFO and are volunteer to think that we are not alone in the universe.<n> <n><n> <n><n> If they are seen yesterday they might be visiting again. I just like to tell you to keep searching for them and it could be a great chance to see the UFO.<n>

It moves about a ft. off the ground under the power lines which I didn&#39;t see just the pole against the snow. It started to turn to the left as if it had feelers to go around a pine tree. it aligned it self turned to the left &amp; started to rise higher like 6ft. I could see the top of the tree. It was half the size of the pine tree high. I move to the right of my window to get a better look as it is moving now into a patch of woods with higher Maple &amp; Beech trees. It was going very slow. I wanted to reach around the corner to get my camera but no it might flash? I see now it is black in the middle with s triangle shape &amp;  amber lights all around the craft. Amber as in a car? I blink my eyes &amp; poof it is gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Next day I told my husband &amp; 2 neighbors. Within 2 days I hear of a UFO sighting in Texas. The lights were red &amp; big as a football field.  To get the exact date would be 2 days before the Texas 2008 sightings. Larry King had the people on his show who saw them in Texas.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I tried to put this out of mind &amp; sight. But no longer as something was seen only 4mi. from here a few wks. ago. 3 people saw it. I tried to email to fox news I doubt it worked is why I am typing this now. I feel something is going on up here in Gods Country  of Potter County,Pa. Thanks.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I saw an orange ball (very similar to a dimmed, almost off bulb) traveling from west to east at a very impressive speed. From the moment that I started lookig at it until the moment that I lost it it was like 15 seconds. I have never seen an object traveling on the air so fast. I have seen many times satellites on very dark nights and I know this was not one of those. I also love watching planes an I am positive this was not a plane either. Absolutley silent, very smooth, very fast nice color, similar to the orange moons that you sometimes get to see.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was quite a remarkable sight.

On first glance I thought it was a low flying plane then that didn&#39;t seem right so I figured it was a cell phone tower with exceptionally bright lights at the top. The shape of the object was horizontal bright lights at either end and dimmer lights in between.  As I got closer to the object it became obvious that it wasn&#39;t a cell phone tower because it seemed to be right over the highway.  I was actually able to drive under the lights. As I got closer and was actually under the object the shape seemed different... The bright lights and dimmer lights were still there but I seems to have a different shape...there were more lights and they were different colors. I have never seen anything so strange before, and as I drove under it, the object seemed almost stationary.  I didn&#39;t hear any noise or experience any loss of power in my car. There were other cars around me at that time but I have no idea if anyone else saw the object other than me.  As I passed under the object I glanced in my rearview mirror to see if I could still see the object but it seemed to have disappeared.  In an attempt to explain the lights I scanned the area behind me see if I could see where they came from but there was no bright lights or anything that could have produced them...<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am a graduate student at the University of Kansas. I have never before had an encounter with an unidentified flying object.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The Dutch weather agency did and they never encountered such a thing and to their knowledge nothing should of been in the air here. I browsed the internet and more of such reports where reported (I only checked Dutch sites so far)    The past days we (neighbours and friends at our party) saw a kind of fireballs/lightballs in the sky. About 100 metres in the air in a constant direction on a constant speed (approximately 30 miles/50 kilometres an hour). Sometimes they changed course and speed. It does this in a manner so it could not be an air-balloon, helicopter or an airplane.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Basically it kind of looks like a huge firefly or a constant fire of an airballoon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We are down to earth people and the fact that we nor anyone who saw the objects could identity it makes it strange. This is not a hoax or thrillseeking kind of story.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Basically, could you please tell us what it could of been? We&#39;re guessing some kind of natural/geographical/etc. thing but seeing as how many reports I encounter about this, it is getting eery.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thank you in advance for your answer!    Kind regards,    F V  (from The Netherlands)    PS I sent this e-mail to various agencies and such in hopes of getting a well informed answer.<n>

Maybe that is the new lights put on the planes now and they This morning I saw a  bright light like a star to the west Sat. It was constantly moving fast towards my house. I thought it was a star and the clouds were moving fast. Then I looked again and the clouds were moving slow compared to the light. The light was almost above me to the south. I looked underneath it and saw complete white light. A silver white light really bright  that radiated thick rays of light in 360 degrees like a slightly sqaushed circule.  The light was blinding I saw spots. I could almost feel the energy.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I went down the stairs of the deck and around the house to see more, but it went almost out of sight real fast in the east direction like a bright light becoming dimmer over ontop of the clouds. I did not see an object and the light was too bright. and it faded away into the east. There where no red or blue lights flashing and I see planes all the time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Nor did I see the windows of a plane with lights on not even from behind did I see any flasing red or blue lights. There was no tail or smoke or &#34;&#34;noise&#34;&#34; and it looked closer than most planes and I hear the sounds all the time even when they are further away. It was today Sat at 7:30 am. I have seen double shooting stars or little meters at dust shoot across the sky and they where more orange blue yellow like  with a puffy look to them and tails of there trail as they burned out in the atmosphere. I see the satilites move through space an clear nights May be the planes have new lights that are so bright that the light radiates so much that the red and blue lights and the object of the plane can not be seen at all going N. west to S. east and one can no longer see blue or red lights. The sky was clear only for less than a mile and blue. Light dims out in light and this object was bright. I could see the rays.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object was fast. The measurement from my piont of sight left the object looking 10 inches by 7inches as the closest piont of vision. I could see the the rays of light as if looking at are going much faster now.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is the first time I have seen this and I have been allover the NWT. USA, Yukon, Europe, Canada.  If I can not explain it report it. It seemed to slow down when it passed over my head slightly to the south and when I got aroungd the house it shot off into the distance. Real Strange. I became scared and have had trouble falling a sleep and a little scared to go out alone out side my house to have a smoke. Because that was what I was doing at thae time and staring at the sky as I have always like to do.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

They seemed to be black but the color kept changing tint, from dark black to light black to a more metallic black etc. We counted a total of 12 of these craft, and they continued flying in the air where we could clearly see them for at least an hour.

This light was in the South East sky and we noticed it around 7:45 PM.  The light was very bright and seemed at first to be a plane or helicopter of some kind but we noticed it wasn’t moving. If it was moving it was at such an altitude we could not tell. Like I said the light was very bright. The light was blinking red, blue, and white. From the blinking you could see what appeared to be a triangle of light creating itself every time it blinked. The light seemed to get brighter and blink in a pattern – we watched it for awhile (approx. 30 min) and then went inside.<n> <n><n> <n><n> While watching the light moved back and forth in sudden motions approxiamtely 1/2 inch the sky.  Approx at 9:30 we went to see if the light were still visible in the sky it had moved more south and wasn’t blinking as much.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We at first thought this might be a plane or helicopter. We ruled that out as we could see other planes in the sky at what appeared to be the same altitude and they were moving much faster. We also thought it might be a tower of some sort since at first it was stationary. We ruled that out when we watched several planes fly across the path of the light and it moved. Our next thought was maybe it was some astronomical event so we researched the news, Google Earth’s sky charts, and other astronomy databases. We didn’t find anything remotely close to the area except for Sirius and the description did not match what we witnessed. We also checked the alignments of the planets and noticed the planets were in a straight line on Google Earth - but the only visible one was Mars. We had been watching Mars for a week or so now so we have been watching the sky. We lined up Mars with Orion&#39;s belt to see if we could locate this flashing light  - but we could not.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As the time passed the light did not follow the path of the other stars and did seem dimmer.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We didn’t want to report it to the local news out of fear of being laughed at but we wanted to know if you people had any other reports of a similar affect. Also if you had not what this light might have been.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thank you  ((name and e-address deleted))<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Possibly Sirius??  PD))<n>

It was distinctly diamond-shaped and had two small orange glowing lights facing us (the light to the right was slightly higher than the left).<n> <n><n> <n><n> At this point I was sure this was neither airplane nor helicopter as airplanes in my area have green, white, red, or blue lights and make very detectable sounds at night as do helicopters. It was also much too large to be a helicopter or a small airplane. The craft was moving unbelievably slow, almost as if it were hovering. After a couple of minutes of observation the orange lights started to fade until the whole craft including lights and silhouette disappeared completely. Again, this was a clear night so it had nothing to hide behind.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Note: My sister would not like to be contacted about this report/information.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It wasn&#39;t so high as I could judge the distance because of the size. My first impression was that its a UFO but my father kept saying its a helicopter or a plane but I was sure it wasn&#39;t. I tried to capture it with my phone camera (2MP) but it wasn&#39;t too bright.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I kept thinking what was it. I have seen tons of UFO pictures and videos so it straight away strike my mind. I researched about it on the Internet and found  a similar picture and I was amazed that it was a UFO only.

In actuality I have shared my experiences with family members and friends for years, but not until recently did I think that anything that I had to share would be relevant or of any importance or interest to an official UFO investigative or reporting agency.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In recent months there have been several televised reports: UFO Hunters, UFO Files, etc. on television that I have watched that have convinced me to pass on some information that may help.  I am not writing for any recognition or monetary gain.  However, I am willing to take any type of lie detector test, medical test that you or someone else may want me to submit to, in order to verify any information I am sharing with you now or in the future.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 1.) I have been in the medical laboratory field just short of 20 years, so you will be able to appreciate my confusion while I was watching a report on cattle mutilations when a prominent doctor (omitted name per your instruction) said, &#34;I am not aware of that many similarities between bovine blood and human blood.&#34;  Either this is a doctor I would never want to go to or he was telling a boldfaced lie.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In the laboratory there are several types of automated pieces of equipment to analyze everything from thyroid function to bacterial infections and STD’s.  All of these machines need to be calibrated with positive and negative controls, nearly ALL of which are made out of bovine blood, BECAUSE IT IS SO SIMILAR TO HUMAN BLOOD.<n> <n><n> <n><n> While working for one of the top DNA and GENETICS companies in the US, nearly all of our research incorporated the use of bovine blood, because of the similarities.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 2.)  During one of my dad’s encounters with, for lack of better words, the aliens, he asked them why they were here.  The answer he received was that they are here to harvest our planet’s abundant resource of bdellium and its anti-gravitional properties.  Do I know anything about bdellium?  I haven’t got a clue!  But that is the answer my dad got.<n> <n><n> <n><n> He was also convinced that their being here was not a good thing for mankind.  He said they had cloaking abilities and that they could be standing right next to you, and you would never know.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had a first hand experience when I was in the backyard playing catch with a friend of mine.  We both saw a bird in mid flight hit what seemed like an invisible wall, make a loud thumping sound, and then it fell dead to the ground.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 3.)  From watching one of the episodes of UFO Hunter, they had two men who tested with unusually high ck levels.  If you have any more information on that, I would appreciate receiving it.  I am currently on full disability.  I have had cancer four times and am now struggling with a rare endocrine disease, similar to Addison’s, but I am not responding well to treatment.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At some point in my youth I received a straight incision on my backside that I have memories of receiving while surrounded by many “beings”.  My dad was there.  My mother was not and when I have asked her questions regarding what it is and why I have it, she has no recollection of me ever having an injury there.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At the very least, my body seems unusually prone to sickness.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have had several encounters over the years, starting with seeing something in the park on my 8th birthday.  My brothers and I saw a glowing ball of light hovering in front of the screen door while my parents were in Pittsburgh. My older brother was watching us and we were terrified.  All clocks in the house stopped.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We moved from Pa. to Ohio, and things continued.  My mom and I were out taking a summer drive and just talking when we saw something flying over us.  It went very fast and kept making abrupt changes in direction.  We looked for a road to turn around on and when we turned into a drive to do that we were stopped by what looked like military guards that ordered us to stop and get out of there.  My mom explained that was exactly what she had intended to do anyway.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As recently as this year I watched a very large whatever go over the house here in Tx.  It wasn&#39;t like you could see it.  It blocked out things as it went overhead.  It was totally dark and totally quiet.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There are many more encounters that I could share, but it is not these little incidents that matter.  What I felt I needed to share was the info on the bdellium and the bovine blood.  If it helps, I am glad.  Do I believe we are being visited? Yes.  Do I believe we should trust them? No.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.  PD))<n>

Perfect bottom of saucer type hole pushing down through cloud layer 1/4/2008<n> <n><n> <n><n> Driving home from work saw the strangest thing I have ever witnessed in my 55 years. Punching through a cloud layer appeared to be a huge saucer shape actually forcing the clouds downward below it. I thought at the time that it must be just a rare weather event and even though it held my attention for the next half hour of the drive home, I dismissed it as just being rare but a natural thing. At home I read the news on the net and then went on to u-tube and I could not believe my eyes! I watched a video from the other side of the world showing the &#34;exact&#34; thing that I had just witnessed! Exact!The size they gave was Exactly the same as what I saw! Identical!<n>

After the sound of two military aircraft traveling at high speed had passed I heard something overhead moving at high speed through the air. There was an unusual pulsing sound along with a soft hum. I looked up and saw a craft much like one of those shown in todays Discovery channel broadcast on UFO&#39;s in Illinois. This sighting was in broad daylight. There were no flashing lights. The object stopped about 1,000 ft. overhead.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As best as I can determine, it left heading in a SSW direction at a remarkably high speed. I reported this to the local Sabine County Reporter. There was no follow up. 3 or four days later I saw reports of other Texas sightings on Headline news.

1/4/08 00:00|Indianapolis|IN|Triangle|1 hour?|Multiple Triangle shaped UFO's in V formation, then slowly follow interstate in Indianapolis|3/4/08|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/061/S61684.html|400|ndxe200801| Multiple Triangle shaped UFO&#39;s in V formation, then slowly follow interstate in Indianapolis<n> <n><n> <n><n> On the morning of January 4th, 2008, just after midnight, my Fiancée and I were driving east on E 96th street in Indianapolis, IN. As we approached Indianapolis Metropolitan Airport&amp;#8206; (a small Cessna airfield and flight school) to our north west, I noticed about 6 bright yellowish/white lights in a V pattern; only it looked more like a “check” because the last top-left area was not lit. I’m familiar with “Lights over Phoenix” and I called my good friend who is quite skeptical of the famous video. At this point, I assumed I was looking at a couple Cessnas doing night training, but I wanted to call my friend and tell him what I was seeing just for fun. While I was on the phone with him, my Fiancée pointed out that there was a 7th light now in the sky next to them- and much to my surprise, I looked up to see the 7th light duplicate to reveal an 8th light, which instantly glided into position, turning the “check” into a “V.”  Two minutes into the event, as we neared the small airport, it became evident that the lights were not tiny Cessna aircrafts. We could now also make out that each ball of light was in fact three large white lights, as if a commercial airliner had a large spherical light on the bottom-front of the plane and one large spherical light on each wing tip. About another 30 seconds passed and the “V” shape broke up and each aircraft began to pass over head. At a stop light, I opened my car door and stepped out to get a better look at these “planes.” It was when one was right over head that I noticed a tiny red beacon in the very center of the aircraft that was blinking. There were no stars in the sky, and I cannot 100% fully verify that the triangle shaped craft was connected all the way around- but for whatever reason, despite never seeing a photo of one, I just assumed it was triangle shaped. It’s like I could make out the darker matter. I couldn’t make out wings or anything, but my mind saw it as a triangle.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My fiancée asked me what was going on, and I told my friend I would call him back. I told her I thought the planes were actually “UFO’s” because at that point I had no idea what they were and I wanted to scare her. They were large, triangular shaped crafts who made no noise as they passed overhead. I’ll reiterate that it was midnight on a deserted street and literally no noise could be heard. I turned into an apartment complex and physically got out of my car and attempted to take a picture with my phone. My hand couldn’t stay still and with the VGA resolution I snapped a blurred picture that looked more like headlights than anything else. I deleted it when I got home (before I realized the significance of our encounter.)  Because I couldn’t bring myself to fathom alien crafts, and my fiancée didn&#39;t appreciate me trying to freak her out, I just assumed I was witnessing some new airliner which I’d never seen before and began to drive home. I took I-69 south and noticed one of the aircrafts following the highway. This struck me as extremely odd because I’ve lived in Indy for quite a while and never before had I seen a low flying airliner simply “follow” the highway. It passed overhead and I saw a few more off in the distance. It was actually really eerie. I’d never felt like that before.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I got home and Googled whether or not Indianapolis International had any delays or runways out, explaining why so many aircrafts were simply cruising around the city at low altitudes at midnight. Literally every flight was on time. That’s the last I thought about this event until today when I stumbled upon a website describing these triangle shaped UFO’s with three white lights and a center red beacon. I noticed how they mentioned these crafts fly low over populated areas, and even follow highways. When I read that line I literally got chills. I’m not going on record saying I witnessed alien crafts, but I will stand by my report that I saw exactly what all of these websites are describing as “triangle shaped UFOs.” The physical description and behaviors mimic exactly as what I witnessed. I felt that I had an obligation to tell somebody or some organization that I witnessed a number of these crafts. I’d sure like to know what they were. I’d draw you a picture but it would look exactly like the dozens out on the web right now, except the center red light was about a quarter of the size as the three white lights. Well, that’s that.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The object seemed to be traveling along the street, toward us, but moving very slowly and only flying about 200-300 ft off the ground above the street.  Originally 2 lights were in view, but as we got closer, I noticed that there were 3 lights on the bottom of the craft, in a triangle formation.  At this point I was literally yelling at my sister to confirm the object herself, and she seemed very concerned about it as well.  The object then passed directly over our vehicle while we were stopped at a light.  I stuck my head out the window to get a better look at the object, and to see if there were any sounds coming from the craft... there were none, which seemed very disturbing to me.  I asked my sister if she heard anything, such as helicopter rotors or an aircraft engine, and she said she did not.  As I looked straight up at the craft, I very clearly saw that it was triangular in shape, with a circular light at each tip, and an illuminated white line connecting each light.  There was also a square panel at the bottom of the craft that was glowing red, and a smaller yellow light next to that that was pulsing.  I have never seen anything like this before.  The craft moved so slowly that it is impossible to have stayed airborne if it were a plane, and absolutely no sound was heard coming from the craft at close proximity to indicate that it was some sort of helicopter. The object then continued east down the Blvd. until it was out of sight. This object must surely have been seen by many observers, and after seeing it, cars around us were driving erratically, passing each other on city streets illegally and driving very fast.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

After I passed the New Kingston exit while still traveling east I spotted off to my North out of the corner of my eye what appeared to be a light pink aura moving below cloud level to the point that it refracted the color off the bottom of the cloud cover, to appear as if it was in the clouds.  It was traveling from North West in a South Eastern direction.  I was traveling 65mph and at this point, I followed it until it went over my car and then coming back into view through the front windshield of my car.  It could’ve been at least 1500 feet from the ground and the speed was that of a slow moving commuter flight.  I followed it as it moved out of my viewing distance as it was traveling south east and keeping my eye on it and the road was nearly impossible.  I can honestly say that I do not believe that it was a jet flight due to the fact that there were no FAA lights on it or giving the appearance of an aircraft of any sort.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

1/3/08 20:30|Flat Rock|AL|Diamond||Odd shifting light that changes colors and has never been seen in the sky around my house since I  have lived there possible UFO?????|1/21/08|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/060/S60658.html|404|ndxe200801| Odd shifting light that changes colors and has never been seen in the sky around my house since I  have lived there possible UFO?????<n> <n><n> <n><n> Let me start with I don’t believe in UFO’s but this is something rare that I have never seen before in my life. So I got witnesses to verify that I am not going crazy and everyone saw the same thing. So here is my report.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was outside looking at the sky as I do most nights and see the constellations in the winter.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I saw what looked like a very bright star. But it was flashing different color lights; red, blue, green, and white. The longer I watched it I noticed that it was not just sitting in one place. When actually it would sit still for a little while and then dart to the right, then sit still and dart to the left. The one thing that I did notice is that it did not have a certain pattern in the movement so you never knew which direction it was going to move. The whole time it was moving it was climbing higher and higher. While it was darting left and right it was not so fast that you could not see it, and the light did not blur or trail so I assumed it was a long ways off. But this I can not be sure of. We was not able to see the shape of the object. It just looked like a big diamond in the sky, and every once in a while a light would shine into it and make like a prism of light. I guess it looked as if someone wearing this diamond on their hand and would move the hand every now and again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The location of this light was directly east of our home. It was just above the tree line behind my house. The tree’s there are about 40 foot tall. And they are located about 100 yards behind my house. The ground slopes up at about 5 degrees from the back of my house to the tree line. Hopefully this will give you enough information to figure out a close estimate of where it was in the sky. It was also right below the belt of Orion.<n> <n><n> <n><n> If there is anything explainable about this the please contact me and let me know. I also have the information on how to get in contact with the wittnesses.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It appeared just to be a bright star at first but started changing colors.  After about twenty minutes, i went back outside and saw the light still there but seemed to have moved southeast some.  I went inside and asked my roommate to come look along with his girlfriend.  They both saw it also.  The light seemed to be red on top with flashing of blue and green around it.  It seemed to be very distant but very bright.  Probably nothing but it also seemed to be spinning rapidly.  So much staring probably caused it to just appear that way.  Just thought it was unusual, but i did see something similar earlier this year in almost the same location.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The smoke ring was constant and not moving.  It was a partly cloudy day, no rain and no wind.  The object was just North of Angels Stadium.  I tried to take a picture with my camera phone, but the smoke ring wasn&#39;t in the photo, just a bright light.  I never saw the object change appearance, but I had to keep driving and lost sight of the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I woke up and looked at the vcr which read 2:41. There was an odd buzzing noize and a strange light pattern on the cieling above us. I heard scuffling sounds in the kitchen behind my head and became intensely afraid. Just as I was about to investigate three distinct figures with huge heads and small bodies &#34;glided&#34; into the room. The room was dark but I could plainly see that they were not human! There is light from the street that comes in enough to where i can make out a face. These things were wearing dark coveralls that ere tight and showed off skinny bodies. They also wore msaks of some kind and all i could see as far as thier faces went was thier huge black eyes surrounded by patches of light skin in the eye slits of the masks. Thier beltlines were about level with the bed so i guees they are about 4&#39; tall. I was NOT asleep or dreaming! I was immediately terrified out of my mind and tried to scream but could not even move. It was as if a nightmare was coming true. Supe-sureal as the people who witnessed 9-11 must have felt as the planes hit or towers came down. One stood at the foot of the bed and the other two were on my side. Mywife stayed asleep. they were making strange noises as if breathing through ventilators. Ialso heard mechanical sounds. Almost immediately I was lifted into the air afoot or two as if by magic. I could still feel the skin of my wife&#39;s shoulder under my hand and the blanket on top of us as well as open space and cool air below. I sensed movement all around and the room seemed to wobble and spatially distort. I tried to kick at them but could notmove so I tried to lean from side to side in the air. I calledout mentally for God and the Lord Jesus Christ to save me and instantly I was back on the bed and the beings and strange glow was gone. The Lord saved me from those things. It was not as if I was set down or just woke up. It was as if one moment I was up in the air and the next moment I was down. I didn&#39;t even blink! They were gone! I know that this was no dreamas it seemed real and the memory hasn&#39;t faded one bit as dreams do. i woke up my wife in a panic but did notwant to scare her so I let her fall beck asleep without telling her until the next day. Besides Iknew that Jesus would not let them return. I remember that at least 20 minutes had passed but do not remember the time it was over exactly. I only remember less than a few minutes of it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Praise God!!! This is not the first time.<n>

As I looked thru my gridded front window I saw what appeared to be like three (3) white lights in the night sky decending in altitude. The lights halted and remained stationarry for about 15-20 minutes, when I fell asleep. Sightings were by naked eye (could not find my field glasses. I know the object was stationary after moving, because my reference point was two of the grill squares in the window and my head in bed was stationary.<n> <n><n> <n><n> No planes to my knowledge opearte to providence airport during these wee morning hours and I doubt a helicopter was in the area. The lights were all I could see and they were white to bluish white and constantly on. The craft was too far away to judge if there was any noise involved.  When Stationary - it was between 2 and 2:30 o&#34;clock from true North and elevation was 30 to 40 degrees Azimuth (elevation)  I now have my field glasses and if this repeats I will be prepared to be more specific.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I pulled into the parking lot and I happened to look up at the sky. About a half a mile down the road was a pair of bright white lights about 50 to 75 feet apart. Between the two white lights were four yellowish-brown square shaped lights. What ever this was hovered above the road about 100 feet off of the ground for about 10 minutes. It didn&#39;t make any noise. After about 10 minutes the lights just went off. It might be helpful to know that this happened about a mile from the bloomsburg airport which is a small airport where small single propeller planes and helicopters land. This object I saw in the sky didn&#39;t look like and aircraft I have ever seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

1/3/08 00:20|Clover|SC|Unknown|10 minutes|Craft sighting in SC. Complex lighting system and lack of conventional engine noise.|1/21/08|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/060/S60665.html|414|ndxe200801| Craft sighting in SC. Complex lighting system and lack of conventional engine noise.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Jan. 03, 2008  To whom it may concern:<n> <n><n> <n><n> I would like to report a sighting. The sighting event started at approximately 12:20am this morning January 03, 2008. Before going to bed last night I stepped outside on our front porch. We live in a rural residential neighborhood outside of the Charlotte, NC area. Temperature was in the 30’s and it was a clear night. We are on a cul-de-sac so there was no traffic or other noise. I began to notice on the horizon a bright white light approaching from the south and being familiar with CLT landing pattern assumed it was a larger jet on approach. The light did not appear to be moving towards the airport but directly towards me. I kept waiting for the noise of a jet, but then began to expect hearing a copter noise because of how slow the object was moving. It all of a sudden seemed then to be moving perpendicular to my location in front of me. This craft appeared to be ¼ to ½ mile away from me and an estimated 800 ft. in altitude.  It was hard to get a perspective of the size because it was dark but judging by the lights I would estimate maybe 75 ft long by 20 ft high. I am not sure of width because of direction traveling. The most fascinating observations about this sighting were the lights on the craft and the lack of noise. In regards to the noise, there was a faint hum/rumble, I say rumble because I could tell and felt that it was powerful. The lighting on the craft was very foreign to me. I have been pursuing my pilot’s and flown with my father for the past twenty-five years so I am familiar with plane/copter lighting configurations. On the front of the craft, which appeared to compose ¼ of its height was a bright white light, but it wasn’t white. It looked like one of the H.I.D (High Intensity Discharge) lighting systems found on higher end vehicles these days. The intensity however was much stronger that automobile types. This light appeared to move along the side of the craft from front to half way down the length of the craft in a sweep. It would do this slowly back and forth. In the middle belly of ! the craf t there looked to be a strobe and red light. The main body and tail/aft section had four red lights staggered in a diamond. On the rear there was a bright white/blue light. This describes the craft from what I saw and the light configuration on the craft. Again, the lack of engine noise was very impressive. The craft moved slowly away from my sight and then turned north and disappeared at a quicker pace and I heard more rumble, but not that of a turbine jet engine.  The entire sighting lasted approximately ten minutes.<n>

We were just waking out the back door of my store looking out at the Gallatin Mountains.  We saw what look like a flash of light moving east heading towards the Gallatins  It was about 5:30 and was getting dark but you could still see the sky which was clear.  There was no vapor trail and this was no plane.  It looked like it stopped almost right on top of one of the shorter Gallatin peaks.  It seemed like it was hovering there for about 30 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We didn&#39;t really notice any flashing lights other than the a very slight glow it was putting off.  All of a suden it took off in a southward direction from an almost standstill to the a streak of light and then was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness does not indicate date of sighting.

There were blue mist like exhaust on each side of it.  these were not flames.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was frightened when I saw this.  It traveled from the west to the east.

1/2/08 23:00|Shippensburg|PA|Triangle|4 minutes|Around the evening of January 2nd, 2008 I was driving home from my girlfriend's house in the countryside surrounding Shippensburg Penns|1/10/09|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/066/S66620.html|419|ndxe200801| Around the evening of January 2nd, 2008 I was driving home from my girlfriend&#39;s house in the countryside surrounding Shippensburg Pennsylvania.  I noticed an aircraft in the  distance around 10-20 miles away.  At first it did not seem out of the ordinary but I noticed that the craft began to move in ways that no human aircraft that I know of could move. It would hover over an area but then it would move instantly in another direction. It seemed that it could move in any direction and  be able to stop instantly. I am not an aviation expert but I do not believe that any human aircrafts could have been able to move like this one did. I was alone on a country road and I pulled my car over and stared at the object for several minutes. It moved throughout the valley in the way I described before it suddenly zipped far away out of site. At the time I did not know how to react to what I saw, but around 6 months later I was talking to  friend when he told me that he had seen an object while driving on the Pennsylvania turnpike that same night. By the way he described the object I could tell he saw the same object. Also he told me that the traffic on the turnpike nearly came to a complete stop as all of the drivers were looking at the object. I would not be surprised if other people reported seeing this object as well.  I do know that Letterkenny army base, which has been used as a testing zone for covert military activities was within 20 miles of where I was when I saw the object. The object appeared to be triangular in shape, but I did not get a very good look at the object since it was off in the distance. What stood out for me was the irregular way in which the object moved, I have never in my life seen an aircraft move in that way. I consider myself a rational person and I don&#39;t consider myself a believer of alien visitors or abductions. I do know however that on that evening I saw something that I cannot explain, I hope that this report can help us piece together the puzzle and someday be able ! to figur e out exactly what the UFO phenomenon is.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.

I saw two seperate groups of some type of wierd form of flying machine. I thought wow I wonder who they are looking for...But then I notice..it was&#39;nt doing anything but,sitting in place..FOR A LONG TIME!.Suddenly like from a movie, another beam of light comes out of the cloud as if it was already there. As I was bugging out about what I was witnessing. I look further in the sky, and saw one very small cirlce object, with different color lights, blinking in a diamond like formation. It seem to either be small or very far, but the light did&#39;nt resemble anything I ever saw before, and being near a base you tend to be able to reconize every time of plane that flies over your house. Alot more happen, but I believe what I told you is more then enough...<n>

My Mom said there was a light out the window in the sky. We all looked out and seen a light in the sky it was flashing red green and blue it couldnt of been a star it was to low. It was flashing and hovering in the sky it wasen&#39;t moving forward  so it wasen&#39;t a airplane We were amazed at the sightimg but not shocked however because we had seen it before everynight in the summer it would be in the front of the house very low just above tree level hovering in the same place. Funny thing is its like it can hear me talking about it for example we havent seen it since the night i stood outside with my friend waitng to see it it never showed and never came back since. But just three nights ago i was telling a friend about it and lastnight it decided to come back. I dont know who else see&#39;s it around here, I dont know who to contact but i would realy like to know what it is?<n>

I was heading west, and the object seemed to be moving in a south-easterly direction. At first I thought it was a radio tower or something similar, but I soon realized that the lights were moving very slowly. As I came closer to the object I could see that it was cross-shaped and very thin and flat. It seemed to have triangular pieces connecting the wings to the tail. There were several red and blue lights along these connecting pieces, and they flashed on and off in a chasing pattern. The craft also had white lights on the nose, tail, and wings. It seemed to be about the size of a small one or two person plane. The craft moved very slowly and seemed to drift from side to side as it flew. At one point it began moving in small circles.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After a few minutes the object stopped in midair, and it seemed that one of the wings detached itself from the rest of the craft and drifted away from it as if it were a smaller pod or shuttle craft. It had only one single white light on it. This smaller craft hovered near the main object for a moment, and then both crafts began moving away in the same direction. I do not know if they parted ways later, as they were now flying away from my car and I did not feel safe stopping to watch them as I was alone and in a bad part of town. There were very few people around at the time, so I do not know if there were any other witnesses to the event. I told my boyfriend about it later that same night, and told my mother at a later date, but I do not think that either of them believed me. Also, there are two military bases and a small airport within a short distance of the area where this occurred, but I do not believe that what I saw that night was a military or commercial craft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.

Out of the corner of my eye I caught the object coming across the horizon from the east.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When it reached over about my 2 o&#39;clock, it slowed to a stop in a very short distance.  It was stopped just enough time for me to take a glance up at it, and get a look.<n> <n><n> <n><n> While it was traveling, it was a blue-green fireball with a good tail that faded fast.  When it stopped, it kept its blue-green color around it, in a circular shape, then proceeed on a western course.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It had to have been in the upper stratosphere, it had no noise to it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Not even 3 minutes after the object leaves, an aircraft was out circling the area where I had seen it.  At first I thought, well maybe its  just a student pilot, or an aircraft shooting an approach out at Tinker AFB. The aircraft was some sort of jet, i could hear it from the car, and it was more than likley a fighter (f-16&#39;s and f-15&#39;s are at tinker) because of the high angle banks it was making.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Also, that area where the jet was flying around is not an authorized training point for fighter jets, so all I can think is that this object was picked up on radar and a jet was sent to go check it out.<n>

This time it was moving from s/w to n/e and was silent and traveling fast. I and my son watched as it continued for what seemed like an extremely long time, which made me realize just how huge it was by how long it apperaed in my view between the mts. miles away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

I kept watching the sky and again it came across the sky in an easterly direction then completely disappeard.  After, on discussion, we agreed that it was not an aeroplane due to the 90 degree turn (and moving so much faster) and that also it was not a satalite due to its speed.  We were on vacation on the Pacific beach just 2 hours outside Panama (canal) city.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
1/2/08 18:30|Burlington (Canada)|ON|Disk|3-5 minutes|Disk with pulsing red light followed via car until it stopped above a field at close proximity to ground/roadside|1/21/08|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/060/S60643.html|427|ndxe200801| Disk with pulsing red light followed via car until it stopped above a field at close proximity to ground/roadside<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was heading down on Tremaine Rd towards Dundas at around 6:30pm. I had passed Britannia when I noticed a large red light coming into view from the top of my windshield, travelling in the same direction I was, above the land on the left side of the road. My first thought was that it was moving too fast to be an airplane, and it looked too low to the ground. I slowed my car down and kept switching between watching it and the road in front of me - I was curious enough to want to figure out whether or not it was an airplane or something else. The red light was large and it didn&#39;t blink in and out like an airplane - it pulsed, and on each pulse the light grew brighter and larger. It seemed to have stopped in the distance, as the light wasn&#39;t receding anymore. I turned my full concentration to driving a few bends in the road ahead and I noticed it started moving again, veering towards the right onto the fields on the side of the road closest to me. While it was turning I thought I could make out a bit of blue light on the side of it. I was trying to keep tabs on it but my view was then blocked by a close tree line. I saw it disappear behind the tree line and thought it had vanished. When the tree line ended, opening onto a long stretch of field, I was amazed to see it hovering above the middle of the field closest to the road, between 50-100 feet off the ground. The red light was still large, I honestly can&#39;t remember if it was still pulsing, and I could distinctly make out a strip of rectangular blue lights along the side of it. There was absolutely no noise coming from it, and the shape of it was hard to make out. Other than the lights, the rest of it blended into the night exceptionally well and the surface of it must have been non-reflective. Judging from its distance from the road, whatever it was couldn&#39;t have been much larger than a helicopter. It was too small to be a plane, too silent to be a helicopter, and I really don&#39;t think it&#39;s a military plane.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I was watching it in the field, the car behind me suddenly slowed down enough to make me wonder whether or not they had spotted what I was watching. I kept wondering whether or not I should stop and turn around. In the end, I just kept on driving.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The sighting occurred on Tremaine Rd between Brittania Rd W and 2nd Sideroad - the last I saw of the disk it was above the field on the west side of Tremaine between Lower Base Line W and 2nd Sideroad.<n>

I Tell you what I have seen on January 2 at 8:28 AM 2008 I was going to Vons grocery store at Downey California and I notice four UFO in low altitude hovering in straight formation over head. I thought that was seeing things. I ask an shopper that was leaving next to me and asked her what is that over head and she only stated that they are kites, others people did looked up and did nothing but stair for a moment. People that did seen what have seen just went on with there business. I was amazed what I have seen I look a closer look and notice orange orb hovering over head and a star light object at mush higher altitude hovering next to it. This was taking place of a period of ten to fifteen minus. After that I seen the conventional aircraft flown buy at low altitude heading south it was a twin engine propeller driven aircraft. Whatever they are, we are not alone in the universe. As for the other that seen this I really do understand how embarrassed it may be to tell other what you seen in fact no body would believe us anyway like the Arizona Lights . This really changes me and my prospective about religion and as for science goes we are still in the Stone Age using solid propellant rocket for propulsion.

I had noticed the trash was not taken up to our trash compartment so I grabbed it and headed up the hill East, looking out to our pasture I noticed that everything became a brilliant hue followed by a shadow of light this is the only way I know to explain it even the night time noise that your normally hear at night fell silent.  So much so it startled me and I looked up I saw three lights which really didn&#39;t alarm me but it grew brighter in the distance and so I thought oh cool a shooting star then it shot straight up in the air all three of them and turned kind of a golden brown then went back to a bright light again I stood gazing up at it thinking what the heck is this, then it just stopped right in the air and then shot straight across to the left  I did not have a camera on me except my cell phone that I had in my pocket so I grabbed it out and turned the camera part on and snapped the pictures.  This thing shot across the sky stopped again then literally went straight up and at an angel and then it was gone.  I have it on my phone still but it freaked me out so bad I was not going to tell anyone about this because they would think I am crazy as all get out but I have not been able to get that out of my mind the washing of light across the field like that and taking off straight up in the air stopping in thin air like that and turning was kind of freaky.  Even Tom&#39;s cows after a few seconds of that deafining silence started going nuts.

I heard then saw a commercial airliner crossing the sky.  It was very clear and moving fast.  Then I noticed another object flying in an exact opposite path that appeared to be a bit lower.  Its lights weren’t as bright as the planes but it had the same shape and size.  It looked like one object with a light on the nose, wingtips, and tail.  The tail light was red and the others where white.  I thought it was another plane until it moved sideways as it was going forward.  Not turning with the front light staying in front but more like drifting.  It also didn’t make a sound.  By now the jet was long gone.   This really caught my attention.  As it moved away, the lights on either side began to move inward into a single file line, still moving forward with the entire line shifting to the right all at once and continuing on its forward path.  I watched it for a few more seconds and then  it just vanished.  No noise was ever heard from the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am a 36 year old male.

It was a winter evening (2008 or 2009) around 6 to 7 pm (fully dark). It was overcast with cloud base at approx 100 m (300 ft).<n> <n><n> <n><n> I drove home from work, parked my car in the garage and went up the (outside) stairs to enter my house.  After a few steps on the stairs I could see over the garage and noticed a strange thing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Dim blueish green light sources on a circular pattern, about 10 pcs, rotating slowly around the center, about half rotation per sec.  It seemed as they were on the bottom of a circular object, which is spinning horizontally.  I could not see the object itself, so unsure about its shape, because there was not any backlight.  I could just see the lights on its bottom.  It was about 300 m away from me and with the little reference to other objects (some tall trees) I estimate its diameter to be 15 m, and its altitude 50 m over the land.  There is a main railway line at the edge of the village and it seemed a bit farther than that, over the lands.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was hovering, no movement and the rotation was also stable.  The lights were also stable in color and brightness.  First I thought someone was playing with kind of a disco laser light, which would probably project similarly on a very smooth cloud base.  But after about 5 seconds it started to move left (East) in a way what was very surprising to me and excluded the disco light possibility.<n> <n><n> <n><n> First it tipped left about 20 to 30 deg and started to move in that direction.  Then it tipped right the same amount, and continued this slow left-right tipping, while moving slowly to East (50 kmh?), and out of my sight (other buildings, trees and terrain blocking sight).<n> <n><n> <n><n> I told my wife what I just saw and to my workmates next day.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am an electrical engineer and have a PPL and tried to identify the object based on my knowledge, but I still cannot explain it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

I thought it was a cluster bomb or cruise missles at first until I saw the entity looked connected/swarming and to be composed of black triangles. We saw dull red lights blink on the perimeter of it and it seemed to change shape between a rotating triangular mass and then rectangular with imperfect corners. It flew silently and the sun was just setting so there was plenty of light and the sky was completely clear. It was as high up in the sky as a fighter jet and about the size of a football field. We tried to take a picture of it but it didn&#39;t show up on the phone. Triangular specks kept coming off of it and then would catch up to it as well. The mass hovered parallel to the horizon slowly and drifted off however relative to its size it was moving extremely fast. Another person I was with said it faded away at a much different time as I continued to see it with another person. It did resemble a balloon or parachute at times until it would break apart into a triangular pattern. I would estimate the entire mass was made of between 60-70 triangles.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Possible hoax??  PD))<n>

I was going about my business when my friend came running over to my tuck. I said whats wrong and he says &#34;Tell me what that is.&#34; pointing to the sky over the treetops. I looked up and saw about 9-10 balls(The sight was so amazing i forgot to count) of light (whitish bluish mix similar to LEDS Just barely could see them though) in a perfect circle similar in size to a moon in the sky when the object was above the treetops. The balls of light were on the edge of whatever it was to form a circle so it appeared. It fluttered around like a frisby or like a leaf falling to the ground or something blowing in the wind (seemed unstable). It would dissapear into the trees then reappear above them for a few minutes at a time at treetop level. We at first thought maybe it&#39;s a toy or something but then it rose very slowly thousands of feet up into the cloud cover then came back down then dissapeared into the trees. We then were perplexed by it. We waited for it to come back up but it never did so we went back plowing. I again though on the opposite side saw it popback up and hover in the same area as did my friend. Then it slowly rose up into cloud cover then was faintly visible then dissapeared into the night. I attempted video of it on my camera phone but the light from the school blocked it out so the background just looks black. I know what a plane&#39;s lights look like I know what a satelite looks like it was not any of this. We didnt hear any propulsion system as well you could hear the rumbles of passing airliner or jets in the distance here and there but nothing sounded to be comming form the objects direction. I was just curious for an explantion if any on this object.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

This is a daily ritual for me on the weekdays before I start work in the area. The sun had risen, and there were a few light clouds. There was no wind. The area is in the flight path of jets landing at Orlando International Airport, which is approximately 10 miles to the south.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was staring out over the lake when I looked up and noticed a black form flying towards the lake from the west. At first I thought it was a large bird such as a vulture or eagle circling over the lake. The object was dark, big, silent, and was not traveling at a high rate of speed. As I examined it more closely, I could see that it was not a bird. The object descended, and for a moment, I thought it could be someone parachuting into town, but I didn&#39;t see any evidence of a person beneath the object. It stopped descending and began to slowly fly to the northeast, towards the Casselberry area. Despite the object being very dark, the rear of the object reflected in the newly risen sun as it flew out of sight. There are some cypress trees by the lake, which obscured my view of the object as it flew away. When it was shining in the sun, it appeared to be spherical - I&#39;m not sure if the object actually changed shape as I watched it, or if I had misjudged its shape when I first noticed it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A few strange things about the object: It seemed to be flying low. It was difficult to determine its exact shape. It was completely silent. It seemed big, but I was unable to determine its size without a nearby sufficient frame of reference. The moon was still visible in the sky - if I had to compare it to the moon, I&#39;d say that it wasn&#39;t big enough to have obscured the moon had it flown over it. Also, it seemed to appear from the west - it was just there over the lake somewhat suddenly, but it&#39;s possible that nearby trees obscured it from my view.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My only thoughts on what it might have been is a balloon, but not a hot-air balloon. It seemed to be following a definite flight path - not randomly being carried by air currents and ascending and descending. Also, the shape seemed to be off.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;m wondering if anyone else saw this object today. It flew towards a very busy road during morning rush hour traffic - Highway 436 in Winter Park - when I lost sight of it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

A friend called me who lives 3 miles away and they were just appearing in our night view of the sky.  The cluster of balls were just below the ecliptic at approx. 10-2.  Travelling in form and as a single unit with 7 balls of light in total.  Visualized several single objects and one triangle formation of three at the end of the cluster. Disappeared into the marine layer over the ocean.  Steady speed continuously. I would estimate speed at 200 miles per hour. Objects were seen for approx. 7 minutes Note: These objects looked to me like the footage Jaime Muassan has of the daytime clusters of white orbs in Mexico City and the descriptions of Dr. Lynne Kieta and the Phoenix Lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Weather conditions were bright and clear with blue skies and some very patchy, high, thin, hazy and mostly transparent clouds. The clouds were not as high as cirrus clouds but they appeared quite high and were much higher than what one would call coastal haze.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The brightness of the object caught my attention through the window as it was quite intense somewhat like a bright star at night or the landing lights on a plane at dusk. This was however quite out of the ordinary as it was a very bright sunny day. The object also appeared to be still in the sky. After staring at it for a while and asking my friend to take a look and tell me what he thought it might be  I went outside for a better view.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was visiting my friend and asked it he had any binoculars but he didn’t so I was left to scrutinize the object with my naked eyes. I am a visual artist and an avid birder so my observation skills are fairly strong.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was to the north of my position and the sun would have been to the south east. The object was moving in a straight line from east to west very slowly. I could observe that it was traveling just beneath the high clouds as it would occasionally dip slightly into them. When I was viewing it through the some what dirty window I noticed that it would disappear and then reappear with the same intensity. I thought that perhaps it was becoming obscured by the clouds. However when seen from outside the house I could see that when it was not shining with a bluish light it would turn completely black as in pure black and not at all grayish as it might have been if there were some atmospheric interference. In it’s black phase I got the impression that it was shaped somewhat like a very shallowly curved fingernail clipping with the con caved side down, the convex side up and pointed on the ends.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am not an aviation expert but I believe I could safely say that no conventional aircraft could fly that slowly except for an ultra light and I don’t think that ultra lights fly at such high altitudes. There was an airliner flying above it and it’s rate of movement across the sky was much faster than object in question even thought the air liner was at a much higher altitude. I considered that if it were an ultra light the top side of the wing might be made of a highly reflective material such as a blue tinted mylar while the bottom was either non reflective or simply not catching the light. In that case it would have had to be changing it’s degree of tilt in relation to my point of observation in order to cause the on and off effect. However it’s trajectory looked straight, slow and steady.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When lighted it seemed to be emitting light just like a bright star but I wondered if it might not simply be reflecting the sun.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As the object moved far into the west and eventually went out of sight it continued to appear as thought the light were emitted from it. Im not sure if anything could change it’s position that much relative to my point of observation and still reflect the sun with the same intensity directly to my eyes. I have never seen anything like it and I’ll be watching for other reports about it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Some brief info on me: 19 years employed at UPS as receiving counter clerk, 14 years teaching art and music in state prison as a contract teacher for arts in corrections.

I could probably find about half the people to testify... it was an outdoor concert during this coffeeshop&#39;s last day open.  we&#39;re all early to late 20&#39;s  except for the owner, who i think saw them too, who i could contact, she lives in manhatten now.   we&#39;re located in jacksonville, fl and they were travelling south.  most of us, except the owner, are in the early to late twenties... i was stupid not to  call the news. it happened about 2 maybe 2 1/2 years ago.  and i was the only cool person there - based on a personal observation.   i bet somebody got it on their camera phone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> http://maps.google.com/maps?hl=en&amp;rlz=1C1DVZA_enUS346US347&amp;um=1&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;q=uncommon+grounds+coffee+shop+jacksonville+fl&amp;fb=1&amp;gl=us&amp;hq=uncommon+grounds+coffee+shop&amp;hnear=Jacksonville,+FL&amp;cid=0,0,2456018304246050171&amp;ei=zCuNTKP4CsTflgfwsbVi&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=local_result&amp;ct=image&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CBYQnwIwAAA   all of use were standing in that parking lot to the right while watching an indi rock band play...  it was travelling south, a little south east but directly at 0y...<n> <n><n> <n><n> here&#39;s some addiction stuff that probably doesn&#39;t matter. i was driving down 3rd st N a1a N  (map at bottom), at jax beach, and saw the same style &#34;ufo&#34; as my grandma and her neighbor saw in the 70&#39;s... football shaped. but hers moved by quickly,  mine flashed in an out and i was like... oh hey did you see that?  girlfriend was looking at her cell phone or something.   this is the crazy part that no-body will believe probably, but i&#39;ve been abducted while paralyzed at least 15 times in the past year since i&#39;ve seen it... and just the other night, while laying down, i saw an object flash in front of... it was black and seemed to be alive, but definately technology.  it was sweet looking... way cooler than any science fiction i&#39;ve ever seen.  since my friend experience though, i&#39;ve been able to remote view more often.  i just figured out that&#39;s really what it actually is.<n> <n><n> <n><n> http://maps.google.com/maps?hl=en&amp;rlz=1C1DVZA_enUS346US347&amp;um=1&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;q=uncommon+grounds+coffee+shop+jacksonville+fl&amp;fb=1&amp;gl=us&amp;hq=uncommon+grounds+coffee+shop&amp;hnear=Jacksonville,+FL&amp;cid=0,0,2456018304246050171&amp;ei=zCuNTKP4CsTflgfwsbVi&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=local_result&amp;ct=image&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CBYQnwIwAA<n>

Realizing that Venus is normally the brightest object in the sky, I assumed it must be a plane and stared at it for a bit to see if it was moving.  It did appear to be approaching so I kept trying to make my eyes focus on it.  Rather than one bright light as I am accustomed to seeing on airplanes in the early morning, this object appeared to have a ring of several lights, not exactly in a circle formation, but more like a closed half-circle.  I heard nothing, even though this object seemed to be fairly low.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I woke my husband to see if his eyes could make this object look like something we had seen before, but he agreed that the lights seemed to form this half-circle.  To be honest, I could not make my 45 year-old eyes focus well enough to count the lights, but there only seemed to be four or five at most.  As we watched it together for the next minute or so, it suddenly disappeared.  We ran outside to see if there was cloud cover, but there was not a cloud in sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was almost like a creature or a conscious craft.  It did not seem manned.  It was definitely not a craft made by man, either.  It seemed other-worldly.  Almost could be an inter-dimensional traveling creature.  Almost could be described as the Grim-Reaper for lack of any real discription.  We all saw it.

Observed bright lights just above treeline.  Watched it turn and move south. Disappeared below treeline, 30 seconds later it was moving north, gaining altitude, stopped, and shot straight up, disappearing from sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Second object was on north side of the road, again just above treeline, was visible between trees for about 1 minute. When view cleared past trees, it was gone. It appeared as if light from the ground was reflecting off bottom. But that area is very wooded, no known lights in that area. Goldish yellow in color. Approximately 300 feet across and two stories high. Lights across the back end when it turned.<n>

Initially I thought they were from fireworks but they did not disappear for several seconds. They appeared to be planes flying in formation but movement was erratic. Lights moved around slightly and began to disappear after about a minute or two. Then three lights reappeared at about the same place and appeared to move northward to then disappear towards the east. I filmed one of them towards the end of the sighting.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was traveling slowly from north to south, approximately 1000 to 1500 ft in the air. And I would estimate that it was about 1 to 1.5 miles away. It stayed over the water of the southwest coast the whole time. From where I was sitting, it was about half a thumb&#39;s width in size. At one mile out, that&#39;s quite large. The whole incident took maybe 3 or 4 minutes. It stalled in the air, and then blinked out rapidly in what appeared to be a southwesterly direction. It didn&#39;t seem to go up, but rather straight over, even with the line of the horizon. There were no sounds.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The objects appeared to move in a South-West direction. We stopped the car on Soledad Mtn Road where several vehicles had already stopped to observe the phenomenon. At this location the lights were very clearly visible for several minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Possible party lanterns, but that is a guess.  Many other reports.  PD))<n>

There was no sound that we could hear or blinking as on an airplane. Each light faded one at a time with one moving away from the other on the bottom of the L formation.  They disappeared in about 10 minutes.  They were neither airplanes nor fireworks.  I was wondering if anyone else had seen them too.

A light in the sky caught my eye, I looked and saw what apeared to be a oval/round object in the sky. The direction of travel was from west to east.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object had red and white lights on edges but appeared to have what looked like a burning fire underneath. The craft made no noise. The elevation of the craft I would put above 15,000 ft. Very odd as it looked almost like it was burning. I went back in the house and told the rest, they came out and witnessed it too. I was not going to say anything about this until I heard about the ufo seen over Texas this past week. I have not believed reports about &#34;ufos&#34; until I witnessed this for myself.<n>

It was mesmerizing to see the perfect balls of light moving and shifting groupings. We were near Mount Soledad, La Jolla. It was approx. 00: 20 hours. I picked up my son, so now there were 4 witnesses. We were heading north on I 5. This time there were 9 of them (we counted carefully). It was approx. 00: 30 hours.

The color changed from very dip red to orange/yellow. A few minutes after I went into the house to see if someone reported an astronomic event to explain this phenomenon. This light show up bellow the Taurus constellation (north-east), at around 20-30 digress above the horizon.

They formed an acute triangle but appeared to be individual, not 3 lights on the corners of a single triangle shape.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The lights did not blink or appear as normal navigation lights on airplanes from what I could see, nor did they look like any sort of ground-launched fireworks. Maybe they were flares dropped from high altitude.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I watched them for about a minute before deciding to get my binoculars for a better look.   It only took about a minute to get them and when I returned outside the lights were gone.    No weird noises, no sparks, no unusual movements.

It was bright enough that it caught our eyes thru the windows. We were in differnt rooms and differnt floors but both saw it and ran out to try to see what it was.  It really looked like a miniature hotair ballon with a orange glow or fire color.  Object would rise and lower and moved very slowly.  It was not far away 200&#39; or so but made absolutely no noise.  No strong winds or inclement weather, object was clearly visible and easy to see.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Object just seemed to disappear as I was watching it.   I would like to say that this object has been reported locally several times in the last few months.

I looked out to see what they were talking about, and what we saw was a slow-moving, bright orange fireball looking object. It was going straight South towards the next village over, Akula, Alaska.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My sisters and brother and a few others were outside and saw the exact same thing. I ran outside with my aunt to take a better look, and it was still moving south in a steady pace. It looked almost exactly like a meteor, except it was moving very slowly. There were about 3 points behind the head of it, like it was burning up, but there were no tails that are usually associated with meteors. There were no sounds whatsoever.<n> <n><n> <n><n> While it was getting further away, it was getting dimmer, and the more it seemed to go away from us, rather than passing by, it started disappearing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It slowed down for a few seconds, changed direction, and turned again, and resumed at the same speed it was going in the beginning of the sighting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I don&#39;t know what that was, but everyone where we were saw it. One of the witnesses is a police officer and is very knowledgeable about things in the night sky and the surrounding areas, having been in night shifts a lot the past few years.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was at least a mile away, and at most 2 miles away. Still it was huge and bright.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I live in a village where planes pass a lot, and I know what they look like during the day and at night. The lights and the shape looked nothing like a plane. Planes that low and close are usually loud. Especially on a night as calm as tonight. After observing the object as it passed for a few minutes, everyone here agrees that it wasn&#39;t a plane either.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

They traveled about halfway accross the sky and then disappeared. Then we saw another similar light. It stopped in the middle of the sky and just hung there for about five minutes, not moving, then disappearing. These lights were way up there, and were not planes, no blinking lights, and no sound. Daughter&#39;s boyfriend conjectured that they may have been some type of lit weather ballons.... But there were so many of them, and their flight pattern was so fixed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with this witness, and he sounded to us to be quite sober-minded.

I watched these glowing discs and knew they were not firworks, airplanes or helicopters. I continued to watch as they faded from view. All this was going on while the fireworks were going on the strip. The discs had what appeared to be a glowing orange field around them each.

We all started arguing about what the object was, comet, plane, metorite, it looked as though part of it fell off of it , or another smaller craft seperarted from it. then it just &#34;turned off&#34; or used some sort of cloaking devise. then about 3 min later it reapperd for only a couple of seconds, then dissapered for good. haven&#39;t seen anything like this before and i&#39;ve seen comets and meteors before.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Possible party lanterns??  We&#39;re unsure as to what the objects were, although one witness assures us that they did not act like drifting lights.  PD))<n>
1/1/08 00:00|Burbank|CA|Light|1/2 Hour|Orange-Red lights seen over Burbank, CA on New Years.  ((NUFORC Note:  Possible party lanterns??  PD))|1/21/08|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/060/S60734.html|472|ndxe200801| Orange-Red lights seen over Burbank, CA on New Years<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was about 00:15 when a partygoer told the rest of the party to look into the sky over Burbank. There were five orange-red lights hovering in the Eastern sky, pretty close to the surface. They were silent. At first they were hovering in the formation of a dice, number 5 side up. Then one came out of formation to the south and then another right next to it. The last 3 stayed in a triangle formation for about 10 minutes. Meanwhile the first light to move south faded out. After that, the second light out of formation moved quickly in the place of the first and disappeared. There seemed to be a trail of exhaust left by the second light when it vanished. The other three lights in the formation of a triangle remained for another 15 minutes, then all vanished. It was like nothing I had ever seen before. For some reaon there was no cell phone service for any of the phones of partygoers. The next day at about 14:00, two F-16 fighter jets landed at Burbank airport. You could see planes landing at the airport from the house. I don’t know if this was just a coincidence.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Possible party lanterns, but that is a guess.

After five minutes, each orange light faded out one by one. Two of the lights hung just above the other three which were in a straight row.  None of the lights ever moved.  As we each looked through binoculars for a closer look, we couldn&#39;t make out any kind of form or craft. We weren&#39;t able to get video of the event.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Possible party lanterns, but that is a guess.  Many other reports.  PD))<n>
